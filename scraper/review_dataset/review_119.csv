119,Beautiful luxury yacht moored in the Royal Victoria Dock,"Beautiful luxury yacht moored in the Royal Victoria Dock.  We spent two nights for a wedding anniversary.  I can't fault apart from the cost of food and drinks.  We paid for B&B which was brilliant.  There are lots of places around and about to eat and drink.  It's right next to the Excel centre.  Everywhere was spotless, staff were polite and attentive.  I highly recommend.",5,2024,10,18
119,A must try afternoon tea ,"Very friendly team. My family took me here for afternoon tea as a birthday present. It is an amazing experience. The tea was great (far too many goodies for a 70 year old!) and the service was excellent. The team deserve naming because they were all very friendly and helpful. So a big thank you to Raj, Amy, Abi and Raluca.
I would definitely come again and recommend that you give it a try. Worth the trip to Custom House!",5,2024,10,18
119,"Great stay, but for the extra charge","Excellent place to stay when visiting Excel centre.  Very comfortable, spacious rooms.  Good breakfast with a wide variety of choices.  Didn't have dinner there, but there are plenty of resturants within few minutes walk.  One niggle was the extra charge for 'tax recovery charges' on top of the room rate per night.  I have never to my knowledge been charged this before, and the explanation on the booking confirmation was vague to say the least.  It was a fairly substantial amount and I have no idea why it was added to the bill.  Other than that it was a really enjoyable stay.",5,2024,10,14
119,5*,"Can only give this place 5 star! From check-in they were 15 mins late however, offered us a complimentary drink. The front desk are helpful and polite. Our room was clean and spacious. The view we had was amazing. Our heating wasn't working properly and was blowing cold air. This was fixed promptly. The staff in general are pleasant. We had dinner on the yacht and it was very nice, (could have done with bigger portions) the breakfast was excellent in the morning. I had rang previously to let them know we were celebrating my partners birthday, as a nice gesture they had put complimentary chocolates on the table  and rose petals on the bed. Could not fault this place. Definitely coming back!!",5,2024,10,07
119,Lovely afternoon tea on Thames,Lovely fresh afternoon tea in a unique and luxury venue with great service and good veggie options. Got to have a look around parts of the yacht too. Would love to go back and stay as a hotel guest. Super easy access to cable car and Elizabeth line and dlr,5,2024,10,07
119,Bad!,"Unbelievably disappointed, it was my partners birthday and we had been so excited for this stay, so disappointed with the service and cleanliness. We went to the bar to order drinks we had been told
It was a 10-15min wait to order a drink so we left and had drinks else where. The bathroom/shower filthy! Only 1 working lift so took ages everytime to get in from outside! Ended up on the service lift at the back of the kitchen at one point! Breakfast well we felt rushed as the waiters kept just standing and staring at people who had finished their food but still sitting as people queuing and waiting
to be seated.",1,2024,10,06
119,Overnight stay at The Sunborn Yacht.,"First impressions 10/10. The reception area was just Wow!...Absolutely stunning!! The rooms were spotless and very grand. Great view from our room too. Comfy bed ,no problems with the shower,constant hot water . The only issues we had were the coffee maker in the room which we just couldn't get working,despite a maid showing us how to operate it. We are convinced it was faulty;It just flooded hot water out everywhere. The other issue was the breakfast. We only gave it a 4/10. The bacon wasn't cooked and we found it got cold very quickly . Quite disappointing considering its a high star hotel. We decided to eat out as the food in the resturaunt was quite pricey. Plenty of local resturaunts though closeby to choose from. Would we stay here again? Yes.",4,2024,10,01
119,A ruined special occasion,The overnight stay with dinner in the Lands End restaurant was to celebrate my partner's birthday.  The hotel itself is very lovely and very unique.  Our problem was with the restaurant.  My partner's medium to well done fillet steak (£42) was beyond cremated.  My lobster linguine was an inedible garlic fest.  The dessert we both chose was equally bad with undercooked sliced apples on the tarte fin.  Total bill - £144!!,2,2024,10,01
119,Amazing,Stayed on the yatch with GB tours .check in a little chaotic with 40 or more people arriving at once but all sorted .went to our cabin it was gorgeous and we had a river view  which was stunning .it was immaculate so clean well laid out couldn't fault it .we didn't eat in the restaurant so can't comment .we had drinks in the bar expensive but it's London .the breakfast was very nice  the staff seemed very nice pleasant and and always said hello  the lifts were fun kept forgetting to swipe our cards so well done to everyone we loved it xx,5,2024,10,01
119,Sunborn  -  enjoy a drink onboard but perhaps head further into port for lodgings...,"A fun alternative hotel experience. Overall the hotel was good - the room was spotless, the hotel was clean and well maintained and the staff at the reception desk were welcoming and very helpful. Our bathroom had underfloor heating and was toasty warm but the room itself was cold. On inspection it appeared the heating control panel on the wall did nothing, and a member of the reception staff tried in vain to fix the issue - unfortunately there was no maintenance staff available at the time. Also worth noting the double bed isnt... it's two single beds pushed together with a topper mattress type thing across the bases. Sleep apart or prepare to fall into the gap between the beds! The bar is a nice area to have a drink - however the food was mediocre and the service disjointed. The bar staff  - although pleasant, spent a lot of their time wandering around trying to match up the orders to the tables. Perhaps table numbers would resolve the confusion? The breakfast is an odd layout - with hot drinks and juice at one end and food at the other, self service and again - the food here was mediocre to basic for what you are paying for. The coffee is 1970s hospital grade brown water but there are some nice cafes and take away coffee stands within a stone throw of the hotel - so get your java hit there. The general staff could do with being briefed on how the hospitality industry works - passing you in the corridor - a simple ""hello"" or holding a door open would not go astray. Basic manners were obviously not part of the training here. Not even a half hearted smile was on offer. In summary all the basics are here to make an average experience into something outstanding. Apart from the reception staff who were excellent - many working in the restaurant or bar appear to have lost the will to live. For example - My wife asked about an item in the restaurant and was given a one word answer - a gruff ""no"" as if she had just been dismissed by the head mistress! Other guests had a similar experience that weekend from what we heard and observed first hand, but this is my review and it would be unfair of me to attempt to portray the opinions of others. Unless you specifically want the gimmick of staying on a de-commissioned yacht I would suggest you spend your hard earned money on a good old fashioned bricks and mortar hotel. One that values its customers and focuses more on the client experience and hospitality industry rather than relying on it being a sort of water based ""funfair attraction"" to lure its clientele in. It was a nice idea but sadly there is nothing here in either the customer service department or food/restaurant area to warrant a return visit. It wasn't terrible, it just wasn't worth the price - and this could be a truly fantastic venue under better management and in the right hands!",3,2024,10,01
119,An enjoyable floating experience,A totally different hotel experience - the staff were welcoming and friendly and the cleanliness was top class.  The size of the rooms made the stay comfortable and the furnishings very nostalgic.  Thoroughly enjoyed the stay with the only negative comment being about the breakfast hence the 4 stars not 5.  Choice of breakfast was fantastic- lots to select from with the only negative being the cooked breakfast items were luke warm to cold so bear this in mind and do have an early breakfast as it gets very busy.,4,2024,09,29
119,Excellent stay.,"The stay here was excellent, the staff were amazing, polite and also very friendly. I would recommend this stay to anyone who wants to enjoy a romantic get away. The rooms very clean and tidy as well as the boat itself. I would recommend booking with Reshma ( the receptionist) as she was so helpful, polite and excellent at her job.",5,2024,09,29
119,Amazing,"What an absolute great novelty stay. Its not often youll get the opportunity to stay on a luxury yahct like this. Staff are so friendly and accomodating, the place is clean and easy to navigate your way round. The rooms are so spacious with everyrhing you could want for an overnight stay. It was an absolute pleasure to stay here and we will be sure to return. If i was to have 1 little thing thay id say could improve is the breakfadt wasnt as hot as id of liked but in no way would this be enough to mark this place down....amazing thanks to you all.",5,2024,09,27
119,"Stunning Room, Lovely Staff & Tasty Breakfast!","Our Yacht Executive River View Room was lovely. So spacious and clean. We had a lovely evening in front of the television and going back and forth to the balcony, taking in the beautiful view of the river and London City to our right… The lovely lady in the Reception was so sweet upon arrival and very helpful. The breakfast was tasty, so much to choose from. And check out was quick and efficient. Overall, such a fantastic experience. We will definitely be going back!!!",5,2024,09,23
119,Gabriel & Mohammad great service,I highly recommend this hotel. I was met by Mohammed and Gabriel at reception with a smile. They upgraded our room free of charge. The room was a great with a balcony over looking the Thames. I will be coming back very soon again. 5STARS!!!!!!!!,5,2024,09,22
119,Excellent service from Jade.,"Stayed for the first time at Sunborn London. Room and food were excellent. However, what really made they stay memorable was the service received from employe Jade. She went above and beyond with regard to a couple of issues, and I will defiantly stay at Sunborn again.",5,2024,09,20
119,Nice views and best time,I had the best stay nice staff I would defo go back life time experience you must do. Without the kids lol 😆 and me and partner went our anniversary and we had well of a time here food was loverly the views amazing  aswell as the staff go and visit for yourself 👏,5,2024,09,19
119,Perfect one night stay,"Lovely one night stay when visiting the Excel for exhibition.  Also onky 20 mins on Elizabeth Line to Central London.Everything was great from start to finish. Polite and helpful staff, lovely room overlooking the river. Nice full breakfast included",5,2024,09,17
119,Excellent stay,"Really love ambience around the hotel, very big and comfortable bed. Good choices on the buffet breakfast. Front of house manager Amara was amazing and super helpful throughout my stay and went the extra mile to make sure i was comfortable.",5,2024,09,16
119,Excellent stay at the Sunborn London.  We WILL be back.,"Liked · The quality and standard and size of the rooms (we had a river view classic king cabin) were superb. The location is good with easy access to the DLR customs house station, excel right next door and the cable cars over the Thames less than 5 mins walk. Breakfast was excellent, a wide range of hot and cold food, all fresh and very well presented. And great value for money, we got it less than some of the budget hotels nearby. Contrary to some site details, they have disabled bays for parking directly outside. Call the hotel in advance to arrange access through their barrier at the end of Western Gateway opposite the Passport Office entrance.

Disliked · Evening meal was a bit pricey and we gave it a miss. We ate in the bar, fairly quiet as it was midweek, limited range of food available. No dedicated disabled toilet.
The hotel is in the docklands area, which is a bit of a trek out of the city. About 15-20 mins from Custom House to Tower Gateway or Bank stations. We used Tower Gateway as it's literally 2 mins walk from the Tower of London and 5 mins to Tower Bridge",5,2024,09,15
119,Unprofessional management,I booked to go to sunborn hotel for my partners birthday as a treat it was all going well untill we found our bed completely soaked in urine ! We went to reception right away and they moved us . We did put a complaint in but we were basically called liars a few days later throw email saying it wasn’t urine it must have been water and that was from the manger their 😡 I would never step back in this place !,1,2024,09,11
119,Outstanding hotel and well worth the money !,"The Sunborn London is a STUNNING hotel to stay in in many ways.  A very special thankyou to Kiran (hope that's the correct spelling) as he helped us with an error, on our behalf, to make our stay very special !  Thankyou, very much appreciated.  Also a thankyou to the guy in the breakfast area, he was a really nice host and a pleasure to see and meet each morning (sorry didn't see your name)

The breakfast is amazing, the interior is amazing, the exterior is amazing....fantastic all round !

Only a couple of very very minor corrections we strongly think should be made however....only small !  The hot food trays at breakfast everyone seems to struggle with as there is nowhere to put the lids whilst you take your food....most definately invest on a few hot trays with lids that open up would be of benefit.  Also the water pressure in the rooms is really low...some type of booster pumps would help, along with sinks that drain as ours took about 10mins to drain away.  That aside still stunning rooms etc :-)

Thankyou, we will for sure be back :-)",5,2024,09,11
119,"Unique hotel experience, good staff, easy to reach by public transit","The Sunborn London is a unique hotel venue, it's not every day you can say that you stayed on a large yacht! It comes at a bit of a price above the usual, but not by much. It was easy to reach from Heathrow... get onto the Elizabeth Line and get off the train at Custom House station, walk 5 minutes and you're there. The DLR train also stops at the Custom House station. As we got there before check-in time, the staff kindly secured our luggage in a locked luggage room and gave us tags so that nobody else could get our luggage. 

Our room was accessible via one of 3 lifts which are card-activated, we were on the first floor (closest to the waterline). As the yacht is in a quay off the Thames, there's no feeling of waves or motion. If you didn't know you're on a yacht, you'd never know. The rooms are very soundproof, we never heard our neighbours. The suite was massive, the bed was well kept and clean as was all of the furniture. The bathroom was well appointed and well maintained. You have a choice to reuse your towels or get new each day. 

If you have a choice, pick a room which faces south towards the water/quay for privacy and also a nice view.

Our price included the breakfast buffet, which was reasonable, but not massive. We did see families there with youngish children, but for the most part the other guests were like us... vacationing couples. The buffet has a single coffee machine, the line up can take some patience, but as there aren't hundreds of guests, the wait is never more than 2 or 3 others. The selection of pastries gets depleted quickly, so get those before everyone else does! Otherwise, there's a good selection of cheese, breads, fruits, muffins and eggs. Fresh orange juice is a daily drink, there are other juices as well. 

There are meeting rooms on the main reception level and aside the breakfast buffet. There is also an outdoor deck for breakfast, and on the upper floor for the nightclub, although we didn't sit outside we thought them both enjoyable. 

We did not eat in the hotel restaurant, but there are numerous restaurants around the quay, all within easy walking distance of the Sunborne. Some signs caution you not to have your phone visible when walking around the quay, although we didn't see any riff-raff when we walked around in the evening. 

The hotel location is away from the core of London, so it's not as noisy as one might think. Despite being immediately adjacent to London City Airport, we did not hear jets through the windows, and only faintly through the breakfast area windows. To reach downtown, simply walk to the station and get on the tube on either the DLR or Elizabeth Line. You can tap as you go using a credit card. 

The hotel is well kept, the outdoor park-square is used by local residents and hotel guests from neighbouring hotels as a play area. There's also a large convention centre between the Sunborne and the Tube line, so it's convenient to many things, and remote enough to enjoy some peace and quiet.",5,2024,09,11
119,Excellent experience,"Stayed here whilst visiting London for a special occasion, and was extremely impressed. The whole place, including the lobby, staircase and bar area, all feels very luxurious. 

The room was spacious and clean, the staff were all very friendly and helpful, and check-in / check-out were efficient so we weren't hanging about for long. 

At one point we lost a piece of property (due to our own mistake) and the staff were very helpful in aiding us to find it. 

Special shout-out to Bela who works in the restaurant, and was very friendly and personable. 

All round great experience and we shall definitely be returning!",5,2024,09,11
119,Breakfast mediocre,"Great venue, and plenty of staff on hand.
However, food was a real let down. It’s either very expensive for what you get in the restaurant ( we gave the food an 8/10 ) or very basic for the breakfast ( a definite 4/10 ). Food choice was limited, fried eggs piled up on top of each other, with lots of broken yolks, basic bread for toast, liquiddy baked beans, bland tomatoes etc, etc. We would rather have paid extra for breakfast, and had better quality.
But the location is amazing, and staff very friendly.",3,2024,09,08
119,Absolutely Fantastic!!,"After deliberating over several different places to go to to celebrate my 50th birthday, we found this absolute gem via Secret Escapes.  Their own website said I couldn't book the dates and the room I wanted, which Secret Escapes said I could.  So I phoned them direct to double check and were told the dates were available and was immediatly offered a cheaper rate including breakfast, beating Secret Escapes by nearly £100!  As a result we booked the afternoon tea for the day of arrival.

The yacht looks fantastic from the exterior and the interior does not let it down.  Its like walking into sheer elegance.  Huge double staircase in the centre with gold decoration everywhere.  

A lift takes you to reception.  We were half an hour early but given the key to our room within 5 minutes.  We had a level one river view room which didn't disappoint.  Really spacious with a nice little living room area.  Some would say it looks dated, but the wood finishings everywhere really give an authentic 'marine' feel to the whole yacht.

Once you are inside you can't access any of the room areas without using your room card, either via the doors or even in the lift.  So no random people can access anywhere other than reception and the bar and restaurant areas.

The Lands End restaurant puts on a great buffet breakfast with loads of choice to really set you up for a day of whatever you have planned.  We got room service on the first night as we had indulged in the superb afternoon tea already.  Easy to order through the Sunborn London app and delivered really quickly piping hot.  You pay for this when they deliver it so no nasty suprises when you check out!

We then booked a table for dinner in the restaurant on night two.  All I can say is WOW!  The choice on the menu is a bit limited if you are a vegie like my wife.  Several
meat based items for the carnivores (Chicken, Lamb, Beef), and three fish options (Lobster Tagliatelle, Sea Bream), but only a vegetable rissotto for her.  And only two vegie starter options.

Having said that she went for the rissotto and was over the moon with it, and I had the Lobster Tagliatelle which absolutely blew me away!  So tasty!

The service was amazing with every person we came into contact with.  There are umbrellas to hire at £3 a day if need be.  And you can sit and have a coffee or just admire the amazing views across towards Canary Wharf and the O2 from the back of the boat, which at night looks stunning.

London City airport is literally just down the river so there was a bit of noise from departing planes on Friday and Saturday, but didn't hear a thing on Sunday.

As for things to do, we were there to visit the F1 Exhibition in the Excel centre which is literally a 1 minute walk away. And also the Art of the Brick exhibition in Brick Lane, which we just hailed an Uber to get to.  (First time using Uber for both of us!).

Overall it was a great choice as far as we are concerned.  We would like to stay longer next time (yes we will be back) and will go for a balcony river view room for a change.  

As far as getting there, you can either get the train and get off at Custom House outside the Excel on the Elizabeth Line.  Or like us (as the wife is not keen on the trains), you can drive and there is lots of choice on parking.  We booked a spot at the Crown Plaza Hotel just round the corner via Just Park, which is an easy 10 minute walk along the river.  

Cost wise, it is a lot cheaper than you think it will be, which suprised us and ultimately is what made us book it.  Eating on the boat is not cheap, but your in London, its not going to be wherever you go.  But the quality of the dishes is top notch and worth every penny.

The only things I would improve - The wife mentioned that the mirror in the room for her to get ready at, needs lights to make doing her hair and makeup easier.  Oh, that appears to be the only thing!!

And does the boat move?!  The wife seemed to think it did but I didn't notice anything.  Having said that the Thames was pretty calm anyway and obviously it is well and truely fixed to the quayside!",5,2024,09,08
119,Fabulous stay,Fantastic place to stay. The area is peaceful at night.  The place is stunning and spotless. The staff were very welcoming and gave us an upgrade. The rooms are very spacious and the beds comfortable. The breakfast was fantastic and plenty to choose from. Very close to the underground station.,5,2024,09,08
119,Great fun,"We stayed here as a family at the end of August for 4 nights which in hignsight now was a bit too long, 2 nights would have left a better impression. We took the Family Exuctive room which was lovely , very comfortable. Staying on the yacht is a lovely experience. Its very grand , the bar is a nice area to relax and have some drinks. The only thing that lets this place down is the inexperience of the staff and the breakfast. The staff cant remember you from one day to the next so you end up having all the same conversations. The breakfast was very poor quality in comparrison to other hotels Ive stayed in in the area just days prior to our visit here. That all said we didnt let it spoil our break,  but it did stop us from booking the restuarant as the standard had been set so I wanted to avoid any further disapointment . We ended up finding a wonderful italian resturant very close by where we dined mostly everynight check my other review.",4,2024,09,08
119,Avoid not worth the money,"Check in was swift room clean.
dirty dishes in corridor ordered pizza no cutlery napkins given breakfast no saucers luke warm food not good at all. Dirty plates not taken away.
What can we say about the bar ordered Irish coffee we were told  after half hour of waiting they only have 5 glasses so cannot serve us as they have run out of glasses ordered a beer too only ot be told we only serve both drinks together what a shamble of a place.
we paid alot of money to stay here no atmosphere  at all definitely would never stay again.
Requested to speak to manager who seemed to find a glass within minutes and bring us pur drinks.
Better places to stay in London avoid wasting your money run by unprofessional staff",1,2024,09,07
119,Poor House keeping,"First impression was good, however poor bar restaurant service for which we were over charged, obvious lack of staff as there were several dirty tables of used glasses and crockery.  When we eventually checked in we made our way to our room at approx 4.30pm only to be met with a tray of dirty dishes outside our door with another tray of dirty cups etc just across from our room, not the welcome I would have expected. The room itself was clean and comfortable and the housekeeping was as you would expect. Breakfast was very good and the staff were attentive.",3,2024,09,07
119,2 nights on the Sunborn Yacht Hotel,"I spent the past couple of nights at the Sunborn Yacht Hotel and absolutely loved it. The room was spacious and well furnished. Breakfast was great with lots of choice. I want to mention Bela who greeted us and looked after us at breakfast both mornings. He is an absolute diamond and a real credit to the hotel. Friendly, funny and very helpful. Bela made the stay even better - I wanted to take him home with me!  
Thank you - Sally",5,2024,09,04
119,Amazing stay!,Maris on the front desk was such a helpful resource and very friendly. We was helped an awful lot and he made the stay a hundred times more enjoyable for my husbands birthday. We are yet to enjoy the restaurant but so far so good and we are very pleased. Great location and such a luxury room,5,2024,09,03
119,An ok stay.,"Stayed here this weekend for our tenth wedding anniversary. Hotel was nice, a little attention and updating needed to the decor in the hallways. My Husband paid for the luxury package and in all honesty, it was lovely, but for the price was it worth it? Probably not. Staff on reception were all really nice. We were informed on check in that the bar on the deck was hired for a function so we couldn’t use it. This I feel should have been addressed beforehand. Didn’t sleep great but this was due to another very heavy footed guest that seemed to be doing laps around their room all night. It was literally shaking our room. Breakfast wasn’t the best we have ever had. Beans stone cold, hash browns soggy. Was nice to experience something different. Would we stay again? No, it didn’t exactly wow us.",4,2024,09,01
119,Perfect stay,"Booked as Bday getaway & f1 exhibition for husband so only 1 night stay & our stay made up for the disappointing f1 experience.  Staff all very accommodating , happy & greeted us with smiles, room not ready on our arrival but we were early, but could store our bags whilst explored so no issues.  Had nice upgrade to 5th floor, whole of the top deck, which was a nice gesture, and we were very grateful, clean room, comfy bed, mini bar , amazing views , ate in restaurant twice food good, staff attentive cannot fault any of it, breakfast had good selection something for everyone, anytime we are back in London this will be our stay of choice 
Thank you Sunborn for letting us live like celebrities for a day/night!",5,2024,08,31
119,MadDog gets Lucky,"The MadDogs have stayed here a few times in the past and have always had a fab time. Mrs M has started booking with the Sunborn direct, which has proved to be the cheapest and if there is availability you can get an upgrade. So........

................We received an e-mail a month before we arrived stating that we had been entered into a draw and had won an upgrade and dinner for two!! Excellent!!
MadDog misread the e-mail and thought we had won an executive room, but no dear reader when we arrived it transpired it was a Riverview suite Wow!
This suite is the nuts, loads of room everywhere. Spread over three large rooms, bedroom ,living room and bathroom.Mrs M and myself were a bit awestruck. Sauna, whirlpool bath, side by side showers and top quality toiletries. Three piece suite and dining table and chairs, big telly and Mrs M's favourite thing in the whole world a complimentary mini bar with some very nice chocolates. The suite is finished mostly in naval light oak (well it is a ship) which is themed throughout and lots of polished brass. Took MadDog back to his time as a Matelot. Couple all this with the biggest balcony/terrace on the Thames, wonderful views of the city, a nice sunny day and Bob's your uncle!

The MadDogs always have a stroll around the local area when in town for a drink or two, as there are good few places to chose from within a stones throw. That though is of minor importance when compared with what's coming next......

MadDog was once trained in the culinary arts (besides other nefarious arts and skills I can't talk about here) and considers himself a bit of a Gastro!  Lets just say the food here is a bit special.With Balik Salmon and a homemade terrine for starters, followed up with a Lamb rump that was sublime and Mrs M in seafood (tagliatelle) heaven we were complete, except for a cheeseboard and chocolate fondant that we managed to squeeze in. Service was impeccable. The whole dining thing was fantastic! Well done Chef!

The whole experience was spot on from check in with smiley people to check out, with all the tears (the MadDogs are a bit emotional at times). A really good stay, but then it always is. 
Thank You.

MadDog says Heave To Ya Lubbers!",5,2024,08,30
119,Sunborn Yacht surprise upgrade,"My wife and I stayed on the Sunborn Yacht Hotel from 28/8/24 to 29/8/24. This was a present for our 50th Wedding Anniversary.
Check in was fast and efficient. We were upgraded to a Junior Suite Room 5033, this was such a lovely surprise and thank you to all the staff on Sunborn for making this occasion special for us.
Breakfast is buffet with full english and continental choices.
We had a 3 course evening meal in the Lands End Restaurant and the food and service was first class.
I would highly recommend a stay on this luxurious Yacht, 3 mintues walk to cable car to the O2 and DLR station for forward journeys. We used Excel centre to park our car.",5,2024,08,30
119,Very comfortable…,"Very friendly check in. Got free upgrade to room with balcony. Very comfortable room, quiet at night. Excellent, good quality cooked breakfast (buffet) eat as much as you want. Nice bar area with a decent pale ale. Would definitely come here again.",5,2024,08,29
119,"Impressive suite, bathroom & balcony","We did the ""romantic package"" - impressive suite, bathroom & balcony 100% lush. Bathroom had large corner jacuzzi bath plus a sauna and twin showers. Separate toilet in addition to the one in the bathroom. Included was gown, slippers and stocked mini bar. 
Food was good, menu a touch limited but food well cooked.",5,2024,08,29
119,Lovely experience,Just had 3 nights here. Was great. Friendly staff spotless rooms. Breakfast was good too plently to choose from.very good value for money. We dined in lands end retaurant food was good however was very expensive. 95.00 for 1 taglitelli and 1 lamb main one course. I dont drink but dread to think what it would be if alcohol were added.but its a beautiful hotel in london so we expected it. Thank you to all the staff who couldnt do enough for you.definitely will be back,4,2024,08,29
119,"Make sure you read all the reviews, same problems seem to crop up !","We booked the executive room with river view, it was our wedding anniversary which we advised them off but no acknowledgement of this when we arrived, most hotels do at least put a happy anniversary note on the bed but hey no not a problem. Check in was at 3pm but as we had arrived at 2pm we asked if our room was ready but told no but to come back in half hour and advised to wait in the bar area, we ordered 2 drinks at the bar but were told it was table service, so we waited about 15 minutes for our drinks to arrive even though it wasn't busy, we then had to pay a 10% service charge for the privilege of table service, we would have much preferred to get our drinks at the bar. We then went to reception at 2.30 as advised and were told no rooms are available until 3pm, I said we were told to ask again at  2.30 and were told not until 3pm, they didn't even take our names to check. Other people were coming in to check in and they were told no rooms available until 3 even before they had walked up to the reception desk which I thought was rude, all guests were told to wait in the bar which was getting busy by now as all the guests were waiting for 3pm, I think this is done so guests spend money on the over inflated drinks there whilst waiting. Surely some of the rooms were ready, it seems silly to make guests queue to check in as it gets very congested in the reception. We we were given a room on floor 5, our room was nice, big and airy with a small balcony but the chairs to sit on which were on the balcony has rips in them. Bed was big and comfy but the sheets were so starched and crispy that they were very stiff and noisy when turning over in bed. We didn't sleep well at all, there is a strange beeping squeaky noise coming from somewhere that was going on all night, also at about 2am there was the most disgusting smell in the room, it smelt of either sewage or stagnant drains and made me feel sick, this smell stayed in the room all night ( and when I looked at another review on here I noticed another guest had noticed the same thing) The smell wasn't there when we arrived but started in the early hours, not sure if it was coming through the air vent/ air conditioning but it was awful. We went down for breakfast at 8.30 am and it was quite busy, the drinks area where you help yourself to tea and coffee etc was very small and people were getting in each others way and there were no teaspoons just wooden sticks , which isn't really what a 4* hotel should provide, my husband had the cooked breakfast which was luke warm and under cooked and too many people getting in each others way as it was self service. We left straight after as we couldn't bear staying in the smelly room any longer, when we checked out we were asked if everything was okay with our stay, when I replied no as the room smelt awful and we hadn't slept he just replied oh I am sorry about that, he should have said he would look into it and let the manager know but he just didn't care or offer an explanation. All in all it was a nice experience staying on a yacht and the reception and stairs had the wow factor and the room was nice too but the other issues let it down, also the surrounding area is a bit grimy and nothing much to do. We would not return unfortunately which is a shame as we were looking forward to this for our wedding anniversary. Also when we arrived we had to enter by a lift but every time someone else outside pressed the button for the lift it would go there so we were riding the lift up and down 3 times before we could get to reception or our room.",3,2024,08,28
119,A bland experience,"I was really looking forward to this, a 40th birthday treat but left feeling underwhelmed. The boat itself looks impressive on arrival but the lifts were busy and a large group delayed us entering. 
The room itself was spacious and felt somewhat grand, yet very dated. The bed was very comfy and we had fun in London overall. 
The buffet breakfast was really bad. Fatty bacon, tasteless everything and the scrambled eggs looked like they were made with water. It looked and tasted very budget, not what I expected from this place so I’m glad we booked dinner elsewhere. Staff looked really flat and miserable so I wouldn’t return!",3,2024,08,28
119,Bought as a gift and will buy again.,I bought this as a gift for my nephew and his partner. They had a lovely time.  Stated the rooms were comfortable and they had a good nights sleep.  Lots to do in the location and really enjoyed the food in the onboard restaurant.. I will book this again for other relatives as a gift.,5,2024,08,27
119,Nice hotel,"Lovely Hotel, very clean, and all the staff are very welcoming, two points not happy with, was me and my wife went to the bar to buy a drink the waiter said it’s table service so take a seat we waited 15 minutes and he didn’t turn up, the second thing is the bed has two mattress toppers wrapped round a king size sheets these toppers are for a sofa bed, where is the mattress?",4,2024,08,27
119,One night at the Sunborn,"Stayed one night at the Sunborn as a birthday treat.First impression was good swift check in… room clean very comfy  bed spacious  and even had a sofa…. great decor.Tea and coffee facilities with water in the fridge .
Didn’t eat at the restaurant but there was a good choice at breakfast.
All of the staff were pleasant and helpful.
Would definitely return.",5,2024,08,27
119,Birthday overnight stay,"Took my girlfriend for a overnight stay at the Sunborn Yacht Hotel, it was an amazing experience, the staff was very welcoming on arrival, we checked In smoothly, no complaints with our room, 10/10 space and attention to detail. If there were anything to improve the rooms it would be to modernise the bathroom and also a bigger TV in the main room, other than that it was perfect. 

The hotel itself was very impressive, in the reception area there was a golden staircase and chandelier, it also featured a restraunt and sky bar. The interior was simply stunning and the theme of the boat felt very luxurious and classy. 

My only complaint was the Breakfast, it was very disappointing that the food was cold, the variety was very basic, although the range of selection was good, fry up, fruits and yogurt, pastries, a Buffett style breakfast. Overall I would give this Hotel a 4/5 purely for the experience of staying on a yacht, that in itself was cool.",4,2024,08,27
119,Bedbugs and Dirty Underpants,"We purchased a stay at the Sunborn London  as a gift for our friend’s special birthday celebrations.

The rooms were a good size and we ate at their restaurant in the evening. The waiter was quite abrupt when taking our order and informed one of our group that they could not change the choice of potato that accompanied their dish due to ‘portion control’. We also had to ask for our drinks order three times before they were eventually delivered.

The following morning as we were packing to leave my wife noticed a flat bug on the bed with some fresh blood next to it. We immediately informed reception who sent two people to the room. They took the offending bug away to ‘check if it was actually a bedbug or some other insect’.  When they had left we investigated further to see if there were any further signs of bedbugs. When we lifted the mattress we found an old pair of underpants next to additional signs of bedbugs.

We informed reception of our further issues and were told that we would be contacted in a few days after they had concluded their own investigation. A couple of days later we were told that their specialist company had found no signs of a bedbug infestation and that there was no further treatment required. In fact, the report that they sent us clearly stated that the bug was indeed a bedbug.

We were offered a discount on our next stay at the Sunborn which we found quite insulting and will obviously not be taking up.",1,2024,08,26
119,2 wonderful night's.,"Immaculate throughout, lovely big room complete with a great view. Excellent location for Excel centre,  Canary Warf. Good choice for breakfast, in room complimentary tea, coffee and water. Fresh flannels each day. Large comfortable bed with separate sofa.",5,2024,08,26
119,Great stay on fabulous Yacht xx,"Great stay for three nights over the bank holiday 
Rooms surprisingly large with seating area and balcony 
All areas feel well kept clean and luxurious 
Beds so big and comfy - tea coffee waters and robes and slippers provided 
Great service and all staff lovely in all areas 
Sundown bar and outside space lovely for a drink 
Ate in restaurant one evening - really lovely food - for the men perhaps not huge portions though but all was well presented and really tasty 
Breakfast good buffet style and all hot and cold options 
Breakfast 8-11 am which is good 
Good area with easy access cable car over to 02 and Greenwich 
We explored Greenwich and Camden areas while away and enjoyed as done main parts of London previously 
Loved our stay and would defo stay again visiting that area x",5,2024,08,26
119,Fantastic second stay ,"This was my Husbands and I second stay at the Sunborn and it did not dissapoint. Only minior issue was the bar took a long to get served drinks due to being over the business bank holiday weekend. 
Breakfast was lovely and highly recommend going before peak times as when we left there was a large queue. ",5,2024,08,26
119,Excellent afternoon tea experience,Thank you very much to George and Raj Darapunena for your excellent hospitality. We enjoyed our afternoon tea experience. We also appreciated the fact that you offered us hot drinks at the bar after our afternoon tea session had expired. You are both an asset to your team and we hope to return again soon.,5,2024,08,26
119,Fantastic stay in London,"An exceptional stay, the room, the food, the staff and the location are all amazing. If I could give it 11 out of 10 I would. There is nothing I would change about this trip. 
We stayed for 2 nights and the only thing I didn't enjoy was leaving, it was really handy for nipping into central London and just across from the 02 arena. 
I would love to visit again.",5,2024,08,23
119,One night only on the Sunborn …..,"We attended For The Love of Fantasy event at the Excel over the weekend and decided to treat ourselves to a night on the Sunborn, so the location was excellent.
The hotel is clean and impressive, the staff especially Kiran on reception could not have been more helpful.
Excellent food and cocktails.
We will definitely stay again.",5,2024,08,23
119,Excellent service,"Wow an amazing hotel in fabulous location.  We were going to O2 so used the cable car and DLR to travel. 
The room/suite we were given was incredible including bath tub and a huge balcony! Breakfast was beautifully cooked and we just wish we could have stayed longer as the bed was one of the comfiest I have ever slept on!",5,2024,08,23
119,Not that special at all,"Hotel is located in a rough area of London, so close to city airport that plains fly over every 3 minutes, creating a massive pollution. Executive suite that I booked was not how it was shown on the photos, it over-looked the other side of the boat. Room toilet stunk, obviously sewage problem. Could not switch off the aircon at night as I do not like sleeping with it on. Average food, disguising breakfast to which you had to queue and dinner at lands end - hugely over-priced!!! Only 1 good thing is that restaurant view is nice on a sunny day (that is if you don't stand near smokers), smoking should not be allowed, I got fumed more than once. Way too over-priced for what it is. Won't recommend.",2,2024,08,20
119,Great experience.,"Happy smiling staff and nothing is too much trouble. Decoration on board  is first class, food was great. We had afternoon tea and it was on par with the Ritz. We upgraded our room and it was well worth the extra giving us a sofa also a balcony with 2 chairs.",5,2024,08,19
119,"beautiful hotel, but…","my partner booked us a night at the sunborn as a birthday surpise for me. it’s a beautiful place to stay, room was immaculate, breakfast was lovely and all workers were very polite, the only reason i’ve rated it a 3/5 is because there was a huge party going on the night we stayed and he was not informed about this prior to booking, the party had reserved all the outside areas on the boat for the whole afternoon/ night as well as the restaurant so we was not allowed to go out there. although we did still enjoy our stay very much i feel as though he should’ve been told beforehand about that.",3,2024,08,19
119,Excellent stay — a pleasant experience,"Polite and friendly staff at both check in and check out. Thank you to Reshma who made our stay enjoyable.

Check in was easy and convenient. Room was spacious, comfortable, and clean. View was great — we had a balcony room overlooking the Thames.

We were based on the 2nd floor at the end of the yacht hotel.

Breakfast was ok and had a nice selection of food and drinks.

Overall a comfortable stay and would recommend.",5,2024,08,17
119,Afternoon Tea,Went for afternoon tea and it was excellent.  The staff are probably the friendliest and most helpful I have come across.  Even though my sister was over an hour late and no point were we made to feel as though we were a problem and because there was no booking we were able to stay until nearly 9.,5,2024,08,16
119,Amazing hotel,"Currently enjoying this beautiful hotel right now but me and my partner have never been so impressed by the service we have recieved today we both come from the hospitality industry and can see a happy working environment which is extremely rare these days we have been too some lovely hotels in London and been so let down by the lack of care for people that are spending there hard earned money. We are here for my partners birthday and it’s our first night with out our 4 kids in nearly every two years and we do not want this night to end. Thank you so much for giving us the best night we could have wished for. Great service, clean, well looked after and amazing decor in this hotel.",5,2024,08,15
119," Beautiful Setting but ...","The Sunborn is beautiful inside and out. The bedroom was spacious and very clean, the bed and pillows are wonderfully comfortable! The facilities within the room are adequate, including a kettle, coffee machine, iron, hair dryer, etc.

There was a gentleman on reception when we arrived to check in that was fantastic! So friendly and funny. There were others that were not as welcoming but still very pleasant. They were very accommodating with storing luggage before and post your stay.

I don't knock ratings normally but given the following, they should make it extremely clear before people book as it would have influenced our stay.

We were dockside. Had we have known that this would mean you got woken in the early hours by a port door banging (which sounds like a canon going off!!), we would definitely have not booked to stay dockside. The noise woke us with such a start. And then it continued on and off until we eventually dragged ourselves out of bed. 

Breakfast was lovely, the food was plentiful and very tasty. They would benefit from having a reshuffle of the hot food location though as it makes it really difficult to plate up; there is no room to put plates down and you have to lift large metal lids at the same time. Just a little rejig to give people some room, it would be really helpful.

We stayed for our anniversary and I had asked if there was just a little something that they would do; I had one person on email tell me packages and their complimentary option, then another person replied to my follow up email to say they don't do anything complimentary. 

We would happily stay there again BUT we need assurances that if we stayed on the Thames side, that there wouldn't be the same noises throughout the night.",3,2024,08,14
119,Great hotel that’s a bit different,"A great hotel that’s a bit different. 
Great location for the O2 and or ExCel centre. Very clean and quiet. Surprisingly spacious rooms with complimentary toiletries, hair dryer, coffee machine and even an ironing board and iron. (I believe that the balcony rooms have more…   like robes) Good choice of breakfast, well labelled for gluten free.  Staff very friendly and helpful.",5,2024,08,14
119,VERY GOOD BUT THEY NEED MORE STAFF,"Very nice experience. Obviously, a bit out of the City but the Elizabeth line gets your there pretty fast. Quick check and friendly check in - Alex was such a nice man on reception. Room was excellent. Breakfast was OK but could do with improving their bacon which had white fat all over it.
I would have given it 5 stars but the hotel is definitely short of staff. We went for a drink after 22.00 and the tables were a mess and service was very slow. The tables at breakfast were not cleared quickly enough either so there was a queue - its a pity as that was the only thing needing improvement.",4,2024,08,12
119,Spacious rooms on this stylish vessel,Great views of the dock from the bar terrace / deck. Spacious clean rooms with a very comfy bed. Located close to the Elizabeth line for easy access to soho and beyond. Minor issues...breakfast could be warmer and glasses in the bar could be cleared more quickly....otherwise highly recommend. ,5,2024,08,11
119,Unique London Hotel Accommodation,"We stayed for two nights aboard Sunborn.  We got a great rate with complimentary breakfast for just £129 per night through Booking.com.   Easily reached by car (multi-storey parking available in the nearby Novotel) or by tube (the Elizabeth Line and DLR service the nearby Custom House station), Sunborn is permanently moored at the docks just between the Excel Exhibition Hall and the Novotel.  

You enter by way of a dock-side elevator, which takes you up to the glitzy Reception area. Our check-in was efficient and we were allocated our spacious cabin on the deck below.  

On entry to our cabin, it was much larger than expected with good-quality teak wooden features, many inlaid with marquetry. There was a smallish shower-room / WC to the left and ample wardrobe space.  The cabin was divided into bedroom and sitting room areas, the latter equipped with a comfortable sofa, teak-wood display cabinets and large oval picture window,

The bed was very comfortable and we had two good night's sleep.  The cabin enjoys the benefit of a large flat screen TV (with usual freeview channels), efficient air-conditioning, iron, ironing board, hairdryer and small fridge.

The views from the bar and restaurant at the rear of the vessel (particularly at night) to the twinkling lights of Canary Wharf and the 02 presents a spectacular backdrop.

Bar meals are reasonably priced (and there are plenty of restaurants and convenience stores in the streets outside if you would like to dine on shore, or stock up your fridge).

Staff are very pleasant and helpful and the standard of housekeeping is immaculate throughout.

A quirky and unique alternative to hotels when staying in London",4,2024,08,11
119,Nothing special,"Pleasant but nothing special. 
We went for afternoon tea, and seeing we  had arrived 30 minutes early, we decided to have a drink in the bar.  It took over 30 minutes from start to finish to get our drinks, then have the audacity to charge us £4 for service!!  My drink was so sweetly sharp that I had to dilute it down with lemonade, as it was a mojito. 

Afternoon tea was pleasant, albeit they shunted most customers to the front of the ship, which was lovely for views but we were sitting on top of one another.  
Afternoon tea was served but they did not give you two of everything, so we requested them and alongside the tea, plus complimentary cocktail. 
After getting the missing items, they do not bother to check on you or indeed refresh your teas despite them stating they were refillable.  

Money spent on this afternoon tea does not warrant the quality or service, as you can definitely get better elsewhere but the views were glorious overlooking the Thames.",3,2024,08,10
119,Excellent stay,"Stayed for 3 nights while away for a break to London lovely location and easy access with Elizabeth line just a short walk not a lot about in my opinion and not as nice as near by Canary Wharf by the Sunborn itself is a wonderful hotel rooms are very spacious. We had a balcony that looked out shore side and could not of been happier with it, staff very  friendly and always cheerful, the only reason I have only gave a 4 star is breakfast lets it down it’s bit small and very busy which ever time we went and staff having to work hard to keep everything topped up apart from this the experience was lovely and makes a perfect night away for anyone wanting something a little different",4,2024,08,08
119,Birthday stay,"Have stayed on Sunborn London  a few times now , and also Xmas holidays on sunborn Gibraltar.
Arrived on Tues for a one night stay for my birthday, was greeted by Alex on reception. Extremely friendly man who upgraded our room to a suite for my birthday. The suite was out of this world . Have dinner in the restaurant which was first class . Can’t wait to return",5,2024,08,08
119,Feaces found on toothbrush!!!!,"Booked 2 rooms for 2 nights.
Dangerous place to stay be warned!!!!
Found feasces on a brand new out of the packet toothbrush.l after room was cleaned.
No toilet brushes provided in bathroom.  Obviously used by the cleaner to clean toilet and put back.  Reported incident to the front desk and was told they would be in touch within 2 days.
4 days later (this morning) I was told an internal investigation was carried out, and they apologised for the matter and was told by Sunborn manager that is the end of the matter.  Which to me is a joke.

That is not good enough as a response I’m afraid I will put the photos of the toothbrush and video I have all over these websites.  I will also be in touch with London hotel authorities to make a serious complaint.

Sunborn hotel customer service should be ashamed of themselves.  And whoever did this could cause serious harm.",1,2024,08,07
119,Super yacht - WOW 🥰,"What a beautiful way to enjoy afternoon tea, on a super yacht with great views. Great service and lovely bites of food. Duridice one of the manager’s, very kind  and informed us of the history of the hotel and different aspects, restaurants, upper deck etc.,",4,2024,08,07
119,5* for accommodation and friendly staff but 2* for food at dinner ,"Lovely beautiful yacht. It was a perfect end to our European driving tour. 

We stayed in a stunning riverside suite, comfy beds, a huge bathroom with a jacuzzi and sauna, and a free minibar with massive outdoor terraced area!! 

Evening meal was disappointing as tasteless, fish was watery, risotto was bland and desserts were unappetising. 

Staff, however, were attentive, super friendly, and very accommodating. Special acknowledgement to John and Kiran, who made my birthday stay very special. Thank you! Also to Abdul who was personable and kept the glasses topped out. 

Stunning staircase and lovely breakfast. Amazing bar deck views. 

",5,2024,08,03
119,City Break for a couple of Culture Vultures,"From the moment we arrived we felt well looked after. We had a lovely spacious room with private balcony and good views. Great base for exploring London, surprisingly quiet, and lovely to come back to after our days out. Staff friendly, food good. Would stay here again.",5,2024,08,01
119,Enjoy luxury on the water,"My wife and I celebrated our Pearl wedding anniversary by spending a night aboard this beautiful yacht.

There are over 100 rooms and we had one that faced the docks with a balcony which had a couple of chairs which you could sit back and relax.

Fridge included as well as dressing robes, iron, hairdryer.

Very clean although pillows were lumpy, but as there for just one night just went with it.

London City Airport is very near and planes will fly low in front of you. Yes there is noise but we loved watching them come in on their approach.

Staff very helpful and polite, cocktails were lovely and we had a pizza which was excellent. 

Didn't eat dinner in restaurant but breakfast was plentiful, full English, cereals, continental and fruit etc.

Use Uber if need a taxi as the one they use we were told is a premium service rate. 

Tip. If want to enjoy the cityscape at night get to the back of the boat early to get a good seat view",5,2024,07,31
119,Amazing stay on board the Sunborn yacht.,"I spent my 24th year anniversary on board and it was amazing, the staff were so friendly and welcoming the yacht was beautiful and clean. 
The food was delicious too. 
I would definitely recommend to others to enjoy the Sunborn experience. Xxx",5,2024,07,29
119,Beautiful venue but lacked attention to detail,"I booked a river view room for my husbands 50th birthday.  We had a lovely welcome at reception and were pleased with our room. It was a very good size although I would say that some of the built in furniture was showing some signs of wear. The views were spectacular. The bathroom did let the room down. It was very tired and whilst the room appeared spotlessly clean the bathroom felt a little grubby. Lack of attention to detail. There were several dark curly hairs of the bathroom floor and shelves which was a little off putting. When I got a clean towel out of the cupboard and opened it up several long black head hairs fell out onto the floor!!! It was all just a bit off putting.  The location is fab for the cable cars and excel. The bar is lovely to have a drink in the evening. Breakfast was a little disappointing. We were shown to a table but were given no direction. We had to ask another diner where they got their drinks from. The breakfast spread was adequate and of good quality but the covered service dishes at the breakfast buffet were a bit of a problem. Rather than a lift which lifts up as I’m accustomed to, you had to lift the entire lift off and the only place to put this was on top of the serving dish next to it which really slowed the line up. Everybody waiting was saying how silly it was.  On the whole we had a great time but the rooms are very expensive and for that price I would not expect the points that I’ve mentioned above.",3,2024,07,28
119,Fantastic stay at The Sunborn London.,"We had an amazing stay in the Sunborn London. The staff were so friendly and helpful. The room was absolutely beautiful and very spacious, and the bed was so comfy ! We spent a lovely evening at the bar sitting on the deck sipping wine with the stunning view of London lit up in the background. The breakfast was fantastic too. I would highly recommend anyone visiting London to stay at The Sunborn. The service is impeccable. We will certainly be back soon.",5,2024,07,25
119,If you are considering booking - do it!,"From start to finish, the Sunborn experience didn't disappoint. We were greeted by Maris at reception who made us feel so welcome with a very friendly face, and gave us ideas of where to visit around the area. Our room was also upgraded and the stay was very comfortable. The rooms were very clean and all the staff were so helpful. We will definitely be back!",5,2024,07,25
119,Loveboat:),We had a lovely night there and the staff could do enough for us.  They upgraded our room and even when we put dinner there gave my wife a little box of chocolates and wrote happy anniversary on the desserts. It’s the little things that help thank you,5,2024,07,21
119,"Timeless elegance onboard a stunning ship with welcoming staff, great views and spacious rooms","There is something special about this place. As soon as we clocked eyes on the ship, we got the 'wow' factor. Then there was the warm welcome at reception and in fact every member of staff we met at reception and the bar were charming. We had a riverview executive room with balcony. Spacious and clean. This isn't super, sleek luxury, but more like classic and elegant style. Great to have a sofa and also great to have a couple of chairs on the balcony (which we hadn't realised we would). Felt really at home. If you can stretch to riverview, do it. If you can stretch again to riverview with balcony, do it. You feel like you're on a cruise that's docked in port. Enjoyed watching the family of swans, the paddleboarders and the twinkling lights of the IFS cable car and Canary Wharf in the evening. Also enjoyed seeing the planes coming in and out of London City Airport nearby (they seem to stop and restart at a reasonable time so you can sleep). Do have  a drink at the bar at the back of the ship and enjoy the views towards Canary Wharf. Breakfast was basic but plentiful. We ate at the restaurant in the evening (burger and fish and chips) and this was very good. There are enough restaurants within a few minutes walking distance too, like Tapa Tapa if you like tapas.",5,2024,07,20
119,Brilliant service and a lovely hotel,"Honestly one of the best hotel experiences ever. Stayed with my mum as my graduation present and the stay could not have been better. Breakfast was superb, rooms very comfortable and overall just great atmosphere. The best part were the members of staff that made sure our stay was perfect. A very very special shout out to Reshma on reception as she was absolutely brilliant since check in until checkout, kept checking up and made sure we had everything we needed. We will definitely stay again when we come back to London.",5,2024,07,19
119,A great night's stay,"My wife and I had a great nights stay on the Sunborn London yacht. We were greeted by a very nice man called Alex, who instantly made us feel welcome, and kindly gave us an upgrade from a room with a window to a room with a balcony. Thank you Alex! Our room was spacious and very clean, as was the rest of the yacht. We didn't hear a thing during the evening and morning, which allowed us to have a decent nights sleep. The view from the rear of the yacht is very nice, and it's well worth having a drink/eating on the deck if a table is available. The breakfast was ok but would have been much nicer if it had been warmer. I'm sure the hot food items are hot when they are replenished, as this appeared to be done frequently. However, they were left uncovered, which doesn't help retain the heat. This is the only slight negative about our stay, and overall, we had a great night at Sunborn London. ",5,2024,07,17
119,Pleasant Experience,"We had a pleasant experience at this hotel. Very professional and helpful service by Lithuanian receptionist Neringa. Great location, clean rooms, tasty breakfast and exceptional service. If you looking for something different and most importantly to have a good rest in busy 
London, this hotel is highly recommended.",5,2024,07,17
119,Very joyful,"Wonderfull stay, good service, friendly employees, good food.
Nearby a Subway station which brings you to the inner centre of London.

So nice to see and speak employees like Neringa and Eurdice who have special attention to their guests.

All by all we enjoyed it very much.",4,2024,07,17
119,Birthday weekend,"Pleasant one night stay, thank you for the card and chocolates.  All staff very helpful ( thank you for helping out with my perfume bottle )   My only feedback is the overflow breakfast area could do with more ambience, a few plants etc ( so it feels less like a conference room ) ,Nice location to walk up to the bridge and then walk down to the cable car, followed by the Uber boat to Canary wharf.   Thank you for the gluten free toast and cream on the hot chocolate ☕",5,2024,07,15
119,"Night away at sunborne yacht, very specisl","Really enjoyed our night away at Sunborn. Bed and breakfast plus we ate dinner in the restaurant. Food was delicious, service great, staff all very friendly, helpful and professional. River view cabin was a must for us. Great view. Nice stroll to oilers bar on a boat and cable car over to O2. Enjoyed watching the planes landing at city airport. Watersports on river good to watch. Would recommend.",5,2024,07,14
119,Go for it!,"What a fantastic experience to stay on the boat with my son. 
So close to Public transport. 
Spotless clean.
Huge room.
Beautiful coffee machine in the room.
Amazing breakfast with lots to choose from. 
We will definitely come back and I would highly recommend it to everyone if you are on business,  sightseeing or if you never wanted to get off!
Thanks for a wonderful stay",5,2024,07,14

119,Very positive experience,"I  was upgraded to one of the Executive Dockview rooms with a balcony.
Very spacious, well maintained and plenty of storage should you need it.
Nice to have a fridge in the room and complimentary water.

Breakfast was tasty.

All staff were very helpful.

When I return to ExCel in the future, I would certainly book this hotel.",5,2024,07,08
119,Great food and drink,"Great venue, food and even better cocktails !!
Would recommend that side of it. Not an awful lot to do around you but you would expect that anyway due to its location. The Pineapple daiquiri is to die for. A real must. For a night of food and drinks !",5,2024,07,07
119,Excellent stay in this fabulous floating hotel.,"Stayed at this wonderful floating hotel from 1st July - 3rd July 2024 and from the minute we arrived our stay was perfect,  the reception was glamourous and staff helpful and polite, our room was fantastic, we did get room upgraded to include a balcony and Victoria dock view, it was a spacious room with the addition of a balcony,  it was clean and luxurious. The rooms are well soundproofed as we didn't hear anyone in other rooms or from the corridor and although we knew we were near London City Airport with the Balcony door closed you hardly noticed it. Breakfast was everything you could ask for, it was help yourself which also included picking your own table, we enjoyed views overlooking Canary Wharf. Location was great simply jump on the DLR or Elizabeth line which took us to the Tower of London and on our leaving day directly to Oxford street for shopping. Overall this was a great stay and way beyond our expectations. 5 star review from us and we hope to visit again.",5,2024,07,07
119,Sunburn yacht A*,"Excellent customer service A* 
Very clean and welcoming and service was extremely professional. Food was exceptional 

Would definitely return and recommend to anybody who’s looking for an experience 

02 arena just a 🚠 away

Close to street food and restaurants",5,2024,07,06
119,A touch of luxury in an amazing location!,"I honestly can’t recommend Sunborn enough! 

From the moment I checked in, nothing was too much and the staff were so friendly and genuinely welcoming.

The room was stunning, the bed super comfortable and breakfast was beautifully cooked.

If you want to experience superb luxury in an ideal location you absolutely must book in at Sunborn!!",5,2024,07,06
119,"Great stay, great food.",A wonderful experience. The room was excellent.  There are great views of the river from the bar and restaurant.  Lovely to watch the sun go down over London.  The highlight was the evening meal.  It was awesome and delicious.  I thoroughly recommend it.,5,2024,07,06
119,Excellent,"We had a fabulous stay on the Sunboun , The location is perfect . 
Room was lovely & clean
Breakfast was good . 
The staff & service was Excellent.
After a day out in london it was nice to come back late sit on the Bar balcony and see the views across the River all lite up . 
Definitely be back 
And would 💯 recommend for something a little different to a normal hotel .",5,2024,07,06
119,Terribly disappointing,"I purchased a birthday package as part of my stay, an offer sent by the Sunborn team prior to my stay. They indicated what was included along with the price. Upon entering the cabin, the birthday cake was missing. I assumed it would be delivered after we had been there a while but after 3 hours, nothing showed up. I raised this at reception and was challenged by a very unhelpful and unfriendly staff member who wasn’t able to take ownership and raised it to his manager. I was basically accused of lying about not receiving the birthday cake and was offered a partial refund. It took a long time to get an apology or birthday greeting out of the people working there. They act like they are doing you a favour by working there. 
There is no point staying here if you are expecting a high level of customer service. I would not recommend this place to anyone. I’ve never been made to feel so uncomfortable on my birthday before. Extremely disappointing.",1,2024,07,06
119,lovely spot to stay in London,"we booked an overnight stay for a wedding anniversary , the room was beautifully dressed by Euridice it made such a difference to feel like we were dealing with someone who cared . the reception guys were really welcoming especially Alex when we checked out , thanks guys for a lovely stay",4,2024,07,02
119,Afternoon Tea Treat,Had an afternoon tea on board which was lovely.  Staff couldn't do enough for you.  A real treat.  Food was great as was the cocktail.  You could even swap some sandwich fillings if you didn't want them.  Would definitely go back again if I visited London.,5,2024,07,01
119,Boat People ?,"This Yacht (I believe there is a Sister Partner moored in Gibraltar)..is somewhat pretentious and as you would expect..expensive.

We spent a cameo 3 nights on Bed and Breakfast..in a river view room (very well furnished and well cleaned daily) @ a cost of £950...
If you are at all interested in plane spotting.be aware that this venue is within touching distance of London City Airport...the planes come in and take off pretty low !

Breakfast choices were the usual.. adequate..
(for those people that like prosecco with their orange juice..you will be disappointed because there isn't any).

Reception staff came across as indifferent.
I was told to ""wait in the bar"" when I attempted to check in ..so 2 G&T's later and £22 later I decided to knock on the reception desk and ask where my room was ...
Initially they did not have a clue that I had a reserved booking 2 months prior..!
With an E mail confirmation signed off by the Duty Manager ..really ?
A lot of the dining area staff were ""Laissez Faire""..
Except Evelyn..at Breakfast table on our last morning who was simply polite/helpful and chatty and she is an asset to this business..
 
In conclusion..this is of course a business but The Management need to be more aware of the logistics of the layout of the dining area which is sometimes chaotic at busy times.

119,NOT luxurious,"After going round for approximately one hour to find a parking space we finally arrived at the hotel around 21.00 o clock . 
We learned that only one lift worked so there was some waiting time to get in . 
Our room wasn’t ready although the checkin time is 15.00 o clock. We didn’t mind that as we had the chance to get a drink and staff seemed very friendly .when the room was ready apparently we have been upgraded to a family room although it was just me and my husband.
Time to go to the room! 
Very disappointed, tiered , dated with a stuffy air . It isn’t anything luxurious about it really . Window can’t be open and the air can nearly function. 
This is our experience so far . We still haven’t been for breakfast, so we are hoping to be surprised with some nice food.",3,2024,06,30
119,Lovely stay. Dinner menu needs addressing,"Booked an overnight stay at Sunborn Hotel, room was very nice, beds and pillows comfy. 
Complimentary tea, coffee, water and cookies 🍪 
Shower gel, shampoo, shower caps, nice white towels 
Staff very accommodating, nothing too much trouble.
One big criticism! 
We had dinner booked in the restaurant, as I was not sure if other restaurants were in the vicinity. I was with my sister who is Celiac, on the menu there was only one dish that she could order which was risotto, and only one dessert, luckily enough she enjoyed both, but the point is she had no other choice! I think for the rates of this hotel dietary requirements should be better, they are probably missing out on restaurant bookings
Breakfast was fine as plenty of choice",4,2024,06,28
119,Lack of gluten free options,"Lovely place to stay overnight, however I  was really disappointed in the lack of gluten free options on the evening and breakfast menus, there was only 1 thing that I liked on the menu that was GF in the evening which was the risotto, in the morning there was no bread or pastry options for GF I could only have the eggs, bacon and beans everything else contained gluten 😢 
That was the only downfall for me, if I had realised that when booking I would have made sure I ate out in the evening! 
The staff was all very nice and the room was very comfortable.",4,2024,06,28
119,Excellent experience,"Sunborn London -ExCel nearby. DLR station, it is a 3-5 minute walk.

The location is great. Royal Victoria bridge, Excel cable car, restaurants all within 5 mins walk.

Room was lovely, big, clean, well furnished, comfy bed. Good cocktail’s in the bar.",5,2024,06,27
119,Thoroughly enjoyed the whole experience.,"From checking in to checking out I cannot fault this floating hotel. 
All staff were friendly and helpful. 
The cabin was spacious and well appointed. 
The food was very enjoyable. 
The view from my riverside balcony was brilliant, loved watching the cable cars in the distance and was fascinated by the planes flying over to land at the city airport.",5,2024,06,26
119,Super yacht stay in London,"Excellent experience for a 1 night stay in London.

To be on a luxury boat in the city was a novel concept and it was well worth it.

The location is great, with enough to see around the hotel to have a little wander. Royal Victoria bridge, Excel cable car, restaurants and Tesco all within 5 mins walk.

Room was lovely and would recommend balcony room overlooking the river. Clean, well furnished, comfy bed.

Breakfast was well stocked and good flavours - cooked breakfast could have been hotter however.",5,2024,06,23
119,Lovely hotel and great food,"The room was lovely, the staff were great and the food in the restaurant was excellent. Very handy for parking as the Excel car park is just a few minutes walk. Our only gripe was drinks from the bar. I went to the bar to order, and was told we will bring them over. On examining the bill later I discovered I had been charged 12.5% service charge for them to carry  the drinks to our table so beware of this.",4,2024,06,22
119,Five Star Prices - Three Star Service,"My wife and I certainly enjoyed our stay. 

However, I only scored the Sunborn 3 and I will explain why.

We are experienced and very friendly travellers. So we know how to navigate away from hotel weaknesses.

We are regular cruisers. So thought we would get a sort of cruise ship fix whilst waiting for our  next cruise next year.

Despite being on a boat. It felt more like a land hotel with river views. 

As a bed and breakfast hotel, I felt the price was fair and good value. 

However, soon as you start buying food and drink separately. Then you start getting into ultra luxury prices.

I did find a pint of the Sunborn beer for £7.50 quite reasonable for the type of venue.

The more I am charged, the more critical I am.

Dear Sunborn, if you are going to charge luxury hotel prices, you must have luxury hotel service.

The staff were not rude in way. But we're a similar standard to restaurants that charge half the price.

The cabins or rooms were very spacious and comfortable with a big sofa. I liked the card access to the lift and corridor. This made it feel very exclusive.

I will be returning to the Sunborn, but only for bed and breakfast. I will eat dinner elsewhere. As the food and service do not justify the cost.

I will however check in early and maybe enjoy a beer in the excellent lounge with cosy corners and great river views.",3,2024,06,22
119,Could not recommend anywhere better,"Beautiful hotel with amazing staff and a fabulous location and terrific money for value. The Sunborn was immaculate and impressive, food brilliant, check in and out like a breeze. Special thanks to the check in staff again on the afternoon of monday 17-06. Went the extra mile!",5,2024,06,19
119,Spoilt stay,"The Sunborn was recommended to us as an alternative vacation as docked on the Docklands London . 

Check in and greetings were excellent , the cabins were clean fresh and spacious . 

The restaurant was well managed and a great menu , although the paper menu itself did not do the chefs work justice . 

The cruncher came when we were overcharged for drinks in the bar and when subsequently brought this to the management attention the refund was ignored . Several calls to the Sunborn has fallen on deaf ears and has tainted our stay as a result . Will not be returning due to the £33 failing to be refunded",3,2024,06,18
119,Scam & very poor,"Refused to give a refund although I cancelled more than 24hrs before , as I was not feeling well and couldn’t attend. Money hungry didn’t even offer a reschedule . 0 stars of I could . Ignored booking.com request for refund as they want people to pay for a service that wasn’t received.",1,2024,06,18
119,Positives and negatives,"Positives and negative's
On arrival it’s beautiful and really stands out, the lift to get inside makes it feel very exclusive.  The entrance  is stunning and huge windows all round makes the most of the river.  The welcome was very luke warm and not welcoming at all,  I even reminded him it was my partners birthday to which he replied oh happy birthday.

I booked direct with the website as they said it was the best deal, I had booked upgraded room yet was told on arrival it did not include breakfast even though the other sites inc breakfast for the same price.  I did show them this but to no avail. I even emailed whilst here and again they refused even though they agreed it does say the best deal was through them.

The rooms are huge and with lovely riverside views, lounge area is an added bonus for space.  Coffee machine constantly overflows and 2 sockets didn’t work, the shower isn’t powerful.  

We went for drinks and the staff didn’t even know what tonics and sodas were available?  We were not made to feel welcome there at all.  We were going to eat upstairs but after the poor service we went to to the Crown Plaza over the road.  What a difference! The staff at the bar are incredible and so friendly! We had cocktails and drinks and then went the next day for food.   

It’s such a shame that my partners birthday wasn’t as expected but the service really needs to be looked at.  There are so many options where to stay now so this is even more importent then ever!

Please do not book direct and look around, the hotel itself is lovely but the service is not what it should be.",3,2024,06,17
119,"Not worth it, nice yacht, not good customer service","Not worth it - executive river view room

We stayed here in June for my partners bday.
On arrival everything seemed pleasant.

We had drinks and antipasti in the bar, nice but expensive. 
We didn’t fancy the menu and wanted to enjoy the room so we ordered from a local restaurant.
Here it begins - the room service number on the phone didn’t work.

I rang reception several times, tried to get some water and plates for food. Kept cutting me off and eventually told me to ‘get it myself we are busy’ 
Ok, fine. 
Went to the restaurant to stand there and ask for my plates, cutlery, water to carry up to my executive suite  in front of everyone 🤣

I stay in London often for work, I have had better service in budget hotels.

I just couldn’t believe the ‘get it yourself’ attitude.
The rooms are ok, dated, refurbishments haven’t been quite finished. Like the repairs to the wood don’t blend in.

The view was lovely, I just couldn’t believe the staff.
We’ve wanted to stay here for a long time and was very disappointed in the attitude of all the staff.
Unless you’re spending money they aren’t interested. Then again, we had spent £350+ £70 in the bar and still not interested. 

Wouldn’t return. Wouldn’t recommend.
There are lots of nicer options in London.",2,2024,06,15
119,Still owed money,"The hotel is nice and the location was good, however I booked through secret escapes and was told at check in that there had been an issue with the pre-payment for this, so I had to pay for our stay again at the hotel. I was advised to contact secret escapes about this, and since we have not heard from the hotel, I am still owed money.",2,2024,06,14
119,Lovely hotel shame about the beds,"Hotel was beautiful, staff very friendly we were welcomed by the man on reception who helped us with bus routes to the theatre, room was spotless and looked amazing, unfortunately the bed let it down, it was literally a hard divan base topped with a thin mattress topper it was like sleeping on a park bench !",3,2024,06,12
119,Eury and Maris,First class service. Thank you Maris and Eury E. You are the reason I always book with you. Always accomodating to my needs and always willing to go the extfa mile. Thanks for making me feel like a valued customer and taking the time to ensure customer happiness. Keep up the great work and positive attitude.,5,2024,06,10
119,Business Onboard The SunBorn,"We hosted an all-day business event in the Auditorium onboard the Sunborn Yacht Hotel London recently and it was a great success! The iconic venue provided a unique and appealing location for our guests with fantastic river views and an excellent room layout with a nautical design. Nicely positioned next to the ExCel centre too. Cyrina, Iren and Kalyan all deserve a special mention for providing an exceptional service prior to and throughout our event. Thank you!",5,2024,06,07
119,Ignored when complained /food not fresh and overpriced,"I went to the sunborn hotel for my 50th birthday. I was very excited and the initial welcome was lovely.
However, we went to the restaurant on board in the evening, I pre booked ahead and told them it was my birthday. On arrival all the best tables were already taken.  We ordered 3 mains and 3 drinks.  The food came out in five minutes which does not shout fresh to me. I ordered the lobster tagliatelle and the lobster chewy. The other dishes were fish and chicken which were not overwhelming.  The prices are very high and these dishes do not come with any sides such as vegetables. I wanted to complain on the evening but it was quiet and it was my birthday and didn’t want to make a fuss.  We left quickly and came off the boat to purchase drinks elsewhere.

The room.
It was lovely, however, my daughter who is 17 was on the pull out bed this was extremely uncomfortable with a very thin mattress and she didn’t sleep. It was also only catered for, for two people( two cups, two gowns, towels for two).

This experience did hinder my trip to London as this was meant to be a luxurious relaxing space. On returning home I got in touch with the sunborn by email and raised my concerns. Initially was offered a discount off a future stay (amount not stated).  However advised them that this was not something I wanted to return and this was a one off birthday celebration.  I requested as gesture of good will a refund on the meal.

 This is where the problems began. I was told the food and beverages manager would review and come back to me. This never happened after numerous emails I have been ignored. I also contacted the cooperate team who I also ignored my emails.
I am shocked at the unprofessionalism by being ignored this boat is classed as luxurious this I do not agree. 

I do not normally complain but being ignored after spending a lot of money to stay there you expect a first class experience.  I have stayed in much cheaper hotels which have provided better amenities. Yes it’s a stunning location, but their guests are not priority.  The food is not fresh and overpriced and the  is breakfast average. 

If you are going to stay there do not eat there.  spend your money at establishments where the food is fresh and not over priced.",1,2024,06,06
119,Sadly let down by lack of communication and understanding.,"Due to previous great stays at the Sunborn, we were really looking forward to celebrating my wife's birthday and another outstanding dining and overnight experience aboard the Sunborn. 
Unfortunately, on retiring after a lovely onboard meal, our sleep was interrupted with what sounded like some kind of electrical pump starting up and running at 10-15 minute intervals. I reported this at check-out the following morning and the Duty Manager was very apologetic, saying she would investigate the problem with the maintenance staff. 
As an apology she offered a preferential rate including an upgrade to an executive river view room with breakfast on our next stay. We agreed to the lovely gesture and arranged to return on a Monday evening in June. 
Another representative then emailed to offer the above room for a discounted current rate of £354.75 down to £249.00
I replied, pointing out that we could obtain the same room on the same date via the Expedia website for £247.00? 
I then received another email reducing the price to £209.00 as an apology.
I have just seen (05.06.24) that 'wowcher' are offering exactly the same room and breakfast for £229, so the apology actually works out at £20 for a disturbed nights sleep. No doubt if I leave it another couple of week the rate will be even lower.
Thank you for the offer Sunborn, but as in my earlier email to you, all I can say is thanks, but no thanks and to anybody reading this, I would just advise to stay away from Room 1038!",3,2024,06,05
119,Good vibes,"Excellent service, staff very polite, impressive accommodation. Good breakfast. Cool theme whether it’s a couple thing or a family break. Walking distance to the cable car that takes you to O2. Good value for money. Clean rooms with good character",5,2024,06,01
119,Great Family Experience,"We had a recent 1 night stay, whilst visiting family in London and loved it. We were checked in by Amara, who made us feel very welcome and went that extra mile. The room was really spacious and we all enjoyed breakfast. Great value for money and we will definitely stay again, hopefully when the sun is shining to enjoy the outside decks.",5,2024,05,30
119,Wonderful but overpriced bar and restaurant for the offerings,"Loved this yacht stay experience.  It’s really unique, smart, affordable and everywhere is clean!  The area is really nice by Excel exhibition centre with a smattering of coffee shops and restaurants on the river.  The hotel is just 5 mins walk from the Elizabeth line or DLR at Custom House stop.  The rooms we stayed in were with balcony and extra large beds - you can’t sit on the balcony though as it is not made of glass (no view when seated).  Overall, I was very happy with the room.  The restaurant however, especially cocktails and mains are very overpriced and the environment does not reflect the cost.  For example, the lamb I had was of average size and was £32 and the beef £42.  Also, in my opinion, at night the restaurant lacks ambience.  The lights should be dim, a tea light or lamp of some kind and a flower should be on the table and tablecloths should be provided.  A stapled photocopy of a menu is ridiculous - never seen this in a good restaurant.  With all of this in mind I’d stay again but wouldn’t drink or eat there unless prices are reduced and improvements are made.",4,2024,05,30
119,Lovely stay,"Lovely night away for our anniversary. Great service. Large comfortable room and a fabulous breakfast. What’s not to like?
If we were to be super picky the coffee machine in the room  didn’t seem to be working properly but it didn’t cause us any major  issues. Had to ask for decaff coffee at breakfast but again was not a huge problem. Would definately recommend for a night away somewhere a bit different.",5,2024,05,29

119,Wow... it was wonderful!,"From the moment we arrived and saw the Sunborn London yacht we knew we were in for a treat. Wow... it was wonderful!  Spotlessly clean and all the members of staff made us feel most welcome. Everyone was extremely polite and the attention to detail was second to none. We were in London for the ABBA Voyage concert which took us just 20 minutes to travel to and from (Excellent concert by the way!). The Land's End restaurant was fully booked when we arrived so we ate in the Sundown Bar and the Fish and Chips were cooked to perfection, a little expensive we thought, but nevertheless we were on a weekend break and cost was not of major importance. We took the 5 minute walk to the Cable Car and travelled to Greenwich and back on this. Certainly worth the trip and we consider the cost to be very reasonable. All in all we can't wait to return to the Sunborn London yacht and will use it in the future as our base for visits to London. Thank you to everyone on board who made our visit so enjoyable.",5,2024,05,29
119,Great stay for Comic Con,"Booked this far in advance of Comic Con which means we got a good deal. The hotel is stunning, the staff was really helpful as we needed to stash some purchases and luggage before check-in. Our room was so much better than expected, such a big room which was lovely and clean. Breakfast was included, I would give it a 4/5. Only comment on it was that the hot food was a bit awkward to get too with the lids and there was a bit of a queue. Our room air conditioning was poor as despite having it on full blast there was very minimal air coming out.

Overall 5/5 due to location, staff and room quality.

Thanks Sunborn :)",5,2024,05,28
119,A little gem with a  bit of luxury,"We stayed at the Sunborn hotel for one night in may and this is what we thought..
Negatives first … we felt the whole of the yacht was a little cold .
Positives …
I booked this hotel as we had tickets for the Chelsea flower show and thought it would be nice to stay over , I do like to try and find alternative accommodation and this did not disappoint. The Yatch is moored in the dicklands next to the EX Cel even so it was very quiet on board, there are a few shops around the corner and a few restaurants , it’s quite nicely situated on the doorstep of the capital.
On arrival the lift takes you to the 3rd floor where we were greeted by very welcoming staff, who checked us in and directed us to our room , the first opinion was oh wow very Titanic !! Down in the room it was very spacious with a large double bed ! One of the comfiest I have ever slept in , a sofa/sitting area and a view over looking the dock ! The room came with tv , coffee n tea making facilities, ironing board and iron hair dryer toiletries and towels all of a great quality .
The tv was on a swivel so we could watch it in the sitting area or in bed.
Shower room was basic but clean .
Room areas can only be reached using your key card which added that little bit more security something I liked.
We had booked in at the restaurant and had to re schedule as our 2.5 hour journey had taken us 5 ! But the hotel was very accommodating twice ! The restaurant was lovely and the food was beautiful service was exceptional , I expected small portions but was very surprised . I had the lobster linguine with a side salad and my partner the beef , with extra veg we couldn’t manage a starter nor a dessert .  I’ve seen comments about the price of the food but honestly you get what you pay for and personally think it was worth every penny.
After dinner we spend some time in the bar on the 3rd floor again it was table service and again everyone went out of their way to accommodate us. 
Would I recommend staying here I most certainly would .",5,2024,05,24
119,Unique docklands location,We had a fabulous stay at the hotel. All staff were friendly and attentive. We were celebrating ‘big’ birthdays and on arrival we had been given a room upgrade and chocolates in the rooms which made us feel special. All the facilities in the rooms and hotel were excellent. The bed was extremely comfy. Unfortunately we had bad weather but I can imagine it’s great to sit outside on deck for a drink on a sunny evening! It’s also fun to get the cable car across to the O2 from here.,5,2024,05,23
119,Absolutely Brilliant!!!!!,"What an amazing experience.

I can't speak highly enough about this hotel. The staff were lovel, really helpful and friendly. They went above and beyond to make the experience enjoyable.

Overall a great experience.",5,2024,05,21
119,FABULOUS!,Upon arrival we met Neringa to check us in. We were early but that was fine and she actually upgraded out room to a suite. We had a great stay in a top quality hotel. Looking forward to heading into the city to the theatre. Easy access points and the Food was amazing too!,5,2024,05,21
119,Amazing!,"Wz wznt on the 19th as we on our way to America and i wanted to celebrate wiffy birthday alone with her before we fly.

As we stepped into the building, John the manager after i introduced myself personally went to make sure the room is in top shape, and yes it was!

The staff members were polite and ready to help, yes no parking expect disable, but if you looking for a top place to stay, i give this 5 star plus, and thats me who has seen the best of hotels, frim Dubai, London, America etc.

John, this is to say a very big Thank you to you and your crew, you do amazing job, i will sure return, once again THANKS!!!",5,2024,05,20
119,The best as always,"We had the best weekend stay here as we always do.
 If you want a perfect night away don't look anywhere else. The staff here are always amazing. 
I have to give a special mention to Amara Fouade on Reception as he went above and beyond for us this stay. He is always a face we look forward to seeing as he is so friendly helpful and just a pleasure to see. 
A new recruit was Reshma who we can tell is going to be an amazing part of the team as it was her first day and she was so helpful and gave us such a warm welcome.
The rooms are amazing the food is amazing the beds are the most comfortable and I actually can't find anything wrong.  
The views from the boat are great, and it's such a perfect choice for the O2 for events or eating or Excel or just to be there in a perfect place. This is our 6th time and we will always chose this place as we know we will have the best time every time and will be looked after so well by the best team. X",5,2024,05,19
119,Simply just beautiful,"This hotel is just simply amazing I have been here more than 6 times and I can never get bored of it, if your like me and you enjoy being by the water and want quite time this is the place to go

First of all, it's so nice to keep coming back and seeing the same friendly staff

Out of all my great experiences coming to the sunborn
this was definitely the best one😁

on the 5th of May which was my birthday i made a last minute decision to book myself a room which i always get executive Riverview just for the fact that its a beautiful view and I love being by the water

while checking i had an upgrade the gentleman said to me if I like views then this room is for me
as I went into the room I was completely amazed

I just couldn't believe how beautiful the room was, and the night view was so amazing

I had such a good time especially the fact that it was my birthday, honestly this gentlemen made my birthday even more special 10/10 i felt well taken care of

My only regret I wished I had booked two days so I could have enjoyed the room even more😁

The staff are great
rooms are clean
breakfast is nice
Location is amazing win win all round

Rooms are ....well try for yourself 😁",5,2024,05,18
119,A room with a view,"From the moment we arrived to the time we left our stay was faultless! The location in Royal Victoria Dock is so convenient for a great part of London that we often forget. On board our room was spacious, clean and with the small balcony we had excellent views. As for the staff, they were all without exception, charming, helpful, attentive and all this with a smile on their face. On arrival we were greeted by Narina, who epitomized the care and attention to detail that all the staff afforded us throughout here stay.",5,2024,05,16
119,Recommended for The O2 and a change from the norm.,"I can thoroughly recommend this hotel for anyone visiting The O2 needing overnight accommodation and looking for a change from the norm. The accommodation is excellent and the staff are helpful and friendly.

Transport links are very good being only a short walk from Custom House station for DLR and Elizabeth Line, not to mention the cable car ride over to The O2. 

Food is good “on board” but there are also interesting options nearby. We sampled the food on the bar menu but didn’t eat in the restaurant other than the very good buffet breakfast. 

Would certainly stay again.",5,2024,05,14
119,My room,The room was very hot didn’t have air conditioning we asked for a fan for the room and they gave us one which hardly blew pointless having it they changed our room which didn’t make it any better some of the tv channels stopped working or didn’t work at all and had trouble getting room service for drinks for what I payed for one night I wouldn’t pay that again,1,2024,05,12
119,Business trip.,"Ideally located for the XL Centre. 
Comfortable and helpful staff 
Spacious rooms with tea and coffee making facilities. 
Rooms serviced daily. 
Not much else around there restaurant wise and hotel menu limited. 
Stayed for 4 nights and would recommend and stop again.",5,2024,05,12
119,Good staff make a difference,"Overall excellent stay the uniqueness is a definate plus factor. But what prompted this review ( from someone who normally cannot be bothered ) was the genuine friendlieness, and pleasant helpfull attitude from Hadija - restaurant and Alex front desk.  They both were outstanding so thank you to both.",5,2024,05,12
119,"Overall, a really enjoyable stay... thanks to John!","First things first: the breakfast was nothing to write home about, and the rooms were clean, convenient, if not a little dated. However, we had a great experience here, and it was dependent on two things: the weather and the room. The clear and sunny weather meant beautiful views that enhanced our experience. As for the room: when we first arrived, it seemed that, upon seeing us, two members of staff contrived to put us in the worst room possible - at eye-level with the dock, and right next to the gangway, meaning our view would've consisted mostly of concrete and people's legs as they traipsed on and off the yacht. Now, I won't get into why I believe putting us in this room was ""a contrivance"", however, upon seeing the room, we immediately went back to reception and asked the original staff members to switch our rooms. This is where we must give huge praise and thanks to John, another member of staff, who intervened by calling us over and arranging a much, *much* nicer room for us to stay in, and he did so cheerily. Thank you, John! Because of that we truly had a fantastic time here - a one-off, as we likely won't go back, but a lovely time nonetheless!",4,2024,05,09
119,Enjoyable,"This place is pleasant, there is the wow factor when you first walk in and I would stay again, it’s so peaceful, only gripe was the bed, I didn’t really sleep, the pillows felt so so lumpy it was difficult to get in a good position but it was nice to visit somewhere a little different and it’s a great location",4,2024,05,05
119,Poor,"Very disappointed.
Booked 2 nights but after last night we are going home . 
The pictures on the web site are not what we have experienced. If you’re looking for a special stay on a beautiful yacht then don’t stay here . 
Only 1 lift for entrance to hotel and all levels as other is broken. 
1 beer and large white wine £24.
No food available after 7 minutes to 10pm . 
Bed hard and uncomfortable. 
Room not clean in the galley. 
Bathroom is tiny. Shower is pathetic. 
Like I say we are looking around the Excel today then off home . I can’t stay another night here .",1,2024,05,05
119,Special hotel.,"This Yatch/ hotel is stunning. A Good location,  excellent service at reception on arrival. Beautiful spacious room with high end coffee and  tea. The room was remarkably quiet too.The breakfast was made even more special with the welcome from Bertrand and other staff members. So unusual to encounter staff that clearly like their job.
Can't wait to return!",5,2024,04,30
119,Fabulous Hotel,"Fabulous hotel. Second time we have stayed and it lived up to the same  impeccable  level of service and cleanliness. Had a river view standard room. It was large comfortable and very clean. Breakfast was great, good quality and variety.",5,2024,04,29
119,Had another amazing stay here,"Had an amazing 3rd time stay at this hotel. Our suite was wonderful with an amazing view, sauna and spa bath. We had dinner there. I would recommend booking a table in order to get a river view - if that is actually possible. Can’t wait to go again.",5,2024,04,28
119,Sunborn & “Take That” Superb!,"We stayed for the night at Sunborn London, we also had  a delicious afternoon tea.  
It was a convenient location for our night at the O2 with Take That & Olly (15 minutes away on the cable cars) .. so pleased we did the room Executive Water view was amazing, beautiful room with fabulous views. The staff at the Reception were very welcoming & in the restaurant & bar all staff was so friendly, service with a  smile from all, nothing was too much trouble.  Thank you Sunborn London, we will see  you again soon.  Bridget",5,2024,04,27
119,Unique London Stay,"We had a lovely stay onboard the Sunborn Yacht Hotel.  River view cabin with a balcony, fantastic views over the dock to the O2 and the cable car. Cocktails sat outside of the Sundown Bar, then an afternoon tea. A little bit of laid back luxury with helpful friendly staff.",5,2024,04,27
119,An amazing experience!,"What an amazing stay we have had at the Sunborn Yacht Hotel in April. We stayed on a Thursday night. We booked an overnight experience with a spacious executive riverside room and private balcony, 3 course dinner with a glass of prosecco each and full breakfast in the morning. We arrived about 11am so earlier than check in time at 3pm. The Reception staff were very welcoming and accommodating and a top floor executive room was available so didn't need to wait. We loved our view overlooking the river, O2 Arena and Canary Wharf. You can also see London City airport close by. The hotel is next to the ExCel Centre and the Custom House for ExCeL DLR station is only a short 5 minute walk away. 

We had dinner at 7pm and had a pick of tables so chose by the window overlooking Canary Wharf. So picturesque at sunset. Great choice of food on the menu and we couldn't fault it. It was 5* dining! Finishing off the night with some cocktails in the bar; a chilled atmosphere and just what we wanted.

We found the bed to be very comfortable and the room comes with air conditioning if needed. The lovely added extras of a Lavazza coffee machine, bathrobes and slippers were a nice touch.

We went for breakfast early at 7am when it opened and again had a table by the window. Great selection of hot and cold breakfast and freshly made. 

Overall, we had a wonderful time at the Sunborn Yacht Hotel and won't hesitate to stay here again.",5,2024,04,26
119,"Lovely afternoon tea, friendly staff","Had a lovely afternoon tea today. Arrived very early for booking, however, staff were welcoming, very friendly and attentive. Food was lovely, very fresh, a good selection and well presented. I would recommend, and will certainly go again.",5,2024,04,15
119,Recommended,"This hotel is an all round fabulous experience. The location is so convenient to Excel, Canary Wharf, and DLR. Inside the hotel is immaculate. The reception staff are friendly  and super efficient. Our executive room with balcony was pristine, clean and welcoming. The bed was so comfy, with beautiful pillows. The bartenders within the yacht establishment are so attentive and very friendly, our service was excellent. Breakfast in the morning is a definite recommendation, the buffet style is always being filled and again the staff work hard to seat people to their preference. We had the best time at the Sunborn Yacht Hotel, planning to book again soon.",5,2024,04,15
119,Relaxing on the river!,"Visited as a birthday treat. 
Nice comfortable hotel with lovely river views. 
Beds are comfortable and the cabins have all that you need. 
The  dining room lacks some atmosphere but the  bar and lounge are relaxed and comfy. 
Food is nice but a little overpriced.",4,2024,04,15
119,Our short stay,"This is a fabulous static yacht hotel at Royal Victoria Docks. The staff are brilliant, very helpful and always smiling. It.is exceptionally clean through out. Our Executive balcony cabin, overlooking the river was fantastic. Again, this was beautifully clean. It is situated next to the Excel. It is a short walk from the Elizabeth Line Custom House station. It is a short 5/10 minute walk to the IFSCloud cable car. We took this so we could go and see the O2, again only a short walk from the cable car. There are plenty of eateries, also within walking distance of the Sunborn Yacht Hotel. 

Our negatives were that although the breakfast buffet selection was plentiful, the plates were cold and by the time you had queued along the line and got to your table the food was luke warm, even cold.

The meal we had in the Landsend Restuarant, was, we thought, over priced for what you had. It was served very quickly after we had placed our order, which says to me, personally, that it was not cooked to order and could even have been pre cooked and then heated in a microwave.

Would we stay again, yes, but we would eat out at the many restaurants that I close by.",4,2024,04,12
119,This Place is The Pits,"The Room was freezing - Went to turn the radiator up and the valve fell off.
The bed was the worst bed i have ever slept in - Mattress as Thin as a piece of Paper.

Went to bar on arrival - Service rubbish - Carpet Filthy.

Had Booked afternoon Tea - Worst sandwiches & cakes - All stale and the  cheapest ingredients you could imagine .
The managers personal hygiene was poor - BO !!!!

Evening Meal was Booked - Cancelled due to experience with the afternoon tea.

Breakfast - Had a look what was on offer - Complete Shambles .
Lifted the hot plate with Scrambled Eggs - Full Of Beans On Top
Left & went for breakfast at the hotel next door.

I spoke with guest relations when checking out and they said they could come back to me - They have not.
I have sent four emails not even a reply .

My advise is avoid at all cost - The Pits",1,2024,04,11
119,Cheeky little break for us,"Myself and my partner stayed here for one night and it felt longer. The staff were very friendly from the moment we arrived the room was amazing very big warm comfy the view from our little balcony were great.
We had booked at the restaurant on board and again the staff made you feel welcome nothing was a problem for them The food was delicious and tasty and nice portions The views again are amazing of the area from the restaurant seating area.All in all well worth the experience would definitely recommend it and book again.",5,2024,04,09
119,Dated & has lost its charm,"I treated my partner to an overnight stay at the Sunborn. I stayed here once 10 years ago and surprisingly 10 years later the amenities are still the same. The decor is very dated and the reception staff rude -  minus the lady with short hair, she was every bit the professional and kind - as we're the gentlemen at the restaurant upstairs. On check-in, I explained to the person at reception that we have afternoon tea booked for 12:30 so could they allow for a later check out - instead of 11am, could we check out at 12 given we'd spent MORE money on the yacht, having the afternoon tea. The woman said we'd have to pay extra and simply wouldn't hear it - I thought was very unnecessary and could have been allowed, it would have gone a long way. As would have the fact when I complained the bathroom sink was leaking, she literally said to me, ""you're only staying one night, it's fine"". The lift was also broken and so people were having to haul prams and luggage up x3 flights of stairs - at the very least, offer a complimentary drink to apologise for the inconvenience. All that aside and for the staff members who were lovely, it was an alright stay. Doubt I'll be returning again however. ",3,2024,04,09
119,All in all beautiful,"My daughter treated me to a wonderful meal for my 60th birthday on The Sunborn Yacht. Wonderful, service, wonderful meal and Beautiful  place and scenery.

The staff were professional, friendly and efficient. I recommend  if you are looking for a pleasant enjoyable time.",5,2024,04,06
119,What an excellent piece of hospitality!,"The best experience we have ever had! The room, the arrival/departure were great but what led us to surely enjoy our time there was the delicious dishes the restaurant has to offer, along with the amazing service. Perfection!

P.s. Kudos to Mr. Eddie for providing the best overall experience and Mr. George for being so pleasant and professional simultaneously while having dinner. Worth every penny!",5,2024,04,03
119,Love rooms,"Stayed overnight Easter weekend hotel was busy room was lovely and clean, the bar area was fairly busy but coffee extremely pricy 2x cappuccinos was over £10 with there 12% service charge would not have so much minded if the cappuccinos were good but they were not. Breakfast was very good with a great selection on the buffet tables. Would stay again but would avoid the bar area as there are lovely bars just a very short walk away",4,2024,04,02
119,Lovely night away,"What a beautiful place to stay 

 rooms are big and spacious 
Spotless clean 
and bed was comfortable 

we had breakfast next morning and there was lots to choose from and was tasty 

Staff are friendly and welcoming 

Good location 

Only down fall is no parking  and the price in the bar was a bit on the expensive side 

Overall good experience and will return in the future",5,2024,03,31
119,"Nice hotel, would return.",Loved how this hotel is a yacht. Very friendly staff who upgraded our room for my sons birthday. It is within walking distance to the train. The buffet breakfast was lovely. The room was very clean and spacious. Beds were comfy. The bathroom has underfloor heating which was nice. Nice views from our balcony.,5,2024,03,30
119,My new favourite hotel in London!,"Another wonderful stay with the warmest of welcomes and outstanding service and care from each and every member of staff. Perfect for a solo traveller! The Elizabeth Line and Uber make it a fantastic location from which to explore London, see lots of shows and then return to the peace, quiet and comfort and the friendliest welcome which awaits you here. Thank-you all so much and looking forward to my next trip already!Xx",5,2024,03,29
119,Very very hit and more miss!! Such a shame! waste of money,"i was really looking forward to giving this birthday present to my best friend of afternoon tea and cocktails on a yacht.  i got to the restaurant, and the restaurant manager, who was write in front of me didn't smile or say hello, just waved to a colleague to take me to my table.   The food was lovely, as was the cocktail, but half way through, a server started to hoover, all right around our table, and other tables.  it was so loud that we couldn't hear ourselves, and there was no apology from her.  when another table  loudly complained that if she had wanted to hear hoovering all afternoon, she could have stayed at home, we got up and walked away and left our cocktails as we couldn't hear ourselves speak. i went to the restaurant manager and told him, and firstly he just plainly ignored me, and when i told him a second time, he just said, it is what it is, there is no solution, i either piss off the afternoon tea visitors or i piss of the diners.. and then then just left. such a disappointment for me and my friend.  total waste of money",1,2024,03,29
119,Amazing stay!,"Wonderful relaxing stay, we were kindly upgraded to an executive suite with a river view (thank you Ronnie!). Super comfortable bed, spacious clean room. Breakfast was delicious, great selection, sat looking out across the river. Would highly recommend. Easy fast connections into London (Elizabeth line).",5,2024,03,27
119,Great novelty hotel,"Seemingly unchanged from its cruise time this hotel features cabins, staircases and chandeliers. The rooms are large and the beds are comfortable. The buffet breakfast never seems to run out of anything and is nice and hot. The staff are polite and friendly. I was only there one night but felt it was good value for money and I will definitely use it again when I’m in the area.",5,2024,03,26
119,Poor,"Had afternoon tea and overnight stay on the yacht. Down side , afternoon tea, ate sandwiches before even brought drinks over ( ordered same time as sat down) then told o you had them ! Well no we havnt Then we got our tea.  After we ate we were asked to pay, but it is included in stay, to which they queried. That upset me as birthday treat for daughter  
The room was ok the bed being what looked like a king size camp bed with a very thin mattress on top.  Dreadful sleep. The waiter staff in the sundown bar just as poor. Said will come over to take drink order, but didn’t , had to ask. After first drink we were tired of waiting when we said we shall order again so left.  Think carefully before you spend loads on this yacht hotel. Poor service as should of been made aware regards who has paid and staying etc",2,2024,03,26
119,Great stay. Ideal for Greenwich and London,"My SatNav got us straight to the barrier and we could park within 50 yards of the entrance as I am a blue badge holder.
Very friendly and efficient staff but should have better knowledge of ULEZ as I didn’t know whether to pay or not
Very helpful man on reception who referred to me by name throughout.
Spacious comfortable room, but heating a bit hard to figure out.
Excellent breakfast and plenty of it.
Great bar with a fantastic view but the drinks a little pricey.
Would highly recommend and it’s only 30 minutes from London so will stay here again next time in town as the rates are comparable with a much less luxurious place in the centre",5,2024,03,25
119,Excellent,"Only stayed for 1 night bed & breakfast, room was really nice and cosy, clean.
Staff were very pleasant and friendly.  Drinks were not that expensive for London. Breakfast was really good, enough to choose from, got and cold. Definitely would stay again",5,2024,03,24
119,Absolutely Brilliant,"Outstanding service,  gorgeous food and just such a good experience all round,  would highly recommend and will definitely be returning. Disability access really good.  Room was spectacular with stunning views and the staff were nothing but spectacular",5,2024,03,21
119,Magical experience,"A truly magical experience.
The bed was really comfortable and spacious. Shower very efficient.
Balcony with fabulous views along the waterway towards London.
Easy access to Excel and Elizabeth line to anywhere around London and Heathrow",5,2024,03,18
119,Perfect couples day,"Great 5* experience for me and my boyfriend. Room very comfortable, great room service menu. The burger we had for our dinner in our room was delicious and filling plus the dark chocolate Delice.  Next morning we had buffet breakfast which was included with our stay that was very nice too. We also had issue with the app  but the workers at the reception were very helpfull and offered us great customer service.",5,2024,03,17
119,Slobs,"Had a lovely night on this yacht and a ride on a cable car. The floating hotel is lovely what I'd call posh, staff, room everything was lovely.  What left a lot to be desired was the scruffy guests wearing pyjamas into breakfast and dirty unwashed slobs.  The idea was smart casual seems some English people have lost the idea of smart! It's insulting to the immaculate staff.  Ignore the slobs and it was amazing, Maybe charge a bit more ? The dinner was lovely thank you",5,2024,03,17
119,Experiencing Afternoon Tea,"I've eagerly arranged for a delightful afternoon tea experience at the prestigious Sunborn Yacht Hotel, scheduled for the day following Mother's Day. Envisioning a charming and serene atmosphere befitting such an elegant venue, we excitedly stepped into the Lands End restaurant. However, to our dismay, our senses were immediately assailed by a pervasive and disagreeable odor. In the realm of fine dining, one typically expects to be greeted by enticing aromas that enhance the dining experience. Yet, regrettably, the scent wafting through the air resembled that of unpleasant body odor.

Despite this olfactory setback, I must commend the outstanding quality of the tea and food served during our visit. The exceptional flavors and presentation truly elevated our experience, managing to somewhat mitigate the initial disappointment caused by the unwelcome scent. Nevertheless, I couldn't help but feel a tinge of disappointment that such an otherwise lovely dining experience was marred by this unexpected olfactory intrusion.",3,2024,03,14
119,Comfortable stay.Very clean and polite staff.,"Very convenient and comfortable.
Staff were knowledgeable and polite.
Restaurant and bar food good quality.
Accessible to different areas Canary Wharf and London Excel.
Parking next door at Novotel very secure.River view room beautiful at night.",4,2024,03,13
119,An experience to remember,"This staycation was indescribably one of the best I have had in a long time. I booked a 2 night stay at the yacht hotel for my partners birthday and I did not regret it. The stay was nothing but luxury from the room to the dinning areas and more. Staff was quite accommodating and friendly. A special thanks you to Sonia who was a lovely breakfast host and Kiran, who works on the reception desk, and was very approachable and helpful in all aspects. I am very much looking forward to staying here again. Oh and breakfast was great. Breakfast included pescatarian and vegetarian options. Location wise you couldn't fault it.",5,2024,03,13
119,Great stay,"Thoroughly enjoyed our stay, the rooms were very clean, breakfast was really nice and the location was great. Brilliant view and lovely to be on a yacht. Staff were very friendly. Check in and out extremely efficient. Will definitely return to the Sunborn. Thank you",5,2024,03,13
119,"Sunborn Hotel London, Amazing!!","Absolutely fantastic, could not speak any more highly of this hotel. The staff were very friendly and  courteous. the room was fantastic. the view of the docks was amazing. 
We loved staying here and would definitely stay here again.
Breakfast was amazing!!
5 stars from us.",5,2024,03,12
119,The Icing On The Cake,"We were part of coach trip going to see ABBA Voyage, which everyone agreed was was amazing.  Whilst in the area my wife and I went on the IFS Cloud Cable Car, which gave a great view of that part of London.  The icing on the cake for us and many others in our party was stopping on the Sunborn London Yacht.  We did pay extra for a room upgrade, we were told by others that all the rooms were of a high standard.  We thought it was an amazing place to stay, if only for one night.   We had two meals whilst there, which we thoroughly enjoyed.  Breakfast was also very enjoyable with a large choice. 
 Credit to all staff who were extremely friendly and helpful.  We will recommend this floating hotel to all our friends and we hope to come back in the future.",5,2024,03,11
119,Yacht experience,"The hotel was nice, clean and cozy. 
Staff extremely friendly and helpful.
Afternoon tea is pricey, but I feel I got good value for money (not with vouchers) I found the sofa bed in the room, uncomfortable (but the ambience helped me to sleep)my companions  slept well in the  king size bed. Good location for shops and local restaurants, cable car and excel. 
Overall I would stay again for a short break.",4,2024,03,07
119,Awesome hotel!,"Great hotel with a great view! The ship is clean, beautiful, and friendly staff. My room had a great view, was clean and fresh. Bar has great martinis! I was here for a work trade show at Excel and it was literally a 60 second walk to the entrance.  The train station is also extremely close, and easy walk with my suitcase. I highly recommend to stay here.",5,2024,03,06
119,Fantastic hotel,"Lovely floating hotel. Superb room with great facilities. Nice bar area with great service. 
Buffet Breakfast was nice with a good choice. 
Fantastic location especially if you’re going to an event at the O2. 
We would definitely return when in the area.",5,2024,03,03
119,Good but could have been better,"Shame we didn’t meet the gentleman Ronnie as our customer service wasn’t so great. Upon check in the gentlemen just said have you checked in online, which I replied yes so he just wanted a signature, no pre payment or anything for room service no information nothing I had to google everything. The lady at check out this morning was lovely but then on luggage collection nothing no thanks for staying safe journey which to me is all part of a good customer service. The rooms are also extremely hot you cannot operate your own temp so we had the balcony doors open all night and probably wouldn’t go back for those two reasons, However for the positives the yacht is beautiful and very unique. The rooms are decorated perfectly . The staircase from reception to the restaurant is beautiful and welcoming. The location is a little out of the way but the DLR and tube connections make it easy to travel around London taking in the sights. Enjoyed the stay but could have been better. M",4,2024,03,03
119,Unique Concept-Recommend,"Very pleasant stay. Clean , spacious and comfortable rooms. Nice breakfast with great choices. Friendly and helpful staff.

Unique hotel concept. Hotel very well maintained. Close to central london but still far away to relax and enjoy the tranquillity.

Close to Custom House Underground/DLR station, Elizabeth Line-15 mins to Tottenham Court Rod Station.  Recommend the cable car and visit to the O2. 

Worth visiting Sunborn London.",5,2024,03,01
119,Just amazing!,"The rooms were amazing and the staff even more so.
They were so helpful and went above and beyond. I am badly claustrophobic and am unable to use a lift. Each time I needed to leave or enter the yacht a member of staff was always happy to open up the emergency exit door for me, and always with a smile. 
We can’t wait to stay on the yacht in future. I would highly recommend!",5,2024,02,28
119,"Brilliant venue, great  food and fabulous views of Docklandslands","Did this on a wowcher deal and it is a brilliant experience having dinner on a Sunday evening. We got a table right near the window so had a fab view of Canary wharf and Docklands.
The staff are really good and food was thoroughly enjoyable as you would expect. I would recommend this place.",5,2024,02,26
119,Some good & some not good.,"Firstly the good. We have stayed here before & also eaten dinner here before so knew what to expect. The yacht is lovely & the rooms spacious and comfortable. Breakfast was all fine although definitely needs another coffee machine & nicer cups. What wasn't so good was the rate we were charged. The website states best price guaranteed which is not actually the case. I booked direct a few weeks in advance, on checking the rates on the day before our reservation it was £30 less than my booking. On messaging the hotel at 4pm I was told it was too late to change me on to that cheaper rate, I needed to do it by 2pm, really ! Other big gripe was the bar/prices. We ordered two malibu & cokes, when we came to pay it was over £32. It stated doubles on the receipt, we hadn't asked for doubles nor did the bar person check with us whether we wanted doubles & it certainly didn't seem a double that we got, small glass with only a small amount in it. Naughty, naughty! So £50 out of pocket overall which put a mar on what was meant to be a special evening away.",3,2024,02,26
119,A pleasant surprise...,"This waa a very nice surprise indeed actually.
Never even knew this place existed. A very quiet location with good views and only a few minutes walk from the Excel Centre and the cable car to take you to the O2 side of Thames.
The novelty of it being as a yacht was a nice change.
Very friendly and customer- orientated staff, or Crew Members as they like to be known.
Want to take this opportunity to give a big shout - out to crew member Ronnie who was exceptional in going above and beyond in his customer service.!
Wonderful spacious room with all the amenities you would expect..and a TV I could actually hear!
Nice and clean and bright with a good view from its balcony.
An amazing breakfast in the morning , in an uncrowded restaurant, finished off the stay perfectly.
Highly recommended.
Adam 😁😛",5,2024,02,22
119,Fabulous ,"My husband took me here as a surprise for my birthday and wow it certainly didn't disappoint, wonderful beds, very clean cabins, amazing views and the best breakfast we have ever had! The staff was welcoming and friendly and check-in was smooth, we will stay again without a doubt ",4,2024,02,20
119,Excellent Stay,"What a Beautiful Yacht to stay on. 
Welcomed by Ronnie on reception he was so welcoming and professional. We got an executive river view room. Amazing clean spacious perfect room comfy bed too slept like a log. 
We had breakfast it was delicious extremely filling and everything you could think of. 
We will definitely be back. 
Thank you for an amazing experience.",5,2024,02,20
119,A great night’s sleep and a great location,"We had a lovely stay at the Sunborn. The location is great. We got the tube into town easily, cable cars to the O2 and even an Über boat just a short walk away. Our room was lovely. We had an executive room with a balcony. The balcony was tiny and I wish we’d asked for a river view but it was fine. The bed was incredibly comfortable and the hotel was lovely and quiet even though it was full. The staff were friendly and helpful. 
My only gripe would be that the cooked breakfast was lukewarm but that was far outweighed by everything else. I would definitely stay here again.",5,2024,02,20
119,Atrocious experience and after care,"18th feb - 3:28am
I’m currently staying in room 2012 it’s 3:30 and me and my partner are both wide awake after hearing a man and a woman have a physical fight, it’s gone silent now can you confirm that it’s been dealt with. I’m absolutely horrified to have heard this going on it’s completely ruined our evening

18th feb - 3:53am
It’s started again, you need to send someone over to tell them or call the police it sounds like it could be next door but the rooms are all so close together

18th feb -  3:57am
We are currently in 2012 and have been woken by a physical fight happening, it’s kicking off again someone needs to sort please or call the police it’s completely ruined our night I’m horrified it sounds like a man beating a woman

I then had a phone call to the room from reception - I was told someone would go check the room I wasn’t happy that they called as I didn’t want next door to know I had involvement.

I then had another phone call from the room to say everything’s fine they said the people in the room said nothing was happening, I was asked to go to reception. I was told the man wouldn’t come out and that it wouldn’t carry on I wasn’t happy because I don’t want to look like I’m involved for them to turn on me I was frightened our whole room was shaking from his banging and at one point I thought the lady had been killed. It was the most horrific thing I have ever had to endure and I had actually paid to be there

The hotel staff handled it extremely bad they are making me feel like a scrounger when I feel I’m due compensation really of a refund or complimentary stay and they are trying to coheres more money from me saying pay again and we will give you a heavily discounted upgrade… I shouldn’t have to pay a penny more

I came all the way from Warwickshire our train journey alone cost £200!!!! The staff are undertrained and rude and are refusing to escalate my complaint saying that’s all I’m going to get… I’m absolutely fuming about the whole experience

I want someone to contact me immediately to resolve please

Sunborn need to take accountability of the way I was treated… and the trauma me and my partner went through I don’t pay to listen to a women get physically assaulted when I can’t do anything to stop it. The police interviewed the couple the day after so they wasn't even. Removed from the ship and when I asked if the lady was ok sunborn said they think so?!!! It’s really bad after care",1,2024,02,19
119,Memorable Experience,"We went to celebrate our 10th year wedding anniversary. 
This is the best ever hotel experience we have ever had.
This is coming from a Couple (wife and husband) that have visited so many great hotels in and out of the country - around the world. 
The hospitality is second to none. We will never forget this day. 
Thank you very much John (Operational Manager) for your great sense of humour, your professionalism and going extra mile to ensure our stay at Sunborn is a memorable one. You are a great asset to the company.

We will definitely visit again!",5,2024,02,14
119,The services and view was amazing,"The Receptionist is Amazing!!
He is a good guy 
Mr, Ronnie is an amazing guy that helps my staying here nice 
Amara too was amazing too .. will love to come around with my whole family again.. 
we need some African food on board too… 
Surly I’m coming back again",5,2024,02,14
119,It’s a winning cream tea,"I have just had the best afternoon tea at the Suborn London . The food was fantastic and the cocktails were to die for. I have to give a massive shout out to the excellent customer care exhibited by Bertrand and her team. Her customer care skills are beyond anything I have experienced in a long while. You  must visit this place , you will not be disappointed.",5,2024,02,13
119,Great staff! Great experience,"This trip was everything I could ask for in a romantic getaway. We also brought along our young child that was fascinated by the endless wonders to discover. 

 The reception staff were exceptional but to be specific Ronnie’s customers service was first class, he attended to every need we had and was very polite and interpersonal, he definitely added value to the the overall experience. Thank you Ronnie! 

Would visit again",5,2024,02,13
119,Wow!,"We had an afternoon tea on a wowcher deal. What a fantastic Afternoon Tea! Everything was lovely. Staff were super friendly and nothing too much trouble. Wasn't rushed at all, and the food and cocktails were delicious.  Had an amazing time. Thank you!!",5,2024,02,12
119,First class,"Had a last minute stay after working at the Excel and what a treat it was.
From the moment I entered the staff were welcoming and helped me book in.
A big thank you to the Duty Manager RONNIE who was helpful, friendly and treated me wonderfully. His smile was infectious and nothing was too much trouble.
I was very pleased with my beautiful room and the view of the river and Docks was stunning.
I had a very comfortable stay.
The breakfast the next morning was plentiful and delicious with a wide range of choices available and with another glorious view. 
I was sad to leave and would definitely recommend to anyone.
Good location right next to the Excel and the best of a wide choice of hotels in the Victoria Docks area in my opinion.",5,2024,02,05
119,Suprise for my Husbands 50th,"Booked an overnight stay as a suprise for my Husbands 50th birthday. We lunched at the o2 before hitting the cable cars to get us across the water, as I then pretended to need the bathroom before we headed back to the o2 and we made our way onto the Yacht. Jolanta was amazing at not giving anything away as I checked in to a highly confused hubby who swore I was going to get us kicked off. I paid for Balloons, banner and cake and they were better than I expected. The staff are amazingly helpful with anything you asked. There is a lovely scottish bloke working in the bar area but sadly didnt get his name. The yacht is stunning, some reviews will say the rooms are dated but I loved the 'boat theme' personally. I also loved the heated bathroom floor in the middle of the night. We chose a 'Riverview' and I found myself on the balcony in the dark at 4am just enjoying the lights of the o2 against the calm of the water. Mattress was thin but was actually so comfortable as were the lush pillows! I wish I could have purchased a pair! Breakfast was plentiful and more than enough choice but again dependant on what you expect on your stay, some people it seems are never happy. We were more than impressed though and can not wait to plan another stay soon. Try it ~ it wont disapoint",5,2024,02,03
119,10/10 staff!,"Arrived early and the staff were so welcoming and lovely. Jolanta was on desk when we arrived and she couldn’t be any more helpful! Perfect way to start our weekend so thankyou to her. Restaurant food was out of this world too, would highly recommend dinning and stating here. We will be back again soon!",5,2024,02,01
119,Excellent staff and rooms,"Stayed for the week at the Sunborn after extending my initial one night stay. The staff were excellent and the rooms were comfortable and spacious. The reception staff and room service team all provided the best level of customer service and I would like to give a special mention to Ronnie, Sania and John who all made this trip excellent. Will definitely return.",5,2024,02,01
119,£640 then half price on Groupon dissatisfied,"Cost £640 for 2 of us for 2 nights. To then find groupon charging half the price for exactlythe same room same dates. For the cost we expected perfection.  Black Mould in shower , black mould around tiles, was disturbed on 3 occasions by workman for jobs to be done in the room. Surely Sunborn does not feel this is acceptable,? Surely this should be done before guests arrive? so they came in when we was out, mmmm, this is questionable",1,2024,01,30
119,Over nighter,"We did a over nighter on the Sunborn, it was amazing from start to finish, first the staff truly a credit to there company, friendly, helpful couldn’t do enough for you, we had a upgrade to executive suite just wow wow wow, very big room comfy bed very clean, we had a meal at lands end restaurant the food was amazing well presented delicious didn’t have a pudding just couldn’t eat anything else, we will definitely stay there again there’s nothing i could fault about it at all 5⭐️ for me",5,2024,01,28
119,False Advertising and incorrect accounting be careful,"Have stayed at the sunborn many times over the years but it seems that things are going down hill. I proved to them before departure that they had the invoice incorrect yes weeks later they started to chase for money, think they must be in trouble. 

Be very careful when you book if there is an event on at the Excel building you may find the facilities on the Sunborn are closed, even the bar area. They seem to disregard the customers requirements and will rent out even the bar area for company functions, tell residents there is a bar down the road. You may book, but dont plan on being able to eat and drink, it may not be available, I think its classified as false advertising",1,2024,01,27

119,Wouldn’t change a thing!,"I wouldn’t change a thing about my trip here, my partner and myself stayed for one night as a little get away. The yacht itself was absolutely stunning plus the service of all staff who were more than happy to help with anything needed. We enjoyed a 3 course dinner in their restaurant followed by an evening of drinking in the bar, which was very reasonably priced. Breakfast was included with our stay which was buffet style, including a full English, fruits, cereal and pastries. 

Highly recommended to alll!!",5,2024,01,22
119,Not bad,Lovely hotel lovely big rooms and very clean  not much tea selection in rooms and coffee maker not enough milk for stay for two people. Breakfast very busy and only one drinks station one juice and water available but water dispenser broke had to use knife to get it to work.plenty of choice self service style but big queues  the drinks station was very crowded and cloth a table it was on very wet a no staff on hand to help.,4,2024,01,18
119,Lovely Experience,"Staff on the bar and restaurant are respectful and attentive. Rooms very clean and river facing rooms spacious and comfortable- quiet eventhough airport near by 
Food in restaurant is delicious and well presented. 
If your attending the ExCel, there is no better hotel.",5,2024,01,14
119,Lovely afternoon tea,"We booked a Groupon deal for afternoon tea on the Sunborn. 
My daughter and myself. 
The beautiful staircase that leads up to the restaurant deck really sets the scene. We were given a choice of where to sit by Bertrand the host. Such a lovely girl. She was very polite and smiley . 
We chose our cocktails, these were very nice. 
The afternoon tea came out and was excellent. I don’t eat meat and Bertrand asked what i would like in place of the turkey and the ham sandwiches. They were nice and fresh . 
The scones were still warm and came with blackcurrant jam and raspberry jam with a generous helping of clotted cream . There were numerous cakes that were also very good We also came away with a box of cakes as there was such a selection. 
We received very good service from Bertrand and another lady whose name i didn’t get , a blonde lady . She was also very pleasant. 
Sometimes when using afternoon tea vouchers we feel the service isn’t as good , it’s a bit rushed , at no time here did we feel that . There was a calm unhurried feel and i would definitely recommend the tea here . Nice clean toilets, friendly reception staff , a very nice experience all round . Thank you Bertrand for your lovely welcome and service.",5,2024,01,12
119,Stay in January 2024,"Took my husband here for his Christmas present, purchased the romantic package. A bit pricey for what it is but I guess you pay for the location. 
Interior inside the yacht and bedroom was stunning but very dated. The room was very clean and immaculate, had a lovely swan towel and rose petal decorations on the bed and some chocolates on arrival, the view was amazing especially in the morning at sunrise, we had a river view room. The bed was very hard and uncomfortable and didn’t get a lot of sleep, also had to have the aircon on even in January as the room got so hot, and the aircon unit was a bit noisy when trying to sleep. 
Had a 3 course meal included, again lovely seating view of the river and o2/cable cars, only problem I had was I had emailed them prior to arrival for the food menu that would be included in our package, and the menu that was given to us on the night was not the same. There was nothing in their email or on the menu sent that said anything about subject to change, so a little disappointed with that as I was looking forward to eating from the menu that was provided originally. We both had the roast chicken terrine to start, if I’m honest it was ok, but was pretty much like cold leftovers that you would give your dog the following day after a roast dinner. I had the lamb rump for mains and my husband had the beef, both very nice dishes, and we had the sticky toffee pudding which again was very nice. The only advice I would give on this evening is that they need some sort of entertainment, like live music or a dj or just some upbeat music. We had been out all day in Canary Wharf around the bars so had been listening to lively music all day, to then come back to a bit of a mood kill and made us not want to continue the night and just go straight to bed! My husband was still hungry and wanted to get room service later in the evening, but just for a cheese and ham toastie it would have cost him nearly £20! As there was a tray charge and 12.5% service charge too, which I personally think is ridiculous. 
Breakfast in the morning was an average buffet like any 3 star hotel, very busy, and although you could see steam coming off the food in the containers, it was very much cold when you sit down to eat it. All staff we met were very friendly. 
Overall, I would stay here again, but I wouldn’t book a package with dinner included. We would have preferred to eat out somewhere else and have good quality food with a larger option to choose from. I’m not sure on the star rating for this hotel, but if it is meant to be a 5 star, I would definitely say it was more a 3 star on food and 4 star on interior. ",4,2024,01,08
119,Christmas treat to see Peter Kay at the 02,"We stayed her to go and watch Peter Kay at the 02 via the cable car, next time I think we will stay the 02 side instead of the Docklands. We paid extra to have an executive room which only comes with a balcony and a bigger room! We feel for the extra money it could have had more extras like underfloor heating in the bathroom and a bigger shower head, instead of the one we had which was lime scaled! Floor tiles was t nice either! No mini bar either! The bar is very very very overpriced and you pay a discretionary service charge which I wouldn’t mind so much if the service was good but it wasn’t!! It was so slow that I had to go and get my own menu and ask someone for a drink! Also only open an until 12! No room service! Which they have changed as we stayed here in 2016 and they did and was so good and great quality that’s why we come back!!  This time Breakfast was very average and lacked quality ingredients for the money you pay! I would say it’s equivalent to a Travelodge or premier inn breakfast! No Veggie options either apart from you could ask for a veggie sausage but how long would that take? Why not ask when people check inn to see if they have any dietary requirements so they could work out and have some ready??? Considering the call themselves an executive Yacht Hotel we thought now was only average and very overpriced and will not be staying again!!!",3,2024,01,07
119,4 Stars from us…,"Hotel executive room with river view, bit dated but clean and spacious, comfy bed, hairdryer, iron & ironing board, fridge, coffee maker & pods, complimentary water & chocolates. Breakfast is buffet style and the food was cold on both days, just awful. 
Fabulous food at the Docklands Bar & Grill a couple of minutes walk away and reasonably priced. Parking in Nova Hotel car park across the way £25 for 24hrs. Great location for cable cars and the train station into central london which is a few minutes walk away. ",4,2024,01,05
119,Pleasant Stay at Sunborn London.,"Had a lovely stay at Sunborn London celebrating a birthday. The view was nice, the room itself was clean and looked liked what it did in photos. Staff are also friendly and welcoming, I would recommend.",4,2024,01,04
119,Stunning,"Stunning. Amazing rooms, very clean and spacious. A fridge included along with an ironing board, iron and hairdryer. Service was amazing and breakfast was delicious. The bar food looked nice and good cocktails. What a way to see in 2024!!!we will be back.",5,2024,01,02
119,Lands End - Poor food & service,"We stayed on the sunburn for 1 night and decided to push the boat out, excuse the pun, and we ate in Lands End restaurant which is on the boat. 
Firstly we had to book in which was nice as I could request a window table to enjoy our anniversary stay over looking London,  On arrival we were told no reservations can be made and it’s first come first serve. 
Secondly, the restaurant is very heavily over priced for the food that comes out. £15.5 for a ton of frozen tuna does not resemble the salmon starter dish offered in the menus. 
The lobster tagliatelle as a main had no flavour what so ever. The fact I had to keep putting salt and pepper on my food should say to a waiter something doesn’t look right, however because they where so busy could of been why not one waiter came to us and asked if our food was ok on each dish. ( very disappointing as you get this service in most standard restaurant chains so I’m not sure what the manager is doing there ? ) Finally the dessert which was recommended by the waiter after my comments on the starter and main being flavourless was no better and the taster of hard water in all the food is not worth spending £240 for a 3 course meal for 2 people and a glass of Prosecco. 
Thanks but no thanks to the manager who offered a free glass of Prosecco at the end after another comment being made. 
I would recommend the local restaurants around the docks for a better dining experience. 
I can’t fault the boat and room we stayed in once it was warmed up and the extra hour late check out because we booked direct was a nice add on.  ",1,2023,12,31
119,Our happy place for quality time together ,"This was our second visit to Sunborn hotel, due to the comfort of the rooms and excellent food and of course the river view. This time to celebrate our wedding anniversary.we were greeted by the manager, Amara Fonade who went above and beyond to get us checked in early and gave us a complementary drink. Exceptional customer service, Thankyou.
Looking forward to coming again in spring .
Also thanks to Manny in the bar, for remembering us and excellent service.

119,A lovely hotel with a difference ,"We stayed here on 28th December for 1 night. The hotel was lovely. The staff were all very friendly and polite. The room had everything you would need, was very clean and spacious too. The bed was extremely comfortable. 
We had a 3 course meal in the restaurant, it was nice and quiet at 6pm and a nice atmosphere. The food was lovely and fresh and great portion sizes. 
We didn't order anything in the bar but it looked very nice. 
Breakfast was great, the food was fresh and there was a lot of choice. 
I cannot fault our stay and will definitely return. ",5,2023,12,30
119,Good but should have been spectacular,"This hotel could be so good but sadly it was not. We stayed here for 2 nights over Christmas. There were issues with the room which was lovely, but warped cupboards and no coffee pods was disappointing. Dinner was lovely and food great, but there were issues with reservations, and breakfast was a shambles, it could and should be so much better. The were little or no festive activities laid on by the hotel other than a movie on Christmas Day. Finally a 12.5% service charge was added to our bill for both evening meals. This was not made clear at anytime in the booking process. We bought the festive package which included room, breakfast, and dinner on Christmas Eve and Christmas Day. Had we had booked bed and breakfast, and the two dinners separately, it would have been cheaper, so I’m not sure what the benefit of the package was especially having to pay even more for the service charge. Overall a good hotel, that should be spectacular.",3,2023,12,28
119,One night Xmas stay at Sunborn.,"Went for a one night stay at Sunborn. It is easily located from Custom House station. The hotel is by the London Excel.  The hotel reception has  a nice appearance with the central staircase. The reception staff were welcoming. Our room was lovely and we received a complimentary upgrade. We had both evening meal and breakfast, which were both delicious. All the staff  at the hotel  were friendly and professional. Thanks for a lovely stay. ",4,2023,12,28
119,Beware if you book the Sunborne Hotel.,"Great location and staff but beware!

We were emailed 5 FIVE days before our arrival date that the main bar & restaurant would be closed to us.

Whilst the option was given to us to cancel and be refunded, our booking was made 4 FOUR months previously as a special occasion to see a concert at The 02.

Upon arrival we found out that the main areas were closed because of an all day/evening IT function/conference, which clearly would have been known about months in advance.

Whilst we were 'upgraded' we already had booked a very good room and were basically moved to a quieter part of the hotel.

As we left the hotel to go to the 02 it was so enjoyable seeing all the IT delegates enjoying themselves in the bars, on deck and throughout, with some later rather too drunk.

Would we stay again?
No!

You take a risk booking the Sunborne hotel only to find out days before that some of the main facilities are not available as advertised even though the hotel knew months in advance that they wouldn't be.",2,2023,12,27
119,Boatifull,"Just came back from a two night stay 
Absolutely loved the hotel 
Found all the staff very professional and all always happy and helpful 
Breakfast although busy ( our fault for going late ) food I thought was very good quality and plentiful the first morning the coffee machine was out of action ( thing’s happen) but fixed for the next day 
Very relaxing in the bar area
Rooms were very large for a standard room and very clean 
Loved it so much coming back in March",5,2023,12,22
119,Welcome to the floating hotel,"The Sunborn is berthed next to the Excel exhibition centre - 5 minutes from Custom House DLR and Elizabeth train lines and 7 minutes from the cable car that takes you across the Thames to the O2. It is also about 15 minutes from London City airport (DLR change at Canning Town). You enter via the lift from quayside that takes you up to reception. Our cabin (not room) was generous in size with quality fittings, furnishings and toiletries. We were meeting with friends in the evening so did not have dinner on board - just breakfast. Nice selection of continental and hot buffet. I particularly enjoyed the bacon which was just to my taste  -a little crispy - not limp and fatty as is the case for a number of hot buffets. If you don't like the high seas but fancy testing out life on board a yacht then this may be for you. ",4,2023,12,22
119,Birthday Stay,"From booking to checking in, the staff were fabulous. The hotel was fantastic, room was very spacious and clean. Decor was very plush and brihgt. Great views over the river when having breakfast.
- Feedback : When creating a booking there was a section to write about your visit, i always fill this in if we have having a speacial occassion to see what reactions we get. On this visit i said it was for a belated 50th Birthday for my wife, they musn't have read it because no one commented on it, so they must ignore the comment section. 
The restuarnt manager and his deputy must learn how to talk and treat staff. Shouting at them and being abrupt will not instill any confidence in them.  ",5,2023,12,22
119,Pleasant ,"Beautiful place for a lovely city break! 
Most of all the staff at the front desk were exceptionally helpful,  friendly and polite both during checking in and checkout times
Very comfortable and crisp clean bedrooms. 
",4,2023,12,21
119,Fabulous ,"Had an amazing time at this hotel, excellent friendly staff, helpful and polite, upgraded to a river view which didn't disappoint, we had a meal in the restaurant, really nice food I think the only down side was the cost of a bottle of wine at £39 when you can buy it for £8 in a supermarket, George (not sure if spelt right) was a brilliant waiter, made me laugh service with a smile excellent, breakfast was nice but cold but otherwise couldn't fault this hotel.",5,2023,12,16
119,Birthday Visit to London,"Great staff, great location the Elizabeth line takes you right in to town. The hotel is lovely and clean very well kept. Great views! Will visit again no doubt. I would not have been able to afford the upgrade but they upgraded us free of charge as it was a birthday. The birthday balloon package is worth the £25",5,2023,12,14
119,"""Faulty computer system""","I'm writing this more for feedback to the hotel. I booked a night for my wife's 35th birthday direct with Sunborn London. I went for the executive river view room so we could wake up to amazing views. 

On my booking form, under the ""special requirements"" section, I asked for the room to have some special touches for my wife's 35th birthday, if possible. I also added I'd be adding my own touches to the room. We arrived to the corridor of our room and my wife seen a balloon filled with helium and a happy birthday on the floor, outside a room.

She got very excited. That was for another guest though. Our room was on the opposite side.

We got inside and the room was plain. No sign, no balloon, no special bed designs.

There was a postcard on the table wishing my wife a happy birthday and 4 lovely individual chocolates.

She was very happy but as you can imagine I was disappointed, especially when we both seen the balloon and banner on our way to our room.

I went to reception and spoke to the receptionist about seeing the balloon and banner (there are pictures on Google of the same set up that Sunborn London do for birthdays) and what we received in our room for a birthday. The lady said I should have sent an email and they would have emailed me all the packages they do. I explained I thought if I wrote it on my actual booking form where it says ""special requirements"" this would be suffice. She once again told me basically I enquired wrong (no apology from her but a telling off).

A senior manager took over from the lady because he could clearly see I wasn't happy. I explained it to him and he apologised immediately. He explained it was because I booked through a 3rd party company and this was the reason my room wasn't decorated like they usually would. 

I didnt book through a 3rd party. All of my £200+ monies went to Sunborn London and I received a booking confirmation from SL. This upset me and had me second guessing if the website was genuine when he realised he apologised again and said he would offer me a discount for 2024 as they will have a much larger boat then.

I respect the staff member that tried to resolve the issue and I didnt cause a scene but I did refuse to book another stay especially when this stay has left a sour taste with me.

I was also told I had to pay for breakfast and asked for £20.50 each because it shown on their system I booked through a 3rd party site. This upset me and made me question again if the Sunborn London website was even genuine. The lovely member of staff who was checking in breakfast guests went to check at reception as she could see I was upset that I believed it was included (it was). She came back with a big smile on her face, apologised to us and said we have breakfast included.

Despite the communication blips, the hotel itself, the staff (majority of them), the food was absolutely incredible and shouldn't be taken away from a fantastic stay.

The website needs to make it clear that breakfast is included and if special occasion packages are available (dressing of rooms for birthdays, engagement etc, it needs to be clear on the website. There should also be some form of acknowledgement that a special request can or can't be authorised.

119,18th birthday weekend away,"Lovely weekend away fro my partners birthday. Great location next to the excel with an extremely short walk to custom house (nearest tube station). A beautiful location as well as a glorious boat. The bar is expensive but a treat! Cocktails were lovely and staff were so helpful. Breakfast being included is a bonus as a lovlry buffet. 

We ate at a near by restaurant called “top 1 forever” who had the most gorgeous steak! Reasonably priced too!

All in all a lovely stay.",4,2023,12,11
119,Def 5 star stay,"My daughter booked this break for our 10th anniversary, having stayed there previously. 
She was worried standards may have dropped but that certainly wasn’t the case. I was totally impressed by the whole experience from start to finish and having taken the cable car in, felt like a film star!! Bed was super comfy, underfloor heating in bathroom and super bright cabin with amazing views. It was a five star for me and we will return.",5,2023,12,07
119,What an experience! You have to stay here! ,"Lovely and unique stay on The Sunborn Yacht in an amazing location, with views of the O2 and a five minute cable ride that takes you directly to the O2, only cost £6 each way! Staff were welcoming and accommodating, the overall exterior and interior was fantastic, would recommend staying here again, everything was perfect from the minute we arrived. Loads of shops,  food stalls and some quirky restaurants, you really are spoilt for choice. ",5,2023,12,06
119,Dissatisfied disappointed not luxury sadly poor basics missing at breakfast simply not good enough to be luxury ,"Where do we begin.....
Luxury it is not..
Lovely change from a normal hotel...
However Disabled parking is available you have to fight for this as we requested it and the front desk said No then another person we email said yes...we do offer this to blue badge holders only...so very mixed messages even before we arrived ....
So we booked an classic /executive king size room...
On arrival we entered via the lift as only way in..
Opens into beautiful stair case..
And reception to the 1 side 
See pics...
Sadly that's where we felt it went down hill...
We booked in to the room only to be told we won't be having the executive room 
As there 2 busy but the room we have for you is on the docs side level 2 
We were ok with this...
So off we went with the key
To the room...
It was good on entry...
Large king bed ..with a lounge TV area...bathroom
Etc no bath showere only
Window does not open view to The downside is ok for us...
We though?
No coffee no milk 2 little bottles of water in the fridge
We found the coffee machine could get it work...
But we got help from a housekeeping ...but still only 1 type of excressoncoffee given and it's strong yuck..
We decided not to eat in the restaurant due to the prices ..and reviews..
£32 for a bowl of seafood pasta....really???
So we highly recommend the tai restaurant and the others there a lot of good ones on the docs...The bathroom has under floor heating omg it was so so hot and the hair dryer is on there as well and is so hot you can't use it...
Without trying to hold the door open ..not good at all...way to hot.
The showere get etc is small complement the little wee bottles but nice stuff..
The towels are nice to.
We had to turn the air conditioning on as it was so so stuffy...to hot without the air con it would of been worse...without being able to get fresh air into the room isnot great at all ..we found this difficult and hot and stuffy..
Had to buy water as well .form local shop as no enough water I. The room..
We also found our room did not get cleaned the next day..
And was told we had to go out or leave the room...however we were out till 830am -130 pm
So to be told that by housekeeping in a rude manner shouted at us thought the open door....
How rude was that ...
So not happy with that at all..
Ok now to the worst thing..,
Breakfast .... omg 😱
Shocking in every way
Wobbly table...no service 
No side plates no bowls 
No tea pots meat market is better disgusting ..
The tea and coffee area ridiculous tiny cups no saucers you have to carry it through the restaurant..
Oh the houces are ther as well....tea bags all over the place as no where to bin...
The food not good at all..
No fruit no yogurt no bowls to use .....no bread the buffet was like warm sausages were yuck egg was yuck...no continental left and not replace at!8.45 am..gowsbtill 10 am so I asked..for some andndi get any..
Done clear the table at all until people left..mm
Disgusting it really is no way luxury more market cafe standard we had better at local cafe...
Saldy this was not what we expected and poor service poor food poor rooms...sadly it was my wife birthday and nothing extra was given nothing ....unless we paid extra...
Ye the night before at 100 pound night room we had completely wine and flowered in the room with a card ...
But this sunburn luxury yacht  it is not luxury ..
Sadly it was a real disaster and so disappointed..
We did feedback to them and they have offered us a return trip at a reduced rate.
...and apologies but not told us what price ???

119,A perfect Stay.,"This place is nothing short of amazing. from cool to chic this hotel has it all. The rooms are spacious, very clean and comfortable. The staff are extremely attentive and very polite. We loved our stay at the Sunborn. We cant thank you and your staff enough for making our stay perfect. :-)",5,2023,12,04
119,Fantastic stay as always,"Such a lovely hotel with stunning views and so close to the 02. Staff are amazing and the rooms are immaculate. Breakfast is varied, delicious and there's always plenty of it. 3rd visit and as always we love staying aboard the Sunborn  and can't wait to visit again!",5,2023,12,03
119,Beautiful hotel,Beautiful hotel. Spotlessly clean. Easy to get to Very helpful staff. Breakfast catered for everything was very tasty but to be honest could have been hotter. That’s why only 4 stars.  Last time we had a balcony which was lovely but this time just a window didn’t matter though as was too cold to go outside.  😂😂😂,4,2023,12,03
119,Wonderful experience! ,"An incredible 2 nights on the Yacht. The suite was amazing, clean and really comfortable. Everyone enjoyed the food at breakfast and it catered for all tastes. The highlight was the great service and care shown by the staff in all departments. A lovely team! 
Would definitely recommend and return should we be in that part of London again. Well done ‘Sunborn Yacht’ 👏👏",5,2023,12,03
119,our trip away,"we stay here on friday till sunday all staff very helpful i would like to say thank to the staff for letting us check out later 

i would like mention 2 of the staff name who is really wonderful and nice and they organise a breakfast to be sent up to are room and they bought it on a tray to our room  ode and Sania",5,2023,12,03
119,Could have been much better organised ,"Terrible place to stay it  is dirty and  out of date the customer service is a disgrace as previously mentioned in other reviews this place has no care or compassion if you have a bad experience rooms not ready on time for stated arrival time as advertised room was given at 4.30 pm
And that said it was still dirty and dusty and no apology what so ever. Just offered us to stay again at a more expensive price than what we had previously paid 😡 not acceptable.
Having said the above it’s a unique experience if you can get a Woucher offer the breakfast was nice lots of different choices. ",1,2023,12,01
119,Lovely London break in great location,"We wanted to drop off our luggage early and then go into the city. We were welcomed by a friendly and efficient gentleman, who quickly helped us with the luggage, and, when we asked if we could use the bar to get drinks, were welcomed and promptly served. 
The staff in the bar were friendly and helpful too.  As we were leaving, (to come back later to check in), the same man told us our room was ready early, and we could check in. This level of outstanding customer service is what makes the Sunborn an outstanding place to stay. 
Our room, an executive dock side with balcony was pleasantly furnished, very clean, and well appointed with everything we needed.
 Breakfast offered plenty of choice of good food, both hot and cold food and pastries etc and was buffet style. 
The location and high standard of accommodation and service make it an ideal place to stay for a London visit. 
Thank you to all the staff who made our stay so enjoyable.",5,2023,11,28
119,Return visit definitely didn't disappoint...,"Absolutely loved our weekend on The Sunborn. From the first welcome to check out, the staff were welcoming and very helpful. Our river view room was very comfortable, well equipped and having the balcony and view really added an additional element.  Everything was clean, comfortable bed and bath robes and slippers a great extra. The location is also great, parking at the Excel is so convenient and access to the 02 Arena, cable cars, train, restaurants etc make exploring easy. For  us, this hotel is fabulous and offers the comfort and services that meet all our needs. Love it.",5,2023,11,27
119,Amazing 50th Birthday Weekend at The Sunborn ,I spent a wonderful weekend at The Sunborn for my 50th Birthday....staff are so friendly and welcoming and cannot do enough for you.  I was impressed before I even arrived with corresponding with staff over the telephone.  Stayed with friends on the Saturday where we had plans in Shoreditch and it's a great location to base yourself due to the connections of getting around.  I love the calmness of being on the water that allows you to escape the busy parts of London.  Enjoyed a birthday celebration on the Sunday with other friends arriving for Afternoon Tea.  I then got to enjoy another night on my own to embrace a lovely weekend in a beautiful hotel.  Breakfast both days so good too.  I love The Sunborn Hotel and it will always be my first choice in staying in London.  Highly recommend to stay when in London.  5 star and beyond for the staff and hotel.,5,2023,11,20
119,A unique get away ,"Wow what a unique experience! The room was spacious and clean, views from the balcony  were amazing. Staff were polite and efficient. The breakfast buffet had a good selection. Thoroughly enjoyed our stay. 
",5,2023,11,13
119,MadDog returns To the Sunborn,"Mrs MadDog treated me to a birthday night out on the Sunborn.  The weather was a bit grim but we soldiered on anyway. As with our first visit the staff are still great, very smiley and helpful. The guys on check-in gave me a balcony for my birthday which was very nice so we got a bit of sunbathing in before going out for the afternoon/evening!
Rooms are comfy and well decorated, clean and well appointed with all the normal bits and bobs that go with them. The bar is tasteful and comfortable ,pricey, but you are in London so.........
We didn't have dinner here but had breakfast as part of our stay which is very very good. Offerings are full English if you need it including Veggie sausages ,multiple cereals, multiple breads and pastries toast and continental breakfast including cold meats , cheeses and more than one type of cold fish (smoked salmon and mackerel).
One reviewer moaned that she had beans and eggs for breakfast as she was Veggie, but it would seem she had an agenda with her whole stay , so I'll let you decide dear reader, but you couldn't have a better buffet so there!
While we are still at breakfast, have to say that they have a sign up saying that it is busiest between 9-10 and it is a bit of a bunfight. The queue goes quite quickly it's not a major disaster. My only gripe-ish was that hot breakfast (again) used to be served and they used to offer a couple of items extra which we didn't ask for so I can't complain as such but......

All in all a very nice stay and we will be back.

MadDog says"" All aboard shipmates"".",5,2023,11,12
119,"Wonderful experience, definately hope to visit again","I booked a one night stay at the Sunborn Yacht Hotel as a surprise 25 year wedding anniversary gift for my husband.

We had such a great experience.  All the staff were really helpful and friendly.  When we got to our room we had a lovely little anniversay message and some chocolate truffles waiting for us which was a lovely surprise.

The room was big, spacious and comfortable.  The breakfast was delicious and filling.  The hotel itself felt very luxious and was everything that I was expecting.  Location is fab and easy to get to.

Thank you for making our stay special, I definately hope to come back again.",5,2023,11,12
119,Brilliant👍👍👍,"Lovely clean hotel with excellent facilities. The room was spacious and well equipped and the views over the Thames were amazing. Staff were very helpful and kind. Location for the O2 and Excel Centre perfect and very close to Custom House tube station for easy access into central London.
I cannot rate this hotel highly enough as it is the best I have stayed in for a long time.
",5,2023,11,11
119,Amazing ,"I would like to thank the lovely night staff Jorge,gordon, Djibrel for making my birthday night so beautiful and wonderful they are a credit to the sunburn hotel and are such outstanding and respectful employees. I had an amazing stay because of their attentiveness and understanding. ",5,2023,11,09
119,Fabulous setting for a celebration or romantic getaway,"Just stayed for one night to celebrate my husbands 60th birthday and wished we could stay longer. Lovely hotel, smart, comfortable and staff so friendly and helpful. Beautifully clean and they gave us a free upgrade to a beautiful room which had a small balcony. The food was nice although limited menu for a short period. Next door to the Excel centre with bars and eateries. Lovely bar area with great views of  canary wharf which would be lovely in the summer sitting outside. We really enjoyed our stay.",5,2023,11,09
119,Luxury yacht in London,"Our third visit over the years. Lived up to previous experiences. Internal decor of public areas is luxurious. Bedroom (executive room) very good. River view is essential! Breakfast and evening snacks (in bar) enjoyable. Particularly impressed by helpfulness of staff, especially Office Manager Raul, who went out of his way to help us in many ways, especially with accommodation and breakfast. This made our stay very memorable. The yacht is well positioned for visits to central London, with both tube and DLR very close. ExCel Centre is next door! Parking (if required) very close (but expensive for 24 hours). We have already booked another stay in February!",5,2023,11,05
119,Another excellent stay!,"This is our third stay here and another excellent one. Staff were super friendly and welcoming and our room was gorgeous. The location of the yacht makes it so easy to get everywhere and it was a shame that we had a function to attend that night as we would liked to have spent more time there in the evening. Had drinks and bar snacks before going out, chips were amazing and we had food envy from those eating dinner. A very comfortable night’s sleep was followed by a tasty filling breakfast.
Can’t wait for our next visit! ",5,2023,11,04
119,Nice stay,Stayed here for my birthday following a visit to the sunborn in Gibraltar! Very nice hotel and Great location!staff were really friendly and the room we had was massive!fully recommend the hotel if staying in the east London area. Will visit again,4,2023,11,03
119,FABULOUS 👌,"Just want to say I had a fantastic customer service from the Manger Amara Fouade,he went above and beyond to get the room decorated and upgraded my room due to booking. Com bleep in service. Also the staff were lovely, I would recommend all my friends to stay and il be back 100% 
Nosheen Iqbal ",5,2023,10,30
119,Over priced and outdated- horrendous customer service.  AVOID! ,"We were so looking forward to this... something a bit different and a novelty, and at the price, we expected great things. 

We stayed for 2 nights, and whilst the location was great for what we needed (cable car, river taxis, tube station, pubs and restaurants, and the O2 all very close by), that was all this hotel really had going for it. 

Our room (an executive river view) just felt very dated. Spacious enough, but cold. The air conditioning seemed to stay on, even though we had turned it off. We couldn't even have a hot shower to warm up as the tap was stuck - making it luke warm at best. We had to manoeuvre a shower head by the sink, awkwardly into the shower, just to use hot water! 

On our second night, the reception called and woke us up to ask us if everything was OK with the room. When I asked why, they stated that it didn't matter and then hung up. We then endured a whole night of what can only be described as a sewage smell which permeated the entire 5th floor and kept us awake. We couldn't contact reception via phone as the line had gone dead, and despite emails to the front desk, we heard nothing and received no explanation or apology whatsoever. Several other guests on our floor encountered the same issues and when raised with staff, were told that they would pass it on to the ""relevant person."" 

The hotel was busy during the morning of our check out and it seemed that staff didn't really know how to handle crowds all that well. 

We ate breakfast both days, as it was included, but I am vegetarian and there was no option for me, other than eggs, tomatoes, and beans. I've had better with Travelodge and Premier Inn, to be honest. 

The worst thing about this hotel for me is the disregard for customer service. They seem to not care once you've booked in, whether you're having a nice time or not. We have sent a complaint email, but a week later, have still not received a response. Disgusting.

",1,2023,10,29
119,Comfortable but no thrills,"We stayed for one night during the week. The rooms are really spacious and have all the bits needed, such as toiletries, iron, tea/coffee and a fridge. The bed was large and comfortable, but there was just a generally dated feel about the room.

The reception were efficient and friendly, and the hotel is situated in a good place for nearby restaurants.",3,2023,10,28
119,Afternoon tea for a friend's birthday.,"I visited Sunborn with my friend for afternoon tea. The afternoon tea itself was lovely. Fresh sandwiches, best scones I've had in a long time, cakes were hit and miss depending on your taste. The carrot cake was a little dry. Our afternoon tea came with a cocktail which was also nice. Walking into Sunborn had a wow factor with the big chandelier and the stair case. Clean reception and toilets. The restaurant wasn't very fancy for a yacht and the hot chocolate was from a machine where you press a button and it tasted like coffee where it goes through the same system. So that was disappointing because the afternoon tea was not cheap. So I would offer a nicer hot chocolate or coffee. The man who served us was very polite and accommodating. I'm allergic to salmon so he swapped my sandwiches for what I wanted Instead. The restaurant wasn't busy so we didn't feel rushed.",4,2023,10,26
119,Great place to stay but eat out,"This is an excellent place to stay with stunning views of the dock. A real novelty and would be an excellent retreat if you were having a few days in London as you can get the river taxi into the centre. 

The positive things is the location. We had an executive cabin which was immaculate and comfortable, with a little balcony that looked right over the dock. We loved watching the planes coming into London airport. The room was warm and quiet with bathrobes and slippers (only one towel which was weird), complimentary bottled water and nice toiletries. The breakfast was really tasty with loads of choice although a little lukewarm. The manager at breakfast was really welcoming. The staff are all very friendly and attentive and constantly on the go. The decor is super glitzy. Not my cup of tea but I’m sure lots of folk would love it and it’s spotless.

The negatives I think are more to do with the management. We were bought this experience for our 25th anniversary and it had dinner included. When we booked we discovered by chance that we had to book dinner separately, so could easily have turned up and not been able to get a table. Then when we arrived they couldn’t find our booking for ages. The girl at the desk just looked panicked and  repeatedly asked our names and for the reference number. The other guy there remedied it more calmly but it was hardly a warm or relaxing welcome. The bar is a bit ridiculous… it was practically empty and had four staff but they took aaaaages to bring the drinks we ordered. We think they were also servicing the restaurant upstairs as they were glued to their computer and having panicky conversations all the time. At one point our drinks were just sat on the bar for what seemed like eternity and we considered just nipping over and collecting them. Was all a bit strange. When we went up for dinner they were panicking again as another couple had come up and ‘pretended to be us’. Sharing this with us was just unprofessional and stressy, they should have just handled it. The dinner was very average. Desert and cheeseboard was delicious though.

So in short. A great place to stay but maybe have your drinks and dinner elsewhere. If the management can sort the place out better then I’m sure it would be a wonderful place for dinner and drinks but it’s not there yet.",4,2023,10,26
119,Perfect,"Myself and my husband stayed here for my husbands 40th birthday, from the moment we arrived to the moment we left everything was perfect. 
Check in was quick and efficient, and they do have the option to now check in online.
We were upgraded to a room with a balcony, we were over looking the excel so not a fab view but as we were only there for one night this didn't bother us. 
Room was spacious and clean with its own towels, shampoo and conditioner, also a vanity kit (earspuds, cotton wool). There were robes and slippers, a safe, extra towels and an ironing board and iron.
Reception were extremely helpful, we needed an emergency sewing kit which they found for us and bought to our room.
We ate dinner in the Landsend restaurant on the 4th floor, the food was amazing, they also bought over a chocolate truffle board and a glass of champagne each for my husbands birthday which was a nice little touch.
We finished the evening in the sundown bar on the 3rd floor with cocktails.
Couldn't fault anything at all with our stay here.",5,2023,10,25
119,"Excellent location for events, bland breakfast","Stayed here with my spouse because of an event at the Excel, and I was positively surprised. Our room was spacious and clean, and surprisingly quiet even though it was a busy weekend. The staff was always really helpful and friendly.

The only minus was the breakfast: for a hotel that markets itself as a luxurious yacht experience, the food at breakfast was a huge letdown. The warm food was bland and yougurt portions really tiny. At least the pastries were okay.",4,2023,10,24
119,Sunborn excellence!!,"Commending the excellent customer service provided by the front desk team starting with Raul, Konstantinos, Djibrill, Euridice, and Augusta! All were attentive and kind especially Raul…. Who spoiled us with attention and professionalism during our stay by making sure all our requests were handled! Also, Sarwar, George and Balaj in F&B…. Very attentive as well especially Sarwar who made sure we had our Americano coffees each day!!! Wow! He made us feel like we were the only guests there!!! All these employees/team players make the Sunborn shine!!! Please commend them and make them know how much we appreciated them!!! They made the difference! Thank you all!!",5,2023,10,22
119,Average stay.,"Clean rooms, friendly staff,  very average service, I booked a balcony room with a river view, and  got a room with a dock view, disappointing  as this was a romantic weekend, was told we are full so it is what it is.very expensive bar, and the breakfast was very cold. Regardless of the wonderfull boat , this a floating holiday inn.",3,2023,10,15
119,Amazing afternoon tea on Sunborn,"My friend and I had a an amazing afternoon tea today on the Sunborn today.  The food was so very good, but so much we took goody bags home with us, beautiful surroundings and lovely staff.  I would definitely recommend Sunborn to anyone.  It was a windy day and my friend was very nervous being on the cable car from North Greenwich
I would love to stay here overnight",5,2023,10,13
119,Unique sleepover in London.,"What a very special place as an overnight stay before an early flight from London City Airport.
Staff so very obliging. Room, fabulous, and all public spaces smart and gleaming.....and all for a reasonable cost.
Good selection for breakfast with  unique hiew of London.
Try it, it's a unique experience in London.",5,2023,10,12
119,The best time,"I had been looking forward to staying at the Sunborn since the first time I had ever discovered it; it did not disappoint! 
Enter to the reception via the lift, which is protected with access to other floors with a key card only. The reception area was brightly lit with an amazing chandelier and 2 way stair case. 
Check in was easy, not over crowded. Finding the room was easy. 
We were lucky enough to have our room upgraded from a classic room to an executive room, meaning we had a balcony, more space, slippers & robes and some other luxuries. Very much appreciated! 
We ate dinner at the bar which was also brilliant. Table service, good menu choices, short wait times, plenty of seating. It was around 7pm when we dined. The burger meal was very generous, the tomato chutney served on the side was very tasty. At £18 a meal, we were very happy with the service and the food we received. 
The only slight concern, was that the bar appeared to be open to anyone, not stayers. Many groups of young people in tracksuits were walking in and out of the area. We would have appreciated a more private area, but didn't cause any issue. 
Breakfast the next morning was good. Very busy at 9:30, we took the last remaining table! Some small portions of yogurt, yogurt & granola, hot breakfast, mini pastries etc. The usual breakfast set up. The coffee, flat white, from the machine was not nice. 
Check out was simple! Over all, a fantastic experience, already recommending to all my friends! ",5,2023,10,12
119,Nice hotel with a few issues,"Positives - lovely airy room with a good sized balcony and comfy bed. Very good breakfast. 

Negatives - room was right next to the entrance door to the floor and was constantly banging until the early hours of the morning. This could simply be resolved by putting soft closers on the door to stop it slamming! Would request a room further away from the lift to avoid this!  
Also bar service was very slow as unable to order at the bar and had to wait for the only waiter serving everyone. Then charged £3 service charge on top! Shouldn’t have ordered a large soda and lime because that was £5!!  The beer was only £7.50 which was reasonable.",4,2023,10,11
119,Birthday Treat ,"Lovely yacht, due to a mix up with booking (we had the booking ref no but not on their system) we were upgraded to a better cabin. However, although nice, didn't seem an upgrade to what we had booked. Food and drink quite expensive but what we'd expected. 
Very close to Custom House so great base for getting to touristy places! ",4,2023,10,09
119,Our favorite place to stay in London! ,"We first stayed here the year it opened for our wedding anniversary and have been going back ever since. Taking friend's who are now also return customers and family too! 
Its a great place to stay, easily accessible for 02, Canary Warf, London City Airport, and central London a short hop into town on the Elizabeth line, or alternatively via the cable car and river boat.
The staff are lovely the rooms are spacious with comfy beds and pillows and a good shower and breakfast! 
My one ask would be larger cup for my morning coffee :)",5,2023,10,06
119,I liked this place except the bar,"Stayed here for 2 nights over the weekend.  Great location, spacious and clean room. Breakfast was good and plentiful.  But the bar, very slow service and the drinks are horrendously priced. And that’s before the ridiculous service charge. We had one drink here all weekend. Avoid!",3,2023,10,03
119,Room with a view,"We had an amazing time.
Lovely room with a river view and small balcony.
Service was great, we ate in the restaurant on board. Food was lovely and service to match. 
Would definitely recommend the experience.
Walking distance to the cable cars which can take you over to the 02 within 12 minutes.",5,2023,10,03
119,Amazing Venue,Attended for my niece’s 21st and had an amazing time.  We chose the hotel for the novelty of staying somewhere different and it didn’t disappoint.  We had afternoon tea which is the best we have ever had compared to anywhere else we’ve been.  We had 2 river view rooms which were exceptionally clean and comfortable.  We had drinks from the bar which we didn’t feel were overpriced considering we were in London.  All staff we spoke to were professional and welcoming and we will definitely be back - we loved it.  Thank you all at Sunborne.,5,2023,10,02
119,Lovely hotel ...but!!!.,Free room upgrade on arrival staff were brilliant lovely clean room with a balcony. We didn't eat here apart from Breakfast which to tell the truth was very disappointing  buffet style and lukewarm no saucers or spoons with cups at machine you have to queue for usually a hotel of this standard serves tea coffee directly to the table. Sausages my pet hate is that everywhere uses cheap rubbish this was no exception. No tongs when choosing pastries (how many people have handled them before you get yours?). The bar at the end of the evening we decided to have a drink before retiring 3 single sprits whith mixers horrified to get the bill for £45 this cannot be described as a rip off more like blatant theft. At the hotel opposite 2 doubles and 2 single cost £36 i can buy a bottle of jack daniels and a bottle of gin myself for under £50 i can understand a mark up but come on really? £45 for 3 drinks ?. I'm glad we didn't have an evening meal i would have had to sell my house.,4,2023,09,30
119,"Nice Venue, Poorly run","Nice venue, poorly run. 
Came for 2 nights and left disappointed. The hotel is staffed by mainly non speaking English people who do not understand basic questions and get orders wrong. Service in the bar was terrible, waiting 45 minutes for drinks. Served by staff who lack basic hygiene levels and need deodorant. 2 of them reeked of B.O. We ended up using the Good Hotel a five minute walk away for food a drinks as the Sunborn were overpriced and  the service so bad. 
Really need to train their bar staff and waiters properly.",2,2023,09,30
119,Great food- Disappointing Service .,"Having travelled 80 miles for this we were somewhat disappointed.
Arrived for our afternoon tea to be told we weren’t booked in, I showed the booking confirmation but again told we weren’t booked in.
I queried this and again showed my booking confirmation.  I was then advised to wait, 3 staff huddled around the desk discussing the booking.  Eventually we were shown to a dirty table and asked to wait whilst it was cleared, this was despite there being multiple other tables already laid up and none of which were used for the duration of our visit.
Our food was brought out and it was very well prepared and very tasty (no complaints).
However, we waited for the pots of tea to go with our food ,  but nothing arrived! We had now been seated for an hour.
We called over a member of staff to request the tea, no apology was given, another 10 minutes later they finally brought out the drinks, but brought coffee not tea.
They rectified this quickly but by now the day was tainted and certainly not as delightful as it should have been.

A shame as we had so looked forward to it.",3,2023,09,27
119,Lovely hotel let down by grubby bed,"A lovely hotel let down by a poor bed.  While the linen was clean, the bed frame was grubby and dirty, with a thin mattress.  Expected better.  Otherwise spacious room, nice staff and tasty breakfast.",4,2023,09,27
119,Night away,"Staff very welcoming and friendly.  Had lovely cabin which was very clean,bed was lovely and comfy,had a great  view of the river ,O2 etc.  Breakfast was very nice and staff on hand if you had any issues. Will certainly be back .plenty pubs and restaurants close by if u fancy eating out.",5,2023,09,25
119,Unique stay in London ,"Fabulous hotel in a great location just outside of central London. Close to O2 and under group stations. Great welcome as soon as we arrived and staff all very attentive and polite and friendly. 
Would recommend 100%! ",5,2023,09,25
119,"Lovley staff and hotel, Shame about other guests","The customer service from arriving to leaving, was the best I have had in any hotel anywhere, I was looked after with a smile and they were pleasant. The rooms a little hot snd air con not the best so was warm through the night and breakfast was average to be honest. Fried eggs over done and rubbery snd scrambled the opposite, but plenty to choose from, the breakfast room was busy even at 8.15on a Sunday but that is just unlucky as normally be okay. I felt the staff great and the only thing that let’s it down for me would be the obnoxious guests who think they are better than everyone else, a large party of guests checked in thinking they could push my daughter about as they only people on the planet but not hotels fault,",4,2023,09,24
119,Anniversary trip,"We were pleasantly met with very friendly staff , we were also upgraded to a suite which was amazing. As it will probably be our last anniversary as I have terminal cancer and the trip made me feel very special . The whole yacht was immaculate, the suite had bedroom , separate bathroom with two showers, a jacuzzi bath and a sauna, separate lounge area with a dining table , plus complimentary minibar , tea/coffee and chocolates on the table , we had an enormous balcony , even though it was very windy we still had a coffee out there we had aeroplanes going over but that did not disturb our sleep in a very comfortable king size bed . We were local to the excel centre and just a short walk from the cable car which we went on to cross the Thames and allowed us to go to the o2 arena . We cannot fault the Sunborn at all ,staff Accomadation, and the morning breakfast were all amazing and has given us a few more memories . Thankyou ",5,2023,09,23
119,Birthday trip ,Beautiful yacht. Staff were amazing. Nothing was too much trouble.  Food was great. Good selection of drinks in the bar.Rooms are clean and well presented. Great location. View is incredible across the Thames. Definitely recommend.,5,2023,09,23
119,Luxury stay at reasonable rates,Amazing hotel on the water and even got a free upgrade to a room with a balcony. Very clean and the bed was very very comfortable and massive. The rooms were more than amicable and very spacious. The breakfast in the morning was absolutely amazing and very good value for money.. ,5,2023,09,21
119,Fabulous stay with a WOW! factor,"This was our first visit. A real one-off place to stay with a wow factor. Getting there is ok - Elizabeth Line Tube to Custom House then a 5-minute walk via Excel. Had a standard room was very big, clean and comfortable. It had a sofa and huge bed plus air conditioning. Staff were all very cheerful and friendly. Good breakfast in the morning: a buffet with lots of choice. Fabulous views of canary wharf, Docklands, the cable car from the open back deck - especially when it's dark and you can see everything lit up. Drinks are expensive and a service charge of 12.5% is automatically added. But that's to be expected in a London location as good as this. We will be back.",5,2023,09,19
119,Great Venue but not great for food intolerances,"On arrival, the hotel reception definitely has the wow factor.  We had a riverside balcony room and the views were beautiful and the room was a decent size.
The staff were lovely but unfortunately the bar was very short-staff which left the lovely bar server extremely over-worked and flustered.  We did wait a fair time for drinks.  There seemed to be more staff later on in the evening just before the bar closed.  My biggest gripe is the lack of options if you have any food intolerances.  I asked for a gluten free menu and was told that look at the menu and avoid anything with gluten! So my food choices were very limited.  Not the standard you expect when you are in a fine-dining restaurant. My husband and I shared a cheese board which was £17.  When asked for gluten free crackers and I told they don't have any and was offered a slice of bread. My main (chicken) was £28, my husband main (lamb) £39.50 so definitely not a cheap meal.  I feel they should be able to have a gluten free menu or at the very least, gluten free cracker.  2x mains, 1x shared cheese board, 1 x bottle of pinot + 12.5% tip and our bill was just under £150.00.

119,Sheer luxury on the River Thames!,This was my first visit and stay at The Sunborn Hotel and I loved it. I really felt like I was on a small cruise ship that wasn’t going to go anywhere and the cabins/rooms were wonderful. The staff were very friendly and helpful making checking in and out seamless. The food was delicious. Sipping a G&T on the outside bar/deck was perfect for watching the sun set and for watching the aircraft going in and out of City Airport. The whole experience was sheer luxury and I’ll definitely be back to treat my husband next time either later in the year or the beginning of next year.,5,2023,09,16
119,Anniversary Treat,"Took my wife for a special treat on our first Anniversary, WOW! Just as you enter a beautiful reception welcomes you with lovely large chandler gives grand gesture on arrival!

Had river view which made extra pleasant, good size room with lounge area.

Drinks on the terrace was nice, good selection of cocktails etc.

Food was simply amazing ! 

Staff were freindly, approachable, couldn't do enough for you.

Would highly recommend a visit here, and no doubt we will return some day.

119,Sunborn Hotel 4 1/2 Star - Should be downgraded to a 2 Star,"The bed was a futon on a bed base With no mattress , no sheets over the top, makes one wonder how clean the futons can be? The coded keycards only worked when they felt like it. The breakfast had overcooked and very salty sausages and bacon, the scrambled egg had only just about seen the heat as it was runny (undercooked) and left us with tummy problems (we are sure you will get the picture). The toilet roll was so thin a pack of rizla papers would have been thicker… We stayed here last year and it was very good, don’t know if they have changed cooks and suppliers because this time it was rubbish and put us off staying there again!",1,2023,09,11
119,Gone downhill !,"We went to the sun borne bar for cocktails before going on somewhere else I have been here before and even stayed the night and been so pleased with everything but ! This visit was a disaster the service was horrendous I went to the bar twice to see if we were going to get served after 15 minutes we were asked what drinks we wanted when they arrived they were the wrong drinks they then came back with 1 drink that was right and stayed they only had warm beer the type my husband had asked for ! He then got a different beer was given just a bottle with no glass ! Several people walked out because they got fed up with waiting, the tables weren’t clean there was food and napkins on the deck ! I won’t be going back which is a shame but it’s gone downhill so much since my last visit !",1,2023,09,10
119,Only stopped for a drink,"We were walking past and as we were dressed very casually weren't sure whether we could pop in for a drink but we were welcomed without issue.

The bar area is lovely, we sat outside on the deck and it was really lovely, with views to the O2, Canary Wharf and the cable cars.

Drinks are a bit pricey but it's expected. 
Would love to visit again, perhaps for afternoon tea next time",4,2023,09,10
119,"Amazing Location, Hotel on a Yacht, what more could you want.","Stayed for two nights on a recent visit to London. Amazing Location and Views.

Excellent customer service, we had travelled overnight and gave us an early check in when we arrived at 7am. 

Breakfast included in our booking, large portions and tastes great. 

Executive room with all the extras you need, fridge, ironing board and iron, slippers and dressing gown. 

Comfy bed and amazing nights sleep with built in air con in the room.

Hot shower and very clean bathroom.

119,Nice location,"Great location with easy reach of central London. Good transport link. Walking distance to the cable car, the O2 and the Elizabeth line. Nice big and clean room. Staff were very friendly and helpful. Nice breakfast and bar area looking over the river with views of the 02 and cable car. Will definitely go there again.",5,2023,09,08
119,One Night Stay whilst attending the NTA's at the O2,"We booked an Executive King Room with river view, which included a small balcony. We arrived early so made lunch reservations whilst our bags were stored with the concierge. Great decision as lunch was wonderful. We were initially greeted by Syreena at reception and she couldn't have been more lovely and helpful, even taking some photos for us by the chandelier.

Our room was spacious, spotless and very comfortable. So convenient for the DLR station just a few hundred metres away too. We will most certainly be back and can thoroughly recommend the Sunborn as a unique and wonderful experience. Thanks again Syreena.

119,Lovely stay ,"Booked for my hubby’s 50th birthday , paid for ballon package. They added chocolates extra. 
nice large room , very quiet . 
Staff friendly and helpful  
Breakfast plentiful , could of done with being a little warmer,  ( have reviewed direct to sun borne)",5,2023,09,03
119,Great hotel in the docks,"Excellent and unusual hotel on the water! Rooms are large and comfortable with great views of the docks and city airport. Breakfast was plentiful with plenty of choice. great location from London centre via the Elizabeth line.
Would recommend!",5,2023,09,03
119,"***DO NOT RECOMMEND STAYING HERE*** Dated, awful customer service, smelt of sewage and broken aircon","We stayed here for the first time for my husbands suprise 40th birthday treat. I booked the romantic package. On arrival the receptionist told me we had been upgraded to a room with a balcony and gave us our keys. When entering our room the decor was very dated and the carpet stained, and no balcony! Just a sealed cabin window. When I went back to reception I was told they were fully booked for the night and we couldn't upgrade. OK, so why tell me we had been then?! Room was very warm and air con broken, told multiple times it had been fixed but it wasn't and didn't get fixed the duration of our stay. Sleeping in a room of 25 degrees and no way of opening a window for some fresh air wasn't comfortable. Bed was decorated in plastic flowers and 2 swans made of towels, very tacky! On morning of departure the yacht stunk of sewage which was disgusting! Have made a complaint regarding all of the above with customer relations and the matter is still not resolved 3 weeks later as they do not reply to emails! Awful customer service!! I've asked for complaints contact details multiple times and been ignored. Defo would not return of recommend staying here!!",2,2023,09,01
119,Excellent,"Had a lovely stay at the hotel.  The staff was very friendly, professional and helpful.  The room was lovely and clean.  The yacht was clean and is beautifully decorated.  Five stars from me and I certainly would stay there again. ",5,2023,09,01
119,Very relaxing and luxurious stay,"Booked an Executive River View room for my mum's birthday through Wowcher which was an excellent deal. I did try and change the booking date as my mum had an operation that turned out to be major, but they would not allow a change to the date.
We decided to travel and stay anyway and I was able to drop my mum off at the front of the yacht. 
We were greeted by a very friendly reception team and checked in quickly.
The room was lovely with fabulous views over the River Thames and Docklands. The beds were very comfortable and the bathroom facilities were good. The coffee machine didn't work which was disappointing but I'm sure I could have got it changed if I asked.
We had drinks in the bar behind reception and ate there in the evening. It was busy but staff were very attentive. The cost of food was reasonable, but drinks are expensive.
Breakfast was amazing, lots of choice and staff reserve your table while you are getting food. Full English breakfast available as well as continental, juices, tea and coffee. 
The gin bar was closed for a wedding which was a shame as I would have like to have visited - next time!
Parking is available at the Excel Exhibition Centre next door at £25 for 24 hours and only a 5 minute walk away. ",5,2023,09,01
119,Disappointing ,"I booked an overnight stay. I had called to request to change the date due to unprecedented circumstances but they would offer no flexibility or help as I booked with a third party. I contacted the third party and they said it was up to Sunborn to amend the booking. Someone wasn't being truthful. 

The phone didn't work in the room to contact Reception. We had to ask for slippers as there were none in the room. Luckily I saw a housekeeper in the corridor and asked.

The bathrooms are not shown on their website which is pretty poor form. It was incredibly small and not very clean (mould). The shower door didn't close properly and the toilet seat was unstable. Very dated bathrooms. 

The dinner was really lovely and the waiter (I think he was in training) was very kind. Yet, breakfast was very hectic, noisy, and the tables were shoved as close together as possible which made the environment rather unpleasant. I was eager to leave the breakfast room. 

When checking out, they didn't bother to ask how our stay was or anything. Just took the keys and said goodbye. 

Overall, I was disappointed with our stay and not sure I would choose this hotel again as I feel there are others in London with better value for money, a better environment, and much friendlier staff. ",3,2023,09,01
119,What a find!,"Oh my goodness, what a find! Absolutely loved this hotel and the free upgrade to a balcony room was a bonus! Would stay here again in a heartbeat. Such a great price for a London stay with breakfast included (which was fab). The staff were so lovely and even looked after our cases after check-out so we could have a wander before catching our coach back home 🥰",5,2023,08,31
119,Absolutely loved the experience,"Absolutely love this hotel! So different to any other, lovely decor throughout, the rooms the so spacious, and the staff are so helpful and friendly. The views from the bedroom is stunning, would highly recommend. ",5,2023,08,30

119,Great hotel providing you don't want to drink at the bar.,"Excellent room. Very big with good view.
Staff friendly
Lovely views riverside.
Only downside is cost of drinks in bar. One and a half pint of Coca Cola cost over £17 including service. 'Silly' money. Wondered why bar was so empty in evening, yet hotel clearly had high number of guests when compared to breakfast time.
Breakfast was pleasant and plentiful.

119,“Perfect birthday treat”,"We had a wonderful time on this beautiful yacht, when you look through the photo’s it is exactly as they show.  The rooms are beautifully clean, the bed extremely comfortable an amazing nights sleep. 
The breakfast would be the only little thing, unfortunately the plates are cold and by the time you sit down the food is only tepid but nonetheless beautiful and they also had an amazing selection of cut fresh fruit along with cereals and pastries etc. 
The staff were all polite , courteous and nothing was to much trouble, we will definitely be going again when we next come to London. ",5,2023,08,28
119,Absolutely Amazing,"What can I say, the most perfect and truly magical stay in the amazing yacht that is the Sunborn.

Pure decadence!!!

All the staff were very professional, kind and efficient and always had smiles on their faces!

Huge shout out to Amara who made our stay so memorable.... thank you!

Cabins are spotless, beds and pillows extremely comfortable. 

Breakfast plentiful and varied and of an exceptional standard.

Location is fantastic  very close to stations, cable car and uber boats.

The very best stay in London!!!
Thank you Sunborn Yacht.",5,2023,08,28
119,Definitely be returning,"Booked by my husband as a surprise.. fab location and fantastic yacht!! We had a balcony room which was very spacious and had everything you needed for a weekend getaway. 

Only downside was the chairs on the balcony are far to small… can not see over the balcony to see the lovely views.
And there wasn’t any promotion of the champagne and gin bar. If we hadn’t of stumbled across it we wouldn’t have known about. 

The staff were all great but we have to give a big shout out to ‘ fortune ‘ he was such a gentleman and so helpful.. great guy 👍",5,2023,08,27
119,Very dated decor,"Well... I have to say I was very disappointed. Not only was the ship extremely dated. The cabins were very basic. I was expecting luxury. And it really isnt. The food though is very good, and the cocktail list. But very expensive.. would I stay again. NO ",2,2023,08,27
119,Beautiful memories on the Sunborn,I went with my daughter a few days ago...the experience and the staff were so kind and friendly..especially the receptionist Lizzie who helped me find disabled parking directions via the phone on the way there and once we entered she helped us upgrade to tge Executive Suite with a river view..loved every minute of it...clean and spacious:),5,2023,08,26

The hotel is beautiful , lovely friendly attentive staff as always . Definitely recommend this hotel. Looking forward to staying again next year .   Thank you for another great stay .",5,2023,08,22
119,Lovely unique hotel with a grand feel to it.,"Had a lovely stay on the yacht hotel, the staff were very friendly and helpful and the room had a grand feel to it, it was a nice atmosphere and the surrounding area was nice if you fancy a stroll around, unfortunately only a night for our anniversary would of been better to stay at least a couple of night so can make best use of all the restaurants and views.",5,2023,08,21
119,Beautiful Yacht Hotel,"Was treated to an afternoon tea for my birthday. When I looked at the hotel online decided to book a night as it looked so plush & unusual. Parking for us was ideal as I have a disabled badge, there are spaces by the boat & they are free, however, normal parking isn’t far away either. Check in was easy - we paid an extra £10 to book in 3 hours early. 
We had an Executive Riverview cabin with a balcony. Really good size with huge bed & luxurious looking wooden furniture. Had a handy fridge, tea & coffee making facilities & a nice sized balcony overlooking the water. 
The shower room was fine although a little dated but had everything you needed. 
The yacht is moored outside Excel building with plenty of shops & restaurants nearby & not far from the O2 & cable cars so very convenient. 
Afternoon tea was good. Plenty of choice & too much for one sitting. Also get a cocktail. The restaurant is very nice along with the stairways & chandeliers. Staff were friendly & very helpful when we requested some changes. 
The restaurant is very pricy but then it is in London. We chose to have room service - a chicken Caesar salad & burger which came to £38. It took a long time to arrive but it was Friday night so we should have ordered earlier. 
Breakfast was buffet style. Good choice again although like most hotels had the toaster set up so it’s either raw or burnt! Food good but would have liked to be served teas/coffee at least
Check out easy except for one of the lifts was broken. 
In all it’s a beautiful & unusual hotel and we’d definitely recommend a visit. It’s expensive but not compared to most London hotels.",5,2023,08,20

119,The Sunborn Hotel.  A great experience for staying somewhere different in London,"Arrived to hot sunshine, the boat looked elegant in the docks.  The decor is what you would expect on a boat and spotlessly clean, i could not spot any dust on any of the ledges.  We were upgraded to room with balcony which was lovely and everything in the room was lovely.  The bed was very comfortable so had a very good nights sleep.  I'd like to have gone in bar but unfortunately our evening arrangement took us to the west side of London and we did not get back till bar closed at !!pm",5,2023,08,18
119,5 🌟 fabulous hotel ,"Loved this hotel and the location, Spent two nights at the Sunborn yacht hotel, absolutely beautiful lovely  clean hotel, ,room was huge, bed comfy, when we first arrived and went into the room we opened the balcony doors and there was a very loud noise looked out and realised we were directly under the flight path for London city airport we thought oh no! Close the doors and never heard a thing and at night no noise at all, we had a very relaxing and peaceful stay,  breakfast was excellent a good selection and fresh, (the pastries were gorgeous) 
The staff were lovely and very helpful.
Would highly recommend this hotel ",5,2023,08,17
119,Well done Sunborn London ,"Check in quick and easy, the room we had was beautiful, we were on the first floor, breakfast had everything you could want they were constantly topping everything up, what we had to eat was lovely,no complaints about anything was a nice break away and would definitely stay there again, well done Sunborn London ",5,2023,08,17
119,Sandy Lane on sea ( nearly ),"Wow what a place I cannot fault this floating hotel, staff, food, position everything is all good. I booked this fast online with no real thought so I didn’t expect much and I’m not a boat / yacht person. However I am now. They throw in the breakfast which is amazing where others charge you so if you consider this then the price is fair.

119,"Great experience, so glad we went","We stayed at the Sunborn in Royal Docks and what a great stay ot was. Staff were so proffessional and so polite/welcoming.the hotel is breathtaking with beautiful scenery especially at night. We stayed in the riverside view room and was definately worth it.the room was clean and quite spacious ( more than i expected). The only constructive critism was limescale in the bathroom and side of bed slightly torn ( this did not spoil our stay).
I have  stayed in many hotels and can honestly say any request was immediately dealt with( the quickest i have experienced).
Breakfast was acceptional, plenty to chose from. Amanda one of the staff at breakfast was really smily and happy to help answering many of our questions. We felt nothing was too much!. 
I would love to stay again and cannot wait to go back!!!!",5,2023,08,15
119,Delightful different experience,"We chose this hotel, for something different for a theatre break, We liked the size of rooms, and the included buffet breakfast, the local was not as difficult to access as the Elizabithan line stops at custom house nearby  and there cable car and DLR are both a short walk  away. Staff were very friendly and helpful.",5,2023,08,13
119,Food Poisoning Alert with Dreadful Service!!,"My two daughters recently celebrated their 21st birthday at this ‘hotel’ and both had food poisoning, probably from the lobster.  They left the table before dessert and couldn’t attend breakfast in the morning, nor did they get to drink the cocktails they paid for.  The hotel were notified at the time. They offered to call an ambulance but have refused to offer any sympathy, compensation or apology!!  They were prepared to conduct an investigation after the event with a company who advertise that they do their upmost to protect the reputation of their clients (i.e. the hotel)!!   Good luck with your booking!!!",1,2023,08,11

119,Stunning Location with top notch service,"Absolute stunning location , wonderful service, delicious food and cocktails to die for. 2nd stay for us and I have no doubt there will be a third. Rooms are as good as they look in the photos too! Our teenage daughter fell in love with the place. ",5,2023,08,08
119,Great hotel!!,"This is a really great and really different hotel, something a litte unique.
The rooms are lovely, clean and spacious, with everything you would need for a comfortable stay.
The public areas are decorated to a high standard and the staff are very friendly and professional.
We had dinner and breakfast during our stay. The dinner was very nice with great service, a la carte standard.
The breakfast was a little busy and chaotic, but it was peak time on a Sunday morning, so to be expected really.
The yacht is situated in a great location, great for the Excel or the O2 especially.
I thought all in all it was great value for money, and I would definitely stay again, and recommend to friends and family.",5,2023,08,08
119,A really unusual place to stay. We loved it!,"We had a really enjoyable stay last night. Our room wasn't quite ready when we arrived and the lovely lady on reception sorted us out with a drink at the bar whilst the house keeping team finished up. We were really impressed with her pleasant and friendly manner and the way in which she dealt with the issue.
Our room was lovely with a river view. Spacious, comfortable and very clean. People have moaned previously about the dated decor but it was fitting for the yacht and in very good condition.
The views from the sky lounge and the bar on floor 3 were fab.
Breakfast was very good with a nice selection of different foods. We went at 7 and it became quite busy but tables were spaced out.
A very enjoyable stay. ",5,2023,08,07
119,Dinner bed and breakfast package ,We booked an overnight dinner bed and breakfast package for my husbands 65th. It was amazing and a great experience. Unfortunately our room wasn't ready when we checked in but we were immediately offered complimentary prosecco in the bar. After about 10 mins the staff member came back to advise the room was still unavailable but they upgraded us straight away to an executive suite with balcony. Couldn't fault the attention we were given/ nothing was too much trouble and staff went above and beyond. The food was amazing/quick service and attention to all details. Sunborn is clean/friendly and we would definitely recommend it to anyone that wants something abit different. Top marks!,5,2023,08,07

119,Simply amazing time.,"From start to finish, this was a great stay.
So easy to get to on the tube and even though it was raining, most of the walk was covered.
Check in was easy and hassle free and the room was perfect. 
Everywhere was clean and tidy from the room to the public areas. Was apparently fully booked but didn't feel ""packed"" or crowded.
Food in the restaurant was amazing, breakfast was certainly more than adequate with plenty of options all round. Drinks options were fantastic and well worth it throughout the stay.
Staff were all polite, helpful and happy.
Amazing place itself and a fantastic location with everything you would want in easy reach.
Superb and will 100% return.",5,2023,08,07
119,Best experience ever,"Great hotel with amazing views.  Comfortable room, amazing breakfast.  Staff at reception and the bar were friendly and helpful. Met one of the managers, Amara Fouade who was very pleasant and helpful. He encouraged me to come again and tell my friends about this excellent hotel.",5,2023,08,07
119,Easy to get to and from,"Get here easily in all manner of ways. Initially booked as unique and luxurious option but feared we may be a little far from the city centre. However it is so easy to get to, wherever you want to be there’s an easy option. Elizabeth line drops you at their door (Custom House station) from many stops, Tottenham Court Road is only 5 stops away. DLR from the same station takes you to the Tower of London. Alternatively walk across the adjacent footbridge or catch the cable car to North Greenwich pier for an Uber boat to the London Eye pier. So many easy choices and many more along the Elizabeth line and Uber boat to choose from. The Sunborn yacht hotel is lavish, even standard double rooms are spacious and everyone was very helpful from maids to reception to bar and restaurant staff. ",5,2023,08,06
119,Sunborn hotel stay,"Stayed here with my teenage son for a London sightseeing trip. On arrival we were greeted by very welcoming staff. On booking in we had a lovely surprise of a room upgrade which gave us a balcony. The room was immaculately clean, had a fridge and tea coffee making facilities. Nice bathroom with heated floor, hairdryer and toiletries. Dressing gowns and slippers provided also a lovely touch. We ordered food which was good quality and reasonably priced, the seating area is lovely with views across the water. Breakfast was a buffet style english breakfast, cereal, yogurt, fruit and a choice of pastries all good quality food and fresh juices tea and coffee. This hotel is beautiful there are 3 decking floors in which you can relax with a drink and admire the views. I’d definitely stay here and again and would definitely recommend.",5,2023,08,06
119,Nice place to stay,"Review

Warm welcome at reception we checked in early so we left our bags and went out.  Returned at 2.45 pm and our room was ready.  We had room 2019 junior suite on 2 nd floor the room was big and very clean but shame about the balcony when you sat in the chair you could not see over the balcony just a view of metal.  I would suggest a river view not a dock view room.   No wine glasses in the room but water in fridge and tea/Coffee making facilities.  Bathrobes and slippers and toiletries replaced daily.  Some of the furniture and walls were marked and needed attention.  Our room key constantly did not work which meant we had to return to the reception.  
- [ ] We had breakfast at 8am and it was not busy but by 8.30 am it was much busier.  Plenty of choice at breakfast of hot and cold food but I did feel the hot food was dry the eggs were very over cooked.  There should be an option to have eggs freshly cooked.   The staff were all lovely  and attentive.  The hotel has 2 bars one on 3 floor and one on the top deck which serves gin and champagne.  However they only offer one gin.  Drinks are expensive and they add service charge of 12.5 percent.  A bottle of sparkling wine  was about £44 with service charge.  The decks are nice to sit out on if the weather is nice .  Recommend walking around the docks there are lots of street food vans we had a pizza one night on an old double decker bus it was fun.  Get the cable car over to the 02 £12 each return.  We walked up and over the arena which was great fun you need to book in advance.   But the arena has loads of restaurants inside and shops so worth a walk around . We also went to the ABBA arena one night to watch the show it was about £7 each way in a taxi .  We used Uber as they were the cheapest option. The tube station is literally on the door step of the hotel.  On check out we left our bags and called back later for them which was an added bonus.  I’m glad I stayed as it was different however I feel the hotel needs to address the little things like marks on the wall and marks on the furniture and perhaps fresh milk in the rooms for tea etc.

Buffet breakfast was plentiful and fresh but sausages a little over cooked both days that we stayed.
We were given a free upgrade which was beautiful to a junior suite with a balcony.

119,Great stay,Went to the Sunborn London luxury yacht for Afternoon Tea and a one night stay. The afternoon tea was perfect. The service was friendly and efficient and they catered exceptionally well to my food request. Setting for our tea was perfect overlooking the River Thames with views of Canary Wharf and the O2. Great transport links with Customs House Elizabeth Line/DRL station just a 5/10 minute walk away. Cabin was really nice. Bed as comfortable. Breakfast in the morning was excellent. Would go again and have no hesitation in recommending the Sunborn.,5,2023,08,01

119,Great over night stay!,"Delighted with my stay onboard the Sunborn, firstly it's good value for money, we had the overnight stay with dinner and breakfast and then we also had the afternoon tea! all of the food was above average, well presented and benefited from good attention from the serving staff. Our room was very nice indeed, very tidy, clean and in excellent decoration it really did feel like a luxury yacht cabin although like so many hotels I wasn't comfortable with the pillows but perhaps that’s just me? If you can get a deal on-line then it’s a good break to take! Between meals we strolled around the docks and could have taken the cable car to the O2 shopping mall but we chose drinks on the sun deck instead!",5,2023,08,01
119,Superb stay at the Sunborn Yacht Hotel ,"My opinion is that this was a superb hotel 
that lived up to my dreams and expectations. 
The welcome was super fast and very friendly and helpful. 
The room was massive and very luxuriou.  A TV, a sofa, tons of cupboard space, mirrors everywhere and excellent lighting.   Also plenty of plug sockets.  Very comfortable bed.  Complimentary tea, coffee, water and biscuits.  
There are also Complimentary toiletries and a shower cap.  As well as a small vanity box with a nail file and cotton wool etc.
The cleanliness is of a very high standard. Spotlessly clean.  Everywhere in the hotel. 
The communal areas are bright, spacious and very close. 
The boat is very luxurious and a wonderful treat.  Beautiful views throughout.
Then there was breakfast.   There was a choice of cooked, toast or rolls, pastries, fruit and cereal.   Also smoked salmon and cheese etc.  Tables are not too close to each other.   Food was plentiful. 
Staff everywhere were so nice and friendly. 
Overall a very wonderful treat and would I visit again? Absolutely! I very much recommend it.  If I was giving out awards, this yacht hotel would get the top one.
Thank you to all the staff for a wonderful treat. ",5,2023,08,01
119,Loved my yacht hotel experience,"I loved my stay here, the room was like a cosy cabin and the bar and restaurant were exquisite. Will definitely stay here again. As would like to experience the champagne and gin bar in the sun! It was too windy for us on our stay ",5,2023,07,31
119,A night on the docks,What an amazing experience. The staff are amazing and friendly and made our stay all the better. The rooms are extremely spacious and probably the most comfortable bed I’ve slept in. Did I mention the cocktails are fantastic. Try the Sunborn and I guarantee you’ll go back. Brilliant.🤩,5,2023,07,31
119,An excellent experience with very friendly and welcoming staff.,"The Sunborn Yacht Hotel is splendid. You must visit it. It's adjacent to the Excel Centre at Victoria Dock in Docklands and easily accessed by the DLR and the new Elizabeth Line.

Inside, the rooms are excellent and very comfortable. We had a dock view with balcony which was great. The central staircase and reception area are glorious and above are the restaurant and sky lounge, both very comfortable and with outdoor balconies looking across the dock to the cable car and O2.

The food is excellent. We had afternoon tea which I thoroughly recommend. We also had breakfast in the restaurant and light bites in the sky lounge. I can say with confidence that dinner would also be superb.

The icing on the cake is the staff. We've stayed at many hotels over the years and hotel staff can vary. At the Sunborn, everyone we encountered was exceptional. They were friendly and helpful, and we felt a strong sense of welcome. So much so that we took time to mention it when we checked out and also on the feedback form.

The Victoria Dock area has become a very attractive place with restaurants, street food and the Cable Car across to the O2, which itself is a tourist destination with many restaurants and outlet shopping even when no event is taking place.

I thoroughly recommend the Sunborn Yacht Hotel. We shall definitely be returning.",5,2023,07,31
119,"Incredible place, highly recommend !","Amazing place. Feels like pure luxury from the lift to your room, staff are incredibly helpful and so friendly, rooms are beautiful, balcony has an amazing view and we were provided with bath robes which was a lovely touch. Very happy and would 100% stay here again. ",5,2023,07,31
119,Very nice hotel ,Very nice hotel on board a beautiful yacht. The room was big and very comfortable. Drinks were a little expensive but you expect that in London. All the staff were very friendly and the breakfast was hot and plentiful. Good location near Custom House tube station.,5,2023,07,30
119,Wow. A brilliant location!,"I took my two grandchildren to London and chose Sunborn for our hotel as I thought it would be fun. Our first view of the yacht was from the cable car. Wow!

The children loved it! We had a family room which was a good size. We were able to see the cable cars which were lit up at night from our small balcony and other lights reflecting in the water!

Breakfast was great. Loads of choices. The staff were very helpful and arranged for my granddaughter to have her entrance/exit avoiding the lifts which she doesn’t like!

Travelling was easy. We used an Uber boat and then the cable car to arrive. Custom House DLR nearby and also the Elizabeth line at Royal Victoria. We tried several routes and it takes approximately 35 minutes to central London. 

I would certainly recommend.",5,2023,07,30
119,Perfect Location  Service of a motorway service station ,"What has happened to the Sunborn Stayed the last few years for events at the ExCl 
This year things have changed 

Made to order breakfast is now buffet style now served with cold plates and the food lukewarm items had been waiting in the kitchen going cold before been put in warming trays.(3 of the 5s flames had gone out so not much warming going on)
Eggs bacon and beans all stuck together.
No saucers for tea and coffee lots of dripping cup’s being carried from the self service coffee machine.

Rooms need updating 
I bath and 1 hand for 2 people ?
Air conditioner so noisy 
No curtains just blackout lining fabric which did not meet in the middle 

No access to the lounge/bar due to a corporate sell out 
So no relaxing afternoon drink in a comfortable chair but you can sit in the breakfast room and be served warm beer as this was not a bar it’s the dining room.

If you are wanting  the service and facilities of the Sunborn as advertised you will be very disappointed.

119,30th wedding anniversary,"My wife and I regularly stay at the hotel just for a night away from the day to day things at home.
This time we was celebrating our 30th wedding anniversary.
Wifey loves this hotel.
One day we will try the sister ship in Gibraltar.
Will return again soon.",5,2023,07,30
119,Great stay at the Sunborn Yacht Hotel,"We had a really lovely stay . Staff were very helpful and we were able to check in early . Room was a great size , bed comfy and we enjoyed being able to sit out on the balcony . Breakfast was good too . We had a great time and look forward to staying again in the future ",5,2023,07,29
119,Great way to see in my birthday ,"Easy to find,  helpful staff. Outside bar was cool, nice views.  The room was a really good size and the bed was so comfy. Also great that you can access Netflix on the TV.  Magnificent large mirror which I loved, and also the comp water as well as a cupboard if you wanted to make yourself a hot drink also with comp biscuits. Had a great time",5,2023,07,29
119,Very poor,Very dated nothing like the ship in Gibraltar very very disappointed & far too expensive for what is provided.  Had I been aware I would of cancelled and booked elsewhere as it was a surprise for my partner.  Lesson learnt will not stay here again,3,2023,07,29
119,Well worth it ,"We had the best time staying on the yacht.  The staff were very polite and service was very good, the food we could not fault.  Our room was very clean we had one with with a balcony looking over the docks.  We will defiantly stay on there again and would highly recommend.",5,2023,07,29
119,"Enjoyable stay , champagne bars policy needs a rethink ","Overall an enjoyable stay . We were given an early check in which was fantastic , the room was immaculate.  The boat is very pretty and the reception staff and lands end staff really good and attentive . I support previous comments I’ve read about the champagne bar . I wanted champagne but my husband is a lager drinker . They would not allow him to bring up his beer to sit with me having champagne up there. Now , when I paid more than enough to stay somewhere I do not appreciate this kind of treatment . People come here to enjoy the boat and it’s social areas . This is the only negative factor , everyone thing else was really good . They are missing out on income, so makes no sense . Easy work for the staff up there as no other custom at the time . ",4,2023,07,28
119,Afternoon tea,"Yacht is impressive and grand reception. Place is spotless and I am picky. Did not stay in the hotel but had afternoon tea with cocktails. Food was fresh, unlimited tea/coffee, great service (especially from Vamshi), great choice. Would definitely recommend and go back",5,2023,07,26
119,Good location and good service,"This was our first time on board and we had a family room with our grandson. The room was fine nice and clean. The sofa bed for our grandson however was not brilliant, the mattress was very thin and uncomfortable. We had complimentary chocolates and water when we first arrived and they also replaced our water for the second day.
All of the staff we encountered were friendly and helpful.
Breakfast was very good with a good choice of options available.
One evening we spent in the bar having some drinks and playing cards and the jazz music was just too loud and it was too much jazz, perhaps a bit more variety is needed.
Location is very good with easy access to the DLR Station ",4,2023,07,26
119,"Extremely disappointing, and far from luxurious, there are much, much better places in London","I can't express how disappointed I was with this hotel.  I literally felt like crying as it was so far from what I expected.  Avid fans of below deck, it's been a dream of all of ours to stay on a yacht.  It's a long trek to central London but thought it worth the hassle as we'd mostly spend our time on the yacht.  Unfortunately there was nothing luxurious whatsoever. There was certainly nothing 5* about it, I've stayed at more luxurious travel lodges!  Service in the champagne bar was dreadful. 3 staff just chatting, not particularly interested, not welcoming. The waitress spilled more champagne on the table than in the glass without an apology we were sat on the deck and not once did they come out to check on us we had to keep going to the bar, they wouldn't let one of us have a beer as it's literally just gin and champagne served up there which seemed a bit odd as not everyone likes gin or champagne and when out as a group that's difficult.  There's no menus or information of any kind in the room.  The toiletries weren't Molten brown but some cheap watery rubbish.  Paid ridiculous amounts for the the romantic and birthday package (don't waste your money!) Not even a card to the birthday boy.  No information given during check in. No concierge service. We arrived early but weren't notified that our room was ready had to go and check.  Breakfast was shocking queued for a table, led to it and left to our own devices no explanation or service whatsoever.  When we found the food most of it had gone. No pastries, no white bread left, no fruit or meat just a bit of wilted cheese.  There was a queue of people with half filled plates waiting for hot food to be replenished. The utensils used to serve aren't cleaned during service so the beans and eggs spoons were pretty gross. It was all very cold, mushrooms inedible, back very thin and stuck together.  The second day was worse so we didn't even bother on day 3.  Because of the food and service we cancelled our meal for Saturday night because I just couldn't cope with any more disappointment.  Our room key stopped working quite a few times so had to go to reception for new ones.  The shower screen was too short and no matter what we did we flooded the bathroom it wasn't a great shower either very high bath to climb into and only a trickle.  The whole hotel was freezing and our room was dreadful literally sat with the dressing gown over my clothes whenever we were in the room.  The dressing gowns were also rough and belt hoops broken which I wouldn't expect in a luxury hotel.  The balcony was pretty disappointing I appreciate it's a boat but it was dirty and had some very cheap plastic chairs on it.  We had a gift delivered Friday night to one of our party but were never notified, upon checkout they seemed confused and explained they had a staff member with the same first name so it had been given to them.  They opened it! Completely different surname and no one thought to check the guest list which seemed a bit wrong to us.  We wanted a night cap on the first night and got to reception to be told the bar was closed and only 2 types of bottled beer were available or we could have wine again this was very disappointing as even non luxury hotels offer pretty much the same menu as the bar.  The only food available was a margherita pizza which again was not really what we expected.  The staff at night and check out were pretty rude too.  It was also annoying that you can't walk around the boat all the stairs are roped off so it's up and down the lift or the back stairs.  Overall I feel like we have overpaid for the entire stay. I would not recommend it. I would not go back.  ",1,2023,07,25
119,"Overrated, underwhelming. Stay elsewhere and AVOID","Where do I start! 
Plus point- hotel most likely caters to corporate clients what with Excel close by. 

Sunborn London is overrated, underwhelming and disappointing. 
The members of staff that attended to us on check in day through to breakfast need professional training. 
The Room-  
Plus point- makes us feel like we are on a cruise ship 
However, the amenities and equipment used could have been better to reflect the price we paid for our suite! 
The room was not cleaned properly. Party balloon evidence on bedroom floor. Room temp was freezing when we got in. Took sometime for temp to settle. TV reception poor( not sure if this is a one off). Told reception but apparently they had similar complaints. 

Reception staff 
When I remarked that the real experience  compared to their marketing material experience on Sunborn is quite a difference, the person at reception made a reference to that of a fast food chain! Appalling! Person said “ you won’t get a burger from Burger King what you see on tv advert”!
I said this is not a fast food restaurant but a hotel. 

Dinner
My husband asked for a 2019 Rioja but almost given a 2020 only because we checked after initial request of a Malbec was unavailable. They do not carry most of the wine list reflected and the price is seriously inflated it’s ridiculous. 
The food was average. I wouldn’t attempt to bite into their old crouton as I would have done some damage to my teeth. 

The sweetcorn soup was mediocre.

Breakfast

Restaurant ran like a take away corner shop. 
Again staff needs professional training in customer care and service. Staff looked sloppy and uniform not uniformed. Breakfast concludes at 10 but staff start clearing and clanking around before 10. Very noisy clearing.  Hot buffet average. Scrambled eggs dry. Food not replenished efficiently. 

Overall - Terrible with very poor service. Staff needs professional training in service and customer handling from front desk, restaurant to  guest relations. 
Do not deserve the acclaimed rating. 
Hugely disappointing as Sunborn Gibraltar was good. ",1,2023,07,25
119,Not great,"came to this hotel for my anniversary and I can say I wouldn't return again unfortunately. 

lets start with the goods/Okays

Staff are friendly, there was a lady who greeted us on arrival - i believe her name was Syreta Wright (I know her surname is Wright as she had the same as my partner) - very friendly, knowledgeable, professional and down to earth. There was another guy who also helped and was friendly but didnt catch his name on the night shift. 

the Hotel is very nice aesthetically and the room sizes were great

Bad

the complimentary toiletries most hotels (even premier inn) give for free you do not get here - there was a very small bottle of shower gel which didn't even lather up, you can tell very cheap. 
when we went for breakfast, the queue was very long and the lady serving didn't know much about what was going on. The food was basic, but we didn't really get try much as everything was pretty much gone!! they took a long time to replenish - somethings they didn't - we went to breakfast at 9:35.

One of the lifts that we were in broke down and the staff member who we told at the time, didnt pay no attention to what we was saying about the lift breaking down. 

overall, I wouldn't spend my money and actively choose to stay here, experience for such a nice look hotel wasnt there and expectations were not met.  ",2,2023,07,24
119,Wonderful stay ,"I booked this as a surprise 1 night away for my boyfriends 50th, I can honestly say I don't understand the negative reviews.
When we walked in we were both like WOW! Check in was easy, room was big (River view) and clean, bed was so comfortable. Staff helpful and friendly.
We didn't eat in restaurant as went to O2 - (we ate at Gordon ramsay street burger - check it out, it's delicious) Cable car is only 5 min walk. When we came back we sat outside on the deck and had a drink, such a beautiful setting. 
Breakfast was buffet style and was very tasty. If you like a good sausage you won't be disappointed 😀
Highly recommended - thanks for a wonderful stay x",5,2023,07,22
119,Wonderful Staff!  This is an excellent and easily accessible hotel. 5 Star and highly recommended!,"Wow! What an amazing experience. We drove to London and were able to park in the hotel opposite the yacht only 60 metres away. The look of the yacht from the outside is impressive with clean metal work and entranceway. Inside it is as shown in the various marketing mediums. The lobby / reception is immaculate. However, it is the staff who make or break any hotel or tourist attraction and the Sunborn have ""nailed it"" with their team on board.  All the staff we encountered were marvellous and chatty.  This translates onto the guests and as a result everyone we met was having a good time. Our cabin / room overlooked the water and the dockside opposite. Looking towards the end of the waterway we could see the Skyway Cable Car.  Looking the other way  you look towards the City Airport. (Despite being very close to the airport, the noise of any aircraft if negligible if the door is closed - and that's coming from someone who lives in the country!).  The cabin and en-suite was immaculately clean - even on closer inspection. The standard of cleaning was exceptional and everything in our cabin was well maintained. (Again, this is down to the cleaning / housekeeping staff!).   To cap it all, one of us had a birthday whilst we were staying and complimentary treats were provided.  We also took afternoon tea one day and that was really enjoyable.  The cost of our stay was comparable to any other hotel in the City and if you are looking for a different type of venue to stay in, which is also a pleasure to return to each day, then we cannot recommend the Sunborn enough.",5,2023,07,22
119,Great service from VAMSHI & his 3 other colleagues:),Many thanks to VAMSHI & 3 of his other colleagues who catered to us during our Afternoon Tea on Friday 21st July 2023 from 12:30). You were all very polite and attentive to our needs. Great service and appreciated VAMSHI taking the time to explain the menu to us and to offer alternatives to any Teas which were not available on the day. Thank you also taking care of my phone when I needed it to be charged and ensuring it was in a secure spot whilst I peacefully enjoyed the overall Sunborn Yacht Hotel and its beauty and the Afternoon tea itself. ,5,2023,07,22
119,Fabulous Afternoon Tea and Great Service! ,The afternoon tea is lovely and the options are great and tasty. Thank you to Vamshi for being a super helpful and attentive as our host! Would definitely be back for a great experience overall and trying something new!!,5,2023,07,21
119,Excellent one night stop over,"Lovely hotel. We were only there for one night but would have loved to have stayed a bit longer. Very relaxing, spotless clean accommodation. Very friendly, helpful staff. Breakfast was self serve buffet style. All very fresh and hot with a good selection. Our weather was good so we were able to sit out on the decking area and enjoy the views. Definitely recommend.",5,2023,07,18
119,They care more about Corporate Clients & Groups than their individual guests,"We travelled for one night stay in June 2023, a midweek stay - what a mistake!
The hotel catered well for their corporate events onboard, as we were told at check in that deck 3 & 5 were not usable due to large group events and the bar and restaurant was now on deck 4. Once we had unpacked we went to sit out on the terrace on deck 4 for a drink, as the weather was sunny, only to be told that the outside space on deck 4 was also reserved for a group until 6pm! so we decided to get off the boat and go elsewhere for a drink prior to our dinner reservation.

After dinner and drinks, we requested a coffee, only to be told the coffee machine was broken because it had been over used at the corporate events and it needed a clean!

To top the evening off, my husband was ill which we believe was due to the meal that evening onboard the boat.

On check out we had a meeting with the Manager, he seemed to take our complaint seriously and filled out the necessary form because of my husband's illness. I explained that they should inform customers if areas of the boat are out of action due to corporate events, as we would have rescheduled our booking.

I've had to chase the Manager a couple of times for a response which is unacceptable, and to date we still have not received any compensation or offer of a discounted stay as promised. 

The stay was completely spoilt by corporate events taking place, and as this was not a cheap hotel, we don't feel this was value for money at all, in fact we are left feeling cheated and would not recommend this hotel to anyone.",1,2023,07,17
119,Not Great at all....,"I was asked by this hotel to leave them feedback after our stay at the Sunborn Hotel in London. As it was a terrible stay I left my comments in the hope they may do something to rectify it. But unless you leave good reviews it seams they just do not care....My one night stay goes as follows:

On arrival at 8pm there was a full on private  party happening near to the reception area. I don't mind a party but the whole hotel doesn't need to know about it. Could hardly here the receptionist when checking in. hey ho.

The room was tatty, had scratched floors, the dirty  linen wasn't great either.
The aircon didn't work on night when it was very hot and sticky, (no Windows could be opened I must add) so had a terribly night sleep of sweating in an uncomfortably hot stuffy room. We had to call for towels as one hand towel  wasn't enough for the two of us to take showers.

The breakfast in the morning was unedible, the scrambled eggs looked like vomit, cold and tasteless. The bacon was shredded for some unknown reason and the sausages were cheap and overcooked to death. Remember this a four star hotel in London not a Diner in some back street.

This Hotel is not cheap at  £240 a night so was somewhat annoyed with our stay as mentioned above.

The hotel have offered me a discount on a future stay but I don't think we shall be going back anytime soon.

Unfortunately the hotel has not investigated any of my points, had they done this then maybe I would see them in a different light.  They have repeatedly ignored emails asking for answers. And when I do get a response they take no responsibility at all. 

Very poor stay at a very poorly run hotel...sorry

",1,2023,07,17
119,A really underwhelming experience,"We stayed at the Sunborn for our first anniversary - and it was really underwhelming. The check in staff were a mixed bag - the 2 ladies were friendly and professional, but another member of staff was very curt and not at all accommodating. 

The hotel has a room service menu but don’t offer a room service breakfast - which is strange! When asking one of the front of house team, they snapped back. 

The bar was very expensive (which is expected) but the selection was also underwhelming. The table service was slow and unnecessary. 

I paid extra for the romance package which was nice, but I expected a box of chocolates, not 5 on a platter.

The coffee machine was awful - the hotel uses unbranded pods which don’t work very well. We would’ve been happier with instant coffee. A previous guests hairpins were still on the side. 

The curtains didn’t shut all the way and had holes in them, so we were woken up by sunlight. 

There is no in depth information about rooms - I wish we upgraded the room (again) to have a river view and not the romantic view of the Excel. 

There are no printed materials in the room - everything is on an app.

TL;DR: A 4* hotel without the 4* experience - the small details could be more refined. ",3,2023,07,16
119,A glimpse of luxury!,"Never stayed on a yacht before!  Was slightly dishevelled from travel however warmly greeted by reception team.  Cabin glorious, beautifully clean and tidy, well maintained with more than sufficient supplies.  
Food offerings main dining room.and/or room service; close enough to TfL stops for evening travel.  
Dinner was incredible with proper service from well trained staff, diverse menu for an a la carte evening; breakfast included - all very generous portions and well cooked/presented.  Expensive but worth it for a treat. ",5,2023,07,15
119,Enjoyable stay,"Me and my boyfriend and I had a lovely stay. I don't understand all the negative comments about breakfast. We thought it was lovely. We couldn't check in early (it quite clearly states that check-in is 3 pm, so why are people moaning)? Reception though took our bags and checked us in so when we returned in the evening we just had to collect our keys. Rooms are slightly dated, but very comfortable bed and good shower. We will return. It is also easy to get into central london as Elizabeth line is 2 minutes away. 5 min walk to cable cars, too. ",5,2023,07,14
119,Unique experience,"Booked a one night stay directly with Sunborn as a surprise for my wife. Paid for the Executive room package which included dinner and breakfast . Good points: unique experience, food very good , perfect location for exploring London , tube just across the road . Negative points: for an executive room I was expecting more , in fridge just two little bottles of water, nothing else, at dinner I was told by waiters that if I wanted the fillet stake or lamb , I would have to pay an extra £8 for each one, that’s totally wrong as I pointed out that this isn’t mentioned on menu or any of my confirmation emails, eventually they took the charge off and finally they said that we weren’t entitled to the free glass of Prosecco each, again I had to show email that stated we were entitled to it so eventually we got them , very unprofessional. On conclusion I’d say it’s a nice experience but done it once and don’t think I’ll go again . Entrance is via two lifts but when it’s busy it’s a nightmare to get in or out, could do with a different entrance option",4,2023,07,13
119,A four day stay which should / must have been better without having points to complain about concerning room & breakfast,"Concerning the room:
Although the room was upgraded to a bigger one (with an extra charge per day) and it was spacious, there were a few problems:
a) The Aircondition did not work (although according to the technician it did). Then howcome the generally accesible rooms and floors are more colder than the room itself? Before I left the room, I have closen all the windows, doors etc and put the aircondtion level to maximum ventilation and coldest possible temperature and after returning to the room several hours later, it still had the same temperature. It is not really a sollution to put manual extra ventilation into the room..... At the reception I was told that they could possibly give me another room, but there is absolutely no gurantee that the airconditioning is going to work.....
b) The coffee maschine (where you have to put in capsules to make your coffee) half of the coffee was flowing into the cup and the other half was flowing into the container where the capsule is deposited into, after it was used.
After several interventions (for 2 consequtive days) at the reception, they have brought another coffee maschine (which is also showing to some extent the above mentioned problem) and brought some manual fans into the room - this did not really solve the problem of the AC.

Concerning the breakfast:
Although the breakfast is available until 10:00 am, at round about 9:40am they do not continue to fill up the buffet -> an early bird gets more than someone who comes later for the same price.
On the first day I have asked for scrambled eggs to be done for me as I have a lacotse intolerance -> First question was ""What is lactose??"". Secondly, they have brought me the acrambled eggs, but with milk inside which I only noticed later, i.e. when I was already having the reactions to the lactose.... Such a case is on the border of negligent bodily injury...
The used plates are not cleared from the tables right away -> staples of used dishes and cuttlery on the tables.....
It takes about 15-20 minutes to bring two 3-minute eggs and two hard boiled eggs....
By the buffet, the allergents in the meal are not declared (fully) -> one has to ask for everything....
When a table is prepared for the next ""guest"", the bread crums are viped onto the floor, so you have to take into consideration that you are eating your breakfast while bellow you where you are sitting, the floor is full of bread crums etc...
There are not enough alternatives for vegetarians or for those who want to eat vegan or for those who have a lactose allergy. i.e. no lactose free cheese, butter e.t.c.

119,30th birthday stay,Beautiful cabin room in quiet area with lovely breakfast. Very clean and a lovely stay. Would recommend for a unique place to stay in London. Great price. Will take bags if you arrive early before check in time.,5,2023,07,12
119,2 star hotel…,"We got here in the morning with a small child, and there was no possiblity that we get a room before 3 pm… I am sure there were some rooms free, as it was not fully booked… but the good will was just missing.. 
2. the coffee machine in my brothers room is not working.. they promissed to change it… two days ago… but nothing happens…
3. and last but not least… the breakfast is the worst… not only is the cheapest that you get… no quality at all.. but also , if you come at 9:40… there is hardly anything left.. as we asked, the answer was that they only fill up till 9:45- although breakfast is till 10am, and according to the law, all of the guests pay the same for breakfast, so it is mandatory to have everything filled up till till 10am… 
They said , there is still something on the buffet… 
4. not talking of the dirt under the table, and the towers of used dishes not taken away… ",2,2023,07,12
119,Brilliant stay,"Had a fantastic stay on the boat as a gift, easy to get to right next to the Excel by under ground, station 3 minutes walk away or take the cable car over the Thames from the O2. The area was very tidy and very quiet for being in London. The staff were very friendly and helpful and our experience was made even more pleasurable by being ungraded to a mini suite.  ",5,2023,07,10
119,The opposite of an Ultimate Luxury Experience,"I could imagine this being an absolutely amazing hotel, however it falls short in so many ways, it really is just a floating Travel Lodge.

Given we only spent about 15 hours on board, the amount of issues we encountered was poor to say the least.

Arrived early & was told we couldn't check in until 3, we asked if we could have 1 of the rooms slightly early as we were going to BST at Hyde Park to be told this isn't possible as the duty manager has to check every room, not sure how they could check 50 plus rooms in a 30 minute window before 3, however we were reluctantly given a room at 215. I do get 3pm is the check-in time, but given how quiet it was this shouldn't of been such a drama.

In the meantime, we had lunch in the bar, the woman serving was great. However, not sure why she had to take orders, serve drinks, take food orders, deliver food & also clean tables whilst 4 staff on reception were doing next to nothing. This led to an obvious 20 min wait on drinks & orders, again not the girl’s fault, more a staffing issue.

When we arrived back in the evening my wife informed the girls on reception that someone had been sick in the ladies & it was everywhere, this was met by a FFS from the receptionist, obviously i can't type exactly what that is, but i'm sure it obvious. Now who on earth thinks this is the right way to conduct yourself in front of a paying customer? Luckily we're quite liberal couple & just walked off to the bar. Again, another staffing issue in teh bar area, 1 hour to get 1 round of drinks.

We then went back to our room, and for 4th time the card wouldn't work. This then took 15 minutes to get another so we could get in our room.

As per previous reports, breakfast is a disaster. Buffet which really is only big enough for a 20-room hotel, not a self-proclaimed Ultimate Luxury Yacht. This resulted in yet more waiting & food that was distinctly average & lukewarm.

For a stay costing over £275 for one night, this is such a disappointment, certainly can't see us stating here again unless they sort quite a few issues that make it anything but the ultimate in luxury.

119,‘Luxury yacht’ I think not - more like a sinking ship.,"Once you take away the novelty aspect of being on a yacht, you’re left with a very average 3 star hotel. 

We arrived on Friday afternoon and had a drink in the bar before venturing to our room. The reception staff were hit and miss in terms of their friendliness. 

The room was nice and novel, if a touch tired, and did include some useful items such as tea and coffee making facilities, hair dryer and ironing board and iron. There was plenty of storage for clothes. 

The bathroom however was not clean and there was visible mold on the wall. The bath mat was disgusting. The extractor fan did not work which caused a problem as there were no opening windows in the room so nowhere to ventilate. 

We wanted to allow the hotel the opportunity to atone during my visit, rather than moan retrospectively on a review forum, so I informed the reception of the problems with the cleanliness and lack of extractor in the bathroom. Duty manager John was a good man and offered an alternative room but as we needed to go into Central London that evening we weren’t left with enough time to change rooms and get out in time. I suggested a reduction in the room rate to make up for the sub standard experience and John said he was unable to do this and I would have to wait until Tuesday to speak to a general manager. Bearing in mind the room was circa £200, even a 10% discount as a good will gesture could surely have been authorised by a duty manager but alas no. John did recognise that it was a special birthday for my wife and sent up some Prosecco for us which was thoughtful by John himself but did not remunerate me for the lack of facility. 

We went to breakfast just before 10am knowing that it went on until 11am leaving us what we thought would have been plenty of time to enjoy a leisurely breakfast. Unfortunately there was a 25 person deep queue waiting to be seated when we got to the restaurant. In fairness it only took about 15 minutes or so to get to the front of the queue but it was reminiscent of a holiday camp or similar and not somewhere that masquerades as a ‘luxurious’ (see front page of their website).

I was incredulous to be presented with a sign stating that you could only dine for 45 minutes and then afterwards you had to ‘…return to your room…’ I actually found this hilarious as I’d never been to a hotel where they gave you the ‘prison bang-up’ theme after breakfast but I guess that’s what this ‘luxury’ hotel thought was appropriate. 

The breakfast itself was average at best. The selection of pastries was small, the eggs were poorly cooked and the tea and coffee facility was found next to a very busy conference room. 

Unbelievably a female member of staff interrupted us eating our breakfast to remind us that we had to leave after 45 minutes. In fact my wife had her plate cleared and was finishing off her tea to be pounced on by the same woman asking if everything was ok and whether we were about to go. 

Now in fairness due to the moderate wind, using the copious breakfast tables out on the deck was not an option hence having too much demand for the inside tables. This ultimately is not the problem of the customer and is a reflection on the poor logistical management of the hotel. 

Finally I never received any contact from a general manager. I left unfavourable feedback on the hotel’s internal feedback form and received and email from Raul Labrador (unsure if real name) saying they were sorry to hear my less than favourable feedback and would offer me a discount when I stay next time. I asked for elaboration but have heard nothing else. It’s irrelevant as I have no intention of returning. 

In conclusion £200 is reasonable for a room for a night in London in June, but make no mistake all of the marketing in the website and glitz of the reception can’t hide a poorly run hotel with little care for the quality of experience of the guests. 

If you want something special avoid this place.",2,2023,07,07
119,Amazing stay on a beautiful luxury yacht.,"Wow what can I say I took my husband for a birthday suprise stay and short break in London. This was our first time staying at the Sunborn Yacht in London. 

If you are contemplating booking a stay here just do it you won't be disappointed,it's amazing. I booked a double room and on arrival were delighted to discover we had been upgraded to a balcony room. The view from the Yacht is fantastic, in the evening you have a city view with the city lights as a backdrop. 
The bed was very comfortable with soft pillows best night sleep. Room was a good size with dressing gowns and slippers supplied. Coffee machine and chilled water provided in the fridge. The breakfast was delicious with a good selection of food and drinks available. The area around the yacht is lovely and quiet, there is a Tesco express nearby if needed. Direct access a few minutes walk to the Elizabeth line that takes you directly into central London. 

There is an airport nearby but it didn't affect our enjoyment of our stay. The staff are very friendly and welcoming throughout the whole stay. 
Will definitely book again - Thank you Sunborn Yacht London ",5,2023,07,07
119,"Beautiful place to stay, makes a change from the norm","We’ve just returned from a lovely stay on this beautiful boat.
Nice clean and spacious cabins, bathrooms need a slight upgrade, but beds are really comfy, air con is efficient, balconies are great, TV is good, amenities are good, clean rooms with a lounge area too. 
Location is easy to get to from the Thames Clipper boat at the Royal Wharf Pier about a 10-15 minute walk, or get a taxi to drop you off opposite. Parking available near by but to pay for. 
We ate in the restaurant as part of a prepaid deal and the meal was fantastic, 3 courses which included salmon starter and fillet steak main, all done to perfection.
The bar area is spacious and lots of places to sit including outside. 
I would stay a again, check around for offers, which are often cheaper than booking direct.",4,2023,07,06
119,Loved the experience,"Loved it.  Great location.  Beautiful ship.  Clean and spacious authentic ships cabins.  Verandah view on riverside is well worth the extra cost.  Breakfast was adequate and well prepared.  Does become congested around peak times.  Staff do their utmost to keep the wait down.  A great place to relax.  All staff are very welcoming, friendly and efficient.  The dock has a few interesting features to explore and some good restaurants and shops.  It is excellent for visiting Excel and within easy reach of rail and bus transport.  City airport is also nearby.   Hopefully we will return and will be recommending the on board experience of the super yacht.  ",5,2023,07,05
119,Good but no Cigar,"My wife and I had a great stay onboard for a special birthday celebration. The rooms and views are stunning and we received a warm welcome from the staff at the reception but unfortunately it went downhill from there. We waiting ages to be served for drinks and ended up having to go to the bar ourselves and the most disappointing factor was the breakfast. It was simple not acceptable for a hotel of this price range, The buffet was akin to a Premier Inn but not as good (whoever cooks your eggs needs to be trained properly) There was a long wait in a queue and we were surrounded by dirty plates as there wasn't anybody clearing the tables.  This really let down what would have been a lovely stay.",3,2023,07,04
119,We enjoyed the second time with even higher comfort,"Even better than the first time.
We booked a Family room with dock view. This has been the best decision. The room had been quiet besides the separator door on opposite side our room door. Room-Service cleaned up on a daily base.

The breakfast was rich and well presented, and was used in self service.

Hint for Sustainability: Towels should not be changed on a daily base. Let your guest decide to go for new towels (used ones on floor) or not (used ones on hangers).

We will return next year.",5,2023,07,04
119,DO NOT WASTE YOUR MONEY,"DO NOT WASTE YOUR MONEY

This place is overpriced and very basic and I would not recommend this place to anyone. We stayed to celebrate our 30th wedding anniversary and to say it was a disappointment, is an understatement. 

Firstly, I believe their staff require training in how to greet people. We have stayed in a lot of hotels over the years and even though we are people of colour and some can be shocked that we are enjoying such facilities, we are normally greeted professionally and people manage to hide their shock. Not in this hotel. We were made to feel as though we needed to be ushered out of the reception as soon as possible less anyone realised that a black British couple were staying at the hotel. It was really quite ridiculous.  

Secondly, the room smelled bad, and my husband had to kill 8 flies before we could settle down. We were unable to open the windows to let air in. Also the floor of the room had not seen a mop or any sort of clean for decades it seemed.

Thirdly, the standard of the finish in the hotel was very dated. I know it is only a four-star but I really felt as though I had woken up in the 80's. 

Fourthly the food served in the restaurant was overpriced and basic. Not only that but we had to battle to get a booking. When we tried to ring through to make a reservation, no one took the call. So we sauntered off to reception and even the receptionist could not get through to the restaurant which resulted in her cackling like a fishwife to the staff upstairs who finally took the booking. We were told that the restaurant was full but if we had dinner before 6 pm they could fit us in. So we took the booking only to arrive at a completely empty restaurant which did not start filling up until about 8pm when we were leaving. Would it have been so impossible for them to have accommodated us at 7 pm as we had requested? Then after all that to have substandard food was an insult.

Fifthly the breakfast was cold and virtually inedible. They appear to employ staff who do not know the basics of customer service, rude, and disinterested, this was the norm.  

In any other hotel if I had told them it was my 30th wedding anniversary I would have received a gift perhaps flowers, a bottle of champagne or a bowl of fruit given that I had chosen this hotel above others. Not from this hotel, we received nothing but a skanky-smelling room full of flies. They are not a four-star hotel in my opinion they are about a 3 if that and they are overpriced when after all they are just providing over processed food from 'Chef Mike' (i.e. the microwave). They are missing an opportunity to be fabulous because of the location, but they cannot deliver. Ths is a joke of a hotel and I could not possibly ever recommend anyone to stay here. I am a business owner myself and if I had an offering like this, I would hang my head in shame. Customers deserve much better than they offer here, so don't waste your money. It is a depressing and overpriced place to stay.",1,2023,07,04
119,Beauty and the Beast,"There is no doubt that the venue is every bit as beautiful as all of the pictures available online. The beast therein is the inconsistency of some staff in applying good, basic customer care. Am fairly certain I had my room downgraded from that described in my booking and although breakfast is included, I have eaten better at a Holiday Inn. On the plus side, it's easy to access using public transport, can use the cable car to get to North Greenwich and it's fab if you are attending gigs at Docklands. A very different type of hotel with rooms that don't have thin walls! Enjoy your stay!",4,2023,07,03
119,Good experience,"Ideal location, nice big comfortable cabin, helpful staff,
Only fault was the coffee machine didn’t work in the room.
Otherwise it was a very enjoyable stay, location is good with public transport close by to reach all parts of London.",5,2023,07,03
119,Nice food,"Very nice welcome aboard. The rooms were dated but clean. The bed was solid, but pillows and bedding were very comfortable. We ordered room service which was prompt unlike the bar. The service in the bar is very slow and it wasn’t busy, just us and another couple or two, the whole stay. The bar also has no atmosphere, even a little background music would help. One very unprofessional member of the team was swearing at her colleague behind the bar although I believe she worked on reception. The food was absolutely amazing and actually made our stay the 4 stars Iv rated it. It’s pricey but it’s london and we prepaid for the whole experience anyway. Could do with someone checking the communal toilets more regularly, the floor was covered in toilet paper. All in all it was a nice stay but if the food hadn’t of been so good I probably would have rated it a two. ",4,2023,07,02
119,Disappointing….,"Super vessel and unique place to stay. Nice rooms. Told x3 rooms would be together sadly not just Same floor. Service in bar was poor, tables dirty and staff were either new or poorly trained. Tried ordering drink more that once and was up going elsewhere. Very sad, had expected so much more. No attempt to put anything right which is a real shame. Would we come again, probably not :(",3,2023,07,01
119,A great place to stay,"Lovely comfy rooms great service a lovely breakfast, great location. We have stayed a few times and it never disappoints . It would be lovely to have entertainment in the bar in the evening. Would definitely go again",5,2023,07,01

We will definitely be back again!!
Thank you Sunborn!",5,2023,07,01
119,A unique location but very busy.,"Great location but far too busy. If I return it will be at the weekend when there are no or fewer conferences on. The venue appears to cater for company/business meetings and some areas of the boat are cut off from paying visitors. Felt we should have been warned about this on arrival.
I suppose being adjacent to the Excel Centre I should have realized beforehand.",3,2023,06,30
119,Above and beyond the expectations,"Had a lovely one night stay, my room was kindly upgraded by Cosmo who gave me all the support via phone before my stay.
Once there we did enjoy some Prosecco on the lovely terrace bar before our check in time that was smooth despite the hotel was busy due to an event.
The suite we stayed in was clean the bed and the pillow super comfy.
A special thanks goes to Raul, the front office manager who was there to welcome everybody, ready to support and making sure we had the best experience.
Thank you ",5,2023,06,29
119,Beautiful yacht,"I booked this for my husband’s birthday, i thought it was something a bit different and it definitely was! 
The yacht itself is beautiful with an amazing chandelier staircase. It’s in a great location with the cable cars taking you over to the o2. 
Our room was lovely, nothing too amazing but comfortable. We had a river view and was definitely worth the extra cost. 
Staff were polite, friendly and helpful. 
Only downside was the restaurant was fully booked so we went out for dinner. We found a fantastic Thai restaurant just by the cable cars, highly recommend that too! 
We both had a lovely enjoyable stay.",4,2023,06,28
119,The superb Sunborn Hotel London,"The whole experience was 1st class from start to finish, and the staff were so accommodating and helpful. From the minute we walked in, to the time we checked out, we were treated like royalty. The room we had was something else, it was huge, with a balcony big enough to hold at least 100 people, with the lounge equally as big. The bedroom was very spacious and spotlessly clean  with every amenity you could wish for. Two people I'd like to thank for making our stay so special, Navadeep, excellent waiter/bar person, and Euridice head receptionist. Although, everyone deserves a mention, they made our stay extra special.",5,2023,06,28
119,Great experience,"I treated my daughter to a night on the Sunborn before spending a couple of days in London.  The location is great...close to the tube and buses and great for walking along the river. We walked down to the Skytrain (cable car) and crossed the river to the Greenwich peninsular, had a walk around the dome, got some street food and took photo's of the yacht and the river as the sun went down. Everything on the Sunborn was spot on. The staff are friendly and helpful, the room was spacious and clean and the breakfast choices were great.  The air conditioning was very welcome on one of the hottest days of the year!  Highly recommended.",5,2023,06,27
119,Immaculate ,"Immaculate hotel and presentation, very quiet and a comfortable nights stay. If driving do your research beforehand in regards to parking. There’s plenty of places to park your car but it helps to book early. 

The staff were extremely helpful and friendly, I highly recommend! ",5,2023,06,26
119,Excited for the experience but poorly executed,"Lovely location.  Yacht is tired and run down. Rooms are old fashioned and could be cleaner and modernised. 
Service has not been the best. Went to the bar and the waiter who was lovely had to ask a senior member of the team if we were able to take wine bottle to our table in the restaurant? Should not really be a question, as he should have just offered to take it plus we ended up pouring our own wine!

Service in restaurant, not asked if we would like any water?  In our package a glass of Prosecco was supposed to be offered but we had to ask for this?

During the starter and the main course we were not asked if everything was ok? However food was lovely. We had also had an empty bottle of wine at the end of the starter at this point and was not asked if we would like another. What a loss of revenue. 

Disappointed to say the least. What a shame.",3,2023,06,26
119,Amazing ,"Booked online as a Birthday surprise for my partner, never stayed here before so was a little unsure but having read the fantastic views went ahead and booked a cabin. A few days later having read that I could have a room with a balcony I upgraded.

Upon arrival and checking in the receptionist said that he had upgraded us as a complimentary gesture, he went in to say that we have the best view on the ship. I was a little baffled and thought that the receptionist meant that he could see that I had upgraded from my initial booking.

Oh my gosh having travelled up in the lift to the 5th floor and entering our room “ WOW” we literally had the best suite on the Yacht known as the wheel house. We had a very nice accommodation which led into another part of the suite which was the front of the yacht with views all around, we also had the entire front deck area of the yacht exclusively to ourselves which words cannot describe,  upon further inspection we noted a note saying “please help yourself to the contents of the mini bar fridge on us” it was packed with bottles of lager, wine, cans of soft drinks, bottles of bottled water and a range of packets of crisps and peanuts.

I can honestly say it was the best experience ever, each and every member of staff were so friendly and helpful, nothing was too much trouble. We had a sit down meal on board at the restaurant and again the food was amazing.

A huge thank you for the amazing upgrade and to thank all of the staff aboard you are a huge credit to the Sunborn.

We will most definitely be staying again

The room was fantastic we had a dock view and it is in a good location for a lot of venues the food was lovely we had breakfast and dinner in the evening ,5,2023,06,22
119,Something a bit different and therefore special,Great location if you are visiting Excel - couldn't be closer and it feels a bt special to be staying on a yacht hotel rather than the usual concrete blocks!  The room was lovely overlooking the dock with great views from the balcony and the bed was comfy (apart from the pillows that were lumpy).  Good price too in comparison to the nearby Ibis and Novotel.  Will definitely stay again.,4,2023,06,22
119,Well impressed!,"An excellent 2 night stay. The rooms were clean, bright and airy. Staff pleasant and helpful. Food and drink prices very reasonable for London. Too far out if you’re wanting the main attractions in the centre of London but excellent for ExCel events. ",5,2023,06,19
119,Lovely Hotel but get the right room ,"Unique hotel, very comfortable good sized rooms, great views from decks, good breakfast.  Disappointed though that the picture of the ""Classic"" room (Secret Escape site) was far bigger than the one we had.  Also just a single small (1 metre by 1/2 metre oval porthole) window rather than the much bigger one shown giving no real view or much natural light.  Felt a bit cheated otherwise would have given 5 stars. ",4,2023,06,19
119,Great,"This was our third visit to the sunborn, this time to celebrate my birthday, check in was super fast. It was a extremely hot day so we decided to have drinks on the deck, where despite the heat all of the bar staff were helpful, friendly and hard working, a gentleman called Fortune went above and beyond to look after us, he really made it special. The room was clean & had everything we needed. breakfast had a good selection and again great staff, I cannot fault this place we love staying here and hope to visit again one day.",5,2023,06,17
119,Unhygienic and dirty,"At arrival we were extremely happy with how welcoming each staff member was. The yacht was beautiful and when we entered it did take our breath away how amazing the inside was. This never lasted long due to us finding stains all over the bed sheets and a dead fly in the bed. We brushed this off and didn’t want to make a fuss. However when it come to us having a shower we found dried blood on the towels/ robe. Now that is unacceptable! When we complained to the receptionist she was amazing and gave us the relevant emails etc to take it further. A week on from me emailing I have not received any emails or calls regarding this complaint. It has not been acknowledged at all, we are extremely unhappy and disappointed. For the amount we paid we did not expect to find these things, well and truly disgusting and unhygienic!!!",1,2023,06,17
119,MONICA IS GREAT!!!,"Monica from restaurant was amazing. 5 Star service!!! Called her up and had 110 questions for her and she responded to each one with a big smile... Dont see many people nowadays giving this level of service.

119,Birthday stay,"We visit London periodically to see shows at the West End and have never stopped this side of the city. Given the special nature and reasonable cost of this hotel decided to give it a go, especially as it was my wife's birthday.
The location is easily accessible as the new Elizabeth line has a station at the Excel centre so  is only a short walk away.
Check in was delayed as they had a system failure but once checked in we went to our room which was clean and especially roomy ( given normal London sizes ) with good air conditioning. The bed was massive and comfortable, as were the pillows and the bathroom facilities more then adequate with lovely fluffy towels. The room on the 1st floor had river views and was quiet.
The ship itself is impressive and breakfast was in the dining room with spectacular views over the docks and towards the O2 arena.
Breakfast was buffet style with fresh fruit and hot options and of a good standard. All the staff were friendly and helpful and we felt there was a good ambience throughout our stay here.
They only loose one point as the bar was poorly stocked and did not have some of the drinks advertised on the menu.",4,2023,06,15

119,Unbeliavable experience.,"This hotel is truly unbelievable.
Its unique.
To be in the city of london on a yacht is amazing.

Tia and the reception staff were so lovely when we checked in .
The place is spectacular.
You can sit on the deck overlooking the water.
The rooms are spotless.
The bathrooms are lovely with soft towels and nice toiletries.

The bar/lounge and restaurant are superb.

We asked the barman NAVADEEP  for an ice bucket for our room.

He said tell me your room number.
Sure enough when we returned to our room there it was with 2 glasses and some chocolates also.
A really nice touch.
The breakfast was fantastic and relaxing overlooking the water.

You dont have to stay on the yacht as there are restaurants and bars within 200 mtrs of the yacht entrance which is palatial and lovely to come back to all lit up at night..

Weve booked again as we loved it so much..

Thank you so much to all the staff for making our stay so special.",5,2023,06,13
119,Amazing!,"Wow, this was the best experience we have ever had! Firstly we were greeted by the lovely receptionist who had upgraded our room to the exec suite which was beautiful! All staff were brilliant. Breakfast is beautiful! The yacht itself is out of this world, it is so beautiful and clean. We felt like we were on a cruise ship, it was so quiet and peaceful. Its so luxurious. The area itself is very slow paced, we didnt feel like we were in london! It was exactly what we needed and more and i didnt want to leave. ",5,2023,06,11
119,Birthday Celebration,"Had an absolutely wonderful birthday celebration for our daughter on the Sunborn Yacht, we booked an Executive Family room on the Sunborn, right from booking the accommodation which is very straightforward to arrival and check in which was very pleasant and professional . the Sunborn is a very beautiful super yacht, scrupulously cleaned and maintained throughout, run to a very high standard by professional and polite people. the accommodation was very spacious, and to a high standard, to have a balcony overlooking the thames is quite a pleasant experience, we used the bar facilities for both pre dinner drinks ( We had booked to dine off the Sunborn  - but will definitely dine on board next time ) and then used the bar for late night drinks, the service and drinks in the setting of this hotel is something to enjoy ( as the bar was very nearly full with just a few seats available ( Testament to the quality of this accommodation )  we booked the B&B option and the food was both plentiful and honestly delicious. additionally as it was our daughters birthday we booked the celebration package, Balloons banners and a birthday card was waiting for my daughter which made her day, all in all I would recommend this stay to anyone, the experience of staying on a super yacht and celebrating a special occasion is something i will do again, I am certainly looking forward to booking another stay on this very beautiful yacht. I would rate this as a 5 Star experience for sure, Excellent accommodation, drinks, food, location and staff who care about their customer's experience.",5,2023,06,08

Thank you to all for making our day so special from welcoming us, to dinner and drinks ",5,2023,06,08
119,Event catering is poor (at a push) but well intentioned,"I attended an event in the hotel and was assured that allergies would be catered for. I was provided the menu in advance (and should have questioned allergens at this point, so that’s on me) but assumed a “vegan curry with coconut milk rice” would be a safe gluten free option. Not quite sure what on earth they’re doing, but apparently their rice contained gluten! 

The venue is beautiful and staff friendly, but on a warm day it became rather uncomfortable temperature wise and drinks (including soft drinks) were few and far between for the environment.

To be fair, I was offered food to be prepared (hence not being too brutal in my star rating) but did not have confidence they could cook something appropriate (gluten in rice?!); I instead went to one of the vendors in Excel which provided me with more confidence (?!?!?!) that they understood allergens.",3,2023,06,07
119,Luxury,"The height of luxury in a superb location (great for plane spotting over London City) and with good transport links. The sparkling central staircase makes you feel like you're on the Titanic and although our room was basic, it was spacious & clean, with a lovely view over the river. The bathrooms could do with an update; particularly since the ship is docked and no longer needs the 'typical' cruise ship suites. My reason for one less star is because the breakfast wasn't great; cold, soggy, no order, although things did seem to be being replenished regularly. Otherwise, we'd recommend a stay here.

Amazing stay it was I'm sorry to say didn't get the name of the man who actually came down to us because we couldn't find the entrance to hotel where we would take the car in..he was so lovely...
Everything was amazing apart from the bed was not as comfortable at all wanted to ask for a change but just left it.
Didn't like the breakfast much the hashbrowns were oily and the fried eggs were hard.",5,2023,06,06

So much so that i am planning to come back for my husbands birthday party . I cannot fault the 5* hospitality of this hotel. Thankyou Mr michael tobi for your excellent service!",5,2023,06,05
119,Not the great experience I wanted it to be…,"I had high hopes for this trip reading recent reviews but I have to say my experience was really underwhelming to say the least and ended up being a bit disappointing.

First off I had contacted the hotel three days prior to our visit to upgrade to a balcony room as the weather was set to be lovely so thought it would be a nice touch for my boyfriend as we were celebrating our 10 year anniversary. I also mentioned this to the call handler along with paying the additional £50 per night upgrade fee. 

Goes to check in and none of this has been cascaded to the front desk. It literally is such a careless mistake, it just started the trip off badly, the receptionist tried to ask me for a further £50 to upgrade but once I showed her all the correspondence she made a discreet phone call to someone who okayed it and allowed me the upgrade that I had already paid for with no extra fuss. The receptionist then asked if we were celebrating this weekend. Communication at its best… so nothing has been cascaded down. Not the best start.

The room we had (5026) was ok. Dated furniture and basic amenities. Honestly, Not worth the price tag - I have stayed in far far cheaper hotels and experienced far superior rooms. 
Two of the plugs didn’t work. There are loads of European plug sockets which I couldn’t get my head around? I really really wanted to be wowed and it was akin to a travelodge where decor is concerned. 
Location is good being right on the new Elizabeth line at Custom House so you are only 10 minutes from the centre of everything.  We drank at the bar on two occasions and got charged a ridiculous 14% service charge to have two singular drinks brought to our table. It is absolutely ridiculous in this current economic climate that the hotel not only chooses to charge £15 upwards for a cheap glass of wine but to then add on a charge for literally carrying it to your table? This really needs looking at, I will always reward good service. But being forced to pay is not a good look. 
I think unless you are desperate to stay here as I was initially -  I would perhaps reconsider and spend your £300 per night in another establishment. Talk to your comms team, it’s the easiest thing to get right and might prevent more lacklustre reviews.",4,2023,06,04
119,Amazing experience ,"A wonderful birthday experience with attentive staff and wonderful food to match. Words cannot describe the experience, it is something that was so special and wonderfully unique. This is definitely a place I would highly recommend. ",5,2023,06,04
119,Amazing,"The whole ship was amazing what an experience, highly recommend excellent part of London not a busy as town centre which was very nice 
We had a complementary upgrade and chocolates left for wife’s birthday, truly amazing hotel room amazing ",5,2023,06,04
119,Love it,"Love evey minute . The yacht is beautiful. The room wad spacious.  The bed is comfortable.  The staff are lovely.  Location is great.  It is near to the O2 and the London cable. I miss it already.
I would just ask for vegetables at  breakfast. ",5,2023,06,03
119,Best hotel for the area ,"We have stayed here quite a few times now .We have stayed  at the other dock lands hotels the Crown plaza and Novotel and The Sunborn is by a far the best . It is excellent for the ExCel centre .This time it was to see Elton John at the O2 and we were just a little worried about returning on the evening but not a problem.  Taxis/ Ubers  all know where it is , the tube station is also only  2 mins away . Location aside . The yacht itself is fabulous. The staff cannot do enough for you and are so friendly. The beds are maybe the comfiest I’ve slept on in a hotel and the pillows the fluffiest .It is very secure and surprisingly quiet . Once inside your cabin there is no noise from the corridor or surrounding rooms at all .   
If driving here I would take the hotel’s suggestion of using the ExCel centres parking . £25 for 24hrs and quite secure with cctv .

119,Afternoon tea,"My husband had booked us an afternoon tea here.
We arrived a bit early but they seated us straight away (we sat outside as the weather was gorgeous). We both got a cocktail followed by the tea stand and a choice of tea or coffee. The food was delicious and the staff were very attentive. There was no rush for us to leave either. Would definitely recommend here. The hotel looks lovely too and wouldn’t mind staying here at some point in the future.",5,2023,05,30
119,Best hotel in London - 11/10,"Getting to the hotel was really easy, we took the skyline to get across the river from North Greenwich station. It’s a short riverside walk to the hotel after that. The hotel is situated in a lovely spot on the Thames, conveniently right next to the ExCel Centre. We arrived at 11:30am and were able to store our bags there until our check-in at 3pm. Giusi was warm and welcoming, and we enjoyed talking to her while she helped us put our bags in safe keeping. It was a great introduction to how lovely and incredible everyone at the hotel is.

We came back at 3pm to check in and were told we’d had a complimentary upgrade to a suite. We couldn’t believe our luck! Every inch of the suite was tidy, spacious, and gorgeous. We were so happy with how wonderful the room was that we spent most of our time there. We were also amazed at how quiet and peaceful it was, especially as MCM Comic Con had attracted large crowds outside the ExCel. Our hotel room was the perfect retreat from our busy day there. It was so easy to unwind the very moment you stepped into the hotel. We spent a large amount of time sitting outside on our balcony, we couldn’t get enough of the beautiful river view. We were treated so well by everyone that it felt like a holiday abroad in the comfort of London!

The morning was lovely and we enjoyed coffee from the machine provided in our room as we sat on the balcony. Everything in the stocked mini bar was free so we had biscuits with our coffee before heading down to breakfast. The food was lovely, and we made sure to have a bit of everything! particularly fans of the scrambled eggs. Overall it was easy to head down, get a table, and start eating, no fuss, a hearty breakfast, and a good amount of time to eat, pack, and check out. 

We were pleased to see Giusi again as we checked out, and had a lovely chat. Her, Sureeta, and Uliana were the lovely ladies that took care of us during our stay. They were very committed to making sure we were pleased with everything, and we were charmed by their enthusiasm and engagement. 

We left the hotel buzzing and wishing we had booked more than one night! We will definitely be back.Thank you to everyone at the Sunborn for making this truly memorable experience possible. ",5,2023,05,29
119,Summer evening dinner,"We were gifted a voucher for the restaurant. It’s was a beautiful day and we had a table with an incredible view. The food was 1st class, we loved everything we ate. Good service too, but there was a mix up with our reservation when we got there, it out a slight dampener on things but was quickly resolved.",5,2023,05,29
119,Stunning hotel. Amazing staff.,"We had the most amazing stay. The hotel is stunning - oozes luxury. The terraces have wonderful views of the city of London. Our room was spacious, impeccably clean, comfortable and such great quality. Every single member of staff was so friendly, helpful and efficient. I think The Sunborn Yacht Hotel London is my favourite place to stay and I will definitely return. Thank you to all the staff for a truly special stay.",5,2023,05,25
119,Great experience ,"Lovely experience on this yacht. We booked the restaurant and having read some slightly negative reviews we weren’t sure what to expect, however we could not fault it at all. The food was to a very high standard but what stood out was the friendliness yet professionalism of the staff. We weren’t rushed and they were on hand whenever needed but remained discreet so we could enjoy a relaxing evening. Special thanks to Abdul, Sanjeeb and Oula who made the evening for us with their friendly , attentive service ",5,2023,05,22
119,Amazing hotel,"Excellent hotel
Amazing rooms, staff excellent 
Could not find fault with this beautiful hotel
Thoroughly recommend this hotel for a London stay
So close to station and cable car
We will definitely be going back",5,2023,05,20
119,Impressive venue but a few niggles,"No disappointment with venue . Stunning yacht . Impressive interior and warm greeting from the staff . 
Told it was an upgrade but we had paid for an executive room so not sure what the upgrade was . 

We enjoyed a lovely hot lunch on the deck in the sunshine . Perfect . 

But the next morning ?!?!?!

Self service . Not my choice - especially for the price but Breakfast was understaffed and could not cater for the numbers . Admittedly it was 9am but no seats no crockery , no cutlery ,no eggs and the worst bacon I have ever seen . 

No fat cut off at all . Obviously thrown into a large pan and tossed like a stir fry . 
This left many slices uncooked and all were curled up and a MESS. 

Please change or remove .

Breakfast brought down the review from 5 to 4 star . 
Please consider the review and also background music . Thank you .

Yes we will return with fingers crossed .",4,2023,05,20
119,Met my expectations.,"Check in was great and our room was upgraded. Our room was on the 5th floor which was very clean and spacious.
We didn't have dinner but breakfast was really nice. there were hot and cold options and if you found the right spot- the view was amazing.
The location was nice with a variety of restaurants and transport options.
I would recommend having some music playing in the bar, restaurant and lounge areas on the yacht.
I have wanted to stay on the Sunborn for years and it defiantly met my expectations.
",5,2023,05,18
119,"Great experience, will be back again!","My partner and I stayed for 1 night on the 14th may to celebrate our first anniversary I booked it as he had wanted to stay here for some time after discovering it on a work meeting in the building opposite. From the minute we entered the reception area it was clean, presentable and just stunning. The receptionist Guiseppa who dealt with our check in was nothing but amazing, she was very pleasant and welcoming and even upgraded our room to an executive cabin for free for our anniversary so thank you very much for that. The room was presentable and clean, would say there were a few minor things but that’s just because we are very OCD and spot things but nothing that affected our stay or were even serious at all. We didn’t eat in the restaurant as we went out and had lunch early and was too full. But next time we will defiantly be trying the food as the menu looked amazing with a decent amount of options on there. Also we want to say a thank you to Ashna, Maryna and Fortune in the bar area who were nothing but accommodating, friendly and hospitable. They made our evening very enjoyable and a memorable one and we will defiantly be back soon. Also thank you to all the other staff we met and spoke to they were all great. Only downside is we didn’t stay long enough ",5,2023,05,17
119,Lovely night away,"We visited with friends we had a Lovely river view room with balcony, hotel was very clean rooms were lovely with dressing gown and slippers provided we got the cable cat over to the O2 for dinner so can’t comment on the restaurant but breakfast was lovely would definitely return ",5,2023,05,13
119,Beautiful accommodations but do not eat the food!,"Very sad stay and hard to believe! I now realise that one reviews when either very good or very bad and in this case it was very bad. All started so well, reception was lovely, friendly and helpful, upgraded our room without us asking and the room was just lovely - I was very happy until dinner then it all went downhill! To order, once seated, took ages, I advised that I didn’t eat pork and ordered the scallops, I asked yet again to make sure there was no pork as the dish contained ham, the waitress just didn’t understand and kept trying to tell me that scallops are fish! The dish was just ok, my husband had the soup - just tasteless! Then came the main course, I had the lobster pasta - big mistake it was so beyond overcooked that I just couldn’t chew through it, it took so long and so much effort plus the sauce tasted just wrong that It was not edible. I eventually called over a staff member to tell them (because nobody came to check if everything was ok) then they offered something else, when I politely refused they left the dish in front of me, needless to say, the smell was just too much and I ended up rushing to the toilet to be sick, when I came out it turns out one of their staff had followed me to the toilet. I thought my tummy had settled and then had a chocolate desert - again just disappointing but not awful. I was surprised that they still charge us for my husbands food and my drink and starter even though I had sicked it up, at this point we just paid because I wanted to just go back to the room and recover. The manager was put out because I had not complained soon enough! When I came back from the toilet followed by his staff member he just kept saying yes it’s overcooked but fresh, why did I not say something sooner - tbh it was because to get their attention was just too much effort and they did not once come and check if the food was ok at any point until I was sick. I went back to the room and had upset tummy all night, next morning tired, hungry and face had swelling with blood spots because I had been vomiting so violently that we went for breakfast and would you believe it, hair on the egg! I did not even make it back from the table from the buffet (no it was no my hair - short hair and mine is long) I just handed my plate to the waitress, pointed at the hair and went over to sit at my table (ended up eating breakfast from Costa coffee) the waitress said nothing, after a few minutes when nobody had come over to me I asked to speak with a manager, she came over and the waitress had not even told her about the hair! The manager had to go and check! Can you imagine how many people are reporting these issues and nothing is being addressed! Honestly so beyond shocked 😳 

I would say that I have also stayed at the sun borne in Gibraltar and the food there was great so this experience was a real surprise to me.

I would stay here again but never would I eat the food! Be warned.

Also, we stayed one night and checked out on Thursday, we were told management would contact us in the coming days, it’s now Saturday, still not heard anything as yet!",1,2023,05,13
119,Fabulous 👌 ,"Just fabulous from start to finish.  Attentive Staff.  Room was luxurious and spacious, bath towels lovely & fluffy.  The whole experience was really great.  Plenty to see and do surrounding, go on the cable car!  Easy to get to by train, thank you xx",5,2023,05,12
119,AMAZING SUNBORN STAY,"Absolutely stunning hotel in a great location. Tube and DLR within 5 minutes walking distance. Staff all amazing, really helpful, polite and attentive. We loved the room and found the decor really suited the whole yacht experience. It was totally spotless, warm, beds extremely comfortable and totally silent. once in your room you can't hear anything. Lots of different lighting around the room and plenty of home comforts like a kettle, ironing board ,t.v ,free bottled water and biscuits. The only thing you do need to take with you is a European plug adapter. Would highly recommend and the breakfast was delicious too with a very great selection from hot cooked breakfast, cereals, fresh fruit, pastries, etc and they cater for different intolerances too. It only takes about 20 minutes on the tube to get into city centre.The bridge next to the ship is featured in the Netflix show ""YOU""",5,2023,05,11
119,Not as fancy as it looks.,"Checkin staff were completely unable to check me in without a credit card. I fell asleep on the sofa in the lounge waiting for a manager who was barely able to do it.
Other hotels I've stayed at have just gone ""Oh well, you'll have to pay as you go at the bar etc.""
The room was large but the window rattled a lot and there was quite a lot of noise from the corridor.
The interior all seemed a little worn around the edges.",2,2023,05,10
119,Unique stay on the water in the Docklands ,Superb experience all round . Friendly helpful staff . The feel of a luxury yacht on arrival . Comfortable spacious cabins . Great food in the restaurant for dinner and a full buffet breakfast with wonderful views across the water,5,2023,05,08
119,Didn’t disappoint,"What a place!
Great service, lovely rooms we will be staying again. The staff were helping and we’re always happy. Breakfast was Amazing! Plenty to choose from can’t wait to stay again. 
Short walk to the cable cart to get to the O2 is a bonus ",5,2023,05,07
119,Special location close to Excel London,Big room. Exciting location. Friendly staff. Both UK and European sockets. Needed a place close by the event hall. Not the cheapest option but when are you able to say you had breakfast on a boat in London :-),5,2023,05,06
119,A good time was had on the Yacht ,"We had a really good time on the yacht. Comfortable ,clean and spacious room. A nice  view of the dock and docklands. Easy travelling to the O2 arena. The staff onboard were very helpful, friendly and polite. We would definitely recommend to anybody wishing to stay in London its just a different experience. We will definitely be back. ",5,2023,05,06
119,Great location for EcCel ,"Had to book a hotel in the area for work, and was surprised that this one was the cheapest (walking distance to the Excel). It was really nice, and the room was surprisingly big. Staff were friendly and breakfast was good. Can't fault it at all  - would recommend ",5,2023,05,05
119,Nice overall but a little dated.,"On entrance to the hotel it’s lovely the outside and the reception.
The rooms are dated but well cared for. I feel some modernisation would be beneficial.
Staff are friendly and happy to help.
Bar was very busy and pricey but nice setting.
We are in the restraint but have written a separate review.
I would go back to this hotel if I’m that area but I wouldn’t rush to go back.",4,2023,05,04
119,A great disappointment,"A big disappointment! Have stayed on the sunborn in Gibraltar before which is head and shoulders above this! The room was dated, no way of opening the window and the AC was poor. The room was so hot that it was almost unbearable. Breakfast was very poor the next morning- no glasses so we had to have our orange juice (which was warm) in mugs. Poor filter coffee & breakfast quality wasn’t very good, not what you’d expect from a hotel of this standard. Bar area was lovely but prices are through the roof, £18 a cocktail which is what I was paying in Dubai recently. I personally wouldn’t go back, a real shame! ",3,2023,05,03
119,Birthday package - very poor,"I booked the Sunborn for my husband’s 50th birthday (actually stayed on his birthday).  I told the hotel in advance to see if they could make it extra special.  They advised there were various packages I could book including the ‘birthday package’ which included balloons and banners for £25.00.  I duly did so.  On arriving at the hotel,  the reception staff did not even acknowledge my husband.  When we got to the room,  there were balloons scattered in the floor,  but no banners and the decorating had not been done with any care.  There were some chocolates which was a nice touch but overall very underwhelming for the price paid. I immediately emailed the front desk saying how disappointed I was.  I received an  acknowledgment saying  my email had been passed to a manager but 2 days on and follow up.  The hotel room itself was lovely as was breakfast the next day.  But for me the trip was spoilt.",3,2023,05,03
119,A superyacht at discount prices.,"A rare find in London, perfectly located for the docklands, the O2, Canary Wharf or anyone wanting to be closer enough to the city but happy to travel a couple of stops on the tube. 

A converted luxury yacht still has the feel of stepping onto an adventure at sea every younger on board. 
The staff literally can’t so enough for you, from check in to breakfast every little thing is took into consideration. 
The rooms are great and if you get the chance to stay in 5038 you’ll not be disappointed. Will be back again soon.",5,2023,05,03
119,AMAZING LUXURY STAY,"What a stay!! Surprised my partner for his birthday and it was an unbelievable stay. The rooms are huge and very clean. The staff were excellent and so friendly - there was a small mix up with our room which they very quickly rectified and even offered us Prosecco in the house!! A beautiful location and very luxury stay. 
Can’t recommend enough. ",5,2023,05,02
119,Do not doubt!,A unique stay in a Yachthotel! .. located in an trendy aerea .. nice maritime athmosphere .. accessible by cable car .. metrostation nearby .. ok restaurant and breakfast .. spacious rooms! very recommanded!,5,2023,05,02
119,A great place to stay,"Was going to ABBA voyage and looked for a nice hotel nearby, approx £10 in an Uber. Found the Sunborn and booked an executive river view room. From parking to stepping on board with a slick check in process was incredible. The rooms were nice and tidy with the addition of a balcony being a real treat. Breakfast was a nice assortment if hot and cold foods and all was very fresh. Not mad about breakfast buffets but the food was being constantly refreshed. Overall an amazing experience and would definitely stay again if in the area. Ideal for excel, the emirates cable car Stratford and the o2.",5,2023,05,02
119,A 5 star stay! Wow!,"A 5 star stay! Wow what a unique and incredible hotel! Just a minutes walk to Excel, easy to park in the Excel car park next door, the staff and teams were so welcoming, friendly and fun, just what you need on a stay. The views are beautiful, the food was delicious, we had dinner in the restaurant watching the sun go down and seeing the lights start twinkling. The room was spacious, had everything we needed and was relaxing and comfortable. We stayed in 5038 and the wrap around balcony was incredible and we loved having the lounge area to chill and read and the table for catching up with work and having a pre drink before dinner. Whether you’re in Docklands for business or for fun visiting Excel, The o2, Canary Wharf then this is the perfect unique stay in London! Thank you to all the team, and special mention to Francisco and Syreeta and Edi! ",5,2023,05,02
119,Terrible Customer Service,"I booked in for a one-night stay at The Sunborn London hotel in April for my partner's birthday. Unfortunately a few days prior I developed a contagious virus and instead of spending the day at The Sunborn hotel, I was required to spend the day in hospital. 

Considering my circumstances and the fact I had given 72 hours notice, I asked the hotel if they would offer any alternative. The hotel was not willing to refund me, they were not willing to move the booking to an alternative date and the hotel wouldn't even let me change the name on the booking, so I couldn't even offer the stay to a friend. The hotel were happy for me to still attend, knowing this could mean others would catch my virus. 

It's hard to imagine the boat would be full on a Sunday evening in April and I don't think this request would have been difficult to accommodate, however they did not want to. 

To top it off, the day of the booking, once it had passed midnight, the hotel reception continually rung my phone and asked me where I was for my booking. I explained I was in hospital and would not be attending as they had refused to amend my booking. The reception just said OK and put the phone down. 

This was an awful experience and the customer service was terrible. I would not book here again. ",1,2023,05,01
119,Fantastic stay.,Fantastic stay. Quality room with balcony. Pre booked a meal at the restaurant and didn’t disappoint. Food was amazing. Highly recommend staying on board and eating at the restaurant for the evening meal. Breakfast was delicious too. Will definitely be returning. Friendly pub ‘The Fox’ 2 min walking distance and easy access to the Excel centre and cable cars over to the O2 arena. Easy to access from central London on the  Elizabeth Line.,5,2023,05,01
119,Incredibly Fancy and Romantic Experience,"My girlfriend and I went here for our anniversary and we both agreed it was one of the best experiences of our lives. We stayed in a dock facing executive suite and received a warm welcome at check in and the staff were very helpful. The room was very well decorated and classy with a very comfy bed and open balcony. 

We ordered room service and the food came quickly and piping hot. The service was very professional and the food was delicous (I’d recommend the Passionfruit Mousse Cake for desert). Overall this was an incredible experience and one that we agreed we are going to repeat before we’d even checked out. I would definitely recommend.",5,2023,05,01
119,Don’t bother,"Don’t waste your money! We booked for a king size room with what they claimed to be an extra big double sized bed. We arrived to two twin mattress’ put together. The restaurant was fully booked so we didn’t eat there but after reading reviews we are glad we didn’t. Breakfast in the morning was very poor!! No tables, no plates, no fried egg….. even the food that was there, was horrible. Wouldn’t recommend to anyone or book here again.",2,2023,05,01
119,The Titanic was better.,"The yacht. If there was one word to describe it, well, a few, it’s not the luxury let alone four stars they push, more like 3 stars and only if you have to be at eXcel. Which in my case, was the reason.

Pluses
1. Super close to eXcel. You are maybe two minutes, right out the entry and there is eXcel.
2. Fast internet..screams up to 112 download, and around 80 upload…however, at night it will drop, as in you get disconnected,..then you have to reconnect. The speeds will drop accordingly.
3. Morning staff are great, staff in general.
4. Breakfast is solid

Minuses
1. Rooms are dated. We are talking like 1980s style. Especially the bathroom.
I should note I stayed in the 1st floor, which were not the upper class staterooms, but in the pics show a blue sofa. Based on what I have seen, you are not getting 2000s style here.
2. My room, well bathroom had a hair on the wall, and some dirty spots when I checked in,  I wanted a new room, they were booked for that night, so they sent housekeeping. She promptly shows up, cleans off the hair, cleans up the spots and leaves. She was supposed to double clean the bathroom. She did tell me, this happens all the time, because the girls just clean fast.  Ugh. For that reason. I just decided to stay in the room, after the “cleaning” because moving into another room, and their cleaning angle wasn’t a desire.
3. Food options for room service are a joke, and since the restaurant doesn’t have enough places for everyone let alone 15%, you have to make a reservation. 
4. No outbound laundry services, which is bonkers. The majority of folks here are for eXcel, so they are mor business oriented. It’s very common in London to drop you laundry at the front desk, they have a partner laundry service pick it up and so on, not here. I had to pick one near the docks, to make sure I got it within 24 hrs. 
5. The lift. OMG. One of them won’t work with any key card, you can go up to lobby or down to entry, but that’s it. It has been broken for more than a week, they know about it, and still haven’t had anyone come and fix it yet. Thus you either go stairs or push both buttons and wait for the other, 
6. My safe didn’t work, again key issue, plus after the hair debacle I was afraid to put anything, okay my hand in there.

There is no reason to stay here, unless you want to be close to eXcel. Or you want to get a sense of what it was like on Titanic..in 3rd class.",2,2023,05,01
119,Very Very disappointing,"Stayed here last night. Advice for anyone with taste...dont bother!!  The novelty of staying on a yacht in a London dock has its novelties, and certainly our cabin was large and comfortable. BUT the food was unbelievably hopeless! The first two ""starters"" were Bread and then Olives!! Starters? I think not.For a main we had ""Lobster tagliotele"". This was more ""Hunt the Lobster"". There was some, accessed by the difficult to understand DLR.  mysterious lumps in the pastabut they were crispy and might just have been lobster shell?  Wine and drinks generally were overpriced. Many of the guests were young people who presumably were there for the novelty of the place. Worst of all ,the Yacht is located in a newly developed part of town . Othere than the view, there is absolutely nothing to see or do in the vicinity. It is located in a characterless no-mans land. Avoid unless you like being disappointed.",2,2023,04,30
119,Expensive novelty trip - not a quality experience ,"Very disappointed. Went for a special occasion and with perhaps the promise of luxury and fine dining I would liken our experience to a Weatherspoons/ holiday Inn. Food In restaurant very mediocre and limited. Wine list also very limited. Not much atmosphere in restaurant. Had to ask for water, bread extra, service just about ok. Very disappointed and kept apologising to my partner about the experience. The bar also had slightly limited options available. This is a a  novelty trip all be in an expensive one! Don’t expect a 4 star experience . Breakfast was definately a holiday in type experience too, had to make your own tea, coffee and toast, would have expected more for the price",3,2023,04,29
119,Anniversary dissapointment,"Booked Sunborn for our 30th Anniversary. When checking in, the receptionist, although efficient, was not particularly personable. The room was quite nice, although the air conditioning was set centrally and could not be adjusted. Also the window did not open, meaning the room was a bit too warm for us. We had booked a package which included dinner, which was very enjoyable and the staff were very friendly and attentive. However, the breakfast in the morning was awful! The system that they use to keep food warm, basically boils everything in the serving containers. The eggs (both scrambled and fried) had a grey hue to them where they had continued to cook, the hash browns were soggy because of the steam, and the sausages were of poor quality. I left most of the cooked choice and decided to try a couple of mini Danish pastries. unfortunately these were slightly stale. Don't think it was particularly good value for money and will not be returning",3,2023,04,27
119,A thoroughly enjoyable stay,"I stayed here for 1 night with 2 friends (we shared a family room). We all thought that the yacht was very well appointed, and that the staff were very helpful and friendly. We also enjoyed our breakfast on the day of departure, which was buffet style. We all agreed that we would choose to stay here again in the future, and would recommend it to family and friends",5,2023,04,24
119,Unique hotel stay on the water,"This is a great hotel, so different to usual! You are very close to central London by tube but feels like a different world with the water setting. Our room was spacious with a comfortable super king size bed, a sofa and water view. The hotel was in a fantastic location and we particularly enjoyed drinks in the Sundown Bar with views over the water, the 02 and Canary Wharf - it was lovely! ",4,2023,04,24
119,A nice weekend getaway,"We stayed there for a weekend getaway and it was wonderful, felt living closer to water is a awesome choice in our future. The room is cozy and clean and it is close to the tube station. We had really nice time there. Thank you very much. Looking forward to the next time.",5,2023,04,22
119,"Excellent Service, above and beyond!","What excellent service, thank you Cosmo. Unfortunately we found ourselves is some very difficult unexpected personal circumstances and Cosmo went out of his way to help us, his assistance was greatly appreciated at such a difficult time.",5,2023,04,22
119,Fab stay!,"We had a wonderfully relaxed 2 night stay celebrating our 25th wedding anniversary. Lovely spacious room, with a balcony. Nice to have underfloor heating in the bathroom & nice big shower! Room for 2!! We also enjoyed a scrumptious afternoon tea! Friendly, helpful staff. Would highly recommend. ",5,2023,04,19
119,A perfect weekend,"I booked a room to celebrate my husband and daughter’s birthday.  Everything was perfect. The staff at the reception was all smiles when we arrived, approachable and friendly. The location is just perfect and I love the sight of the river plus city lights , the O2 arena can also be seen from our window.  Clean room and spacious. Good selection for breakfast too and the view is just stunning… will book again!",5,2023,04,19
119,Very good stay,"Very good place to stay. Staff are very helpfull and cabins are clean and very comfortable and quiet . Easy to get to ion DLR stop at excel centre. Simple to find.
Bar is a great place to relax after a busy day.",5,2023,04,19
119,Great experience and location,"If you’re looking for a different hotel experience in London this is for you. Fantastic location and views, and very comfortable rooms. The staff are all helpful and friendly and go out of their way to give information about local facilities and travel. The buffet breakfast is good, and there’s lots of it, but it is what it is. Very worthwhile experience for a London visit.",4,2023,04,19
119,Cool place. Comfortable surroundings with excellent service.,"Lovely hotel! Stayed 4 nights. Staff couldn’t have been more friendly, helpful and courteous, in particular Euridice who shows a genuine interest in guests. Food in bar was above average. Restaurant food and service also good. Looking forward to return visit!",5,2023,04,18
119,What a unique superb hotel.,"So pleased we choose this for our anniversary, top-class luxury accommodation in the heart of Docklands.

Very well decorated in the style of an ocean-going liner with a wonderful reception area and a great lounge and bar.  The room was lovely with a balcony looking out onto Docklands. The staff are very friendly and helpful and we had a wonderful stay.

It would make a great base for an event at the O2 arena, just take the cable car over which is a great experience in itself.

Highly recommended.",5,2023,04,17
119,Birthday celebration.,"Great service, rooms, lunch, bar etc. Staff were very helpful and efficient. Especially Michael in the bar. We have stayed here before but it was a flying visit. Sunborn hotel is a real novelty and lived up to all our expectations. Well done all of you. ",5,2023,04,16
119,Good stay ,"Was bought this as a gift, rooms were really good, food was amazing , excellent choices and staff very good and attentive. Breakfast was good .. only one down side to be picky was the bar had no atmosphere at all but we was in a group so didn’t bother us , however if there just as a couple would of been nice ",4,2023,04,16
119,Great stay on the boat,Excellent place when being on the exhibition. Genavive at reception an absolute charm and very helpful. Rooms and views are very nice. Breakfast really smart. This is the second time I have been here. And next year again.,5,2023,04,15
119,Gorgeous ,"Gorgeous experience, I think it might have been slightly before this date actually. Would definitely do again and recommend. The meal in the on board restaurant was possibly the best part, it was fantastic! ",5,2023,04,13
119,Enjoyed my Birthday Stay !,"TIA has provided great customer service and Thanks to her and my partner too. 

I was surprised to find Special touch Tia provided as I found birthday direction in my upgraded room and I have enjoyed my stayed so much that I booked another night stay,

Thanks for the experience :-)",5,2023,04,13
119,An unexpected gem ,"Holy heck what a find. This hotel has to be one of the most unique ideas for a hotel i have ever come across. My family and i stayed here for a few days and we honestly felt like we had stepped into the Titanic (pre sinking). The entire hotel feel luxurious, the rooms are spacious to say the least, if you have a river facing view it is awesome, the food and drink in the restaurant and bar were top notch and even though you are under the flight path of planes landing at the London City Airport (like all hotels in the docklands area) if your doors are shut you don't hear a thing
And lets not leave out the staff. Talk about an amazing group of people. John and Syreeta at the front desk bent over backwards to help us get the perfect room for our small family. Then there was Chloe in the restaurant and bar who treated us like old friends. If we find our selves in London again we will definitely be checking here first for rooms.",5,2023,04,10
119,Great hotel,"So quirky and unique… great location super clean rooms and comfy bed.

Great breakfast although busy the staff were constantly replenishing food and extremely kind!

We had a river facing balcony room I highly recommend as the fresh air was amazing 

Right ne t to the cloud lift over to the o2 fantastic!",5,2023,04,09
119,Something different!,"What a great spot to stay in London. Good transport nearby,quiet open area plenty of places to eat. Well looked after on the boat a lovely place to stay. You could not fault it.
Maybe the pillows could have been a little softer but it did not stop us getting a good nights sleep after wandering round the many places to visit",5,2023,04,08
119,Superb Sunborn stay!,"Superb stay at the Sunborn yacht! Stunning reception area, bedroom was spacious and immaculate. Very comfy bed! Bathroom was spotlessly clean. Breakfast was delicious. Great location; a short stroll to the gondolas over to the O2 plus lots of restaurants just by the yacht itself. All in all a completely positive and fabulous experience! Highly recommend!",5,2023,04,06
119,Novelty but Average,Waited outside the hotel for ages to check in as only 1 lift working and not stopping at Entrance level- felt uneasy should there be a fire.Paid to upgrade with balcony and breeze good as room hot.Breakfast very average and every slice of toast from machine burnt.In bar sourdough bread brought to table without knife or plate?? 12.5% service charge added to drinks without discussion and with poor service?-good for novelty of yacht hotel but stayed in far better run hotels.,3,2023,04,05
119,Customer care is awful,This one night stay was a nice stay but unfortunately didnt end well.we Went to bed only to find two single beds put together with a wafer  thin mattress. We was informed due to access of the rooms beds needed to be put together like this .After having the worst night sleep myself and my husband went to speak to the manager. We was told our next stay would be at a much better rate due to the issue. I sent my first email to book another stay for  later this year and was told someone would get back to me. A month or so later and still no reply I sent another email only to be ignored again. My third email was sent not so long ago with a reply that someone will get back to me. Three emails ignored. This is the worst customer communication I have ever experienced. I have tried to call but no one has picked up. The boat itself is beautiful and has high standards. It's a shame that the people who deal with this side of things lack in customer care and are just outstandingly rude.,1,2023,04,05
119,Sons 11th birthday,Stayed here for two nights for my sons 11th birthday check in was smooth our room was much larger than I would have expected a really big double bed and a double sofa bed my son was given a card and chocolates for his birthday we had cocktails one evening in the bar area they were on the expensive side but they were really nice overall we had a really nice stay and would stay here again,5,2023,04,05
119,Basics need attention,"What a shame, I would love to give a 5 star review but some 'basics' need attention.
The entrance to the hotel check in is via 2 lifts, these are too small, and too few, and customers were finding them confusing to operate. Not a great first impression. The room was lovely, but the beds and pillows were straight out of the Flintstones, hard as rocks.
Breakfast is simply not up to scratch, budget hotels do this better. The bacon was mostly fat, undercooked and swimming in liquid. The coffee is of a quality that was served in English cafes 20 years ago. 
These basic things are what we expect from a Premier Inn, it should be standard in an establishment such as the Sunborn.
I don’t want to sound too negative, it’s a great place to stay, and a great location, I’d stay again.",3,2023,04,04
119,Nice romantic night away in luxury ,"One of the best experiences we have ever had. Very kind and attentive staff from the second we go there. The room was something from the movies and didn't want to leave. Total comfort and luxury. The meal the evening was sublime and perfect and breakfast was just great aswell. If you are looking for a stylish unforgettable break away, don't even look anywhere else, Sunborn hotel has it all. We will be back for sure and can't wait until then. ❤️
Perfection. Thank you so much. ",5,2023,04,04
119,Breakfast and service needs improvement!,"Beautiful accommodation, the room was lovely, very clean and comfortable beds. Coffee and tea provided in the room. The coffee is pods to be used in a provided machine, it tasted horrible. Sachets of instant Nescafé would have been better.
The other disappointment was the breakfast. The staff could not cope with the demand. You had to join a long queue and wait for a table, there was no cutlery. Plates were dirty and marked. The food was not replenished quick enough, I never did get any croissants or bread rolls. Fruit juice was available but no glasses and the coffee was once again awful, no latte or cappuccino .
We complained to reception on booking out and was told they realised there was a problem with breakfast service and they were doing the best they can!
Plenty of room for improvement of the breakfast",3,2023,04,02
119,Sunborn pure Excellence,"Well I can highly recommended Sunborn.  From the minute you arrive, they treat you, and make you feel special. Room was gorgeous, very well presented.  We ate in Lands End Restaurant, this was 1st class. The breakfast was excellent, plenty off choice. Will definitely be going back",5,2023,04,02
119,best sunset in london,"Very friendly staff and well trained, very clean rooms and well equipped, quiet harbor, very nice for watching planes, in restaurant very good cuisine.  We would love to come back there is nothing to complain about!  unique experience in such a yacht",5,2023,04,01
119,One of the best hotels I've stayed in,"We absolutely loved our stay. The staff are great and literally go above and beyond to help in any way possible. We were given an upgrade on our room which was a lovely surprise. The bar and restaurant were just as good, very reasonably priced. I really cannot recommend this hotel enough. Thank you for our lovely stay",5,2023,04,01
119,A spot of Squillionaire glitz and glam when you're otherwise quite poor 🤣,"We have just returned home from a two-stop stay in London to celebrate a 50th birthday and all I can say about Sunborn is, I really wish we'd stayed on it both nights!! The whole experience was flawless from boarding to leaving with glum faces because we didn't want to go home! 
Sunborn is really special, despite being a hotel with multiple rooms, you really do feel a bit like a Squillionaire aboard your own ship! The rooms are huge, would definitely recommend a balcony and river view if possible, beautifully kept and clean. The bed was also excellent, which made getting up quite hard work, despite a kind complimentary slightly later check out!!
The 'communal' areas are beautiful with exceptional views. There is a restaurant and a couple of bars if you're after more informal dining.  The terraces to the stern look directly toward the o2 arena and Greenwich peninsula.
Practically wise, be prepared to walk with luggage as (unless I missed something!) there isn't vehicle access with the surrounding areas having lots of shouty signs and double red lines advising you'll be slapped with a hefty fine if you stop ANYWHERE 😅 We opted to use Excel's parking, £25 for 24hrs which isn't too bad given all things London, considered. Food and drink aboard isn't cheap so be warned but it didn't make me cry quite as much as the £18 large glass of wine at the o2 arena!! 
The staff were wonderful, with friendly room attendants, bar and kitchen staff and reception team. 
To end, thank you so much for looking after us, we enjoyed ourselves so much and your staff are an asset to the operation of glitz and glam. With thousands of hotels in London, Sunborn is truly special and I wouldn't hesitate to recommend. ",5,2023,03,27
119,Free upgrade to a suite……WOW !!,"Wow what a place !!! We booked one night here for my wife’s 50th Birthday and they upgraded us to a suite free of charge which made it even more memorable.Luxury wherever you turn on this wonderful yacht along with attentive and helpful staff make it a truly magnificent experience.
Dinner at Lands End restaurant on board is a must with it being great food although pricey it is definitely worth spending as much time on this unbelievable yacht as possible.
Breakfast was really busy but the staff work so hard to keep everything ticking over nicely.
If you’re looking for something different for a stay in London give this a try and you won’t be disappointed. Look for a deal such as “ Romantic package “ with dinner and breakfast included and you wasn’t restricted as to what you could order off the menu either, any starter main & desert.",5,2023,03,26
119,Naomi - March 2023,"Excellent, attentive service from the moment we arrived.  We ate dinner on the Friday night in the restaurant on board, and the three course meal was perfect.  
The bedroom was really big, it was lovely having a door that we could open (we stayed in a river view Exec room) and stand outside looking at the tranquillity of the water.
The location is perfect for 02 and Excel and getting into London was easy on the Elizabeth Line, which is a 2min walk from Sunborn, at the Excel.
Would recommend, can't wait to stay again.
",5,2023,03,23
119,Great find,"We saw this hotel from the cable cars locally and took a walk down to see if we were allowed to have a drink there at all. 

It’s a stunning place and the bar was very welcoming. They had space for us to eat in their restaurant too. 

Very enjoyable we will be back.",5,2023,03,23
119,"Great stay, will definitely book again.","Fantastic stay from initial reception, through to lunch at Lands End restaurant and evening spent on yacht. Lovely room with balcony. Staff very helpful and welcoming from start to finish. Recommend and will definitely be back.",5,2023,03,21
119,Excellent ,"Stayed on the sunbourne with my husband, daughter and son in law for his birthday . We have stayed here before and each time absolutely love it. The staff are extremely helpful and friendly the rooms are super comfy. Dinner alway amazing and breakfast just as delicious  can't wait for our next stay ",5,2023,03,20
119,Another excellent experience...,My sister in law stayed here last Weds night. Unfortunately for us London was in gridlock due to strikes so we didn't arrive until 11 30 pm. Hence unable to comment about dinner & the bar! The twin room was spacious. Maybe request view over the river. Beds were comfy if in need of replacement. Very clean. Breakfast was excellent. ,5,2023,03,20
119,March stay for George Ezra at the 02,"Staying at the sunborn is a special experience,like being on a cruise ship .you are greeted by friendly and professional staff once you make your way to reception on the 3rd floor in the entrance lift.We was lucky to be upgraded to a thames balcony view cabin,it was beautiful,spacious,the bed was so comfortable and the shower very powerful,I felt a new person after using it.the breakfast buffet  had plenty of choice and was delicious.Would def stay again.",5,2023,03,19
119,Highly efficient and high quality,"The staff were superb and the room was amazing on the 5th level....

In the morning I held a breakfast meeting with 3 guests and all ran very smoothly.

Much better that all the other local hotels, and I've stopped in almost all of them...",5,2023,03,13
119,Lovely unique stay,"We wanted to stay somewhere a little different whilst staying in London and we were not disappointed 
Easy accessible via the tube, clean location, peaceful and quiet
We enjoyed drinks in the bar, our room overlooked the dock but was comfortable and clean
Delicious breakfast 
All in all a lovely stay",4,2023,03,12
119,Our 1st anniversary at Sunborn Yacht Hotel,"Our 1st anniversary husband and family went to stay to Sunborn Yatch Hotel one word “ AMAZING “! 
Stunning interior decor staff are very helpful and professional nothing was too much for them we stay for 2 nights with daughter and I have to say the service was truly Devine ! 

Would definitely stay again ",5,2023,03,05
119,Unhelpful and rude,"Although I cannot comment on the stay itself, I’m leaving a review regarding their customer service. Due to a medical emergency we were unable to stay tonight, I contacted the hotel as soon as possible to explain the situation and the man I spoke to was nothing short of rude and unhelpful. I completely understand there are T&Cs but I was simply asking for a change not a refund. Even a gesture would have gone a long long way and I’d have happily rebooked paying again. But all I got was “well there’s nothing that can be done, it’s your fault not ours you can’t come”. I have a 2 year old in hospital, I didn’t choose to change my plans on purpose.",1,2023,03,04
119,A great stay in a fantastic location.,"Very friendly and welcoming staff at reception.
Our family room was spacious, clean and comfortable with a porthole window view of the dock area.
Breakfast was a plentiful buffet of hot and cold choices that were replenished constantly.
A fantastic location for the Excel and the O2 just a short cable car ride away.
A very nice stay and highly recommended.",5,2023,02,27
119,40th Birthday ,"What an amazing place to stay, stayed here twice and will definitely be staying again! 
Staff are so friendly and go the extra mile! 
Beautiful hotel and beautiful rooms with great views! 
Definitely recommend this hotel for anyone! ",5,2023,02,27
119,Classy rooms and great experience,"We stayed overnight in a very spacious room. Very clean and smart decor. The public areas are smart and light with a stunning staircase in the reception area.  Breakfast is very good with choice of juices breads cold meats cheeses hot food and fish. So you will not have any issues finding something to suit. 
All the team members we spoke to were friendly and helpful. 
Would stay again and being mooted next to Excel Arena is an ideal place to stay.",5,2023,02,25
119,Poor decor. Little sleep due to fan noise. No parking available.,"Stayed for 2 nights and had high expectations for all the photos shown of this boat. The decor in the classic rooms is outdated, apparently you can have better in an exec room but considering the classic rooms are on the website for between £129-£149 per night then it’s a little steep to pay more for better furnishings.

Noise from fan will keep you up all night / I had 4 hours sleep both night. Fan is constantly on from the air con unit even when you switch it to the off setting. It gets warm in the room so you need to put air con on, it gets noisier.

Parking available? Not really. Blue badge holder yes you can but for anyone else no free parking available. Not even offered to allow us to park up so we could drop cases off first before trying to find parking. Excel and Novotel charge £25/ night and £5 per hour. As staying for 2 days this would have been £50. Go on just park to find parking nearby, I had to park about 2 miles away (friends house) and then get an Uber to and back £10 per commute with all the cases. Why can’t you have an association with excel car park and offer a discounted 24 hour charge for £10 like a lot of other chain hotels do.",2,2023,02,24
119,Pretty poor!,"I stayed here in the early 2000s and had a really good experience. It was my partner’s birthday and I thought I’d surprise her with a stay here in December 2022.

Unfortunately we were given a lower dock side room, right next to the service ramp, so little to no view, we ordered some drinks and they arrived promptly. We ordered some more, but they never arrived, so they had to be chased. A little annoying.

However, at 4am in the morning, we were awoken by an awful sound, which I can only assume was from deliveries arriving to the yacht and being taken on bored via the service ramp. This noise would repeatedly happen every 20 to 30mins, until we left, and would last each time for about 20 to 30seconds.

The other thing to note, that since staying in the early 2000s, the yacht has not been updated at all, apart from an external paint job, so the interior looks very tired and dated. One of the lifts was also out of use for the entirety of our stay.

A few days after staying, I was sent a feedback form and I informed them of the problem with the drinks, and the repetitive noise starting at 4am in the morning, which awoke us. It’s now 3months since and I haven’t had any sort of response, which shows a neglect for good customer service.

Would I stay here again, absolutely not! For the money, there are far nicer places to stay in London.",2,2023,02,21
119,Fantastic stay,"We had a fabulous overnight stay. The hotel is impressive when you arrive and upon entry. Staff were welcoming and friendly. Easy to park at the Excel (£25 for 24 hours).  We had an executive double River view room which was clean, spacious and warm.  Dressing gowns, slippers, toiletries, tea, coffee & biscuits and water provided.  We didn’t eat in the restaurant but went to the bar for an evening drink and had breakfast which was plentiful and delicious.  Really lovely break away and a peaceful nights sleep. You can hear the planes going over if the doors are open in your room but didn’t change our opinion of the stay.",5,2023,02,21
119,Excellent birthday surprise.,"I had a memorable experience with my son who celebrated his 15th birthday on the yacht. 

The service and hospitality was amazing.

The room was comfortable and I would recommend others to visit this venue. 

If you’re looking for family friendly, business, solo or a once in a lifetime experience, Sunborn Hotel is the place to go.",5,2023,02,20
119,A lovely stay,"Really lovely stay on the sunborn. Check in was smooth. Staff helpful and friendly. Bar was a bit understaffed on Friday night but still ok. Room was lovely and spacious with all amenities. Only downside is bathroom that is in need or a refurbishment but fully functional. 
We didn’t eat onboard but you can book breakfast on day if you wish",4,2023,02,19
119,Overnight stay,"The hotel was amazing! The room was spacious and comfy with tv, tea & coffee. The bathroom was lovely and the shower was amazing. We ate breakfast here which was buffet style with plenty of choice. The decor is beautiful and the bar was open till midnight. Will definitely return",5,2023,02,19
119,River staycation so beautiful ,The Sunborn is a beautiful staycation.  So close to the O2 and surrounding activities. The grand lobby rooms and food are all wonderful. I just wish that there was some kind of spa or treatments available on board to complete a perfect staycation. I would like to go again but would make plans to attend some of the Afternoon Tea  and cocktail sessions.,5,2023,02,18
119,Birthday weekend,"Stayed Saturday night for my birthday. It was also valentines weekend. The  stay was great, staff excellent, lovely room, nice bar . The reason I only put 4 was because we booked the Valentine’s special meal. Paid £220 and the menu was two choices plus a vegan option. The food was bland and we really didn’t enjoy it at all , although the service was very good. I would definitely stay here again , enjoyed  the experience and the location just a few minutes walk from the cable car to the O2 . However, I would eat elsewhere .",4,2023,02,18
119,London overnight,"Great room, lovely staff, pleasant experience being aboard the yacht. This venue provided us with a reasonable priced night, great position for what we wanted to achieve. Breakfast was good, hot and of a good quality. 4 out of 5 is because we couldn’t access the bar at 2255, despite being a 2300 closing, it was already closed",4,2023,02,17
119,Fabulous stay!,"Another fantastic stay. Great room complimentary upgrade, lovely friendly staff. Excellent location. Lovely atmosphere and service in the bar. So close to the o2, just a quick ride in the cable. Close to train/DLR to get around London. Fantastic views across the river .",5,2023,02,15
119,London trip,The Sunburn hotel offers a unique floating hotel experience nearby the Excel and Thames sky cable car. It is convenient for access to the Thames clipper river taxis. Excellent food in the bar area. Only minor criticism was that there was no room service menu in our room. Room quality was good,4,2023,02,13
119,Not something we expected…..,"After hearing many spectacular things about the Boat me and my partner decided to stay on the valentines weekend, we were warmly welcomed upon the boat, we checked in and reception basically tried telling us we owed monies of which we replied no. She continued to apologise and say oh two card transactions you added something on sir (which then ruined the surprise) we’ve got to our room which should have been decorated with rose petals, swans and chocolates, instead I opened the door to happy birthday balloons 🤣, obviously we’ve complained it’s completely wrong, to which we were offered a bottle of Prosecco for the mistake, for the price my partner paid for the room arrangement that was a joke. We were offered a complimentary drink at the bar (of which was limited to what we could have) which was thoughtful and they insisted on making the room how it should have been to begin with. We stayed at the bar for a good 45 mins before we could arrive back to our room, for something that looked like it’d been erected in 5 mins 🤦🏼‍♀️ service in the bar considering it wasn’t that busy was horrendous bar staff didn’t know what certain drinks were and couldn’t price anything properly as we were over charged and under 🤣 with it being table service it was slow even after ordering drinks to which we waited a good 10 mins before receiving ours, we had a mooch around the restaurant wasn’t busy and they had no event on upstairs in the sky lounge. Very disappointed considering we heard so many good things about the place, would recommend for the beautiful scenery, but not the service. ",1,2023,02,12
119,Fantastic weekend on the Sunborn Yacht Hotel,"We had an amazing weekend at the hotel. The whole place was stunning and the staff couldn’t do enough for us. True 5 star service. The rooms were spacious, spotless, comfortable and beautiful. We can’t wait to go back again.",5,2023,02,08
119,Best Hotel... Ever 💜💜💜💜,"We stayed at the Sunborn on 4th Feb 2023 as we had recently got engaged and had wanted to stay on the Yacht since we went to the ExCel Centre last year and fell in love with it. From check in, where we were Welcomed Aboard, to check out, the staff couldn't have been more lovelier or friendlier. The Yacht in itself is decadent, beautiful, charming and absolutely pristeen. We booked the Executive King Room with a River View and balcony and I'm so pleased we did. It was gorgeous. You could see the Docklands and London Skyline all lit up at night. Breathtaking. The bed was so comfy and heavenly. Everything was just perfect. We ate at the Sundown Bar in the evening and had a mixture of dishes. The staff were incredibly attentive and kind. The cocktails were divine. We slept soundly in our comfy bed. The breakfast was lovely with a wide selection. Our only regret is that we couldn't stay longer...

In Summary, this place is beautiful and by far the best we have ever stayed in. We were so sad to leave but will definitely be back.

Thank you to ALL of the wonderful staff who made our stay so magical.

It's definitely our new special place and we can't wait to go back when we are married or hopefully sooner xxx💜💜💜",5,2023,02,08
119,Amazing place to stay,Such a fantastic place to stay couldn't do enough for us staff so friendly and welcoming breakfast was amazing. Rooms fantastic have booked to stay again already it's a must visit highly recommend the view from the riverside is lovely ideal if you visiting the O2,5,2023,02,05
119,Worst night ever,Stayed with my wife for my birthday worst night ever contacted the manager who promised to email me back and nothing so will not be returning. Ruined a very special birthday so thank you sunborn for making it a bad stay.,1,2023,01,31
119,Very nice 3 course dinner,"I came here with a group of friends, all first time visitors. Delicious dinner, fabulous plush restaurant, friendly prompt efficient attentive customer service, a very nice evening, I would certainly come back here, highly recommended",5,2023,01,30
119,Great hotel shame about the restaurant ,"Lovely clean themed hotel, great room with lovely view, all in all a great night's stay, however, all badly let down by the restaurant with a measly choice of 6 dishes all with prices I would expect from a city centre Mitchelin star restaurant which this certainly wasn't.",4,2023,01,30
119,Awful,"Nothing more than a floating premier inn, don’t bother, there are far nicer places to spend money and that’s being nice. Food menu appalling, rude breakfast staff and top prices. Wished I stayed at home. ",2,2023,01,30
119,Super visit to an exciting different hotel,"Spectacular hotel - something very different -  with spacious and very comfortable rooms.

The staff are incredibly welcoming and were very keen to help out with anything we needed.

Perfectly placed for Excel or other things in and around Docklands.",5,2023,01,29
119,Highly recommend ,The rooms are spacious and comfortable. I have stayed here on business and for pleasure with my wife. It is well connected to the DLR and London plus there's no hassle  parking with Excel's car park a two minutes' walk away. I avoid the congestion charge and dine well on business. Highly recommended ,5,2023,01,24
119,Very disappointing 80th birthday,"I booked for 4 classics and 1 executive suite
and a meal in the Landsend restaurant and it just was not good enough ! Check in was a disaster we didn’t get into our rooms until 4 pm . The rooms are spacious but dated and not up to date . The meal was nice but service was bad . The restaurant has a big party upstairs and we’re very short staffed so service between food took ages . They knew this was a special birthday in advance but there were know nice touches . Save you money and go somewhere where you are treated as paying guests . I would not recommend or return to this hotel",2,2023,01,23
119,It was overall enjoyable just checkin being messed around found disappointing,"Great location, great food, clean rooms , disappointed could not check in on time and had to wait in the bar for over an hour, I would of thought with checkout at 11am plenty of time to clean room, for any hotel charging a premium especially as we spent a few grand being able to access room on arrival for 3pm should be a standard",4,2023,01,23
119,Superb Sunborn Yacht prime location proffesional Attentive Staff Amazing Food,"Stayed the night on The Sunborn Yacht for our wedding Anniversary our 7th visit I have recommended the hotel to all my family and friends and they love it too.
Attentive staff can’t do enough Proffesional waiter service food is amazing.
Many pubs and restaurants near by chair lift over to the O2 
Stations are close by.
Highly recommend!!!
Date of visit: January 2023",5,2023,01,19
119,Staying on a super yacht,Beautiful vessel but it would have been helpful to let us know they don’t have parking unless u are a blue badge holder. Had to park in the Excel which was expensive. Another helpful piece of advice would have been booking the restaurant beforehand. We couldn’t get in the restaurant and there isn’t really anywhere to eat nearby.   The last thing is the fact there is no information about what is or isn’t available onboard.,3,2023,01,17
119,Highly recommended,The staff looked after us so well and we had a wonderful overnight stay. The room was gorgeous and the whole hotel had a lovely feel. We ate an evening meal in the restaurant and the food was exquisite. Location was brilliant - win win all round for us! Highly recommend.,5,2023,01,17
119,Amazing stay,"Me and my partner stayed a night at this hotel due to travelling for the jurassic world exhibit. From the moment we checked in the experience we received was amazing. Check in was well organised and simple, room was easy to find, the property looks amazing inside and out. When we got to our room it was a great size and very clean. The coffee machine was a nice addition and enjoyed having a balcony. Lands end restaurant was beautiful, service was great and the food delicious. I would love to stay here again and would definitely recommend.",5,2023,01,15
119,Overcharged meal and ignored complaint be warned.,"Group booking, overcharged, meals came out randomly and incorrectly appropriated to bill.

It was a joke and frankly embarrassing for a few of us.

They further ignored the complaint, be warned this is a place that doesn't care who you are, where you are from or the time you take explaining the problems.",1,2023,01,14
119,christmas on the sunborn yacht hotel,"I have to say it was one of my best Christmas i have ever had. 
i went with my 11 year old daughter and we had a fantastic time! The food is amazing!! 
the staff are so polite and helpful!
the rooms are beautiful! 

they also put on Christmas films running through the day in the auditorium. 

i had the most amazing time. i will definitely be back",5,2022,12,29
119,Just amazing,My boyfriend and I stayed here for his bday treat and it was totally amazing from very friendly staff to beautiful surroundings and lovely breakfast with plenty of choice. We had the room with a view and it didn’t disappoint even in December !! I would highly recommend 😁,5,2022,12,27
119,Exceeded expectations,"Spent 3 evenings over the Christmas period and were pleasantly surprised at how well managed this hotel is. Might seem as though substance is overpowered by the quirky nature of the hotel seeming to be a floating cruise ship but in reality it is a serious addition to the London hotel scene.
Checking in was easy and the rooms are very spacious. spotlessly clean with plenty of cupboard/drawer space. Complementary coffee, including an espresso machine, mineral water and an easy to operate temperature control with plenty of natural as well as artificial light. Hairdryer included as are complementary toiletries. Also dressing gowns ans slippers. Perfect so far
There is a restaurant and a bar which has a good range of smaller meals with a good selection of soft as well as alcoholic drinks.
The restaurant was first class, the staff were friendly and professional and nothing was too much trouble. There is no vegan/vegetarian menu but you can ask for an alternative to the vegetarian n option. The food was beautifully presented, perfectly cooked and very filling. The wine list is far better than most restaurants of this class although the mark up is quite high.
Transport to and from central London is very good, both the LDR and the Elisabeth lines just yards away from the hotel.
Beautiful views of the river especially at night and a quiet, peaceful location. Any downsides? None at all. 
Special thanks to Eddie in the restaurant who looked after us extremely well. Must return again soon.

119,Fantastic Stay on the Sunbourn,"We’ve been planning to stay onboard and had booked just before the Pandemic only to have to cancel, we booked via Wowcher a cabin and also a meal for two.
Parking is easy at the Excel centre £20 per day.
On our way to the yacht I began to feel unwell, the staff greeted us onboard and made us a coffee as we’d had a long drive, we were informed that the room would be ready at 15:00 and the staff secured our luggage. We went to the bar for a drink, the bar area was festive and the windows are heated so lovely ans warm the atmosphere was good.
The rooms are spacious and clean, the mattress is quite thin but offered a reasonable nights sleep. I think in the summer the place would be buzzing and the deck bars afford great views.
We went to the restaurant for dinner but due to me feeling unwell, I was unable to eat anything we retired early and had dessert sent to the room.
Breakfast the next morning was superb.
Checkout was easy.
I replied to the questionnaire and highlighted that I’d been unwell, I received a friendly compassionate mail and will definitely rebook.",5,2022,12,24
119,Super unique hotel!,"We stayed here during our visit to the London International horse show, which was right beside the excel. We arrived quite early and was able to check in early which we were really appreciative of as we had been up since 4.30am 
We were also upgraded to an executive room with a balcony. 

Our room was clean, we ordered room service, food was great and our breakfast was also perfect. 
We will definitely be back.",5,2022,12,22
119,Unusual and beautiful place to stay when in London,"A lovely place to stay, unusual and elegant. Clean, comfortable and beautiful. Great views and convenient location right outside the excel and just across the water to the 02. 
Stayed with my family, we loved it and felt comfortable and welcomed. Would definitely stay again.",5,2022,12,20
119,one superb night,"we had a "" sea view "" on the 5th deck , room was immaculate , nice and warm , Breakfast generous and varied  , luxury stay , recommend , especially if your visiting the International horse show , as we were",5,2022,12,18
119,One night only,"Convenient location for Excel, very friendly staff. Clean  & well furnished rooms. Lovely breakfast selection. 
Drinks and snacks menu on the bar area until 11pm - expensive but worth it. 

Only suggestion to the hotel - maybe little bottle of body moisturiser and toothpaste would be appreciated for people who forgot there’s 🤣",5,2022,12,17
119,Service needs improving!,"Stayed for 2 nights as very convenient b fire ExCel & London horse show.  Cabin/room 2044,  nice river view. Comfortable & clean. 
1st night had drinks in the lovely bar area and staff were friendly and service quick, but it was very quiet.  Coffee machine and tea in our room for the morning. Breakfast full buffet hit and cold and was really nice.  2nd night,  arrived at bar 22.45 and was very busy, however staff still advised we were ok for drinks and to find a table.  Had to find someone to order our drinks and all of it was ok to order some chips and we were told yes everything should be fine.  We waited 45 mins just fur the drinks, I had to go to the bar and check they had our order and a male staff member behind the bar abruptly says yes they are one they're away! Still waited amidst 10m for them to come.  They missed off 2 glasses of water and the chips. When ask where the did was the staff waiter advised they were no longer serving food!  We ask why they didn't tell us that earlier and her apologized and shrugged his shoulders. Then we ask for our water and he still didn't bring it. Then at 23.55 another member of staff  bought us 2 glasses of water.  We explained why it had come so late and our drinks took 45m they advised because they were really busy. We said at least the manager should have come out and apologised to say the drinks are delayed but will be with you??
We ask for the bill and advised we would not be paying a service charge because the service has been so poor. Then at midnight the manager came over and all what the problem was.  We had to explain again, she apologised and advised they had been so busy and this was the first night of three horse show so we hope they are better prepared for the remaining days and nights of the show.  The manager did present use with a bottle of wine and some crisps and nuts as a token of their poor service.  I advised I would be returning in January for my sister's 60th birthday and really hope we get better service.  Only other thing our coffee was not refilled for the next morning. It's a shame this happened because the sunborn is a lovely yacht and very convenient for ExCel. Fingers crossed for January! ",3,2022,12,16
119,The upgrade was well appreciated,"What a great experience. When I booked this I did not know what to expect but was very excited as it looked wonderful on the website, but as we all know that’s not always the case, but here it certainly is if not the real thing is better.
The staff were amazing and so helpful and on to willing to make your stay as memorable as possible.
The breakfast was great value and was worth while booking. The vegetarian sausage were delicious and such a treat .
The evening meal we had the first night was delicious and served by a couple of new members of staff who were delightful.
The room upgrade that we received was well appreciated and the bed has to be one of the most comfortable beds that I have slept on in a hotel for a while. 
Transport from Heathrow is so easy and the train stations so close by .
Will definitely be back for a longer stay next time .
Thank you so much to all the staff that made our two night stay so prefect.",5,2022,12,16
119,Fawlty Towers,"This hotel is awful. The rooms are poor quality and beds awful. There are lumps in the carpet. It feels unclean.
Currently we are hungry and just advised that there is no food and bar closing. Our event at the Excel has just finished. The hotel bar is packed with thirsty  and hungry people  and there is no available service. I'd recommend the Ibis / Novotel together than this awful place.",1,2022,12,15
119,Worth staying somewhere different to a normal hotel.  Book a Thames view!,"This is a novel, welcoming and lovely place to stay in east London. The staff are professional and welcoming. The reception area is exceptional, it surprises and delights when you step out of the lift entrance. The view from the restaurant overlooking the O2,  cable cars and London skyline is magical.  Cabins are 5 star!",4,2022,12,10
119,Poor customer service,"This trip was booked to celebrate my husbands significant birthday. Given what we paid for a two night stay, I felt the service was lacking. Reception staff particularly disinterested and rude. We had issues with the coffee machine which we reported and it was taken away but not replaced and therefore no coffee available in the morning and they wouldn’t supply instant coffee as an alternative. Our key cards stopped working after one night, when we queried this there was no apology or explanation. When I reported our issues on checking out the receptionist could not have cared less, no apology or acknowledgement. I have had better service and attention to detail at more budget priced accommodation and we have been left feeling dissatisfied and disappointed. I know these are relatively small issues but the issue I have is how it was dealt with and the customer service which was, sadly, very poor.",3,2022,12,08
119,Very rude staff using the F word,"Upon arrival the TV didn't work, the room was very basic with twin beds pulled together with a cheap mattress protector on to make it into a double. After contacting reception to report the TV a very rude woman came to the room, firstly accused me of smoking in the room which is absolute rubbish I don't even smoke and then after telling her no I hadn't smoked in the room and I have literally just arrived and turned on the TV she then used the F word twice saying it F..ing smells of smoke in here, you sure you've not been F...ing smoking. If I hadn't been so unwell  I would have reported her, she should never ever be in a position where she has contact with customers she needs to be fired I couldn't believe what I was hearing. Never ever have I as a customer been spoken to like this in my life. The room was not as expected infact an overall unpleasant experience never to be visited again.",1,2022,12,07
119,Amazing no faults,"Brought for a anniversary present and wasn’t disappointed fantastic hotel with a difference very friendly staff and lovely spacious clean room and a very comfy bed. The breakfast was probably the best hotel one I have ever had.
I would definitely like to visit again",5,2022,12,05
119,Excellent,"We had the best experience here! Staff were amazing and couldnt do enough for us. We were upgraded to an executive room. This hotel is so quiet! No noise so ever as location is away from the busyness of London but close enough to get there quickly. I can't fault our stay. From the reception staff to the bar staff to the cleaning staff who were so lovely. All were brilliant. Breakfast was great and so much to choose from from, smoked salmon to full english to continental! Highly recommend this hotel. Beautiful too.",5,2022,12,03
119,sailing into the city in style!,"My stay at the Sunborn was a great experience from start to finish.Simple and efficient check in where I was delighted to be upgraded to a luxury room on the 2nd floor complete with balcony and riverside view.The room which was of ample proportions was spotlessly clean and extremely well appointed.The central feature was a massive double bed which was very comfortable with multiple pillow choices.The bathroom was small but extremely functional including a very powerful and invigorating shower.The view from the balcony was very pleasant with City airport to my left and the iconic City skyline to my right.Circumstances dictated that I didn’t frequent the restaurant but I did enjoy a drink at the sumptuous bar with a stunning panoramic view of the city!
Following a great nights sleep I checked out with ease and departed having thoroughly enjoyed my stay at the Sunborn Yacht hotel which i would recommend to everyone and to that end I am already looking to make a return visit with my wife.

119,Bad evening,"Had a late arrival, main restaurant closed. Bar open. Served me a complete dry burger with cold hard cheddar cheese was to hungry to return. Commented the bad quality no excuses no questions about dessert or a compensation.
4 star hotel, not…..",2,2022,11,29
119,Well worth staying!!,"Absolutely amazing from start to finish.  

Very friendly customer service.  The room was beautiful and so spacious.  Food excellent and many options.  Drinks are very expensive so be warned and the walk from the orange car park at the Excel is a bit of a walk and not well lit walking across to the hotel.  But would definitely recommend and stay again.",5,2022,11,27
119,The little things make a big difference ,"I booked Sunborn as l wanted something different for my wife's birthday. I booked the room with the evening 3 course meal deal for us both. We arrived early and the lovely receptionist checked our bag and engaged my wife in conversation. My wife suffers from aphasia which makes conversation difficult but the receptionist was patient and charming. We knew check in was at least 2 hours away so we took opportunity to take a walk to the cable car! 
On return we found that we had been given an upgrade on the room, with chocolates and a balloon and a lovely note wishing her a happy birthday. 
The room was impressive, well presented,and spacious and a balcony to boot! 
Dinner was sublime and l do believe the receptionist was instrumental in arranging for us to have a great table with excellent views of the Dock and the London skyline.
It is often the little touches that make the difference and the staff really did this. The chocolates, the hand written birthday wishes, the table in the restaurant were all things that made my wife's birthday so special and l cannot praise the staff highly enough. ",5,2022,11,22
119,Will definitely be back - Thankyou!,"We stayed at the Sunborn Yacht Hotel for one night as a  birthday surprise for my husband with high expectations and we weren’t disappointed, we just wish we’d stayed longer! What a stunning place…..Right next to the Excel and easy to get to via Uber or public transport. The staff were friendly, kind and very helpful, stored our luggage until the 3pm check in and then we were given a free upgrade - Thankyou for that, it was much appreciated!  The rooms were large, and well equipped, the bed was huge and very comfortable.  The balcony was a nice touch too. We had lunch in the bar, served by Charmaine, who, although clearly extremely busy, was just lovely and the meal was really nice, with amazing views out over the O2 and Canary Wharf - what a skyline at night!  The inclusive breakfast was fresh and plentiful - there was no feeling of being rushed, as we also had a complimentary late checkout. In summary, Thankyou Sunborn and your staff, we can’t wait to come back.",5,2022,11,21
119,Don’t recommend at all,"We came for a belated birthday celebration weekend that’s been since Covid lockdown. This leisure trip didn’t live up to expectations at all , the hotel was nice (stayed in nicer) in London , the customer service in hotel including reception and the bar staff were very very poor. The service was slow amd poor , the rooms were not up to standard . We had to go to reception in the early hours in our pyjamas as the room temperature was so cold , the response from the reception was not helpful at all , amd we went down twice as it wasn’t sorted and no one was answering reception . It wasn’t good enough amd there were other issues . Awaiting a response from hotel",1,2022,11,20
119,Don’t waste your money,"This hotel is very over rated, room was small and bathrooms very basic.
Staff are so rude, we asked for a cup of tea at the bar to take to our room. They wanted to charge us £15. They then stood and spoke about us and pointed at us. Heating doesn’t working until he room, waited for someone to come…. No one came. Phones to reception don’t even work. Breakfast was far to busy, staff nowhere to be seen.
Don’t bother",1,2022,11,20
119,Shocking for £550,"Very poor, the cards to work the lifts were faulty every time we went to use them, only had one large towel for the shower, the phone never worked, the tv would not work sent someone to sort it an left us with one channel to watch, got moved to another room in the end the whole experience made me so angry I just went home, I would have sucked it up if it had been £50 a night room but I paid a lot of money, what should have been a stress free weekend turned into the worst weekend of my life that much so that it’s caused me an my partner to split up ",1,2022,11,20
119,Never again,"Arrived to room and found out the AC didn’t work and after multiple people coming to fix eventually after 9 hours and at 3 am we had two fans given to us because we wouldn’t wait for another room to be found since our 18 month old baby was sleeping.
Following day we were told we would get upgraded to executive suit… ( much smaller then our original room ) but wow it had a balcony 😟
The hotel is way below standard in many ways ,
Some staff are very nice and professional but some had no idea what they were doing .
The food and drinks are extremely overpriced and very very average in taste and quality.
The rooms are very outdated towels were stained ..you reach a point you can’t keep complaining and just went to get checked and leave 
This is my last stay at this hotel and wouldn’t recommend it to anyone.
Extremely disappointed is an understatement.",1,2022,11,17
119,Excellent stay,"Arrived at the hotel created by a lovely happy lady , check in was smooth and upgraded to a view over the dock water, This boat hotel is just stunning, staff were very polite and helpful, I would definitely recommend and definitely stay again .",5,2022,11,17
119,First class stay,"Flew into City Airport and a short taxi ride later we were at the hotel.  We arrived well before checkin opened but they managed to look after our luggage until we checked in.   We were going to Mam Mia The Party on Friday night so a short walk and a trip in the cable car we were at the 02.  The room or cabin was spacious and very comfortable.    Immaculately clean as well.  Did not have dinner but the breakfast was excellent on both days.  Read previous reviews stating they were unhappy with the breakfast.   Some people are never pleased.  The buffet had a huge selection of cold meats, smoked fish, cereals, fruit juices, teas/coffee plus the hoy food was very tasty and a big selection.   The chefs constantly replenishing the heated dishes with fresh food.   All the staff were very pleasant making us feel right at home.   Overall it was very good and highly recommended.   The recently opened Elizabeth Line tube gives fantastic access to a wide range of places, even right to Heathrow.  Cannot wait to go back again",4,2022,11,15
119,"A wonderful, relaxing & much needed break","Highly recommend. We stayed here for a night in November 2022 and thoroughly enjoyed our time here. The staff were exceptionally friendly and welcoming, and we appreciated the complimentary upgrade to a river view room - it was a lovely, unexpected touch. The room, or cabin, was spacious and comfortable with plenty of wonderful amenities. A relaxing stay which we hope to repeat again in the future. ",5,2022,11,13
119,Truely a very enjoyable experience,"excellent experience, room was very clean and comfortable, staff were very polite and courteous. Would definitely book again and recommend to others. Breakfast was amazing everything there that you required there was also items available for vegetarians.",5,2022,11,12
119,Another fabulous weekend,"We first stayed at Sunborn the year it opened which was our 20th Wedding anniversary. We've been back every couple of years since when having a weekend in that there London. Our grown up children have also visited with their partners the most recent being our second eldest who was proposed to during their stay. Our most recent visit was with friends for a theatre weekend, they loved it too and will be visiting again, we all had an amazing time staff as always were all very helpful. Rooms are spacious, beds are comfy and there are great showers too.  There were also nice new sofas in rooms this year have family and friends. Luggage storage is available if you want to drop it early collect late to maximize your stay. The new Elizabeth line takes you straight into London without changing lines now or you can uber boat on the Thames. Keep it up Sunborn we will be back next.",5,2022,11,10
119,Lovely Stay - Worth the Experience.,"I have always wanted to stay at the Sunborn and I was not disappointed.

All the staff were extremely helpful, polite, and made our stay more special.

We decided to stay in a Junior Suite with River View.      The room was lovely, extra special touches with Chocolates, complimentary fridge, and water.

I look forward to staying again in the future",5,2022,11,10
119,Totally unique stay!,"What an incredible experience to stay on a hotel boat! 

A pleasure from start to end, lovely staff and spacious clean rooms. 

Nice and close to the convention centre. 

Will definitely be back the next time I need to stay by the Docks!",4,2022,11,09
119,average food & stay was ok,"We stayed overnight during half term in October. It’s not a hotel we would ever opt to book and stay at ourselves. I’d rather stay at Amba Marble Arch as it’s next to Oxford Street or Grosvenor.

This was a gift from a client. It’s out on a limb unless you’re going to the O2 arena or Canary Wharf. We used the Elizabeth lIne and there’s only stairs to drag your suitcases down. I much prefer a taxi. No such option here. It’s on the dock and land opposite is pedestrianised. The reception staff were ok. Our room was in needed to modernising as it felt like we have gone back to the 1990’s. It clean enough. Water pressure was bad my husband said. 

We had dinner here again not a place where we would opt to eat. The meal was so-so for London Prices (we paid a small amount for drinks). Drinks were over priced but it’s to be expected when you’re a captive audience. 

I wasn’t expecting great food so I wasn’t disappointed. We had three courses. The starters were boring except for the salmon. The main dishes were salmon. I don’t like eating meat when I can’t walk it off. The weather was miserable that night. The salmon was fine l, nothing special or to write home about. The desserts weren’t great. Microwaved choc pot. GÜ pots are better. Pistachio icecream didn’t have any taste of pistachios. Our drinks were lame and took ages to arrive. Thankfully my husband had asked for water. 

Breakfast was poor. A buffet type, although they could make you a cooked vegetarian. I don’t like fried food for breakfast. My husbands porridge was fine.

Overall we had a good nights sleep. You will be woken earlier as it’s near the City Airport. Beds were comfortable. Shower pressure was low. I don’t care for TV near the bed. It’s higher up so not great when on sofa. The balcony was small but ok. I only used it to take a video and photos. Boats aren’t my thing and this one was no different. Nothing special much like The Savoy etc. over rated.",3,2022,11,07
119,Excellent,"Decided to stay here as it was different to a regular hotel. 
We arrived early & we were allowed to leave our bags which was great. 
Hotel is right by Custom House station which was great 
Arrived back to the hotel late. 
The room was very spacious & super clean 
The bed was fantastic. Super comfy after walking around London all day. 
We had a fabulous sleep. 
Lovely coffee for once in the room 
Complimentary water which was great. 
Would stay here again !!!",5,2022,11,05
119,The most welcoming staff and beautiful views,"The most accommodating staff nothing was to much. Anmol was an angel on reception very informative. We was upgraded to the most beautiful suite. You get complimentary amenities to indulge in (Tea/coffee/biscuits/water). You have dressing gown and slippers waiting for you in your room so you can unwind for the evening. No need to bring full wash bag with you as they cover mostly what you need. (Just remember toothbrush and paste) .

Sunborn is just a short walk from the cable cars , restaurants and exhibitions if you decide to venture out. In the evening you can enjoy the london skyline view from the restaurant on the yacht.

119,Absolutely Fabulous,Absolutely fantastic great hidden gem in the Capital off the World so near so far as in tranquility from the Big Town . Beautiful Ship with the Spirit of the heart and soul off the Docks of the East End off London great transport routes easy easy for all . The wonderful in the deep wharf off the pass the Hotel Ship liner or whatever is a real breath off fresh air ! Can not wait to stay again ! A great big thank you to all who had such a great idea ! Well done Shaun Hammond,5,2022,11,03
119,Completely underwhelmed,"Hi, we recently stayed at the sun born in the junior suite, the standard was very very poor. We sent an email detailing all our issues and responded to a sunborn feedback email,  a week later and still counting,have had no response.

This is the email sent, with all the issues:
I recently stayed in your hotel with my partner and feel I must let you know how disappointed and underwhelmed we were with the whole experience.
A stay at your hotel had been on our wish list for a long time as your website appeared to show an amazing, unique hotel. We decided to book for a special occasion and choose the suite due to the facilities and extras included.
Unfortunately it started to go wrong from the moment we checked in, we arrived at 1.30 as the website said that early check was included in a suite booking.
We did not get the name of the member of staff that dealt with us but she did have long blond hair, if that helps, she appeared to be very helpful to the couple before us, including checking their luggage in, yet when it was our turn she was very abrupt and just stated check is at 3, no offer of bag storage or anything else.We then sat in the bar for a while, but as I was sure we had early checkin I checked your website which showed I was correct and I went back to reception. Another lady helped me (Giuse ), and when I explained that I believed we we entitled to early check she did everything she could to help, even though she said that early check in was only if the room was available yet the website states early check IS included in a suite package, again Giuse was very helpful and though the suite was still not available she checked us in so that when the suite was free we could go straight up. We finally got to our suite at 2.30ish however if Giuse had of of dealt with us initially rather than the other member of staff our first impressions would have been more positive.

Although we were impressed with the space within the suite, immediately it was apparent that it was not the high standard that we expected and was advertised. The carpet throughout but especially the bedroom had multiple stains along with an imprint of an iron in the middle of the lounge floor, we appreciate that accidents happen as the cleanliness could not be faulted but am sure that a specialist carpet cleaning could remove or repair the carpet, first impressions do count

There were multiple issues with the bathroom:
The toilet was extremely high which made it difficult with my mobility issue to use, there was no warning of this
The toilet was an all singing , dancing with all the mod cons, however it leaked internally which meant the cistern was continuously running hence the flush would not work, we had to stand and continuously push the flush button to eventually stop the leak and fill the cistern to allow us to flush
There were no instruction for the toilet panel controls.
The bath height was the same issue as the toilet height but also the head scratching design. There was a fixed glass panel at the shower /tap end which made it impossible to turn anything on without physically stepping into the bath first and surely with potentially hot water spurting out of a unfamiliar tap, this is a real safety issue.
When we tried to have a bath, the plug did not seal the water so we had to either sit with our foot on the plug or keep the water running continuously which as you can image was Not the relaxing experience we would have hoped.
In a 5 star hotel the grouting finish around the entire bath area looked like it was done by a 5 year old, again very poor impressive of the standard of the hotel

There was no information in the room about the hotel, services or area, I can appreciate that you may have changed paper versions due to covid however there was no info anywhere except a small QR code on the phone. There were still multiple magazines in the room so paper brochures/ info could have been placed with them.

Neither radiator worked and we tried all different settings
The TV reception in the bedroom was very poor to the point we gave up
When we used the TV remote in the lounge it also worked on the TV in the bedroom which was frustrating

The mini bar was stocked with bottle capped drinks with no bottle opener, when we asked reception, they said there was one in the bathroom, there was not we were then sent to the main bar who said they didn't have a spare one, went back to reception and the lady said she would find one and bring it to the room, 40 mins later it arrived but it was implied that it was a massive favour as it was the bars own opener, again not the level of service we expected, can only be described as a bit of a farce.

We also did not realise how close, loud and often the airlines travelled past the hotel, we could actually wave to people on the planes and there was no warning of this.

When I spoke to reception at check out the lady questioned why I did not bring these issues to her attention, but as I explained we wanted a private 2 night stay without the hassle of staff in and out of our room and did not believe these issues could be resolved quickly, the room should be empty before any work is done. The manager was also not available to discuss our issues.
These issues may not seem important to you but we saved for a while and paid over £800 to enjoy a very private, luxurious, wow experience yet it was more like faulty towers. We feel we have wasted our money on a mediocre experience and wish we had of stayed in the cheaper Ibis hotel next door where you get what you pay for, unlike the completely underwhelming experience we have had with you.",1,2022,11,02
119,Sunborn weekend away,"Room was excellent, check in was seamless nothing too much trouble, ate at there “Lands End “restaurant  on Friday despite certain reviews complaining about poor/ slow service we found nothing of the sort service was excellent food was of the highest standard , although a little pricey I didn’t mind paying  top money for a top dining experience . Breakfast on the Sunday was excellent plenty of choice and small amounts in warming plate so was continually being cooked fresh",5,2022,10,25
119,All aboard,"Overdue refurb…
The staff were welcoming upon arrival. But the bedroom needs a new lease of life. Carpets were worn and tugged in areas. The room was 25c unbearable! We tried turning the aircon on to 16c… waste of time.

The bed was a back ache… mattress topper with a bed sheet. Expected more for a 4* hotel.

On a positive note. Staff friendly, clean and the water and coffee was replenished daily!!

Probably wouldn’t stay again but convenient when at a conference at the excel!",2,2022,10,24
119,"Avoid, dreadful staff.","This place is awful, the reception staff are more interested in getting you to accept liability if they burn the place down than they are in providing any sort of help. They do not have a left property service!

There's no drop-off parking, the evening meal was overpriced & poorly prepared. 
The breakfast folks were much nicer, and the location and views of Canary Wharf a real treat. ",1,2022,10,23
119,Fantastic Rooms,"We had an executive room overlooking the river. We had a balcony and the view of the lights reflecting on the river was beautiful.
The room is large with a sofa and coffee table and quality furniture.
The bed is huge and very comfy
All the staff were courteous and friendly and made us feel most welcome.
Very close to Custom House station, so easy to get to places.
The Excel is steps away
Plenty of restaurants in the area
Thanks for making our stay special - I loved the chocolates :)
Next time I may even splash out and upgrade to a suite they look amazing.",5,2022,10,22
119,Crusie in style without moving,"This is truely an amazing place to visit with a difference .......crusing withou moving.
We were upgraded and the room was fantastic so would recommend booking direct Rooms are large and well equiped , above all they are comfortable, you will have a good nights sleep here
There are plenty of bars and places to dine in area but always nie to come back to a comfy bar before bed",4,2022,10,19
119,Disappointing,"I bought a ""Laurent Perrier"" champagne,  afternoon tea experience for my Mum.  Firstly, she said that trying to book was extremely difficult with the voucher.  Once on board, she was asked for an exclusive code, which she didn't have, only the voucher, and was told initially that she would have to pay and the voucher wasn't valid without said code!  After a bit of ""toing and froing"", this was rectified.   My mum said the food was nice.  However, she was then offered  a glass of PROSECCO or a cocktail from the bar.  This was questioned and she was told that the afternoon tea was £80 and therefore there was not enough left for champagne.   I purchased a champagne experience and could have gone anywhere for a glass of Prosecco!  I have tried on several occasions to contact customer services but to no avail.  In my opinion,  don't waste your money as the experience promised is not delivered! £100 is a lot of money for a prosecco afternoon tea and should be clearly advertised! I have a voucher that clearly states a Laurent Perrier champagne afternoon tea, therefore this is false advertising!",2,2022,10,19
119,Pre-booked Cream Tea,"We pre-booked because one of our party of four required a gluten free cream tea. 
To be fair, the gluten free cream tea was very good. The sandwiches, scone and desserts were lovely. 
One of our party, eating the regular cream tea,  wanted just ham sandwiches because he didn’t like the other fillings. This was achieved but we were told it would take half on hour. The other three cream teas were ok but not remarkable. 
The bar and restaurant seemed to be very understaffed. There were only three tables occupied but any simple request we made took ages. The staff were very polite but seemed quite aloof. 
When we arrived one of the tea cups on the table was dirty. A partial brown ring inside the cup. It even took a long time to replace this and then the waitress arrived with four cups. There was no understanding that it was just one dirty cup nor was there an apology for this. 
Our bill for four cream teas and two glasses of wine was over £200 (expected for London) but this was the only place on our four day visit to the capital where we refused to pay the “discretionary” 12.5% service charge. I didn’t want to be in the position of refusing to pay this but the service truly was not worth it. 
We would not return to eat or drink.",3,2022,10,18
119,A must go to hotel and restaurant.,"I stayed here with my daughter for one night, found this hotel as i was looking for places to stay near the Excel London. 
When i saw that it was a yacht hotel, i thought 'wow' pictures were lovely , so we booked.
We wasn't disappointed.
We was third in the que for checking in, and we was waiting no more than 5 mins.
Check in was smooth, staff very happy and professional.
I had read about the £40 charge, this is incase we had any extras added to our room and left without paying, as we could check out online.
This was put back into my account instantly from checking out.
The room was big enough for both of us with a settee and coffee table, so much better than having to sit on the bed.
there was a coffee pod machine, plenty of tea bags, and a bottle of water each in the mini fridge.  
The bedding was fresh and white, we both enjoyed our sleep, the beds were really comfy.
Beautiful view of London at night.
The shower was quite good too, the only issue i did see was the toilet was cracked and a tile was missing on the wall.
We did eat at there restaurant,  all the staff couldn't do enough for us . we wasn't waiting too long for the food  either.
The food was wonderful, and well worth the money we paid.
We finished off in the cocktail bar for one of their speciality cocktails.
We would both go back again,  My husband now wants to go, im happy with that.
See you again soon Sunborn.",5,2022,10,17
119,brilliant…,"fantastic location, slightly different experience to just a hotel, it’s a Yacht lol…. Loved the whole place and the staff were very friendly. Rooms were ample, clean and tidy.

The evening meal and drinks selection was excellent, we had such a great time with both restaurant managers, what a laugh…",5,2022,10,15
119,Awful,"As title says, don’t bother, waste of money when a Premier Inn is miles better. Firstly they got the booking wrong and booked me on the wrong day, refused a refund and threatened a penalty if cancelled, so i’ve had to pay £200 for a room for the CORRECT day I asked for, staff were rude and unhelpful in resolving, rooms are motel standard at best, bathrooms shoddy and grim, room decor is outdated and half our light switches didn’t work. All for a 4/5* price. Don’t bother. Looks fancy from the outside and pictures but it’s a dump",1,2022,10,13
119,Computer or chef says no!,"Looked forward to a two night stay on the Sunborn for an event at Excel. I booked a executive room and was disappointed to be facing the shore however understand it's a busy time. What however is unacceptable is the lack of guest service. Having called room service 3 times without answer, to be told after dialing reception the line isn't staffed. Then to have the restaurant put the phone down on me.  Finally after going through reception, who were great and requesting something off the evening room service menu, a simple ham and cheese toastie, I was told the kitchen was unable to prepare it at 8.15 because ""they were not prepared"" and can't make that until 10pm. They can however offer burgers,  fish and chips and other meals.

119,Birthday Visit,"We stayed at the Sunborn Yacht Hotel for one night for a birthday celebration. We had VIP tickets to see Robbie Williams at the O2 and travelled there on the London Cable car, which offered fantastic views of the city.   We were very pleasantly surprised to receive a complementary room upgrade to a river view executive room.  The room was lovely with balloons, birthday banner and birthday cake. The staff were all so professional and helpful. We couldn’t have asked for more. We would highly recommend the Sunborn.",5,2022,10,11
119,WOW WOW & WOW Again,"What an absolute treasure in the heart of London.  From the moment we stepped on board the reception staff was so lovely and welcoming, which already made our smiles even bigger.
The room was delightful with a glorious view especially waking up on an Autumn morning.
A decadent stay overall.",5,2022,10,11
119,5 * experience.,"5 star experience, great staff, delicious breakfast and a beautiful room. Excellent value for London. Close to the centre with the cable cars right on your doorstep. A wonderful surprise. I highly recommend this yacht hotel and would definitely stay here again.",5,2022,10,09
119,A fun hotel and excellent accommodation.,"Very easy to find as it’s the only big white yacht next to excel!
Reception staff both welcoming and professional. We had a room or is that a cabin with a dock view and a small peak of the millennium dome in the distance from the balcony. It was surprisingly large and spacious. The bathroom had underfloor heating which was a great feature.
We’ve paid twice as much in other London locations, for far less comfortable accommodation, so sunburn London is  is very high on our list of excellent places to stay. If your talking at an Event in Excel, or even just visiting the venue you really can’t beat the location. If you fancy a trip into,central London the Elizabeth line (customs House station) is less 10 mins walk away.
We ate out, so can’t comment on what the dining is like. However we can say the breakfast buffet was all good and plentiful and well staffed.
Being a yacht moored to a harbour side it comes as no surprise it doesn’t have integral parking. Excel has plenty of parking and there are options to book private parking nearby.
The communal areas are full of bright polished metal work, so sunglasses might be in order for some.
Not sure about comments about it being cold because it’s steel sat in cold water, it was plenty warm enough and we didn’t have the radiator on.
Overall excellent value for money and no hesitation about staying again or recommending to others.",5,2022,10,09
119,Fab stay!,"An amazing stay at Sunborn for our 4 year anniversary.

Staff were lovely and helpful. Very quick check in, rooms spacious and lovely, we had a room with a balcony facing the river which was a bonus. 

Good facilities, proper coffee machine!!  Robes in the room are an additional bonus🫶🏻

Things to note:

A £40 deposit is taken for any damages on arrival.
Heated floors in the bathroom makes it hot!!😂
Restaurant although lovely and food fab ..extremely pricey and there are many restaurants around. 

The breakfast included is fantastic, great standard/quality of food.

Would recommend!",5,2022,10,07
119,Horrible,"Dont go, there are better hotels neaby.  also what thay dont tell you is you need to leave £40 depost via credit card in case you mess up the room (damage). reception staff not pleasent.
Asked about neaby cafes to vist was told non neaby , that was a lie.",1,2022,10,07
119,"Super Pristine, Super Staff, an all round Super Yacht Stay!","I absolutely loved my stay here. The staff are so polite and go above and beyond to see that their guests are happy. The rooms are so clean and smell it too, polished wood and crisp sheets. Would definitely recommend and will be returning for another stay! Thank you to all at Sunborn for making my Birthday much more special!",5,2022,10,04
119,Great stay at this lovely hotel,"We enjoyed a fabulous meal and very comfortable nights stay here. Great location for the o2 and the Excel. Staff are polite and very professional. The food was excellent and the bed so comfortable. I would definitely recommend.
",5,2022,10,03
119,Cool place to stay,"What a great hotel!!

It's actually purpose built as a hotel (so it hasn't actually ever sailed anywhere!) and it's also bolted well and truly to the dock so the good news for land lubbers like us is... it doesn't move!)

We had an Executive room with a river view which was definitely worth the extra few £s. Rooms are comfortable and ours had a balcony with a couple of chairs which was great for tea with a view in the morning!

If was being picky, could do with some better quality coffee capsules (Nespresso machine, however coffee capsules should really walk the plank!) :). A decent smart TV would also take it up a notch as would a slightly quieter air-con. Apart from that, bed was really comfortable, spacious and good value.

Breakfast was decent quality too (but o always say you can tell the real quality of a hotel by its orange juice!.... Ag could do with upping this a note + overall it was a great stay and we’d definitely recommend!",5,2022,10,02
119,Lovely stay,"From the moment we got on the yacht hotel we were very impressed. Staff very nice, room with balcony river view just as we expected, dinner in the restaurant & drinks very good and the best buffet breakfast - would stay again",5,2022,10,01
119,An expensive Bar. ,This hotel masquerading as a boat provided a nice location in London. Access by the local tube is excellent and provided a simple small walk. Reception is gained by a lift which proved erratic and was easily overloaded. Drinks on this boat is expensive and the price of the cocktails require a mortgage. Late night views are good an one can take in some of the London sites. The breakfast is OK but I found it lacking in heat. This was a nice place to stop but the drinks prices meant that we did not socialise in the bar.,3,2022,09,28
119,Not on the same level as Sunborn in Gibraltar,"Having had a wonderful experience on the yacht in Gibraltar it was our first choice to stay when going to see The Abba Voyage.  Same friends joined us for 2 nights, we had high expectations following our previous Sunborn stay.    The access was immediately let down by low level of cleanliness.  the reception was beautiful, but we were not greeted by friendly staff or a lovely glass of champagne.  Absolutely no interest was shown to us or our friends who had arrived an hour earlier!.  my card was deducted of 40.00 for no apparent reason.  room was good and the bed very comfortable, view would have been good if window was clean !

Service in the bar was terrible, we were told we would have table service but despite the bar being very quiet we had to go to request service again after 10 minutes of waiting, the prices are higher than average which is fine if the service meets the high cost, it doesn't.

we had been told and was written on our key card that breakfast was 7am till 11am, we arrived 10 30am to be told the restaurant was closed, we explained and were allowed to eat but this was while food was being hastily taken from the serving area.  other couples were in the same situation of being given the wrong times ,  the next morning we arrived on time but saw couples being turned away at 1 minute past 10am. 

The reality is that training issues and quite possibly staffing levels are not good.  one or two members of staff were polite and welcoming but the reception staff are clearly bored and lacking any customer facing skills .  
The comparison to these two yachts is vast, we have already decided that we would prefer to board a plane and go to The Sunborn in Gibraltar next time.",3,2022,09,28
119,Birthday treat!,"Stayed on board just one night but was beautiful…gorgeous surroundings and helpful staff. Very comfortable room… had a fab few days for my husband’s birthday.
Very different type of break…was looking to do something original",5,2022,09,26
119,"avoid at all costs, overpriced, lack of customer service and rude staff.","we stayed here as a party of 3 people for my friends birthday.
we had 2 rooms.
one room was upgraded and when we saw how nice my friends room was we asked for an upgrade(even pay the difference)
the receptionist stated the boat was fully booked.

i checked on booking.com who i booked with and there was loads of availability including the upgrades, so i was lied to as they could not be bothered to change the room.

we went for dinner having high expectations, even though they knew it was my friends birthday the staff in the restaurant put zero effort into her stay.
served by miserable waiters and waitresses. 

we were served by someone with serious body odour that completely put us off our meal, made us all feel pretty ill as the stench lingered in the restaurant well after he had left our plates.

we mentioned this to KARIM who was dismissive of our concerns, he did seem to offer some desserts complimentary, but then still put this on our bill.
we could not wait to leave the restaurant i have no idea what other diners must have thought as the smell was overwhelming.
how can the staff not smell this?
serving food to customers and yet having bad hygiene is not on.
so much so, we refused to have breakfast there in the morning.

on paying the bill i tried to put the bill on my room, as stated on my booking and also in the room leaflet.
KARIM was rude and aggressive to me demanding i pay now, i explained my card was in my room and tried to show him my booking confirmation and that i had already had pre-authorised account as £40 had been deducted from my card.
he would not accept this and became combative in the restaurant full of guests and my friends. completely ruining my friends birthday.

i asked for the general managers name and he said ""complain, he's in Liverpool and not here at the moment, get on with it""

i have never felt so offended by a member of staff behaviour,
eventually Patricia got involved and went down and spoke to reception and they stated i could put this to my room and pay on check out.

i will NEVER return here and i WILL NOT be recommending to friends and family.
i wrote an email to the hotel and they couldn't even be bothered to reply.",1,2022,09,25
119,2* Hotel at 5* prices!,"Arrived to check in to a family room, 1st impressions of the lobby were very nice. Went to reception and staff were ok and they got us our key and chared a £40 payment to my card (dont why). Went to our room and noticed it was very hot, within an hr our room temp was reading 27°c!! We went to complain on our way out for the evening to be told someone will fix it in our absence. We returned around 9:30pm and went to get a drink from the bar, 2 small cokes and a bottle of cider cost £17 so we had one drink and left, the bar was empty and im guessing that's why as it was incredibly over priced . Went back to our room and within the hr the room temp was 28°c! I went to complain again, to be told they couldn't change our room as they had no family rooms left, and if I wanted an executive room(only room left) I would have to pay the upgrade price!! When I refused to pay extra the staff member Went and got someone else. They also tried to say I had to pay for the other room even though it is their fault, at this point I asked to cancel my reservation all together and we would just leave. The the staff then agreed to the new room and I went to tell my family. We arrived in the new room around midnight with our son and got straight to sleep. In the morning we noticed broken plug sockets, damaged balcony door, eggy smell from the bathroom and our shower drain was blocked! We packed and left the room and went to check out. The receptionist simply took the keys and walked away no conversation or asking about the stay (we were the only people in reception at the time). will definitely never return.",1,2022,09,25
119,Sunborn hotel,"Amazing hotel, somewhere unique. Helpful staff, even took photos for us.  Room spotlessly clean, great views. Close to links to get into central London. Great location if visiting O2. Highly recommend. Great local pubs, and restaurants.  Near to amirates cable car and excellent centre. Breakfast well worth the money. Would visit again. Damage deposit is taken, but paid back within 2 hours of our departure.",5,2022,09,18
119,Exceedingly Disappointed ,"3pm check in clearly a known busy time so why only have 2 people on the desk creating queues. The staff seemed fake & uninterested. The romantic package isn't worth the value. We upgraded to a balcony view (definitely reccomend this) however chipped bathroom sink wasn't expected & the balcony was dirty. The beds were very hard & uncomfortable (just my opinion). We waited 20 mins in the bar for our mocktails to be made & served when no one else was in there so this was our first concern! As for the restaurant the tables were too close, you had barely sat down when you needed to order everything as quote ""they were very busy"" you were offered main the minute u had finished, & just made to feel an inconvenience & everything was rushed. Personally with over 20 years customer care experience & some of that in hotels this was a disappointment & I wouldn't return.
They are relying on the brand & image rather than focusing on exceeding customer care. 
",2,2022,09,18
119,Amazing stay,"What can I say, excellent all the way.
Staff were very friendly and helpful, we had afternoon tea aboard which was to die for. The rooms are so big and comfortable and very clean. The boat is easily accessible to most attractions surrounding the docklands. The decor is traditional and unique giving it the glamorous feel. Thankyou sunborn for a memorable stay, will definitely be going back again.",5,2022,09,18
119,Amazing customer service,I was staying at the sunborn for a corporate event. Olesia and Eury went above and beyond to make it a fantastic experience. I can’t praise them enough! Thank you for everything you helped ensure the conference ran as best as it could,5,2022,09,14
119,Disappointing experience took the edge off.,"Paid £200 for a river view room without breakfast, travelling with my wife for a night out without the children.

Check-in was a bizarre experience. Arrived around 2pm and, upon enquiring if we were able to store our luggage in case our room was not ready, the receptionist took and labelled our bag without checking the status of our room (or even that we had a reservation). We advised we needed to fetch some shoes out, at which point she disappeared.

Another couple arrived after us, and proceeded to check in with no issues, straight into their rooms, whilst we stood around waiting for our response receptionist to return. During this time, the queue was rapidly forming.

Eventually, after 5 or 6 minutes, the sole receptionist was forced to head into the back office and retrieve our original receptionist to help deal with the backlog. We enquired if our room was actually ready, which it was, so we were able to check in straight away. This bizarre experienced could've been avoided if our receptionist had actually checked, and then not abandoned her colleague.

In the room (on 2nd floor), it was clean enough - though the window was so dirty from the outside, it made it difficult to see out and enjoy the view. Also, in the morning, we discovered that the coffee pod machine didn't work.

There was also a lack of UK sockets maybe 2 in the room total, with plenty of European sockets. This meant awkwardly trying to arrange the kettle (and defective coffee machine) on the built-in suitcase stand, as this was the only accessible socket.

All in all, great location and setting. But let down by the check-in experience and room facilities, which we'd expect more for the high quality of hotel. ",3,2022,09,13
119,Not 5 star luxury,"We stayed on the Yacht for a birthday treat for my husband, we had tickets to the boxing at the o2, his event was cancelled but we decided to still go ahead with our weekend anyway, the yacht was not cheap so we were expecting 5 star luxury, but this was not the case.
Pro’s
Reception  and bar area we beautiful, some reception staff were friendly, bar staff very friendly
Con’s
As we walked towards the yacht it looked tired, we thought that the shabby windows were having work done on them, but this wasn’t the case.
Reception staff friendly, we arrived early and we were able to leave our bags until check in at 3pm, we were advised that the yacht was fully booked and would be best to check in much later the 3pm, if not there would be long queues, not a great experience.
Our room was large with a lovely river view, but that’s where the positives end, we had to move all the tea and coffee items to be able to plug them in, there was no info in the room for room service, breakfast or any of the surrounding area. We might have stayed for breakfast but we had no idea about price or opening times, a missed opportunity to up sell products.
The bathroom let the room down badly, mould in the shower and a completely broken shower, once the shower was turned on it completely soaked me, and I was standing outside of the shower cubical and it also flooded the floor, I would expect house keeping to report these type of issues.
Check out was very impersonal, we were told just to put the key in the box, not even asked how was our stay, bad customer service.
We also spent some time in the bar on the Saturday evening, this was a complete shambles, people were waiting for at least half an hour to get served, there is table service only and people had to keep going to the bar to remind the staff that they were still waiting to order, we saw lots of people just leaving as they gave up waiting, the drinks where very over priced too, the bar closed at 12pm and no mention of the bar closing at last orders of 11.30, even residence could not get another drink.

We are going back to the o2 in a couple of weeks and I would definitely not return to this hotel/yacht",2,2022,09,11
119,Fantastic hotel,Stayed at this fantastic hotel in August for 3 nights arrived about an hour before check in so had to wait about 30 minutes so sat down and had a drink reception staff called us over when room was ready we were also given an upgrade. The room was nice and clean and a good size with a king size bed nice size balcony with chairs some people were complaining about the height of the balcony but what they have to remember is it’s a ship and was built so you didn’t fall overboard. The shower is big enough for three people. Breakfast is excellent with a good choice of food and drinks. Staff are very friendly and helpful. Enjoyed it that much we have booked again for October,5,2022,09,07
119,"Great size rooms, booking system let us down","We visited this hotel, very spacious rooms, we were blown away! We got a room with a balcony and it was lush! - However the booking system let us down.

When we booked the room online we paid - yet when we got there they wanted payment again - I had to show my bank statements for proof.

On top of this I had to give a card for pre auth checks - though I had already paid. It  all got a little messy, chaotic and stressful - was not a good start. Eventually it got cleared and offered free of charge as an apology. 

We got the room service breakfast which we were a bit confused over what items were allowed - we went down to reception and they told us we could order what we wanted for a set price. However when we got the bill we were charged way more than it should have been - Turns out the items are individually priced and not a set price for a certain amount of items So we were given the wrong information. 

The hotel were very good about this and cleared the breakfast charge too - so it was all handled well - just not a great impression and a bit messy and stressful - as at the time we were on a budget and so much money ended up leaving our cards - or so we thought it would before it was waivered.

I would visit again as the rooms are gorgeous - I felt like a VIP - however I'd be wary about the booking system and maybe book another way.",3,2022,09,06
119,Something different ,"Really enjoyed a recent 2 night stay.
Room with balcony recommended, lovely to watch the world go by at night.
Very comfortable room and bed.

Check in was poor, very slow. 
Generally staff were very good and friendly.",4,2022,09,05
119,Average  and partly satisfactory stay,"I decided to stay in this hotel as  a couple of years back,I  had seen it and  put it on my  to do list.The check in was pretty straight forward . We  booked a classic family room, which we were given.Being a party of three,I was  expecting a bed and possibly a sofa bed. The was  a sofa in the picture of the  room on website,which I wrongly assumed was a sofa bed.The was only one  bed in the room,which made our sleep very uncomfortable.I asked a member of staff about it,he said he would check and come back to me. He never did.The  TV did not work and the receptionist nonechanlantly told me, 'the engineer was  working on it'.It never worked until we left.The Wifi service was  so poor, it was a struggle to use it.A part of the curtain in the room was off the hooks ,making it hard to pull across.The curtains were also stained.The phone in tne room did not work.They did increase the number of toiletries provided, when I explained we were a  party of three.The room was  spacious and close to the staff/emergency exit so we  could occasionally hear the thuds from the exit.We had booked for one night in anticipation of staying for another  night, but we kind of figured out it simply was not wroth it.Some staff were pleasant whilst others slightly aloof ,I guess they did not want to bothered by the guest.Breakfast was good .We had it nice and early. so we could go home  and sleep properly.I would advise other people to look for discounted deals on other  websites such as groupon , if you want to book this  hotel,as paying the full price is not wroth it.",3,2022,08,31
119,Different Stay in London,"Definitely worth a visit if you fancy something different in London. My boyfriend booked us a night for my birthday and the hotel looks really beautiful.

Our room was spacious and clean. The service at the bar was very good too and we loved having a drink on the balcony, Such a great view.

Overall, we had a great time, everyone was helpful. But a bit disappointing at the end to check out. I waited for ages while my BF was driving around as we could not find anywhere to park.

Someone was checking in and their friends arrived. Well, in  they jumped the queue in front of everyone with their 'mates'. The receptionist did not make a peep and graciously served them. It took forever. I reckon I waited 15 min just to get our luggage. To say money doesn't buy class is quite an understatement! They should have asked those noisy customers to wait like everyone else...",4,2022,08,30
119,Lovely Overnight Stay,"We rang and checked first to see if they would look after our bags before check-in and after check-out, so we arrived at 11am to drop the bags off before heading to the O2 for  day out.

Our group of 6 returned at around 4pm and we were able to check in quickly and retrieve our bags.

We did not eat at the hotel, but had drinks in the bar before going out to dinner and on the afterdeck on returning. It was a very warm evening, so really lovely to sit outside watching the twinkling lights on the water.  Drinks were expensive, but I think this is to be expected at a hotel.

The rooms were really big, with a sofa and a balcony with two seats. The barrier was too high to sit in the chairs and see anything, but we could stand and have a glass of wine overlooking the river. The bed was extremely comfortable and we slept very well.

We all really enjoyed out stay and would return again.",5,2022,08,30
119,Fabulous stay,Stayed overnight and we had a fabulous experience. Staff were very friendly and helpful and the rooms were more than we expected. The breakfast was also gorgeous with a fantastic choice available. Highly recommend fir stays in London as was exceptional value for money.,5,2022,08,26
119,35th Wedding Anniversary stay,"I booked this stay for our 35th Wedding Anniversary.  The room was clean and spacious.  The breakfast buffet was fabulous.  The interior of the yacht was amazing and loved the glass chandelier in the centre of the staircase.  The chocolates in the room was a nice touch.  Just wished that there had been an acknowledgment of our Wedding Anniversary in some way as reception were advised it was our 35th in emails to them.  Nevertheless, we had a memorable time.",5,2022,08,25
119,Disappointed big time.,"Having seen the hotel from outside whilst visiting excel 2 years back, had always dreamt of staying here , was like a bucket list.so had managed to book it like 6 months back as a surprise for my husband on his birthday. Walking towards it on the bridge, the hotel looked so elegant and we were so excited but all of it sort of vanished once we entered the hotel and reached the reception at 3:15 pm to join a long queue for check in! Definitely not a five star welcome. Another family complained that there were glasses there buy no water!! Obviously needed some after an half an hr wait in the queue! I had booked the executive River View and was on the 5th floor where you need a key to enter. It took us more then 10 mina to open this lock!! It said wait for 6 secs before you take the key out but apparently you needed to swipe the key .even the receptionist told us to be patient. Finally another staff came and said you don't need to wait just jerk it out!! Anyway we finally gor ro our room at 4 . the photos of the rooms are deceiving on their website as it shows a bath tub which we were looking forward to but there was a small shower instead!! After flushing the toilet there was a terrible stench and the smell which didnt go. Another thing we were looking forward to was sitting in the lobby and enjoying the river view however the balcony metal is so high that if you are sitting you can't see the view so Another disappointment. Then we visited the overpriced bar which was OK. Next day we went for oir breakfast where a rather unfriendly guy welcomed us and have us a list where we needed to tick only 1 thing!! How luxurious! And weren't even told that we can get a cappuccino. And we were told unlimited buffet which includes toast crossaint and cereal and yogurt..seriously! Even holiday Inn has better breakfast. So basically my expectations were quite high considering the price I had paid but all shattered to pieces..laughed at myself. Really this was on my bucket list !!!",2,2022,08,25
119,Luxurious looking but lacks lustre,"The views from the yacht are lovely unfortunately the restaurant lets itself down with staff who do not know how to serve in a 5* setting. Asking if we want our mains as soon as we had finished starters, dropping food on the table when serving us. We asked if they had fillet steak served as a single portion rather than the surf and turf to share, we were met with “it’s steak you know meat” when I started to explain ribeye is different from fillet I stopped talking what’s the point explaining to them ?!? The starters were nice but the lobster tagliatelle was tasteless and I left a nice bit of shell on the side on the plate for chef to see and the ribeye that we were served was flavourless. 

Great for drinks and to sit on the deck to watch the sunset but give the restaurant a miss. Overly priced and not up to scratch sorry.",2,2022,08,24
119,Really disappointed,"Really disappointed with our stay , My sister , mum and I had planned a trip to London specifically to stay at this hotel. On arrival to our room we were greeted with a horrible smell of sewage while a man pumped something from a cupboard next to our room , the smell reappeared the next morning. Entering our room the temperature was unbelievable hot , We quickly left the room to go out and explore thinking we were hot because of all our travelling , however this was not the case returning to the room to get ready to head to the bar we realised our room was still extremely hot however we were here to enjoy ourselves and decided to sit tight and just try get a good night sleep , however we woke up in the night unwell due to the heat of the room and it was almost like a heat stroke with the heat making me physically sick , my mum also has a heart condition and the temperature of the room was not a safe environment for her. 

Lack of thought also went into the room set up , the room was booked for 3 people however there were 2 of everything in the room e.g 2 cups , 2 glasses which i felt was really disappointing.

Overall the experience at the hotel was horrible , we tried to ignore the room set up , wear and tear in the room and the smell , but we physically could not take the heat , in the morning after my 3rd visit to reception they gave us a new room , which was cool , so for our last 2 hours of our stay we managed to get ready without sweating buckets. The yatch certainly isn’t luxurious, the reception area and bar are beautiful however the rest of the yatch does lack attention.",1,2022,08,23
119,Beautiful treasure on our doorstep,"Booked this as a surprise for my partners 40th birthday as we were going to gaucho’s for his fav steak and the hotel was close enough to make the o2 easily accessible…I have to say this was the best decision I made! The hotel was beautiful from start to finish, I’d emailed in advance to ask if they could decorate the room and there were so many options and they also tailored it to my specifications. My partner was over the moon, on arrival we were excited to see how stunning and clean the reception was and the room then didn’t disappoint (the bed was very comfy!) we have never stayed somewhere so immaculately clean. We booked b&b which I enjoyed a cold buffet breakfast and my partner the cooked breakfast, we also spent time in the bar after our meal at the o2 and sat on the deck and inside and the service was second to none. The only one thing I could put as something to improve is the bar for drinks isn’t open between breakfast and 12pm…. So there was an hour where we had gone to go have a cold soft drink out on the deck and we couldn’t… however this wouldn’t put me off going back… I can’t wait to visit again soon..",5,2022,08,17
119,Afternoon tea ,"Myself and my partner visited for his 60th birthday having been given a voucher . We were late but the staff were really helpful and we had a most enjoyable afternoon .
The staff were very attentive and the food selection was really nice .
Would recommend ",5,2022,08,16
119,Excellent stay,"We stayed for one night to celebrate a birthday and had a beautiful, comfortable and spacious executive dockside room with a balcony.  This was really nice to have a drink in the evening and people watch and have your tea/coffee in the morning.  

The bathroom had towels / toiletries provided and also bathrobes and slippers. Complimentary water, tea and coffee were provided and the Nespresso was not easy to use. 

We had breakfast included which was fine, only thing we found strange is they did not have any cheese (wanted smoked salmon and cream cheese).

Overall the staff were great and attentive, we thoroughly enjoyed our stay and had an exceptional time.  The hotel is very close (around  10 minutes) to public transport links. We used the emirates cable car on our way back which was fun.  We would definitely stay here again!!",4,2022,08,15
119,Great experience,"When we arrived we were given our room, dock side, as it was a special occasion we asked if we could move to a river side cabin.  This was sorted for us really quickly and we were moved with no fuss.  Beautiful cabin with lovely views day and night over the river. The evening meal was lovely with a very good selection on the menu.
The staff were very friendly and helpful.
The only thing that dropped my rating was breakfast, it had been cooked some time and left under heaters to dry out.
Overall I would recommend staying and would stay again myself.",4,2022,08,15
119,We had a lovely stay,We stayed for 1 night with breakfast included. We had a river view room which was lovely. The staff were very friendly and always greeted with a hello and a smile. The breakfast was also very good with a good choice. We would highly recommend a stay here. Lovely experience,5,2022,08,14
119,MadDog goes back to the east end,"The MadDogs stayed here in the middle of July for part of Mrs M's birthday celebrations. (Which have been going on since April)?
We only stayed for one night ,but as we live quite near we could pop home for a cuppa! Seriously this is a very nice ship/yacht ,very clean well decorated and staffed by nice people. 
Mrs M wanted a balcony so we upgraded from what was our Wowcher (MadDog loves a bargain) and for a reasonable supplement found ourselves with a 'River View'. MadDog knows its not the River itself, but its a nice view and it was nice sitting out in the sun with a drink watching the sun going down.
Room/Cabin was nice and well maintained, comfy and air conned with an excellent bed .Mrs MadDog likes her bed so all was good. Didn't have problems with sockets at all. The plumbing was a bit slow to drain but that's because the  pipes on a ship are narrow to save space so........MadDog took the Queen shilling a long time ago and knows this sort of thing. Anyways the bathroom was well presented as well as the room .

They have a good reception area which got a bit full at three o'clock for obvious reasons . We arrived by DLR just at that time so sat it out for 10 mins on a sofa and eyed up the chandelier, wondering how we were going to get it home?
Didn't have dinner on board but our deal was with breakfast which was excellent. Bit surprised that not many people wanted to sit outside on the sundeck as it was a lovely morning. Staff were run off their feet and from MadDogs past experiences in the Hospitality industry would say they needed two more staff the make the room work efficiently. Full marks to the tall slim lad who worked well under pressure. One full English and one smoked salmon later and the world was good.
Had some drinks at the bar.Yes a bit pricy but you are in London and hotel prices are steep . The view over the back end from the bar Terrace was more than worth it. 

The MadDogs ate out locally which wasn't that cheap either but there is plenty to choose from locally. Somewhat surprised that there is quite a bit going on locally so even for one night we had a blast. 

One small niggle, the coffee machine in the room churns out the most gopping coffee ever. Tried both pods but sorry no good. Needs a Kuerig machine from the states, no fuss just good coffee

MadDog says, ""Heave Ho you Lubbers"".",5,2022,08,14
119,Weekend,Absolutely fabulous place. Staff where fantastic food was excellent. Great location. Near everything. Recommend getting cable car to the other side of the Thames and the Uber water taxi to Westminster. 2 minute walk from the ship. Will definitely be back. Best experience I had in years. So relaxing,5,2022,08,14
119,A part of London hidden luxury,An amazing hotel experience. Couldn’t have asked for a nicer location to celebrate our wedding anniversary. Great customer service with a smile. Making the time spent a truly pleasant one. The size of our cabin was surprisingly large.,5,2022,08,13
119,"Fantastic stay, fantastic staff.","We have just stayed aboard the Sunborn, 7th/8th August (Room 3020)

From the moment we arrived to check in, the receptionist, Paula, did everything she could to ensure our stay was going to be a good one. When I asked about a complimentary upgrade (I noticed on the hotel's website, they're sometimes
available) she went to considerable time and trouble to accommodate us. 
Because we had to wait for the new room to be prepared she sat us in the bar with a couple or glasses of prosecco. Her approach-fullness and friendliness made a real impact on us. She is a credit to the company.

That said, we were very impressed by all the staff with whom we had contact.

The room was spacious and very clean. The bed and sofa were comfortable and the room was generally very well appointed. We dined in the Sundown bar and enjoyed a couple of the best burgers we've had in a long time. 
The tomato salsa was to die for. Breakfast was also excellent.

All in all a faultless stay made all the better by the hotel staff and Paula in particular.",4,2022,08,12
119,Perfect in every way!,"We spent one night at the Sunborn London as we had a very early morning flight from London City Airport. We opted to stay here as we are regular customers to the Sunborn in Gibraltar which is marvellous. We were not disappointed with the sister Ship in London. 
Check-in was easy and a special mention goes to Eury and Matthew who went out of their way to make us feel so welcome as loyal customers to the Sunborn brand. 
Everywhere was immaculately clean, our room was amazing overlooking the Thames and we were able to watch the planes come down the Thames in their flight path to London City Airport. 
The Sunborn London is perfectly placed for the ExCel Centre and there are plenty of bars and restaurants in the immediate vicinity. 
Overall, a fabulous stay and would highly recommend.",5,2022,08,11
119,Stunning hotel with a beautiful room and great food.,"Beautiful room in a stunning hotel. Staff were great and went over and above to ensure customer satisfaction. We ate in the bar after having a drink on the outside deck. Our room was spacious, very quiet with a fabulous river view. We’ll definitely return at some point soon.",5,2022,08,10
119,Not up to the fabulous ratings previously given,"Specially selected to celebrate our wedding anniversary as reviews were so good. I have written formally to complain, so the management had plenty of time to respond, saying I would give an honest opinion on TripAdvisor if I had not received a reply. I have not heard back.
Service here is AWFUL. Stayed from Friday through to Sunday and at every meal time the service was shocking. Afternoon tea, although very nice, was totally spoilt by the service. Saturday breakfast was so slow, we had to complain. Sunday morning was so quick, we had to complain. So on each of the 3 days, we had a poor experience. On checkout we were asked for feedback, which we gave and although an apology was given, we were told they would make it up to us on our return. We said we would NOT return, and nothing more was said.  Nice room, but standard of cleaning fell short. If you book, be prepared for them not to be customer focused. Very very disappointed",3,2022,08,10
119,"Dinner, Bed and Breakfast Deal","Booked Sunborn hotel deal through Groupon. £300 for 1 night bed, breakfast and 3 course evening meal for 2 in a superior room.
Hotel itself quite nice, room was large although bathroom very small. We had a balcony but unfortunately our outlook was the Excel Centre!!
Bar prices extortionate. We paid £37 for a bottle of Rose in the restaurant and when we googled the wine it was £4.25 in Asda! Bar wanted £13 for a double spirit (all doubles although menu stated you could ask for a single) £4.50 for mixer and a 12.5% charge added at the end to cover the waiter service !!!
The boat itself isn’t close to other bars and restaurants really so we felt a bit out on a limb !
Comfortable bed but I wouldn’t stay here again",3,2022,08,09
119,Awful,"Loud, other customers smoking drugs which set off a fire alarm in the middle of the night, pushed me to upgrade my room which i refused, took a deposit on top of my bill & took weeks to come back, someone came to my room at midnight demanding i paid before my stay finished- avoid at all costs if you want good service & a good night's sleep! ",1,2022,08,09
119,Lovely location,"Staff were not particularly customer focused and in some cases actually quite rude. Not one smile from anybody who worked there other than the cleaners. Was asked to give this review seconds after 2 staff member blanked me.

Location is nice, rooms good however if you want people to come back you need to treat your customers a little more personably. I've no problem with an accent but some of the reception staff lack even basic English and just say a word louder rather than clearer.",3,2022,08,08
119,My 60th birthday treat,"We have just returned from a 2 night stay to celebrate my 60th birthday, arrived a little early for check in so went to the bar and had a drink and a nice burger and chips, bar food was lovely and good value for money, room was spacious, we booked a river view as a treat, room was clean, tea, coffee and biscuits, very nice. We booked a meal in the restaurant in the evening, we had a woucher, £88 for 2 people including a glass of Prosecco, was told Friday and Saturday nights there was a £20 supplement each, I shows the manager the conditions on the vouchers and he had to waive the supplement as it clearly said Monday to Sunday 5pm to 9pm, we chose the steak which was lovely, cheese board was huge. Breakfast on both mornings was superb, lots of choices. We went to see a show next day and when we came back we went to the bar, there was no non alcaholic  beer left, my husband is not allowed to drink alcohol as he has a terminal brain condition, we are not sure how long he has to live, he can’t drink mocktails as they are too sweet, again because if his condition, we went to our room rather disappointed, the waitress was lovely she kept apologising as we told her my husband has a terminal illness and isn’t allowed to drink alcohol, she offered him a tonic water, her name was Sonia she was very pleasant and attentive as all the staff were. We hope to come back again, if we can. It was just a shame on the last day as there was nothing he could drink. Thankyou for a nice couple of days xx",5,2022,08,07
119,Will not return again,"Second time staying for my husband and I , as it will be our year anniversary on Monday we decided to come back as we stayed for a mini moon just after getting married in aug, so disappointing the room was dirty had to report to reception, it did get cleaned-sort of! Still hair in bed and dust on shelves in bathroom, smears on mirror, I run a cleaning firm so expect it to be clean!  Bathroom looked like a ibis hotel not a £200 per night room. Reception were so slow and unhelpful I asked to be upgraded and I would pay but they were fully booked so couldn’t even change rooms, we over looked the excel building on to concrete( last time were the otherside on the Thames ) fine we got ready to go for dinner, got to the table with beautiful  views but slow service, no water even after 10 mins of waiting, tried scallops tasted like gammon fat, awful, then had the tomato and mozzarella salad with side chips and baby potatoes which were both nice, my husband had steak which was all fat he left half of it, ordered desert to take back to room but ended up just eating it as we’re waiting so long for tea and bill, mentioned to reception but no apologies we will not return again",2,2022,08,06
119,Honeymoon at sunborn london,"*Disabled Friendly* No steps in or out. Slight step to the external decking area. Staff were wonderful and informative. Breakfast was included for us and more than we needed till the evening tbh. Full English, selection of cereals, fruit, toast, pastries etc. Again all level access from lift. Had a small issue with sliding door of shower and maintenance were on it with 4/5min. Very quick. Room service also super quick. Room cleaning was optional and Victoria was lovely. The sound insulation is incredible considering the volume from planes flying overhead every 10min. Room was comfortable and spacious. Overall... 100% recommend! Thank you guys for a wonderful honeymoon stay",5,2022,08,04
119,5* service,"Excellent service from start to finish. My husband is a lecturer in catering,and I've worked in hospitality for 30+ years. We couldn't fault this beautiful hotel. Prices were ok by us for the attentive service we received. Highly recommend. Will be booking again in October. Luxury on my doorstep.",5,2022,08,04
119,Stay,"The stay from start to finish was absolutely amazing, I paid extra to pay balloons and a banner for my boyfriends 21st birthday and the set up was amazing in the room, loved every minute of it, the room was very spacious and the bed was very comfy",5,2022,08,04
119,Really enjoyable stay,"The hotel was excellent and reasonably priced (for London).  I would recommend upgrading to a view with a balcony and was happy to get this also at a reasonable price.

The restaurant and the bar were both very good and the atmosphere excellent.

The staff were very attentive and polite.  

The location is great for the Excel Centre and there are a good variety of restaurants nearby.",5,2022,08,04
119,Dinner at Lands End restaurant,"Took my Mum (75) for dinner on a Wowcher deal.  From start to finish, we were treated like royalty, Staff were so attentive, especially Patricia.  The food was absolutely amazing, we had the salmon and the ham bock terrine for starters, followed by the surf and turf (£20 supplement) and cheese board for dessert, all washed down by a bottle of red (Mum) and Rose for me! We went to the bar after, and when it was time to go home, the two ladies on reception Grace and Paula, not only got us a taxi, took time to walk both Mum and I (who were tiddly lol) to where the taxi picks you up, they didn't need to do that, but we were so grateful as not a clue where we were going.  All in all, a wonderful experience, that I highly recommend!",5,2022,07,31
119,Sunborne stay ," A truly amazing experience with excellent facilities and very polite and helpful staff....10 stars  
I would highly recommend this very unique hotel...fabulous 
I especially liked the restaurant and the fact that there was a lift from.the Quay to the reception 

",5,2022,07,30
119,Part of our London,We stopped here after we took the Emirates cable car from the O2. The drinks and food was great. Perfection. Thought I was cruising for awhile without the price and feeling the motion of the ocean. Price was within expectations and reasonable.,5,2022,07,27
119,Disappointed  guests.,"As a worker in catering and hospitality  i tend to notice many little things that others might miss and i certainly  did during our two day stay 1) complementary  tea/  coffee items not even up the standard of a cheap Blackpool b&b  2) toiletries  included bath foam for a room with a shower .3) bath robe had a torn pocket not the type of thing expected of a luxery hotel. 4) room not cleaned to a good standard ( something sticky on window sill,glass table smeared and marked. 5) cracked tiles on bathroom floor .6) sink in bathroom slow draing due to dirty plughole.  7 restaurant  staff need updating on their basic hygiene  training  ( tables sprayed with sanitiser then wiped  not allowing correct contact time ) one staff member used a tissue sized piece of blue roll to wipe 3 tables dropped table mat on floor and placed back on table without re sanitising brushed food onto floor 8) scraps of blue roll on floor around restaurant   9) door to kitchen was not cleaned either day of our stay ( thick greasy marks where staff plced hands to open  door . 9) breakfast  cerals in large uncovered containers  open for anyone to breath or sneeze  onto .10) other food items standing uncovered .11) quality of breakfast very poor ranging from cold to lukewarm  even after asking for food to be heated properly  12) fried eggs precooked and either not stored hot or badly reheated(cold and greasy first day ,scambled eggs cold on second day )  13) on second day one member of staff had very poor personal hygiene  standards ( very strong body odour)  overall  what looks like a great hotel let down by lots of minor irritating  problems that are down to basic hospitality  mistakes that should not be happening",1,2022,07,24
119,Disappointing ,"We had stayed here many times before and always had a nice comfy stay,  but we stayed on the 22nd July for our 20th wedding  anniversary,  when we checked in there was a 10 min wait to check I'm and when we finally  got to the desk we was told there was no room upgrade  as they where busy, (I had emailed them twice  asking for a room upgrade)
Ww got to our room which was still nice,  but in the morning  my husband  woke up in agony!! the ""DOUBLE "" bed we slept in wasn't a proper double  bed at all when we looked, it was 2 singles pushed together  with a THIN mattress  topper put over the top, it didn't even have a proper  mattress  on it!!! My husband  suffers  from back ache and had an awful night's sleep and woke up in agony!! Not exactly  what we wanted while celebrating  our anniversary  and not what I'd expect  for £172, we will not be staying here again!!.",3,2022,07,23
119,Perfect mini London getaway!,"I booked the river view suite with balcony and I was pleasantly surprised. The room was spacious and had a relaxing ambience. Service was wonderful, the lady who checked me in was very helpful in changing my room last minute so that I could have balcony. Location wonderful, view from room looking out onto the river with the O2 in the distance was a nice touch. I look forward to staying with you again and I have already recommended you to friends and family.",5,2022,07,22
119,"Don’t stay here dirty, bad customer service and no value for money","We had been given this night stay with bed and breakfast from my father who had complained last time he was here.

To be honest I see why they complained.

The staff on the front desk have no customer service skills at all would of been better being served by a robot, the rooms are so dated they need complete refurbishment to bring them up to the current times. Our room had clearly not been cleaned was covered in dust make up on the towels and the pillows and what looked like human waste on the carpet. 

Bathroom was filthy to the point I cleaned it myself before using it. 

The worst part about our stay was the restaurant. We waited ages for our drinks to arrived. Didn’t receive them till we got our main course, we had already had our starter. No water offered until I asked for it. Overall the service was awful lots of staff their just no one doing anything. I had the lobster pasta and found a massive lump of what looked like chewing gum, I gave it to the head waiter and he went to the kitchen and came back to me and said it was cheese then agreed with me it wasn’t! No replacement offered no free drinks to compensate. 

Breakfast was a bit better as completely different team, food was ok but not worth £20 each. if I was the manager I’d send all your staff on customer service training. 

The couple next to us also complained and we saw numerous people sending back food that night.

We went to the bar afterwards, my husband ordered at the bar for our drinks and got charge 12% service ? What sort of place does this? Also £8 for a pint of beer £12 for a single gin. The drinks are cheaper across the road at the fox and at the 02. 

I sent a email whilst at the hotel and yet to here any response.

Thank god we didn’t pay for our visit but we had spoke to a lot of people who had paid £450 for a night! There was a long line of people are reception asking for money back.

Don’t bother going here I have had better stays at travelodges.",1,2022,07,21
119,Something different,"Located within reach of major public transports.
Staff was very friendly and helpful.
The room was lovely, clean, tidy and spacious.
Everything was well maintained and in working order.
There wasn’t a big queue for breakfast. The food was fresh and very tasty.
Only downside is it’s not accessible by car, so you do have to walk at least 10 minutes. And unfortunately the only car park nearby is London ExCel, which is very expensive, and you need to go to your car every day to get a new ticket. Therefore I recommend you get there by public transport like DLR. The DLR is about 10 minute walk.
Check-in process at 15:00 was very slow, took 30 minutes.",5,2022,07,19
119,Loved our Stay!,"We had a lovely night here last weekend.  Cannot fault the reception staff, serving staff and housekeepers.  Everyone was very welcoming and friendly and the service was excellent.  The room was spacious and spotlessly clean.  Breakfast was great, full english cooked to perfection and excellent croissants.
Some of the reviews are saying it's expensive - it was £130 for the night (plus breakfast) compared to £110 for a Travel Lodge.  We booked a few months in advance so don't know if that made a difference.  We didn't eat there but had drinks on the deck.  Yes they're pricey but the atmosphere was wonderful and it was our holiday.  We walked to the cable cars, then from there to the clipper boat and travelled into the city that way.  All in all an excellent experience at this hotel, would recommend.",5,2022,07,19
119,Highly recommend,"Highly recommend a stay at this unique hotel. Very spacious room with a balcony overlooking the water. The room was spotless clean, staff friendly and helpful. Easy parking less than 5 minutes away at the E-cel centre for £20 for 24 hours. Genuinely couldn’t find fault with this hotel and will definitely use it again.",5,2022,07,18
119,Don't expect too much,"My expectations were very high booking this . Parked the car at excel for £20 -  24 hours which is fine . Didn't have information of parking near the hotel so arranged this . The receptionist takes £40 deposit from you before you've gone to your room . For me if I purchase something I like to pay for it and in control of spending . Heading to the room it was very spacious and nice and clean . The setup of the TV is abit half and half of you want to view from your bed . It's more for the sofa provided . The shower bathroom was small but ok . Not as glitz and glamour as I would have expected - 

Access to and from the boat suprised me there was n open door alongside the main entrance where anyone cud just walk in . Heading towards the rooms . I presumed there would be guards . Security at the front - the area is nice I wanted a quiet area so was happy something abit out of the way and not big crowds or high street noisy being nearby  . Nice walk along the river some nice places to eat . Ended up going to the marina which is very close to the hotel - the view is really nice on the boat looking down to the 02 . But the space is very limited . I thought there would be more . 

My perception maybe was leaning towards a cruise liner not a yacht - breakfast was fine I enjoyed it . Came with the deal . Would I purchase it seperatly from the deal . Deffo no . £19 for a full English . Buffet consisted of drinks hot and cold and some other bits . 

The night sleep was very difficult I knew not having n open window option would be a problem . It was very hot and humid - no spare fan . We had to move the two single beds ( ment to be a double ) to the middle of the room where the air con above was situated and got thru the night . 

I wouldnt stay again . It was for novelty . Something different - the only nice wow factor for me was the reception chandeliers with the stairs going up in a circular form - other than that the exterior of the boat taking pictures . Nothing else was interesting . The dining for the night sky lounge was very plain and standard nothing really.making you feel special about staying on a expensive boat . 

My expectations were too high - I wanted it to suprise me I didn't do much research on purpose . The prices of food and drink are just abit too over the top for what it is but again that's expected and I knew this  . I think it's definitely a place where people will come for pictures and Instagram glitz and glamour or even just a nice break -  but leaving with a feeling of . Was that it .",3,2022,07,18
119,Somewhere different to stay in London,"Spacious room and comfortable bed. 
We ate in 1 night. Food was good but not exceptional. Unlike the view which was spectacular from the outside terrace.
The breakfast was a bit of a bun-fight. The staff could not keep the buffet stocked. We filled up ok and the full English was ok. I liked we could refill our tea and coffee pots ourselves. Overall we had a lovely 2 night stay.",4,2022,07,18
119,Something a little different,"This hotel is definitely different from the usual... even for London.
A converted yacht made into quite a luxurious, good quality hotel.
Really nice interior, good quality food and drinks etc, with friendly professional staff who know how to put guests at ease.
Not the cheapest, but I definitely think you get what you pay for.
Would LOVE to visit again if/when the opportunity presents itself.",5,2022,07,17
119,Lovely stay in a wonderful little area.,"This was my 50th birthday gift from my husband. We did two nights and had a great time. My room was lovely and had a little balcony. The food and drink is overpriced but it’s ok. I loved it here I’d love to come again one day. We had such a giggle. The staff are 100% attentive and want to help you. 
There is only one thing missing in the rooms that would have made it even better we’re phone charger ports next to your bed. 
I rarely take an apple charger plug just take lead. It’s just a little outdated and doing a few bits to bring it into this technological  age would be so much better but that’s a very minor detail.",5,2022,07,16
119,"Great ship and room, restaurant ordinary for money","Much more fun than equivalent hotel. Room glitzy, big and spotless with balcony - great for morning coffee. Nice bar. Restaurant expensive and not worth that money - better to find somewhere local. Location can be awkward but river line an easy way to get into central london or across the river to greenwich. Some noise as under flightpath. Staff very helpful. Overall, much better than a normal hotel, would definitely stay again. Make sure you get a room with balcony - on upper decks.",4,2022,07,07
119,Interesting stay but could be improved,"We chose this hotel for a novelty factor of being on a yacht and its proximity to O2 and a cable car. The cabins are large but quite basic, especially the bathroom where you also have to watch your toe on the step up to it! The views from the cabin and breakfast room are pretty cool and the breakfast itself was good. The service was average especially from the receptionist who had no clue about the surroundings so do not bother asking for advice how to get around.",4,2022,07,05
119,Great place,"Cool place, good located and better service. It was an employed, Raul who was so pleasured and very helpful. We enjoyed our time in London thanks to his advices. If you want to enjoy the city, don’t doubt about this place",5,2022,07,04
119,Not worth the money.,"Let's get something straight up front, this place is not cheap, and that's why I am giving it only 3 stars, let me explain.

The check in was very smooth and the woman on the reception was pleasant and helpful, an excellent start, it is a stunning hotel, you're on a boat in the docks and the lobby has a beautiful chandelier covering 3 floors with a staircase wrapping around the whole thing.

The Room...
When you first enter your room, it is stunning, plenty of room a balcony overlooking the dock and looks good, however you very quickly learn this is form over function, there are loads of electrical outlets in the room.... Mainly European? I would of brought adaptors, but it's in London! In fact we could only find 2 British outlets and neither we're by the bed or anywhere useful. The balcony door can not be shut from the outside, if you do you will be locked out, so in order to sit for anytime on the balcony with the door shut (Say to save the air con) you needed to make sure that the handle was up and prop it shut with the bin or something.

There were no details in the room, by that I mean in most hotels there is a book or leaflet explaining how to get room service, or the restaurant times, etc etc, nothing... We were not even sure if room service was a thing here.

The shower room was spacious,  however there was no extraction and it got very foggy during a shower, the shower is hot, but weak and nothing seemed to drain properly, have a wash in the sink and it took ages to drain.

I do have to say the beds are brilliant and slept very well, although the pillows took a lot to be desired.

The Restaurant...
The food quality is excellent and cooked beautifully, we had the taster menu with wine, excellent and our server was superb, however, was it worth the near Dorchester price? Not sure, they added service to the price which I never like as I like to give tips for good service not assume I will, then at the end of the meal I was told I had to pay for it in full and could not put it on my room as it was over 50? They had my credit card, never had this happen at a hotel before, it's a good job I didn't leave my wallet in the room safe.

Breakfast was a bit of a faff, again the quality was spot on and cooked perfectly, but you had to fill out a form before you got your meal, (Dread to think how much paper they go through.) on the second morning my partners breakfast was 15 minutes behind mine and on the 3rd morning we we're forgotten for so long we had to skip breakfast altogether. The maître d' at breakfast was rather curt with us.

The Bar...
The bar is a stunning place to sit and enjoy a drink, however, it did take over 20 minutes to get served, it wasn't until the bar manager spotted us that we got some service.

Overall, we had an ok weekend, it feels like you are paying through the nose to stay ""on a boat"" we've stayed at cheaper hotels and more expensive places that would blow this place out of the water, (no pun intended) .

Will not be returning.",3,2022,07,04
119,Excellent,"We stayed on the yacht after a concert. It was ideally situated about a 4 minute walk from Custom House station, which was perfect for us. Check in was straight forward. Room was lovely . Great view of the river. There was plenty of choice for breakfast. We also had afternoon tea which was delicious. The staff were polite  friendly and helpful. We thoroughly enjoyed our stay and wouldn't  hesitate in recommending it.",5,2022,07,03
119,"Beautiful, beautiful and beautiful again!","What to say about this beautiful Yacht? Lovely stay in a room with private balcony with views to the river, chocolates with a welcome card from the staff, nice cocktails in the bar where we were invited to join the deck on a lovely sunny day, amazing music, lovely atmosphere from people coming and leaving … bustling around … happy and busy faces from the staff & welcoming reception team with natural smiles…it’s been a lovely and beautiful stay to feel free after this pandemic, a real reward to join the Sunborn hotel. A big thank you to the organisation as we enjoyed our two nights stay. Maria & Robert.",5,2022,07,02
119,Ian p,"Staff are superb especially Giusi from reception who helped with some last minute birthday celebration organising without any problems.
Rooms are clean with great views if your dock side.
Food is great.
I also recommend to take a walk on the dock bridge for some views of the city 
Would definitely recommend",5,2022,07,02
119,Superb Sunborn Stay,The hotel was excellent and my room was well equipped and comfortable. The breakfast was served promptly with a reasonable choice and the restaurant is also good. It is ideal for events at the ExCel. I think the only thing you have to get used to is which desk you are actually on!,4,2022,06,29
119,Favourite hotel in London,"It’s our favourite hotel in London! We stayed here already 11 times but never left a review as we travel often for business and have no time, but this time we decided that we will leave some nice comments. As it was our 25th wedding anniversary and we’ve got a complimentary upgrade and very nice welcome from all the staff. Thank you Sunborn team foe making our stay extraordinary and special. We will be back. 
From Joe and Andrea.",5,2022,06,28
119,"A little gem, much better than staying in a hotel","Booked for 4 ladies for a 50th birthday. After reading some of the reviews we were a bit worried but really didn’t need to be. The reception staff were very helpful, told us all we needed to know. The room was large with plenty of storage and lovely soft towels and very clean. Our balcony overlooked the green so was able to people watch till late into the night.  Made full use of the bar and food in the restaurant was excellent, we sat on deck eating and watching the sun go down over London amazing. Waiting staff were every friendly. We also had breakfast on deck the following morning, again staff very attentive and food was delicious, we didn’t have to be out of the room until 11am so no rushing either. We all said we will definitely be back. Thank you to the staff for making our celebrations memorable.",4,2022,06,28
119,Theatre and overnight at Sunborn.,"We went to the west end to watch a musical and we decided to stay at Sunborn. The hotel itself is stunning. From the moment you step in you feel like you are on a luxury cruise. The staff are very professional and with great attitude. The room was clean and with a great view of the river. Breakfast was too notch with great choices. I had the salmon and scrambled eggs whilst my wife had a full English. Plenty of bread cereal and jams available as well. Now with the Elizabeth line taking from central London to Custom House in 15 mins, makes the Sunborn a great hotel when visiting London. ",5,2022,06,27
119,Very comfortable stay,"Very comfortable and very convenient stay if you are attending London Excel. Staff is very attentive, friendly and always ready to help especially Ilona and Paula. 
Definitely will be coming back next year",5,2022,06,26
119,Beautiful,"we arrived for a 2 night stay on the Sunborn  it looks very grand ,staff were very nice and seemed to care about you we were upgraded to a better room as it was my wifes birthday we had a lovely meal in the bar restaurant bar was lively, drinks are a bit more than local bars that are just around the corner but was worth it for the view from sunborn  ",5,2022,06,22
119,London Sunborn,"Had dinner on Wednesday 15th. The food was delicious and tasty. I would recommend the steak and cocktails.  Very good service in the restaurant. 

Reception staff were really nice, professional and friendly.",5,2022,06,21
119,Poor customer service!!,"I stayed here in March. The hotel is beautiful and we were really looking forward to our stay. When we arrived we were impressed with our room. However, there was something wrong with the heating in the room, it was getting warmer and warmer. The thermostat wasn’t working so I called reception to ask for someone to come and sort it. They sent a receptionist who fiddled with it and said it should be fine. By 11pm our room was reading 28 degrees, it was so hot!!! My daughter was being sick where she was so hot. I complained in the morning and the receptionist said the manager was off sick and gave me an email address for the manager! I emailed straight away and didn’t here a thing back, no reply whatsoever, I  emailed again and nothing. We are now in June and still no reply, Very poor service!!!  Won’t be staying again",2,2022,06,17
119,ABBA VOYAGE,"Great “Hotel” and very easy for the train network with Elizabeth Line & DLT just a few minutes walk away 👍🏼
Balcony with River View is a “must”!!
Food & Drink quite expensive but in lovely surroundings👍🏼
Not quite as Glitzy & Glam as it’s sister ship in Gibraltar but I would recommend and I would return !!",4,2022,06,14
119,Nice hotel,"Very pretty hotel, really nice experience and great views. The room was clean and the staff were friendly. Would love to stay again with the Mrs for another couple's short break. Would recommend to all couples",5,2022,06,13
119,Amazing location.,"Just lovely,we had a very busy itinerary so we didn’t really use the bar or eat.The room was lovely and spacious,shower was blinking brilliant……..the bed was sooooo comfortable, I have never slept better in any hotel in my life,it was bloody massive,yes I would recommend 👍",4,2022,06,11
119,Poor customer service,Omar on reception was very rude upon arrival and didn’t make us feel welcome at all. The room was OK but overall the treatment from the staff left a rather bad feeling so would be hesitant to stay at this place again. I hope other staff are more accommodative.,1,2022,06,10
119,Something special,"A flying visit to London made special with a stay on this luxury yacht. Spotlessly clean. Classic room had plenty of room. Bed very comfy. Fab shower. Ate in the bar before going out, food really nice. Everyone on board really friendly and accommodating. Gave us a free upgrade to a river view.",5,2022,06,09
119,Lovely stay,"Lovely room at spitting distance from the London ExCeL conference center. Very friendly personnel, of who I would like to mention Paula from reception.... It would be a good idea to have the bar open later than 22.00 PM, but they have a nice selection drinks. The Chenin Blanc is quite nice",4,2022,06,08
119,Lovely overnight stay for the O2,"We had tickets for the O2 and we thought we would  try the Sunborn Yacht  Hotel, for a change. 
Cost was good value, as some of the adjacent hotels were over £300 per night. On arrival we found our allotted room was having a touch up. We’re were given an upgraded room by the manager,  which was a very unexpected and kind gesture. The room was superb, clean well appointed and with a balcony overlooking the dock. The hotel is convenient for the O2 being a short walk to the Emirates cable car. (Use the dab and go, don’t wait to buy a ticket). It runs a little later as advertised after the concert, so we could get a ride back too at 11.25 pm. On returning to the hotel the restaurant staff kindly got us some fresh milk at 11.45 pm  for a bedtime coffee in our room. 

Breakfast (included) was freshly cooked, good quality, with no complaints. Overall the staff were great and very accommodating. I would recommend the Sunborn as it offers something a little different from the normal run of the mill chain, but mainly as it’s a great,  good value, convenient hotel.",5,2022,06,07
119,Mrs Mpocho,"I'm pleased with the hotel reservations desk staff,was charming and friendly. 
The room is big,comfy bed,all clean .
The river view was amazing inside our room no 2046.
The breakfast menu was OK and outside view was amazing tho was a little showers.
The security is very good .
I'm happy and enjoyed our stay during my husband birthday. 
Many thanks.",5,2022,06,05
119,Nice but not 4*,"The hotel is in a great location and has a nice relaxed vibe around the dock. The staff were friendly enough, however we tried to get a drink on the evening and it Took almost half and hour to get it, despite only a handful of people being in there. I would recommend sitting outside. I found the strip fairy lights in the bar a little uncomfortable. 

There’s nothing flash about it but the room was big and comfortable. We used Groupon to get the good price which was fair. I would still recommend it for the location and the novelty factor.",3,2022,06,05
119,Totally sad gutted,"Sad ,sad ? Over priced with no ATTENTION TO DETAIL, tried rooms , bathroom wow it was smelly via the drain system in the shower ? The pillows where out off the dark ages ,no pillow menu? Food in bar area lol over priced and , very Sub standard for a 4 star rating? Catering mozzarella? Not Buffalo? On a salad ,the bread was ment to be sourdough lol the crust was so hard you couldn't chew it ? At 230pm on Saturday the 21st May had 2 glasses of pink champagne? Buy 9pm they had not left ???? Wow ,there wasn't a wedding on board so where was the stock  ,spoken to duty manager, who spoke to must be the Bar manager, but looked more like a door supervisor? I over heard he wasn't opening a bottle for one glass ? Lol lol ,Tuesday morning around 1am fire alarm went off ? Got up and got dressed look for the evacuation plan normally on the back off the main entrance door nothing? Where do we go ? Can't use Lifts? All the stairs where roped off ? This is a over priced, with no leadership or direction, the girls on reception never once smiled over 3 days ?? 😀 gutted best thing for this place is to sink it ?? Do not waste your hard earned money on this floating sad hell hole ",1,2022,06,04
119,Disappointed,"This was a email I sent to Sunborn which they haven't even bothered to reply to .    Room number 3028. To whom it may concern.
We have just returned from two nights stay at the Sunborn 28th May 2022.
I booked this stay with you 18th February 2021 for my wife to celebrate our wedding adversary which I have to say was very disappointed in our stay for what I paid on top £740 for room £40 for upgrade bar bill £24.37 breakfast £78 total for our stay for two nights £882. 37 which would have been fine if it was not for the following disappointments 

Before our arrival I emailed the restaurant to informed them that my wife has celiac dieses & is gluten indolence which reply was that they made a note which I thought great .
Pre-dinner drinks I ordered a rum & coke for me & Bombay Safire gin & tonic for my wife when drinks arrived my wife was given an ordinary gin & tonic, I was  given a rum & TONIC so had to wait for the correct drinks",2,2022,06,03
119,Sunborn,"We enjoyed our stay here very much and would like to return in the future, however it is quite a way off a five star experience.
Car park was a good walk away , not ideal to carry heavy cases/ have any mobility issues.
Had quite a long queue for check in , again not what you’d expect in a five star hotel. 
The website advertised a spa , which was closed due to Covid ?? 
The room was lovely , very spacious overlooking the water . There was tea and coffee making facilities. The air conditioning was poor and we had to give up and sleep with the door open .
We had dinner in the hotel which was very nice . It was spoilt somewhat by someone vacuuming nearby at 8.30 pm which is not conducive to a romantic meal ! 
After dinner  we went to the bar which unfortunately was certainly not a five star experience . It was understaffed , drinks were extortionate and to top it all the bar closes at 10.30 ! On a Saturday night!!! Most hotels keep the bar open until the guests are ready to leave ! The hotel seriously need to address these issues .",4,2022,06,02
119,Stunning!,"Booked a riverside executive room including breakfast through Wowcher.
Parked 3 minutes walk away by booking a secure parking space via JustPark.
Our room ,with a balcony was very clean, coffee machine and tea facilities, king size bed like a cloud!
Breakfast was very filling, cooked choices plus cereals, pastries,yoghurt,fresh fruit,toast, fruit juices and tea and coffee, all excellent!
Close to the Emirates cable car ride to Greenwich, local train station is Custom House on the new Elizabeth Line.
Well recommended!",5,2022,06,02
119,Birthday treat,"Enjoyed our visit to the Sunborne.  The reception is very grand and the  staff were very nice on arrival.  The room was very spacious.  We had a marina view over towards the excel centre.  The view from the bar was great, you can see the Emirate cable cars and the 02.  Shame the weather wasn’t a bit warmer when we went because we would have loved to sit outside on the deck having a drink.  Drinks in the bar were very pricy, it was £18 for a cocktail.  In the evening it’s very bright and reflecting in the bar, a bit too much for me.",5,2022,06,01
119,Classy,"Stunning hotel, lovely decor, friendly staff, amazing stairwell and lovely room. Food was really tasty too. Only issue was the room was quite cold at night and the air con was a bit complicated. Would be better if the restaurant was cheaper too - I’ve never been somewhere seen £18 for a cocktail!",5,2022,06,01
119,Don't waste your money...,"Please note before you read this... I have complained to the hotel since our stay in April, waited a month for a reply to which they offered me another stay at a discounted rate, I replied saying you want more money from me after I'm unhappy? shouldn't you be offering me some money back? they have ignored me again so hence the review.

Where do I start! terrible experience from beginning to end..

No Parking so had to park in the Excel parking, £20 for 24 hours, fair enough but closer access to at least drop off your heavy bags would have been nice. 

Got to hotel, lifts not working! reception is on 3rd floor, after carrying our heavy cases up 3 flights of stairs, reception ask for a £40 deposit for any breakages in the room,  what? I'd already paid over £200 for one night without breakfast or dinner,  ok do that, then they tell me our room is on the ground floor,  great! back down 3 flights of stairs with our luggage.

Get in to the room and the decor looks like an old Mercedes dashboard! dated wood, old carpets, bathroom that looks like my nans from the 80's, absolutely tiny, extractor fan didn't work so had a sauna and shower at the same time, fantastic! had to leave a shoe by the door to leave it open so the steam had somewhere to go.

Now for dinner,  went to the restaurant on board, drinks came and were completely flat, had to ask for fresh ones, Steak was basic, not bad but defo not worth the money, my uncle Costa in Cyprus makes a better steak in his village hut using a calor gas bottle and grill.

After dinner went back to the room, the noise from upstairs was unbelievable! not footsteps or anything just like things being moved around and it felt like someone was hitting the floor with a sledgehammer, to top it off the fire alarms went off 4 times in one night, no fires just a fault. 

Next morning we went to breakfast without a booking and I said I would pay when we'd finished,  breakfast was absolutely dire, literally undercooked microwaved bacon with stringy fat, greasy eggs that if I was slimmer I could have swam in, £20 per person for a plate of grease and something that was completely tasteless. 

The worst part was while there was still food on our plate the staff came up to us and said how would you like to pay the bill? I said when we're done ill pay cash,  she walked away and came back with the bill immediately,  we were still eating,  nowhere near finished! I asked why she brought the bill when I hadn't asked for it? she apologised and asked if i wanted another coffee! I said no thanks, paid the bill and left it half eaten on the table.  disgusting service and food.

Very disappointed as this was a surprise for my girlfriends bday! bad times, definitely wouldn't recommend.",1,2022,06,01
119,Special Occasion Night Away,"We stayed on board to celebrate a birthday and a special anniversary. 

We weren’t disappointed with our experience.
Reception staff upon arrival with friendly and professional making us feel special. Our room was spotlessly clean and spacious. The huge bed was very comfortable. We booked a room with the river view and balcony. 

We were aware that City Airport was close by, so were not surprised to see planes taking off and landing in close proximity to the hotel. In fact, it was a thrill to watch.

Please be aware they start flying about 5.00am so you may be disturbed by the noise. It didn’t affect our experience though.

We ate dinner in the restaurant, pea soup and scallops for starters then ribeye steak and lobster tagliatelle, all of which were very tasty and served by Alex, who was attentive and professional.
We finished our evening off with a cocktail in the bar overlooking the lit up views of Canary Wharf. 

Breakfast was included in our package. 
Continental breakfast was self serve, cooked breakfast to order was served by the busy waiting staff efficiently. 

The clientele on board was a real mixed bag- couples, families with young and older children, mature couples, group of girls away for a fun night. 

It was an enjoyable night away for my husband and I. Using the Emirate’s Cable Car to reach the destination made it fun. £5 per person each way.

We visited The Gong Bar at The Shard in the afternoon, using the Uber boat to get us to London Bridge.",5,2022,05,30
119,Brilliant.,"Chose it for the location and the quirkiness of it all. Really roomy cabin, comfy bed. Staff were very helpful - both at reception and the bar. Food decent, drinks really nice. We are definitely going back.",5,2022,05,30
119,A yacht hotel with a sinking feeling,"The room was not particularly clean. There was dirt on the table, and broken tiles in the bathroom. A lingering unpleasant smell was present within room, with this seemingly emanating from the small bathroom. The brassware in the lifts looked dirty, unloved and unpolished, and overall I was just left with a sinking feeling (which is perhaps what should happen to the yacht).

Thank goodness that I didn’t book the restaurant for dinner if my experiences at breakfast were anything to go by! 

Breakfast was a disaster: overcooked scrambled eggs served with pasty looking salmon, with both suffering from bland, if any, taste and [for the eggs] a lumpy, rock-like texture. Fried eggs had a skin on the yolk where they had been left under a hot lamp for a long time and were dry. The chef, frankly, should be pretty ashamed either with the quality of the ingredients and/or the execution/delivery. 

The staff seemed willing to help when engaged, but equally there was a lack of observation. For example, bread for toast was not replenished, and orders not taken. Coffee was stewed. All this reflects a struggling or understaffed  restaurant.

This hotel is, I’m afraid, for the blue rinse brigade or a “wannabe” wearing a tracksuit and gold chains but it is not, in my view, a place for the discerning traveller. 

All said, the location is very handy for the Excel Centre. There is also now good access via the new Elizabeth Line, although there’s also ample (first come-first serve) parking available for a motorist prepared to accept driving through London. Driving in from the east is of course considerably easier.",2,2022,05,28
119,AMAZING ,Amazing hotel . Stayed here for my wife's 50th birthday.  Staff very polite. Room was spacious. Very clean.  Even had a balcony.  Everything was brilliant.  Brillant location in the royal docks. Will definitely be returning.  Highly recommend. ,5,2022,05,25

119,Finally got to stay 😃,"I stayed at the Sunborn just for the one night in May 22.  It’s a really great hotel and in a good location for anyone visiting the Excel. The service from at reception and at breakfast was very good.

I  had originally booked the Sunborn hotel  for a previous event at Excel and then the pandemic kicked in. After originally booking non- refundable rates, I have to say Stella - the reservations manager was fantastic and initially allowed a change in the dates and then ultimately provided a full refund. This was one of the reasons for retuning now that normality has resumed and I would love to stay again.",4,2022,05,20
119,Beautiful place to stay on the Thames,"The yatch was amazing inside and out. We upgraded to a balcony room which was very reasonably priced. We had a meal on the evening in the restaurant and were given a great table overlooking the river and staff were very friendly, helpful and attentive. Food was amazing, very good quality and good presentation. We went to the bar afterwards and staff were very friendly. Our room was very comfortable, clean and had everything we needed. We will definitely return. 

I do have four minor observations:
1. The yatch is very close to London City airport and planes were very noisy, late into the night and early morning.
2. Fire alarm went off at 6:30 am.
3. Breakfast was a bit disorganised. There were no bowls for cereal, no spoons in the cutlery napkin so had to ask for both. This led to a delay in getting cereal by that time our hot order had arrived, 
4. Alcoholic drinks were very, very expensive,",4,2022,05,19
119,Amazing Experience,"We were able to return to the Sunborn this year to stay while visiting Accountex at the Excel. We could not stay the last time as there was a 2 night minimum. Once again it was the most amazing experience. The rooms are so big with really beautiful wooden panelling. The staff are so helpful and friendly. The breakfast was cooked to order and plenty of continental choices. We can back from an after party at midnight and they brought us Pizza and biscuits to our room, which was very much appreciated. If you have never stayed here then I highly recommend you do.",5,2022,05,18
119,Birthday Celebration,"I had an amazing experience celebrating my birthday at Sunborn Yacht Hotel London. 
It was a great honour to plan my birthday with the event organiser (Joel) who was very helpful. I must say he was very patient with me especially when it came to replying to his emails as I hardly use my phone at work or have time to check personal emails. The service on the actual day was superb. I must emphasise that the staff were so understanding as my friends were late ie African time🤦🏿‍♂️! The food was lovely too and drinks included in the package were enough for my guests.
The views are amazing from the Sky Lounge and the interior is simply beautiful. The compliments of the venue were wonderful.
 I would definitely recommend staying at Sunborn and celebrating a special occasion.

I would definitely recommend this to anyone looking for an afternoon tea with a view. 
Hamoussa who also served us was a delight :)",5,2022,05,13
119,Afternoon Tea,Had an amazing time celebrating my friends birthday. Would recommend! Hamoussa gave amazing service. The afternoon tea had a great selection not only with the food but also with the tea choices and If you don’t like tea they also offer coffee.,5,2022,05,13
119,Birthday treat,"My daughter booked me and my best friend a night stay on the sunborn yacht for my birthday on the 29th April 2022 as I have been on there many times for afternoon tea , lunch and massages and facial (before Covid time ) but I hadn’t actually stayed there so I was very excited to experience this ,the yacht as always was super clean staff was lovely and friendly room was amazing and we had a balcony view of the river which was fabulous, we went out that evening to the Ivy for another birthday treat from my daughter we went back to the yacht about 10pm to sit in our fabulous room to have a chill before we went to bed about 11.30 the guests next door was quite loud with their talking but didn’t really take to much notice as we thought it would go quite soon how wrong was I by 12.45 the music went on very loud by 1.15am I had to go to reception to tell them how loud it was I was surprised they couldn’t hear it as it was Blaring down the corridor the receptionist got somebody to come and tell them to turn it down or off which they did about 15 minutes later by then I had a massive headache and couldn’t sleep my friend was dropping on and off with sleep by 3.30am next door put the music on again very loud for about 2 mins then turned it off again so unfortunately I was awake all night , we went for breakfast to give us some energy but was absolutely shattered when we went to check out I told the morning receptionist what happened and she asked if I would like to speak to the manager I said yes he came over to speak with us I told him what happened he said he knew about the complaint from the night staff but didn’t know the time as they hadn’t told him so I told him , he apologised to us and said to leave it with him he would see what he could do for us and would be in contact by the Tuesday as now 8 days later I still haven’t heard anything very disappointed as he was a lovely man his name is Raul I have rang the sunborn and it’s his day off so I will ring again as this was a birthday treat from my 19 year old daughter and I feel it was totally ruined .",3,2022,05,11
119,Great night away in London,"Booked this through Groupon and was upgraded without even asking, which is always a good start. Yacht is elegant and very clean and in good condition, staff are friendly, restaurant very good!
Highly recommend!",5,2022,05,11
119,Sunborn Yacht,"A night on the sunborn London was bought by my family for my 70th birthday 
The yacht beautiful but the breakfast was terrible wrong breakfast bought to me twice when I did get my breakfast it was cold cheap ingredients looking around most people were leaving the breakfast 
The hotel yes but the breakfast was not worth the money plenty of restaurants nearby for breakfast",3,2022,05,09
119,Ship Ahoy!,"Booked the Sunborn as we were attending an exhibition at the ExCel it is around 100 meters to the exhibition centre .

Apart from a faulty lift first impressions were very good , on arrival we were informed we had been upgraded to a superior room with a balcony .

The welcome was warm and friendly and the staff very helpful.

The room was large and more than adequate for a night’s stay and boasted some extra kit such as Lavazza coffee maker and fridge.

On returning from a meal out we decided to have a drink in the bar which was very relaxing and comfortable, the staff once again were welcoming and friendly.

We noticed that it was possible to take our drinks on the rear deck with imposing views of the O2 and the city of London .

Our # 1 impression of the Sunborn was how relaxing, peaceful and quiet it was .

Next morning check out was completed with no fuss and we organised our bags to be looked after whilst we visited the exhibition.

We would certainly recommend the Sunborn for anyone wanting novel accommodation with peace and quiet if you are staying at that end of London.",5,2022,05,08
119,Great accommodation next to the Excel,"Booked this for an overnight stay whilst visiting the Excel exhibition centre and loved every minute.
Arrived early and were able to leave our bags so we could come back and check in in the afternoon, the staff were super helpful and efficient.  When we returned check in was swift and the rooms were clean and tidy as you’d expect plus we had a balcony to sit out on, have a glass of wine and watch the world go by. Area has a variety of bars and restaurants and has the funky dockland vibe.
The hotel bar has a rear deck overlooking the dock and away to Canary Wharf which is quite magical, it’s position A for cocktails!
In all we spent 26 hours in London on our whirlwind trip but all agreed it felt as if we had had a long weekend away such was the buzz of staying on the yacht hotel…fab. Get it booked, you won’t regret it.",5,2022,05,07
119,Fun stay something a bit different,"This is a cool place that we decided to do for something a bit different. Staying on a luxury Yacht is very cool. Checkin was easy and staff helpful.

Room was big if a tad dated - but that adds to the Yacht look and feel.

Shower room was a good size but no extractor fan so it gets super steamy and doesn’t clear.

Air con was good. General facilities - good coffee machine, kettle, iron/ironing board were all on point.

The experience didn’t disappoint!",4,2022,05,04
119,An amazing Birthday surprise to my wife,Loved the stay with the balcony river view. I had chosen a birthday surprise package for my wife which was well organized by the hotel. Cake and decorations where amazing. The dinner at the restaurant was awesome. Breakfast was average. Definitely recommend.,5,2022,05,03
119,"Fabulous ""hotel""","The hotel was great, nice room and balcony overlooking Royal Victoria Dock. We had a three course dinner and breakfast included in our package. The food was absolutely lovely and the service couldn't have been better.  All of the staff were very attentive, you couldn't have wished for more!
Unfortunately for us, we only stayed for one night having taken over three hours to drive up from Gloucestershire so didn't have time to travel into central London. We didn't think much of the location unless you were going to the Excel exhibition centre which was literally on the doorstep, or should I say down the gangplank!
Thoroughly enjoyed our stay though.",5,2022,05,02
119,Good location,"Stayed here with work recently.

Lovely sized room with an amazing toilet/washroom. The staff were great along with the food in the morning.

Perfect location for the excel as literally a stones throw away. 

They charge a deposit for the room.",4,2022,05,02
119,Wonderful Yacht experience,"We stayed for the May bank holiday weekend and had a very pleasant stay.

Staff very attentive and accommodating to our needs for the whole duration.

The room was very spacious, a lot bigger than expected as we have been on a cruise before.
Nice view from the balcony over the river and Canary Wharf skyline, same from the bar and restaurant area.

Breakfast was really nice and big portions.

We had a very lovely stay: will recommend and hopefully return!",5,2022,05,02
119,Poor show,"We can to this for my friends birthday,check in was a nightmare and the only 1 lift was working and there was lots of queues.

Room was okay but was not clean and I found a long dark hair in the sink on arrival ( This was reported to the main desk)but i didn’t receive  a call back from the manager at all.

The drinks - I’m far from tight but X2 double Cracken and Diet Cokes were £35, plus you weren’t allowed to order from the bar they also charge you “Sur charge” on top and I didn’t get no change from nearly £40!

The bar staff were rude and everyone was complaining about how long it takes to get drinks, and then ripped off.

The dinner was nice, but we were seated at the top of the stairs and it didn’t really feel like we were in the restaurant.

It costs enough just for the stay, let alone getting ripped off with drinks, then have rude staff as well.

I’m still waiting for a reply from the manager… I’ll update this review when I hear back.

Overall save your money and go elsewhere!

Apologies that my grammar isn’t great, thanks for reading.",1,2022,05,01
119,They hit the mark with most things except the bar area.,"It started out great. The reception area was helpful, the room was lovely - we had a classic river view on 1st floor and the breakfast was fabulous - we had the full English (which included two of everything! Beans, fried eggs, sausages and bacon as well as beans and mushrooms). 

Now the only thing that let the place down was the lack of attention to patrons sitting inside the bar area waiting for staff to get drinks (as you’re not allowed to get served direct at the bar). There was two guys serving patrons on the deck outside and us people on the inside was being ignored. After waiting 25 mins (more fool us). We got up made a comment to the staff about the lack of service and we walked out, all she could say to us was “sorry about that”. Not even “I’m sorry, please do go back and take a seat and I will get someone directly to you”. They should have one person serving inside and one outside - that seemed fair if you haven’t got a lot of staff. So for that reason I only give them 3 stars. I did try to find the General Manager but they were not available. 

I would stay there again however, I’d bring my own drinks or just go and drink elsewhere…",3,2022,05,01
119,Sunborn - perfect stay on board a wonderful hotel!,"A fantastic stay on Sunborn! We went as we were going to see Blondie at the O2, so very conveniently placed. We travelled over to the O2 on the Skyline, which was a great trip!
Our stay was wonderful from start to finish. The staff were all great and attentive. Our biggest surprise was our cabin. We expected a poky, plain little room. What a surprise! It was huge and beautiful, with a large and very comfortable bed. The bathroom too was spacious (we’ve cruised with P&O in the Caribbean and spent 2 weeks with a bathroom half this size!). The shower was powerful and immediately hot. We had a view over the water, a settee and large open floor area… it really was fantastic! 
We sat out on the deck of the bar looking towards Canary Wharf for afternoon drinks in the sunshine and it was perfect. 
After an undisturbed night’s sleep, we were unfortunately woken at 7 by someone clomping around on their wooden floor. This was a nuisance, as we try to never disturb anyone else. However, that was our only issue during our stay. We’d had an email to say the lifts were both not working, but it was no issue at all as it’s not like we’d have 10 flights of stairs to go up! 
Breakfast… amazingly great! We have had some fantastic breakfasts in top hotels and shocking breakfasts too. This one was wonderful! Orders taken and brought to our table - the food couldn’t be faulted. Sausages and bacon cooked well and of high quality -  very welcome to someone who doesn’t like cheap rubbish food! Literally couldn’t fault it - and it was huge, with 2 eggs, 2 rashers of bacon, 2 sausages etc. 
All in all a superb stay - just not long enough, so we are planning on returning for 2 nights next time, when we haven’t got a gig to go to!",5,2022,04,30
119,"Quiet, comfortable, lovely room","We were warned in advance that lifts weren't working during the visit and were given the opportunity to rearrange our dates. It didn't bother us. We received a warm welcome from all the staff that we encountered and they were very helpful, even offering to carry our bags to the room. The room was lovely. So quiet, really comfortable bed and everything that you would need and expect for an overnight stay. Super breakfast was included in our deal, along with a glass of bubbly which was a nice surprise.",4,2022,04,25
119,Very nice and comfortable hotel.,"I stayed at the Sunborn because I was attending an event at the nearby Excel centre. The hotel is very handy fr the Excel but also for the DLR, O2 and getting into London. The room was very spacious and comfortable with a large bedroom, seating area with sofa and a nice sized bathroom. The staff were all very professional and polite. The bar and restaurant areas were very comfotable and the staff were very attentive. I would stay at the Sunborn again for sure.",5,2022,04,25
119,A good hotel especially when you visit a trade show at excel and want to invite business partners afterwards,"We have stayed at the Sunborn London during a trade show which was held at excel London.

We have stayed in a suite with a nice terrace/deck where we were able to host a little gathering with clients after the trade show. Walking distance from excel to the lobby is really short (2-3 minutes).

Breakfast service was quite good for a London 4* hotel.",4,2022,04,23
119,Perfect for Excel,Great if you are visiting Excel as just a stones throw away.  Yacht from the outside and the reception is very impressive. Staff at check in were excellent and attentive.  Room was very large and spacious and the seating area great if you were relaxing in the room after working.  Im not a great fan of the whole wood theme so for me I think probably time to modern it up and make it a bit more trendy.  I also found it odd not having a window that could be opened (one big pane of glass) and opening the door was not an option as it was too windy and would have banged all night. All in all I would stay here again if working in Excel.  Breakfast was superb lots of choice and the cooked breakfast was very good.,4,2022,04,22
119,SUNBORN HOTEL,We stayed at the Sunborn The experience was lovely the room was perfect. We dined in the lands end restraunt the staff couldn't do enough for us definitely recommend for a couples getaway loved it xx x,5,2022,04,22

Unfortunately, I cannot recommend Sunborn London Yacht Hotel. That is, unless you have a diminished olfactory function, are hyper-fit and muscular, don’t mind unbelievably poor customer service, and want to receive a laughable discount when voicing your concerns.

That’s the sort of experience you can count on, if you waste £245 (after discount £215) of your money on this Fawltyesque “themed” hotel. It’s certainly the experience, my wife and I, and all couples who stayed on the night of 19th April, 2022, had. Let me recount it in reverse chronological order:

1447hrs arrive after short walk from DLR Customs House station. Greeted by a vile stench emanating from a sewage tanker emptying Sunborn’s Yacht sewage storage tank. Any ship carrying over 15 persons or over a gross tonnage of 400 tonnes must have either an approved sewage treatment plant or an approved sewage comminuting (particle size reduction) and disinfecting system or a sewage holding tank. This is a legal requirement under the United Nations’ International Maritime Organisation (IMO) Prevention of Pollution by Sewage from Ships (MARPOL) Annex IV. 

If this vessel was a yacht or an ex-cruise ship, it would have had to comply with said MARPOL Annex IV. However, it’s has never sailed under its own “steam” since it was built without engines. This begs the question why does this floating hotel not connect to the sewers serving the ExCel and associated infrastructure? 

I actually have a very, very poor sense of smell and I always say if I can smell something it must be extremely vile and pungent. In fact, the Sunborn stench reminds me of my second ever business trip to Delhi when the client organisation had a “company house” for guests and senior execs, in the Defence Colony. There was a 30metre bridge over an open sewer which was so acrid and vile, I had to hold my breath whilst pinching my nostrils as I sprinted in 41degC heat over the bridge. This was my first impression of Sunborn Yacht Hotel London. 

1448hrs: One lift in-operational (as warned by an email received a few days prior). Instructions say press the intercom button to alert reception to send the lift. (This is the instruction for entry between 2300hrs-0400hrs). Pressed lift button: nothing. Pressed intercom button, camera comes on (lighting around lens) buzzer sound, effect: NOTHING.

1450hrs: Intercom pressed again. Response: ZERO.  Noted an A4 sheet stuck on one lift saying maintenance. The operative word here is “one”. The other had nothing on it. 

1452hrs: Another couple arrived. They pressed the intercom, and the lift call button: NOTHING!

1453/1454/1456hrs MULTIPLE INTERCOM PRESSES: ZERO RESPONSE.

1457hrs: Sewage disposal WORKER informs 3 waiting couples that NO lifts were working and we had to use the staircase and ascend to Reception on deck/floor 3. This requires me to manhandle my Briggs and Riley Rolling Wardrobe (relevant later) my B&R Laptop Bag, and my B&R Sling Bag down a narrow gangway, through a narrow door, whilst avoiding stepping on the rubberised sewage pipe, trying not to breathe and up approx 15-20 stairs (may be fewer). 

1458hrs: SHOCK!! FLABBERGASTED!! On reception there were THREE! YES, THREE MEMBERS OF STAFF DOING VIRTUALLY NOTHING. A lovely couple who were checking in (the male was a true gentleman, and offered to help me carry my luggage up the stairs) were seemingly less upset than me. It’s not in my nature to ever be rude or impolite to anyone, or interrupt, but given I am awaiting major cervical spine surgery and was in terrible pain, I was, unfortunately, regrettably, irritable and direct. 

I told the THREE staff “have you ever heard of the concept of answering an intercom? Why are BOTH lifts not working? Why were we all standing downstairs waiting for someone to respond to multiple intercom presses? Why do you expect guests to clamber over a sewage pipe and to carry their heavy luggage up a staircase?” What do you think the response was? It was a poor attempt at an apology watered down with “you should have received an email about the lifts.” “Yes, I did, and I was aware of ONE lift not working, but it didn’t mention BOTH LIFTS!” “We’ll put a note on the other lift!” How ridiculous, only putting one note on one lift. I think this was a deliberate untruth. It was cover that both were out of order, but if they’d emailed people wouldn’t come. 1547hrs an email arrived noting both lifts were out. Great, let people who have already checked in know.

One member of staff sheepishly disappeared, well why would you check in three couples using three staff, especially after they had a FAWLTYESQUE experience as a first impression? I have been fortunate to have stayed at some of the best hotels in the World, some in London, like The Savoy, The Waldorf Astoria, and The Villa d’Este. I have also stayed in the budget Travelodge type places and the AMAZING City Centre Hotel in Indra Naghar, Bangalore (£12 a night spotless, amazing food, budget furnished room, but still comfortable). These have been for pleasure but  mainly for business. (Including the Bangalore one (cheap skate crooked Institute of Clinical Research India ripped off our company and all the hotels (by never paying them) across India where I made 64 trips x 5 cities in 6 years.)

I have never ever in 30 years of executive employment been treated with such apathy and a mealy-mouthed apology, appalling customer service ever, at any hotel. I would use the figurative “to add insult to injury” (I had the exacerbation of my injury) so the staff member decided to give me the complete set with an insult! I used a Klarna Card (which is basically a charge card with no interest, membership or fees, unlike Premier Banking with NatWest or similar) to pay the £40 pseudo-deposit “for extras”. She kindly informed me that “it would help increase my credit score”. What she didn’t realise is, the Klarna Card with high credit limit, isn’t given out to those with poor credit scores. I read an article that the Klarna Card is pretty hard to get, and the average limit is a paltry £900. Mine exceeds that by several orders of magnitude. I like many high earners use Klarna to buy things because if you’re spending £1k or £2k a month on random stuff you can either effectively spend 3 times as much or cut your outs every month by a third. You see, if I’d been in a decent hotel, the staff would have noticed my £1k plus worth of Briggs and Riley Baseline luggage. Many frequent international travellers buy B&R luggage because they have a no quibble,  guaranteed for life warranty that covers even malicious damage. Perhaps  she might have looked at my shoes, my watch or my wife’s watch and kept that thought to herself. 

OK, time for some positives. The room was good, fitted with cabinet-maker quality furniture. The bathroom was less opulent, having a fake marble wash unit and an ok shower unit. The bed was a superking, not in the same league as my £26k Harrods purchased superking (when you sleep 3-4 hours a day you need a top quality bed) and was comfortable. The linen was of a decent quality. There were some marks on the cabinets, which is to be expected, however, the green carpet was marked and looked tired and dirty. There was also some form of snack under the desk, which obviously hadn’t been hoovered properly. There was a cheap, capsule Lavazza Coffee “machine” with 2 capsules, 2m packets of biscuits and 4 UHT semi-skimmed milk portions. 

Luxury is not an absolute concept, more of a relative one. It’s opinion based and therefore, subjective dependent on your life stage, level of, and place of education,  experience, expectations and perhaps socio-economic grouping. However, one thing that is universal, is to treat people with respect courtesy and consideration, no matter what one’s station in life. Thus, irrespective if I’d turned up with vulgar Luis Vuitton luggage,  or with blue, local convenience carrier bags, I expect to be treated properly. It’s called humanity and here’s a new concept, which is really innovative in the hotels and hospitality sector….it’s called CUSTOMER SERVICE.

The breakfast room staff were excellent, as was, Leonardo too, who was on the front desk at check-out. However, accompanying this review will be a letter, to the Finnish company that owns this shambolic hotel. I will make some recommendations, based on my experiences, and I will offer my services to help address these “issues”. 

Sometime ago, I was involved with an organisation, on a consultancy project, I was leading. The company focused on “people risk” and is very successful and the leader in this sector. People risk, for the uninitiated is: that risk which is derived directly from the actions or inaction of employees. Risk basically and essentially, boils down to financial losses. These losses can be reputationally derived, service quality derived etc etc, but they all boil down to loss of revenue, lower or reduced financial performance and reduced investor confidence. That last one, would concern me greatly, if I was an investor in Sunborn Group, a member of their C-Suite, or the manager of an investment fund. Funnily enough, my travels have had me cross paths with stockbroking, investment banking and high net worth individuals. Of course, these aren’t the likely clientele, but they are the likely people who might benefit from said clientele. 

When I spoke to Leonardo, on check-out he tried his best to appease me. He requested the £60 upgrade amount, which on booking in, I (incorrectly) believed had been waived, due to the poor state of the facility. We were ushered away from the front desk, which I took it to mean, “please don’t point out these obviously disgracefully poor situations, in front of other guests!” I duly complied and sat away from the desk. Leonardo came over after around 5-10minutes and explained (after me insisting on a waiver of the upgrade fee, earlier) that I had to pay the upgrade. He asked me what I was prepared to pay. I screwed up here, because I should have flipped it on him, and asked what did he want me to pay. However, having dropped my standards on trying to get £60 knocked off an agreed bill, I said I’ll give you 50%. 

Leonardo then told me, that despite them charging my card £40, that I couldn’t have £10 back, after deducting £30 I owed. You see, this £40 deposit is a con. For those of you who don’t know, large organisations often loan money out overnight. They then receive fees and interest on those overnight loans. Of course, a few thousand pounds from a crappy hotel in London isn’t going to be loaning anything out overnight. However, the holding company may well do. (Leonardo was very kind and took us down in the staff lift, which was working. (Why didn’t Macbeth’s mates suggest this the day before, although that would have involved answering the intercom).

The deposit is explained away as “for extras”. Since nothing is in the room, and every single hotel I have ever booked, keeps a record of your card, I have never been asked for this before. As forty quid is hardly anything these days (to we fortunate ones) Sunborn know, no-one will moan about it. It puts me in mind of a lad, I went to school with, whose dad was a construction magnate. This friend would go and ask everyone for a loan of 5p (1970s). The next day, no-one ever asked him for the 5p back. This was the days when the average UK salary was £40 per week as opposed to approx. £550 per week now. In other words, it’s a scam. 

My considered advice, and having advised the Indian Government and Her Majesty’s Government, I believe I am qualified to say this: “keep your hard earned money in your pocket. Do not waste it on this fake-luxury hotel. There’s a massive global financial collapse about to happen. Spend money where you will get good service, be treated with respect and feel like you are the special and unique person you are. £200 is about average in London. Either save up for a guaranteed better experience, or do a few trips in a budget hotel. Their customer service I will be far superior to this shambolic “luxury” hotel. In fact, the Royal Kensington Hotel, which is a hotel that often has some of the World’s top football teams stay, is only £250-£300 a night. It’s in a safer part of town, and knows how to treat guests properly

N.B. This is for any representative of the “shonky” (picked up during my stint in the City) outfit: Why would someone spend a sizeable chunk of his evening writing this, especially when he has a beautiful wife? It’s because I want to ensure, the stench I had to endure, with limited recompense, prevents those who want to treat their loved ones with a special surprise, from WASTING THEIR MONEY. I feel sorry that people may lose their jobs, but the cleaning staff, breakfast staff and Leonardo will get jobs, the others don’t deserve to work until they have learned the basics, i.e. good manners. 

Leaving around 1120hrs, the tanker, the smell and the effluent pipe were back again. Two days in a row. I’d be interested to know whether that pipe is there every day. The parrot stand with a pointer up to reception only appeared on 20th April. I have stayed in hotels where one or more lifts aren’t working. They get them sorted immediately, unlike Sunborn. 

By the way, along with my (and many others) prediction of global collapse (in the West) I really hope the poor Ukrainians are welcomed in our great country especially on 1st January every year. You might even join in on their torchlight processions.",2,2022,04,21
119,Amazing stay,The most amazing stay ever! Everyone was very friendly and helpful (especially Ilona) and went an extra mile to make our stay even more special for our big 50th birthdays and 30th wedding anniversary celebrations!,5,2022,04,19
119,Incredible experience and good hub exploring area,"What can I say- beautiful place, spotless and staff super helpful. Yes, drinks are crazy prices and there is a strange thin topper on bed with the crack down the middle but hey, we knew this from other reviews and did not take away from

119,Overnight stay,"Sunborn is wonderful. From on arrival, Atif displayed great professionalism...friendly and accommodating. The room and views were beautiful. Excellent service throughout.  Special mention of Hamza... Will certainly come again.",5,2022,04,18
119,"Amazing, would definitely recommend!",One of the best places we’ve ever stayed and we will definitely be back! The staff were so helpful from the minute we checked in and throughout our whole stay here. Rooms were big and to a very high standard with everything we needed. The bar in the evening and restaurant for breakfast were well organised and the food was delicious!,5,2022,04,17
119,Just like being on a cruise ship,"We spent a night here over the sunny Easter Bank Holiday. 
We arrived a little earlier than the 3pm check in time, so were not too surprised to be told the room wasn't ready. 
So we headed up to the bar for a couple of expensive drinks, but an amazing view over the dock and Canary Wharf. 
About 4pm we headed back to reception and were shocked to find the whole space full of people waiting to check in. After queueing for about 30 minutes we finally got our room key.
The room itself was large and tastefully furnished. With a balcony and views across to the Excel.
The bed was large and comfortable. 
We made it to breakfast early as advised to beat the rush, and were rewarded with a window table. I had a full English which was excellent and very quickly served. 
So apart from the long delay checking in, I would recommend the Sunborn as a great place to stay.",4,2022,04,16
119,Never again,"Stayed here on a Sunday night until the Monday. The hotel was fine itself. The room was clean and lovely. The cooked breakfast was the most bland food I’ve ever had and we are not fussy eaters. I had noticed most tables had left their cooked breakfast. I also paid £25 for and I quote “balloons and bannerS” I was embarrassed id paid £25 for what we got. My boyfriend didn’t even notice them. We had 3 helium balloons on the bedside table from card factory and the most pointless cardboard banner that we didn’t even notice! It was shocking. I also got told to pay £40 deposit on arrival which I wasn’t told when booking. The receptionist told me it would be put back in instantly the next day. It’s now Saturday and I’m still waiting. I phone on Tuesday and said they would call back and no one did. I can imagine to some that £40 would be needed. The top deck was also closed so we couldn’t even go up for the views. Which was annoying. Wouldn’t really recommend staying there: you’re just paying to tell people you stayed on a yacht. 
Photo attached of banner.",3,2022,04,16
119,A Memorable Yacht Experience!!!!!!,"We stayed here for one night. We found it very easy to get to from Kent parking at North Greenwich station and took the Emirates cable car from there to Royal Docks. 

The first impression was, as if we were on a cruise liner without actually being on a cruise. The reception were very helpful in getting the room earlier than the scheduled time at 3pm considering, we had an afternoon tea booked at the Lands End restaurant at 230 pm. The room was spacious with a double bed and a sofa bed for my two young daughters and me. We were very impressed with the cleanliness and the amenities that the room had to offer.

After freshening up, we went for our afternoon tea and to our surprise they had a wonderful selection of vegetarian sandwiches and treats which we  was truly thankful for. The food, service and the ambience were all excellent.

The following morning we had breakfast. The continental spread is displayed on  the buffet with the English breakfast cooked to order. Once again a good choice of healthy vegetarian options to match. 

It was important that my daughters and I created fond memories during and this certainly lived up to those expectations. 

Thank you to Francisco and his team at Sunborn Yacht Hotel for making it all happen. Look forward to many more future stays. 

I would recommend this place to anyone be it a couple or a family.",5,2022,04,15
119,Beware hidden bar charges ,"Dissapointed with bar , drinks unbelievably expensive, pint of perroni £8.50. Tried ordering at bar  which was extremely quiet, was told table service only. We ordered two drinks.  Upon paying bill was charged 12.5% discretionary service charge without being asked if I wanted to pay this . Discretionary means a choice that I wasn't given. 

Had to upgrade at reception due to air conditioning not working in our original room, we upgraded to a room with balcony at extra cost . 
Staff could benefit from extra training,  receptionist couldn't even tell us how old the ship was  ..

119,Wonderful Stay,"I booked this hotel as part of a suprise for my boyfriend's  birthday. The staff were highly accommodating, particularly in the restaurant. The food was lovely and Yanko (our waiter) was extremely attentive. 

I would have no hesitation in recommending this hotel!",5,2022,04,10
119,Great time Thank you.,"Good stay, big room with nice balcony to the river, amazing breakfast with multiple choice selections for everyone , very smooth check in process and  amazing reception team very helpful with all my request from them. Thank you,well done stay safe.",5,2022,04,09
119,Fantastic service,"Excellent service from start to finish. Rooms were comfortable and spacious. Breakfast was cooked to order and good selection of cold items to self serve. 
Location directly opposite the Excel Centre and Custom House DLR station.
Staff dealt with any issue quickly and professionally",5,2022,04,09
119,Very Disappointing Experience,"I genuinely cannot understand the glowing online reports of this hotel.  We stayed here because of the proximity of the hotel to Excel, where we were exhibiting at a trade show, and the good reviews on TripAdvisor.
On arrival, we were blanked by the reception staff, as if they had more important issue to attend to on their screens.  Once we were attended to there was little in the way of friendliness, or that we mattered as guests.
The room/cabin had no water or paperwork (I expect Covid is used as a reason) so didn't feel very welcoming.  The view from the room, across Royal Victoria Dock, was amazing and added a special touch to the room.
At breakfast the following morning there was a queue of about 20 people waiting, before the dining room was opened - later than the advised time.  The was a big glass breakage at the food counter whilst we ate breakfast and only the large pieces of glass were picked up but thousands of other pieces were left on the floor to be walked on/around by guests.  It felt like there were far too few staff to manage the place and it showed in their stress levels.
All-in-all a massively disappointing experience, with so much potential as a venue and proximity to Excel.  The other reviews are so effusive it feels like we're talking about a different place...  I have given it three stars out of sympathy for an industry trying to get back on its feet.",3,2022,04,07
119,First Class all round,"Wow! Wow! And Wow again! From the stunning decor and beautifully appointed rooms, to the attentive and personal service given by the staff, we were treated like royalty from the moment we stepped aboard. Their friendly, helpful and caring approach together with the most charming and calming of atmospheres meant we had the most pleasurable experience during our stay here. Thankyou Sunborn Yacht Hotel",5,2022,04,06
119,Lovely Evening,Went for dinner on 02/04/2022. Had an absolutely amazing time. The view is exceptional. The food was amazing and the white chocolate dessert is one of the best things I've ever eaten. However what made this visit perfect was the wonderful service from our waiter Yanko. He had a really jolly personality and he was so attentive. Truly 5* service. Hamoussa was also very pleasant having brought our drinks over to us. Definitely recommend going and we will be back for sure! Thank you Yanko and Hamoussa for a wonderful evening!,5,2022,04,03
119,Birthday weekend,"Arrived sat afternoon,welcomed on arrival, swiftly checked in.got to room to be greeted with an upgrade to a river view balcony.went for a couple of drinks in the bar,again superb service staff excellent, expensive but worth it in my opinion.we did not eat here so cannot comment,but the food looked good I would highly recommend Sunborn and yes we will be back.
Thanks to all the staff we had a very nice stay with you.",5,2022,04,03
119,Tony’s 74 th birthday,"We did the Wowcher deal £98 for a friends birthday 
Was it a bargain No not @ all. There was a hidden charge of £20 per person because it was a Friday not transparent on the Wowcher deal until the member of staff points it out in the small print but they don’t tell you when you make your booking! 
( it is there in small print) 
That aside it was full of problems 
But to be fair they did try & put it all right! 
One particular waiter really did try his best he was from Bulgaria  I have forgotten his name 
But as a waiter he had been called into the kitchen to help out when  we asked were he was to give him a tip in person 
A waiter called into the kitchen speaks volumes! 
We were shunted into the bar downstairs 2 gins & tonics £25 
Pull the £40 excess 
Plus our wine £45 
I would accept all that if the food was good 
Starter was really good 
We both had steak tartare 
My main came home to my dog I ordered the steak very very bad indeed very very over cooked for a rear steak the chips were absolutely shocking they tasted like they had just come out the freezer 
1 out of 5 for the main 
The desert was good! after I complained a 5 cheese board & I was offered  only 3 
Cheeses But they put it right & I finally did get what was on the menu 
The staff were really pleasant & did there best to correct all the mistakes that should not of happened when you work out you paying about £100 a head 
Would We ever eat there again unfortunately it a NO 
But would I go there again yes but only for drinks & coffee.",3,2022,04,02
119,Outstanding,The most impressive service and food. Can’t fault anything at this restaurant. The prices were very good too. I only regret not booking a room! The yacht is very beautiful and the staircase impressive. I do wish they had tablecloths which would have given it a finishing touch.,5,2022,03,31
119,Beautiful Yacht,"The Yacht was amazing the location was ok as we did have a round trip on the cable cars whilst we were waiting to check in as we put our bags in at the hotel. 
The check in was busy the staff were a bit stand off ish but ok we were given our room key and quick details about breakfast and bar times. We went to our room which was on the 3rd floor a housekeeping person was coming out of the room next to ours she put a dirty room service tray with pots on it on the floor outside and walked away. We entered our room which was beautiful with a balcony and all the facilities you needed we did ask for some more milk and tea bags at reception which she fetched for us . We went for a drink on the deck the young man seemed flustered and took our order I asked for a menu so we could look at what food was available later we waited for the menu then asked again he did bring it but he wasn’t very confident or attentive . 
The tray was still on the floor outside the room even though staff were there and they walked past it . 
We went for a walk up the docks there were no staff at the doors only one on reception she was very busy. 
We returned to find the tray still there it was around 6 pm we got changed and went for something to eat at the bar a lady greeted us and asked if we were eating we said yes she gave us a menu she was very friendly and attentive i asked her if i could have the burger with different bread as I was gluten free she said she would ask the chef she came back and said the burger had gluten in it I asked if she could do chicken instead she went off to enquire she came back and said she could do chicken with gluten free bread and a salad as the chips maybe cooked with gluten foods that was great her name was Lyina she asked if it was ok after it had been delivered to the table by her we thanked her she is a credit to your team . 
We went back to the room the tray was still on the floor at 7.30 pm we had a coffee then went out to take some pictures of the boat lit up at night it was stunning. We went back to the room it was around 8pm and the tray was finally removed.
The bed was very comfortable I slept ok until about 5 am as the room was very warm I put the air conditioning on it was noisy I woke my partner up so I turned it off. 
I was awake early so went to breakfast on the 4 th floor it wasn’t too busy we were given a piece of paper with a selection the waitress just said fill in what you want ?? I looked at it as it wasn’t clear to start with what they wanted you to choose in the end it was just the eggs scrambled or fried there was options for veg option and salmon and avocado on toast she did ask if we were ok I asked if they had any options for gluten free the head waitress was very helpful and offered me replacement items for the sausage and hash brown and gluten free bread so I was impressed with that and it was fast service and hot it would have been nice if a Greek yoghurt with some fresh fruit salad was on offer. 
We went back to the room and then asked for a taxi to be order for us it came promptly a £40 deposit was taken on arrival I haven’t had that before in hotel the receptionist made a point of mentioning that it was a Wowcher booking was there really any reason to point that out I know how I booked it as it was a present for my husband as it was his birthday . It was a stunning yacht shame all the staff weren’t as stunning it would have made our stay an extra luxury stay.",4,2022,03,29
119,Would return,"The whole feel of the hotel is luxury and is a great location for the O2 and the Excel. Good links to the tube. The lobby is stunning with lots of glass, chrome and brass. The lady that checked us in was having an off day. We all have them so no warm welcome which I think is crucial. 
The lack of parking facilities is a shame but we parked underneath the Excel. It’s £20 to enter but you can stay for up to 24hrs. If you need to stay for more than a day the very helpful excel car park staff can give you more days in advance. Dragging your cases through the Excel to the ship is a bit of a faff.

The room was big and spacious with a very comfy bed. The bathroom had the feel of a local swimming baths given the strange tiling, no luxury feeling to it and a very heavy door.
The views from the bar are wonderful but we found the service very slow. The drinks prices are astronomical. Others have written that the bar shuts at 10.30 – what madness is that?
The full English breakfast was perfect and the best I’ve ever had, really.

Top tip – ask before you book if there are any corporate events happening. The noise from the top deck was fantastic and filled the restaurant. We were about to cancel our dinner booking and eat out but it did get quieter.",4,2022,03,27
119,Let down Dietary intolerances afternoon  tea let,"The boat is quite nice! Beautiful view! The afternoon tea looks lovely if you don’t go for the gluten free and lactose free option! I went there for my sisters birthday and as a foodie myself I really disliked the food! Not to mention I was quite I’ll the following day. 
No thought put into dietary restricters, I would not go back there or recommend if you have food intolerances. Not even scones they served! Service was good! Staff was super friendly and they were very attentive to our requests. 
But the Gluten free and lactose free option is a BIG NO NO!",2,2022,03,27
119,Sweetest people ever! Fab hotel!,"Had the best time! Huge recommendation... Ask to stay on the river side!
With the biggest thanks to Leonardo,Atif and neringa and Paula, Christina.

We had such a wonderful stay. They treated us like family and couldn't have been kinder! 
One of the best hotels I've ever stayed in!! ",5,2022,03,26
119,How to get ripped off by the manager of Son born,"I went to this hotel in February and we had made a mistake on the booking the manager who was a very tall Egyptian man was very polite and told us for £200 he could find us a room and he would cancel the other booking he took the £200 told us we couldn’t have a receipt because it would’ve cost him his job because he wasn’t supposed to give us a room and didn’t cancel the booking and so now we have been charged for booking that we didn’t make because it was a mistake because we booked with the actual company and not through Booking.com they’ve now managed to get £200 for a room and then make us pay another 220 to stay when we can’t. now all this is incidental in the size of the world but any decent hotel could see it was a genuine mistake and they had a whole month to fill that room on one night, and I feel they should’ve done that, and told us as you’re already staying will cancel the other one with no problem ,, they didn’t do that because the manager put the £200 in his back pocket there was no record of us being there ,now I did take a video of the room and I have still got the key which was a card so if anybody would like to get back to me about this I’ll be very interested in what they’ve got to say I would never use them again that is not how you conduct a business",1,2022,03,24
119,Lovely stay but over priced,"Firstly, the boat is lovely, the room we had was an executive room, dockside with a balcony, check in took a while, we were told we had no breakfast included but we had booked breakfast, this was sorted out. The reception is quite stunning, our room was fine, large bed which was very comfortable. The evening meal was very very good, however there are only 3 choices of main, we all had rib eye at £36 each. The drinks prices are astronomical, happy to pay London prices but their cocktails are £18 each which we thought was ridiculous, the bar also closes at 10:30pm. We were on London on a Friday evening but we were all back in our rooms by 10:45 pm. In hindsight we should have left the boat to find a bar. There were only 6 adults, 1 round in the bar was £140, far too expensive. The waitress bought over 3 cocktails, then in error brought over 3 more, they were quickly taken away from us as we hadn't ordered them, rather than let us have then they tipped them away. So yes the boat is quite stunning, if you don't mind paying £18 for a cocktail and £80 for a main (one of the choices), and are happy to be back in bed by 10:45 then yes, I'd recommend the Sunborn. I will say the breakfast is worth having, it was lovely.",3,2022,03,21
119,Nice enough but not luxury in the slightest.,"We booked to stay here as we were going to the O2, great location for this and the excel, on arrival there was a queue for booking in which was about a 20 minute wait, we stayed in the executive suite which If this is the top suite on the boat I’d not like to stay in a room, very spacious and clean but very dated decor, the bathroom did have a sauna and jacuzzi which are nice touches but the place had the feel of a local swimming baths given the strange tiling, again no luxury feeling to it.

Room service non existent, ordered online and were given a number, after nothing in an hour we used the phone in the room to call room service but the line was dead.

Can’t comment on the bed or breakfast next day as after our event we decided to drive the 3 hours home rather than stay any longer.",3,2022,03,20
119,Weekend  Break,"Very disappointed  on the whole 😕  The lobby is stunning  with lots of glass ,chrome and brass,However this didn't  carry through  to the rooms .
We had an Executive  room with a balcony and River View.The balcony was very small and dirty with the paint peeling off ,The room itself although clean was very dated as was the very small shower room .
We had dinner in the restaurant  and the food was good but the prices even for London were ridiculous  😒. We  were made to feel uncomfortable  after our meal by the staff who obviously  wanted to set up for breakfast. The bar closed at 10.30 and again we were made too feel uncomfortable  as the staff were hovering  over us .
Breakfast was OK. The full English was nice but lukewarm  and the variety  on pastries ,fruit etc was very basic .
I wouldn't  recommend  this hotel as it's  past its sell by date I think  and there are so many better hotels in London  that offer much more  value for your money.",3,2022,03,15
119,Excellent customer service,"First time we have been to the Sunborn in london but we have been to the Sunborn in Gibraltar on 4 previous occasions 
The london one is a lot smaller and does not have some of the facilities of the one in Gibraltar but the customer service and room was excellent.
I would like to particularly mention atif on the front desk, very courteous and helpful who managed to make our stay special under some difficult circumstances.
Will definitely return 

Keith",5,2022,03,14
119,Perfect location for a visit to London ExCel,"I stayed with my daughter for an event at ExCel. She was very excited by the idea of staying on a boat and by the chandelier in reception!
The whole feel of the hotel is luxury, as is the service. All staff were extremely friendly and helpful, with a special shout-out to Leonardo, who was so genuinely concerned when my daughter cut her thumb.
The room was absolutely spotless, the bed very comfortable and the coffee machine produced excellent coffee.
Breakfast was good, if fairly limited in choice and it was served very quickly.
We had a welcome upgrade to a room with a balcony - a perfect stay.",5,2022,03,13
119,Sunborn is a real gem!,"It’s been a pleasure to come back to East London for business and I discovered this jewel in Victoria docks. 

The Sunborn has been a big surprise in many aspects. The location, the price , the room comfort, the personnel and the facilities itself.  

The restaurant has a variety of many dishes which allows me to come back and join other options in my next stay, also, it was a plus to seek counsel and navigate into the menu with a very professional and attentive staff. The views and the city-lights  from the restaurant are beautiful. 

Breakfast was superb! Good looking, fresh,  with quality and very affordable.  

Finally, as a professional staff trainer, it took my attention how Reception staff manage the pressure of having a big queue  with demanding request and how well organised they were. My check in experience process was peaceful and very smart, I would say, elegant! You can offer a great product but staff is key, it’s the asset.  I will come back once again as I felt very welcome, a taste of real hospitality.

The only negative point which I feel I have to mention here was the  lack of parking facilities. However, overall is great!  10 points of 10! 

Next stay, May 2022",5,2022,03,12
119,"Quality, Luxury, and Comfort, combined","Location is superb and in my opinion, well worth the money. I booked a suite for my wife and me on the basis of the hotel's own merits, and then looked at the mixed reviews. All I can think is that there are some very negative reviewers on here, or else my expectations are way lower than theirs! I paid a lot of money, but do not regret it for a moment.

The reception, I admit, was busy and very slow. I am used to checking in within five minutes. Here it was 15minutes, however, the staff were friendly, and apologetic for the delay, so no problem in the greater scheme of things.

Junior riverview suite was superb, spacious, and well appointed. Complimentary mini-bar was well stocked and a nice surprise. Everything was clean and in good working order/well presented. Storage space was exceptional. Some reviews suggest the hotel is ""dated"", but remember the theme is nautical, so the natural wood and high gloss finish was fine by me. Bed was comfortable and room temperature adjustable by air-con, door to balcony, or easy adjustable radiators. Bathroom was excellent and water soft, with instant warm or hot supply if required, and an over-bath shower.

Staff are a credit to the company. Discreet, friendly, knowledgeable and attentive to the smallest detail. I was impressed! Nothing is too much trouble. Food was beautiful. Evening menu was expensive but worth every penny. The dining room and bar have fantastic views.

I could go on, but suffice to say, I look forward to returning soon! Thank you Sunborn, London.",4,2022,03,12
119,Staff rude not clean,Staff was commenting on my sexuality very uncomfortable and extremely rude stay clear room dirty and food was cold the staff were giggling and I was very upset hotel manager would not help not professionally at all,1,2022,03,08
119,Trying to be something it’s not!,"They market this place as a fancy hotel when in reality it’s a bit basic. We had a river view room and while the room was spacious it was lacking in some things I think are basic when you are paying a bit more for a hotel. There was a coffee machine, great but only offer expressing pods nothing else. No bottled water in the room and while there are tea bags and creamer there was only small coffee cups, not tea cups. There was no bin bag in the bin so there were leftover stains etc in the bin from previous guests. The location offer room service but there is no menu in the room and no other guest information. The rooms get very hot so be prepared for that. The bar is very expensive! Cheapest small glass of wine was £9.50 and come in a real heavy chunky glass, not what I would expect for the price.  Check in was really slow, The brekkie was good. I would not stay here again.",3,2022,03,07
119,Belated 21st Birthday treat for my daughter.,"Sunborn Yacht Hotel. 

I bought a Wowcher deal and normally only use Groupon so the clarity is much better on Groupon to what you receive, I thought I had booked the room with a balcony due to me liking to have a cold room to sleep in, well I don’t know what happened but although it was a £179.00 discounted room it didn’t have a window or a balcony which was expected as that was the picture advertised. 
I am not one for complaining at the best of times, especially when getting a Wowcher deal and as I bought my fan with me thought it would be ok. 
We did actually go downstairs to ask about the rooms where the reception was discussing something similar with another couple who were told they were fully booked, so we just didn’t bother to complain.
It was like a bake house in the middle of the night, we could hardly breath, I went and had a shower to cool down as the air conditioning didn’t work, when we tried to change the temperature the thing went hotter rather than colder so we managed to get it down to 24 after about half an hour trying to get the temperature to drop and we opened our door to drop the heat, so I suggest that if anyone staying there best opt for an opening balcony door if you don’t like the heat as it was unbearable even with a fan which they don’t provide. 
Also the doors are heavy so you can hear a lot of banging of doors in the middle of the night, so if you are after a good night sleep, this is most definitely not the place to stay, we had a very busy day the day after and we were very tired and very irritable. 
Had tea and coffee making machine in the room as well as a kettle, 2 pods of coffee for the machine, ours leaked everywhere so be careful, the kettle worked as it should. 
They also supply 2 sachets of coffee, 4 sachets of sugar and 6 specialised twinning tea’s, there is a shop around the corner where we bought tea, coffee and sugar as my daughter only drinks normally tea and I drink more than two cups of coffee. 
It has a safe, Ironing board and Iron.  
Room was clean, bathroom sink wasn’t but everywhere else was spotless and you get a complimentary bath and shower soap set which didn’t smell too bad, you also get towels. 
Breakfast had a great selection and was extremely fast on the cooked breakfast, the sausages were amazing but as personal choice I would of preferred some of the breakfast to be grilled rather than it all fried as it was a little greasy for me, the was a huge selection of fruit and yoghurts which I dipped into, Levi had a very upset tummy over the breakfast.
The table was spotless and the staff were outstanding, they are a lovely friendly, welcoming, professional members of staff, however I found the window frames were really quite dirty, as the view is spectacular the frames could do with being cleaned. 
I also used the just park app and found a local parking space which I used. 

So although I done a 3 night stay at different priced hotels on my Daughter’s Birthday Tour and this was the most expensive hotel and the most beautiful one that I was most looking forward too, it’s the most I was disappointed with as I had such high expectations.",4,2022,03,07
119,Please don’t waste your money!!!!,"Paid £70 each for lunch - very poor service!!!! Waitress very rude - never offered us Prosecco which was included. Expensive coats on the backs of our chairs - no cloakroom - more like a transport cafe!!! No rolls, never asked if we would like drinks. Plates were taken away once you were finished despite others still eating!!! Food was ok but very bad manners and no etiquette whatsoever! Never offered tea and coffee which was included. Felt we were a complete nuisance and waiting staff made us feel very rushed and they did not want us to be there!! There were only 3 other tables occupied for lunch!!  what a complete waste of time, effort and a waste of hard earned money. This was a surprise lunch for my husbands 70th birthday! I’d rather had fish and chips at home!!!",1,2022,03,07
119,Lovely bedroom but restaurant let it down!,"We stayed at the Sunborn 5th March for one and booked to eat in the restaurant on the boat. The boat itself is stunning  and the room was big and spacious with a very comfy bed. The bathroom also had underfloor heating! 
The restaurant was however not so good unfortunately! My husband had the pork belly which was over cooked and very chewy. We arrived to the restaurant at 7pm and were finished by 7.45pm as they rushed the food out we had starter and main! Bill was over priced and the ambience was missing. The floor was also very dirty and needs cleaning. We thought by breakfast this would have been improved but was in fact worse so they clearly didn’t hoover and it was dusty! I would stay on the boat again just not go to the restaurant far to over priced for ok food nothing special",3,2022,03,06
119,Be careful,"We got a Groupon deal which sounded amazing but when we upgraded to a cabin with a balcony the price doubled even though we were told not to use the balcony due to high winds. Still, the room was decent with good fittings and had a fridge. Strangely though the only cups were small coffee cups about the size of a double espresso. Not much good for tea. 

The public areas were all mirrors and chandeliers. The bar was very pricey and closed at 10.30, not what you expect in a hotel of this standard. Only one choice of draught beer which was Peronni at £8.50 a pint.Staff were efficient but not that friendly. 

The restaurant was well staffed but the menu, as well as being expensive (£29 for pork belly) was very limited. The 3 of us had a potion of Humus for the table, which was good, 3 portions of belly pork with 2 side dishes, a bottle of water and a bottle of wine. No deserts. The bill was £181 including a ""discretionary"" tip of 12 1/2% which was also with the bar bill. The food was fairly good but it did not live up to the price. The restaurant was not at all crowded and I put that down to people eating elsewhere because, next morning, the breakfast area was very busy. 

The breakfast was £20 per head. I had the full English which was good and ample. Both my companions opted for the avocado on toast but when it came up it was covered with honey. When we complained the server very quickly said that the honey was in the description on the menu which it probably was. It was probably a common mistake and the server was obviously used to complaints about that dish. Why she didn't alert us to the honey I can't say. Why honey on avocados anyway? The rest of the breakfast was buffet and consisted of 4 different cereals which were of the Kelloggs variety it looked like and toast and croissants as far as I could see. Decaf coffee was not in evidence but was probably in sachets. The orange and apple juices were from a carton. I didn't see any fruit. Overall the breakfast was fairly limited and not decent value.

Overall I felt the hotel offered poor value and was only good in parts. Would not stay there again.",3,2022,03,03
119,"Not good - noisy, overcrowded and bar shut for private function","Never again!!!!!!!  I chose the yacht to host our senior management team meeting with 6 people and will never use it again.  Bar/lounge doesn't open until 3pm.  Then it was shut in the evening for a private function, so we had no where to sit or get a drink.  It was noisy and not a pleasant atmosphere.
Breakfast staff were just plain rude and I got asked my room number about 4 times.
Terrible experience - not recommended if you want a relaxing time.  It is no longer a luxury and pleasant place to stay.
The shining exception was Hannah who was brilliant!",1,2022,03,03
119,Amazing service,"Booked classic double room for boyfriends birthday as a surprise and added on additional £25 birthday balloons, arrived to check in and the hotel had upgraded us to the best room possible for my boyfriends birthday which was absolutely unreal. Staff had made the room lovely with banners card and balloons. The view from the balcony was beautiful. Breakfast was also included and the staff made special requirements to give us the best river view. Couldn't fault this hotel one bit, absolutely amazing experience and would stay here again. All staff fantastic.",5,2022,02,28
119,Absolutely Stunning,"We've just returned from a nights on the Sunborn Yacht. I was so concerned after reading some terrible reviews but I honestly can't see what people are complaining about. The boat was stunning as was the service of the staff.
The one and only downside we could find was the price or the food and drink and the fact that at 10:30pm your kicked out of the bar. The rest of the time everything was perfect.
The cabin was very spacious with a lovely hot shower. Tea and coffee facilities, T.V, plush carpets, full length mirrors, stunning views out over the river both from our room and on deck. 
I'd recommend eating at the local Italian 3 mins walk away.
Can't wait to return, will be getting a balcony room next time.",5,2022,02,27
119,Birthday Suprise,"This was a great suprise for my patner, the hotel was lovely and the staff were great. We really appreciate what Leonardo and Lenuta did for us during our stay there. They were absouletly perfect. I would highly recommend this hotel for a suprise. Our room was really nice with a few chocolates and a birthday card for her.",5,2022,02,19
119,anniversary stay,"Arrived early to leave bags as was advertised. We were wished a happy anniversary and offered coffee which came with croissants and pancakes. All were piping hot and delicious. Our room was clean and very spacious. The staff were friendly, efficient and helpful. Will recommend and hopefully return one day.",5,2022,02,17
119,Valentines weekend,"We had a great stay at the hotel, staff were friendly, rooms were clean, bathroom was not the best and on small side because it is a boat which we understand, highly recommend paying for romantic theme and the food was really good.",5,2022,02,13
119,Choose somewhere else,"Seriously outdated, the smell of damp on the room and the queues to actually check in left a lot to be desired. We had to wait 5 mins for a lift to get back into the boat that night as only one lift was working which we had to share with 10 other people and with COVID I really don’t think this was social distancing",3,2022,02,13
119,Fabulous valentines evening ❤,"I came here in summer for afternoon tea and it was really lovely. We decided to try and book a stay overnight at this lovely hotel this time.
We were not disappointed the staff were amazing and work really hard the whole time to help make your stay an excellent one I hope they are rewarded. 

The room was stunning with lovely balcony and river view which was stunning at night especially. Very spacious and clean with huge comfortable bed too.

Valentines meal was excellent the staff once again were fabulous and the food was superb.  There was a lady playing the harp who had a wonderful voice loved when she sang make you feel my 💘 one of my favourites. Roses and feathers plus petals on the tables was a lovely little touch 💕 

Thank you so much
Hope to come back again soon",5,2022,02,13
119,Overnight Stay/Restaurant/ Bar.,A Gimmick at best. The only good thing to say is that the views from the bar are amazing and I am sure in summer it would be a nice place to have a drink.The decor is dated and even the drinks  menus have the feel of the 1970’s. The restaurant is comical. The staff whilst chaotically sweet the food is atrocious. The mackerel starter is a cold slime swimming in a creamy slick.In fact creamy overload is a running theme. The mushroom risotto was overpowered by truffle Shaving and garlic it lacked any finesse and had the kitchen sink of flavour. Didn’t even bother with dessert. Don’t waste your money.,1,2022,02,12
119,Not hospitaly mind,I stayed here for my husband's birthday. I asked a small request in advance but they just ignored and keep trying to sell room upgrade. I think hospitality is not important for them. Room was OK but I was disappointed their service.,1,2022,02,12
119,Afternoon tea  not quite up to standards for the price.,"We visited the Sunborn for one of their afternoon tea deals, which included a cocktail.  We arrived at 1pm ordered our lunch and was advised that the bar wasn’t open until 2:30 and there was no bar staff to make the cocktails and they apologised if they’re not up to usual standard. 

The food arrived and was possibly one of the worst afternoon teas I have had. The sandwiches appeared fresh, but the beef was corned beef. The macarons were hard inside and out, and the scones felt like they had been rebaked. 

The yacht itself is now very dated on the inside and is indeed of a refresh. Not something I will be going back to any time soon unfortunately. This is very much an expensive afternoon tea for the quality of food and drink provided. Service was non existent once served, even though top ups for drinks were offered at the start.",2,2022,02,12
119,Beautiful,"Fantastic bedroom - HUGE for £120 - massive desk, bed, couch, really lovely bathroom. Really comfortable and glamorous. The location is great for excel and the restaurant was quite good. I can’t say reception was helpful though - never answer the phone, never reply to emails - got me a taxi which was super dodgy. That was the only negative",4,2022,02,12
119,"Dissapointed, could have been so much better","We went to celebrate our Anniversary. 
Had high hopes and felt disappointed from the beginning as soon as we boarded the ship!
We were greeted by a not so friendly receptionist who made us feel on edge as soon as we arrived. We were told our breakfast was not included in what I had booked  but thankfully we had the proof to show otherwise. I tried to engage with him but he clearly was having a bad day. Not what you want when you are excited to be staying.
I had a terrible job booking for the evening meal before we arrived despite them sending emails inviting us to do so. I finally got confirmation once we were in London!.
I was wishing now that we hadn't stayed on board for our celebration meal. There were waiters watching you constantly and they tried taking plates away while the other one of us were still eating. A real pet hate of ours. When we tried to explain they should wait they didn't understand!
The meal was expensive and I know its London prices but I didn't enjoy my food. My starter was cold and I was expecting it hot, my Husbands soup came with no bread. The wine list was extensive but very pricey. Our bottle of red was £42
Our cabin was very nicely decorated although felt very clinical. This may have been because of covid restricions ,not sure.  We  felt very rushed to get to dinner for 7pm as we didn't get there till 6pm due to tube closures. But having experienced our cold reception we'd only been onboard half an hour and had an email sent to us re check out in the morning!!! Felt they were wanting rid of us before we'd even opened our case!  We were hoping you could get out on deck and enjoy as a boat but limited areas to explore. I'm sure in the summer the bar spills outside into the sunshine. Didn't get the feeling we were on a ship/boat at all really.. had waited so long to go and stay but disappointed.  Hoping the reception we got wasn't because we booked with Secret Escapes . It was still £150 for the night.  Pertential is there for a really lovely place I'm sure but staff can make or break a stay. Wished I'd saved my money on this occasion.

119,Disappointing,"Poor location, nothing around spent a fortune in taxis!

Would be good if you were attending an event at the excel only.

Room was average, poor bathroom with a dodgy step that you could break your toe on, bed was comfy,
But no water provided in room which would normally be ok but they only open the bar at certain times which is no good if you need a drink in the night? 

Breakfast was nice, nothing special,
Check in easy and greeting pleasant!

We just felt that once you checked in you were in your own, wasn’t the kind of experience that I would expect so very disappointed & would nyt stay again.",2,2022,02,07
119,Disappointing!.,"Poor location for getting around London, spent a fortune on taxis. No atmosphere really.         Rooms were very average.
Couldn’t get a drink on arrival. Breakfast was good.
Not as glamorous as you would expect.
Great if you attending an event at the excel but apart from that not great location.",2,2022,02,07
119,Mrs evans,"We stayed last night!! What a disappointment, there was a huge queue, for check in! You can check in at 3 we got in our room at 4.30 as the queue was so bad we went to the bar and we had 2 pints and 2 glasses of wine at cost of £48, I couldn’t believe it, the glass was from Asda and the wine wasnt very good either!!   Room- all I can say very average!! Bathroom very poor!  We booked in the restaurant!! The meal was pretty good  and the service was really but quite expensive sorry to say we won’t be returning!!  There are better places to stay in london for the cost ☹️",3,2022,02,06
119,An Average venue,"We booked this Hotel for a birthday weekend. The location is out of the city, but that is what we wanted. The rooms are good but the coffee maker and kettle did not work. The rooms were of a high standard and very clean.

There were no instructions or information on the hotel available, so you had no idea where you can go on the boat, very poor.

The Bar was half empty on both nights we were there and I now know why , £38 for a cocktail and a vodka and lemonade. It was so expensive and they even added approx £5 service charge even though we were only 3m from the bar. Although you had to put £40 deposit on your room you could not add your drinks to your room
If they came to over £40, so 1 drink only. 

We never had dinner in the restaurant , but had breakfast which was fine. Limited hot choice, but standard hotel breakfast.

The reception service was poor, even before we arrived we had tried to contact the hotel but they never answer the phone. This was also the case when we rang from our room, no answer. When we arrived for 2 nights stay they had booked us in to a different room each night, so poorly managed.

Overall the venue suited our weekend getting around London so that’s why it’s a 3 star. No 5 star service that is for sure and very expensive to stay on board at night.",3,2022,02,06
119,"Great stay, loved it!","All three of us enjoyed our stay on the yacht, Raul greeted us in a  nice and friendly manner upon arrival and soon checked our luggage in, as we had arrived early.

We then went up a deck to take a few photos and have drinks in the bar where we was greeted by Tatiana, not the warments of welcomes but I think that she thought we had just wandered onto the boat and wasn't actually staying there, when we ordered drinks she told us there were no appletizers when later that day the other bar staff informed us they had them all along. NOT very good, but oh well.

Later that day upon check in Raul and an Italian lady (from the Almafi coast) checked us in, very
 friendly once again and we felt very welcome, they helped to make our stay very special. 

Later that evening we went to the bar to have bar snacks and cocktails, the buger sliders and cheeseboard were lovely, and I highly reccomend the Bahama Mama cocktail, the staff were lovely, Fortune was a nice friendly and efficient guy also.      

",5,2022,02,05
119,Complaint,"I purchased a night away at your yacht hotel for my husband for a Christmas present, we stayed on Thursday 13th January in a double room, the lady at reception informed us that they were fully booked and explained times for breakfast etc so we wouldn't have to be sent away as they were so busy.

Your photo's on your website made the hotel appear amazing including the bedrooms, to say we was disappointed of our room is an understatement, when i walked into the bathroom after returning from dinner you could smell a damp smell more prominent than first noticed when I used the bathroom upon our arrival, the bathroom wasn't sparkling like the photos portray, it was dull and looked like it hadn't been revamped in many many years, not what we expected at all, the damp smell was from the bathroom I am asthmatic so this smell made me slightly wheezy.  

There was no place for my makeup/curlers or any grooming items and no seat or place to sit and get myself ready which was very annoying i had to stand up in front of mirror. Even in budget hotels you get a place to sit and get ready. 

We had dinner in your Restuarant and again was very disappointed, the food I could have had better at my local gastro pub, i expected a high standard which we didn't get, i spent £155.00 on this and it was totally waste of my money we had two courses each i had 2 glasses of Malbec and my husband had two beers. We then had drinks in your bar again waited ages to be served and you weren't even busy.

In total I had spent nearly £500 on one night for complete disappointment and no high standard that we expected. I spoke to your receptionist who said there was no manager around to talk to me, and asked why I didn't just move rooms and I explained then I was told you was fully booked by look on her face I assume I was told incorrect information. Also, if I already been told that why would I come back in middle of night to move I don't want to move in middle of night I shouldn't have been put in a room that was damp. Your receptionist gave me your email address to contact and make a formal complaint. 

As of 2 weeks ago i have had no response to my email or phone calls totally unacceptable",1,2022,02,01
119,Great stay,"We had an amazing stay. 
The room was so clean and huge.
We had a great view.
I would like to say a huge thank you to every member of staff that crossed our path during our stay this weekend, specially to Leonardo at the reception and Tatiana at the breakfast restaurant.
Leonardo was the most attentive and patient person on our arrival, explained every single detail, directed us to the restaurants and attractions and at our check out he still remembered our names when we said goodbye.
Nothing was difficult for him and always had a big smile. 
Tatiana welcome us at breakfast with a lovely good morning, explained all the  breakfast service, made a note of our preferences and made sure that came to us.
She was constantly checking if the guests were happy and keeping the restaurant clean and tidy for the next arrival. She also was constantly smiling and made sure that we were happy in our table .
Thank you so much for an amazing stay and please say hello to both of them. Thank you. Juliana",5,2022,01,31
119,Unique Stay,"My husband surprised me with an overnight stay here for my birthday.

When we arrived the reception was a bit busy, although there was 3 receptionist they went as quick as they could (arrived round 2.30pm checked in by 3).

Our room was lovely, we have a river room, decoration on the bed as well as chocolate on arrival. Unfortunately we missed afternoon tea which we had to pre-book. Room was very spacious and clean, no complaints at all. Good selection of tea and coffee but no water in the coffee machine or fridge. 

Dinner was lovely, although more selections would have been nice. We ordered 2 nibbles (didn't like any of the starter choices, mains and dessert.)  Our water Gabriel was amazing throughout, bonus kept us entertained too! Drinks are over priced.

Breakfast was decent enough nothing special, again decent selections of teas, pastries etc.

Overall we really enjoyed our stay, lovely birthday treat!",4,2022,01,27
119,Ruined my wedding,Then manager Sami decided that he/she didn’t care and refused to respond to my complaint at all! Disgusting! Do me a favour and book elsewhere for me as I can’t afford another hotel stay. It was my one shot at feeling special and they stole it. Life ruined! Thanks Sami!,1,2022,01,26
119,Romantic Package,"My husband booked the Romanttic package as a birthday surpeise and it was more then expected. The cabin was large with a seating area and a balcany which for me was the icing on the cake, the bathroom could do with updating but the rest was nice. We had a 3 course meal included and it was pleasant but not amazing. The service was overall good but I wouldn't say it was a 5* and not  value for money. I saw a speacial deal on Secret escapes there and if we paid that amount I would say it was about right, so I would say only stay here if you manage to get a cheap deal.",4,2022,01,23
119,Welcome  aboard,A warm welcome as soon as we arrived. Staff made you feel welcome. Greeted by reception and booked in early with no fuss. Given keys to room and whilst we waited in the room they decorated a second room with banners and balloons for my wife's birthday.,5,2022,01,20
119,Certainly not 5*,"Very disappointing stay. I will say though that the rooms were clean although the carpet was wet underfoot from cleaning the carpet. Expect wet socks!
Very overpriced for quality of hotel and lack of facilities on board. Extremely expensive drinks. Charged £5.00 service for bringing 4 drinks approximately two feet from the bar? Bar serving last orders at 10.30.
Restaurant incredibly expensive and not particularly great quality. Most starters were fish and what weren't they ran out of. Service not great either with a whopping £28 service charge. Staff definitely not trained to a high standard.
Location not great for a London stay far too far out. Great for the excell or O2 but not for a city break.
Overall completely overpriced and underwhelming. Would we come back. Absolutely not.",2,2022,01,16
119,Lovely room but…,"Spent a Saturday night there - a birthday surprise from my husband. Our receptionist Sarah was very nice and we were made to feel very welcome. 
We didn’t book breakfast but had the option to add it on the Sunday morning but didn’t as I heard the other receptionist telling a guest ‘to get there early as there may not not be much left’ 🤔 Thus gave me some cause for concern as breakfast wasn’t cheap.
The room was lovely, clean and comfortable. 
Sadly, there wasn’t enough tea and milk and no water in the room. When we asked for more they didn’t have enough milk to give us 🤔
Also, last orders at the bar is 10:30pm for a close at 11:00pm, so no drinks if you’ve been out for the evening, which is a huge shame and puts a damp squib on the evening. 
The journey back into and out of the city isn’t 20mins - they haven’t included the walking time to the station or the waiting time for all the trains and there’s at least 2 to catch. 
Sadly, I won’t be returning. If you’re going to London, there’s hotels that are a lot more convenient.",4,2022,01,16
119,Excellent experience!,"We booked a romantic getaway which included D,B,B.. The bar staff made us the most amazing cocktails, yes they were pricey which you expect in London however they couldn’t have been any more helpful & friendly. The room was clean & spacious. The food was exceptional. The only thing I will say is the staff kept asking what package we had & I felt they should have known by looking at their booking screens so became confusing at times & had to keep explaining we’d booked a package with it all included.",5,2022,01,08
119,Disappointing new year treat,"We found staff to be unhelpful and rude especially on reception. Breakfast was ok but not good, fruits available two out of three mornings was apples only. Cabin with balcony facing river was lovely though.",3,2022,01,02
119,Worst customer service experience ever,To say this is supposed to be a premium hotel I am more than disappointed with the none existent level of any form of customer service and the person who we did manage to get hold of gave us the wrong information. Sent e mails which have not been responded too and given another e mail for reservations which just bounces back. So poor we cancelled our trip which was booked for my husbands birthday. Such a bitter taste I wouldn’t want to ever visit. I will be fighting for a full refund. I would not recommend this place to anyone.,1,2022,01,02
119,Three star hotel and Five star price.,"Nice 3* hotel but sold as a 5* . Stay in a executive room which was nice at first sight but the air conditioning was not working correctly so room was at a recorded temperature of 26c and the fridge was warm and empty. No mini bar at this 5* Hotel. 

Rooms were clean and tidy. Had Dinner at the Restaurant, food was tasty but Restaurant prices for Steak and chips again nice but not 5* menu.  Tried  to have a post dinner cocktail but lounge bar closed at 10.30pm😭. Which was more annoying as all other establishments in the area were also closed. Warm water from fridge was our tipple last night.

Breakfast was good but expensive.

Just comes back to the same point. It is not a luxury hotel. It’s a good middle of the road hotel which needs to learn there is a great profit by keeping your bar open later for guests, even in covid times.
Sorry Sunborn.",3,2021,12,31
119,Unforgettable!,"Took my wife here for her birthday and scored lots of brownie points! We are from a catering background so sympathetically critical, however, everything from arrival to departure was first class. The room was spacious, clean and not at all jaded through use, the bed very large and comfortable.  Breakfast was plentiful, and the dinner was very good although overpriced considering this is not fine dining. However the ambiance is luxurious and the service was as one would expect in a setting of this calibre. Definitely a memorable experience and may well return.",5,2021,12,30
119,Very disappointing ,Looked good on paper a unique experience I would describe the stay as very average. Very overpriced food and drink.  The woman who was running the breakfast service was so rude as we turned up at 10 having been misinformed by reception they were open untill 11.  And paying that sort of money I would expect at least a complimentary bottle of water?  Overall it could have been alot better!,3,2021,12,30
119,An OK stay,"I stayed in the classic room and was happy with the room. Bit of a shame that bottled water or complementary slippers weren’t included considering the hotel rating. As the hotel take a £40 deposit, you’re not sure what excuse they’d use to withdraw it, so was extra cautious in the room! 
Didn’t eat at the restaurant as the prices were extortionate!!",3,2021,12,29
119,Beware of unauthorised access to your bank account,"I reported accidental damage to a tv to reception on checking out. Not only was I made to feel like a criminal by the staff for the incident, they took money from my account (on two different occasions) without prior agreement or my permission. Beware of giving your bank account details which gives them unlimited access to your money and also of trying to do the right thing and informing them of any accidents.",1,2021,12,28
119,A beautiful way to spend our Christmas evening!,"What a great stay!! We were greeted by a lovely lady named Jo! She was very attentive and made us feel welcome the second we walked in! Easily say she made our stay and we only got to see her once over the two nights! Another gentleman who worked nights on Christmas Day (didn’t catch his name) was also very attentive and even “dimmed” the lights on the Chandelier so I could take the perfect photo!! Our room was perfect and better than we expected! We had a Executive room with a River view and this is the room I’d recommend! The bed was very comfortable, nice and big! The balcony over the river is a nice touch too! Breakfast was very filling and reasonably priced! Although I would of liked a few more options. 

The hotel is beautiful too look at inside and out. I would of expected a little more on the evening especially on Christmas night! A pianist would of set it off beautifully. Although this hotel still deserves 5* a little constructive criticism would be that staying in a room right outside the main entrance means you hear every one going in and out the floor due to the heavy door banging every time it opens!  

Thank you for a lovely stay and we will certainly be back in the future 🎄",5,2021,12,27
119,Don't bother writing to complain,So we had a real disappointment for our first honeymoon night. The boat was dirty and the service was dreadful. When you write in the head office direct the complaints to the rude manager behind reception so don't bother complaining,1,2021,12,17
119,Christmas treat on Sunborn,We booked the Classic river view room on Sunborn for our Christmas treat this year. The whole stay from start to finish was fantastic. Some reviews say the staff aren’t friendly but we found them to be quite the opposite and were all absolutely brilliant. The food was amazing (although more chips with our Cote de Boeuf wouldn’t of gone a miss 😉)  and breakfast was a really nice choice of beautifully cooked options. We will definitely be back next year.,5,2021,12,15
119,Looking forward but Disappointed,"Generally it is a three star hotel masquerading as a five star. 
Rooms basic, lots of wood and mirrors, very clean😁 no water, fridge turned off, no point in having a balcony, to small no chairs, over looking a dock yard. 
Main bar very expensive for drinks, small beer £6.00 closes at 22.30 when you get back from being out for the night. 
Bathroom hot hot, bedroom cold!
Overall ok for price when 50% off but poor value at full price. 
Badly situated, away from anywhere and need to use taxis. 
Can not even drop bags at front door, have to walk 100 yards from nearest road. 
Would not return. Read reviews they say a lot.",3,2021,12,14
119,Anti Climax!,"We booked this hotel for my partners 30th Birthday. At first we thought 'amazing' how cool is it to stay on a yacht so close to London, the pictures looked great and travel access was really good to travel around. However, the rooms were very old and very basic for what we expected, simple things such as a bottles of water in the room weren't accounted for, compared to other places we have stayed at a lower cost you get much more value for your money.
I contacted the hotel on a few occasions via email and telephone to see what services they could offer in order to make the stay all the more special with it being my partner's 30th Birthday...I received no responses on email and got told I would get a call back which never happened.
I felt very underwhelmed by the hotel and this place just became just a place to sleep rather than a place to enjoy for what it is, not to mention the noise was loud with people running up and down the corridors in the early hours.

Personally I wouldn't stay here again as I feel you could get much more for your money elsewhere and a much higher standard of customer service. We were not even asked how are stay was when checking out, simple things like this make you feel like a number and not special.",3,2021,12,13
119,Not as expected,"The room was nice and clean and breakfast cracking, alas thats where I stop my positives, I felt the staff were not very friendly, bar prices were quite high . In the vicintity not many places to eat or drink( we did go into the Fox )which was spot on and just a short walk from the Sunborn.
We ate at China Place one night which  to be honest is the worst chinese restaraunt I have ever been in so go there at your peril, poor food and kids serving you. I would advise getting the Air Line over the Thames to the O2 for a bit more going on , however not for the faint hearted going over the Thames.
All in all we usually stay at the travel lodge which to be honest up at Tower bridge is spot on and no different really, apart from the Standard of room.",3,2021,12,07
119,Mini break,Stayed here for one night... Yes the food is expensive but we knew that before we arrived & to be fair it was very tasty. Staff attentive and it was spotless throughout. Our room was lovely and the bed was huge. I can't think of any negatives about this place I absolutely loved it. We stayed at the savoy the night after I can honestly say I can't tell which was my favourite of these two hotels,5,2021,12,04
119,Amazing rooms / expensive food & drinks,"Upon arriving the lift is a little complicated & hard to hear the receptionist in order to actually get onboard. Check in from 3pm so we sat in the restaurant we had 2 G&T’s, 2 pints of Peroni and 1 portion of squid off the ‘bar snacks’ menu. In total it came to £60 odd so we would NEVER get drinks or eat on board again. However once we got into our room the views were incredible and the rooms were immaculate, big & absolutely lovely and worth the money.

Location is great to get the O2, we caught the cable car a cross (took 10mins) and got an Uber back later *note that the Uber / taxi won’t be able to get you directly to the hotel door.

The only reason I didn’t give a 5* was due to the cost of the food & drinks and the fact the cleaner opened our bedroom door at around 9am and woke us up after we’d had a late night at the O2 so wasn’t overly impressed with that given that check out isn’t until 11am.",4,2021,12,03
119,Perfect present,Loved it here so different lovely accommodation friendly staff. Slept really well food was great. I feel like I’ve been on a proper break before Christmas. The chamber maids work so hard nothing to much trouble. Good value for money be back in summer thanks everyone loved it xxxx,5,2021,12,01
119,Lovely rooms pricey food and drinks.,The rooms/cabins are great ..big and comfortable and reasonably priced (at least when we were there) but prepare to take out a mortgage if you want to eat or drink onboard. (I suppose there must be a lot of guests on expenses who don't quibble at those prices)   As it was we went ashore to eat. Had the food been more reasonably priced we would have stayed on board.,4,2021,11,24
119,Disability Discrimination - Avoid,"If your disabled think twice before staying here. To be frank no compassion it’s not a disabled friendly hotel. Taxis couldn’t access the the hotel barrier it was a nightmare! Broke intercom on the ground so our taxis was couldn’t gain access to pick us up. No thought nor planning for disabled customer. Very disappointed with this treatment , also noticed no children around either very odd!  I had to ask for a wheelchair in the end! It wasn’t offered the girl in reception didn’t care! Awful.",1,2021,11,24
119,FANTASTIC stay at the sunborne hotel,"i must say myself and my wife had a fantastic stay at the sunborne hotel. straight from the arrival to leaving it was excellent. We had a problem with the room once we got back from a concert just after 11.30pm but it was sorted, we were upgraded  to another room without any fuss!
i am disabled, althoigh i could not get my mobility scooter into our room i was able to leave it just outside the room and charge it! the corridors were very spacious! 
breakfast was excellent, the staff were fantastic, my wife was able to have gluten free bread and soya milk!
Drinks are expensive but i guess you pay London prices.
Overall an excellent stay!",5,2021,11,23
119,Disgusting,"Rude , and be prepared to lose your deposit. Literally no one receives their deposit back it’s a huge scam. We left the room spotless just the same as how we entered it and still deposit was taken. Also rude staff at the dining area",1,2021,11,22
119,Birthday Stay,"We stayed here for my mums 50th and the stay was brilliant! The staff were all polite, helpful and really nice! 
The rooms were great, bed was comfortable and can’t go wrong with the heated bathroom floor. 
Really recommend this for a little bit of luxury living.",5,2021,11,21
119,"Don't bother... thoroughly disappointed, this is a commercially sinking ship.","Really disappointed. Terrible bar service, ridiculous prices, last orders at 10:30 and apparently nobody to escalate too.  Wish I'd just booked the IBIS across the street to be honest. This is not 5 star experience by any stretch of the imagination...go elsewhere.",1,2021,11,20
119,Birthday celebration,"We stayed a night at the Sunbourn and booked dinner as a group ,  the hotel lacked customer service . The birthday lady was not recognised in any form even though the hotel were aware of the reason we came from various places in U.K. 
dinner was way too over priced for what you get . The food menu had no healthy choices . 
During breakfast there was confusion of if it was included or not the manner the hotel dealt about was so insensitive , right in front of everyone listening and not privacy and very disrespectful. 
The hotel lack customers service , it’s very overrated by me . I feel they need to be more polite and helpful . No concierge service .  
I complained to the duty manager Monday morning but she didn’t seem interested. I feel we didn’t get our monies worth",2,2021,11,16
119,A CHEEKY NIGHT AWAY,"First time staying and was so looking forward to it.   Sadly we were somewhat disappointed.  Post arrival drinks which is a must when we arrive, was like taking out a mortgage.  Whilst we appreciate London has slightly inflated prices these were off the richter scale.  £18 for a very average margarita and the second one was a completely different taste.  When sending it back I was told in no uncertain terms it was the same but if I insisted he should change it, which he did.  Then admitted later that he may have muddled his ingredients.   
We decided to stay on the boat for dinner to sample the overall experience of yatch life.  Disappointing to say the least.  Limited menu, grossly overpriced and very very average.  
The room was an Executive Suite which at the time of booking we were led to believe it would be river side view but day before arrival found out this was not the case and a £20 upgrade for a river view was necessary.   The room was very hot and stuffy and had to sleep with the cabin door open onto the balcony alnight. 
Surely breakfast would be better??
Sadly no,  The breakfast was included in our booking which was just as well because at £19.50 for a full English Breakfast was a real shocker.  To add insult to injury it was cold, bland and incredibly uninteresting.  
A very disappointing experience and one which we shall not be repeating.",2,2021,11,16
119,A very overpriced and  average experience ,"Having stayed here before and had a great time, expectations were high. However I was rather disappointed with the whole experience. Water View cabin with balcony well-wortn the upgrade cost. However room did seem a little 'tired' .
It wasn't exactly the best of welcomes at reception and no offer to take luggage to room. London City Airport is very close and the aircraft nose does start quite early.
The food offering is not particularly attractive and dining room struggles to cope with demand at peak breakfast time. Food and drink are ' captive' pricing and too high for what you get. Other guests were also rather annoying on this visit- loud and drunken behaviour. So, an average rating overall for this visit. ",3,2021,11,16
119,"Huge disappointment, incompetent staff, attempting to charge for thing that should not have been ... you mane is","It meant to be a long awaited trip to London to celebrate our second wedding anniversary, twice postponed due to COVID. Left us hugely disappointed and never wanting to come back again.

We arrived to the hotel around 23 pm after attending a show. To find the reception full of drunk people and the receptionists not paying any attention to the guests. 

A member of staff gave us two card keys not even bothering to program them  so they did not work and we had to go back to the reception which was a hassle as one lift did not work. Plus the pleasure of being in a close proximity to the drunks leaving the party and who, naturally did   not have the cards to make lift moving.

The member of staff also tried to make us pay for our breakfast despite the room was with the breakfast included, had to spend some time arguing and to show him our bookings.

The room was spacious but was all served for one person, which did not make us feel welcome. There was another set of towels in a cupboard but the first impression was : we were not wanted there.

Breakfast was disgusting (especially for the price of £20 pp. they wanted to charge us : a long wait for a waiter or manager to collect our order, tasteless cardboard-like bacon, mushrooms looked and tasted like they were leftover from the day before and re cooked again.

During  the check out I pointed all the above to a girl at the reception, she apologize and took my contact details but I never heard from them. Which does not surprise me as the hotel never comment of the reviews here. Such a disappointment, will not recommend it to anyone,",1,2021,11,15
119,Poor,"Poor service and very rude staff, very dissatisfied, paid £350 and upgraded to the birthday package which was ridiculous £45 for 3 balloons and a tiny cake, rip off merchants won’t be returning.
Breakfast was good.",2,2021,11,13
119,40th surprise trip in the Executive Jacuzzi Suite River View,"I would highly recommend booking the Executive Jacuzzi Suite River View, it definitely had the wow factor with a huge deck. It made our trip and the room was huge and very clean. We had no reason to leave the room!! We had a huge bathroom with jacuzzi bath and sauna as well as two open showers. I would definitely book this again. It was worth it. The only downside is that it faces the airport and there’s little privacy on deck. 

The restaurant had very little desirability but the food was good, just overpriced for what it was! There’s little choice too.  The cocktails were also extremely overpriced as quite a few reviews mention. I guess that’s to be expected in london! If I was to stay again I would eat out elsewhere but be prepared to travel as there’s not much around the boat. Gabriel in the restaurant was very attentive.
 The only thing you can’t do is leave dinner on a tab to your room so make sure you’re armed with payment! 

The staff were friendly on arrival and throughout and we were able to check out at midday at no extra cost.  

I felt the service lacked. For a really amazing experience (hence the 4 review not 5) I would have expected our cases to have been taken to the room on arrival (our room wasn’t ready when we arrived which was fine as we were early) instead they were left in a cupboard and we had to take them up to our room. We weren’t taken to the room or shown around it either and there were missing items we had to call down to get. (Again nothing major but something I picked up on) 

The bottle opener was in the toilet on the wall, we were looking for one for ages lol! 
The minibar wasn’t well stocked either and we expected it to be considering it was the top suite. 

The breakfast area is small so be prepared to wait at peak times. We ended up getting room service as we wanted to make use of the suite having eaten in the same area the night before. 

The views at night from this boat are amazing. It truly is a unique experience. 

I’d recommend getting the emirates skyline, but be prepared to wait at peak times as it gets busy! 

Overall for a unique experience I’d recommend sunborn. Ideal for couples and groups of friends for a special occasion but not for young families.",4,2021,11,10
119,"incompetent staff, charging for things that shouldn't have been, stayed for daughters birthday treat","first all the3 rooms we booked were not ready until 3.30 and we had a huge hassle to have the sofa bed for my son (don't go if you have any kids) the bar lost our drink bill twice and we didn't receive the drinks until 2 hours later and they charged us twice , check out was a hassle, the restaurant was nice but steak very fatty as only option was rib eye and the bill for 6 came to £550 2 courses and I've eaten better before. the whole stay was stressful apart from when we were in our rooms",1,2021,11,10
119,Great place for deep pockets.,"This place has a great atmosphere, great views and is a great bar to finish off an evening. But the prices are ridiculously high for the area. Be prepared to pay £20 each for a cocktail plus service charge.

I do value the quiet and easy atmosphere, but even so, £20 is just way too much for Zone 3. If it was in the Thames in Zone 1 I would understand.",3,2021,11,01
119,WOW factor!,"Our stay on The Sunborn ‘floating’ yacht  Hotel was a surprise gift from my husband as part of my 60th Birthday celebrations.  We absolutely  loved it! The views, even on a slightly cloudy day were second to none. We were made to feel so welcome by all staff especially Josh, the waiter in the Bar who loved recommending his speciality of cocktails 🍸and nothing was too much trouble. The breakfast was fabulous offering a wide choice to suit all and plentiful. The dinner menu was a little expensive but expected being on a luxurious Yacht. Rooms were of high standard and very clean. A big thank you for making my birthday that extra bit special.",5,2021,10,31
119,Breathtaking,"What a beautiful place to stay and eat.  The views of Canary Wharf from the cabin, the bar and the restaurant are just breathtaking.  The food served in the restaurant was high quality,  good portioned and served  by really personable staff.  The cabins are really comfortable,  well equipped and ver spacious. We will definitely be staying and eating there again.",4,2021,10,31
119,Not sure what some people expect,"Just got back from a night away on The Sunborn Yacht Hotel with my girlfriend and can honestly not understand some of the comments on here.
We got a deal through Secret Escapes for an executive room.. We arrived two hours early but were told our room was ready for us by the receptionist who was charming and professional throughout the process.
We got to our room and found that it was clean tidy and spacious with good facilities.
The only slight complaint about the room would be the dressing gown looked and felt like sandpaper where it had been washed and used so many times... (First World problems and all that) 🙄😉😂 
We stopped for a drink before heading out at the bar.. Again the staff were great... Maybe £8 a pint is a bit steep but acceptable due to the surroundings. 
A great night's sleep was followed by a first class breakfast.. Cooked to order and plentiful 
Overall the stay was superb.. Made all the better by the staff who deserve all the credit... Some of the people complaining about the staff really must either be stupid or have their heads so far up their own arses that they unable to appreciate what living in the real world is like... 🤔",4,2021,10,28
119,"Not valued, look elsewhere!","Booked three rooms as we celebrated our daughters 21st Birthday. For such a special occasion for us we wanted to feel valued and this was NOT the case. 
Rooms are basic although bed very comfortable. Not even bottles of water provided. When I asked reception if we may have some water in the rooms she pointed me to the bar to purchase some. Rooms are stuffy and warm as air con old. Three times during booking and arrival I mentioned our daughters birthday and not even a note to acknowledge this. Glossy machine on outside and worn out, treadmill on inside. Handy for Excel and O2 but there would be better choices. Won’t be returning.",3,2021,10,28
119,Special Afternoon Tea,"It was our wedding anniversary and we were treated like honored guests. The staff were attentive, polite, helpful and smart and made us very welcome. Cocktails on arrival followed by a large selection of teas accompanied by sandwiches, cakes and scones with jam and fresh cream.
A truly loverly experience and idea as a special treat.",5,2021,10,27
119,Great place for a private business dinner,"Amazing drinks and dinner at the Sunborn yacht. Great location and fantastic view - the food was excellent and well served (always tricky at business dinners to orchestrate how it will work, but they made it easy). Good portions and pleasing variety. Excellent!",5,2021,10,27
119,"Looks good in the pictures, not good in the flesh","So, we booked a suite with all the extras for our two night stay for a business trip. Was really looking forward to it but all went down hill from the moment we arrived. First we were told the ""hotel2 was double booked and we would have to accept a down graded room ...hmmmm not nice. But we were stuck for time and accepted . The room was dingy and unclean , in fact we had to call for the bed to be re made . We ordered a twin as being two tall men did not want to share..but we got a double and told it was the last. After haveing no option we had to carry on. We went to the very bland bar and was charged £15 for double gin and tonic. The staff here are very robotic and rude does not even begin to describe their attitude. I think they need to be retrained.
I would not stay here again and if pushed again would opt for something further away rather than be forced to not enjoy my stay.
This is my honest opinion of this hotel",2,2021,10,25
119,Awful,We stayed here on our honeymoon for 1 night and it was a horrible experience. Room was bare - no tablet and the shelf in the mini fridge was broken. The air con also wasn’t working and we were absolutely sweating all night and trying to dry my hair in the morning was horrendous due to the heat! We couldn’t wait to leave - I think it was the first time we actually left 2 hours earlier than check out time. Wouldn’t recommend!,1,2021,10,25
119,Wonderful Hotel experience but poor restaurant,"Beautiful luxury Yacht moored in Royal Victoria Dock. We booked via ‘Secret Escapes’ a Classic room  1026 on the first floor. Entrance to the hotel was via small lift that took you to the reception. The room was very large with huge porthole window. The bed was very large and comfy with beautiful white sheets. The facilities in the room were adequate. Air conditioning was available but quite noisy. The only drawback was the continue drone of an air con unit in another room throughout the night.
The bar was fantastic with great views but expensive as you would expect.
Breakfast in the morning was exceptionally good.
My advice would be eat out in the evening as the restaurant although beautiful was very very expensive and the food didn’t match the high prices. 
My bill came to £169 for two of us although I did get a £20 refund as they overcharged me for two glasses of wine.
There are many lovely restaurants in the area so go out and find one.
In all a lovely night stay spoilt a little by the restaurant experience.",4,2021,10,24
119,Satisfied ,"It was my first time staying here, the room looked nice and rhe view was even better throug the hotel room. In the morning on breakfast, Tatiana was nice, polite and helpful lady, she seems to care a lot about people who stay over, we had a nice chat and this made my stay even nicer. ",5,2021,10,21
119,Going to watch bond at the o2 plus other things,"A novelty hotel.My opinion only.One stay is suffice.Staff on reception a little grumpy which is not what you want on arrival.Our room with balcony was definitely interesting.Just like being in a boat of course but much better.Comfortable seating area leading to a cosy bedroom with great storage for clothes etc.TVs in both rooms
and a separate en suite bathroom with a wonderful size bath and fantastic shower.
The ship itself is fairly glamorous and you certainly feel like you have money(we don’t🥴)But the feeling good.The major let downs are staff for sure.Not very forthcoming.Bar personnel not the most efficient and service of drinks so time consuming,waiting for ages even when it was quiet.Breakfast best sail down the docks than consuming the food.Maybe it was busy prior to we arrived but not a good variety of fruit etc etc.My partner brought to the table in her hands,milk portions and butter portions and toast wrapped in a napkin as no plates.A la carte breakfast plus the starters not the standard for the price that we paid.One last thing on our last night we ordered a taxi,reception staff informed us it was outside by the barrier.It was not until 5 minutes later.Waiting in Rain and wind for my partner and her friend does not go down well when they spend good time looking presentable for an important evening out.Maybe,again only my opinion as a good old class song says,walk on by.",3,2021,10,21
119,Grim,"Grim. We had originally booked for a date that fell in lockdown. Sunborn refused to refund us so we chose an alternate date later in 2020. It was supposed to be a treat for our 25th wedding anniversary. To be honest it was more of an ordeal. Our welcome was less than friendly and it went downhill from there. On a more positive note we travelled across London to have dinner at the Oxo Tower and that was fabulous, thank goodness.",1,2021,10,20
119,"Good experience, thank you Ilona","Stayed for few times already but never had a time to write a review. 
Hotel conveniently located close to Excel and O2 arena.
Had some issues with booking and while staying, however Ilona was very friendly, helpful and always ready to help to resolve all of them! Thats why 5*",5,2021,10,19
119,Thanks to Wowcher I stayed here!,"So first off let me just say I would never normally be able to afford or justify the cost of a stay at the Sunborn Yacht Hotel. Thanks to a Wowcher deal I took the plunge back in April and booked for our wedding anniversary in early September! 

Sadly we both got covid but the hotel were kind enough to allow me to change to mid October for my wife's birthday weekend instead. 

As we only stayed one night and didn't use the bar, restaurant or any facilities I can only comment on service, room itself and breakfast.

So the room was great, we had river view ( an upgrade option) so more to see than side of a building. In fact we could see O2 and cable car to the right and city airport runway to the left...with a few swans, dockside apartments and some swans swimming in between! 

Bed was very big and very comfortable, not soft and squidgy like in many cheaper hotels! It was nice and quiet in general although far too hot. We turned radiator off but window was fixed shut so no fresh air which wasn't so nice. Bathroom was compact functional and the shower was powerful and nice and hot too! 

The English cooked breakfast was a large plateful and very tasty, despite waiting twenty minutes from time we were seated. Others arrived after us and got theirs before us so may e we were in the ""Wowcher section"" of the restaurant for the non full price paying customers? 

As far as location goes the Sunborn Yacht is in a good place with DLR station just a few mins walk away and the Emirates cable car over to the O2 a couple of mins away as well ( if you can do a night crossing as it's quite enchanting all lit up!) ",4,2021,10,16
119,Josh is THE BEST. A credit to Sunborn,"Josh was incredible. He was warm, friendly, efficient, welcoming and professional young man. Thank you for making our romantic evening special. We will most definitely be back. Keyanna was an amazing young lady, very friendly and professional",5,2021,10,14
119,Best of the best,"What an experience at this hotel,only had the dock view but fantastic stay and breakfast was a treat plus the staff where great.Lots of things to do and so close to o2 and river sports plus many a restaurant at reasonable price and feels like a proper ship.",5,2021,10,10
119,A Bit of Super-Yacht Glamour! ,"This gives a bit of Super-Yacht glamour! Built for a Billionaire who never took delivery of it, it lets you enjoy a floating palace that you otherwise would never have the privaledge of experiencing.........how one man could own such a lavish yacht!
Our room )the smallest) was a junior suite and absolutely huge! The details - etched mirrors, inlaid wood marquetry, glass cabinets and thick luxurious carpeting. The only reminder that you are on a boat is the smallish cabin-style bathroom.  But it was adequate and all you need.
Sum up......Stay here and enjoy the Billionaire lifestyle!",5,2021,10,08
119,AVOID ..BOOK NOVITEL NEXT TO IT,Soon as we arrived the reception told us our room isn't available..so they upsale us told us we had to pay more just so we can have a room for tonight. Me and my partner been travelling for about 3 hours so I wasn't going to argue as I was tired. We went to the room. Toilet didn't even flush.  The balcony was covered in water so we couldn't enjoy the veiw. The bed was soo hard it felt like I was sleeping on the floor. After getting changed me and my partner went to the bar.. the host told us to sit down next to the window someone will be over shorty... 15mins has past and we have made eye contact with the host multiple of times..  she was too busy worrying how she looked in the reflection and talking to another male employee. I mean its a hotel   go get a room! Me and my partner got up and left . Next morning.  Breakfast was absolutely trash..  you can tell everything was in a hot hold.  Eggs dry Susages dry tomatoe not even grilled bacon soggy covered in oil. Not a good experience never going back. Trash hotel. 1/10 rating.,1,2021,10,08
119,Poor costumer service,I wanted to book a place to stay for my wifes birthday and im trying to ring the reception as they hang up on me 4x pretending they couldn’t hear me as im using 3 phones to contact them thank God there is trip advisor as im reading the reviews not recommended to stay as staff was very rude,1,2021,10,07
119,Mixed feelings,"Stayed here for a special occasion which I mentioned upon booking. Was informed a note would be made on the booking but no mention of it upon arrival and nothing special added to the room. Not expecting the World but just something small would have been nice. 

Check in was slow and not what I have experienced in other hotels - luckily we were able to leave our bags as we arrived before check in. After returning at check in time I was informed our room was not ready despite other guests managing to check in without issue. I went to the desk a few times to ask if we could check in to be told our room wasn’t ready. I was then asked for a £40 deposit which I didn’t mind however the money wasn’t taken so not sure what the propose of that was. One receptionist was just interested in trying to get me to upgrade my room when I asked how much I was told £60 despite another guest being offered it for £20!! We didn’t upgrade as I had read previous reviews about the Thames view rooms not being much different and we weren’t going to be there long enough to appreciate it due to plans in the city.

Room was ok, bed was comfy. Coffee machine didn’t work and was really loud! 

Breakfast was good and the waitress was very friendly. You ordered the cooked food and there were cereals, yoghurt, fruit and pastries available. 

Check out was straightforward.

Reception entrance is lovely with a staircase and chandelier. I asked to go out on deck to take photos which I had seen other guests do from previous reviews. I was told this wasn’t possible due to it only being open for functions. 

All in all an ok stay but some improvements could be made to make it a better stay.",3,2021,10,06
119,Overcharged,"I was so looking forward to treating my wife at this hotel for our anniversary. Unfortunately, the hotel failed to live up to our expectations. The hotel room was decent in that it was clean and spacious overlooking the the bay which was beautiful. However,  on checkout the staff was unhelpful and appeared confused when sorting out payment.  I have since found out that they have overcharged me which is what I was concerned about on checking out. I have called the hotel about 20 times trying to get the matter rectified. When I finally got through to front desk, they gave me incorrect email address which means me having to call them up for another 20 times in order to get correct email address - I’ve been on hold for 30 minutes waiting for them to answer the phone.  Their customer service is poor so to avoid any further hassle, I will not be staying at this hotel again.",1,2021,10,05
119,Very disappointing all around,"Sad to say that the this was a very disappointing experience.  We were travelling as a group for business but had to bring our small child with us. A last minute cancellation meant we ended up here, rather than our planned accommodation and had to pay a lot for a last minute booking.

You are paying a lot of money to stay on a boat, little more. The rooms are spacious with a good view with a balcony. Rooms are clean, if not a bit dated. Most of the staff are very friendly (especially Bonnie on the breakfast team). Sadly that is where the good points end.  With the exception of the lobby, tbh, there isn't much else to the hotel.  

If you want a cup of tea, bring your own cup. You get maybe 3 sips out of the cups they provide at best. There is nowhere to put the kettle if you want to have some space at the desk.

On the first full morning, we took our daughter to breakfast and it took ages to find a high chair. When the staff did find it, it was broken. The staff attempted to improvise a solution which semi-worked but was not really acceptable. They found a second chair the next day but with two babies in the party, one of them had a broken chair at each meal.

The breakfast menu is limited to a very small number of cooked items.  Only toast and yoghurt is available to help yourself. No continental selection at all which is not great for a prolonged stay. You had to ask for cereal (didn’t realise that until the 3rd day).  Coffee was disgusting. Didn’t realise until the last day that other more interesting coffees were available on request (but not advertised at all).

When we arrived, we went to the bar space at about 5pm. The outdoor deck by the bar was full so we asked the waiter if we could sit upstairs at the ‘restaurant’ bar to have a drink and enjoy the view. He said fine. Went upstairs…the waitress just said ‘but this is a restaurant…you can’t have a drink only, you have to order food.’ It was 5 o’clock! There was literally no one in the restaurant. We wanted to just sit in the sun and enjoy a 18 quid cocktail. The upper deck was shut every day for private functions.

They clearly aren’t accustomed to seeing children.  Highchairs notwithstanding, I was asked more than once whether I needed any help (like I shouldn’t be there) when walking through the reception carrying my daughter which felt quite insulting.  The doors for the rooms are not wide enough to get a pushchair through without removing the wheels (goodness knows how disabled people get access!). When I asked if I could put an ice pack in the hotel freezer so I could store milk for the baby when working (which I have done many times in other hotels when travelling), the person on reception responded with ‘I don’t know if we have a freezer’! After looking stunned and asking again, they asked what was in the ice pack and why I wanted to store it. They eventually agreed but it was very strange line of questioning.  Tbh, I have no clue what is in freezer blocks...freezer gel??

We had 3 rooms for effectively a full week which meant a hefty bill. Two of our party had to return home two nights early because their child was unwell. The hotel agreed to refund the second night but said it was too late to refund the first. We completely accepted this and we’re grateful for the second night refund. Seeing as we had to pay for the first night for an otherwise empty room, we put a couple of large items in there and thought nothing of it. That afternoon, we had reception call to demand the room key back…even though we were paying for the room for that night. I still don’t understand the logic in this request. Apparently because they refunded the second night, we should return the key on the first night?? If they were refunding the first night too then of course the key would have been returned but I don’t see how a hotel thinks it is acceptable to demand the return of a room key which we are still paying for!

On the last night, our baby was sick so I had to go to reception at the middle of the night to request some new bedding.  The first person I spoke with just sort of stared at me blankly.  Thankfully his colleague overheard and stepped in and arranged for some clean bedding to be sent and a bag to put the dirty into.  The second gentleman was very kind (unfortunately I don't recall his name) but again, it just seemed odd that the first person didn't seem to have a clue what I was asking.

Like I said, it was generally just very disappointing. Individually, each of the incidents mentioned could be easily dismissed but all of them together are not really acceptable for a hotel claiming to offer a luxury experience.  Everything felt like an imposition. I don’t fault the staff (most of whom were very friendly), but nothing seems to work right.",2,2021,10,04
119,Good location if staying at O2,We had a cabin overlooking the Thames. Very spacious and clean. Only thing that let down our stay was the restaurant. Our friend's food arrived cold. By the time it was replaced we had finished. Breakfast very slow. May have been due to convention. ,3,2021,10,03
119,Don’t bother staying grand from the outside then the money pit starts if you not got loads of money then pointless,"Well what can I say .. such a shame as I was really looking forward to staying at this hotel for years finally had the money to stay here, I tried to ring reception to ask where sunborn was because from excel no signposts finally found the barrier no parking for guests you have to pay £20 for car park opposite lucky I have a disability badge so parked outside which was in between trees bizarre. When we arrived we had to wait 20 mins for the lift to get into the boat in the rain & cold weather when you enter the reception is beautiful with grand staircase & chandelier seating all around I had booked directly from the website we waited 10 mins to check in so not too bad but no sorry for waiting greeted by a male receptionist who sounded like he had the ump I was told I had to pay £40 pre booking payment which was taken straight away I’ve stayed in expensive hotels all over the world and never been asked to do this so I was already £40 down not great after spending £220 on a room & £15 extra for breakfast I even asked if I could give this in cash but was told no it has to be card for damages - damages I’m not a hooglian I had put a request if anything can be done to make our visit special as it was my birthday and our wedding I was told do I want to pay for the extra special occasion/ birthday package which was £75 with them both I said I can’t pay that he rolled his eyes and Huffed no freebies I wasn’t expecting the world but maybe 1 free drink each wouldn’t hurt I was made to fee like I was a scumbag. Waiting for the lift took 20 mins all the guests cramming inside the bedroom was standard seaview cabin it was pleasant shocked to find no water in the rooms you have pay £6.50 for this , no information about the boat, coffee/ tea pods not labelled so don’t know what you are putting in the machine - no biscuits- no shower gel just a mini bar of soap bathroom very outdated needs work scum round the shower, tiles needed grouting under sink broken under floor heating makes the bathroom sweating - pillows filthy make up and marks on the cases the beds are two singles together so we kept falling down the gap bed very uncomfortable and hard pillows not a great quality - room service menu is better then in the restaurant & bar service charge of £5 to use this , air conditioning was good, fridge is very noisy, pipes making noises, walls very thin can hear neighbors tv windows need to be cleaned mould in the grooves. 
Disappointed not have a bath. You have to upgrade your room to have this luxury. we didn’t we didn’t like the over priced restaurant menu, we ated in the bar which the tables were so low and chairs hard to move to the table  I had mozzarella salad for starter and hubby had squid my salad was tiny portion the mozzarella was creamy mousse mess rather then a Pearl of mozzarella, main we had the sliders of burger we got 6 mini burgers  1 tiny bowl of chips between us & one coleslaw we paid £30 for two potions there wasn’t enough for two people dessert I had dark chocolate cheesecake & hubby had passion fruit cheesecake which was lovely tiny but lovely drinks were overpriced the first cocktail blue lagoon had 5 types of spirt in the glass it was so strong it was like drinking paint stripper I asked for lemonade in the glass which I was charged £3.50 second cocktail was better but still not pleasant £15 each for disgusting cocktails which no garnish is disgusting I’ve had better cocktails in a pub hubby had a beer it tasted off he told the waiter which it was changed they were so helpful as he was embarrassed when I was charged £3.50 for lemonade for a drink that was vile apart from one waitress spilled a drink all down my dress and legs then nearly dropping off the table she was very sorry but I still had drink down me the bill came to a whopping £145 we was told we had to pay can’t  put  on a tab as I wanted settled up the next day the lady watched over us scrabbling finding the correct money from cards as it   was liked we not to be trusted  like thieves they made us feel like cheap I was keeping check of my sending then we noticed they have put on a service charge of £40 really day light robbery we noticed thick spider webs on the ceiling it was like they put Halloween up my only pet hate but the waiters they don’t leave you alone every 5 mins are you ok? Bit much. The bar balcony offers beautiful views over Greenwich. Wished there was entertainment on the boat as it’s a bit boring after dinner nothing to do to make it feel like you are on a ship especially when some people are spending £600+ for rooms. Sleep was hard as room was very noisy with pipes, fridge and neighbors noise. Breakfast was not great it was like eating plastic play food you get for kids, I can’t believe I paid £15 for this - it has egg Benedict or pancakes on the menu but chargers more i thought a buffet was supposed eat what you want not restrictions on we was told by a rude waitress if we eat anything else we will be charged again I had 2 sausages bacon hash brown & cold toast not worth £15 had better breakfast in little chef or McDonald’s only one hot drink or juice not both or you have to pay extra no cereals or conditional pastry’s fruit like In travel lodge the hotel next door looked like they had better breakfast. Trip was spoilt supposed been a special weekend disappointed shame I had to blog about my experience which was bad and tell my followers, I’m still waiting for my £40 fee. No info about the spa or treatments disappointed was restricted to visiting the top floor deck staircase was cornered off there was no function either sorry sunborn I will not been returning it’s overpriced, grubby outdated & disappointing still to other hotels in futures. My only wish is I saved up more to afford this trip from all the hidden chargers",2,2021,10,02
119,An unexpected gem,Great room. Excellent view. Josh the bartender was brilliant so welcoming and helpful and made us bespoke cocktails which were wonderful. Gorgeous comfy beds and breakfast in our room was honestly the best hotel breakfast I've ever had. An unexpected gem.,4,2021,10,02
119,Dirty towel in room!!!,"We stayed in this yacht for one night for a birthday. The first room we had booked was am executive room which had nothing different from a normal room other than a tiny balcony with a rather miserable view of excel, curtains had to be kept closed otherwise those outside could see in.
The other room had a river view which was nice. One of us had a shower upon check in, we then had house keeping knock to say ""sorry here are your clean towels"" we explained we had already used the one towel availible and she replied ""oh"" making it extremely obvious we had used someone else's dirty towel. This left us wondering what else in the room wasn't clean? Left a customer complaint via email to be told that we are mistaken and making it up and got no further replies when I challenged this. Upon reading reviews on here it seems common that rooms aren't cleaned properly and staff are rude and dismissive.
The bar also closes at 10pm which is insanely early for a Saturday night, and the main bar had a loud Event meaning we couldn't use that deck. There was also only one working lift so we resulted in just using the stairs.
This was an expensive stay and definitely not worth the money.",1,2021,10,01
119,AVOID AT ALL COSTS,"Don’t waste your time! My partner and I stayed here on Saturday night as a birthday treat. 
What a shambles. 
1 lift in use the whole time. Guests piling in and out all together, queuing endlessly. 
A private function was ongoing in the main bar, meaning guests could only use a smaller bar, was not disclosed at check-in - this meant a restricted menu with no cocktails, mocktails or draught beers. Two separate waiters told us this and so our visit at the bar was understandably short lived and disappointing.  

The hotel room phone was not working. 
We tried to call reception using a mobile phone to order room service in the morning, after around 25 minutes trying differing extensions with no staff answering the phone we gave up and left.

I emailed the hotel to complain and the assistant front desk manager - Sami Ullah - replied implying that we were not telling the truth. She said that she didn’t agree with what we said about the bar and menu restriction as this was not the case and a full menu was on offer. 
She also said that we should have used the mobile phone app to order room service. This would have been a great idea had we been told about it upon check in! 
She also said we should have contacted her when we were there - another great idea had the phones been working and had we not had to fight for a place in the only operational lift to get to reception. 
Sami Ullah went further to say that the premium price paid for the room is due to the novelty of the yacht and in line with any other 4* hotel in London. 
Customer service to be admired here!
Sami put a telephone number on the email which I immediately attempted to call having been accused of lying. No surprise that it did not work!

Having paid £319 for a night here and had this experience I wouldn’t recommend it to anyone!

I would like to hope that Sami’s manager reads this and looks into her response to my original complaint, as her handling of the matter is beyond substandard.",1,2021,09,29
119,Gone downhill!,"We have stayed at the Sunborn a number of times, but the last stay was really poor. They must have filled the boat with as many people as possible, but with the least number of staff to look after them, we all know there is a staff shortage in the hospitality industry but this was ridiculous. Checking in took 40 minutes, breakfast took 40 mins to get in, air con not working properly, waiting time for drinks from the bar over half an hour. Uninterested staff who didn't want to listen to complaints. The whole experience was dissapointing in comparison to previous times, General Manager needs to have a look at what is going on. Time for us to look at alternatives!",2,2021,09,28
119,Honeymoon,"Booked as a present for day after wedding. Sister rang up to add romance package, was told she would be sent a link to pay never got sent link so tried ringing every half for next 3 hours as we was on route to check in and no answer. On arrival check in was what to expect but paid 40pounds for what I presumed was for mini bar (maybe I miss heard as on arrival to room fridge was empty not even a bottle of water)  I downloaded app so could look at menus for restaurant and decided we would go for breakfast the following morning and have eggs benedict that was on the app, we was greeted and seated and a scratty piece of paper put down with 3-4 items to choose from. To which I replied to waitress “I know what I’m having could I have the eggs benedict” an instant reply off her we don’t do that but was sharp and rude. The conversation continued with me asking why when on there app and found her very abrupt and rude. So decided we would go elsewhere for breakfast. A visit to reception to express my concern regarding the breakfast no water in room and no romance package, to a shrug of the shoulders and ill make a note (how do I reply to that) no apology or explanation apart from a member of staff next receptionist said they don’t put water in room due to covid. Now the evening back to room for 10pm my partner fancied something to eat so ordered online on the app at 10.45pm hadn’t come so used room phone to ring room service didn’t work tried reception didn’t work so googled reception number to see what was going on as been 45mins (2 scotch eggs ordered). Receptionist replied with will check with the kitchen and hung up, waited for 10 minutes as thought maybe they would ring me back and rang reception back, asked what was going on for a sharp I’ve just come on shift and kitchen is closed it’s 11pm you can have a pizza. I replied with I ordered around 10 and got attitude back on phone and thought forget this I’ll have a chat in morning on check out. Checkout was same issue not interested in complaints and took notes to log on system 

Overall yacht is nice novelty with some nice city views but  Staff are useless and rude. With working out of town a lot and stopping in some budget hotels I would say you would have a better experience with staff at travelodge,  ow and the 40pound that was taken is incase you order room service and has still not been credited back to my debit card 7 days so far",2,2021,09,27
119,Terrible is an understatement,"I arrived at the Sunborn boat hotel in london yesterday for 1 night. As I walked in to reception I was very impressed with how it was laid out with the beautiful stair case
and celing lighting. I checked in and couldn’t wait to see my executive family room with the balcony dock view. My booking was already paid for but I was asked to give my bank card to pre hold £40 deposit but they would cancel when I checked out.
I just gave a card that only held £20 in there as it wasn’t going to be taken out but the
card was declined . I asked why it’s declined if they weren’t taking anything out of the account. To cut a long story short I had to use my main account card for it to be accepted. The 3 of us went to the room and much to our surprise it was a lot smaller than I imagined with only a shower in the bathroom no bath and only towels, robes and products for 2 people. Nothing for the 3rd person and not even any bedding. I tried to call reception but the phone in our room was out of Oder. I tried to at least make a coffee but the power point I was trying to use didn’t work. I opened the fridge to find it was completely empty. I opened the door to the balcony to find only 2 chairs and not 3 and when you sat on them you didn’t have the dockside view as it was just the metal side of the boat and to high up to see over. Impossible to move the chairs as the balcony was so tiny. I went to reception to let them know about all missing items and stated how unhappy I was and that I would like to upgrade as I couldn’t possibly be paying for an executive room looking like that. The man in reception said sorry we don’t have another room we are fully booked but housekeeping will bring all that is missing to your room. One of the staff came in to make the sofa bed up to then be told it was broken so we would need to be moved to another room being told we need to go back to reception . There was only one lift working. We then went to another room in which we were far happier with but expected to have a room like that in the first place. We went to the bar in the hotel and ordered rosemary salted fries which came out with no seasoning at all. We were booked in for a meal at 9 pm in the Lands End restaurant for 9 pm and the main meal being around £30. The meals came out and weren’t even hot and actually tasted as though had been sat under the kitchen lights keeping warm rather than cooked fresh. It wasn’t to how described on the menu and when I called one of the waiters over he was so polite and got the manager for me. He argued that there wasn’t anything missing and that there was a tiny amt in amongst the other items on the plate but unable to point out to us. Basically we had 2 peice’s of lamb which was piled high with mint sauce and 3 peices of asparagus with a huge amount of green peas which were sat on a plate of green rubbery like dark cabbage.
He went to see the chef who would have seen that hardly anything was eaten but came back insisting that because the meat had been eaten there was nothing he was going to do about it. We went for breakfast the following morning which again was 
awful. No cereal at all. Just white or brown bread for toast with jams and a cooked breakfast I can can tell you, had been sat under heat lights in the kitchen. Tea and coffee and apple juice and orange juice. When asked for mayonnaise for the chips without the seasoning the waiter bought a little glass jar over which had already been opened and half used by somebody else and  he was so embarrassed he couldn’t appologise enough and said himself it was disgusting. I always choose 5* hotels and this was a 4* hotel. Never did I imagine that was what to expect being it wasn’t 5* and just hope that nobody else pays hundreds of pounds to stay in this boat hotel just going by pictures of it that are beautiful and read the most up to date reviews first.",1,2021,09,27
119,Novelty,"This is a total novelty and I can’t see how this place has repeat business.
I expect to pay London prices and receive London service however basic cocktails which were extremely overpriced for what they were.
The wine menu basic and lacked choice.£40 for a pretty average steak was disappointing, restaurant lacked ambience and was freezing cold. 
The outside bar area offered a lovely view if only there were comfortable seats to sit and enjoy it on.
Great company with friends, shame about the rest of the experience.",2,2021,09,27
119,Great hotel if you want something a bit different ,"Stayed at the Sunborn 25/09/21-26/09/21 with my husband and friends. Hotel is lovely, clean and rooms are spacious. We didn't have much time there as we had other plans which is a shame, as would love to have just sat around the hotel as it has a cruise vibe about it. Breakfast wasn't great, we waited a long time and the staff seemed a little chaotic, but we did pitch up during peak time and food was nice. The reception staff were amazing and the night we got there, our room key didn't work and the receptionist didn't hesitate to help us and even come to the room to check everything. On both days a lady named Sarah (think she may be a manager or should be) was on the main desk. So lovely, attentive and professional to the guests, even when you could see that things were stressful for them. Would definitely stay again and would recommend even if a little pricey!",4,2021,09,27
119,Basic afternoon tea,"I booked an afternoon tea for my husband for his birthday. We asked to sit by the window to have the view and they did move us to that was great. Once we had the menu.  No one came back to ask us what tea we wanted. They set the afternoon tea stands down, it all looked very nice. But they sandwiches tasted soggy. When picking them up the looked like a sponge and when you held them they made a noise like they had far to much moisture on them. The cucumber and cream cheese was disgusting. The almond tart was completely overcooked, dry and crunchy. We waited so long for someone to come back, when they did.  We had nearly finished the food, so we asked for tea. The fruit tea tasted like someone had stirred in earth. The English tea was lovely. The egg roll was the best thing about it. My daughters love scones, but they didn’t finish them. They said they tasted more like bread. I also think they should do one without sultans. When the cocktail came it fizzed up going all over the table. I cleaned it up and no one brought a new one. This is an amazing setting and the yacht fantastic. It should be a brilliant experience but sadly it was basic. They need to up their game big time. We did talk to the manager who offered us more food. But to be honest. Who would want it. Wasted money.",2,2021,09,26
119,Romantic getaway,"Stayed for one night. Lovely room. Helpful staff. Told restaurant was fully booked from 530pm to 930pm on a Sunday evening so Reception kindly offered to reserve a table at 9pm as my Birthday treat was reason for our stay. So we had bar snacks and drinks at 5pm to keep us going until late dinner reservation, but when arrived at 9pm no table had been booked as promised & too late to go elsewhere! Yet the waitress on duty Nadige very quickly sorted out a table for 2 and took our order plus arranged for our breakfast in bed request to be placed. If not for her prompt and excellent customer service our stay would of been ruined with no dinner but she saved the day and we thank her for that as very impressed she quickly sorted it out for us. The restaurant was half empty anyways. Food expensive but vwry good. Overall a unique venue and experience.",4,2021,09,23
119,Wonderful Yacht,"It was an impressive sight to see the Sunborn Yacht from the cable car, a short 5 minute walk. We checked in and made our way to our cabin…. Very nice. We then made our way to the aft deck to have a drink, drinks and snacks were ordered. When our drinks and food came we had to ask the waiter for some napkins as the ‘wings’ were going to be messy, my wife had to get a side plate herself for the eaten ones, next time bring them with the food. When the evening came we were eating in the ‘Lands End’ restaurant but before we thought we’d drink in the sundown bar once again, our drinks were ordered, table service due to Covid, drinks ordered waited and waited… hello where’s our drinks…. Ooops still on the bar. Come on guys you need to raise your game! That said our meal in the Lands End was wonderful, service a little erratic. Hence the low rating I have given to a wonderful Yacht in   an impressive location.",3,2021,09,23
119,Treat night,"Arriving in the lift and entering into a beautifully lit reception was a great start to overnight stay. Checked in easily and proceeded to lift to go down to my room. Room was on lower level but was big and spacious with a couch and a huge bed which had lovely white crisp bedding. Bathroom very tidy and had toiletries and fluffy towels. Coffee machine in room was good but quite noisy if you decide to have a drink in the early hours. Only a small tray with 3 coffee pods, some teabags, sugar and 4 milk pods. Glad i was solo person as this wouldn’t have lasted long. No bottled water in room which was a surprise. Decided to go up to the bar for a snack about 9, member of staff gave me a menu and i sat down at table and they said they would be back to get my order. After 10 minutes of noone coming for order i just went back to room, bar was not busy there were only 6 other tables with people at them, couldn’t understand noone coming back for order. Anyway reasonable night’s sleep, up showered, breakfast 8. Staff member very helpful showed me to table explained menu and buffet style juice, beverages, toast etc. Breakfast came and looked lovely but not sure what kind of fat/oil hash browns and sausages had been cooked in but they had a funny taste. Beans were cold. Didn’t complain as i was one of the first in for breakfast and it hopefully was just a blip. Checked out which was easy.",4,2021,09,20
119,A lovely night away great gift idea for somebody,"I booked this for mine and my husbands 30th birthday after a day of activities in London. We loved the food, the room and the cocktails!
Our trip was made extra special by the kindness of a barman called Joshua who was very attentive and made the nicest cocktails I’ve ever had!!!! Thank you Joshua and I hope you get the recognition you deserve. The views of the city are stunning and the beds comfortable!
Would come again and would lobe to try the afternoon tea!",5,2021,09,19
119,Loved every minute,"We arrived an hour earlier to check in, our room was ready, luckily for us. The rooms are lovely, lots of polished wood and large. The bar gas a small terrace to sit on, it was sunny and so we spent an hour or so here. You can see the O2 and emirates cable cars in the distance.  Friendly, helpful staff. We had tea & coffee in the room and a Lavazza coffee machine which made really tasty coffee. TV worked well and we heard no noise whatsoever all night. Comfortable huge bed. The reception is really stunning with a big chandelier and stairs going up to the restaurant area. Breakfast is served from 8am on a sunday and there is a notice saying to get there before 9am or it gets busy. We got to breakfast at 8.45am it was quiet for 10 minutes then there were queues constantly and still queues when we exited. There is a full cooked breakfast which was tasty. Coffee, tea, toast, juices that are self service. We loved our stay and will come again.",5,2021,09,19
119,Nice to do!,"We'd wanted to stay here for a while. Location was spot on for the O2 which is what we wanted, the reception staff were very friendly, huge bed was very comfortable but areas are dated, amenities in the room are not what you'd expect for the price you're paying, the bar staff rude and service was very slow. Breakfast was excellent once we'd got through the 30 minute wait to be seated. It was nice to do but I wouldn't stay again.",3,2021,09,19
119,Mixed feelings,"Lovely spot and a very nice stay. But £15 for 2 beers is extortionate. Meaning it's too expensive to drink on ship.
Breakfast is a farce, 20 minute wait, no staff clearing tables, when breakfast did turn up it was very nice.
Won't be staying again",2,2021,09,19
119,Could not fault this experience,"Arrived.. Lovely welcome
Got up graded for small price.. It was sooo worth it
Breakfast amazing

Shops within walking distance  if you want to purchase beverages for in the comfort if your room.. Or food... 

Clean. Well staffed and we would return

We really enjoyed our stay ❤️",5,2021,09,15
119,Interesting and pleasant experience,"We stayed on the yacht for one night in September 2021. The closest station to the yacht is Excel on the Docklands Light Railway which is only a short walk from the dockside where the yacht is moored. On arrival the external lifts were a little confusing, with the information plate on how to call the lift to get up to the reception being blocked by a plant pot! However, once inside we were quickly checked in and also offered an upgrade to a balcony cabin for only a small additional fee which we took and felt that this was a very good value upgrade. The public areas of the yacht are spectacular with polished wood, mirrors and glass. The staff were generally friendly, especially the man who dealt with us on reception. The rooms were well insulated from sound - whilst there was a party going on in the 5th floor function room we could hear virtually nothing despite only being two cabins away. The breakfast service was brisk and although there was a queue when we turned up at 9am, it cleared quickly. The breakfast was reasonably good and when the buffet items ran out these were quickly replenished. 

The one thing we thought a bit odd was that the bar closed at 2230 so when we returned from attending our evening event, we could not have a drink as the bar had already closed. Overall, we felt that for the price we paid, the yacht hotel was good value and we would certainly stay again.",4,2021,09,14
119,Would stay again.,"Had a lovley nights stay here for my 30th birthday. 
We went to the Sandown bar, and had an amazing waiter called Josh which I would like to make sure he gets the recognition for. He really couldn't do enough to accommodate you, he made my partner a drink as a surprise and he knew my partners measure straight away and got him a signature drink called the 'godfather"" he was amazing and one of the most friendliest barman you will ever meet and always had the time to talk to you even whilst serving and clearing. 

We booked a table at the lands end restaurant and the food and quality was amazing, there was nothing I could fault on the food it was incredible. So much so we would happily go back just for a meal. 

",5,2021,09,13
119,A little bit disappointed,"Felt that the reception staff need some training on welcoming you on the yacht. 
Bar  staff very friendly and gave you a big smile as you entered and very pleasant Josh was very welcoming and explained that it was table service and someone would be with you soon. 
Felt rooms a bit dated as our dressing gown had dirty marks on and a bit worn looking and the same with the towels, in the bathroom tiles missing off the walls 
. Breakfast queue too long should of given times so that the the staff could cope better and that if you needed to go and get coffee or anything you wouldn’t have to cut through the queue, felt it would’ve been better if everyone had cued the other side of the staircase and the breakfast and a bit of a shame it wasn’t better quality.",3,2021,09,13
119,Trying to be something they are not.,"Me and my boyfriend stayed here from the 01/09/21 - 03/09/21. We arrived a bit before our checking in time, so we stored our bags and when we came to check in and collect our bags it took a good 30 minutes - 45 minutes. They only had two people on and they had quite a few customers waiting to be served. The guy we had his computer crashed so he had to move to another computer, which took him a good 10 minutes to log on. 

Once he logged on and sorted out some papers (which took longer than needed). he took our ticket for our luggage and searched in THREE different rooms in the end he gave it to another worker and told us to wait on the other side of the reception desk. The woman he gave the ticket to found our bags straight away and she went to where we were standing originally. 

The breakfast wasn't the best, the waitress came over and explained about the breakfast, which was fine. When we came to order our food, my boyfriend had a full english and I had pancakes, which were an extra charge of £8.95, which the waitress did not tell me when talking us through the menu). My boyfriends eggs were also off eggs as you could tell by the look of them, he had an upset tummy after eating their breakfast. 

We checked out and I asked about the deposit fee of £80 (deducting for the pancakes) and when it would be returned back on my card, he said in 3 working days, I am yet to still receive it and I've emailed them about it. 

The yacht is trying to be something it really isn't. The only grand bit about it is the staircase. The room itself was nice, but you could tell that it was a dated place. We stayed another night in London, where the price was half the price and the staff were much more efficient.",1,2021,09,13
119,DO NOT WASTE YOUR MONEY BOOKING HERE AS YOU WILL BE DISAPPOINTED,"Horrible experience due 2 the service & attitude of staff.  Room booked was not the room we got.  No cleaning of rooms with hair left in toilet, drinks in fridge & socks in cupboard.  Don't waste your £.",1,2021,09,13
119,70th birthday,We have just returned from an overnight stay and afternoon tea for my husband 70 th birthday. On check in we were upgraded to a river view and the staff service was second to none. The afternoon tea was beautiful with a lovely birthday touch. The room exceeded our expectations with happy birthday chocolates. Thank you to all the team you are doing a marvellous job and made our stay special. The yacht is incredible and the surroundings and atmosphere was lovely.,4,2021,09,13
119,"Nice stay, expensive drinks and food nothing special, hygiene needs sorting in the bar…",When the barman is constantly chewing his fingers between serving drinks then cutting strawberries and fruit then serving the fruit into glasses with no tongs just his dirty chewed fingers… .then fingers into dirty glasses as they clear them away then there putting them into clean glasses as they move the clean glasses around for the next customer.. a big circle of cross contamination.. disgusting,3,2021,09,12
119,Anniversary Trip,"What a place! As stunning on the inside as it is outside. All of the staff we encountered were lovely and very accommodating. Our room was 1045, it was a very lovely space,  with THE biggest and comfiest bed! The only thing I would have changed is to have booked the river view instead of the dock-view, but regardless of this, it was stunning. The air con was an absolute dream, and they had a Lavassa coffee machine in the room too, which I thought was a nice touch.

We had drinks at the Sundown Bar, and what a place...stunning views, especially at night! The drinks were normal London pricing, around £15-17 per cocktail. They also had a snack menu which offered a large variety of options.

We also ate at The Lands End Restaurant and I haven't got a negative word to say about this. The staff were again great from the get go. We had a lovely seat by the window so we could see the London skyline in all of its glory! The menu is big with a little bit of everything. We went for the Mackerel to start and the Cote De Bouf for main and I highly recommend!!

All round a fantastic night away!",5,2021,09,12
119,Wedding anniversary,"I don’t recommend to anyone….
I was mistreated from the moment of arrival until the check out…..
With shocking attitudes,erased the voice sometimes is with excuses that had no comem senses …
Where i made a reservation and in the end, no professionalism, they didn't give me what they sold me!
A bad service from everyone who made me very sad, being a special weekend….
After all these e-mails sent from one side to the other, we ended up without a bottle of water in the room, dinner a disaster …
Where the price to expensive for product that i had….
Come back never again and I don’t recommend to my worst enemy … 
I had a lot more to say, but I'm gonna to forget about the bad weekend we had…",1,2021,09,12
119,Don’t book here.  Service is rubbish. You will be disappointed,I’m getting married next weekend and my thoughtful and loving sister in law arranged a wonderful weekend for us including a night on this yacht hotel.  We didn’t get the riverside view booked and couldn’t go to the terrace due to a private function. The icing was a sock left in my room exemplifying the poor cleaning.  When raised to so called manager Noella she had no apology but rather attitude.  I will be logging a formal complaint.  Let’s see how that goes,1,2021,09,11
119,Amazing customer service from Tatyana,"We would like to draw the management's attention to Tatyana.  She's incredible.  Excellent communication and perfect customer service 5 ***** 
Thanks for the afternoon tea and delicious breakfast. 
Will definitely be back for more.",5,2021,09,09
119,Romantic weekend,"Impressive looking yacht,  lifts up to reception which came out to an
Impressive reception area. Check in was very smooth and very nice polite man on reception. Room was huge ! Shower was nice & powerful. The only thing I dropped a point for was how early the bar shut , 11pm. It was very busy but not packed. Nice to sit out on the terrace at night. Breakfast was very good , I had the salmon on toast & it was a very large portion and delicious",4,2021,09,08
119,5* Anniversary Celebration ,"My wife and I recently celebrated our 17th anniversary on board the the sunborn hotel we were greeted at reception by one of the most amazing receptionist and person. She was extremely passionate about her job which we noticed and felt her energy at first contact. She added a extra sparkle to our anniversary celebration. Thank you (Sarah)

We would also like to give a big thanks to another member of staff who also made our anniversary sparkle. Dorota : ) who reserved and escorted us to our table in the restaurant. Even behind her mask you could still see and feel the warmth of her smile, she gave excellent service.

In fact, Henrique in Reception, all the staff at the bar and waitresses were all amazing so much so I have made another reservation with my daughter so she can share in our experience on board the Sunborn Hotel.",5,2021,09,07
119,Enjoyable stay,"Our room was lovely, looked out over the Thames. Everywhere was very clean. Bed comfy, bathroom spotless, good shower. All the staff were friendly and polite. We had evening meal and breakfast booked too. The evening meal was disappointing, tbh. It was hard to choose a starter as there wasn't much of a choice. My husband chose an asparagus dish because that was the only he thought he might eat, but it wasn't good. The four of us had the ribeye steak, which was alright, but have had better elsewhere. 2 of our party had desserts, which were OK, and other 2 had cheese board. Not the best cheeses, but was OK. The drinks were very expensive. Although dinner was included in our stay, we still spent an additional £117 on a bottle of wine, 4 amaretto and cokes, 2 lemonade, 2 peppercorn sauce, and 4 x £6 supplement on the steaks.  Also included a 12.5 % service charge. Breakfast was better. We would go back to stay on the yacht, but wouldn't book for dinner. It is around 40 mins from central London.",4,2021,09,07
119,Disappointing stay,"We were very disappointed with our stay. It wasn’t a luxurious yacht at all. The room was big but the bathroom was very dated. There was no information in the room about anything, meal times, menus, not even a Gideons bible! Sarah checked us in and was not the most welcoming. Quite impatient actually. It was not a great start. We didn’t know how to use the lift and had to get out and ask her. Henrique checked us out and that was a much better experience. The bar has last orders at 10.30pm, something else we weren’t aware of! We got there at 10.29! I got up to get my drinks from the bar as they were just sitting there on the bar! They then had the cheek to charge me a service charge, which I refused to pay. We didn’t have breakfast (thank goodness) from the reviews I’ve read. It was not cheap for 2 nights but safe to say, we won’t be returning or recommending it to anyone. There was no water in the room and we were given 2 tea bags for a couple! Big deal one cup of tea each. Not even a biscuit was provided! We bought tea bags, milk and biscuits ourselves! So disappointing.",3,2021,09,06
119,A nice enough exoerience,Nice enough for a different experience. Falls short on being classed as luxurious. Decor and furniture very dated. Paid for the balcony but no furniture on it so couldn’t sit on it to enjoy the view. Given just enough coffee pods/tea bags etc for one drink if you are a couple. Could have supplied a couple of bottles of free water in the fridge! No access to any spa/pool facilities. Was told at breakfast you get one glass of juice and one tea or coffee! Come on guys. You need to up your game to be competitive. Said they couldn’t facilitate any requests for special occasions like birthdays/anniversaries etc! Wouldn’t hurt to be able to offer a few chocolates/flowers/wine with the prices being charged. Sounded like most people were celebrating some occasion so would have been a nice touch! Was a different experience but felt they could have tried a bit harder to make it special.,2,2021,09,05
119,Awful afternoon tea!,"Dated decor. The sandwiches were not made fresh the bread was a bit stale, the cocktail was disgusting, sparking wine with some cherry flavouring it was awful! Lots of clotted cream but the scones were tiny so no where to put it, which resulted in a lot of cream being wasted. We had to ask for tea 20 minutes in. It was not a great experience do not recommend, we left in 50 minutes. Shame as it was gift!",2,2021,09,05
119,Low end stay,"Expensive for what it is, although it is clean and we had a lovely view of the dock from our room. Executive Room was very basic and quite dated with a poor finish. We had no bottled water and only enough milk for one drink each. 
Expensive restaurant with mediocre service but high prices. Young inexperinced staff with masks hanging off their faces. 
Rib eye steak was over cooked with no steak knife. £34.  Fish with no fish knife £32. I was told I didn’t need a fish knife as it had been filleted. I would expect for their prices they would have this cutlery as a basic necessity. 
No real atmosphere in the restaurant or the sky lounge. Sky lounge closed on a Friday night too. 
Average breakfast- claimed it was cooked to order, but actually just served from a buffet in the kitchen. Fried eggs were hard and cold especially. 
On the whole the stay was ok. But I personally wouldn’t recommend it.",3,2021,09,04
119,Nice hotel,"The room was spacious, near a great Chinese restaurant as the bar was overpriced. Luxury all around, however, I just wish it had a few more perks. Would recommend to those who enjoy simple, well-done luxury.",4,2021,08,31
119,Weekend break,"Myself and my husband stayed at the hotel for one night. Our room was nice and was clean and very big. 
We had drinks in the bar and service was very slow considering bar area was not busy. 
Breakfast this morning was quite chaotic and I had to send my cooked breakfast back as it was cold although my husband’s was ok. 
Although we had these hiccups we enjoyed our stay.",3,2021,08,30
119,"Great hotel, service not so good","We stayed at the Sunborn for one night on a trip to London for my birthday. We arrived early and were told we could check in but it was taking some time to sort out the 4 rooms so we left reception to sort it out while we went into the city. On our return that evening it still took around 15 minutes to complete check in and add on breakfast for the next morning. When we arrived at breakfast we were told that it wasn’t included. The whole check in process seemed quite disorganised. 
Despite the problems with check in we enjoyed our stay. It was good to stay in something different to a normal hotel. The rooms were good with lots of space.",3,2021,08,30
119,Lovely,"We stayed for 1 night, beautiful rooms, super comfy bed, lovely welcoming reception team. Bar team really helpful. Breakfast was perfect.
Would definitely stay again. Only down point was prices in the bar, very expensive for a drink and also in an area with not much to do or see which isn't too bad as you can jump on the underground.... thankyou for a lovely stay",5,2021,08,29
119,Absolutely amazing,"We was looking for somewhere to take two little boys that was a little different. My son had two trips to Disney cancelled due to Covid, so I let him pick where we go. He absolutely loved the idea of staying on a boat so we opted for the Sunborn. I’m so so glad we did. Everything about this stay was perfect. The hotel is immaculate. The breakfast and evening meal were superb. The staff are friendly and welcoming. The bed, honestly the most comfy bed I have ever slept on. The best thing though was the service from a gentleman named Micheal. He went above and beyond to make this a special stay for both the adults and the children. I’ve never experienced such amazing service and thoughtfulness and I’ve stayed in many hotels. In my opinion this is a five star hotel and the service (thanks to Micheal) is the best in the world. When someone ensures the children have an amazing stay, as a parent you could wish for nothing more. Thank you for having us. We will be back.
There are also treatment rooms, we didn’t get to experience them but we are planning to the next time we stay. If you are considering staying at this hotel then go for it, you will not be disappointed.",5,2021,08,29
119,Awesome concept!,"Lovely hotel great setting fantastic cocktails, stayed Friday night very friendly staff like your on holiday nice cabin room feels like your abroad if the weather is nice watched the sunset too while sipping a cocktail, great breakfast too only downside was the bar closed at 11pm",4,2021,08,28
119,"Beautiful Yacht, Beautiful setting, Not enough staff, very expensive","Standard check in time of 15:00 but didn’t have enough reception staff. Only 3 guests in front and it took 40 mins to get to the front. No fluent English speaking receptionist and with a mask on was really hard to understand. Room was presented beautifully with riverside views. No water in fridge. Food was amazing but for a small glass of wine it was £9.50. But I suppose that’s london prices these days. 
Was a good nights sleep but you are under the flight path of London city airport. Didn’t take our bags to our room. 
But overall a good stay but definitely not 5 star service.",4,2021,08,28
119,Brilliant and different stay in London,"Would highly recommend this hotel , stayed in the executive double with river views and a balcony .
Room very good and spacious. Very clean . 
A good breakfast included in the price . 
Bar was nice drinks a bit over priced £6.50 for pint 🙄
Only bad points is the location is far from the centre. But tube station is walking distance and I would recommend the cable cars only £4 and takes you to o2.
Over all a great stay if you want something different in London .",5,2021,08,28
119,Over night stay,"Booked the sunborn for my partners birthday.  We had an amazing time even better than we expected. Great room with balcony and river view.  The food was lovely and the staff couldn't of been more helpful, really attentive. Would definitely recommend and we would stay again.  Thanks to you all for the great experience.",5,2021,08,27
119,"Overpriced, crammed and understaffed.","We have stayed at the Sunborn many times but feel this visit might be our last.
Would like to start with the positives…. the room was immaculately clean and a credit to housekeeping.
Also, the staff we spoke with were very polite.
The negatives….
One of the front lifts was broken the whole time we were there
There was a long queues at check in
There were exceptionally long breakfast queues and didn’t feel like there were enough tables for guests.and not enough breakfast staff for guests. 
The breakfast has limited choice and orders come out in random order, staff not sure where they were delivering plates to and felt like pot luck if you get a breakfast. No milk jugs, no cereal. Really not as enjoyable as previous visits
As mentioned the room was incredibly clean however the sofa bed kept collapsing. In previous visits there were Molton Brown toiletries, bottled water and a selection of cofees. These are all gone now.
At £270 per night for a family of 3 the quality of stay doesn’t feel like good value anymore.",3,2021,08,27
119,Average,"I stayed here with 2 friends in August.  We waited outside for a while for the lift as out of 2 there was only one working, so it took a while to actually get in on the hotel check in level.  
The check in was good. The receptionist was friendly and gave us all of the information we needed.
We found our room easily. It was quite big and the beds were comfortable.
The shower room was ok.  It didn’t seem sparkly clean but more like a budget hotel type room. 
The room seemed fine but the hotel just appeared to be underwhelming.  I thought it would be brighter and shinier !!  I can’t describe exactly how it was but I felt there was no atmosphere there.   It all seemed quite tired.  
The staff were all polite and welcoming.
Breakfast was ok but we all left most of it.  It was order only and not a buffet style.  Coffee ok but not very hot. 
I probably wouldn’t stay here again as we did it for the experience but nothing really made us want to return. I’ve stayed in the Sunborn in gibraltar and that’s in a different league altogether!",3,2021,08,25
119,"Do not stay at this hotel, overpriced and disappointing","It is myself and 2 sons, I got to say one of the worst rooms I've stayed in ever. 
days and nights, 3 nights

1. Bed uncomfortable, sofa bed, head keeps dropping to the floor.  worn furniture, ripped in places also.
2. We only get to go on to sleep after 11pm, due to the noise from people coming through the main door to the room on this section of the 2nd floor rooms. The room is directly in front of the main door leading to all 2nd floor rooms.
3. I would not count this an an executive room, basic at best, its a yacht hotel and charge over £140 per night...
4. Fridge is very noisy and we had to get someone to turn it off, so we had no cold drinks to chill. 
5. Had to call room service on their number and most days it rings and no answer, so I gave up.. This was in reference to the towels and fridge issue. Do they have staff working in the hotel.  it seem not on the account of one of the reps in the hotel restaurant
6. Breakfast, another part that needs attention it seems. Not only us it was an issue(the people on the other table had to wait on also1), but wait time is over 40 mins for food. On 2 occasions so far took long. The lady on front desk noted and stated not much staff in that dept. So what are we paying for, possibly just adequate service!! 
7. Wifi is rubbish, keeps dropping all the time, I had to use my own connection. 

All in all I will not be coming back and will be adding to the review.

i would recommend the crown plaza if you wanted to stay in the area, it has better facilities and probably more staff",1,2021,08,25
119,Be careful what you are told on their web site will not match what you recieve,"We booked on the Sunbourn App directly as it specified that we would get guaranteed best prices,  room upgrade if a room was available, late checkout and 10% discount in the bar and restaurant.

We did indeed get the best room rate, our room was great, top deck and clean.
Menu looked good but expensive and an additional service charge of 12.5% made it too expensive for us.
We went to reception to ask about the late checkout and 10% discount. The staff looked at us as though we were crazy. We were told that late checkout could only be up to 12.00 and after that £20 per hour. They told us that the late checkout and 10% discount had been removed from their web site. We then showed them their own Sunbourn App on our phone (from where we booked) and they still tried to say that was wrong and should have been removed. They even argued with me because I showed them their own App and they didn't have a clue what to do. They would take no further action, despite me telling them that this was false advertising, Their attitude was terrible and they were all so miserable on reception and couldn't care less.
We asked why there was no cereal at breakfast, they said it was put out last week, then another member of staff said no its not available. When we booked a choice was available at breakfast for eggs  benedict or eggs royal, we were then told this was available at extra cost.
Later that same day we noticed that the benefits previously mentioned on the App had been removed.
The attitude of the reception staff was not what I expect from a 4* hotel, apart from the lady on breakfast reception who was very polite, friendly and professional",3,2021,08,24
119,18-30’s Partying in the rooms and balcony till 5am.....,"What started as a Romantic stay in a junior suite with  all the extras,  was ruined by a neighbouring room having an all night party with a group of partygoers using a room and balcony as a party venue until the late hours

It was disappointing that the staff on duty turner a blind eye and did absolutely  nothing to stop it.  Even more disappointing is that although Sunborn were advised of this issue they have still not  responded to  me before this review.

The food was  also disappointing, it was ok and resembled average pub food. Certainly not 5 *as described , Very disappointing . Photos attached.

Dont waste your money unless your prepared to pay for a room you can’t sleep in and an average 3* meal.",1,2021,08,23
119,Dorota all the way!,"Dorota and her team were exemplary!

I found Senora Doritos very accommodating and her gentle yet firm manner was very welcoming-good job!

I also extend my thanks to Michael on front desk. 

The breakfast in particular was lovely and catered for diabetics like myself. 

Regards",5,2021,08,22
119,Average!!,"I had booked this two night stay for myself and my husband as a rare getaway from work/children etc. 
I had organised a bottle of champagne to be in the room on our arrival (not cheap I may add) .. We checked in and I paid for the champagne on arrival. Excited to see my husbands reaction as we walked in the room I was saddened and disappointed that there was no trace of the champagne to which I had to phone reception and chase, defeating the whole element of surprise.

The Room- to be fair our room was very clean, comfy and more than adequate for our two day stay. We did like the heated floor in the bathroom, a nice touch!

Dinner- We had dinner at the Lands End Restaurant excited to taste some amazing food and be well looked after. We ordered a starter to share which was delicious however mid way through eating it our main course arrived. With food in my hand the waiter took our starter away and replaced this with our main course. To say I was in shock was an understatement. Not only was this very rude but I was very much enjoying the food and was hoping to finish it considering how much we were paying for it! We then were told by the waiter we could have steak knives if we preferred however these were blunt so best to stick with the normal cutlery. Wow.. this is meant to be a 4 star hotel in London not a 2 star in Blackpool! 
I must say the steak was delicious, but I would not say worth the amount they are charging. 

If anyone is looking for a great restaurant to have dinner we found a fabulous place just around the corner called ‘Top 1 Forever’ way better than the Lands End and for half the price! 

Breakfast- a serious lack of choice, no fresh fruit, cereals or anything continental (which I was hoping for) as you usually get a choice in most other hotels. Very disappointed with what is my favourite meal of the day! 

Overall we had a comfy stay but this was hindered by the lack of attention to detail and all the  small things which If had been done right first time would not have left  us feeling disappointed and let down by the hotel.",3,2021,08,22
119,Disappointing in every aspect - would not recommend,"Where do I start!

We booked 2 rooms for my daughter’s 21st birthday. We paid for a birthday room upgrade, which consisted of a few balloons on the bed, a cheap birthday banner on the wall and 3 cheap balloons on ribbon next to the bed (see photo). We could have achieved all this for a fraction of the cost.

The main bar and main deck was out of use to residents due to a private function meaning that everyone had to use the small bar and deck on the top floor which took last orders at 10pm…. on a Saturday night.

The facilities in the room…..  a mini fridge which was tepid at best. 4  milk jiggers supplied to drink with espresso coffee (ok if you like strong coffee!). No water in the room. No shower gel in the room. The bathroom flooded (and I mean flooded) when showering as the water didn’t drain. On a positive note, the bed was big and very comfortable.

Breakfast cost £60 for 4. There weren’t any cereals, fruit, pastries, cheeses, ham or fresh bread on offer, only a toast machine for white or brown sliced bread. The milk jiggers returned again! We did find some fresh milk in a bottle (eventually) but had to ask for something to pour it into to take it to the table as this wasn’t supplied. The hot drinks were all DIY, with the coffee being served from a huge urn, which tasted disgusting. We saw someone from another table with an espresso, and later found out that machine coffee could be ordered but this wasn’t advertised anywhere or mentioned by any of the staff.

The Sunborn is advertised as a 4 star luxury yacht hotel. It is far from this! I have stayed in better Premier Inns with better breakfasts for much less money. I have also stayed in a lot of 4 star hotels and this does not even begin to compare.

I didn’t complain during our stay as I didn’t want to spoil my daughter’s birthday weekend. I did however contact them after check out with my feedback and have yet to receive an acknowledgement of the contact, which at the time of writing this was a week ago.

So disappointed with this hotel and would definitely not recommend. Save yourself some money and find a Premier Inn.",1,2021,08,22
119,Disappointing and gross,"I, perhaps naively, did not expected to have to wrap myself in a bathrobe covered in someone's poo. And it was poo! 

I booked this as a surprise stay for my partner's birthday. We stayed in the Yacht Executive Suite River View. As expected the room was exceptional: it had an enormous private balcony, with sun loungers, a living area with a sofa, a dining table, a separate bedroom and of course, the large bathroom complete with two showers, a sauna and the spa bath. 

I would have forgiven the poor experience at check in when the receptionist couldn't find my reservation, nor the pre-check in information I had sent 6 hours prior to our arrival. It took 4 attempts.

The hotel claims to have taken Covid safety measures and staff did were masks apart from the  person who brought up the drinks through room service and who insisted to come into the room with his mask on his chin. We had to pay for the drinks there and then (they could not be added to the final room bill because they were more expensive  than the deposit I had to leave at reception - on top of paying for the room on arrival (Thank you booking.com). He had to come inside the room because he could not carry a very wet ice bucket and take the payment (a trolley seemed appropriate, but not here!) . He left the dripping ice bucket on the wooden table with no napkin or towel to mop up the excess water or serve the drinks. We also had to scramble to open the bottle with what we guessed was a bottle opener on the toilets wall!! 

I could have forgiven that or that the food that came later also didn't have any napkins. Note that the room service charges are not advertised and the waiter even complained to us that we should have actually had been charged even more. 

What I did find most difficult to deal with was the neatly folded bathrobe that after we had a nice sauna and bath we hoped to use but was smeared in faeces. You read correctly (pics attached). It was late and didn't fancy a fuss, so left it till we checked out to discreetly mention it to reception who said nothing they could have done or will do, we should just have called at the time and just have it replaced. Just so you know this room will set you back over £500/ night.",2,2021,08,21
119,Novel yacht stay. ,"Just completed an overnight stay. 
Check in friendly and efficient. 
Room/cabin much larger than anticipated. Spotless room however the entrance to the hotel needed a good vac - poor first impression. 
Limited toiletries, powerful shower with plenty of hot water. 
TV would be better if updated to a smart tv.
Bed and pillows comfortable. 
No noisy neighbours, slept v well. 
Tesco express nearby so stocked up on wine to drink in room. 
Numerous restaurants nearby.
5 min walk to cable cars.
Took breakfast at 8.45am. Waited about 10 mins for a table by the window and  service was excellent.
You will love this place if you book it as a novel stay. Remember it’s a yacht, not a hotel. A cabin, not a room. 
I enjoyed my stay as I’m a cruiser so enjoyed being back in a cabin near water. ",4,2021,08,20
119,"Awful hotel, not luxury at all!!","Stayed here for our anniversary in a executive king room with river view and was very disappointed. we were greeted at reception and all seemed fine until we got to the room, we found the bathroom to be very dirty (black grout lines) which you don't expect to see from a 4 star hotel especially at the price you pay for a night. i was then greeted by ants in the bed so i went to reception and complained about it, the women on reception was rude about the situation and implied it was a fly. i showed her numerous pictures and also a video and they agreed to change our room to another exactly the same. we got to the new room and the bathroom was in the same state, this one also had a crack on the sink. seems all the bathrooms in this hotel need a good clean and re grouting! in the new room there was a damaged cabinet that had the glass doors taken off and never replaced (hardly a luxury experience). Rooms are not supplied with any water in the mini fridge, this can be bought from room service at a charge of £5 per bottle! We hated this experience and the only good thing i have to say about the hotel is the view. I've had a few friends that wanted to try out this hotel but i have told them to steer clear as personally this was a waste of money and ruined our anniversary",1,2021,08,18
119,Fantastic tea,"Had a fabulous tea at Sunborn to celebrate a friends birthday. Started off with a glass of Proseco, followed by sandwiches, scones, cream, jam and finally cakes . Staff were excellent.  The best tea I have had in a long time. Highly recommend!",5,2021,08,18
119,Fantastic,"Stayed for 1 night aboard the sunborn yacht hotel
For my husbands birthday . It exceeded my expectations. Quick and easy check in , as we arrived at 11am we done all the paperwork and they held our luggage for us . So when we came back later that afternoon we simply grabbed the keys 

We stayed in a classic river view room . It was very spacious and immaculate . 

Hot Breakfast you choose from a number of items and they bring it out to you . You help yourself to toast / yoghurt . I didn’t see any cereal or pastries  as advised on website . 

I would recommend this as nice alternative to a normal hotel . It really felt like we were on holiday. 

I would 100% stay here again . I’d like to try the afternoon tea :)",5,2021,08,18
119,Hotel from hell,"‼️DO NOT STAY HERE ‼️
 This hotel promises to give you a luxury experience...  I’m afraid they lied...
You will not get anything near luxury, what you will get though is an un-hoovered floor in your room,  a very strong smell of marijuana coming from rooms and guests banging noises throughout the night loud music until the early hours, and a sleepless night. The view is nice apart from when you look down and see floating condoms  and rubbish
Rude staff,  some with a ‘bad-gal’ attitude, when you try to complain you will get shut down  immediately...
I paid £297 for a room in this hotel which is £297 more than I should ever have paid for this hotel from hell...
‼️ DO NOT WASTE YOUR TIME OR MONEY ON THIS YACHT-HOTEL‼️  
 You will be disappointed, I have read a few good(fake) reviews   Don’t be fooled",1,2021,08,18
119,Could do better!!,"I have tried my best to rate this fairly, but unfortunately a three is the best I can do!
A lovely yacht with a lovely guest room, spoilt by a few staff who are lacking in basic customer service skills!
Rude, non-communicative is not the welcome I expect from any hotel, least not one of this many stars!
Afternoon tea and breakfast were lovely, however, not sure about the lack of of continental options, toast and yoghurts is a poor showing!
Reception staff were allowing some guests to check in early and not others!!
This is not fair to be sat waiting and see others arrive and get their keys straight away!",3,2021,08,18
119,Went for executive room,"So I booked an executive room for our honeymoon a one night stay before flying out from Gatwick. Upon arrival waited at reception to be checked in and this took a while.
Went to the executive room and was very happy.
Great view and very clean.
We tried to call the reception and restaurant to check our time of restaurant booking but no one answered the phone, we called about 10 times from our room.
The food was nice but not worth the £200.
The restaurant was so cold, the air con was freezing.
We then went into the bar and was the same freezing cold. The one night stay with eating in the restaurant came to about £550 and simply not worth the money as the service is really poor.
There was uncollected glasses when we arrived at 3pm outside the rooms and they were still there at 8pm.  Its seem there is lack of staff training and the staff were not that bothered about giving the customer a great experience. The stay reminded us of a very boring airport hotel. There was  no entertainment and its a real shame as this could be a really amazing experience.
I get the feeling people are drawn in by this being a unique experience but the staff really do not live up to the job.
Would never return",1,2021,08,17
119,Awful experience!!!,"Prior to September but was promised a stay and upgrade due to the experience but despite emailing I received one response to say that because I booked through Hotels.com they will not honour the upgrade aside from the fact that they didn’t specify through whom to book. Appalling customer service!!!!

I stayed at the what was envisaged to be the luxurious Sunborn Yacht Hotel which on the face of it appeared all good until we arrived at our room.  We found one of a family of beetles and a dirty shower, not what you would expect!

My emails have since just simply been ignored, aside from one telling me that they were not going to honour their promised upgrade,so rest assured if you have a problem they will simply ignore you.

Absolutely terrible experience!!!!",1,2021,08,17
119,Amazing experience,"My daughter and I were really impressed with the opulence and the cleanliness of the Sunborn Yacht Hotel.

We read reviews beforehand and noted those stating the rudeness of the staff. Not true at all.  The staff were amazing, polite, helpful and went out of their way to make us comfortable and to answer our questions. In particular we were served by Mario in the dining room and by Gabriel, Kiran and Animesh in the bar. The queue for breakfast was long and in our opinion maybe timeslots could be given. However this did not detract from a totally amazing experience.",5,2021,08,16
119,Novelty stay,"Was an overpriced  novelty really.  
Good location right next to excel centre . Not much else around but a nice big pub 2 mins walk away which was handy and a Starbucks . Handy transport links via custom house dlr station.   Checking in was ok no problem . They take a pre authorised £40 per night on your card for some reason . This was reversed when checking out.  
Room was very nice and clean . ‘River’ view is actually a view of the dock not the actual river (from our level 4 anyway) small balcony with 2 chairs. Aircon didn’t work although noisy air coming out of a vent in the ceiling at all times even if the aircon was switched off. Didn’t seem to be any information in the room about fire escapes etc. Lots of plug sockets in room - half of which are two pin European ones so no use to us. 
The bar prices are expensive and we went to get a drink at bar and was told ‘table service only’ so we were handed a drinks menu but said we would like two pints of draught lager and was abruptly told ‘bottles only’ - no explanation was offered as to why draught wasn’t available. So we sat at a table for 10 minutes and gave up and went elsewhere, where the service was fast and drinks more reasonably priced. 
Breakfast was included in our rate and was very nice full English ‘fry up’. Staff at breakfast were polite and explained how it works. Expensive if it wasn’t included in your room rate. 
The lifts seemed to have a mind of their own and often displayed the wrong floor level number! One couple told us they’d been going up and down in the lift for 10 minutes ! 
The lavazza coffee machine in the room didn’t provide authentic lavazza pods but plain generic pods so I didn’t use it . 
As I’ve seen other people mention , it wouldn’t hurt them to provide complimentary water in the rooms , considering the price .  Don’t think we will return but was ok for a one off experience.",3,2021,08,15
119,Poor customer service and no response to formal complaint,"On arrival, one of the lifts were out of use, with only one other guest lift in use, being used between all decks.  This resulted in us all, including a 10 week old baby in a pram and a 3 year old, waiting outside for nearly 20 minutes before we could get in to the lift.  This instantly caused distress, especially with a very impatient 3 year old, as you can imagine.  I have to say, I visited the yacht a few weeks ago and noticed that the lift was out of use then, so the lift has certainly been out of use for some time. A member of staff confirmed that it had been out of use for over a month now.

Following on from this, as part of our booking, I had paid extra for the romantic package as we were away celebrating our 10th Wedding Anniversary, which advertises it self as, and I quote,
‘Personally prepared by our team - Swans on bed accompaigned by rose petals and plate of chocolates to create a lasting memory for that special loved one..’
Well, to find artificial rose petals and four tiny chocolates on quite a big plate was some what disappointing.  Not something you expect for £45.00. NOTE - at checkout this package was refunded. 

That evening when setting up the children’s beds, travel cot and monitors / music etc.  We noticed that we only had a selection of three UK plug sockets, to which only two worked as the bedside socket was loose and sparking and only worked when you held the plug in tightly.  I have to ask, why a UK hotel has more European sockets that UK? This resulted in us popping out to purchase some European sockets.  We also noted that the tablet computer within our room didn’t work. According to reception most of them don’t, so why is this advertised within the room details? 

When getting into bed, we quickly noticed how uncomfortable the bed was, being two beds joined together and not the ‘luxurious king-sized bed advertised.’ I have to say, I have stayed in more comfortable Premier Inn beds. 

On our first morning, we headed to breakfast, to find ourself facing another challenge with the single lift in use.  With a pram, we ended going up and down about four times, before someone decided to tell us that you needed the keycard to get to level 4. We were never told this, and there is no sign within the lift explaining this, causing unnecessary anxiety within the family. 

At breakfast, we were told that there were no cereals, no pastries and no fruit selection.  With only a cooked full English breakfast, vegetarian breakfast, avocado on toast or pancakes, with yogurts on the side to choose from. This was very disappointing, especially with children as part of our group. It took for us to complain and create a fuss to be offered cereal and fruit.  We had to do this all three mornings. 

This was the last straw, we had only be onboard for less than 24 hours and were very upset and disappointed, especially as this was supposed to be a really special trip to celebrate our 10th wedding anniversary, and out first trip away as a family of four following the arrival of our baby.  We went and raised all of our issues above to a lady called Wyn on the front desk, whom turned round and said, and I quote, “sorry about that, I see you’re here for two more days, let’s hope they are better than the first”.  Utterly disgusting, especially when we found out Wyn is actually the FOH Manager. 

It wasn’t a surprise to hear throughout our stay other guests complaining about various issues too.  For a hotel advertising itself as executive and luxurious, it certainly wasn’t that, in both the quality of the services provided and the customer service. 

Overall, we are very upset that our special occasion wasn’t so special and our experience of our stay with you affected the whole trip.  To the extent that we feel we need to go away somewhere else to celebrate again.  We begrudge paying the amount that we did for what we actually received and experienced, and hope this is something you will consider as part of the resolution to this complaint. 

NOTE - This review is relating to the our personal experience.  I will be leaving a more positive review relating to the Yacht, Rooms, Location, Value etc. We're just frustrated that our points raised above have not been responded to following our complaint.",2,2021,08,15
119,LOVE LOVE LOVE this hotel,"LOVE this hotel,this was the 4th time that me and my husband had stayed  the staff are so friendly and welcoming, the lovely man at the front desk (sorry didn't get his name)but he see we had stayed before and gave us a lovely complimentary upgrade!the rooms are spotlessly clean as is the hotel and we had a great comfortable stay.the breakfast I can't fault(even though we had to queue for a table)but the breakfast was so delicious it made up for it! I definitely would recommend to any couple, and we will definitely will be going back again! Thank you Sunborn 😊",5,2021,08,13
119,Amazing Stay and treated like royalty!,"I was very fortunate to win this wonderful prize of a stay in an executive suite, dinner and breakfast for 2 people  via the Sunborn London facebook page   From the moment we checked in we were treated as special guests and we had such a wonderful time, as did our friends who also stayed with us.   

We chose to stay in July and we were so lucky to have exceptional weather which meant that we could use the very large deck that came with our room.  Overlooking the Thames with a wonderful view of the sites in London was just spectacular.  .  The actual room we stayed in was amazing and the bathroom had your own personal sauna (which unfortunately we did not get chance to use) two showers, and a lovely Jacuzzi bath.  

As the weather was so beautiful we were seated outside on the deck for dinner, which again had stunning views once the sun went down and the lights of London lit up the skyline..  The food and service we received was amazing and we could not fault any of it.  In fact we stayed on the deck all evening and did not leave until after 11 (and that was only because the restaurant had closed and they have to clean it all)  

We were so pleased that our friends decided to join us and stay over to enjoy the experience.  They were also treated to an upgraded room upon check in which was an added bonus for them.  

This was our second stay on the Sunborn Yacht and I must say that we loved every minute of it.  We would certainly recommend and if you ever get chance of booking one of their Executive Suite Rooms for a special occasion I would definitely recommend.  

We didnt really get the chance to say thank you to all the staff during our visit so please pass our thanks  to all the staff as they really made our stay such a special one.",5,2021,08,12
119,"All that glitters is not gold: Appalling customer service, Disappointing hotel and shocking insect problem!!!","Note: Staff member, Samir, is both rude and incomprehensibly unprofessional. He requires immediate customer service training. Avoid bringing any concerns or complaints to him.

We booked to stay on 2nd August for 1 night. First room smelt like a sewage so Leonardo (receptionist) kindly moved us to a new room. It was clean. However, it was freezing and the thermostat did not work. We waited 30 mins and no heat circulated. We reported this to reception and advised that it was so cold we had to leave and would get something to eat. The receptionist said she would get maintenance to sort it. We came back 1.5hrs later, but nothing had been done. Leonardo apologised for not doing it whilst we were out, and moved us to a 3rd room as he could not get heating to work. Lovely room, but we were swamped with flies coming out the A.C unit. We spent about 15 minutes killing and ducking flies before filming it and going back to Leonardo. He moved us to a 4th room, which unfortunately again was swamped with flies, which he also saw. He moved is a 5th time to another room on another level as it was clear something had died in the air venting system that was causing the smell and flies. He checked the room pulled the curtains back and out dropped a nest of spiders. He was soo embarrassed he simply asked if he could call an alternative hotel.  He made a full report which he advised would be given to the manger the next day. We checked in at 4.30pm and spent the evening moving from room to room. Ruining our evening. And then at 11.30pm had to go to an alternative hotel.

 We had to pay to travel to another hotel, and to had to pay to stay at anothe hotel. To date we have not heard anything back from the Sunbourn Hotel. Not even an apology. I called today (12/08/21), and had the unfortunate experience of speaking with Samir, who simply demonstareted no care or concern for our deplorable expeirience and began to tell me that I was not a guest as I did not stay there.I am unsure who would sleep alongside flies coming out of an air vent. I am unsure how this hotel has remained unchecked after reading the reviews I have now seen.

As shocking disgrace for the hotel industry.

I was unable to include the video I could only take screenshots.",1,2021,08,12
119,Good but let down by poor maintenance.,"My wife and I booked one night in one of the huge suites on deck four at the front with a wrap around balcony you could hold a party for 60 on! Lovely suite with loads of storage and all spotless too. However we found that the rooms were cold and the huge bathroom in particular was freezing with no way of heating it up! The air con/heating worked fine in the bedroom but not in the lounge which remained cold for our stay. There is a sauna in the bathroom which we could have used to heat it but it was not working unfortunately. The other problem we had was with flies, luckily as we travel abroad a lot we had some fly spray with us but as fast as we killed them more appeared??!! Maybe from the air vents which seem to pump cold air in 24/7. We didn't complain until checking out as we did not want repairs going on for the very short time we were there. Reception did note our concerns however and said the issues would be looked at. No use to us of course but our choice. We ordered room service for breakfast which came on time and was good and included in our package. All in all a lovely suite with amazing views but everything should be working properly for a suite costing around £450 a night!",3,2021,08,12
119,amazing stay,"We have just spent one night aboard the Sunborn for our wedding anniversary, check in was smooth and quick and when we got to our room we were amazed not only did we have a spacious cabin but an extra room attached with a wrap around balcony which spanned the entire front of the ship. Had a complementary glass of wine on the balcony was amazing. Drinks in the bar and breakfast in the morning were equally amazing.",5,2021,08,10
119,Freezing Cold Room! Phone & Coffee machine both not working either!,"Stayed at the Sunborn Yacht London on 2/8 for a birthday/anniversary  surprise in room 1046. Really looking forward to it as I had stayed there before, however what a very disappointing stay this was.  

I have e-mailed regarding my concerns but to date only reply has been it will be passed onto the relevant Manager that was over a week ago? I have telephoned this morning and still waiting for a “ Manager” to contact me! 

They are happy to take my money, oh and by the way apparently I only paid “small amount of money so can not refund anything” as said by Sami, assistant Manager on duty  at 6:45 am on the 3/8 but not so forth coming to deal with this Complaint!

119,Weekend getaway,"Beautiful hotel both inside and out the rooms are a great size and beds very comfortable the river view is beautiful to wake up too staff were amazing and friendly both upon arrival and at checkout the following morning. Unfortunately one of the lifts was out of service so this made a small wait and was quicker to take the stairs which can be frustrating when you have luggage the rooms have a small fridge,coffee machine,iron and board,kettle and of course your morning tea or coffee included, the bathroom was of average size with a strong shower which is great overall a wonderful stay at the Sunborn.",4,2021,08,09
119,Average  hotel -expensive eating on board,Me and wife stayed for one night dinner (not part of the package) and breakfast (part of the package) as a gift for our wedding anniversary. Staff were friendly and location was fine if you needed to go sightseeing nearby and into Central London. Local supermarket shops and restaurants not far away walking distance. Ordered starters/main/dessert(3 course meal menu-pricing on menu were not clear for each item).Food was served in time (pre booked time/table) and food  and breakfast was well presented.,3,2021,08,08
119,Disappointing stay,Me and my partner traveled to London from Liverpool for my partner’s 50th birthday to stay on the Sunborn yacht hotel the stay was very disappointing I had booked a birthday package for £25 which was supposed to have had a message left in the room to greet my parent from me to her but only thing there was 3 helium balloons and a £1 happy birthday banner very disappointing as we we’re putting are clothes away we had to spend 10mins killing fly’s then to top this all off we were about to make a cup of tea and coffee and to are surprise the cup’s we’re not clean neither was the cutlery the rooms are very dated we then went to the bar for a drink and as we decided what to have to drink we were hounded by a member of the bar staff to buy drinks what a surprise the next morning we were getting ready to leave not before having are breakfast so we we’re tucking into are breakfast when I found a hair in my breakfast so I told the member of staff about this and they did not apologize to me at all they just said do I want a fresh breakfast I wouldn’t advise anyone to stay on this yacht hotel  very disappointing.,2,2021,08,08
119,Average,"Me and my wife stayed here of one night and I have to say I found it a bit disappointing, they advertise it as a super yacht but to be honest it felt more like a car ferry. On the positive side it’s in a good location with great views of the city, parking is close by, we parked in the royal Victoria, it was £20 for 24 hours which is ok and it’s only a short walk to the boat. We were expecting a boat like the TV show “below deck” but as I said it felt very ordinary. Our room was large and clean but nothing special, we went for a drink in the bar first again not as luxurious as we were expecting, it had a lovely deck out the back with a view of the city which would have been nice but the weather wasn’t great so we had to sit inside, they didn’t have anything put out so you could go outside and it dry and warm to have a drink. We had dinner there that night, again the restaurant was just ok but the food was very good, expensive but good quality and only for this I would given it a rating of 2 …. So to finish it didn’t have that luxury feel but was still unique experience.",3,2021,08,06
119,Disappointing for a 4-star hotel,"The staff were brilliant—very friendly. And the room was clean. The breakfast was very good. The view across the dock is lovely.

The hotel is… adequate. Disappointing considering its 4-star status.

Main gripes: shoddy electrics in the room, plug sockets that don’t fit properly. The wifi is AWFUL. Central London in 2021 and I can’t even have a Zoom call? And little phone signal? Nope.

And the phone in our room doesn’t work, either.

So: no complaints about the staff or cleanliness, they’re brilliant. Thank you staff!

The hotel as a whole though, fittings and services—super disappointing, especially considering it’s quite pricey.",3,2021,08,06
119,Ladies weekend,"From the moment we walked on to the Yatch we were treated very well.

Rooms were excellent - River View 

Evening meal - well cooked and delicious.  Service was very good and didn't have to wait long to serve 6 hungry ladies 😊
Lunch - another experience- brilliant service.

One of the staff from the restaurant we name... Sugar crumbs' ... she was polite, courteous and amazing 

Sarah at the reception desk was so welcoming and professional for the whole time we were there. Also the rest of staff.
 Thank you Sunborn London for making our Birthdays weekend a memorable one.

Will be back!

119,Shocking service,"The room was lovely and so was our daughters who was there with her husband and 2 children, we had dinner on our first night and it was lovely and service was good, breakfast was nice on first day but second day was just a joke we waited over and hour and people that had came in after us got there food before our order had even been taken, then when it did come some of the part had left as they had waited long enough , we told the waitress who told the floor manger who totally did nothing not even to come over to ask what was wrong, the second time same again we had to call them over to give them our order and then after 40 min still no breakfast, it seems that if u are paying for the food in the restaurant they are ok but when it is included in the price they really don’t care and we reported this to reception and they did not want to know, we won’t be coming back again",3,2021,08,05
119,A little out the way but nice all the same,"We stayed here as a gift bought for us.  The hotel is quite close to City airport though not on the same DLR line.  The location of course means that the DLR becomes your friend to get into central London, reckon on about 40 minutes DLR plus tube, a bit longer if you take the bus from Tower Gateway.

We had booked a ""dockside"" (I think that is what it was called room which was changed to a riverside room when we checked in.  Nice views across the water, the room was really quite big with a sofa, very large bed, coffee machine etc.  We found the room very quiet, little outside noise from the corridor, and temperature easy to control with air conditioning (this was early June, around 25 C outside).  

The breakfast service I think was not typical of the hotel because of Covid-19 so by the time you read this things may have changed.  Essentially hot food was cooked to order with cereals etc selected from a buffet.  The full breakfast was really quite substantial.  

Would we return? Probably not, but only because the location makes it inconvenient for central London.  However, if you've business in the area then it's well worth considering.",4,2021,08,04
119,30 Year Anniversary,"We booked the Romantic Package for our Anniversary. Debiting our card £40 pound, a requirement at check in as a 'damage charge' that is refunded 5 to 10 workings day after your checkout was not expected and not necessary. Most hotels now hold card details but generally do not debit money, we were told £100 pounds if we paid via cash. We had four chocolates, which was our tray of chocolates (a little stingy) and the bed was beautifully decorated with flower petals and towel swans.  No complimentary WATER in room. Had an iron, iron board, hair dryer and other toiletries are provided. Very clean. Only one lift working, reception very busy during check in. Staff are very friendly. Three course meal was lovely in Lands End Restaurant,  no water view. (There were supplements though not highlighted so check when you order, in our case the steak and the steak sauce etc) Bar was not luxury, slow service and too expensive. No access to deck either due to rain. We wanted to spend our time on the yacht and experience all it had to offer and we did however the bar bill with 12.5 % service charge was on par with our 3 course meal. Probably best have drinks locally. Check out is at 11am we opted for breakfast in our room, (additional 5 Pound charge) delivered on time with everything we needed and ordered, Full English, we definitely recommend. Overall a good experience but unfortunately, we wouldn't stay again.  

P.S Parking is £20 pounds for a 24 hour stay in the local car park at the Excel Centre.",4,2021,08,03
119,Disappointing experience,"My partner and I stayed here as part of our trip to London for his 30th birthday. The hotel is out of the way but as it’s a yacht we thought it would be a unique experience and well worth it. Unfortunately we were left disappointed with our stay. For context we stayed on July 18th and the temperature outside was 30+ degrees.
We arrived early to the hotel and had a pleasant wait and drink in the bar area before getting our room keys at about 3pm. We entered our room and instantly felt the heat, the thermostat currently said 26.5 degrees. A member of staff knocked on our door to see if we were okay and we asked for help with the air conditioning. They helped and we were advised to wait about fifteen minutes for it to kick in.
We ordered room service in anticipation of this but the temperature didn’t lower. We opted to have our drinks in the hallway as it was so much cooler and more comfortable. 
We struggled to get ready for his birthday meal and drinks in the heat, we showered but felt hot and sweaty again almost immediately. At around 6pm my partner went to reception to ask for help and they sent down a maintenance staff member. They said that they changed the temperature from the mains and to ignore the thermostat reading, which was now 29.5 degrees. We left shortly after for food and were content that we would come back to a cool room.
Fast forward to 11pm when we got back and the room was still an oven. We knew that we would not have slept comfortably in the room, if at all. My partner went to reception, our third interaction with staff regarding the air conditioning, to ask for help again. The receptionist came down and agreed it was too hot in there, with a thermostat reading of 29 degrees. The receptionist found us another room for which we were really grateful, but we were packing our bags and moving at almost 11:30pm.
I feel really disappointed with our stay and it has definitely tainted my partners 30th birthday memories. The hotel was lovely but we didn’t get to appreciate our room, and it is not a cheap stay either. It’s frustrating that it took three separate occasions of seeking help with the air conditioning for something to finally be done, but it was practically the middle of the night. 
I have contacted the hotel via email on July 21st and I am yet to have a reply which adds to the sadness we feel from the stay. A simple apology for our trouble and not being able to fully appreciate this unique experience would suffice. However it very much feels like now they have our money and we’ve left they don’t care. 
I wouldn’t come back nor recommend it due to the slow response for help. I hope no one else has this kind of trouble for their stay.",3,2021,08,03
119,Average at best,"Communal areas look impressive, beyond this it is an overpriced disappointment.
Check in painfully slow,3 pm check in and initially just 2 staff on at 3:30pm
One of Two lifts out
No formal signage, hand made taky signage on a mount from banner stationery supplies
Decor very tired and dated
Fake lavazza coffee pods in room, no complimentary water... Happy to charge £3.50 for a 330ml bottle though
No room service available at all on Mondays and Tuesdays or after 9.30pm the rest of the week
Breakfast cooked to order, but choice very limited, no continental options at all
Coffee was awful, typical cheap hotel bitter mud!
Would not recommend or stay again",3,2021,08,02
119,Hotel on board Yacht,"Stayed for one night on this very nice yacht. Clearly an older retired small cruise ship but well maintained and very clean. Friendly staff. Paid £20 extra for outside cabin with small balcony. Very spacious room. Bathroom is compact , as you would expect but excellent power shower. Breakfast was good, although very busy with people queueing. Overall very good with nice location in quiet dock.",4,2021,08,01
119,Cool looking yacht but staffing is unacceptable for 4*,"Situated in a lovely area only a short walk from the DLR so great for commuting into central London. Very impressive when arriving, hotel lobby was beautiful and very friendly staff at reception. Told them it was our honeymoon so congratulated us and ask about our trip. He mentioned that breakfast will be busy the later you go and there are signs around the hotel explaining this even on a weekday. We had a balcony room as we were planning on having a few drinks there of an evening. To our surprise room service was not available on Mondays and Tuesday (the two nights we were staying). We decided to go down to the bar for a drink instead. The sky bar on our level was closed. Which we thought was odd. Heading down to the bar we noticed there was a few tables occupied but not busy. But only two people working. One serving and the other making the drinks. We had to wait to get a menu and again for taking our order. Looking around other people for fed up of waiting and went straight to the bar to order and got served with drinks before us. We understand this wasn’t the service issue but being understaffed. We only had one drink and a little bite to eat before heading up. Our shower was broken and constantly throwing out boiling hot water. Phoned down to reception and they were there within minutes to check it and sort us out with a new room, two doors down. 
In the morning we woke up late after not having our toddler with us and enjoyed not being woke up between 5-6am. So went down for breakfast at 9.20, greeted with a large queue that took 30mins to seat us. Wrote down our order and had to ask someone to take that as no one was acknowledging it. It wasn’t until 10.50, a lovely young waitress saw that most people had been served before us, came and asked for our room number and apologised for the wait. We noticed this same woman was the only attentive one to other guests. Other guests were moaning about the wait and also wrong food orders. We finally got our breakfast which was lovely, but wasn’t worth the 2hour wait for. Luckily we didn’t have much planned for that day, but it did eat up precious time of our trip. We decided the next morning we would get up and go straight down. We were there just after 8am and no queue or waiting. We had been seated and ate our breakfast within 30mins. The breakfast also had two sausages and two bacon, we only had one of each the day before. If it wasn’t included in our stay it would have been annoying to pay the £16.50 each. Such a big difference to our morning. 

Overall nice place to stay but not at the beginning of the week as they don’t have the staff to cope with the amount of guests. Definitely wasn’t 4* hotel we had hoped for.",3,2021,07,31
119,"Great hotel, poor breakfast.","I made a reservation through a Groupon deal for a room for 2 with breakfast included with view to the dock. However, we changed our minds and we accepted an upgrade paying £40 more.

The hotel is very well located, close to the Excel Exhibition Centre and the DLR. The concept of being a guest in a yatch hotel is very cool. As soon as you arrive you can feel the luxurious ambience. We felt on holidays even when we were just having a break in London.

The receptionist, Leonardo, was super kind and professional with us. He explained to us the whole procedure and the services. They take a £40 preauthorisation on your card upon check-in to guarantee the room against damages. 

The hotel is amazing, clean, super glamorous; it is like being on a cruise ship. The rooms are very spacious, the bed is just amazing (I slept and I relaxed so much! Just what I needed after weeks of lots of stress and work). The balcony and the views are amazing (just an advice, try to change the lock because you can lock yourself out if you close the door when you are at the balcony). They leave a kettle and a coffee machine with capsules and teas in the room. It has a minibar (amazing!), so you can bring your own drinks. Robes and slippers provided. Safety box in the room. Big closet with hangers, iron and ironing board. 

The restaurant is quite expensive so we didn't have dinner there. Drinks are at an expectable price for a hotel of this category.  It was very nice to have a drink looking at the river and the skyline. So relaxing! 

My only complain is the breakfast. Considering the type of hotel and the price we paid for a room, we expected a buffet or another type of breakfast. We went for breakfast very early, tike at 7:30, because we knew that it could be busy later on. Still we had to wait just for a plate of pancakes and an English breakfast. If you have it included you can only choose one item from a list of 5 options, and every extras you have to pay it separately (very expensive though). It tasted ok but it wasn't gourmet or anything special. Unlimited hot beverages, water and yoghurt but still, very poor for the money we paid for a room. Reading the reviews I see is a recurrent complain from guests, so I would consider a change, specially having just across the street a hotel like Novotel with an amazing all-you-can-eat buffet breakfast.

Apart from that, an amazing experience! We want to come back, hope soon! We really enjoyed it! I came super stressed and tired, and with just one day there I feel super relaxed and happy! Thank you so much!",4,2021,07,29
119,Terrible breakfast service,"Booked this hotel as a surprise night away for my daughters birthday. I had pre-arranged and paid for balloons, banners and a cake in the room. Which was done but felt a little ""cheap"" considering it cost £45 extra. The boat and room itself was impressive and we was very happy with it, apart from the bedding felt slightly damp but I think that was due to air-conditioning.
As we checked in we was advised to avoid going for breakfast between 9-10 am as this was their busy period. So we went for 10am. We waited 10 minutes to be seated while all around us we could hear complaints of people waiting long periods of time for their food. 
We ordered our food and had a look at what continental was available.... Nothing apart from yoghurt!!!! Not a single piece of fruit, cereal or pastries. It had got to 10.50am and we still hadn't received our breakfast so I went to reception and advised them I couldn't check out at 11am as we had been waiting for breakfast and hadn't finished packing up. They was nice enough about it and said not to worry to eat and then pack and leave.
Finally got our breakfast 1 hour and 10 minutes after we had ordered it. Now it was OK. Not very hot which made me wonder why we had waited so so long?? It was tasty enough but definitely not worth the wait. I must say the breakfast waitresses was run off their feet and trying to do the best they could despite all the complaints. I'm sure they don't get paid enough to deal with all that. 

Please for the sake of your waiting staff and guests get new breakfast chefs who can handle all the orders or don't sell that many breakfasts it's not fair on either.

I would stay again but definitely not pay and have breakfast.",3,2021,07,29
119,Let down by diabolical breakfast system,"We stayed here when visiting London. 

The boat is impressive. The room was very large, much bigger than I had expected. View of thames. Nice comfortable bed.

Drinks in bar were very expensive. At breakfast there was a 30 minute queue for a table. Very badly organised. Looked very understaffed. Mentioned my disappointment in having to miss breakfast due to the long wait and all the receptionist did was laugh.

There is a car park near by where you can park for £20 per day. Close to DLR.  About £20 in an uber to West end from there.

Overall was a very fun experience.",4,2021,07,25
119,Disappointed,"I am very disappointed in our stay. I was expecting a luxury experience. Firstly when we arrived we noticed all the guests not wearing a face mask,it's understandable as it's not a legal requirement. However we've been told of by receptionist to wear it, even she was only covering her mouth with her face mask.

The room was basic, no chair in the balcony and there were no water offered in the room.Also we asked to get a table in the restaurant they said it's fully booked. 
She said we could try with restaurant directly,which we did but the waitress she was cold and i told her if we can leave our names in case of any cancellations. She said no no it's fully booked.We ended up having a dinner outside.
Food selection at the bar wasn't great,
the breakfast was included with our stay. It was ok, the choices was limited.

It's not worth for the money what we paid for. I definitely never come back and i wouldn't recommend it to anyone",1,2021,07,25
119,Stunning views,"Me and my fiancé stayed in this hotel for 2 nights in June. It’s in a lovely peaceful location, tucked away so taxis cannot drive right up to it and you have to walk from the road but it only takes around 2-3mins to walk. We arrived a little early and our room wasn’t ready but we was guided to the bar area by the lovely friendly welcoming staff. 

In the bar area there was lots of seating area inside and out. The cocktail menu is incredible and the drinks lovely and strong (slightly pricey but worth it). We also had the burger sharer platter which again was lovely. The service was quite slow, but unfortunately with the covid restrictions this was to be expected.

We paid extra for a river view and it was so worth it. The room was spacious and had a stunning view. My partner also surprised me with the romantic package and we had decoration on the bed with rose petals and delicious chocolates. The room was clean and tidy, shampoo conditioner and soap provided also in the bathroom which smelt gorgeous. The bathroom is quite small but the shower is very powerful.

The room service also very good, we had drinks and food brought to our room on the first night. We was told up to 20min wait but it came within 10. The room service was just taken off of our deposit that we paid when we arrived.

There is lots to do around the hotel, however it’s also a lovely place to just sit and relax on the deck.

The breakfast was lovely, not much to choose from however i always have an English breakfast on holiday and that was on there so I wasn’t complaining. Unlimited tea coffee juice and water during breakfast time.

Overall I would highly recommend this hotel. We have booked to return for my birthday in November.",5,2021,07,22
119,Very disappointed,"We have previously stayed on the Sunborn in Gibraltar and had a fabulous time …. The London one is no where near as good . The boat is shabby and staff are unhelpful . We travelled there on 16th July therefore restrictions were still in place however after arriving at 11:30am we were unable to get a coffee or drink anywhere on the boat . bar did not open until 15:00 and the restaurant midday, for a 4* hotel we all found this baffling . The rooms were ok and comfortable but nothing special . If you are thinking about staying on the Sunborn I would think again for sure …you will be disappointed",2,2021,07,21
119,"Booked the ""Romantic"" package","This had been my Christmas present from hubby and we were looking forward to this, an all too rare night away from home in these all too weird times, and we'd booked for a Monday night too, so we didn't think it would be over busy.

Didn't start off too well, with no indication as to where was the best place to park, other than a generalisation with the booking, of parking at the Excel.  We had a result there though as the parking was reduced from the regular £20 overnight to just £5.  There was also no signage to the actual yacht.  When we did eventually find it, we found a queue of people trying to access one of the two lifts for guests, only to find one was out of action, and the other was being used by workmen as the service lift was also not working, and they were transporting a lot of equipment. 

Anyway, eventually got to Reception, booked in and got to our room, after Reception had taken a £40 holding deposit for damage, to find a bed with a rose petal heart on and a tray of 4 chocolates.  That was it on the ""romance"" stage - there was absolutely nothing in the mini bar, not even bottled water, which is a basic in even the smallest of hotels.  Also no decaffeinated tea or coffee on the hot drinks tray, and no biscuits of any kind either, which I thought was poor.  Again, even in B&Bs you normally find a few sachets of decaffeinated coffee and a couple of little packs of biscuits.

We went and sat up on deck, which was pleasant, watching the planes take off from City Airport and the water based activities by the O2, and had a couple of drinks each and a coffee each.  Not cheap, but a nice afternoon.

As we'd booked a dinner reservation, we headed to the restaurant.  It seemed strange to us that people actually staying on the yacht weren't given priority for the better tables, and that people coming from shore had been given them.  This also applied at breakfast, with lots of breakfast meetings going on.

I have to say that the evening meal was the highlight, beautifully cooked food, well served and with attentive staff.  We thoroughly enjoyed our meals - steak tartare, chicken and strawberries for hubby, mackerel, chicken and strawberries for me.  They even kindly threw in coffees to end the meal.

Peaceful enough night, thankfully with some good air conditioning.  The bed was ""odd"" though, with a strange, thin mattress on top of one of those twin beds put together type of affairs, and a duvet that worked better if you rotated it by 90 degrees.

Breakfast was disappointing.  As already mentioned, there were lots of breakfast visitors and not enough room.  The food was also clearly on a hot buffet in the kitchen and then served up, as it probably normally would be.  Hubby normally loves a cooked breakfast but the egg was hard and the mushrooms inedible.  My Eggs Royale had to be changed to scrambled eggs on toast with smoked salmon, again, disappointing. 

Had to ask for decaffeinated coffee, and weirdly, you had to ask for fresh milk but you could go and help yourself to juice or water, and pots of tea or coffee.  Service was not so good as it had been at dinner.

You have to be out of the rooms at 11, so no real rush.  

Just felt it was a bit disappointing to find those staying on the yacht weren't given a higher priority at meal times.  It would have been easy to open an additional section for breakfast for those attending for breakfast meetings.  It's also a fairly basic expectation to have bottled water in the room.",3,2021,07,20
119,Never again !,"What can I say if I could leave no stars I would no decaf coffee, breakfast a complete and utter disaster! Waited 1 hour and gave up bathroom floor soaked. My first and definitely my last visit. On the plus side the size of the is lovely.",1,2021,07,19
119,Nice weekend away,"Very hard to rate, the hotel is unique and the rooms are lovely. The food is excellent- perfect breakfast and evening meal.
Unfortunately it was let down by two things:
1. The service - Very very slow and took about 40 minutes to get a drink at the sky bar!
2. No access to main bar- Unfortunately they decided not to tell guests that as there was a wedding over the weekend, the main big bar on the 3rd floor was closed off and all guests that’s weren’t in the wedding squad were expelled to the sky bar (a very tiny bar on top level) with two employees with 50+ people to serve!
Overall our experience was good and we would return, however the service needs to improve and they need to tell their guests in advance if they cannot use all of the facilities on the days booked!",3,2021,07,18
119,"Lovely overnight stay, romantic getaway package.","I booked the Sunborn Yacht Hotel for my Husband’s birthday and it was a great choice! 
The staff were professional and efficient from the moment we checked in to the moment we left.
On arrival, we decided to try to get an upgrade to a room with a balcony, and the gentleman checking us in sorted this out for us straight away. 
Because they had already put the rose petals, chocolates and specially folded towels in the room we had booked (part of the romantic getaway package) they let us go and see them and take some pictures. It was a lovely welcome.
It was lovely to sit outside having a glass of wine before our meal, and we really enjoyed the river views. 
The interior of the yacht is quite opulent and luxurious, and we liked our room very much. The bed was very comfortable and there was plenty of space in the room. 
We ate in the restaurant and thoroughly enjoyed the food. Our starter of steak tartare was delicious, and my sea-bass for the main course was beautifully presented and cooked perfectly. 
I would have liked to stay for more than one night, and I think we will go back in the future.",5,2021,07,17
119,"Amazing stay, can’t wait to go again","My boyfriend booked a stay on the yacht for one night for my birthday. This Yacht hotel is absolutely beautiful! Nothing was too much for the staff, the rooms were lovely and the bathroom even had under floor heating! 
We’ve stayed in quite a lot of hotels between us and the bed was one of the comfiest we’ve ever slept in! 
Sunborn would be perfect if you’re going to the Excel arena or the o2. 
We went to watch a show in London and a taxi was roughly £30 to the centre but the yacht was 100% worth the distance. 
There was only one problem with the yacht and that is we didn’t stay long enough! We both definitely want to come back and experience it again!",5,2021,07,12
119,More floating budget hotel than luxury yacht,"I was very disappointed in our stay. I was expecting a luxury experience and instead I found ourselves staying in a room with orange varnished wood inlaid furniture, smoked glass mirrors, a suede sofa that had seen better days and gold fittings that would not have looked out of place in the 80’s so I was shocked to find out not only is the boat only 9 years old but owned by a Swedish company. No Nordic chic in evidence at all and no sign of anything being maintained.  There were no luxury amenities in the room, even water and the bathrobes provided were worse for wear. The pillows were hard. The bathroom was also not great, the shower head was old fashioned and the water came out not of a modern rain head shower head but out of a hose like fitting that pelted out water. There was also no fan in the bathroom which meant it steamed up when the shower was on and  when it cooled down it felt wet and damp. There was very little outside area to enjoy in the public areas and a lot of rubbish in the water by the boat. Breakfast was included in our stay but we only had it on the first day, choosing to go to Starbucks on the second day. The coffee was served out of an urn. The choice was limited, eggs scrambled or fried. We opted for scrabbled and it was obvious they had been made up in a big batch so had gone a bit soggy. All the hot food was not seasoned at all. Our whole stay was very underwhelming and did not match any previous stay we have had in London so we definitely would not stay here again",1,2021,07,11
119,"looks good , but is over rated.","We up graded our room for £100 for 2 nights, the room was very nice but cold , we tried to adjust the thermostat but without any luck.  We asked a member of staff if the room temperature could be increased, he promised it would be . Lies. The only part of the room that was warm was the bathroom . We tried to prop the bathroom door open to warm the room.  Radiator in the room which was closed down. We complained without a result. It was so cold that people were sat in the dining room with outside coats on.  We tried to make phone calls to room service etc . but they never answered . many many times.  Shame it is a nice place run on a shoe string and totally over rated. A nice brake spoiled.",3,2021,07,09
119,Excellent service,"We went here on our first date for afternoon tea. The place is absolutely exceptional. Our waiter was called Mario who was amazing. Checked on us, asked if we had any allergy’s or dietary requirements, he also asked if it was a special occasion and added a little something special to our afternoon tea. What an amazing place and great staff. Thank you Mario for making our date even more special and looking after us cx",5,2021,07,08
119,Worst stay,"It was my birthday and I chose this hotel as I had wanted to stay in before so as its difficult to travel to out of UK at the moment I decided this would be the perfect time to stay in this yatch.
When we arrived we had difficulty in parking our car to unload the luggage as this was not allowed,we rang the reception and they told us that we had to park far from the hotel baring in mind it was raining and we had luggage to carry,we managed to check in and as I had already paid through  secret escapes I was then told to pay a further £40 deposit to secure the room,the staff was so quick in trying to upgrade my room which meant they wanted extra money. The hotel its self its okay the rooms are very basic nothing  exciting there.
The following day I checked out and when I got home I realised I had left my perfumed oil which I bought from Egypt.I called the reception desk they assured me that they would look,they rang me back saying they did not find anything they told me to call back the next day and speak to the main manager which I did her name is Wyn she was very rude and was very dismissive she moreless accused me of calling her staff thieves but the cleaner and the manager were the last people to enter the room I told him were I left the oil.This morning he called and told me they did not find anything that I was responsible for my goods there fore itsy fault that the oil is missing.I have reported this incident to the police.

Please be very careful when choosing this hotel the staff and management lack customer service skills and the attitude is very appauling its actually ruined my experience and I would not recommend this place",1,2021,07,08
119,Very pleasant stay.,"My partner booked this as a late Christmas present (thanks to Covid), in June 2021. We arrived and headed to reception to check in at 3pm- check in was quick and easy and the lady who served us was very helpful. 
The room was clean & spacious, and the bathroom decor & lighting was lovely. The bedroom decor was a little outdated but I assume that’s the vibe of a ship hotel. We ordered drinks to our room while getting ready to go out, which came really quickly. 
We booked dinner and drinks elsewhere, but planned to possibly order room service, due to us having an early dinner, when we arrived back at the hotel. To our disappointment they stopped serving room service at 10. 
Check out time was 11am which was really good- enough time not to rush like some other places. 
The best part- the breakfast was unreal. A full english (included in the price of our room when booking) which was huge and tasty, unlimited hot drinks & juices, and a view of outside. Recommend arriving at 9am or before, otherwise it gets very busy & we were lucky to get the last table outside.

Unsure what the bad reviews about staff are on here, they were all really friendly, informative and attentive.
Overall, we would stay here again & was a lovely weekend away.",4,2021,07,05
119,Love this hotel 😁😁,"We went here for our wedding night, booked into a dock view suite and it was a superb sized room, separate lounge with a sofa and table and TV as you would expect, fridge as well which wasn’t packed with overpriced temptations, which again was great haha

The bathroom/wet room had a good sized shower, which me being 6ft 3” actually allowed me room to stand and use properly 🙌🏻🙌🏻 nice sink and toilet etc, lots of towels and toiletries, which again you would expect for what you pay. 

There was a large wardrobe, dressing gowns, safe, tea and coffee facilities and the Wi-fi was adequate for our needs, the tablet was a nice touch, though not used by ourselves, neither was the desk for anyone on a business stay. 

The bed, was soooooo comfortable, surprisingly so when you first see it, the pillows were for my own taste a tad soft, however I didn’t ask for firmer ones, which I’m sure they would have provided. 

After our meal, we enjoyed a movie and then had a great nights sleep … 

All in all, we loved our overnight stay and with a breakfast in with the price, it wasn’t bad at all for a London stay for two people. 

Would I go again, absolutely and already planning my next visit !!!",5,2021,07,05
119,BEST HOTEL &  BEST 2 NIGHTS OF MY LIFE EVERRRRRRRR,"My goodness, where do I begin? My husband took me to Sunborn for my 30th birthday and my God. It was the most beautiful experience I’ve ever had. The place is absolutely beautiful. We had a beautiful room With a river view and a balcony and it was EVERYTHING. 

My BIGGEST Thank you goes to Sarah Nezam. From when we arrived at the hotel to when we checked out, this lady was an absolute Angel. She basically planned all the surprises i received with my husband. Her work ethics and sense of humour is just incomparable. Honestly I’ve never met a staff that nice.. Sarah was everything and more. I have no words to describe how she made us feel so welcome. THANK YOU Sarah. You deserve the staff of the year award :)

Secondly, all the staffs we came across too was super nice. At breakfast,  the lady that attended to us was very nice and respectful. Her name is Magna. And oh oh oh. Breakfast was LOVELYYYYYYYYYY. 

Martin, at the Bar was super nice too. He even made me my best drink that wasn’t on the menu. (Pina Colander). Staffs during dinner was soo lovely including Hassan. 

Hahah Hassan ended up being our photographer for the night. He didn’t mind at all taking us some lovely pictures  and even took us to the best spots. 

Honestly I will end up with an essay if I continue. All I will say is, THANK YOU SUNBORN for such a beautiful experience I will never forget.. You all shd be proud of your staffs. THEY ARE ALL AMAZINGGGGGGG.",5,2021,07,05
119,Great hotel for special occasion,"Lovely hotel, very clean, staff very welcoming and accommodating. Room great and a good size, river view recommended. Good breakfast in the morning. Restaurant good with great view if outdoors, but pricey for what you get. I would stay again but would eat elsewhere as box now ticked",5,2021,06,28
119,19 year anniversary stay,"We had an AMAZING experience. Felt so safe. Staff were fantastic, polite, friendly, professional and efficient. I have worked and trained   in 5 star hospitality my whole life and  can vouch how amazing the staff have been. Service was fantastic and if you treated them with respect  they went above and beyond for us. I forgot some names but tipped them well. Room was massive bed was so comfortable. Surroundings was beautifull and the breakfast hit the spot.",5,2021,06,27
119,This is no worth the money,"We went for my partners birthday and the prices are not worth what you get. We had a double bed with 

2 single mattress. Also what place takes 40 Incase of any damages they didn't even check the room if there was and refunded the money. I think it's just so they can have money in their account. The only good thing about this stay was the breakfast.

When we was getting ready to leave we had to step over carpet that was being laid they didn't even tell us that it was going on. 

Also government guidelines say table service only yet they still put a service charge of 12.5% that's of the whole price so if your there with a family of 6 that's spending a lot of money there I think that is a joke 

Will not be going back there!!!!!!!!!!!!!",1,2021,06,24
119,Not what was expected,"We arrived late on Friday afternoon to be met and checked in by the receptionist, that was where things started to go wrong, we were charged an £80 deposit which was taken immediately from my account for any damages that may occur………. I’m sorry but I’ve stayed in many a hotel and NEVER been charged and debited a deposit, it made my husband and I feel as if we were untrustworthy, I cannot imagine that this hotel attracts many people that would willingly damage a room, I was then offered an upgrade to a river view for another £80……. Thanks but no thanks.

We had booked an executive room which was spacious with a nice big bed but so unwelcoming, not a luxury in sight, it had a large glass cabinet with a shelf that contained 2 small glasses, tea and coffee facilities were provided but the teabags tasted as if they had been in the room for a long while (ones at breakfast were fine), the fridge was warm and didn’t get colder all weekend, would of been nice to have a bottle of complimentary water in the room and maybe a biscuit, this is not a cheap hotel but came across as tight and money grabbing.

Bathroom was not large but lovely shower, 1 bottle of shampoo and conditioner for 2 guests and a pet hate of mine, no toilet brush. Bin was not emptied during our stay.

There is a tablet in the room for which the main purpose is again to get you to part with your money, no useful information about your surroundings or things you may want to see and do, but you can buy one of the hotels robes for £95……

We decided we would use room service for a late night hot drink, we waited over half an hour for them to turn up, the young lady that delivered it was very pleasant but had no clue on how to use the card reader, (this is by no way her fault but lack of training), once sat down the drinks were cold and the hot chocolate was hot watered down milk……… this was at a charge of £10.13 for 2 hot beverages to which a service charge had been added, needless to say a refund was requested.

Breakfast is of very limited choice, the first day it arrived bland and just about cooked, this mornings was better, well cooked and well seasoned. The young waiter could not find the correct table for the order yesterday going to 3 different couples before returning to the kitchen only to return twice more with the same breakfasts, again lack of training, poor organisation, having worked In hospitality for more than 20 years I do have some knowledge of what to expect.

Even though we purchased this stay on a deal through Secret Escapes I still feel we over paid and it was poor value for money.

There was nothing about this hotel that would make me want to return",2,2021,06,20
119,Great experience,"Hotel Sunborn London deserves nothing less then 10 out of 10.
Absolutely fantastic stay, lovely staff, exceptional 5* service, the most delightful food and the London view is just breathtaking.. 
Everyone who wants to treat someone with the best this is the way to go!!!",5,2021,06,20
119,Rude and unhelpful staff!,"Have a reservation upcoming on monday 21st june, booked via wowcher as it was £40 cheaper. Tried to cancel within 48 hours due to covid symptoms, yet was told they have a 7 day cancellation policiy! 7 days! The booking was made 5 days before the booked date. The member of staff in reservations was totally unhelpful and gave it the typical ""you should have read the small print"". Once asked to be put through to a manager, her attitude and customer service skills were disgusting to say the least. Her response was ""why did you book with us then"". Completely unhelpful, inconsiderate and unprofessional!",1,2021,06,18
119,Fantastic stay on the Sunbourn Yacht Hotel,"Myself & my fella had a fantastic overnight stay
on the Sunborn Yacht this week for his Birthday.
We arrived there early & our room wasn't quite
ready so they took our bags while we went for a
stroll, we had a drink in a nice nearby bar,
weather was absolutely perfect. We went back to
the Yacht & booked in, we had a Riverside room
with balcony, it did not dissapoint, very clean &
roomy. Was just as lovely as we thought & the
view from the balcony was perfect you could see
the royal Victoria Bridge, 02 & canary wharf &
cable cars, lots going on. The Yacht is on the
flight path to city airport so nice to see them
flying over. We went on the Cable cars & then the
uber clipper Catamaran across the Thames. We
got off at Embankment & went fora walk & bite to
eat then reversed the journey. Return on the Uber
& cable cars was a total of £l6pp which was
great. We got back to the Yacht & had a nice
drink on the outside balcony as the sun was
going down. We had a great night's sleep, beds
very comfortable. We went to the onboard
restaurant for breakfast & it was perfect. The
whole overnight break was 10/10. Couldn't fault it
& would Recommend & definitely return again.
Thank you",5,2021,06,17
119,Fantastic,"The Sunborn yacht hotel is a beautiful ship, with a gorgeous interior. The staff were polite and attentive. We started our day with an afternoon tea for two which was lovely (the scones in particular). The rooms are lovely even at the cheapest option and with the romantic getaway package you have a selection tray of four chocolates along with rose petals and towel swans lovingly placed out for you. The bathroom is very elegantly designed and makes good use of its relatively small size. We had an issue with the tv which was solved for us within five minutes. Overall we found the sunborn to be a fantastic choice of hotel and is perfect for a couple’s trip to London.",5,2021,06,17
119,Would not waste your time and money! The staff are rude and when you complain - nothing gets done.,"This hotel needs new staff in every department! My fiance took me away for my birthday to Sunborn. It looks nice in the reception area the, but that's about it. Rooms are slightly outdated. The aircon didn't work in the room and my fiance was up all night due to the room being too hot. We were greeted with a very rude receptionist who wasn't welcoming at all which is sad as it was my birthday trip. We then went and had drinks in the bar which had very slow service considering it wasn't busy at all. I had to get up 3 times to go and order a drink. We then had reservations for their restaurant and my fiance made a special request for my birthday. The food was very nice - the menu is quite pricey and not a lot of options. The problems come with the drinks - please be aware if you order just a ' vodka and coke ' - they actually order you doubles and make you unaware of this. They then have the audacity to say their doubles are classed as singles even though the receipt says doubles - very conning for a ' high classed restaurant ' its also dangerous to serve people doubles when they are unaware. To make matters worse, they done nothing for my birthday. We were treated badly all night by staff. So we then go back to our room and find that our bed is 2 single beds pushed together and 2 separate mattresses! At this point I've had enough. We spent over £400 for this trip and nothing good came out of it. The next morning I went to complain and was immediately told no managers were available please call in - but I had none of it and eventually a manager came and spoke to me. They said give us a week and we will be in touch - its been 3 weeks, I've contacted them 2 times and I have heard nothing back from them. Sunborn - your a joke! You ruined my birthday break. Its not worth your time or money. For a hotel who presents themselves with such class served me with none!",1,2021,06,17
119,Love it!,"The rooms were beautiful and clean. We had a sea view. The service was brilliant when we were at the bar. The only thing for us was the restaurant didn’t have enough options￼ for us. We would definitely go back. It was lovely in the hot sun looking out have our cocktails. 
The reception staff were lovely and welcoming too. Had a fabulous time.",4,2021,06,16
119,"Great views, slow service","The property itself was lovely, with fantastic views. The quality of the food was good but it is let down by the incredibly slow service when ordering drinks, drinks and food. We stayed on a Sunday evening when the hotel wasn't busy and yet had to ask 3 times for drinks on Sunday night and they took 40 minutes before they arrived and people were waiting up to an hour for breakfast on Monday morning. 

The weather was really good when we stayed so it is also unfortunate that the hotel allows non residents to come aboard and use the bar. There is limited outdoor seating on the sun deck adjacent to the bar and on the Sunday afternoon when we stayed this was dominated by a couple of loud groups of non residents, who were playing their own music. It would also be good if some sun umbrellas could be provided to afford some shade.",3,2021,06,14
119,Bad service!,"I stayed one night with a couple of friends. The boat is wow factor from the outside but tired on the inside. It needs a refurb but unfortunately they are making their customers pay for it ! 

We didn’t have long on the boat (maybe a few hours) but when I went to leave the room the door handle came off the door! Which you wouldn’t expect from a 4 star hotel! 

we were late for our dinner reservation so I didn’t have time to report it and when we checked out the next morning I was told I needed to pay £40 for the damage!? 

They had already taken the deposit and refused to send it back. The fact they ask for a deposit suggests to me this is a regular thing.  We were also over-changed for the breakfast and had to argue with the staff to be charged the correct amount when we charged it to the room. Luckily my friend kept the receipt!

I’ve stayed in many hotels and never had this service. 
I wouldn’t stay again.",1,2021,06,14
119,"Rude reception staff, unpleasant stay","My partner and I stayed here, we were harrassed the whole time by numerous members of staff. My partner is exempt from wearing a face covering due to ongoing medical conditions. Following government guidance that states you don’t have to show an exemption card or even justify why you are not wearing a mask, you just have to say ‘I’m exempt’ We were made to feel like second class citizens, humiliated and degraded in front of other guests. 

Our view was initially of concrete so we requested a river view which cost an additional £20. That wasn’t a problem, the problem was the poor service and being made to feel the way we did. The key card didn’t work and rather than getting an apology my partner was grilled on why he wasn’t wearing a mask. 

There was a lovely bar lady/waitress who tried to help and accommodate us the best she could. She was very polite and helpful. The room we got changed to was ok but nothing to shout about for a 5 star hotel.

I think the staff need to do some training on discrimination and equality and know that law rather than be rude to customers who want a break from reality. 

I wouldn’t return or recommend this hotel.",1,2021,06,10
119,Good experience staying on a boat,"We stayed at the Sunborn Yacht Hotel for my girlfriends birthday. I payed £25 for the birthday balloons and banners package which included 3 balloons in the room and 3 banners, therefore this didn't seem worth the money. 

The hotel itself was nice and the experience of staying on a yacht was exciting. The room was large however was a little dated, particularly in the bathroom. No faults can be given in regards to the cleanliness of the room as everything was spotless. 

Breakfast was nice and was waiter service for food, drinks were served on a help yourself basis. The eggs benedict was good however the ham wasn't the best quality and both our breakfasts weren't as hot as they could have been. 

Overall we enjoyed our stay however probably wouldn't return as we have now had the novelty of staying on a yacht. We booked through secret escapes but probably would have been disappointed if we had payed full price.",3,2021,06,05
119,Terrible for the money it costs,"On arrival staff seemed friendly looked very nice
Room was average at best for 274 pounds a night. Once going for drinks in the day was not enough room outside to accommodate guests told it was first come first serve and walked off. It took 30 mins after being sat down inside to be asked what we wanted to drink. Which then took another 40 mins before we actually got these drinks. Wen asked why the wait staff was rude. All in all if I could give it a zero I would for the price u pay its terrible. The night before we stayed at crown plaza which was jus Over 1/3 of cost and million times better the . View the staff and service. Next morning we sat down for breakfast hardly any option any thing other than or more than English breakfast was at a charge even tho it was included and it came out cold and horrible wouldn't give it to my dog ruined anniversary worst hotel I have stayed in!",1,2021,06,04
119,Poor service & attitude,"My husband and I had came for a night away in London. Upon arrival the reception staff were very welcoming.  Our room however, was not what I expected for the money we had spent, the shower couldn't regulate the temperature it was either scolding hot or freezing cold. We had 1 towel for the 2 of us in the room and a coffee maker with no coffee.

When asking if we could have lunch in the bar the waitress was very rude and said it was ""a first come first serve"" bar, there were no tables and we had to wait. When we finally got a table we asked about food and the restaurant, she said that tables needed to be booked and they were full.

I was very upset that this was NOT specified on the website, as we were under the assumption if you come to stay at the hotel there would be reserved tables for guests. However, the waitress who was very abrupt, basically said if you have a problem with it you don't have to stay here!  

I went and spoke with the restaurant team who basically said we are fully booked, and it was booked by people that were NOT guests/staying at the hotel.

So, going back to the bar, the service was extremely poor, on average we waited 30 mins everytime we ordered a drink!  It wasn't just us, other people waited on average 30 minutes and then had wrong orders come out or taken to the wrong tables.  
A manager come out and ask what our order was and if we had been at the table long, by this point we had been there nearly 2 hours and had only had 2 drinks! 
The bar wasn't even busy for the service to be the way it was, very disappointing! 

So, the next morning we had pre-booked breakfast for 2. It states breakfast is between 7-11am. My husband and I arrived at 10:30am to be told AGAIN there were NO tables and there was already a wait with others waiting also.

When asking how long the wait was, the waitress said it could be up to an hour.  I asked if we were guaranteed breakfast as we had already paid and it would potentially be after 11am until we get a table, she shrugged her shoulders and said 
""we suggest people come earlier as its a busy time"" and walked away. 

Overall, I would NOT recommend staying here, staff are rude, service was very poor and they cater more for the clients NOT staying at the hotel than the guests that have paid to be there who are not be able to enjoy the facilities / boat deck / restaurant etc, that you have undoubtedly paid for!",1,2021,06,01
119,Poor service,"I came in for dinner,  I had order ahead of time but my meal came in late, waiting 20 minute for my main. The waitress wearing the white shuffle blouse was very rude and I saw this against an Asian lady, who was ordering food. I was so upset that I didn’t even enjoy my meal.    The rest of the team were very nice.  As a foodie, service is very important, no matter how your food taste or looks like. I will not be coming here again",1,2021,05,30
119,One night B&B break,"Like many others (probably on the same Groupon deal) recently had a one night B&B break at the Sunborn Yacht Hotel.
We had no complaints.
Room was very spacious, well equipped and very quiet. Lucky to have a view overlooking the water.
Breakfast the following morning was excellent. It was busy and we had to queue for a short while, but we expected this as we had taken notice of the warning signs posted around the hotel.
The staff were very attentive and polite.
Would return and would recommend to others.",5,2021,05,27
119,First Family Trip As a Family,"I stayed at the Sunborn Yacht Hotel. Had an amazing time and was mostly down to the staff - Especially Sami the receptionist. First time away with my 3 month old son, he made us welcoming, we were able to park using the blue badge and made sure we had a comfortable room for all 3 of us. It really made our great trip as a family a great one - especially with the current restrictions! Thank you ",5,2021,05,23
119,Very disappointing ,"We were so looking forward to our stay as we had stayed on the Sunborn in Gibraltar , that we loved, and expected the equivalent sadly that was not the case. Staff were abrupt verging on rude. We were surprised that no drinking water was provided in the room. Room size is good but a bit dated. Air con didn’t work we asked twice and were told it was rectified IT WASNT. The hotel is in need of some tlc and staff training . Very disappointed .",2,2021,05,22
119,70th Birthday present,"Stayed for one night, had a fabulous time, room was a Classic room, but very large, plenty of storage, lovely comfortable bed. Food was lovely, the price you would expect to pay in London in a 4 star! Drinks the same.The views at night of Canary wharf and the Emirates cable cars was stunning! All the staff were polite and helpful, would highly recommend!",5,2021,05,20
119,In need of help,"Hi the boat is great the rooms are super size well{ equipped Verry clean & tidy
I've been on cruise ships not As large

Cleaners great

Only gripe no cover or heating on the rear deck
I'm a where that there was no eating or drinking due to covid but it could have been sorted a bit better when it's raining

The front of house & restaurant staff need to be retrained not Verry good

Enough moaning u just need to make the most of it
I hope if we went back it will have improved😇",3,2021,05,19
119,Scam. Avoid at all costs,I had booked to stay here. I then had to change the date of my stay due to covid. They changed it to the wrong date and then marked me as a no show and refused to refund. Absolute scam artists. Avoid.,1,2021,03,09
119,Anniversary stay,"Booked direct with the hotel . Unless you have a blue badge you have to park down the road.  They hadn’t gone overboard with the Christmas decorations so wasn’t very atmospheric! We had an executive room with a river view and balcony . The room was large with tea and coffee but no bottled water. There was a constant noise from the A/C which made it difficult to sleep , bed ok large and quite comfortable. I had to ask for robes as none had been provided, when they came they were big enough for a small child ! So waste of time asking. We had a meal in the restaurant which is quite expensive ascare the drinks but the steak we had was very nice . The mirrors in the restaurant could have done with a clean but apart from that it was fine. Overall it was a nice stay very different would be fabulous in the summer but due to Covid we had to have breakfast in our room which was nicely presented but freezing cold. Very expensive for what it is rooms a bit , tired iron burn in the carpet if your professing to be 5star then you have to make it happen .",3,2020,12,16
119,Lovely Room,"Unique stay and the rooms are lovely. Parking is really expensive nearby and the customer service wasn’t quite as expected for a luxury hotel. However, the executive suite with river view is gorgeous! Lovely and comfortable. The bar area is also really gorgeous. Wouldn’t recommend the restaurant but would 100% stay at the hotel again, you will definitely enjoy and feel luxurious.",4,2020,12,15
119,Very nice  experience,"Booked this an an early Xmas pressie for the missus. Lovely room, sumptuous experience. Good experience at reception and the room was very nice. Some have said the bathrooms are small but our 's was spacious, for a yacht and the shower was very good. 

A couple of niggly points. Booked directly as a member to benefit from the updates, but weren't given any when we booked in and they were far from full capacity, so disappointed we weren't offered an upgrade. The breakfast was okay, but certainly not worth £17 a head. We tried to have a drink at the bar but under the current covid regs, we would have had to buy two deserts at least, which would have added at least £18 to our round of drinks and we had just had a full meal at the Chinese restaurant over the road.",4,2020,12,14
119,Well that is a dock land view...disappointed.,"Although the room was large, we could not change the temperature, it was extremely hot in the room and the underfloor heating in the bathroom was so excessive it actually hurt my feet. Due to our room being so close to the gang way we were woken up at 0430hrs and 0600hrs by people boarding the boat. Really disappointed visit! Not worth the money.",3,2020,12,14
119,Lovely experience and sent back list property free of charge,"Lovely place and customer service was amazing. The rooms are HUGE! I happened to leave my Galaxy buds there (typical) and contacted customer service. They located them very promptly and posted them out to me free of charge.

Lovely people, highly recommended for sure. 

Completely different experience than your usual stay.",5,2020,12,12
119,Nice hotel,"I stayed here with the family last year - partner and 2 children, to see the sites of london and the room was great value ( i booked through booking.com ), the room was very spacious and clean, the staff were polite and courteous. The only bad things i would say is the bar is quite expensive and if you are driving down there isn’t a great deal of places to park close by. Overall though, its querky and a nice place to stay",4,2020,11,24
119,Mr,"10/10

Great service! Great breakfast! Very impressed all round especially under the current circumstances!

I’m not one to usually go out my way to give reviews but credit where credit is due!

Thank you",5,2020,11,14
119,Outstanding Staff / Service,"The property is beautiful and so different from being in a conventional hotel. 
The service, courtesy, kindness and attention of the staff members we dealt with was second to none.
Although everyone was lovely and attentive to our needs and beyond, there were two people, Leonardo and Damian, that work diligently from the time of the booking until we checked out. Thank you we will return soon” K Hasemore",5,2020,11,11
119,Shocking customer service ,"Made a complaint to the hotel on Sunday evening 
And not one member of the management team can reply to a customer by phone or by email 
A repeat customer who has stayed before Ann’s also brought custom to the property .

Shocking customer service no management and leadership and other hotels like the crowns plaza is leading ahead . 
Avoid this hotel at all costs 
No customer service they don’t care 
They have a poor attitude maybe after 4 weeks being closed again and when you re open remember you need customers and guests but you can’t look after them 
Shocking and poor very poor service in the food and beverage department 
",1,2020,11,04
119,Don’t expect too much,"I booked this hotel for my partners 30th birthday expecting it to be amazing. Sadly I was disappointed. 
From the outside it looks great and even when you step inside. As we entered our room we discovered there was no fresh air, no windows we could open but we had air con. Unfortunately this didn’t work and just blew out hot air. I rang down to reception and they did move us to another room. But yet again the air con didn’t work. If you are someone that becomes hot easily it’s not for you. It made our stay very uncomfortable. The lift situation is also bad. There are only two and you have to wait for a very long time. One occasion we came back to our room to find out our key card no loner worked so we had to sort that also. Customer service wasn’t the best. Also when I arrived I had to pay over £100 security deposit which I was unaware of before I booked. This should be refunded to me in the next few days hopefully. I expected a lot more from this hotel but sadly it just didn’t match expectations. It is well located but I wouldn’t return.",3,2020,11,03
119,Glad we went but slightly chaotic.,What an amazing hotel. The amazing look of the yacht before you get on board should be enough to impress anyone. We had an executive room which was lovely. At times the service is amazing like bringing us coffee in our room because our coffee machine was not working. That said the chaotic breakfast was annoying and check in was too complicated and it seemed so many mistakes. That said the breakfast in the trays was first class and the bar service faultless. I will come back in happier times and let’s see if the errors are sorted I really hope so. ,4,2020,11,03
119,Don't Stay Here,"This hotel is an over priced joke.  Don't stay.  Staff not interested and no customer service at all.
We had a problem with our room, restaurant and anything we touched on board.
Not worth the stress levels staying here!
The worst thing is noone cars!",1,2020,10,31
119,Amazing hotel,"We stayed here for one night and honestly had the best time the hotel is very unique it has a lovely feel to it, the rooms were very spacious and the bed was so comfortable. The bathroom is a little small but suited us as would of wanted a bigger room instead of the bathroom taking up more of the room. The staff were fabulous I would recommend this hotel.",5,2020,10,31
119,Wonderful Birthday Stay!,"My husband and I visited the Sunborn Hotel for a two night stay to celebrate his birthday. 
Firstly I'd like to say ignore all those negative reviews because the staff at Sunborn were so attentive and welcoming. From checking in and throughout our stay we had a wonderful time!
I would highly recommend upgrading your room to a river view, we both enjoyed relaxing on the balcony with a glass of bubbly and appreciating the view.
We dined in the Sundown bar on the first night, Jeremy looked after us and was a delight. On the second night we dined in The Lands End Restaurant and we were looked after by Mario who again was so attentive.
The food was excellent.
We had breakfast twice during our stay and we couldn't fault it, staff at this hotel are really good.
Our time at Sunborn was Wonderful and memorable and I would highly recommend you visit.",5,2020,10,28
119,"Overnight stay, afternoon tea and dinner","Having stayed at many high end establishments, the level of service and quality of food here rivals many. This is a 4 star but the service is on par with a 5.

From the moment we walked in we were treated very warmly and the staff could not do enough for us.

Excellent service from all at afternoon tea.

Jennifer and Mario were fantastic at dinner and hope that they are recognised for their hard work.",5,2020,10,26
119,Our weekend stay wasn’t the best ,"We stayed here a weekend in early October, there’s plenty to do within 30 mins of the area you are pretty close to everything. The reason for our two star is because the hotel is very average nothing special apart from the reception area. Rooms are basic we found the bathroom door very annoying, the bathroom looked like something you see on a train... there was also so much nose coming from out side as we where the dock side therefore we could here all the pipes moving throughout the night. The coffee machine did not work, when arriving for our stay the milk was out of date which we both happened to drink, there was only 3 milk 2 teas and no spoon in our room to stir the tea or the coffee if we was given a machine that worked. We later rang room service then got put though to reception to ask for more milk and tea bags and sugar to be told that we cannot bring anything to your room due to covid 19, but we can for an additional five pound fee how disgusting is that ... after this my partner then had to get out of bed to go up stairs to collect them him self in his pjs then to be told they did not have any white sugar nor spoons. They tried charging us for our breakfasts that we have already paid before arriving. Breakfast was standard over price to be honest for what it is.. they obviously cook and hold there food .... not a lot on offer at all either for breakfast... the breakfast area was the evening restaurant and all the biscuits and tea was at the other end of the restaurant so if you sat at the end with nothing up that end you would have to keep walking up and down while you had a big queue of people waiting to be seated.... one evening we wanted to go and explore the hotel boat be told that we could not go outside to the open area and that we could not go up stairs it was all closed of due to covid 19 I’m sure ... so other then your room there’s nothing else to see in this so called fantastic yacht... what a waste of money! ",2,2020,10,25
119,Mixed feelings ,"I visited the Sunborn with my family for an overnight stay with breakfast on the 19th Oct, it was my daughter's birthday and she was so looking forward to it . I has purchased the stay for 4 of us through groupon,  unfortunately,  and I suppose due to the current situation I could have got it cheaper had I have waited and bought nearer the time through another website. On check-in I was asked by the receptionist if we would like an upgrade to the riverside rooms , this set us back a further £60 for the 2 rooms , but we accepted and the rooms were nice enough,  and we also had a small balcony,  the bathroom was a bit of a let down, quite basic and, I d say, not even up to the standard you would get in a cheaper hotel . Dinner in the evening was served in the restaurant,  which was nice with lovely views , the meal was extremely expensive for what it was , and under different circumstances we d have been better eating out. The staff were attentive and pleasant. The bed was really comfortable,  we had a king room which had a little lounge area as well , no complaints there. 
The next morning spoilt the stay tbh, breakfast served up in a tray which was segmented,  the food was tasteless and rubbery,  the toast came in a bag and no plate to butter it on , really, I understand under the circumstances the need to cover the food but this was extreme and the breakfast experience was dire. On check out morning the staff were males, when asked if we had enjoyed our stay I said about the breakfast being dreadful but I might as well have spoke to the walls, straight away I was asked for the upgrade money without a bat of an eye and as if I had mentioned the breakfast.  I ve since read other reviews whereby people have been given free upgrades and this is particularly annoying when we spent what was a small fortune.  My advice,  spend your money elsewhere,  you ll get far more for it .",2,2020,10,25
119,"Out for the money, appalling customer service!","I chose to book this hotel as something a bit different for my fiancés birthday.  On first glance the hotel looked amazing from outside and I definitely had high expectations.  Parking was an absolute nightmare as everywhere was extremely expensive, although we finally managed to find something at a reasonable cost with Just Park behind the Crown Plaza hotel.  I proceeded to check in whilst my partner parked the car.  I explained to a woman on reception reception it was a birthday and she offered an upgrade at an extra cost which I accepted as this was a special occasion.  I quickly ran to the room to get it ready (balloons etc) and on first appearance it looked quite nice, although it had a musky smell (which I soon got rid of with scented candles).  The bathroom was slightly disappointing, but appeared to be functional until we realised there was no water.  In a hurry to leave for a restaurant booking, I informed reception on the way out that there was no water in our room. at which point he informed me that we should have been told during check in that was a water outage due to Thames water.  I explained  that the woman who checked us in hadn't informed us , but she was happy to sell us an upgrade.  He was extremely helpful and apologised and proceeded to refund us for the upgrade fee and explained that we couldn't be issued a refund as we had booked via Groupon.  To not spoil our evening any further we rushed to our restaurant booking with the hope the water would return when we got back to the hotel....And at this point the woman on reception had failed to tell us PRIOR to check in that there was not any water we were no longer eligible to claim any money back from Groupon as once checked in the liability lays with the hotel as per Groupons terms and conditions.  The water did not return that evening which completely spoiled our experience of the hotel, as we couldn't even flush the toilet.  We were told on our return that should we need any water for washing etc then they would supply us with water.  I proceeded to reception for some water as we obviously at least needed to wash our face and teeth, at which point she handed 2 small bottles of mineral water!!!! Seriously!!! After asking if she was serious, she handed us 2 more bottles and said is we needed any more to come to reception (not even brought to our room for the huge inconvenience she could have informed us off prior to checking in after 6pm!!!) Anyway after an uncomfortable night’s sleep in our so called king bed (2 singles pushed together which slowly moved apart) we proceeded to breakfast, which was served like plane food in a box with separate compartments and not very appealing!!   I have since contacted the hotel to raise a complaint which is met with nothing put false statements and my complaint being dismissed.  Originally I had contacted the Front office assistant manager who didn't even care to hear the details of my complaint and instead went on to speak about Thames water, when the jist of my complaint was us NOT being informed prior to check in that there was no water in the hotel, which would have made a huge difference, but instead we were offered an upgrade at a fee!! I knew the water outage was out of the hotels control but telling us was not !!!  I proceeded to make contact with the Operations manager and tried yet again to get across the purpose of my complaint, which yet again fell on deaf ears.  Instead I was yet again told about Thames water!! which wasn't my issue and then I was told all guests were told at check in !!! Clear lies as I had already told him I wasn't which was why I was complaining and why Leonardo had refunded the upgrade fee!!  This hotel is not worth the money and does not give what it shows on its external packaging.   The customer service and management (aside from one gentleman on reception) was appalling and they take no responsibility for their errors.  Last year we stayed at the Nvotel Canery Wharf which completely puts this hotel to shame in all aspects.  Oh I was offered a discount on my next stay but I can say without a doubt that  I will never return to such a poor hotel, because if the minor details haven't put me off, staff and management certainly have.  Better of spending your money elsewhere.",1,2020,10,22
119,Average Hotel ,"On arrival we couldn’t get any parking after been told by hotel staff via phone that we could park near hotel. So thought it would be cheaper than £20 per day. Looking on the hotel from the outside it looked impressive but that was all, for what we paid  two days I thought it was nicer. We had dirty sofa which wasn’t a problem as we got moved to a different room. We had to pay £40 per night as deposit which wasn’t mentioned during our booking. Breakfast price was separate from the room price, staff on check in wasn’t helpful on telling us where the restaurant was and what time  breakfast stopped serving. Overall we left a little disappointed from the poor check in customer service to having to pay so much for parking. And the rooms wasn’t as nice as we had expected. Good shower power, friendly restaurant staffs, comfortable bed. But won’t be in a hurry to stay there again.",3,2020,10,21
119,Service on Reception ,"Sarah in reception was really great! She gave our family a really kind welcome and went the extra mile to help us have a really good stay. Thank you Sarah. Unfortunately, the rest of the service was not so great, but these are challenging times and perhaps we need to all make allowances.",4,2020,10,18
119,So very disappointing.,"We'd heard such good things about the hotel but it definitely didn't deserve the accolades during our visit - mainly down to the breakfast.  Two nights stay, the cabin was clean, spacious and comfortable.  Comfy bed and we were put on the river side which was lovely.  
Breakfast the next day was pretty awful.  Full English arrived very swiftly after we'd sat down (too swiftly it appears) in a plastic, sectioned box.  That wouldn't have been so bad had it been hot and pleasant but it wasn't.  Everything was only warm;  the scrambled eggs were rubbery and cold and altogether horrible, the mushrooms were dark and tasteless as if they'd been boiled to death and the bacon was very fatty.  

Cutlery was provided in a sealed paper bag - knife and fork and two wooden stirrers, no spoons.   We helped ourselves to hot water and coffee from the large urns. Milk was provided in individual, small, plastic milk jiggers (sadly, we didn't have cereal as that would have been fun).   

Toast arrived in a paper and cellophane bag, much as you would get in a cheap cafe accompanied by two catering pats of  butter.  There was no side plate so we had to use the bag to spread etc...   
Juice was the small cardboard cartons with a handy straw stuck to the side.   As we left, we noticed many others had left their breakfast, so it wasn't just us.",3,2020,10,14
119,Lovely Stay,"I stayed at Sunborn Yacht for a night away to celebrate my partner's birthday. I booked a Classic King Room with River View and it was lovely. The room was nice and clean, the bed was comfy and the view out onto the river at night was amazing. 

The staff at reception and the bar were very helpful and friendly and the boat looks stunning inside when you arrive. All the staff were well presented and extremely professional.

If you're looking for a unique stay in London, I'd highly recommend staying at the Sunborn!",5,2020,10,14
119,Out of this world,Wow! It's better than the pictures. Friendly kind staff. So so clean and the room service burger wow! Compliments to the chef. River view is a must! Its simply stunning so cosy and warm I cant wait to go back. Oerfect value for money. Lovely having a drink outside the deck if the yacht with the mist amazing view. Right near bars etc oerfect place,5,2020,10,13
119,quick getaway/ early birthday celebrations,"1 night stay in an executive riverside room, I had originally booked for a classic dockside but upgrade for a small fee (definitely worth it) Our room was very spacious and cleaned to a high standard. The Bathroom is a little small but still has everything you need, who needs a large bathroom anyway. 

Check in process was quick and was told all the information we needed to know for our stay as well as a £40 pre authorisation per night so you are able to charge to your room. 

Unfortunately didn’t get to go to the bar as it was full but the restaurant was amazing! Can’t fault the service or quality of the food. Mario was our server for the evening, he always made sure we had everything we needed as well as always topping up our glasses, as this was for an early birthday celebration for me the service meant the world. I had the chicken supreme and my partner had the pan seared salmon, both amazing. 

Breakfast was slightly disappointing and service lacked a little from the night before but was still okay. 

Check out was again was quick and efficient. 

All in all we had a very good stay at the Sunborn, we hope to return in the Summer when we are able to sit out on the decking and enjoy the view.",4,2020,10,12
119,Average ,"I was really looking forward to staying on the Sunborn and booked a suite for our 10 year anniversary.
The Sunborn is very impressive from outside but once you enter through the lifts it doesn’t really live up to much, the drinks and food are average and all the outside decking areas where closed, this place could be amazing!
Room was very clean and spacious with a comfortable bed, but that’s about it really.
Not really 5* hotel in my eyes and would not stay again. ",3,2020,10,11
119,11th October 2020 Review,"We had a lovely stay here, had a mix up with our room but a woman called Sarah, was really professional and treated us so well changed our room to a river side instead of dockside, and It was perfect.",5,2020,10,11
119,Nice but not grand ,"Enjoyed a 1 night stay in a river view double room with tiny balcony. Clean and spacious but bathroom is very small with shower only. The bar area and restaurant lacks a bit of ambiance, very quiet, not even soft music playing in the background. 

Enjoyed lunch and dinner.

Entrance with big chandelier is quite impressive. Glitzy. 

Staff do their job but not overly welcoming. 

Still an enjoyable stay overall.",3,2020,10,09
119,Amazing,"I would just like to say a massive thank you to Sarah Nezam for making my boyfriend’s birthday special. Myself and boyfriend visited on 27th September and it was our first time. Sarah was very welcoming on arrival and made us feel welcome. I was abit nervous due to Covid19 but Sarah was very professional and, happy and outgoing and engaged with us which made me feel at ease.  This really impressed me.
 
We loved the hotel and all the staff were friendly. We will definitely be back for another stay soon.",5,2020,10,08
119,Miss,Stayed at sunburn yacht. Paid for room on arrival only to be charged for room again wen leaving .. charged £5/50 for two drinks to b brought to us in bar and £6-50 for 3 drinks Thst was service charge refused to pay as was happy to go to bar but was told no . Pay cash if go to this place and be careful wil over charge you,2,2020,10,08
119,Weekend in family room sea view,"Wow!!! 
Could not fault this place.....food....drink....room....everything about it was top end, beautiful & would highly recommend. 
Admittedly a bit costly but a real treat for any special occassion or to simply treat yourself or someone special.",5,2020,10,06
119,Ok stay,"Such a lovely hotel! Had a voucher brought for us as a wedding present. This was for dinner, night stay and breakfast. Obviously due to lockdown didn’t get to use when wanted. So booked for first weekend of October. Was informed that the restaurant was on a limited menu when booked the restaurant. So when emailed them as this was a voucher they informed us that they would change this for £100 credit to be used in the bar on food and drink. On the Saturday we ate out and then went back to sit in the bar. To then be told you can only sit in there if have booked it. Yet wasn’t told this on phone, in the email or even when we checked in. So this resorted in us going back to our room to order drinks, for it to take us to call up after an hour of ordering to chase it up. And also be charged £4 delivery! Just feel they need to inform you of the situations with bar and restaurant.  And of course didn’t use the full £100 either.",3,2020,10,06
119,Great but restaurant could be better!,"I stayed at this hotel for my partners birthday in early October 2020. We stayed in a classic river view room and the view was amazing. The room was extremely nostalgic and we felt comfortable instantly. Admittedly this was my first experience on a yacht hotel so naturally, I was expecting areas such as the bathroom to be much bigger. 

The room was great but on the other hand, I was unhappy with the Lands End Restaurant. I expected better service for dinner, the staff took a while to seat us and then after our orders arrived the staff forgot to bring us our cutlery. The waiter was so lovely and you could tell this wasn't intentional but it was just a busy evening. Unfortunately the evening I was visiting was for my partners birthday so I needed the service to be a little more stellar than what I'm used to!",3,2020,10,05
119,Amazing experience!,"Shocked to read the reviews below because I had a wonderful time with my partner. The hotel, from Start to finish accommodated my needs including surprising my partner for his birthday. Communication was polite, helpful and they went above and beyond. The food was absolutely amazing and the room was clean and beautiful. There were a couple of minor hiccups such as the coffee maker not working and room service not receiving my breakfast request however all members of staff went out of their way to correct it in rapid time. I honestly can’t complain and I would definitely return again.",5,2020,10,03
119,Nice room BUT..........,"The room was lovely and as expected due to current covid issues.  No water in room no biscuits with tea and coffee and coffee machine did not work.  Reception staff awful.  Tried to ring ahead and book a table to drink no one answered.  Emailed ahead no response.  We were told when someone answered the following morning that they were busy with breakfast and could not book us a table but we could try later on checkin.  We arrived early as were told they could keep luggage but room was not ready.  Can we go to the bar and have a drink......no.  Can we go and eat at restaurant.... no.  Can we book for later either to eat and/or drink? No sorry we are fully booked.  So basically you can stay at the hotel but cannot use any of the facilities of the hotel, and being at the excel and everything shut there is nothing about.  Tesco was close so we purchased some drink and food for later to eat in our room......hardly the relaxing stay that we had booked and paid for!  Would have had the same experience in a travelodge at 1/4 of the price!  Also BEWARE there was a small childs birthday party in a family room and the noise was horrendous....people coming and going all afternoon but I guess was easier than booking a venue (no longer allowed due to covid).  I think the days of luxury have long since been removed from this hotel.  This was the third stay and by far the worse reception staff were miserable and unhelpful and took over 30 minutes to check in even though we had already left our luggage.  Check out was a joke 11am but the queue was down 2flights of stairs and no social distancing.  There are hotels close by that are cheaper and I would definitely consider these for my next stay as definitely no customer service or warm welcome such a shame",3,2020,09,29
119,Awful,"My experience has been awful.
Room not up to standard.
Cocktails very expensive and poor quality.
Service appalling.
However my biggest criticism is that having given the front desk my credit card details on check in , they took an unauthorised payment of over £350.
The situation became more fraught when management did not contact me for several days (and numerous phone calls and emails from me) to resolve the matter.
After an apology from management a very poor good Will gesture was made.
I shall not be returning.
Moreover I had booked through Secret Escapes. Having explained everything that had happened in numerous emails and phone calls, I was essentially told that they could not help compensate me for my terrible experience. I shall not be using their service again either.",1,2020,09,29
119,Really good stay ,"We stayed here earlier this month after our initial stay was postponed due to covid outbreak. The staff throughout the experience from changing the initial day we stayed up to arriving at the hotel was very good. Staff were very friendly and accommodating and even gave us a complimentary upgrade. Room was clean and comfortable. My only criticism was breakfast, I appreciate that we are in a pandemic but why does the breakfast have to be served in a airline style tray. Every other restaurant serves food on a plate still but here was served in a segmented box which meant items could not be mixed together and secondly meant that the food went cold really quickly. Apart from the poor breakfast I could not fault the hotel and would happily stay again ",4,2020,09,27
119,Good stay but poor value for money and quality falls short. ,"Had a great stay overall on the yacht hotel in the London dock, mainly due to the location and the novelty factor of staying on a yacht on the river Thames docks. The room was OK just OK but very noisy we where in 1023 and every hour or so a large automatic pump would start up and wake you. Maybe insist your room is on a higher deck ? Food in the restaurant was perfect for dinner but Breakfast was a shambles both of ours went back to the kitchen but second attempt was better. Cocktails are great and bar staff fantastic but a drinking session will cost you £100 + per couple with drinks between £10 and £15 a pop. In my honest opinion it’s worth a visit but limit your expectations this isn’t a luxury hotel experience. ",3,2020,09,26
119,Fantastic location underwhelming food and service,"Walking onto the boat is very impressive. The room was clean and as expected. Visited the restaurant which was very disappointing. Waited 45 minutes for a drink despite booking and ordering once we sat down. The food was completely average. The staff seemed overwhelmed with the number of people eating despite it not being very busy. We then headed for the bar which we could not get access to. There were empty tables which had bookings, but rather then say we could sit down until they arrived, they told us to sit outside (the weather was appalling). Very unfriendly staff. Breakfast took 50 minutes to arrive and was totally inedible. We sent the food back once, waited another 20 minutes and what came out was still inedible. Check out was shocking, long queues and extremely slow. Overall, the standard of service is not good enough for the amount you pay. Would not recommend this venue.",2,2020,09,26
119,Birthday booking,"The room was excellent.   We had at a balcony room overlooking the water. Boat is a in lovely location.
Downside.   Check - in Process very slow, Service in the bar area and Restaurant was appalling.  Pre booked a table in the bar @18:15  nothing ready dirty glasses on tables.  Finally sat down at 18:40  after telling then we dinner reservation at 19:00.. Dinner was as bad.. 1hr 30 and finally got main course. Steak overcooked.   Due to this ordered room service breakfast and that arrived on time and was very nice 
I would stay again but not eat 
I wouls stay again but not eat.",3,2020,09,21
119,Birthday stay,Stayed in hotel for my birthday my husband booked as surprise and I loved it for the experience. But the room smelt a little due to no windows in room. Other than that everything else was fine. The bed was clean and the bathroom was clean.,4,2020,09,20
119,Very disappointing,"Really disappointed with our experience here. We booked the yacht hotel as it sounded and looked great online but the whole experience was sadly not what we were expecting. 

Upon arrival we were queued to get into the hotel at some lifts which appeared to be the only way in. There were no staff outside to advise you how to get on the boat. After waiting for 15 - 20 minutes we figured out you couldn't work the lifts without a room key card. Eventually a member of staff opened a side door and let us all in. We had to lug our suitcase up several flights of stairs to get to reception though which wasn't ideal. 

We finally checked in and had real issues with the lifts getting to our floor to access our room. Advice - use the stairs! The lifts take a very long time to arrive and even then you'll be lucky if you get to the right floor! 

When we eventually got to the room we were quite disappointed. The decor is very dated and missing simple things like shower gel, hand towels, complimentary water and to top it off the coffee machine was broken. You are provided with a tablet in the room to order things on to the room, but that didn't work either! I tried to ring reception and they answered and then put the phone down. Great service...!

In the afternoon we decided to go down to the bar for a drink before heading out to dinner. We queued to be seated for at least 20 minutes and no one came. Eventually we asked the barman if there were any seats outside and he shook his head, so we left.

Returning after dinner there was the same long queue to get back onto the boat. The side door wasn't open so we were waiting for the temperamental lifts again in the cold. 

The one positive thing was that the bed was very comfy! But the walls are thin and you can hear people walking in the rooms above, below and either side so if you are a light sleeper you might want to bring ear plugs. 

In the morning we queued for a table for breakfast and then it took 45 minutes for our breakfast to come. The eggs royal was really nice, so another positive there. 

Overall really disappointed and would not stay again.",2,2020,09,20
119,Fabulous,"Had a fantastic stay in a stunning executive room with its own balcony. Absolutely loved the heated floor in the bathroom. Staff were amazing. Totally professional, helpful and friendly.Thank you all.",5,2020,09,17
119,First stay not impressed ,"Me and my partner Stayed here last weekend for my 30th birthday present and at first site it was beautiful and was so happy but that quickly changed We booked through wowcher so when checking in we was asked to show the paperwork and to pay a £40 security deposit on the room I offered the £40 in cash which was refused I explained to the receptionist neither of us had a card on us as we didn’t want to lose them and was not informed that a security deposit would need to be paid by chip and pin or by card only, as we only had cash she said due to COVID they could not accept it and we could not be able to check in. I then sat down in reception were no body was socially distanced trying to find a way to be checked in the receptionist let us sweat and gave us no other option or to try and help us, I tried offering some off my belongings for security as we had traveled a while and was desperately to just check in she then after around 20mins half hour went to ask a member of staff who agreed to let us check in but we would not be aloud to have any room service (which Was another knock On our experience) but we agreed just so we could be seen to our room.. the view was lovely but other than that the room was pretty standard the bed was 2 singles pushed together And not a double bed. We ended up going out to eat and on our return I wanted a cup of tea there was no water in the fridge and when going to the bar to buy some water we was told we could only buy if we had the correct change as they was expecting cash just not giving back any change? (Pointless) a bottle of water (medium size) was £5:50! We managed to get correct change and have our water.. in the morning we woke up for breakfast we was shown to our seats by the waiter who was also not wearing a face mask, we was told to fill out a form we either had the full English or continental, iv never stayed in a hotel that you have either or and not both? Considering how much we paid for the hotel plus more for the breakfast I was disappointed .. u could help your self to tea coffee or orange juice but anything else off the menu you had to pay extra. Considering this was my 30th bday gift first night always as new parents and first stay since COVID I was sadly not impressed. ☹️☹️☹️☹️

119,Birthday treat,"We arrived after having lunch in the city, Finland certainly has a fantastic concept ,allowing guests to embrace been on a boat even though you're in 'dry dock' . The only negative is the  poor location which can be ignored once you're allocated your room by the most charming and charismatic reception staff that you'd wish to meet ..Leonardo was the main instigator,  as he even upgraded us to a balcony room/chalet all I wish for now is an amazing breakfast ",5,2020,09,17
119,Fabulous stay.,I was here for two days for my birthday. The staff were all amazing especially this staff called Sarah she is absolutely amazing i have never come across such polite and all professional person like her. She explained everything to me and was down to earth words is not enough to thank her as she make my day very memorable. Thank you Sarah keep up the good work. The food also was amazing i will definitely come back and i hope to see Sarah again.  Maureen onefeli and Dora. ,5,2020,09,14
119,A pleasant stay,"The hotel was nice and clean. The staff were friendly and had all the basic amenities that are needed. Our roo
M was overlooking the sea which was nice and pleasant. The hotel also gave us complimentary chocolates which we were not expecting. If any downside it’s rather dated and could do with modernisation.",4,2020,09,08
119,Fabulous yacht,We’re here for a long weekend celebrating my husbands 60th birthday the staff are very helpful and happy can’t do enough for you the yacht is spotlessly clean our room is amazing there are plenty of bars and restaurants with in walking distance the excell building is sat the the right and the O2 is a short cable car ride away train station is just a few minutes walk we ate in the restaurant the first night my food was lovely my husband had steak which he sent back we didn’t have breakfast but had a cocktail in the lovely bar tho it was expensive £15 each all in all a lovely 3 night stay,5,2020,09,07
119,Lovely ,"Went for an overnight stay. Was really lovely. Got upgraded to a cabin with a small balcony which was nice to sit on & people watch! Cabin was much bigger than I expected & had everything we needed. Had a drink in the bar which was very nice & relaxed. Great views of the 02. 
Couldn’t book for breakfast but went down about 8am & didn’t have to wait for table. It was lovely! All the staff were very friendly ",5,2020,09,02
119,Very disappointed,"We have just been away for are anniversary me and my wife and there was one rude polish lady at the reception area who tried her best to not let us stay the night as we was a young coupple and didn’t have the bank card we paid for the hotel on with us , we traveled all the way down from wales and was one of the worst experience and service form the staff on the boat , we even went to sit in the restaurant for a meal and not one waiter or waitress would walk over to serve our order , I had to get up and go make my order my self , 
Very rude and money grabbing people they also don’t give you your change for any of the food or drink , so if your drinks came to £25 and you only had two £20 notes they will keep your change .
HIGHLY DISAPPOINTED AND NEVER WILL. RETURN SUCH A POORL RUN YACHT !!!! I HOPE THISMPOLISH LADY SEES TBIS BECAUSE IF YOU CAN SEE THIS YOU WAS DISGUSTING AND VERY RUDE AND YOU SHOULD NEVER HAVE THE OPPORTUNITY TO SERVE CUSTOMERS WITH A WELCOME",1,2020,09,02
119,Amazing service,"Arrived at the hotel and was served by Sami, received amazing hospitality from him and we were looked after well by him. He ensured that the service we received was quick and easy and Made our stay really enjoyable",5,2020,09,02
119,"Lovely room, lovely view, shame about the food!","Stayed last Saturday night.  The room was spacious, well furnished and bed very comfortable. Lovely view of the Thames. But the food was served in the bar, unfortunately in a black box, as was breakfast. We have been to a few restaurants this month, and always had our food on a plate. Also you had to go to a machine for your breakfast coffee, thus negating the idea of sitting in one place and not spreading or catching germs.  The food was only average, not spectacular.
The COVID response has not been thought out properly, what a pity!",4,2020,08,30
119,Amazing Experience.,"I stayed there for 2 nights for a small Birthday Celebration.

The hotel give you a very luxurious feel.

Our room was upgraded and was with sea view.
The decoration done by the staff was really decent and pretty.

The staff was really friendly and helpful, specially Mr Leonardo, he was so kind and helpful. We was given a small tour of the Ship and we really enjoyed our time there.",5,2020,08,30
119,Disappointed,"Came here for a well earned break for my Big 50! Looked at the amazing photos and it looked so luxurious!
Big mistake! First instance lift grotty and what with this bloody corona I felt was not right! Yes we were a bit early to check in but the guy gave us our key! We had been upgraded can’t remember why but room was scruffy bed looked like someone had just got up and pulled covers back! I called reception and got told as we were early that was the only room available! So we went off as bar was closed and came back few hours later. This room was much better BUT told restaurant closed and to have room service was extra £4 . Could book a slot at the bar but fully booked! So on my birthday sat in room watching snooker and waiting for deliveru to bring a takeaway. Hubby went across to Tesco to get a drink as couldn’t even get a drink! Don’t waste your money as no different than an average travel lodge",3,2020,08,27
119,Birthday Stay,"We had an amazing stay at the Sunborn Yatch Hotel. The hotel is right next to Excel and our room had a sea view and a lovely balcony.

The good 

First impression was good, the staffs were extremely polite and helpful. And a big thanks to the restaurant staffs that wished me a happy birthday. Everytime I walked past the reception whoever was behind the reception took out the 30 secs to say hello. 

Our room was big and very clean. The room had ironing facilities, tea and coffee and a mini fridge. A big bonus for me was the smart TV, it definitely made my stay more comfortable. 

The location is good for anyone looking for a day out in London. 5mins walk from DLR and Emirates cable car to 02.

We had brunch in the restaurant and the food was delicious. We didn't have breakfast so I am unable to comment on that. 

There are lots of places to eat around the hotel and if you fancy some entertainment cross over to 02 for more options. 

Bad
The only let down was the WiFi and general phone signal. I dont know if its a combination of the strong wind and bad network from Three but I could barely use my phone and it didn't help that the Hotel ke WiFi wasn't great, I had to reconnect every 5 mins and it was just frustrating.

As mentioned in the previous reviews there are no reasonable parking around and it will cost you £20 for 24 hours, if you are staying a day or 2 it's not bad but it does start to add up if you are a staying longer.

Overall we enjoyed our stay and we would definitely come back.",5,2020,08,27
119,Really nice!,"We initially booked two nights here but enjoyed it so much we stayed an extra night. When we checked in around 8pm there was a bit of a mix up with the rooms and they couldn’t find our booking, however this was fixed promptly and they even upgraded our room free of charge! 

The room was great and spacious, the beds extremely comfortable. The bathroom was really hot but we actually didn’t mind that. 

The only thing that let our stay down slightly was the wait for breakfast. The service is quite slow and we waited 45 minutes today for our breakfast. 

All together though I would definitely stay here again!",4,2020,08,27
119,Lovely Hotel but lacking a few amenities ,"Stayed the night in the Sunborn with a lovely room overlooking the river (worth paying the extra otherwise you are looking out at a dockside),

The hotel was immaculate and the staff very friendly and helpful

Beware the hotel has no parking and nearest car park about 600 metres away (£20 for 24 hours flat rate - even if your only there for 2 hours)

My only real criticism is the room amenities.  Just 2 teabags and milk portions and it would have been nice to have had a couple of bottles of complimentary water in the fridge like most hotels of this standard in London

Otherwise really nice stay",5,2020,08,26
119,Fantastic anniversary stay,We booked this hotel on a refundable deal as we weren’t sure how things would progress with lockdown. Happily we were able to stay and were warmly welcomed by Loranas on reception who had put us in a wonderful suite for our Silver Anniversary. The bathroom was a particular highlight with our own sauna and jacuzzi. It was a huge treat and we had a great time.,5,2020,08,26
119,Afternoon tea,"Easy to find from the tube - we got off at Excel and walked over the bridge. Took about 30 mins from central London on the DLR. We were late and trying to call through to let them know we were coming was an absolute joke, and then the waitress had the cheek to question me why we were late. 
It looks incredible sitting in the dock and the reception area looked very grand. Up close, the place looks a little tired though, particularly in the restaurant area. 
The afternoon tea was good, we had a good view overlooking the dock with Canary Wharf in the distance. Bit of a lack of savoury options for me personally - 4 sandwiches just wasn't enough so I asked for a couple more and was presented with six.
The sweet treats were nice but I'm afraid too sickly that neither of us could finish it.",4,2020,08,25
119,Nice anniversary stay,"We wanted to do something different for our anniversary without travelling too far, so why not stay on a yacht opposite the ExCel? We explored the hotel in the day and in the evening. The onboard bar is definitely more atmospheric at night and the scotch eggs were great. I'd personally recommend eating elsewhere for dinner while the restaurant is closed as the bar isn't ideal for dining - we went to Gaucho in Canary Wharf for our main meal which was fantastic. The hotel rooms are lovely, the bed was super comfy, the staff are doing as much as possible to maintain social distancing and having breakfast in bed was a real treat. All in all, we had a great stay and recommend it as a hotel and event venue rental.",5,2020,08,24
119,The best birthday!,"My boyfriend booked this as a surprise for my birthday and it didnt disappoint. He found a deal online for a night stay with breakfast and seemed too good to be true. On arrival they upgraded us to an executive suite which had lots of space, a balcony, underfloor heating in the bathroom, a coffee machine (for me this was a major plus) and the most comfy bed. There was a tablet to order drinks etc but unfortunately this didnt work however there was also a phone to contact reception. 

Breakfast the next morning was fab (could have full english, pancakes, porridge, bacon sandwich etc) all made to order. Francisco was lovely and chatty as we checked out. Would highly recommend!",5,2020,08,24
119,Nice Stay,"Overall nice stay, room nice with balcony. Slow service in the evening maybe they are on reduced staffing level due to Covid? Breakfast nice. Location okay little out of it but knew that when booking. ",4,2020,08,23
119,Fantastic location,"We had a lovely view of the river from our very spacious and clean room. Bed very comfortable.
Great food (had the salmon for dinner) and service from reception to Mario and Pierre(?) in the bar who were very friendly and professional.
We stayed during the week, it did look very busy on the Saturday lunchtime with queues for reception and the bar as we left.Would recommend and stay again for something different.",5,2020,08,21
119,Business meeting,"Amazing experience!!! ❤

I was invited by one of my friends for a business meeting.
Staff is very friendly, if you have any questions regarding restaurant, bar or accommodations are happy to help you.
Restaurant is based at the first floor, in front you can see Canary wharf, splendid view ❤, I can suggest to join them for afternoon tea, different experience.
Bar menu is well balanced, different types of Gin, whisky, bourbon and cocktails.
Service is very good, thank you Jennifer for hospitality.

119,Expected worse after reading some reviews,"I booked this for a birthday treat for my boyfriend for the first weekend of August. Prior to our arrival I tried calling the hotel to make a restaurant reservation but no one ever answered. I then email the hotel again to receive no reply. On a whim I called the evening before our stay at 10pm and finally managed to get through to someone who booked a table at the bar for me. After reading some of the reviews and having no response from the hotel thus far I was concerned.

We arrived just before 3 and waiting in line about 10 minutes to check in. Check in was smooth except for the fact I was under the impression that I had already booked breakfast but apparently it wasn't on my booking.
Our room was on the 1st floor at the very back of the vessel. It was a nice size, clean and tidy. The bed was also huge. We booked breakfast on the tablet for 9am the next morning. We enjoyed afternoon drinks on the deck of the bar and some snacks. My concerns were no a distant memory.

Dinner was lovely and considering this was only the bar food, I cannot wait until the restaurant reopens. However this was where things started to go downhill. Our desserts took well over an hour to be brought over. On return to our cabin we decided to have a hot drink. Our coffee machine did not work no matter what we tried. We then ordered a tea and coffee for room service. I later found out that these had cost me well over £20. £4.50 each for  the drinks, £5 room service fee, £4.50 tray charge and then the 12.5% Service charge

Breakfast was surprisingly delivered 15 minutes early. However it was missing my coffee (I was destined not to have coffee during this stay) and toast and the hot food was barely warm.

Upon check out and reporting these issues I was given a refund of the tax at £16. On  further inspection there was no refund as this had been deducted from the full rate which included the £40 deposit. It was a crafty trick and very untruthful. I could have overlooked the other issues as they were just minor, but the offer of a goodwill gesture to be sneakily not given is just not on. A trip that should have cost me no more that £190 ended up costing in excess of £225. Not including the cost of drinks and dinner",3,2020,08,19
119,Anniversary stay,"Booked a executive room for our anniversary and have to say I won’t be returning . We didn’t get into our room until 3:30 because check in was chaotic it was advertised as luxurious with robes and slippers but after I enquired to the lack of these I was told due to COVID they were not being provided . Bit strange as I would hope they wouldn’t reuse slippers . The carpet had an iron mark on it , the sofa was damp and had stains on it and the room to be honest was very tired . The in room tablet didn’t work so we went to reception and ordered breakfast for 8 am as we had to leave early but it failed to arrive so I spoke to a housekeeper and we got a phone call at 8:50 to say they forgot to order it and brought it at 9. Breakfast itself was ok but we had to leave so didn’t finish it.  I would avoid staying here at all costs , luxury it is not .",2,2020,08,17
119,Really wouldn’t recommend,Visited 16/08/20 for my partners birthday and had a really rubbish stay! I never go out of my way to write a review but I have to as the whole experience was so poor. Arrived at 3pm checked in and went to the room (I had organised and pre paid to have birthday balloons banners and drinks left in the room) None of which was in there! Get a phone call a few minutes after asking if all was ok with the room to which I respond no because you just confirmed at check in that the room was decorated and it isn’t! The staff member then tells me yes that’s why I was calling you need to come back to the reception?? Back to the reception we go to wait about 15 minutes whilst someone obviously rushes around to decorate another room. Very unorganised. When we get to the new room there are three pink balloons and a birthday girl banner when it was for my BOYFRIENDS birthday and I had explained this to them On the phone and email before staying at the hotel! Weird and expensive - total waste of money! Ordered room service incorrect orders received and the food was really poor! Later that evening a member of staff let’s themselves into our room whilst we are in bed SO AWKWARD then apologises and leaves! Can honestly say it’s one of the worst hotel stays I’ve ever had if you’re looking to celebrate a nice occasion dont book this! The only thing I can imagine being nice is the outside deck where you could have a drink but it isn’t open at the moment so really don’t bother!,2,2020,08,17
119,Great experience ,"My wife and I stayed here overnight on 15/8/20. We enjoyed every minute. We booked an evening meal which had to be taken in the bar as restaurant was closed due to COVID . All 3 courses came in these boxed trays but were no way any less quality. All 3 courses were fantastic. We actually had the same to eat, tempura prawns , the Burger(best tasting burger ever) and sticky toffee pudding.
Our only small minus’s would be for a 5 star we would’ve hoped there would’ve been bath robes supplied and also only 1 already started toilet roll was supplied. I know we could’ve asked for more if we’d run out but we just about didn’t run out. My wife would’ve liked if English butter was supplied at the breakfast service
We would like to visit again ",5,2020,08,17
119,Afternoon Tea,"The afternoon tea is excellent, well presented and served in great surroundings. A good choice of teas and coffees. The scones were warm. A great afternoon the staff were very good
A nice way to treat someone special.",5,2020,08,15
119,Absolute gem! ,"Me and my partner stayed here for a night away on August the 14th , it was absolutely stunning the room and everything was perfect! I had a look on the trip advisor reviews after we had already booked and please don’t be put off ! Most of the comments are probably people that expect the world! , the room was immaculate ! The staff at the front desk so helpful and friendly Sarah who dealt with us was so nice! The lift is very confusing but once you get to know it it’s fine !, the location is perfect you can get the cable thing over to the 02 arena where theirs bars and restaurants such a perfect romantic stay away ! Highly recommend! ",5,2020,08,15
119,"Disappointing, could do bettter.","As other reviewers have mentioned, this hotel is a very impressive superyacht in Royal  Docklands London.  we have no complaints about our room, it was large with all the ameneties. But we were disappointed with the service over our two day stay. We checked in at the appointed time and we were going to meet our family for a meal elsewhere , the resturant is closed.  We decided to have a drink and something light before meeting our family and thats when things go pear shaped.  We went to the bar / dining area and we were asked to sign in again with our details, ? we had been signed in at reception so cant understand why this was needed again. we ordered two drinks and two starters. nothing appeared for half an hour. we asked a waitress to find where our order was, she said she would find out but then didnt come back.  when our drinks finally came we said if the food wasnt coming to just forget it, we were going to meet our family.  the next morning we had full english brekfast outside with no complaints. thats the best part of our stay. Today before we checked out they got our breakfast order completely wrong again, my wife got hers, my breakfast we had to ask twice where it was, you couldnt make it up. we checked out and left. we will not be returning any time soon.",3,2020,08,13
119,"Impressive, different, yet could be better","Firstly... not many things make quite a statement as staying in a superyacht in the middle of London...
However the smugness at revealing how reasonable the price was, definitely made it easier to show off the pictures.

Although it’s a difficult time to visit hotels, they certainly made it a memorable stay, and the staff were fantastic, friendly and it felt natural.

Check in took a little while due to the queue for the lift, as when we arrived only one was in use. Under normal circumstances this wouldn’t be an issue however during the current climate it did require a wait, but only 20-30 minutes so no harm done.

We had opted for the executive river view room, which came with a lovely classy interior, a large bed, sofa, coffee machine, a tv( if you require one when away) and a wonderfully large mirror)

Plenty of storage space with full length wardrobes for dresses and suits, and none of these slotted hotel hangers so you could easily use the wardrobe.

The room came with a generous balcony, with chairs. Although whilst seated you can’t see anything, but it was a lovely space to drink a glass of wine. (The fridge also helps)

We had a tablet for ordering room service, which was also used for the restaurant and bar, although table service was also in operation making everything run smoothly.

The food was good, although more reflecting the reasonable price of the hotel than the status it commanded but, despite upmarket pub grub the food was excellent and the cocktails even better. Especially when having drinks on the deck commanded such a fantastic view.

In the morning we were served breakfast in bed, although check your reservation as we were initially told we had no breakfast but when we showed our reservation we were promptly served breakfast of our choice with a late checkout on the house. Although this was a far cry from the buffet style we would have had, and toast arriving in cellophane bags is the most ridiculous thing ever as it leads to damp toast. But I was impressed with how they dealt with the issue.

Excellent service and a wonderfully different way to stay in London. With its close proximity to the cable cars and Greenwich it was very accessible too.",4,2020,08,11
119,Well what a special start to my son's 10th birthday 🎉,"I stayed here recently for my son's 10th birthday (this Mon to Tuesday) and my word how brilliant was the ambience, the staff, the whole ship was 11/10 for sure. The yacht was majestic and I have to say I felt truly relaxed and in a different world that just consisted of contentment and tranquillity. The afternoon tea was amazing and the breakfast service truly exceptional that I would like to thank the whole sunborn team for providing such perfection. I didn't want to return to reality and have already booked my second stay for my own birthday 🎉",5,2020,08,11
119,Slightly disappointed,"I had wanted to stay at this hotel for a long time and found a great deal on secret escapes. 
However, on arrival the receptionist was less than helpful, it was almost assumed that we would know our way around. 
The room was clean, and bed quite comfortable. Air con an issue as no control over this, as stated on in room tablet? No water in fridge and no bathrobes. Called reception who blamed covid for no water and executive rooms no longer provided with bath robes. Again, both advertised on tablet in room? The 3rd party dealing with advertising should be up updated. 
Staff worked tirelessly and ran around like head less chickens, and couldn't provide proper customer service, but deserve utmost credit for keeping the hotel going, they are doing a great job. I would advise getting more in as you are in danger of losing the ones you have to another company that would treat them better, as you will guest's. 
Whilst I understand covid is an issue, do not use this as a blame factor for everything. Not providing water in rooms but providing room service seems a bit of a contradiction. It's cost cutting, not covid? 
The booking a table scenario seemed more like a Boris speech. Book a table, no you can't book a table, have you booked a table? We can't guarantee a table. But you should book a table? 
With people not going abroad and it being peak times for holidays now is a time you can try and claim back some of the losses, but only with the right amount of staff and customer service. 
Also look at your advertising in and out house as its sending mixed messages. 
I will return again in the future, to hopefully get the experience I was hoping for.",3,2020,08,10
119,From bad to worse,"
We stayed on a Saturday to Sunday. As it was the night of our covid-19 wedding we originally wanted to stay in the suite but this was already booked so not wanted to spend too much money on a room we didn't really want we stayed in a cheaper room 2043 and I regret it. 
From the outside the hotel looks amazing and nice setting, but as you wait for the slow lifts to take you up to reception it all starts to go downhill. 

Bedroom 
When we arrived in our room #2048 we quickly noticed the constant symphony of door slamming. I have stayed on a boat before so I know the doors can be quite heavy but to hear everyone's doors slamming upstairs and in the hallway was highly annoying, especially when we just wanted to rest after the wedding. There is no sound proofing to rooms and when the people in the room above us kept walking it was making the whole room shake like a herd of elephants had moved in. This also woke me up in the night when they came back after midnight. 
Shaking rooms due to people walking upstairs
I was disappointed for a 4 star hotel not to have  bottled water in room especially during the heat wave London has had. I opted to walk a short distance to get bottled water instead of paying over £3 for 500ml Water Bottle. Our room had a window but this did not open, so we had no fresh air. The TV has Freeview. Teas and coffee pods (with no markings) were supplied in the room alongside a coffee machine and a kettle. 
In the cupboard were two glasses and two cups. 

There multiple plug sockets, lights by bed, black out curtains, nice furnishings, big space and iron and ironing board. These were my only plus' for my entire stay

There was a fridge but no mini bar
The room was advertised as a double bed room but it was two twins put together and I kept falling in the gap at night. 
Smoke detecters and sprinklers. 
Use of tablet in room for room service. 
Nice sofa but one side of the arms is broken and fully tented in. 

Bathroom
Standard bathroom, Large Shower, Toilet and Sunk. 
Glasses not matching, and did not fit in glass fixtures (see photo)
I found it very annoying we booked a 2 adult room and there was only one towel in the bathroom the other being in the cupboard outside the bathroom. The bathroom also smelt of cigarettes/smoking which was also very annoying considering it is a no smoking room.

Breakfast was A la carte due to COVID-19 and is 7am-11am on the Sunday morning . It's 
Normally buffet. This lead to some confusion for me as guest were only allowed to order one meal from the menu. I ordered a full English breakfast and pancakes and was quickly told I'd have to pay extra for pancakes as I was only allowed one meal. Very confusing as if its normal buffet I should be able to order as much as I'd like. 
I opted for the full English and stated that I did not want mushrooms due to allergies. Low and behold mushrooms were on my tray when food arrived and my toast was placed in a paper bag. I asked for a side plate and I was asked why I needed a plate. I replied so I have somewhere to butter my toast as the tray was full. I was then told I could not get one because of covid-19 (this seemed to be the answer for a lot of their excuses). When I told them my partners food was served on a plate, I got a stropy waitress dump and empty box on my table, when I asked where the plate was I got a loud sigh from the waitress. So much for not being able to provide me with a plate. I found it strange that coffee was self service. 

I would not stay here again and do not feel like this is a 4 star hotel. Looks can be very deceiving.

119,Treated so well and enjoyed our stay,"We were treated very well during our stay, check in was quick and easy and all the staff were so friendly and helpful. The room was great and we would really recommend this place to stay. The room was perfectly clean and the bed comfortable. The only negative thing was the noisy fridge that is very loud at night. 
The breakfast the next day was really good. ",5,2020,08,09
119,Disappointing,"Myself & my fiancé stayed here as part of his birthday present. To say it was disappointing is an understatement for a number of reasons- 
We booked with secret escapes so we weren’t able to take advantage of the 10% NHS/Keyworkers discount. Due to COVID their restaurant is closed and only the Bar area is open for food/drink. But you must book your time slot in the bar well in advance. I emailed to book the bar, but nobody replied to my email. We had arranged an alternative dinner venue anyway, so not really a big deal, but it would have been nice to have had a few drinks at the bar/on the deck enjoying the views. 
I had paid for breakfast included, we opted for breakfast in bed, which was an additional £5 each for the service. Unfortunately the tablet in our room didn’t work so we ordered the breakfast items at the main reception. We were very much looking forward to it at 9am. Breakfast didn’t arrive, and when we called reception they had no record of the booking. They offered to make something and bring to the room but at that point we didn’t trust their capability and we had to check out. Very disappointing. 
The room itself was clean, but very dated and no water supplied in the fridge. I don’t drink tea or coffee so this wasn’t really acceptable to me. 
We feel that the hotel simply can’t cater for the amount of guests they are booking. The area itself has limited restaurants open, everything was fully booked except The Docklands Bar & Grill (absolutely amazing customer service and saved our mini break!!). So the hotel itself- couldn’t provide an evening meal, drinks in the evening, adequate refreshments in the room or breakfast. 
Glad we didn’t pay full price as, in my opinion, it is not worth it given the lack of facilities and lack of hospitality. I wouldn’t stay here again nor recommend either. I would highly recommend a stay at The Docklands Bar & Grill, the service is excellent!! 
A real shame!!",1,2020,08,09
119,Not Disappointed,"We spent a day and night on the Sunborn with friends celebrating our anniversaries. From start to finish we found the staff really friendly and helpful and the accommodation was lovely and clean. It’s been one of those places we really wanted to stay at and we’re not at all disappointed. The main restaurant was closed due to Covid but the restaurant in the bar was open and served good food. Considering staff have to follow stricter rules regarding everyone’s health and safety, we found the service was very good. I would love to go back at some point and highly recommend it to anyone who wants something a little different to the norm. Thank you to all staff for a great time whilst staying there xx",5,2020,08,09
119,Disappointed.,"Clearly not enough staff - took a long time to order and also had to wait for my food for 2 hours, in the end it came out cold. Any concerns I had had to be brushed away considering the staff were running around like headless chickens. Despite everything, the staff were nice and the receptionist was pleasant, I had no troubles with them. I was really expecting more after reading the reviews from the past year.",1,2020,08,07
119,Amazing experience,"Started the trip out with a few issues. They couldn't find my dinner reservation, was the biggest one. I was really disappointed. But we waited and it was completely worth it. The waiter, Toby, really gave us the best experience. He was extremely professional, kind, funny, and attentive. He made sure we were happy the entire time. He was so good, that we didn't even realize it took over an hour for our food to arrive. The food was so worth the wait (the wait we didn't even notice). We both really loved our entrees and would recommend highly. The champagne was also a nice addition. I particularly liked the cocktails though.
We can both appreciate that times have changed and staff is doing their best to cope with new regulations and whatever. I think as long as you keep staff like Toby, people won't notice that there are any behind the scenes issues (because if there were, we had no idea). Will definitely be back. Such a wonderful experience that could have been really bad.",5,2020,08,07
119,What a find!,"What a superb getaway my wife and I have just had, for three nights aboard the superyacht opposite Excel! Excellent customer service (e-mails to make the trip bespoke were all followed through efficiently by Stella) and nothing was too much trouble. The reception is on floor 3 (accessible by lift at the entrance), but we preferred the side entrance - which the reception staff were always happy to open for us. We stayed in room 2012 (with a river view) - spacious, very comfortable and gorgeous views over the docks and stunning panorama of Canary Wharf at night. The staff coped incredibly well under difficult, Covid-secure circumstances, and the breakfast can be delivered to your room for a tray charge of £5. We would definitely recommend!",5,2020,08,06
119,Worst experience ever ,"We booked a room in this hotel for a one night getaway celebrating our anniversary which was not cheap and was absolutely not even up to standards. Everything about this place was bad. Since we entered the room we could feel the bad smell, bad air stuffed with cigarets. The floor had so much dust looking like it wasn’t cleaned few months. The large mirror had huge stains. The bathroom wasn’t cleaned properly with shower bottles left from previous quests. There were few things out of order like lamp not working and sink plugged with water stuck. This is shocking having such cleanliness issues especially during the Covid epidemic. It was so cold on the whole boat everywhere bar, reception, room. Especially awful cold in the room and this could not be regulated I felt sick on the next morning. 
We had a reservation at the bar since the restaurant is closed. There was no sense to book a table as we had to wait anyway because they made some reservation mistakes. The food was disgusting can’t even understand how can you ruin burger with fries... For the drinks it was ok but to get served you had to run after staff , wait for ages and this was same everywhere. 
Staff unprofessional rude inattentive and you can’t blame COVID it’s just unprofessional there wasn’t even that much customers... 
Breakfast was awful. Awful food, awful staff being rude this just ruined my mood and was the last droop we couldn’t wait to get out of that place. When checking out we mentioned everything and all we could here just take this card make an email complaint. Not even I feel sorry for you. The funniest that this card had wrong email address. 
I would never recommend this place to stay. Maybe just bar because of view if you prefer bad food, drinks and service!!!!! To see the view just come to that beautiful area no need to waist lots of money on this sinking boat. ",1,2020,08,05
119,Thank you!!!,"On Sunday evening I went to the Sunborn hotel whereby I was greeted by Sarah and her customer service was AMAZING she went above and beyond to ensure that I had a good stay. She is an asset to the Sunborn team, thank you much Sarah!

I had dinner at 7pm and whilst dinner was slightly delayed due to COVID, Jeremy was really attentive in ensuring my cousin and I were okay whilst waiting for dinner. I interacted with the staff at the Sunborn and they were all lovely but I wanted to give Sarah and Jeremy I special acknowledgement as they went above and beyond to ensure I enjoyed my stay - thank you!",5,2020,08,04
119,SARAH,"On arrival me and my cousin was able to be welcomed by one of their amazing staff members called Sarah, she was very attentive, professional and overall lovely woman! She really goes above and beyond! She offered to take our pictures and everything! Made our stay! If you go and plan to do any type of event eg birthday (like ours) or proposals make sure you speak to Sarah prior! Your other staff were great also !

Rooms were clean and bed the was very comfy",5,2020,08,03
119,"Worst experience ever, shocking service","I booked in for afternoon tea to celebrate my dads and my boyfriends birthday. We turn up and are told to wait in the lobby for the waitress who would come get us. 10 minutes later we are still waiting so I go back to see what’s going on, to then be asked what we were there for again so I said “afternoon tea, we have booked a table”. We are then told they are just getting our table ready so just a few more minutes. 

Another ten minutes past and the two lady’s at the bar are still ignoring us and standing having a chat, eventually (30 minutes after us arriving) the lady comes out and asks why we are there-again?? And then said she can’t find my voucher on the system? I never mentioned anything about a voucher all I said was we are here for afternoon tea and I have booked a table??? Anyway we eventually get told to come through to the restaurant and the lady says “we don’t actually have a table for 6, so is here okay?” And points to a sofa with a low table, not really suitable for an afternoon tea but by this point we just wanted to get started. So we sit down and wait, and wait a bit more, there’s no menus or anything for us to look at. The lady come back and tells us what you get included which felt more like a drill speech “3 cups of tea each. After that you will be charged. 5 sandwiches each after that you will be charged. etc etc”

Anyway we all order and are waiting, about 10 minutes later she comes back and tells us that she couldn’t find our booking on the system and the chef doesn’t have enough food so is trying to see what he can put together for us so will have to get back to us on if we can have the afternoon tea or not.

By this point we had already been there for an hour and Hadn’t even had a drink! the thought of waiting longer for the chef to scrape together the left overs on the back of the fridge for £35 each + extra charges for an extra sugar cube was not  something that I was willing to do. It ruined what should have been a great experience.

It was just shocking.",1,2020,08,03
119,Evening Ruined,"I booked this hotel as a date night kid-free treat for my wife after dealing with the kids during lockdown for so long.  We booked an executive river view room.

We pre-booked a table in the bar as advised due to their restaurant being closed at the moment.  We arrived at the bar at 8pm.  We ordered some simple bar snacks as a starter (prawns and chicken wings).  We waited 1.5 hours and nothing came out.  We and other tables were asking about the food and kept getting fobbed off about it coming and you could see no enquiries back to the kitchen were being made to back their claims that it was coming.  We had to walk out in the end.  Even if we could eat the setting is a bar setting with arm chairs and low tables, you cannot easily eat comfortably like that.  In the end we had to walk out and took a look at local restaurants but nothing took our fancy at such a late time and we gave up on dinner and went to our room.

On returning to our room, the temperature was a sweltering 26°C.  We tried to turn the temperature down but it kept reverting back to 26°C.  I went out to reception and rather than offering to look at it, they offered a fan or eventually a downgraded room.  Nobody wanted to come and take a look.  Instead we opted to turn the air con off completely and open the door to cool the room down quickly.

I then asked, if we ordered room service will we actually get it based upon our experience in the bar.  I was then told they were forced to close the kitchen early. Last food orders were meant to be at 10pm, it was pre-10pm when I enquired.

So our romantic night turned into a hot room and a late night 5 guys burger delivery.

The following morning was not any better with a 45 minute wait for breakfast, the order came out wrong and wait staff were running around with food in the hands, not knowing who it was meant for.

I was offered a 20% discount on check out but I wished we hadn't bothered going at all.  What was meant to be a romantic treat ended up becoming a stressful ordeal.  Not the standard I expect for such an expensive hotel.",1,2020,08,03
119,Fantastic hotel,"Been here twice now with my husband as a nice night away and to visit surrounding area. Really lovely hotel 1st time we stayed we had an executive room which had a balcony, immaculately clean and had everything we needed in the room including a fridge and coffee machine,we had the ""in room dinning ""package which was 3 course meal and breakfast, dinner was lovely and breakfast was the best breakfast we've ever had in a hotel!couple of weeks after we stayed again and got a classic dockview room with breakfast and was upgraded to Riverview which was a great view, the staff are very polite and helpful,on out 2nd visit the coffee machine didn't work,I reported this to front desk and within minutes someone came to fix it.Nothing is too much for the staff and can't thank Algirdas and Stella in reservations,their customer service was first class!I would recommend this hotel to any having a night away or longer its a fantastic hotel with lovely staff.",5,2020,08,01
119,Excellent ,"Stayed at this amazing Yacht hotel for 3 nights. We originally booked an Executive Dock view room but decided that we wanted to upgrade to an Executive River View room when we arrived. The staff were very polite and showed us into the bar area to have a drink while we waited for the room to be ready for us. The room was ready very quickly and it was extremely clean with an amazing view. We had the continental breakfast everyday in our room and the service was very quick and contactless. Overall, it was an excellent stay and I would recommend this to anyone who wants a 5* service",5,2020,07,31
119,Surprise birthday trip,"I booked a two night stay on Sunborn as part of a birthday surprise for my wife.

I chose Sunborn initially as it is some thing different. 

It is very easy to find, however due to its location. You cannot drive directly to it. We parked about 10 minute walk away. 

On arrival we were greeted warmly. Due to current climate, social distancing is in place. There are screens at reception and hand sanitiser located around the public areas.

We arrived early due to me getting check in times wrong, but we were allowed to check in and get into our cabin early. 

Our cabin was very spacious and clean. We had a dockside view. Overlooking the excel centre. The room has the basic amenities that you’d expect. Tea/coffee, hair dryer, iron. The reception staff advised that due to restrictions on staff coming into rooms during our staff, if we needed anything further, such as more towels, then simple ring room service.

We had drinks in the lounge. Some great views from the deck towards the O2 arena and Canary Wharf. 

Overall the staff were very friendly and prompt in serving us.

We didn’t eat evening meals on board as we had planned as part of our visit to eat our, there are several restaurants in the surround area, all looked pleasant and were open for business. There are also shops and chemists in the local area. 

We ate breakfast in our cabin. Breakfast can be ordered from the iPad in your cabin along with other room service options. 

The yacht is only a few minutes walk from the Docklands light rail (DLR) which has regular services to Canning Town 1 stop, where you can pick up the underground (Jubilee line) into central London. 

The emirates airline cable cars are also just a few minutes walk from the yacht which offers a cheap, novel way to cross the river over to the O2 arena and restaurants and bars. ",4,2020,07,29
119,Lovely and unique ,"The Sunborn Yacht was lovely and a unique place to stay. There is lots to do in the area, including the cable cars (to the O2) and the excel centre is just opposite the yacht. The room and bed were big and very comfortable! I would definitely stay here again ",4,2020,07,29
119,Very poor,"Booked this for my wife’s 50th birthday but such a let down. First no water or robe and slippers in room as advertised. Spoke to reception but told due to covid they were not available. That’s fine but tell me that when I book. Then waited 50 mins for our main course which was £23-50 and consisted of half a chicken breast mash and broccoli. Really??
Then asked for more coffee pods as only 2 in the room and was met by a horrendously rude receptionist who stated ‘You drink too much coffee’. Then we waited 1 hour and 25 mins for our breakfast by which time we had missed our checkout time. To be fair the staff were lovely and gave us an extra hour to check out but all in all it wasn’t a good experience and I wouldn’t recommend this hotel at all. The staff, apart from the rude receptionist were very friendly but you could hear the conversations between them stating things weren’t good at the hotel. 
Very poor",2,2020,07,28
119,Gorgeous hotel.,"Room was pricey but we definitely got what we paid for!
Room was huge and was immaculate inside.
Staff were very friendly and welcoming, There was a certain gentleman who served us a lot of the day, we didnt get his name but he was amazing - nothing was too much trouble for him. 
Sitting on the deck with a cocktail at night over looking canary wharf was my favourite part!",5,2020,07,28
119," Not so sunny at the sunborn 😕","My 27th wedding anniversary treat for my wife and I.
Upgraded my original booking at an extra cost of £60 so a total cost of £239.00.
Was expecting a mini bar as well as bath robes and slippers but mini bar was empty and no robe or slippers.i asked for the robe and slippers and was promised they would be in my room upon my return from eating out but nothing in my Room when I got back.
Also no bottled water and although there was coffee making facilities there was no coffee pods to put in the machine.
Was told to book breakfast on the iPad before 10pm so I did this and requested it to be delivered at 10AM the following morning.at 10.20 I had to go to reception and remind them of my breakfast booking and the breakfast eventually arrived at 10.40 so had to rush breakfast as we had to check out at 1100.
At checkout they tried to charge me another £60 for my upgrade even though I had already paid for it at check in along with a £40 room deposit which I’m still waiting to be returned to my card.
In all honesty my previous visits to this hotel have always gone well but on this occasion I don’t think the upgrade was really worth it especially when the items promised on the web site was not delivered.
Yes I may stay here again but very much doubt I would bother with the upgrade.
Room was half the size of previous bookings so unless your a smoker you don’t really need the balcony.",3,2020,07,25
119,Not the 5* experience expected!!!,"Fully appreciate covid-19 impact but no excuse for bad service!!
No personalisation when checking in, staff looked a mess, no water in room, breakfast wait was an hour & served in plastic tray - cold & soggy with no apology or care tbh. Joined a queue of visitors complaining at reception, but staff didn’t show any concerns for issues - very blasé.  Extremely disappointed as special occasion & not cheap. Would not recommend ☹️",1,2020,07,24
119,Huge Let down ,"I booked Sunborn London as a surprise birthday treat for my partner's 50th birthday. We stayed in room 2044 in the lower deck with a river view. Reception was quick, efficient and pleasant. On entering the room there was a very unpleasant musky smell to the room. The room was also very hot.  We called reception about the smell of the room and they did send housekeeping, who did attend a sprayed air freshener. This clearly was insufficient. This was a lower deck room which had a broken AC unit and no windows for natural fresh air. The room smelt hot and sweaty.  Not pleasant or welcoming at all. The AC unit was broken and could not go down at all. It was stuck on 28c all night. We turned it off but the room was stuffy, hot and musky.  We eventually called reception to complain and they sent us a fan.  The fan was not sufficient in bringing down the heat in the room and just circulated the hot and stuffy heat.  Actually we would have appreciated a room change, but this was never offered. We then ordered breakfast on the tablet (due to social distancing) and ordered a continental breakfast and Eggs Royal for 8.30am.  At 7.00am we were woken up to two trays of full English breakfast which we had not ordered. I called back reception to question why this happened and they apologised and said they would send us what we had originally ordered. What they failed to tell us is that they were sending the new order at the original booked time of 8.30am even though they had woke us up already at 7.00am. By the time the breakfast had arrived at 8.13am, we were showered, dressed and ready to leave, which we did. When we were at the front desk  we were asked did we enjoy our stay? We informed the front desk of our night of misery of being in a hot and musky room which left us unable to sleep the entire night. We went as far to explain that is why we were leaving so early as we were knackered after not being able to sleep all night and just felt it better to go home. The gentleman on the front desk apologised, took our room number and said thanks .....I'll get the AC fixed. How that was in any shape or form a resolution or even an acknowledgment of our night of misery, I do not know. I felt terribly let down and disappointed for my partner. We are fully aware of the circumstances of Covid 19 and that hotels have just opened backed up but I feel like there was no effort at all to take ownership and responsibility for their mishaps.  Also I am aware this was one of the hotels that was still up and running to support key workers, so they should have had things up and running. I felt the service provided did not meet my expectations for Sunborn. I have always wanted to stay at the London site and then wanted to go onto the Gibraltar site.  Unfortunately, after my experience, this will not happened.",2,2020,07,19
119,Hubbys 40th,"Really disappointed :-( booked this for a birthday gift for my husbands 40th from the start waiting for our room to be ready , we heard nothing but complaints ! Concerned I asked about this as I wanted our wkend to be special , they assured me it was minor , we had to wait over half hr for a drink , so we went out for a walk to come bk and there was huge que outside yacht of people waitin to check in we stood in.que for ages I phoned the yacht t explain we already checked in.and had a table booked and was running late we was told we had to wait in que as only 1 access ,then waited ages for food and drinks , then told t pre book breakfast so we did 9am.  still waiting at 9.45am nxt morning been down to ask and its not even done yet ? , its been.so frustrating weve spent half of my husbands special day waiting & waiting again ! .
Staff are very polite but they just can not cope very very disappointed to say the least .",2,2020,07,19
119,Afternoon tea,"We are celebrated my daughter birthday party on July, 15. We bought a voucher and booked a table in advance. The first surprise was, that our table was in a bar zone. Ok, they explained to us that the restaurant is still closed due to Covid-19. 
From the beginning, it was some refurbishment works at the main foyer. We were met there by a waitress Titania, who led us to the table. 
The second surprise was that the usual afternoon tea was served inboxes (nobody warned us about it). 
Titania was only the person who explained to us everything, even she was so careful with details (few of us were vegetarian and she offered the best options for them). We gave 4* just because o her, because then there was another waitress (with no name tag at all) who didn't care about us. 
Eventually, we were satisfied, but there is still an understatement. You have to tell that you are making afternoon tea at the bar zone and it comes in the boxes.

Kind regards, 
Sarah",4,2020,07,16
119,10 year anniversary ,"Enjoyed staying at this unusual London hotel, we booked one of the executive river view suites but both of us agree it didn’t feel very “executive “  . we had to request the robes and slippers which were supposed to be included in the room when we received them they were very small not very luxurious and had been through lots of washes.  Never received the compliantly water and the room was clean generally but had lots of dust over the head board and tv was covered. Considering this is COVID TIMES  the room would of been spotless.  
The full English breakfast we had in our room on the Saturday morning was very good, plenty of it and liked the little extras like pot of jam along with a choice of sauces etc.  But Sunday was very different, the breakfast arrived cold, the toast was barely shown the toaster very anaemic.  No side plates, no jam or extra sauces just felt very different service to what we had received on the Saturday. 
Staff were very helpful and approachable but we felt we had to ask all the time for what should of been included. We appreciate these are slightly different times but some of this are the basics.  Overall really like this hotel, the location is fabulous waking up being on the river was a fantastic experience. ",3,2020,07,13
119,Absolutely amazing,"Fantastic staff, beautiful room, amazing view. Our booking went ahead as my partner is a key worker. We had a continental breakfast that we took to our room and ate on the balcony. Walking distance to cable cars which go into the o2 if you have tickets booked.",5,2020,06,09

119,Very poor customer service,"I had a booking for one night booked along with a evening at Mama Mia The Party.  Quite rightly Mama Mia are re scheduling the event!!!!

119,Amazing afternoon tea treat,"My boyfriend booked afternoon tea for us both on our visit to London as a present for my 21st. We were tight on time arriving and we called in to say we were going to be 10 minutes late worried we weren’t going to make the booking. Luckily the staff were absolutely understanding and accommodating on the phone and upon our arrival.

The afternoon tea was lovely, filled with different sandwiches and cakes to try and a little chocolate saying happy birthday was a nice touch. We ultimately couldn’t finish the three tiers even though we wanted to.

Although it was miserable day outside it was friendly and welcoming inside with a beautiful interior and with friendly staff who were happy to take our photo. 

Overall, a lovely visit and would definitely come again for an overnight stay or a dinner reservation!",5,2020,03,17
119,Ok little overpriced and few issues ,"We had a nice stay here, pleasant friendly staff, on the whole the rooms were clean and well equipped, with the exception of the bathroom which still had toothpaste in the sink and dirty glasses, there was also only one towel despite two of us staying there, the rooms (especially bathroom)were uncomfortably hot and the aircon was very temperamental so we didn’t get much sleep due to being far too hot and breakfast was nothing special and a little disconcerting that guests were allowed in the breakfast restaurant wearing pyjamas!!! Not sure we would return. ",3,2020,03,16
119,Super swanky stay,"We stayed at the Sunborn Yacht Hotel for one night while attending a concert at the O2.
From the minute we arrived at reception we were extremely impressed with the service & the beautifully stylish  design of the hotel
Having stayed at the sister Hotel Sunborn Gibraltar (which is a larger hotel, more a cruise ship than a super yacht) we were surprised by the size of both the room (we had a standard river view room) & the social areas.
Our room was classically furnished with a super comfy bed & stylish bathroom.
We ate in the bar before we travelled to the show, & sampled 'several' delish cocktails when we returned.
Would have liked an extra night on board to have tried the main restaurant & would definitely book again when we next go to the O2.",5,2020,03,15
119,Loved it,"Spent a night at the Sunborn for our Wedding Anniversary.

119,Afternoon Tea ,"Had a lovely afternoon on the yacht, food very nice, sandwich selection, two little scones with jam & clotted cream, mini patisserie, nice strong cuppa & a glass of fizz.  The service was very good - Hassan was a very good host.  The yacht is immaculate.  All in all a very nice afternoon.",5,2020,03,13
119,Perfect,"A fantastic stay on this beautiful yacht...... our only regret is that it was for just one night. I would throughly recommend this to anyone. The rooms were beautiful,  the service was good and the cocktails were delicious!",5,2020,03,09
119,Treat for husbands birthday!,"From start to finish, our stay was 5*. We had an issue with our reservation whereby our upgrade hadn’t been actioned. Sarah on reception worked swiftly and smoothly to ensure that this was resolved and did so with patience, humour and positivity. A huge thank you to you Sarah! Your customer service skills are second to none.
The whole yacht was immaculately clean, including our cabin. 
The sundown bar is perfect for cocktails, watching the sun going down. We didn’t eat in here, but the bar menu looked good.
We dined in The Lands End restaurant and both the service and food were impeccable. We had steak tartare, lobster and crab ravioli and Côte du boeuf to share. Cheese and biscuits finished off the meal perfectly. Our son had chicken, salad and fries and apple and pear crumble with custard. Ask for a table next to a window.
We booked a cabin with a river view balcony - and I would highly recommend the same type of room. The view of the Docklands at night is stunning.
Breakfast the next morning was also delightful. At £19.50 pp, we hoped for a good selection and we were not disappointed! Delicious produce and all freshly cooked, despite it being a buffet.
We were sad to leave and will return!",5,2020,03,08
119,Beautiful .......,"Stayed here as a treat for my birthday. Staff were friendly, room was very spacious a lot better than the usual hotel stays in London and far more spacious than your typical room on a cruise .bed was large and very comfy. Bathroom was lovely very warm a shower was great too along with lovely thick fluffy towels. Would highly recommend and will definitely return",5,2020,03,06
119,A titanic place to stay if ya down london way!,"This was great fun, right next to Excel arena.  So not what you’d choose for a romantic trip away.  

Although there’s some great places to eat across from where the Yacht is moored as well as a pub and a Cable Car ride over the river to the city.  

Inside this massive Yacht is a totally wild trip back to what it busy have been like travelling the ocean in style decades ago. 

It has a chic 40s kinda feel to the decor and all the rooms look like a little dated. But in a charming and comfortable way. 

Massive bed in the suite I had and the service from all the staff from the moment you check in was simply Exceptional. 

Shower and bathroom was small but well planned out.  Shower was a bit old school but worked well.   

TV was great and the view over the river at sunrise was stunning. 

You won’t need to worry about sea sickness or anything.  You’d never even know you was on the water as the boat is totally fixed to the dock. 

If you are looking to pamper yourself or just some thing different when looking for a bed when on business.  Absolutely give this a look. 

Great bar and restaurant.  Not a cheap eat, but well worth every penny.

119,A stay to meet up with the family,"We really loved the ambience, the room and the staff. We did feel that there were too many noisy children and wondered if the other lift ever worked?

Attached a photo of the most expensive coffee I’ve ever had but who knows I’m in the City later,"It’s not too handy unless you’re at ExCel but I liked to come here when there’s nothing on there! I don’t mind the DLR into city so everything was going well till this visit. Checked in and found the coffee machine didn’t work; after inserting all my pods!! the safe didn’t work either so I’ve been carrying my iPad all over. I complained and Leonardo fixed the coffee machine and promised me more pods. Perfect I thought. He couldn’t fix the safe but told me it would be looked at. So I went to have a coffee in the bar!!!! £4.50 for an Americano; despite me asking for a filter which they don’t do anyway. Wow even the city would challenge that price. It’s a record for me. Second to Rome which is an achievement. I’m here for another day but I won’t be back again. 

I should say though that the room was immaculate and cleaned thoroughly. A good test that when I spilled the tea! On the floor and wiped it up the tissue wasn’t dirty!",3,2020,02,26
119,Beautiful hotel,"We had an amazing time staying on the Sunborne.
All the staff were extremely kind and helpful,and in particular Francisco the hotel manager, who gave us a complimentary upgrade as we were celebrating an anniversary.
The Yacht is a clean and stylish place to stay, and is really convenient to the O2 and many other tourist attractions, not to mention the ExCel arena.
A fantastic stay, in a fantastic hotel.",5,2020,02,25
119,Stunning! A unique experience,"I treated my husband to a night on the Sunblurn for his 40th birthday. It wasn’t the cheapest hotel but it was worth every single penny. The staff and facilities are all very high quality and the food and drink divine. I would have no issues paying the same again and returning.
The rooms were huge and well decorated as was the bar and restaurant.",5,2020,02,24
119,Amazing ,I called as my partner birthday wen we arrived we was upgraded from the moment we checked in tbe staff was amazing so friendly nothing was ro much trouble the room was clean a birthday treat waiting we went for drinks in the day and had a meal in the night we never left the boat no need to such a lovely night and again can’t thank the staff enough they wete amazing everything was perfect can not fault it at all going to book with friends and try in the summer thank u ,5,2020,02,24
119,Perfect stay,When we walked on the yacht after being windswept and greeted by Ilona it was wonderful and our perfect stay began. We were celebrating joint 60th’s and got an upgrade to river view and wine and chocolates we felt so special. This yacht is a great place and we will definetely return. ,5,2020,02,23
119,Good quality but needs more facilities ,"My wife and I visited the Sunborn yacht on the 18th Feb as a one night stay for her birthday. Firstly I would say that the arrival and booking in process was flawless and we were treated very well. To be fair it was very quiet but nonetheless it was quick and professional. The room was very big and to a high standard which was nice, especially as it was a basic (Groupon) room. However the bathroom was very small and did not have a bath. I think for £162 per night you should be able to take a bath! The reason this hotel only got four stars is that there should need more facilities on board. At least a small gym, pool or spa would be nice. Due to this we found ourselves spending most of the time of the boat. Mind you, if that is what you are looking for - a nice place to stay to get to the ExCel or O2 etc - then this place ticks all the boxes. If you are looking for nice places to eat, just cross the way to the converted Warehouses and you will find a great deal of choice on offer. Overall a nice hotel with quality fittings and service, but more of a stop off as opposed to a place to fully relax and enjoy. ",4,2020,02,20
119,Short break,"First impressions on arriving at the location were muted! Told to park (via e-mail) in the nearest NCP car park, that’s ok, but not knowing the area a simple sign or note on the website on how to Get from the car park to the hotel would have been useful! Guessing correctly it only took a few minutes to get to the yacht. The checkin was smooth & efficient . The room was nice if a little sparse for a 4* hotel. We dined in the restaurant and again, the service was exceptional, Mario was excellent. The food was very nice ( that’s about all I can say about it). The bar is VERY expensive, even for London! £14 for a gin & tonic and almost £7 for a lager. The bed was very comfortable and we both slept well. The breakfast was very good and plentiful. 
The yacht hotel is a unique place for a break or if you are visiting the Excel or you’re flying from London City airport.
All in all a really nice break, but could do better (maybe some sort of entertainment, a piano and singer in the bar?)

119,One night stay,"Stayed here with my daughter after we went to the theatre in town.
Arrived really late, but the staff were great, friendly and cheerful.
Our room was lovely and we had a River view of the O2 arena and along the Thames.
Had a balcony, so we could sit outside.
The beds were large and comfortable.Had breakfast delivered to the room for a cost of £5.
Only wish we had more time to stay in the hotel.
Will return and stay again.",5,2020,02,18
119,Fabulous!,"We stayed here last year for the MCN show at the Excel, so it was our first choice for this years event.
Everything was perfect, the storm didnt spoil anything. The staff are so lovely and friendly, the food is superb, and it's just a little bit of luxury! We will be back. Thank you to everyone. Beautiful hotel!",5,2020,02,16
119,Fab night away,"Myself and my partner had this booked since December for a little valentines get away. Apart from the awful storm that hit that day we had a fabulous stay, the cocktails tasted stunning ! Very clean and the staff were all very friendly, only downside was the restaurant food was abit too fancy for me but still tasted good. Over all Myself and my partner left very impressed.",4,2020,02,16

119,Luxury stay,"We loved our stay here! Down as a birthday trip / to see Mamma Mia the party. Ideal for the O2, we went across on the emirates cable car which was so handy. The room was so lovely with a river view. We enjoyed afternoon tea when we arrived which was so tasty with LP CHAMPAGNE flights :-) the massage on our check out was lovely, just could have done with the blinds shut as it was quite bright!

119,Amazing ,"Just returned from a three day trip abroad the Sunborn.The moment we walked through the entrance we were greeted by a warm and friendly welcome,asking if we had booked for a special occasion telling them it was our anniversary the lovely young lady upgraded us to a balcony room.The room itself was beautiful everything to a very high standard and spotless. The breakfast was fantastic. After reading a few negative reviews I was going with an open mind,but what do some people want ?,I could not fault anything lovely staff ,lovely accommodation, could recommend to anyone ",5,2020,02,11

119,Stay on 31 Jan 2020,"I sent an email to Mr Szabo one of the mangers after my stay and he has still yet to respond. 
I don’t like leaving negative feedback but sometimes these hotels have to take responsibility for their guests not having  an enjoyable stay. 
We had noise in our room from 10pm until 3am 
We had a room under the bar and nobody informed us that we would be kept awake all night. 
Please check if you are staying there in the future where your room is located if you want a good nights sleep. This is a unique hotel and worth staying at but it is only as good as the staff running it.",3,2020,02,07
119,Wonderful and quirky! ,"We stayed at the Sunborn London for 2 nights whilst we went to the NTA’s. The hotel is quirky and not like anything we had stayed in before. The reception staircase was beautiful and we got a warm welcome from the reception staff with the added bonus of an upgrade to an executive suite.
The room was very spacious and styled as a boat cabin with wooden features. We had a lounge area as well as the bedroom and a small balcony. We ordered room service on the bedrooms iPad and it arrived promptly and the food was delicious. There wasn’t much choice on the usual menu for room service and the bar. 
The staff were all friendly and couldn’t  do enough for us. 
The location was perfect! A few minutes walk to the emirates skyline which is a five minute ride over the Thames to the O2. I would definitely come back here in a heartbeat and will be recommending the Sunborn ",5,2020,02,05
119,Don’t Bother,"I booked this hotel via Groupon for my husbands birthday. I contacted the hotel to pay extra for a room upgrade - dont bother! I also paid extra to have banners and balloons in the room they allowed me choose the colour I picked blue. Arrived in the room and was silver and pink with flamingos not impressed as you can imagine! The room was not very clean. I booked my husband a facial in the spa, very poor facial which was a shame as he was really looking forward to that. There were many loud noises that we could hear from the room whilst staying and also a training group that appeared only to talk in foul language. I booked a table in the restaurant for a birthday meal, food was standard not what I was expecting and not very hot at all. The lifts were not working properly. My key card to get through doors wasn’t working properly went to reception for assistance and all they said was to keep trying, no help at all. The bar and bar food was very expensive for what it was. I asked the restaurant manager if they could do a happy birthday plate they said they couldn’t just do it and that we would have to order a pudding in order for them to do it, just rude. We actually didn’t like anything on the pudding menu and after having mediocre food we didn’t want to order dessert. We spent a lot of money at this hotel only to have in return a spoilt birthday. I did contact Francisco the hotel manager and he did process a refund of £150. However, this doesn’t compensate enough for the issues we had and we will never get this special birthday back. We have stayed at the sunborn Gibraltar and that was amazing unfortunately the same standard isn’t reflected in London. Shame. Thanks again for making my husbands birthday one to remember for the wrong reasons. ",1,2020,02,05
119,Amazing@,"We stayed here for my birthday & what a treat it was. The rooms are spacious in a personal suite style & spotless. The bed large & comfortable, the breakfast delicious & well organised &, the location stunning. We had a very helpful guy overseeing reception  who let us check in earlier as we got there before 3pm. Cannot fault, a unique experience & will definitely be back. Thanks ",5,2020,02,02
119,Disappointment  ,"Cancellation made on the 4th October due to family emergency and it has taken until 2 days ago to be told ‘your reservation was in the past we can no longer make adjustments  my partner telephoned the day before  and explained the circumstances  and we were redirected back to groupon and after speaking with them they advised that it would be down to the hotels discretion, but due to circumstances thought that would honour an alternative date alas no, £160 wasted !! ",1,2020,02,01
119,Very convenient stay for the O2,"Booked a river view room with breakfast. Room very spacious and well appointed. Lots of mirrors and plugs (UK and Europe) and all in the right places. Great hot powerful shower and great view from the room. Staff were amazing from the moment we arrived to checkout. Nothing was too much trouble. I'm very surprised at some of these negative reviews as we had 5* service. I agree the drinks are pricey but definitely in line with London and all major cities I have visited. Breakfast was a delight. A very warm greeting and a lovely table with a river view. A vast choice of meats and fruit and a good selection of hot foods too. Not much cereal choice but wasn't the end of the world. My husband had an omelette cooked to order and we were politely told there may be a wait as cook was very busy with room service orders, however it came quickly and was very good. We were also offered poached eggs if would like them. Although some items did run out, this is inevitable in a large busy hotel, they were replaced quickly. Very close to the O2, cable car is fabulous so I recommend that. My only gripe was the room was not as clean as it should have been. Floor was quite dusty as were some of the surfaces. Bathroom was spotless. But that's it. Good value for it's location and top marks to the staff. Yes we would stay again. Thanks for looking after us so well.",4,2020,01,30
119,Birthday stay,"We stayed on this ship near the Excell, which is a unique place to stay in London. The cabins are very well appointed and extremely comfortable. The breakfast in the morning was excellent, will definitely return.",4,2020,01,29
119,Stay over night,Very friendly personal and helpful. The breakfast menu was very good. We had huge room with the balcony as well. Very nice place stay over night or have the drinks with friends in the pub. Highly recommended ,5,2020,01,27
119,Afternoon tea. What afternoon tea?,"This is my second review of this property which I had previously visited for a massage and afternoon tea. After an enjoyable afternoon tea, my daughter decided to book this as a Christmas gift which we attended today 22/01/20..After the booking was made, my daughter was contacted by a member of staff enquiring whether our request for no red meat or cheese was a preference or an allergy. Firstly, if we have made a request, I would expect that this would be considered and not questioned. Neither of us eat red meat or cheese. During the call, my daughter was advised that the menu had been changed and they had a new chef. We had the same problem on the last occasion where the sandwich choices were very limited. However, Salomey, the waitress managed to get the chef to prepare chicken and salmon sandwiches that were absolutely lovely. 

Despite being told that the menu had changed, on arrival we were presented with the menu that was a carbon copy of the one we had seen on the last occasion. However I was not overly concerned as I thought that having received a call, our requests had been taken into consideration. I was disappointed to find that although they confirmed that they had received the notification, no alternatives were offered. The choices were ham, cheese, cucumber with yoghurt, salmon with cream cheese and egg mayonnaise. We queried this and Salomey was our waitress again and she offered to find out whether the chef would provide an alternative. She returned and offered us tofu and falafel which we refused. We both dislike tofu and whilst I don't mind falafel, I don't want it in a sandwich. She returned a short while later and said the chef had asked us what we wanted and we indicated that the salmon was not a problem and we were happy to have chicken. Nevertheless, this also appeared to be a problem as another member of staff came to us saying he had been dealing with an event and was not from the afternoon section. It was made clear to us that they did not offer red meat on their menu. Well I beg to differ as ham is red meat. We were also told that the chef was not prepared to adapt the sandwiches for us and also that their menus are online. We were then offered a vegetarian option which we refused, I am fed up with being offered a vegetarian option whenever I decline red meat. Consequently we decided to leave.

I was extremely disappointed with the attitude of the member of staff that apparently came over to assist us. We were made to feel that we were being difficult and unappreciative of the help he was offering. The afternoon tea was not cheap and we were not prepared to spend upwards of £70 to eat only half of what they were offering. No options were offered to give us the salmon without the cheese.

We had ordered two glasses of water but when we attempted to pay, Salomey ensured that we received these on the house. Thanks Salomey for going above and beyond yet again. Unfortunately because of our experience, I would not
consider returning to Sunborn. This was a big let down both because we missed out on our afternoon tea, the sandwich menu is limited, and the attitude of the staff did not make us feel like a valued customer, were unwilling to accommodate our dietary requirements or offer us any incentive to want to return.

When my last review was submitted, the manager responded saying that my comments would be passed to the management team to improve their services in the future. Clearly this has not happened.",1,2020,01,25
119,Overnight stay,"Stayed here on Saturday evening, lovely room overlooking the river with balcony.  We checked in early and was able to leave our luggage with them whilst we went to our show.  Parking round the corner at £20 for 24 hours.
The only downside of this place was the service was not great.  We waited over 20 minutes for a drink in the bar, then for another waiter to come back to us saying the earlier waiter didn't understand what we wanted!  Breakfast we had to wait for a table too!",4,2020,01,22
119,"Awful experience, awful massage!","Dear Sunbourn Hotel,

I emailed last week prior taking my review to TripAdvisor, however no one bothered acknowledging my email, not even the manager! 

Purchased as a gift, including massages we checked in to Subourn yesterday, Saturday 18th January. Although we requested a river view this was not given on arrival, appreciating this is not always possible. We did ask at reception if one was available, which there was. They very kindly moved us over. The reception team can I say where very friendly, helpful and accommodating. 
We received our pre booked massages at 4pm yesterday. A spa manager myself in Kensington I was very much looking forward to this treat and can I add my treatment was lovely! My partners however rated his treatment 1/10! Just awful. Being in the industry we are both fortunate enough to receive spa treatments on a regular basis and he described his ‘as a 10 year old giving him a massage’ and within minutes he wanted to leave. At one stage the therapist was belching, which she did apologise for. 

On returning to the room, having a shower and getting changed we made our way to 3rd floor bar. Ordered a drink and sat in the lounge. There was a noisy group of 8 guests disturbing the rest of the lounge ranting and singing. We was quick to take our drink to the reception foyer alongside other guests complaining. Can I just add, we are a young couple and enjoy a loud atmosphere, however this I can only describe as football ground chanting! 

We then proceeded to dinner in the restaurant which was full and we didn’t make a reservation. Restaurant full to hotel guests?? Without asking on check in ‘will you be eating with us this evening, so we can reserve a table for you?’ or ‘our restaurant does get booked up, we advise booking should you wish to dine with us this evening!’. We had no other choice than to leave the hotel to and make alternative plans. 

Extremely disappointed with our stay and certainly wouldn’t recommend to anyone!",1,2020,01,22
119,A real treat,"Our short stay on the ‘yacht’ was a real pleasure

We were lucky to be upgraded to one of the junior suites with a balcony overlooking the water and a complimentary stocked minibar.

We only had bar snacks in the evening and I heartily recommend the sticky wings which were delicious

Breakfast was great with a full range for the ‘Full English’ and plenty of other choices if you prefer a lighter start to the day",5,2020,01,21
119,Great location and food is so good,"Stayed at the Yacht Hotel to attend a show at the ExCel, its only a 5 min walk away, as is the closest DLR station, and Emirates cable cars. There is also some bars, restaurants, and Tesco Express all within the same distance. So yes, great location.

The hotel itself is so lovely, really nice lobby area to chill out, great bar and seating area for evening drinks, and a winding staircase to the upper level. Lots of space in the hotel room, with the balcony a bonus on a nice day.

A must do is food from the on site restaurant, and evening drinks at the bar.

Would definitely recommend, and look forward to my next stay.",4,2020,01,21
119,Lovely stay,"Just stayed for the weekend with my wife as a short break.
Very unique hotel and nice atmosphere. The room we had was very nice, quite large with a small balcony.
Overall would recommend, just feel it was slightly expensive.",4,2020,01,19
119,Sightseeing. ,"What a lovely place to stay. Our room had a balcony looking over the docks and a good size shower room. Lovely sunrise. 
Staff was very helpful including printing tickets off for the shard. 
We have stayed on 3 cruise ships before and this is just what we expected. Very clean and breakfast was lovely. 
If we returned to London I would definitely return. ",5,2020,01,19
119,Good not excellent ,"We received this as a Xmas present, it was in groupon, an overnight stay with breakfast.
The ship is nicely decorated and the bedrooms/cabins spacious, ours faced the Thames. 
We had a drink in the bar and went for dinner, they were still serving the Xmas menu, slightly disappointed as I wanted the much advertised scotch egg.
Dinner was nice and the trifle was excellent.
We had another drink in the bar then went to bed.
I was disappointed that 2 beds had been pushed together and I kept going in the dip then had to push the beds back together 
I would rate this 3 and half stars",3,2020,01,16
119,Nice treat ,"Overall a lovely experience at the Sunborn.
We had a pleasant stay however the air conditioning didnt work in the room, and being on a boat the windows don't open. Also I kept stubbing my toe on the small step into the bathroom.
An exciting place to stay, with the novelty of being on a boat. It was so convenient being just a short walk from the Emirates Air Line, a fun way to get across the river!",4,2020,01,14
119,Fabulous after Christmas treat,"I booked this trip for my parents on groupon as a holiday present and they loved it. 
-Very good sized rooms and amazing views. Beautiful decorations and overall lovely hotel. 
-The staff were a little unhelpful but the ship itself was lovely. Breakfast staff were much nicer!
-They only told us after we booked that the spa would be closed but didn’t refund us or let us know this before hand. -The breakfast was a standard continental.
- They stayed for the weekend but would have wanted a bit longer to explore the sites in walking distance.",4,2020,01,11
119,Good experience but....,"We stayed at the Sunborn between CHristmas and New Year for 2 nights, on arrival only 1 lift was working. Our rooms weren't ready so we asked to leave our luggage which we did and went for a drink in the bar, the service was a bit slow as there was only one staff member on duty. When our room became available we expected our luggage to be taken to the room but unfortunately this wasn't an option. The rooms were of a good size and the bed comfortable, the sofa had seen better days and was very worn. We returned at midnight and were unable to get room service or food from the bar. The next morning we were told by the restaurant staff that there was no milk!!",3,2020,01,11
119,Great Gatsby extravaganza NYE,"Hi,

I would just like to say that your new years eve extravaganza Great Gatsby evening was a scam.
I paid £605.00 to have this amazing evening with yourselves, as advertised on your website. 
Me and my partner dressed up for this Great Gatsby evening and was only allowed for the meal. Your manager wouldn't let us attended the upstairs of the Restaurant as we was not in the 'early bookers or riser' as he said. 

So me and my partner was told the bar down stairs is open for use to have a drink in. So we attended the bar where the live DJ was playing, and any tom dick and harry could walk into. 

Kids running around everywhere, me and my partner dressed up like the 1920's and everyone else dressed as normal. 
Then the so called 'DJ' has his kid playing the music and decides to play 'Baby Shark'. Now if I wanted to attend a kids party for NYE I would of and certainly would not been dressed how I was, and paid £605.00 for it.

Me and my partner left your event, went to the room packed our bags got changed and left, having to drive back to our local area.
We spent our new years in a pub as we was embarrassed to have been sold a scam by yourselves. My new year was ruined because of your false advertisement by your team. My surprise for my partner was ruined.",1,2020,01,09
119,Great place to stay,"A great venue to stay while in London, very large room with a great view of the Thames, ideal for Excel. Don’t bother with The Lands End Restaurant though!! Over priced, limited choices of food with no alternative GF available.",5,2020,01,06
119,A Christmas Nightmare,"An impressive looking floating hotel. I have stayed on board many times prior and had a wonderful experience. The staff were always very polite and friendly.

It’s was pricey because its a unique hotel which supposedly offers a touch of luxury. 

Its more novelty than luxury if truth be told. The rooms a spacious and comfortable, with big comfortable beds, but but far from luxurious. 

However, it has been favoured by me in the past, as a novelty stay when entering friends at Christmas. As my past Christmas visits have been magical.

Unfortunately, all that has changed...
This Christmas was absolutely ruined, I spent a small fortune for terrible Christmas, from start to finish.

I booked myself and 3 close family friends, from Christmas Eve to Boxing Day. 

First off, upon our arrival, only 1 of the two lifts were working. Which was a little irritating, as the working lift couldn’t cope effectively with the amount of guests using it. There being long waits for it to arrive whenever we used it.

On previous stays there were staff with hotel trollers to assist bringing luggage to the rooms. As negotiating the metal door frames in the corridors is difficult with baggage, they have raise metal floor strips. There is no one now to help, though there is one trolley to use, if you can find it.

It being the fest season I was shocked by the lack of Christmas atmosphere and how sparse the decorations were on the boat, to previous years.

Then I to pay extra on arrival, as the rooms we were given were not the ones I was expecting. I book the same rooms every time I stay onboard. Even though the boat was not fully booked, we had to pay an upgrade price, even though we were given the wrong rooms.

Upon getting the rooms we wanted, One of the upgraded rooms had a coffee machine that didn’t work properly, luke warm water was as hot as it got.

There were also problems at breakfast, which I had paid for in advance.

The maitre d wanted to charge me again. I showed her the confirmation email, but she still charged it all to my rooms and told me to sort it out when I check out. Not quite luxurious service there.

The breakfast itself was mediocre nothing impressive, certainly not a 5 star service, apart from the price of it. Had to keep asking for basic things like salt pepper and butter.

The Christmas Day meal was a disgrace and at £80 per head,  I most definitely was not impressed. Which again had to be booked in advance and in the most ridiculous and farcical way possible.

I phoned the Sunborn to book the lunch, they informed me, they could not book it over the phone. I had to go online, book and pay for it online, then call the Sunborn back with a voucher numbers.

Only then, would they book it over the phone. Absolutely ridiculous.

The Christmas lunch itself was terrible... we were told to be prompt for the booked time slot. Which we were. 

However, we were made to sit and wait for 45 minutes before we even got our starters. 

No explanation given. I had to approach the maitre d to enquire as to when we would receive our meal. 

She apologised for the delay and sent over complimentary drinks. Which was a decent thing to do.

When we were eventually got served our £80 Christmas meal it was shockingly bad. We were promised a delicious and sumptuous feast. This is in fact, what we were told:

“Make the festive season even more magical and memorable with a delicious Christmas Day meal onboard our luxurious superyacht. Enjoy sumptuous festive dishes cooked to perfection by our award-winning chef and relax amid the elegance and sophistication of our London docklands setting for only £80pp.

You’ll find an array of striking and memorable flavours this winter, an inspiring range of local and seasonal ingredients, menus and wine lists specifically curated to take you to new heights of sensory pleasures this festive season.”

This is what we actually got:

The starters were ok nothing special, I had the pate and it wasn’t bad or special. 

However, the main meal was dreadful. We were given, what I can only describe as clumps of food. 

Each of us was handed a plate, which had a couple of £2 coin sized pieces of flavourless turkey on a plate, with 1 very small carrot baton, a smearing of parsnip purée and 3 potato balls, the size of a malteser.

A bowl of so called seasonal veg, was placed in the middle of the table for the 4 of us to share.. 

It consisted of predominantly, cabbage and Kale.. we did manage to find 2 very skinny and shrivelled baby carrots in there as well as 3 brussel sprouts which were sliced into 2 halves. 3 sprouts for 4 to share, is frankly an insult.

For desert a very small serving of Christmas pudding, the size of a marshmallow, with watery custard. 

At £80 per head, that was a disgraceful Christmas lunch. I was mortified with embarrassment, that my guests were presented with that miserable excuse for food.

We ended up finding a corner shop later on and purchased sandwiches to curb our hunger.

I can’t even compliment the ambience of the stay on the boat. As there was a a family of Irish Gypsies also on board, who were very disruptive and extremely noisy.

To be fair to the staff,  who on the whole were friendly and polite, but obviously had no real experience in the hotelier business, let alone so called luxury hotelery. Were kept busy with the gypsy family, who were extremely demanding, of their attention. But they were powerless to do anything about them.

This family also spent a majority of the time of in the bar, also disturbing  the ambience for all other guests too, every day we were there.

They had screaming undisciplined children running around the bar, from early afternoon till midnight, every day... falling over furniture and kicking walls.. 

Treating the bar especially  and the rest of the boat as their person playground.

The adults sitting in two groups in the bar shouting across the room to each other and shouting orders from there seats to the bar staff, whom I felt sorry for. 

The bar staff tried to intervene to no avail. They clearly had not experience in dealing with unruly guests. So all guests had to suffer the antics and unsocial behaviour of this family.

The families unsociability included, vaping in the bar, drinking in the bar from cans of beer and bottles of spirits they brought on to the boat themselves. 

They even changed a child’s nappy in the bar and demanded that the bar staff fill up a baby bottle with warm milk.

The teenage girls from the group strolling around the bar in bathrobes and slippers. It did not make the festive season feel magical or sophisticated, it will be memorable, but not for the right reasons.

It being the Christmas Eve and Christmas day, we would have gone elsewhere to eat and drink, if there were anywhere else to escape to. 

As there was nowhere else to go we had no choice to put up with all the shenanigans on board the Sunborn.

Then upon checking out there was awful confusion, about what had been paid for and what hadn’t. 

The checkout clerk was very sympathetic and was very much aware that our stay had not been as pleasurable as before, as she enquired if we enjoyed our stay. 

She apologised vehemently and acknowledged the Irish gypsies had been a huge nuisance to them and other guests.

Late into the night of Christmas Day aprox 2am, there were doors slamming on the floor below us... people running through the boat shouting.

I have spent so many good happy times on the Sunborn especially Christmas’s.

This was a shockingly dreadful visit, it had the ambience of a Bultlin’s holiday camp, catering to Jeremy Kylie show misfits.

I spent over £900 for a stay, that I wouldn’t pay £9 for. I’m absolutely and bitterly, disappointed, not to mention, out of pocket. No recompense was offered.

More importantly I am mortally embarrassed to have given my guests that experience. I cannot undo that experience and replace it with a better one.

You have utterly let me down Sunborn and made me pay through the nose for it. 

I might as we have just thrown £900 into the street and gone to Mc Donald’s. I would have gotten better atmosphere, and value for money..

Bitterly disappointed... all the Sunborn wanted is my money, it wasn’t interested in giving the luxury service it advertises, or any service at all. Just had over your money and leave.

I was so shocked that i asked the staff is the boat under new management, they said it was not.

So what has happened Sunborn?

I’m sorry to have to say, this is no longer worth spending money on.",1,2020,01,05
119,Birthday treat,"Stayed last night , our 2nd visit , still has wow factor regarding staying some different.

Our room was water facing which is in our opinion better than looking at land .

A little disappointing to find both lifts out of use, for elderly could be a problem.

Drink at bar very expensive with limited choice.

Would book again , once a year is a nice treat.

Check on line for offers they can vary.

Also ate in restaurant , very tasty food , price matched so will definitely eat ashore next visit",4,2020,01,05
119,Short Break,"The hotel is impressive from the outside.
Getting in was a little frustrating, there are 2 lifts which you use to get to each floor of the Yacht including reception, which took sometime seen as one of them was out of action.
As you walk in the reception area the staircase is a beautiful show piece. 
Didn't entertain the idea of having drinks there though which is a shame, the prices were crazy.
The room was very spacious, full of big mirrors, seating, large comfortable bed! TV signal was a bit on the dodgy side. 
For the size of the room the bathroom size was a little disappointing but still lovely, but VERY warm and only 1 toilet roll and only 1 large towel available. 
We also got a text message reminder on our one and only night saying not to forget check out is 11, kinda felt like we were being pushed out before we had even stayed 🤣 so pretty average stay.",3,2020,01,03
119,Seeing in the New Year 2020,"This is the second time we have stayed at The Suborn and once again we had a lovely time. Our executive room with a balcony was lovely a very good size for a cabin. We booked into the early bird evening meal in the restaurant ‘The Landsdowne’ for New Year’s Eve and the service, food and ambience was truly amazing. We were offered cocktails to start and canopies which were lovely. Our starters and main were cooked to perfection ; well done chef. They organised a musician who was fabulous and we still cannot work our how he worked his magic, absolutely brilliant. We didn’t join in the evening 20s themed Great Gatsby as we quite like New Year’s Eve on our own on the balcony looking at fireworks. We did this but stayed in the bar area where there was a DJ, had a dance and went back to our cabin to see the year in. We did go back down for more champs after though 😀 a fantastic evening. We took the three day package which was lovely as New Year’s Day we ventured into London to see the NYD parade great fun. We relaxed after that until we left on the 2nd January ; a great start to 2020 after having 16 for dinner on Xmas day. Please try this yacht it’s beautiful and the staff managed so well during such a busy time. Huge congratulations to you all bar, reception, restaurant and cleaning staff did a fantastic job and we thank you. Happy New Year to you all we cannot wait to return and try the suite with the jacuzzi.",5,2020,01,03
119,Beautiful but a few let downs,"Beautiful hotel . Art Deco ( wow factor) lovely friendly staff . Huge room and very big cosy bed . 
We booked for dinner and the restaurant was beautiful but no full menu on Offer only a set menu . 
Asked for the turkey dish and was told that they didn’t have it . Asked for the trifle for desert for my husband and I but there was only one left . 
Bar was Nice but didn’t expect to see a screaming toddler running round at 10 pm . Asked for baileys and was told we don’t have any as we run out of it at Christmas. 
Maybe this is why they do so many groupon deals ., At the end of the day we had a lovely stay . It is a lovely hotel",4,2020,01,02
119,not quite as expected,"Stayed for 2 nights for a special birthday break. The breakfast is mediocre and buffet style, had to keep asking for basic items like salt, pepper and butter. on the 2nd night (sunday) we came back from a matinee about 7.30ish to have a drink in the bar. There was a rowdy table of 4 (3 women 1 man)  one of the women who was not a hotel guest but in the group kept going out the door onto the terrace to smoke and make mobile calls telling her friends how many cocktails she had consumed leaving the door open in the middle of December 2019. Then there was  unacceptable language as the man and one of the woman had a blazing row, they left , he ordered food then fell asleep in the chair the bar manager woke him up with loud clapping , then served him a bottle of champagne to take back to his room. We complained along with other guests and he said thats ok there locked in there room now. Well overpriced hotel for the level of service, wouldnt stay again.",2,2020,01,02
119,Novelty value,"Stayed for three nights including New Years Eve. Hotel is on the dockside and in the water as a novelty ‘yatch’. Our room was on the 5th floor; a good size and fitted out like you were on board ship. Good refreshment tray, coffee maker and biscuits replenished daily. Small fridge so you can have fresh milk ( I took my own ). Complimentary bottles of water. Small bathroom very warm and with the hairdryer in there secured to wall, so it is very hot when drying your hair. 
We didn’t have breakfast so can’t comment on that. Bar area can get busy and we struggled to get a table. Drinks are expensive; our two alcoholic drinks totalled £22. Also note that £40 per night stayed is taken from your debit/credit card on arrival. This appears to be ‘their policy’.
Access to hotel is via two small lifts servicing all floors. One lift out of action for the whole time we were there and no sign of anyone working to repair it. This was a little infuriating waiting for the lift as it just couldn’t cope with the volume of customers!!!! Once inside there are stairs and we used these. 
There are a few restaurants within walking distance which are ok. It’s a very quite area. Probably busier if there is an exhibition on. We did enjoy our stay.",4,2020,01,01
119,A little disappointing,"What a wonderful venue, bright modern, luxurious, truly first class. The cabins were a great size and the bed was very comfortable and had everything in them you needed. The bar and restaurant service and food was very good. The only issue were some of the other guests who spoiled or overall experience. Unruliness at the bar , with their children turning it into a playground was not great. The noise and music at 2am and 4am from other cabins was the final straw. Truly a great shame as this is a fantastic venue.  ",3,2019,12,31
119,Lovely experience,"Stayed there as a surprise birthday present and it was amazing! Loved the rooms as really gave a nautical feeling, the bar served excellent cocktails and all the staff were brilliant. The facilities were great and it really was a great experience, loved it !",5,2019,12,29
119,Short break,"I love this hotel, is very neat with great views, the staff are friendly, and I enjoyed my breakfast, but they where out of milk which was a bit disappointing, considering the standard of the hotel, I would recommend it.",4,2019,12,28
119,Suberb as usual,"This was my fifth stay on Sunborn and the second time I was given a waterside room, everything was perfect again from the comfy room to the shower with lovely large and soft towels. Down early for breakfast was able to sit in a window seat and watch dawn break over the o2 arena while the cable cars crossed the Thames and enjoyed breakfast from the extensive choices available ",5,2019,12,26
119,Underwhelmed ,"Having had sunborn london on my bucket list for a fair few years, decided to go.for 51st birthday. 

Has we approached I was struck by sound of a huge generator. This was slap bang in front of ship, roaring away to its hearts content. We arrived at lifts to find 1 out of order.

Entering ship i was quite underwhelmed by reception  area, considering it was christmas thare wasn't a wow moment. There was a christmas tree and a few garlands but nothing like I would have expected. 

Given  room number we had told them it was a special occasion been my birthday. Receptionist was not very personable just smiled and told us we were on riverside. Got to room and of course the doors on the right hand side were to the river view we were on left side with view of the factory buildings with  lights of the excel beaming videos of whoever advertises with them into our room. However the biggest and deal breaker for us was this monstrous great generator I wrote about earlier, right outside our balcony window droaning itself silly pumping electricity into the ship. 

We went back to reception, said this was not what we had ordered for my special occasion would it be possible to Change to a river view without the screaming generator. At first they said we can't change but if we don't unpack we can change for 2nd night. We asked to speak to manager. She came and to be fair she was more forth coming and she did manage to find a room on the river side. This was good we were happy now with the decent views of the dock and the skyline towards the Emirates cable cars and canary wharf. 

The room was quite spacious, however it was quite drab and brown, didn't really wow you. Bathroom was ok but was in need of upgrading with its white tiling looking very dated. The room was very warm and we had aircon on to try to keep cool however this didn't really work. The telephones didn't work correctly and when we told receptionist, she said we're not using properly, now this may be true if I was a millennial but at 51 I think I know how to use a telephone. There was no real quality to the ship at all we had a look round outside there was old cigarette ashtrays full with butt ends and water from previous weeks rain. There was also breakfast trays left outside rooms in corridor, by  late afternoon this is unacceptable in 5 star hotels.

Breakfast on both mornings was ok however no real service of what I would expect to be 5 star. There was tea and coffee both in urns.  I like a selection of different types but this was 1 tea only, which was like black syrup when in cup. The coffee was very similar and I couldn't drink it. The breakfast was a full monty affair, however it was served  in buffet style silver buckets with lids on, it was ok but the plates were stone cold and ccooled the food down even more when put on plate. It was quite tasty but certainly not 5 star service.

We had an evening meal at the ship, now I expect a certain standard when we are paying top dollar for dinner. The pricing was up there with good quality restaurants in central London. We ordered and went for the main meal option without starter due to not a huge amount of choice. Wife had fish and chips and mine was beef. We asked for a side dish of chunky chips and vegetables. It arrived and it wasn't very attractive on plate at all, looked like boil in the bag food, the plates were not hot, put chips on plate then the veg. The veg was luke warm I asked for gravy which arrived eventually but it was cool and was very bitter in taste. We sat there quite unhappy with what we had been served and got up and asked to speak to manager. She came over and was quite apologetic and she offered us a discount, she dud say we shouldn't have eaten the food and complained, however been of old school values we go o  the old adage of sending food back is not very productive with angry chefs, so we took the discount and as we told the manager we were going to the crowne plaza down the road to have our dessert. She didn't really  seem that bothered and we came to the conclusion they get a lot of complaints and all they can really offer is a sorry and a refund. She did actually say enjoy your dessert at crowne plaza, no offer of a free dessert.

I can only hope that this info is taken on board and they improve standards. I don't think the ship will be there in 2 years and if it is there will be a 3 star accommodation rather than the 5 that it claims to have ",3,2019,12,23
119,Nice hotel in good location,"Hotel is a large Yacht situated in Royal Victoria dock next to Excel . With in a few minutes walk from tube station Custom House for Excel and 5 minutes from Emirates Airline cable car 🚠 across to the dome aswell as the River Clipper .
Hotel rooms were large and spacious with a comfortable large bed ,lounge area and small balcony overlooking dock. En-suite bathroom with nice walk in shower. 
Lovely reception area and helpful and polite staff. Great lounge area with views looking towards the O2 Dome although have to say the lighting in all of the pillars were off putting and could make you dizzy.
No beers on draught and a 330cl bottle of Peroni and a small glass of wine was £19. 
Overall really enjoyed stay ",4,2019,12,22
119,Great hotel in a great location,"My family and I really enjoyed our stay on the Sunborn London. The staff were friendly and helpful, and the hotel was nice and clean throughout. We enjoyed the unique experience of a hotel on the water. Its location is great too as it’s close to the Emirates Cable car and The O2. Areas for improvement would be the sofa bed in the family room which was a bit uncomfortable. The air-conditioning made the toom a little bit stuffy. ",4,2019,12,21
119,Once the novelty has worn off its not that good,"Just come back from an over night stay from a coach party and went in via the lower entry such that did not see Reception area , Room was massive and very comfortable. Only had breakfast and had to ask for the plates to be warmed which  were stone cold took 5 minutes for this . Small selection of fruit and small selection of cereals was available . The main breakfast items were only luke warm and whilst the Hotel possessed bars and gym thats about all . The lifts were a bit of hit and miss and irregular . The Sunborn probably gains its use by the fact thats its a bit unusual  
",3,2019,12,21
119,Travelled up for the Buble concert and the boat stood out as a place to stay a little different from the norm,"Amazing reception, the boat feels special, it addds a little extra special to the stay as its not a standard hotel and no more expensive, the breakfast was great, table service at the bar. could not ask more from the experience or the staff",5,2019,12,20
119,Husband’s birthday treat,"We wanted to get away for a night mid week for my husbands bday and incorporate winter wonder land so I booked the Sunborn even though it was wuite away out of central London . 
We got to London and went on the cable car over to the yacht which was very lovely as weather sunny . 
The yacht was a short walk away and when we got inside it was nice . We had a couple of drinks in the bar as we had to wait for our room  , drinks expensive but it’s London and your on a yacht ... 
We got to our room which was lovely but very warm . I played with the air con but couldn’t get it under 21 .. 
We went out for the evening and came back to a boiling hot room which I couldn’t sleep all night as to hot ( I should of called reception to get the air con sorted . 
Breakfast wasn’t nice as it was tasteless , I had the vegetarian and my husband had the normal big breakfast and he said the same .. all tasted very bland . 
Surprisingly for a 4 star plus hotel .. 
All in all it was a pleasant stay and worth doing .. staff were great and scenery good .",4,2019,12,16
119,1 night stay,Very nice hotel but that’s where it ends. Expensive but nice food but poor service. Bar runs dry on beer so you have to buy bottles of beer at much higher cost. Advertising food all night for room service but when you order it they say kitchen being deep cleaned and no food. Saturday night and they decided to clean kitchen.  What a joke. So they give us menus for local pizza takeaway. Better off in a travel lodge 😡😡,1,2019,12,14
119,Lovely stay,The room was comfortable and beautifully decorated. The restaurant was amazing and the food delicius! The staff was friendly and helpful. We really enjoyed our stay. We will definately come back. Highly recommended!,5,2019,12,13
119,Great location and impressive hotel,"Went here with my family as we were staying to watch ‘Avengers Live’ in the 02, it was my sons birthday gift and he was very impressed with the hotel as you can imagine. The stay was nice however the room we were in was very noisy so I have graded 4 stars 
Food was great and location good also",4,2019,12,11
119,It’s a very big boat,"Nice hotel conversion of a very big boat. If you enjoy shiny sparkly decor then this’ll be right up your street.
Rooms are spacious and comfortable 
The bar offers quite good value in food and drink.
If you book well ahead, you can get a pretty good deal",5,2019,12,10
119,Fantastic rooms and restaurant. House keeping needs to improve.,"We stayed here for a weekend recently. The rooms were fabulous, large, well heated - loads of lighting options which is refreshing. UK and international plugs in the rooms. The bed was queen size - I did not expect 2 single beds pushed together, let alone 2 single mattresses! This made for a compromised sleep with the mattresses separating in the night. At least have ONE mattress even if it is 2 base units. 
The house keeping is best described as ""superficial"" - when we arrived (after 6pm) there were dirty dishes jin the floor outside our room from previous guests who checked out that morning. This is not good. Everything eye level is clean, but bend down or reach up and its dusty. 
You need to book the restaurant for evening meal. The for was fabulous and as good as any top class hotel - very good quality and service and the best part of our stay.
Breakfast is very frustrating as every day we had the same discussion ""your room does not include breakfast"" - yes it does. ""I will have to call reception and check"" - and then it is confirmed. Reception informed us this was because we booked with booking.com and their system doesn't recognise it. Come on guys! you are supposed to be a quality hotel and this is an embarrassing way to treat your guests. get your admin sorted out.
Breakfast is acceptable but can get busy.
The only way off the yacht is via the lift so check out time is busy - especially when one lift is down. Not ideal if you don't like using lifts either. 
Overall, lovely room, peaceful stay, fantastic evening meal. Admin and house keeping need work. 
Would we stay again? we are back in Feb to the area but have booked alternative accommodation.",4,2019,12,09
119,Amazing hotel,"Amazing hotel with a great atmosphere. We stayed here before a concert at the O2. It has great travel connections as there is the emirates skyline 2 minutes walk away and also the tube stop outside the excel. The hotel itself is very classy, and a all round great experience! this was booked as a 21st present for my girlfriend and they even left us some wine and truffles!",5,2019,12,08
119,Great stay,Hotel was lovely but felt it needs abit of refurb as bit tatty in rooms. The staff are great and friendly. Bit expensive to eat there even though we had breakfast which was lovely. Evening meal was a tad expensive,4,2019,12,03
119,Evening meal,"Just came back after having a lovely meal at the Sunborn Yacht. Service was awesome. Binoy served us with a welcoming smile and professionalism, making sure we were happy with each course.
Thank you Binoy for making sure our evening out was  perfect.
Will come back again with friends soon.",5,2019,12,02
119,lovely posh treat for the family,"Spent and absolute age looking for somewhere in London for a three day weekend.  Looked all over Airbnb and everywhere else i could think of.  Then i remembered that my brother stayed here recenetly and took a look.   Couldn't have been more impressed, fantastic service, free disabled parking for 3 days!!!! great breakfast selection and confy bed.  The room must have been well insolated too as we all had a very peacefull nights sleep which is a first.",5,2019,12,02
119,Amazing experience at sunborn restaurant,Took my Mrs for dinner at sunburn for our anniversary and everything form the food to the service was amazing! Was served by a lovely gentleman named Binoy who made the experience for us beautiful. Would fully recommend.,5,2019,12,02
119,Night away,"Stayed here for a night, lovely unique hotel... Plenty to do around the location with the Emirates cable carts to take you to the O2.
Only thing was an Irish coffee cost £12 which was in a wine glass and this was only half full, with a tiny bit of cream. I was underwhelmed.... So if I return, I won't order that again. 
Room was lovely and spacious, decent shower and would recommend.
Parking only £20 for 24 hours.. bargain!",4,2019,12,02
119,EXCELLENT,"Every year I meet up with friends in London to take in a show (Tina the musical). This year was a special birthday for me so they treated me to the champagne tea which was £50. It was excellent accompanied by 3 small glasses of champagne. 
The rooms are spacious, large and spotlessly clean. I had a dockside view.  They knew we were celebrating my birthday (60th) and they left me a bottle of red wine and chocolates in the room - a very nice gesture.
The bed was very comfortable and I can honestly say I have stayed in many London Hotels and this is the best. The Hotel is also very convenient to the Excel & O2. It's also right next to the Custom House/EXcel train station.",5,2019,11,29
119,Over priced & underwhelming,"Having stayed at the glorious Sunborn in Gibraltar, we were excited to book this hotel for the night. We paid over £300 for our executive room and looked forward to an afternoon and evening of some luxury.

Wow - we could not have been more disappointed. Walking up to the yacht, we were first surprised at the dismal condition of the outside. I have included a picture of the green sheen of algi coating the majority of the boat. Not very welcoming.

As we checked in, we were overcome with the smell of damp and out off by the worn and tired looking furniture. 

Our room was clean but VERY dated. The coffee table covered in scratches and the sofa so well worn the covers were sagging off the cushions. Great view from the balcony though.

The grout in the bathroom was filthy in places and the heated floor on full the entire time. We actually had to hold the bathroom door open for each other whilst we used the toilet because it was like a sauna in there and the door had a spring closure meaning it wouldn't stay open. 

We had a tablet in the room - which we assumed held the information about the hotel. However, it would only stay on for several seconds before stating it needed to be returned to the docking station to be charged - whilst already on the docking station. 

We went to reception that evening to order room service, seems as the tablet was not working. The lady took our room number and handed us a menu for a kebab house as the kitchen was being ""deep cleaned"". I checked the food hygiene rating of the kebab house and found it was a 1 star - probably quite in-keeping with the theme of the hotel so far. So we chose not to eat. 

Our tablet did not get replaced or repaired and so we not only didn't eat, we weren't able to access the other facilities on the yacht without having to approach the rather uncharismatic staff.

Breakfast was lovely though! We were sat at a window overlooking the thames and having not eaten any dinner the evening before, we devoured a full english. The coffee was lovely as well. 

We slept great - the beds are big and very comfortable. 

We actually feel taken advantage of having spent so much with the expectation of luxury. A B&B for a fraction of the price would have been a better experience. The pictures on the website are very misleading. 

We told the person at reception our grumbles before we left - she didn't apologise, she just said ""ok""!",2,2019,11,28
119,Interesting experience and a change to the normal overnight london stop,"The Sunborn Yacht Hotel opened in 2014, is a 420ft yacht moored in the Royal Victoria Dock, apparently built in Finland, fitted out in Amsterdam, and then towed across the North Sea to its present location in the Royal Victoria Dock providing an interesting experience and change for an overnight stay in London.

The main entrance is via two smallish lifts which, if you happen to be towing your luggage and arrive at the same time as a largish group of other people, can mean quite a delay standing outside - possibly in the rain! - whilst the lifts go up and down, and you wait your turn. The lifts not only provide entry to the yacht, but are also used by those already inside to get between the floors. Could have been better designed

However, once inside, the imposing curved central staircase, the dining room, lounge and bar areas give a good impression of life on the high seas, without any associated queasiness and sea sickness.

Arrived early afternoon so had time for lunch before heading out. The stone bass was lovely, well presented and cooked but, used to northern prices, did find that nearly £30 for the main course was somewhat over the top, otherwise a lovely meal in a pleasant setting with helpful and attentive staff. 

Our cabin was on the lowest floor, with a porthole window overlooking the water, quite spacious with two armchairs in the seating area, a large and remarkably comfortable double bed, nice pillows, and a reasonably well equipped shower room. Perfectly quiet with no noise whatsoever, producing a very good nights sleep.

Breakfast was well up to expectation, good range of cereals, fruit and yoghurt, cold meats and the usual cooked english, a request for an omelette was quickly dealt with and arrived very promptly - but do try and get in before about 8.30am as the dining room filled up around that time and may have caused some waiting.",4,2019,11,27
119,Shouldn’t have come back ,"We stayed here in its former position many years ago. It went away for a refit and came back. We’ve always wanted to stay again but it was very pricey. So when we saw a deal advertised I treated the Husband for his birthday. 

We were given a balcony room which was lovely. But it’s all very dated. Skirting was missing off the corridors. Smelt of damp musky carpets. Shower room was in need of bleach. Towels were huge and very thick and fridge was quiet. We had a zip and link which we like as it gives us a large bed but it was so hard I felt I hardly slept. 

We attempted to have a drink in the bar. Serious health warning here. They have LED strip lighting every 2ft running down the walls. I suffer from vertigo this immediately gave me problems. But my Husband who is fine said he was getting eye disturbances. So if you suffer from any kind of epilepsy don’t go in here. That left either the reception to sit in or a sofa next to the coats upstairs. We ordered a bar meal and when it was delivered to us a very loud argument ensued between the poor girl who served us and a more senior lady. I had to step in to explain why we were sitting there.  She backed down. But a customer should never be made to feel unwelcome especially as it’s the hotels fault. 

There is nowhere to drop off bags. So we had to drag them through the rain from the car park which is £20 for 24 hours. 

The lift on the bridge makes an awful scraping noise when it’s being used. The hotel might like to contact whoever maintains it as it’s not a pleasant noise from your room. 

It’s directly under the city airport landing route which we loved as we love planes. But note if you are a light sleeper. 

Breakfast was cold and quality of food not good. I’ve had better sausages in a Toby. 

So we should have left our memory of the place in the past. I really couldn’t see what had been done as the boat looks like something from the 70’s with smoked glass and terracotta material on the walls. 

The score of 3 is given for the views and the look of the boat from the outside. I would have been gutted if I had paid full price. £169 was the limit. ",3,2019,11,27
119,Bad luxury experience,"We decided to celebrate our anniversary here and expected good luxury experience here. But when we tried to go to our room from receptionist after check in, the receptionist did not tell us there would be decoration work in our floor. As a result, we got block for 10 mins just to enter our room and the building worker didn't even try to give in or help us to get rid of their work first. With more than 300 quid rate, we expect to have good luxurious experience for our anniversary. Instead you ruin it with bad impression even before entering your hotel room. Congrats to your hotel to make our day bad.",1,2019,11,25
119,November treat,"Excellant service and probably the quietest most comfortable hotel I have stayed in, we had a lovely cabin on the 3rd floor with a balcony which in better weather would have been a delight. The bar service and food were excellant , I recommend the club sandwich, big enough for two and thr Red Mist cocktail",4,2019,11,24
119,Afternoon tea,"Visited for afternoon tea on a Saturday. Beautiful setting and lovely decor inside the yatch. Staff were lovely and friendly. Unfortunately the afternoon tea didn’t live up to expectations. Ordered English breakfast tea which tasted like dish water. The food was well presented but the bread on the sandwiches was dry. Only didn’t complain as it was someone else’s booking. 
Service was good the food needs to be a lot better. Dry bread is unexceptable!!!!",2,2019,11,24
119,A Lovely Afternoon Tea in The Exquisite Surroundings,"My Friend & I treated ourselves to a wonderful Afternoon Tea aboard your beautiful yacht. We were made to feel very welcome & comfortable & The Tea plus Cocktail was absolutely delicious. Staff were attentive & helpful. The only downside we both agreed was The Tea was not very hot at all & very weak. Apart from that we had a great afternoon, we loved every minute. The whole place is exquisite.",5,2019,11,23
119,Beware “pre authorisation” !!!,"A comfortable and pleasant stay for work marred heavily by the £40 per night pre-authorisation for extras... that I said I didn’t need but was told it’s company policy.

I asked for a copy of the pre-authorisation, the receptionist then awkwardly explained that it was actually a debited charge, but, that I’ll get it back in 3-5 working days.

Hmmmmmmmm 🤨

Ps... the view from my balcony... if I stood up rather than sat.

119,Nice change from our usual trips - Very handy for the 02,"We stayed here for one night as we were attending a show at the 02. We had a nice double room with a balcony, it was all nicely finished. The entrance to the hotel was very smart and the receptionist was polite and helped us with the best way to the 02 (3 minute walk) then cable car. The one thing that disappointed me was that considering how nice the entrance and bedrooms were, the hallway really let it down, it just looked run down, they may be in the middle of renovating it so I don't want be too harsh but it just didn't feel like 4*. For £162 for a room, it's not the cheapest but if I were going to the 02, I would consider staying here again.",4,2019,11,21
119,Superb one night stay,"We spent one night on the Sunborn Yacht Hotel, it was not long enough! The room/cabin was excellent, lots of space and everything you would expect in a first class hotel. having a small balcony and view over the waterside was a bonus.  Information on an ipad and using it to control the TV was something I had not come across before. Breakfast was a buffet and everything seemed to be cooked in small batches so was fresh, there was plenty of choice. The bar area is quite small but very comfortable and for those lovely hot days and evenings there is lots of outside deck area to sit in.The yacht is in a great position, easy to find from the DLR and close to the Emirates Cable car. You can then catch the boat taxi into the centre of London. ",5,2019,11,20
119,Excellent,"this was an amazing choice. Loved it. Best room ever!!! I mean ever. And the atmosphere is the best as well. Thank you for your friendly staff and service. 
I would like to say that I was pleasantly surprised about this hotel.",5,2019,11,16
119,Poor Operations and Unhelpful Staff (Spa & Management),"After having a wonderful stay aboard the Sunborn in Gibraltar (partner visits their monthly for work and took me for a holiday) he thought it would be a lovely idea for us to have a visit to the one in London for my birthday, he purchased an Afternoon Tea and Massage for two on a Voucher Site. Although discounted and a good deal it still wasn't by any means 'cheap' so I had every hope the standard of care and customer service would be as impeccable as it was in Gibraltar - sadly we were very wrong. 

Spent 3 weeks trying to contact their Spa reception, found no options to select when we called via the number on their website, each time we called we would select another department in the hopes of being transferred to the Spa but no matter what department we selected the phone just rang out and no one answered or it looped back around to the main menu. Eventually we emailed in the hope someone would pick it up quickly, sent a request for a particular date that suited our work schedule, a slow reply later they advise us there isn't any availability - no other dates were offered, we had spent too long trying to make contact that I now didn't have the patience to bat back and forth via email just to book an appointment especially when the person on the other end was quite unhelpfully just replying with only 'we can't do that day'.

Instead of emailing again I called Gibraltar's Sunborn (easy as pie to get hold of them) and they managed to get me through to the London reception which in turn managed to put me through to the Spa - the woman that answered had absolutely no bedside manner or customer service skills - her general demeanour was that of ""we're busy what do you want me to do?"" I tried to see about availability and they had nothing for a further 3 weeks other than one 9am appointment mid-week. Noting of course that our voucher expired at the end of that month and their availability wasn't until the following month.

From there she also advised that once I booked for a treatment with the spa I would then separately need to contact the restaurant to book for Afternoon Tea. I didn't get this far, but I can only imagine the difficulty of lining up a treatment with Afternoon Tea on the same day within reasonable time of each other when the two departments work independently from each other (from previous experience Spa's I have visited usually book the two together to ensure no long waits)

I had a contact for a Director within the Sunborn in London due to the extensive bookings I make in Gibraltar's Sunborn Hotel through my work, I explained to him the issues I'd experienced in the hopes that at the very least he could offer us something small in way of an apology and to maybe encourage us to keep our voucher for future use but again he did little than say ""Sorry you couldn't book"". He mentioned nothing about reviewing processes or trying to better our already disappointing experience.
In the end I told the Spa not to worry about making a booking for me. I contacted the voucher site and requested a refund which they almost didn't issue but once I explained there was no availability they allowed it.

ironically in the last week a friend mentioned she booked a Spa trip to the Sunborn for another friend for her birthday -  the Spa contacted her a week before the trip and cancelled their booking and asked to re-book them for the following day. Trains tickets had been booked to London, time off had been booked/shifts swapped to make it happen and yet the manager that called to cancel kept repeating ""it's only one day later"" when my friend contacted her to complain. Again a complete lack of professionalism all round.",1,2019,11,13
119,Fabulous experience,"The wife and I were staying on the Sunborn yacht hotel Nov 2019 as a wedding anniversary gift from our daughter,
Overall it was an excellent, amazing experience for the whole of our stay.
Kind, friendly, efficient staff.
Clean airy rooms.
Excellent food .
Thank you to all the staff on Sunborn London for making our stay so enjoyable.",5,2019,11,12
119,Enjoyable stay,"Must admit we were expecting a bit more luxury for the price paid / 4*rating. However, had a lovely room with a balcony overlooking the water with great views of dockland. It was worth paying for the upgrade and the room was bigger than I expected. A few more toiletries should have been provided as we were travelling light and there was no bath cap or body lotion and only one mini shower gel for two people. The bar was very understaffed and waiting times in the afternoon was around 20-30 minutes, so a lot of people were complaining. They also stuck 12% service charge on top of that. The drinks were very expensive and wine list not great with very few wines by the glass. Because of this we were quite hesitant about booking the restaurant ,as were worried about the expensive price tag being worth the money. So glad we did as the food was excellent and of a very high standard. We didn't opt for breakfast as there is a lovely Italian Deli / cafe nearby and half the price. I have read the mixed reviews about the staff. We found them to be friendly and polite. Just a few niggles. There were food trays left out in the hallways for a good part of the day. The wine waiter served us room temperature white and thought that sticking it in an ice bucket was sufficient. Would I stay there again ? probably if the price was right. It's a good location. Lots of things nearby and easy transport links into other parts of London.",4,2019,11,12
119,"Extremely underwhelming and not luxury, stay somewhere else!","Let me start by saying please don't book this hotel, there are much better in hotels in London for the price and ones that actually are luxury. This advertises itself as a luxury hotel but it is very far from it and I've stayed in places that truly are luxury and you get the experience to match. This also rates itself as a 4* hotel but would be scraping the barrel if it were a 3* hotel.

My wife booked this hotel for my Birthday, as we thought she thought it would be something different and unique and it was for the wrong reasons. We checked in to the most dour of welcomes from the reception staff, who just give us our keys with no mention of the facilities. My wife had also previously called to mention it was my birthday but there was no mention of this and nothing to make it feel special, even in the room.

What was waiting for us outside our room though, was a pile of dirty trays and glasses, which looked it was from breakfast (it was 4pm at the time we arrived). When I complained to the reception, I was met with indifference and was told they would just clear it away but wouldn't do anything to make up for it, like it's perfectly acceptable for a ""luxury"" hotel.

The rooms are dated, with dirty carpets (both in and outside of rooms) and the whole experience was extremely underwhelming, especially as it was my birthday. For dinner, we opted to go out to Gauchos at the O2 and the service there was incredible and they also did a nice gesture for my birthday, which was really appreciated and wasn't so difficult.

I honestly have had much better experiences and welcomes, staying at Premier Inns, so would definitely avoid this place, which is a shame. Since our stay, I've had lots of people ask me how it was, as they would have been eager to try it but unfortunately I have been unable to recommend this place to anyone I've spoken to. Also, I am not one to leave negative reviews on a whim, if you look at my other reviews I've left some amazing reviews for other places I've stayed at that really were luxury and were the customer service was incredible.

This place really needs to go back to basics and train their staff on customer services and hotel management.",1,2019,11,11
119,Little night away,"We booked the sunburn yacht via Groupon as a one night getaway. We also booked to have breakfast included. On arrival we booked in but were early so left our luggage as we were going to go to the theatre the staff were very helpful and we upgraded our room to an executive with a balcony.
Once back from the theatre we went into our room which was lovely the balcony overlooks the Thames and although it was cold it was a lovely evening to look out. 
We went into the sunborn yacht bar and the staff were extremely helpful we had a bottle of wine and and a couple of coffees Plus some bar snacks my only downside of the bar was the cheapest bottle of wine is £34. Unfortunately you are a captive audience.
Breakfast on the yacht was fabulous you had your choice of a hot and cold buffet as well as pastries etc. Yes the carpet in the hallway is looking a bit tired and in need of renovation but on the whole the yacht was beautiful and the staff were very friendly and very helpful I would definitely stay again my only problem with it is it is quite out of the way",5,2019,11,11
119,Had better service at Premier Inn,"Booked for one night as a treat for husbands birthday. Absolutely no mention was made for that (while other people seemed to get a complementary bottle of wine, see other reviews). The welcome was not friendly and the experience lacked in general of the luxury they advertised. Stained carpets, breakfast tray with leftovers still standing in front of our room at 4pm. Room was ok and spacious, nice view, but as we complained about the breakfast leftovers just a plain aplogy, which we think was not good enough for this price. Bar with beautiful views but so overpriced, we left after seing the menu. Entrance to the reception only thru a painfully slow elevator, even if it would be just a couple of steps, but there is no other way in, so give time to enter! Overall, will not recommend.",2,2019,11,11
119,Not worth the money,"We decided to stay here as we have stayed at Sunborn Gibraltar many times and loved everything about it. First opinion was it was a lot smaller but that's fine. We checked in which went smoothly and staff were polite, then I walked into our executive Dock room view..... I thought I'd stepped into a time warp, so so dated that it reminded me of my grandfather's study. The bathroom was shocking, extremely small and much like a caravan bathroom. Room was clean and spacious but the decor was awful, view was of a piece of grass and the 'balcony' was an extended piece of metal. We went to the bar and paid £20 for 2 glasses of prosecco, which even by London standards is expensive. It was heaving and people were struggling to find anywhere to sit. I went to the bar as no one approached us and was abruptly told to sit down, I didn't, ordered my drink then had to deal with glares off the staff as they were wanting to free the table to other waiting guests. I complained at the front desk explaining for the £530 for 3 nights I had paid was overpriced and not worth it to which he replied there was nothing he could do and I would have to wait until morning. I went to reception in morning and was told we would have a refund and to check out immediately as it was 11am. Booked the Novotel opposite and loved it.

It's such a shame as the sunborn Gibraltar was amazing and I couldn't fault it where as this hotel is extremely dated, a lot smaller with a lot less amenities, only one bar area with limited seating and definitely not worth the money!",1,2019,11,10
119,Nice short stay,Stayed here after visiting Gibraltar & someone mentioned London has one too! Firstly it is nothing like the one in Gibraltar which is more of a cruise ship with alot more going on & 5 stars. This hotel though is nice & in a good location. Loved how dark it is in the room. We were able to sleep till 10.30am without any disruption! Was fab! We were going to have breakfast but the prices pp were ridiculous! Instead opted to go somewhere local more than half the price less! Shame as would have been nice to eat on the boat too. I think it needs something else to bring it to life abit more even some more coloured lights on it at nighttime to make it stand out would work better! Get some ideas from the Gibraltar sunborn & your onto a winner. ,3,2019,11,09
119,Fantastic ,"We have just enjoyed a wonderful stay on here. The room was bigger than we thought it would be and very clean. Tea/ coffee and bottled water available along with bath/shampoo products. We had a fantastic meal in the evening and the food was amazing. All of the staff we very friendly and helpful. 
We also had some treatments at the spa, where once again the whole service was well run and the staff very friendly and professional. 
All in all we have had a fantastic time",5,2019,11,08
119,Very nice,"Amazing hotel,with an amazing view,defo recommenced to friends and family,and would defo come back in the future,the hotel was clean and tidy and the room smelt very nice too,the champagne menu was a little expensive",5,2019,11,05
119,"Overpriced, over rated","Once inside there is nothing to make you feel you are experiencing something special. There is nothing on this dinghy to make it stand out from the other hotels nearby or in other parts of London which you can pay half of this price.  Everything was just OK, some of the reception staff think they are above serving customers, never known staff so rude, restaurant staff nice though and courteous, friendly and professional.
Room just ok
Wouldn't stay again
Disappointing overall",1,2019,11,05
119,THE SHOWER BLOCKAGE,"Our shower was so badly blocked no water would drain! My partner was trying to sort it out and it back filled and a load of black crap  came back up the drain. We also had a massive iron mark on our floor! When informing reception we wasn’t thanked for informing them they was making out like it was my fault. 

But the positives ! The food was lovely and the rooms are clean and the look of the boat was lovely ! 

The Resturant staff were amazing ! 

It is a shame me and my partner spent the majority of our morning try to have a shower and upon check out we was just Inform ‘these things happen’ .  The place is lovely and the cleanliness was great it’s a shame the staff on the front desk were not as helpful!",2,2019,11,04
119,Return visit to great hotel ,Located between Excel and the Emirates  cable car in Londons Docklands - this is a FAB place to stay. A small cruise ship wih no engines and permanently moored here !! Top quality- rooms are very well appointed- well worth paying the suppliment for a waterside  room with balcony. Staff are very welcoming  and service is efficient and friendly in all areas. Full restaurant available with snacks also served in the bar. Docklands  light railway with access to city and west end a 5 minute walk from Yacht.  ,5,2019,11,03
119,Great hotel moored in Victoria Dock,"Just spent two nights as part of significant birthday surprise with grown up family. Loved it. Great food, comfortable bar and good service. Very comfortable bed and a great place to use as a base to explore London. Would definitely stay there again. Top marks!",5,2019,11,02
119,Simply stunning.,Of all the places I've visited in the world this was by far the best hospitality I've ever received. Hotel was gorgeous and spotlessly clean. Staff were fantastic and nothing was too much trouble for them. They went out of their way to make you feel like your custom was valued and the treatment we were given was second to none. I'd definitely return and will highly recommend this amazing venue to others.,5,2019,11,01
119,Sundown Bar was a blast,"I absolutely loved the Sundown bar, very knowledgable, organised and super polite staff. Great atmosphere and amazing cocktails. Truly superb night! I would definitely recommend this to any toursit as well as Londoner!",5,2019,10,30
119,"Old, musty smelling rooms and small bathroom","3 star facilities and services at most. Walking into the hotel feels like traveling back to the 80s. Our room felt very stuffy and had a strong musty smell maybe because the windows couldn’t be opened (turning on the AC didn’t help either). Bathroom was extremely small (although to be fair the room itself was quite sizable) and the shower’s three fold sliding door was constantly stuck so we needed to squeeze into the shower sideways. Bathroom door closes automatically (with a loud thud) and was a hassle for us

Service wise, the front desk’s receptionists appeared indifferent in communications with guests, apparently enjoying chatters between themselves more. In a city that always rains, this hotel does NOT provide umbrellas to their guests so come prepared.",2,2019,10,30
119,A super yacht in Victoria Docks East London.,"Just the one night in a super room on the 3rd floor, with views over the water. Close to the Excel Centre and the Docklands Light Railway to travel to inner city. The room was fantastic, really big, extremely clean and very well presented. The restaurant was really good, food quality excellent and all round very quiet. We booked through Secret escapes and that all worked well.It took about 30 minutes to get to the West End and is an easy train journey, possibly involving one change, on the same line , depending on whether you want to go to Tower and Bank. Very friendly and efficient staff- all in all a great place just a little outside central London",5,2019,10,29
119,Husband's 50th Birthday,What an amazing stay.  I booked this as a surprise for my husband's 50th birthday and he was very impressed.  The staff were very friendly and welcoming and couldn't do enough to help and even put a complimentary bottle of wine and chocolates in the room with a personalised letter. I booked the classic King room with River View and it didn't disappoint.   Would definitely recommend staying here.  Can't comment on the food as we didn't eat on board.,5,2019,10,29
119,Interesting stay but lacks finesse,"The Sunborn Yacht Hotel provides an interesting stay.  The room we had was spacious, clean and comfortable. Our room was ready on arrival, which was welcomed as we arrived slightly early.  We ate in the Lands End restaurant on the Yacht.  The food was tasty but the service average.  The staff were friendly and helpful but the finer details which would be expected of a four star establishment were missing. The dress code is smart casual, but unfortunately this was not followed by all guests. We ordered a bottle of wine which was poured without being offered the opportunity to taste first, our main course arrived with the waiter saying 'hi guys'. We visited the sundown bar after dinner which is advertised as greeting 'its clientele with a sparkling atmosphere that oozes sophistication and indulgence', unfortunately this was not the case.  The bar was noisy and quite full, we ordered two gin and tonics which arrived in non gin glasses with little ice.  The two drinks costs £40.  On checking the price list the following morning we noted that each drink was a double shot, and should have included redberries and rosemary, these had not been included in our drinks the night before.  We had not ordered double shots but it seems that this is the standard measure, we were not advised of this, could guests be advised when ordering drinks? The rooms in the vacinity of ours were noisey with presumably other guests until around 01:30hrs.  Breakfast was good with choice of cold and hot food with great views across the river.  All the staff were trying their best and we did feel that the examples given of average service may be due to poor training rather than a disinterest in customer service.  For the prices being charged, and the marketing of the yacht I would have expected more.  This hotel promises alot, sets high expectations but delivers much less, with more investment in staff training, particularly customer service, the experience could be so very different - perhaps it is worth a try?",3,2019,10,27
119,Spoilt rotten,Even though our room wasn't quite ready on arrival was offered complimentary drinks at the bar then upgraded by Tadas to a fantastic room with jacuzzi and sauna. Evening meal in Lands End restaurant was perfectly cooked and service by Binoy was very attentive and welcoming. Can't praise the staff and location highly and hope to come back in the near future.,5,2019,10,23
119,Outstanding experience,"Experience the Afternoon Tea while there. The food presentation is outstanding, the quality of the food is very good and the staff offer outstanding professional, efficient and friendly service. Nothing is too much effort for them. You will come away feeling like you were royalty dining. Definitely an experience you will remember fondly for years to come.",5,2019,10,21
119,Great location and lovely room,Stayed here as a couple. Hotel located next to emirates cable car. Great location. Check in very friendly. Rooms luxurious. Would have given it five stars but for two reasons. The lighting in the bar is not good. Made both me and my wife feel ill and not normally photosensitive. Other issue was sofa in our lovely room had been made up into a bed. Stopped us sitting down on it. But this was minor. Would def stay here again. Breakfast lovely too with smoked salmon.,4,2019,10,19
119,Amazing 5*,"Bought voucher from Wowcher as a treat for myself and my cousin as it will soon be our 50th birthdays. 
As soon as we arrived, we were shown to our table and asked If we had any allergies, what tea we would prefer and what cocktail we would like.
Our waitress was called Salomey and she was lovely. She asked us why we were there and told her about our pending birthdays so when our afternoon tea came out, there was a Happy Birthday chocolate  on the top of our brownies. 
The tea itself was faultless. Finger sandwiches, warm fruit scones, mini bakewell, an amazing lemon macaron, panna cotta and chocolate brownie. As well as the cocktail we also had a pot of tea ( earl grey was lovely).
I must admit we scoffed the lot and were so full afterwards, we could hardly move.
I would really like to thank Salomey as she made us feel so welcome and looked after us so well. 
Sunborn, you have a star of an employee in her.
The yacht itself was massive  and really beautiful inside. I would definitely recommend the Sunborn as a special treat and look forward to returning one day.",5,2019,10,19
119,Granddaughter's memory,"We stayed here as part of my granddaughter's memory weekend. Our room was facing the water, so good view. Large family room with all the extras you would expect. Good nights sleep and decided to have breakfast. Children eat free, but for £19.50 each, the breakfast was not great. The service was sparse and my husband and I decided that they didn't like children!!! Had a great time and the look on my granddaughter's face when she realised we were sleeping on the Sunborn was priceless...",4,2019,10,15
119,1st Wedding Anniversary Visit,"We stayed at the yacht hotel to celebrate our 1st year wedding anniversary. We paid to upgrade our room to one with a balcony overlooking the river, this was definitely worth the upgrade as the view was amazing. We had a delicious dinner on the boat, as well as a bottle of wine watching the sun set over Canary Warf. We had a fantastic time, and would thoroughly recommend a visit to this hotel.",5,2019,10,15
119,WOW FACTOR Just not there.,"We stayed at the Sunborn for our wedding anniversary and in all fairness were a bit underwhelmed. Although the hotel knew it was our 31st Anniversary not once were we wished any sentiment throughout our stay.  I just feel this was an opportunity missed to make the guest feel a little special. The room was not ready although in fairness we were earlier than advised booking in time. This was no big deal but my credit card was debited with a deposit although the room had been paid in advance. However when we decided to have lunch in the bar whilst waiting, the account with my card was not allowed to be used without room allocation. . The bar although nicely done lacked any waiter/waitress service except after ordering and paying at the bar. Bar food and drinks were extremely expensive for what they were and were in my opinion grossly overpriced even for the location of the hotel. The room was an executive room and had a water view which was lovely. The breakfast in the morning had plenty of choice and was well received In summarising, the sunborn offered no more than a normal hotel within the same area with the same outlook. There was no movement that perhaps you expect on a boat which just makes you feel you are actually on a boat rather than just in a hotel. Perhaps we are more critical having been on cruises as well as land hotels. However, when all said and done, the staff in all departments were lovely. They were smiling, polite and assisted if ever needed.  ",3,2019,10,14
119,Couples massage ,"Thank you so much Nicola and team for the couples massage. It’s was a lovely experience and accommodating to our time schedule. 

The lady’s that did the massage where very effective getting those kinks and knots out. ",5,2019,10,14
119,Very good value night's accommodation in a very different location,"I - and as it turned out everyone who stayed the night we were there - noticed that the price you pay for a night's accommodation varies from just over £100 to, aparently, over £800 depending when you go. For the lower rate, it's ridiculously good value, and to have you bedroom in the form of an upmarket cruising state room, great fun. I traveled on the Queen Mary 2 a few months ago, and this was much bigger and more comfortable. It's slightly worn round the edges: some of the furniture is scuffed, and the strip was peeling off the door of the room next to us. 

I'd recommend a river facing cabin (which costs a bit more) as you can look back towards Canary Wharf, the Millenium Dome and the folly ski lift, which makes for a lovely view as the sun sets. We had two G&Ts in the bar (an eye-watering £31.50) and sat neat the windows expecting the nice view. Someone obviously sold them a job lot of LED lighting, as strips of it border all the windows, which actually gave me a headache. A shame, as the wnindows are huge facing aft. 

If you can book one of the cheaper nights, it's hard to beat.One last thing: you are staying on a floating car park, not a superyacht. It doesn't have any engines, or anything else you might expect to find on a sea-going vessel, but if you have your photo taken with the prow behind you, your friends and relatives will believe you've been staying on Roman Abramovich's superyacht. I'd recommend it.",4,2019,10,14
119,Luxury Night with helpful staff,"Booked via Groupon for a classic room with dock view but arrived to an unexpected upgrade of an executive room with balcony and river side view! Stayed on the third floor and was very quiet and everything worked well in the room. Lovely huge bed very comfy. Best breakfast I've ever had included in the price, delivered to the room very quickly for just £4 with pastries, toast and fresh juice and sauces. Staff couldn't do enough for you, best hotel experience I've had- wish I could've stayed for longer.",5,2019,10,12
119,Beware of rip off upgrade!,"We booked for a romantic 2 day break, without children and were allocated a dark and dingy room in the bottom of the yacht with a view of a dock wall, unhappy with this we went back to the Reception and were told we would have to pay an extra £80 to upgrade to an Executive Room with a dock view and a balcony. What the Receptionist DIDN’T explain was that it was an extra £80 PER NIGHT! We didn’t realise this until my husband checked his bank account, he rang the hotel but was basically told “tough”. I’ve praised this hotel to all my friends, work colleagues and family all this week, something I will be retracting!",2,2019,10,11
119,Extremely Disappointed,"Hotel room climate control was broken and the standard ventilation was so rattly that sleep was next to impossible. The bathroom heating was stuck on permanently so that it was 33deg inside at all times. The staff didn't do anything except call maintenance which was completely pointless. The worst thing though was the hotel decided to move furniture and remodel on the floor above at 1am to 4am that included loud crashes, constant loud footsteps, running and dragging furniture. The staff didn't understand that noise propagates down from level 3 (reception) down the metal floor to rooms below. Its didn't even stop when multiple rooms complained.
Yes it is directly under the final landing approach of London city airport and is very noisy when a plane lands about every 15 minutes. Don't believe others that say it isn't a problem, it certainly is. Flights start 0630 ending 2230. 
In a word the place is terrible and really upset that this was the first hotel we stayed in on our trip and it was for 5 nights.",1,2019,10,11
119,"Lovely room , lovely view and lovely food 😁","We stayed in room 2028 which overlooked the lock . Very quiet room which was well equipped. We also ate in the lovely restaurant in the evening. It was quite busy so make sure you book . My partner is a coeliac so needs gluten free food . The staff are quite knowledgable on this however a small mishap probably a language barrier thing lead to a very small mistake which was very speedily rectified . This just proved how good and professional the restaurant staff were . We would definitely recommend the sunborn. One thing to note though , the local area is very quiet and unless you really want to stay on the ship there’s very little else to explore locally. ",4,2019,10,09
119,Amazing,"This hotel is amazing , don’t be put off by any negative reviews. Totally loved it and thanks to all the staff , would return any time -brilliant . Cleanliness excellent and staff were all friendly and helpful .",5,2019,10,09
119,Unique stay in London,"Why stay in a boring hotel when you can stay on a yacht?
My second stay here, and this time my wife joined too.
The cabins/rooms are large and comfortable, and ours had a balcony.
The food in the restaurant was excellent and the fixed price menu was good value for money.
Will definitely return.",5,2019,10,09
119,Trip to London,"Beautiful Yacht hotel on the Thames (Victoria Dock).
Staff were really nice, room was lovely. Unfortunate that the was a conference on so having two separate events going in the yacht they were only serving bar meals so didn’t get experience the beautiful meals that they have on menu, Went to a restaurant on the Dock instead.
Did take full advantage of the Continental and Full English breakfast though which was very good.
Would definitely recommend for a special treat 👍🏼🥂",4,2019,10,09
119,Beautiful hotel on the water!,"Love this hotel, staff were excellent as was the food! 
Clean spacious rooms with a balcony. Great to stay somewhere a little bit different, great for all occasions. 
Cocktails were fab too.... Reception welcome was very good especially with a upgrade. 
Loved it... will definitely come back.",5,2019,10,09
119,Great Hotel for London Excel,"I have stayed at this hotel on numerous occasions, particularly for MCM Comicon as it’s situated directly outside London Excel. The beds are comfortable, the rooms are spacious (much bigger than most in the area), staff are generally polite and helpful. I would say some of the furnishings are a little tired though and the afternoon tea is disappointing for the price you pay.",4,2019,10,08
119,Wow 👌,"By far this is the nicest place we have stayed, the food was amazing and as it was my birthday the hotel had little surprises for me which where so lovely. Staff were great too. Very attentive. Amazing place to stay and create memories. Thank you so much",5,2019,10,06
119,"Great location, perfect stay!","Staff, room, food all very good. Good value with a great location. Only slight issue was ventilation in the bathroom and lack of shower gel. We will return for sure for the O2 which is only a cable car trip away and any trade shows at the Excel.",5,2019,10,05
119,Biblicak,"Great place, good value. Great space and bed. When I stopped there I think there was a religious convention at the nearby excel as I heard a lot of loud praying late at night with Christ and the lord a major part of the muffled script. It sounds like this may have been a nun......",5,2019,10,04
119,It’s nowhere near as nice as the Gibraltar Sunborn...,"We stayed here for 2 nights last month, it’s a nice yacht, it’s a decent price for London. It’s a long way out of central and what really was a downer was that it’s nowhere near as lovely as the Gibraltar Sunborn yacht, which is such a let down.",3,2019,09,30
119,Overnight stay in London,I found this hotel and thought it might be a bit quirky so decided to book.. very happy although we didn’t spend too much time on the yacht due to sightseeing.  We were upgraded to room 5022 and were pleased with our room overlooking the dock - seeing the planes come into land was interesting and not particularly noisy.. we found the staff easy to deal with and checking in and out was straightforward...,5,2019,09,29
119,Afternoon tea,"Weather was grotty so we arrived early deciding to get a coffee in the bar. Good view but 2 coffees were £10 and the server seemed a bit anxious that we would leave without paying. Food for the tea was great but service inconsistent. We didn’t feel looked after once the tea stand was placed, and along with a neighbouring table we had to chase the included champagne tasting, request more water etc. There were problems with the lifts.
So, in summary, it was ok but could have been so much better.",3,2019,09,26
119,Very pleasant afternoon Tea.,"We had a very pleasant
Afternoon on the yatch, excellent service and very nice food.
It was very quiet the day we were there, so it lacked a bit of atmosphere.  It was a little pricey, but afternoon teas are generally like that.",5,2019,09,26
119,Excellent ,"This was my fourth time staying on the yacht and the first time having a room on the water side. I love the large room comfy beds, luxurious en suite with fluffy towels. Our kettle didntbwork but was replaced with a new one immediately. A great breakfast with good choices in the beautiful dining room.",5,2019,09,23
119,Very memorable night (despite the noisy neighbours),"A memorable, fun night in a great setting.
This was a treat for my wife's birthday, and 3 of us stayed in a family room. It's a glamorous place and we really enjoyed evening drinks in the sun looking out over the water. 
There are plenty of nice places to eat within a short walk, so you are not limited to eating 'on board'.
It was such a shame that the folks in the next room decided to have a drunken argument that started at 8.30pm and was still going at 2.30am.The nature of the boat means that soundproofing isn't the same as in a normal building, and we got the full benefit of their limited vocabulary. But it must be said that the Reception team dealt with the situation as well as good be expected, and responded promptly.
Definitely a fun and stylish place to stay.",5,2019,09,22
119,Fantastic afternoon!,"My friend and I celebrated our birthdays with an afternoon tea and champagne tasting. The service and attention to detail was incredible, Salomey served us and should be commended for her excellent customer service. Nothing was too much trouble, we had a fabulous afternoon, would highly recommend!",5,2019,09,21
119,Couples date night,"Nearly didn't book this hotel, because of all the negative reviews, room is lovely , clean and big for a cabin room,  reception great, no complaints at all. Don't understand all the negative reviews,  very glad I did book this hotel. ",5,2019,09,20
119,Well it should have been good. But!,"Impressive from the outside. Excellent reception. Rooms require update. Bathroom is basic. My hairdryer did not work. Water pressure in shower not great. In bedroom, tv requires updating. A/C noisy. Rooms very clean as is bathroom.

In the bar, well limited stock. No crisps or nuts. Drinks very expensive.

Breakfast very good . Coffee awful. Tea stewed.

Hot food we thought very good.

Car parking very poor.",3,2019,09,19
119,PERFECTLy Appointed for Business or Leisure - Close to EXCEL,"I've put up our team three times at the Sunborn for trade shows at Excel in London. The property is conveniently located so that you can avoid the hassle of traffic in the morning and evening while attending a conference. Also, the rooms are quite nice, bar and restaurant are perfect for hosting guests around your trade show. Also, the internet connectivity is superior and if you need meeting space - they have it. All around excellent. I highly recommend!!",5,2019,09,19
119,Stayed one night hoping for luxury and meeting my Australian cousin after not seeing her for 10 years!,"We were so looking forward to staying on this luxury Yacht Hotel.  My Australian cousin and her partner were staying on the Yacht for 8 nights, due to her partner working at the Excel Conference centre near by.  When we arrived the yacht was lovely as was the room.  But you would expect because or the high nightly tariffs that the following should have been to a better standard.
The Yacht itself was lovely, as expected.  However, it was such a shame that once inside some standards dropped.  The staff were not friendly, really could smile more! The bedroom, we had porthole window not balcony on 2nd floor, was lovely, but again for the price, would have expected some extra finery's. Example: very basic hairdryer with one setting which was so hot it burns your face when drying hair. 
Also, most odd but the towels provided were very rough, as was the white bedding, maybe a dressing gown supplied! The food was very over priced and not top quality as expected. Our one breakfast was disgraceful for such luxury accommodation: Very small buffet station, eggs were cold, scrambled eggs were dreadful, full of liquid. Baked beans hard.  Also, for the price charged - £20 + , it was not good, plus no tea or coffee served at the table, you had to collect from a station.  Even the toast you had to make yourself on rotating machine - had better in guest house in Seaton!!! We didnt eat dinner on the Yacht.  My cousin and her partner took dinner in the restaurant their first evening.  Was not good, especially for the price. The couple next to them sent their meals back! Also the wines very over priced.  I am not one to generally complain - and I certainly know London prices are high.  Also, one doesnt mind splashing out more for a bit of luxury - but the food was not luxury, far from it and the wines were way over priced.  If I had money to spend on luxury, would I stay on the Yacht again - No.  Not because of the Yacht or the setting, which was lovely, but because they cut too many corners on food and drink and many small things, that should have been top class for the prices paid.",3,2019,09,19
119,Afternoon Tea while staying overnight in the Yacht,"We arrived late for our booked time slot of 330pm. The very nice lady who checked us in at the reception desk advised the restaurant team we would be late.

The restaurant was nearly empty just two other couples, which made the five or six staff we encountered out numbered!

The food was very good, decent choice, fresh and well prepared.
We both had a strawberry cocktail which also was very good.

Now follows why we gave the experience an average score.

The staff seemed to be very easy going. It was like they were on a period of downtime after the lunch rush and before the dinner rush.

We waited what seemed like a lifetime for the food, even longer (almost finished) for the tea.

They took most of the cutlery away so we had to ask for extra knives and teaspoons which seemed to again take ages and was a chore.

Getting the bill was quick and easy....

The value for money was good, venue was great, sadly poor service considering the type of establishment it is pretending to be.

Yes I think we may return, hopefully the service will improve.

I will write a separate review for the rooms and evening bar service.",3,2019,09,18
119,What a disappointment,"I booked for my husband and myself to stay on the boat to celebrate our 20th wedding anniversary, as I thought it would be something different.  Every step of the booking stage I informed them it was a special occasion and when staying at other hotels, usually the hotel arranged something special, sadly this wasn't the case.  When we arrived at the station their website advises, we were told by a very unhelpful member of staff that we were not allowed to walk through to the boat and I could not inform me how to get there either!  I then called the boat and on the first attempt someone lifted the receiver and then just hung up.  On my second attempt they informed me that there was some kind of security event that weekend and that all of their guests had been sent a email, I was not sent this email.  I was then informed that I needed to get back onto the DLR to the next station and walk!  I am so glad I only had very minimal luggage with us, as its a good 10-15 walk from the other station.  When we finally arrived at the boat and and informed them of everything, there wasn't even an apology!  I had booked treatments at 3pm for both my husband and myself and I enquired at reception what was the procedure, I was informed to come to reception 5 minutes before the treatment time and someone would come and collect us.  At 3.05pm I enquired again at reception, as no one had come to collect us.  You can imagine my horror when I get into the treatment room to be told, she could not do all of my treatments because I was late! I told her that reception were aware of my arrival, but as there was someone else booked in at 4pm, they could not accommodate me.  The room itself is quite nice, comfy bed and pillows and we were lucky enough to have a river view.  In the bar the staff seems to take ages to serve you and every time I ordered a gin and slimline tonic, i had to return it, as it was full fat! Once I can understand, but everytime!  Breakfast the next morning was a bit chaotic, empty tables that needed clearing and the table we were sat at, had no cutlery or condiments.  It is a self service buffet, which isn't great.  The coffee is luke warm and tasteless and we were just lucky enough to grab the last cups.  The hot food is in tureens and in my opinion just dries everything out.  There were no fried eggs or hash browns, so had to wait and when the eggs did arrive there were only 2 and there were about 10 people waiting.  When checking out you are asked was everything OK, you tell them your complaints and they just say sorry.  Something else we observed when we arrived at 3pm.  The room next to us had left their room service tray outside the door, with a half eaten chocolate cake, that was still sat there when we returned at 1:00am, not very nice :(  I would not really recommend staying here, which is a real shame and a very special event sort of ruined because of it.",2,2019,09,18
119,Faulty Towers On Water,"To start with a positive some of the staff were very good as was the dinner. We stayed for two nights paying circa £400 with dinner on the one night. Our first room had a view not of the Thames but 12 red industrial bins. We was after much complaining moved to another room that still offered no view of the river but did at least not face a refuse tip. Regrettably however, very aged aircon system of the ""boat"" and i use that word with caution as it never has been a working vessel is very old and was producing 62db of noise when measured from out bed (for reference 60db is that of a normal conversation). Hence another move was required, guess where to? Yup back to the view of the garbage. In fairness we was moved on the 2nd evening to a more suitable room. Breakfast on both mornings was a joke, waiting 15 mins for cups, followed by a further 10 mins for coffee. Oh I almost forgot the 30 min wait for eggs. All in the all the boat is very old in need of a major refurb, the staff are let down by the owners and senior management in their lack of support. I would not recommend and will not be back. ",2,2019,09,18
119,Something Different!,"Two very happy people here as well :)  We've just had a great weekend stay on the Sunborn Yacht to celebrate my husband's birthday and enjoyed every minute.  The staff are really good and helpful and friendly.  It was warm enough on Saturday night to start our meal outside at 8.30pm but it wasn't a problem when we got to the pudding course to ask if we could go inside for that, and we were quickly moved.  The food was very good and nicely presented on plates that were hot - which is always good.  The weather helped of course, but the stay was lovely, and something different.  Super view from our balcony during the day, and at night time when everything across the water is lit up.  We would definitely go again and look forward to it.",5,2019,09,16
119,Fabulous staff,"My husband and I had a wonderful overnight stay for our anniversary. We had an Executive room with River view. Well worth paying the extra for the lovely little balcony. Room was spacious and clean. Bathroom a bit of a disappointment as so small but nothing major. We had lunch, dinner and breakfast the following morning. All food absolutely delicious. From start to finish ALL staff were courteous, friendly and helpful. Extra special praise goes to Nathan in the bar, Binoy in the restaurant and the french male restaurant manager who’s name I didn’t get. They all went above & beyond to make our stay so lovely. Would definitely go again. In the rooms I’d like to see an improvement in the toiletries (variety not quality) and more teas & decaf coffee. Not a complaint just a little side note. Two very happy customers here. ",5,2019,09,15
119,Sadly not a celebration,"After check-in I went to my cabin and found it to be extremely hot.  As there were no openable windows, I put the air conditioning on and set it to 17 deg.  I noticed warm air coming from the a/c unit and the temperature displayed on the thermostat was 26 deg.  I tried adjusting, but the temperature kept returning to 26 deg.

I went to reception, reported the situation and the reception clerk said he would go and look.  When he returned, he said all was working, but it would take time for the cabin to cool.  I went to the bar for a drink then returned to the cabin, to find it just as hot.  I reported the matter again before dinner, I was told that the a/c was now working properly.

After dinner I returned to the cabin to find the cabin still hot.  I reported the matter again, I was told by the reception clerk that he would adjust the a/c, so I went to the bar.  When I returned to the cabin it was warm, so I went to bed.  I was woken at 03:00hrs by the noise of the a/c and the cabin was so hot that I was sweating.

My partner and I packed our luggage and checked out.

This evening was booked as a treat for my 60th birthday and my recovering from prostate cancer.  The night was ruined.",1,2019,09,14
119,AMAZING AMAZING!!!!,"Don't know where to begin, hotel staff excellent, free upgrade which was greatly appreciated, you get a real coffee machine in the room with biscuits, we tried the lobby bar, yes it is expensive but the atmosphere and service makes up for it, will be coming back. ",5,2019,09,14
119,Afternoon tea,"What a really lovely spot for afternoon tea, Beatrice you Star! Thanks for your correspondence and wonderful greeting! My friend and I had such a wonderful time catching up and enjoying the spread. Thank you 😊",5,2019,09,13
119,Wonderfully different stay,"I stayed at this yacht/ hotel last night as I wanted to be near Canary Wharf where I had court the next day.
It just has that wow factor throughout! From the outside to the amazing chandelier and stairs and the lovely cabin- like rooms. You just feel that you’re treating yourself rather than staying in the run of the mill hotel.
The view from the upper deck at sunset is beautiful. 
The service was faultless. When I ran out of Tra bags and milk, the chap on reception gave me a whole handful! 
When I realised in the morning that I’d forgotten my toothpaste, I called reception and they sent me 2 boxes with toothbrush and toothpaste.
There are lots of places to eat nearby.  I ate at the nearby Lebanese restaurant which served delicious piping hot food.
It is also very near the emirates cable cars if you wanted to have a round trip for night sights.
All in all, it made a very tiring 2 days of court completely worthwhile. Would love to come again !",5,2019,09,13
119,Customer service,Came in for an afternoon tea with a friend & the customer service was amazing. Especially from Salomy  & Jennifer. You made our afternoon so enjoyable and special. Will definitely be coming back again . Thank u,5,2019,09,12
119,Disappointing (and I dislike posting negative reviews but had no option),"Having read a few of the other reviews, sadly, I have to agree with how disappointing this ""hotel"" is.  It is somewhere we have wanted to stay for a while and a group of us booked rooms to celebrate a special birthday.  We experienced several issues whilst there but despite mentioning them to staff very pleasantly, received no actual assistance with any of them.  The final straw being when the waitress sneezed into her hands, wiped on her uniform and put her hand inside the glasses we were meant to be drinking from.  We requested clean glasses (not unreasonable) and the waitress sulked and complained about our request!!!!  We requested an upgrade to a better room (prior to arrival) and was charged accordingly and then discovered the only difference between that and a standard room was a marginally larger balcony!!! Not much use in the winter months.  As previously mentioned in other reviews, some of the bar area was shut off and there were parties going on late into the night  resulting in horrendous disturbance. It has the potential to be such a lovely smart hotel with a unique value but falls short on all accounts.  I too, really do not understand why the management aren't addressing all these negative comments especially as some as just down to staff training and common sense.  We did write to Guest Services but received no response.  Upon chasing we received a bland, unhelpful email which did not address any of the issues. Such a shame, but we will definitely not be returning.",2,2019,09,12
119,Couples trip Aug 19,I booked this as a 40th birthday treat for my husband. Close to the DLR so easy to get around. Something different to staying in usual hotel. The Yacht is a little tired in places but all in all a good place to stay. Would recommend the river view side and a balcony .  ,4,2019,09,12
119,Complete Waste of Money,"Very Disappointed with our stay on the Sunborn boat in London, and was not what we expected.
Not able to book a meal in the restaurant (tried booking this 6 weeks before our stay but told it was fully booked up)
They closed off one of the two bars to residents on the boat due to a party taking place.
The bar that was opened was badly run and unable to cope with the number of customers using it. The waiting time was horrendous. 
The boat is located a long way from the centre of London and there’s not much to do in this area and not many bars or restaurants in the local area, so not having access to the restaurant on the boat meant we were unable to find any good restaurants and bars to go too. 
The boat is in a tired condition and in need of refurbishment.
We would definitely not stay on this boat again and our recommendation is to book a nice hotel closer to the center of London and make use of the tourist areas and the good bars and restaurants available to you.",1,2019,09,10
119,Absolutely Atrocious,"If I could leave zero stars I would. This is not a hotel, it's a broken ship they're trying to make money off of. Don't let them tell you it's a hotel. They host dance club parties until after midnight and lie about the time it will end. They refuse to move you to a new room, even when the AC in the ceiling is shaking from the dancing and jumping in the ""club"" above your room. Rooms on the first floor are too hot (over 28 degrees Celsius/80 degrees Fahrenheit). We were told maintenance would fix it, but we came back after the entire day out, and our room was still a sauna. Manager was unwilling to offer us anything besides 50% of one night's stay for one room. We have 5 rooms and booked a reservation for 3 nights, with 3 out of the 5 rooms having temperature control problems, plus the noise level. On top of all of these issues, the service is horrendous! Bar/wait staff are terrible. Did not get any of our food orders right, would say they would bring a drink and then never did, if didn't know the answer to a question said they would ask and never came back. Management should be held accountable, but the manager was useless. Additionally,  there were hairs in the shower when we first got to our room....dirty and disgusting! Overall, horrible rooms, location, cleanliness, and service. DO NOT STAY HERE!!!!!!!! It is the worst hotel experience we have ever had!!!",1,2019,09,07
119,Friends 70th birthday celebration,"We have stayed on this yacht before and so knew what to expect. We were not disappointed, the rooms are amazing, bed very comfortable, the whole yacht is clean and tidy, polished and bling!!! Loved it, thank you! ",5,2019,09,07
119,Nice stay ,"We arrived yesterday (Wednesday) afternoon and parked our car in the Novotel, about a minute walk. When you come round the corner, there is this enormous yacht sitting there and made me say wow. It’s very impressive. The pictures don’t do it justice on how good it looks. 
Took the lift up to reception and greeted by some very friendly and efficient staff. 
We were quite early but luckily our room was ready. 
Rooms were very clean and well equipped.
Did not make use of the balcony, we were on the land side. Next time we go, We will upgrade to a water side room. 
Bed was really comfortable and had a great sleep. 
Shower was hot and clean. 
The interior decor of the hotel and rooms is dated but it’s still very nice and grand. 
Was worried that you would actually feel it rocking being on water but never noticed that once. 
Bar staff were good and fast.
Breakfast was nice and the buffet was constantly being replenished with fresh food. 
I do recommend this hotel for a short stay and we will be going back.

119,Sunborn London,"I booked this via Groupon for my mum and me and we had a lovely time, reception staff were friendly and I was surprised that they didn’t ask me as usual for my voucher code - lol!  We went out and ate at the Bar n Grill which was good although a decor is bit dark inside and waited awhile for our food although there was hardly anyone else eating 🍽!!  

We had a beautiful large room overlooking the Thames (?), thankfully.  Breakfast was leisurely and lush and overall my mum really enjoyed the experience although she said I nearly killed her with all the walking & stairs getting there from Harrow & Wealdstone🤣.

For something different, I’d recommend (especially via Groupon😉) and my mum most importantly enjoyed every bit of it!!!

119,Quirky overnight London  stay,"We had very spacious  rooms on deck 5 with a river view which was lovely looking  over to the 02 and cable car and canary wharfs high rise buildings. Spectacular  view at night. Delicious  meal in the main restuarant  with impeccable service. Although  a bit breezy we had coffee and liquers outside on the back of the boat taking in the view. Very comfortable beds and pillows  so a good nights sleep. Breakfast was varied and self service. Ok but not great considering the hefty price tag
Overall  a very luxurious yacht with a mixture of clientele. Few restuarants nearby  but not much  else.",4,2019,09,04
119,Beware,"I recently booked this hotel for next year, was lead to believe I would be able to pay for the room when I arrived at the hotel but the money has already been taken out of my account. It’s a shame, I was looking forward to staying at this hotel but it has spoilt it for me!",1,2019,09,04
119,Never been so heartbroken or scared,"So where do I even begin...  I tried to call the hotel prior to our stay no answer so when I got into London I tried to call again at this point I wasn’t putting the phone down, 45 minutes I waited for someone to answer I was a bit confused by this considering they were meant to be a good hotel. When we arrive we went up the elevators and we checked in for two nights they took £80 this was for If you used anything in the room or broke anything which we didn’t so that was fine. So we got into our room And went out onto the balcony to be greeted by a man the other side of the glass with his head poking around into our room saying “wogwan” I was instantly nervous my partner was fine with it but it seemed weird… 10/15 minutes went by then the  people next door start arguing there’s two girls in the room and one man the girl hit the man and he shouted “you stupid *female dog* she then replied “I’m no *female dog* the arguments went on and on it was like these two girls were going to be with this one man for the night which whatever floats your boat floats your boat literally so we go  for dinner on the boat I’ve never been anywhere so overpriced in my life a draft beer was about £8/9 My cocktail was £15 then our meals so my pork there was Literally two little bits of pork a potato and three carrots I understand that the more posh the less food there is but come on now I’m not going to get full on that so I asked for extra chips they charge me a £5 for a small portion of chips anyway so we come back up to the room next door their is screaming and arguing still at this point I would’ve thought someone would of call to tell him to shut up But no no one came so I then went to sleep around 11 pm to be woken up at 12:30 to a loud bang and a crying girl with her saying get off of me don’t touch me at this point I had to call reception I was not having this happen all night so reception said okay and put the phone down within about 5/10 minutes there was a loud bang on the door itWas the police to then the girl screaming her head off in the room saying that he had been  abused three times and him saying I didn’t touch her and made me feel very very sick knowing I was next door not having a clue in the world what was happening I’m not sure what that would’ve even sounded like but I think that I was there the whole time and couldn’t do anything but then they kept the man in the room for two hours while they questioned him two hours I had to sit there and listen to his explanation while it’s about 1:30 2 o’clock in the morning the police should’ve took him away and question him elsewhere considering there is paying guests on romantic retreat away but no I will be using my free night that I kind I’m free breakfast due to when I went down the next morning I then said is the man still here what are you going to do about my status now been ruined her reply was oh I’m sorry there was an incident that happened in the night and I said yes I know I was next door then couldn’t sleep 

Anyways I wasn’t going to have 0 compensation for what happen that weekend has scared me for life but other then that the hotel was nice slightly dated",2,2019,09,04
119,Good option for a different experience,"We stayed here prior to flying out of London City Airport the following morning.  It's a prime location for Excel and the 02.
You can't drop off directly outside the ""hotel"" and parking is a short walk away but it's fine.  
We had dinner in the restaurant which was good, (no complaints other than too much mustard with the scotch eggs !)  The children's menu had a good selection and the portions were good.
Our bedroom was large enough for a double bed and sofa bed for the kids, our only issue was that it was quite noisy - you could hear other doors slamming/floor creaking and it was a challenge for us to be quiet at 5am and not wake anyone else up.

119,Mini break,Stayed on board this yacht for one night very nice indeed breakfast was lovely too cabin well it’s more than a cabin it’s huge very comfortable beds. Give it a try you won’t be disappointed also you won’t get seasick as it doesn’t have a engine haha,5,2019,09,03
119,Fantastic experience,Me and my daughter stayed at the Sunborn hotel. The service to rooms and the experience where amazing. Highly recommend for a stay and experience. A little pricey on the food and drinks but amazing experience,5,2019,09,03
119,Amazing stay at the sunborn!,"We came for our wedding anniversary! Staff very polite and welcoming, food amazing, amazing view s from our room and even breakfast over looking the Thames! All in all a very special weekend! Thanks to everyone at the sunborn for looking after us!",5,2019,09,03
119,More P & O ferry than QEII,"I have just been reading the other reviews and I am truly amazed. The concept of this hotel cannot be faulted. When we arrived we were really excited and it certainly has the wow factor, until you actually get inside. This is a hotel that over promises and under delivers. 
Tired, dated and a tad sad. Stained carpets and sofas. 

We had a family room. The room was clean but depressing. The double bed was comfortable but my kids had to share a small sofa bed with just a mattress protector and no mattress! It also kept collapsing at the foot end. 
Incredibly noisy air con and all manner of loud noises from god only knows where. I woke at one point and wondered if they’d fired up the engines and actually set sail.

There is only 1 bar. It was ok. Awful bar food. It was so bad we decided not to risk staying for dinner.

Popular venue for young groups that looked like they had been to their proms. They were the only people smartly dressed. Don’t worry about what to pack. Stay in your joggers and flip flops. You’ll fit right in. 

I have given 3 stars for great location and concept. Staff friendly enough but after waiting 20 mins for service last night ( it was quiet) gave up and went elsewhere.

If you are thinking about staying here.......give it a wide berth and cruise on by!

119,Partners birthday,"Had an amazing stay at Sunborn London hotel, we only stayed for one night for my partners birthday on an executive river room. I told them it was his birthday and they decorated the room for arrival which was perfect.
We visited the restaurant (lands end) and was beautiful and so nice. It is pricey, but you get what you pay for perfectly. Our waitress Ana was so lovely and really made our visit. We got the sharing board and was amazing. Cocktails are also amazing
Would recommend this hotel for sure",5,2019,09,01
119,Great Stay,We were lucky enough to receive an upgrade to a riverside view room with a balcony.  Room was comfortable.  We could only hear the planes when the balcony door was open which was a pleasant surprise given the proximity to city airport.  Would definitely stay again.,5,2019,08,31
119,Great hotel ,"Royal Victoria is a great place to visit and has a nice holiday vibe the Sunborn adds to this perfectly. Transport to central is easy DLR to Canning Town swap to jubilee line or stay on DLR to Tower Hill and ideal spot for visiting the O2 just jump on the air line. Our welcome at the hotel was efficient and friendly, the bed was huge and the room very spacious and Spotlessly clean although just a little note There were a lot of cleaning trollies and used room service trays in the corridors on the walk to the room which does not give a great first impression. The shower and air con were top notch. The outside bar area was a little on the small side but the inside bar was very nice with a lovely relaxed feeling we appreciated the table service and the prices were as expected. Check out was seamless and we will definitely stay again. ",5,2019,08,31
119,"Fabulous few days, made it extra special to celebrate family birthday. We did not want to leave!","Visited here in August for 3 nights, Location was excellent, Both rooms were upgraded on arrival with fantastic river view rooms with balcony. Did not eat in hotel as had other commitments. Hotel helped us celebrate our son's 21st birthday and provided a birthday cake and decorations / balloons for the room, despite me originally cancelling the package due to ill-health, however the hotel were happy to remove the charge when I informed them that it had been cancelled. Rooms were air conditioned and was lovely to sit out on the balcony. Fridge provided in the room which was essential for medicines. Rooms and hotel were exceptionally clean and bathrooms provided toiletries. Close to the Excel and the O2. Easy journey from Euston by tube and the DLR. This hotel is close to London City Airport and not far from the end of the runway so expect aircraft noise. We loved watching the planes so it did not bother us but could imagine that some people would find this quite noisy. We loved this hotel and would definitely like to return.",5,2019,08,28
119,Gorgeous hotel,"Just returned from a fabulous stay at this unique hotel. We booked a river side view and were delighted with our room and the size of the balcony, everything was perfect and very relaxing... until we realised a hen party had arrived in the next couple of rooms to us. I asked at reception if there were any rooms available to swap to and they were very accommodating and understanding and we were promptly moved to a equally lovely room but with a smaller balcony but we were just grateful to have some peace. 

The view from the room was stunning, as well as the river there are views of the o2, cable cars and skyline of the city. The hotel was very easy to find, not far from DLR station custom house. At first we thought we might be a bit far out from the city but it was only a few stops on the DLR. 

I would definitely recommend this hotel to anyone.",5,2019,08,27
119,Outstanding,"Outstanding hotel from the quality of room to the staff, you are made to feel important and valued they couldn't do enough for you. Special shout out to Salomey who looked after us and made our time more enjoyable. I'd recommend the sunborn to anyone who happens to be travelling to London.",5,2019,08,27
119,Perfect,"Wow just stunning. The beds are enormous and super comfortable the rooms are a great size, Tea and coffee making facilities, glasses and water available in the room. We had a drinks on the deck it was just perfect. I would highly recommend booking here. So many places to visit within a short walk. Friendly staff.",5,2019,08,27
119,Husband birthday treat ,"Booked this for my husband birthday as something different to do in London . 
Was greeted by friendly staff , part of our booking was a free welcome cocktail which we didn’t get until we asked for them .
We had to pay £40 which we get back 3-5 working days .. sure didn’t say about that on booking . 
The room was a dock side view with balcony 4025. Very nice , good size , clean . Had fridge , tea coffee, 2 small bottle of water , shampoo - no shower gel tho. 
Great location for DLR , Tube connection. 
Only few points I would say ...

1- I booked this back in July & said it was my husband birthday, I also emailed to confirm this but the boat didn’t honour this in any way which I found a little disappointing .

2- At midnight we had to call reception as our Aircon was not working & was 28c in our room. A man came up to the room to
Look at it & said it wasn’t working and came back with an standing fan . This did help along with the balcony door open but not really ideal as paying money for AC & the noise .When said at reception we were told because of the weather . I explained that it was not working. 

I would stay here again and will let others know about it . It’s also made us want to go on a cruise . 
",4,2019,08,27
119,Fantastic Setting,"Short break stay during August so we could take in a show for my wife's birthday. Excellent facilities you would expect of a top London hotel in a unique setting. Ideal if you are taking in Greenwich, O2 or Excel Centre with a chilled vibe locally. Easy into Town for theatre or restaurants. ",4,2019,08,25
119,Beautiful ,"The boat is absolutely gorgeous.  We had a problem with check in as I had requested in advance a river view room however was allocated a dock view which was very disappointing. We were offered a river view for the next day which we accepted but as we were only there for two nights it was a bit inconvenient to say the least. 

The king size bed was fine in both rooms but I  was sleeping on the sofa bed and they were both like slabs of concrete. Am gonna be on brufen for the next few days !

We sat outside on the lower deck the first night but the staff were not at all proactive in serving us drinks. On four occasions I had to go inside to ask for drinks.  The bottle of Prosecco we had was lovely and cold but very pricey at £40 as were all the drinks. 

We were gutted that there was no peroni on draught available as we looked forward to that but they had run out.

I hope to stay there again later in the year but won’t be sleeping on the sofa bed !!",4,2019,08,25
119,“Stunning”,"Stayed here for a birthday treat and was not disappointed at all.
From the entrance, to the lifts and corridors that lead to your room there was a wow factor.
Rooms spacious and lovely wooden decor.
Staff were friendly and helpful.
Beautiful views from bar terrace.
We will definitely stay here again.",5,2019,08,24
119,Lovely experience,Went for a meal and massage. It's a beautiful site on the Thames and the area nearby is worth a walk round.  Meal was wonderful  and the presentation superb. Even with a voucher choice was good. Service attentive and efficient. Had a massage afterwards which was relaxing although would have liked a little more communication between masseuse and client to ensure one felt at ease and pressures were suitable. ,5,2019,08,24
119,Spa and lunch,"Visited here with Virgin experience which was a present. Spa was lovely, I had a facial and massage with Melissa. Excellent. My husband had back and leg massage and he loved that too. We then had lunch, amazing food and service. All the staff were very friendly and helpful. We had a brilliant time and would highly recommend.",5,2019,08,23
119,Midweek break,"A lovely stay on board so different, friendly staff clean hotel. Away from the hussel and bussel of London but close enough for days out, dlr to Tower gateway on the doorstep. Only fault you have to pay £40 a night deposit so £80 for us, and it is actully taken from your bank not just holding your card number, then you have to wait 5 working days to get it put back into your bank, not happy with this and this is the only reason we will never stay there again ☹☹☹☹☹☹",4,2019,08,23
119,Fantastic experience!,"My partner and I stayed here and the experience blew us away,the yacht itself is absolutely stunning upon entering your greeted with such a warm welcome from very polite and helpful staff,the cabins are more than generous size wise also with access to the balcony with beautiful views of London,there’s access to overhead cable carts a stones throw away which takes you directly to the 02 arena with plentiful bars and restaurants,we also had evening meal on the yacht and although it was quite expensive the food,drinks and service was exceptional I would certainly recommend to anyone and also stay again.",5,2019,08,22
119,Mini break in London,"Fancy something a little different, then this is worth a try. A beautiful place to stay with great views of London. The hotel was perfect, staff really helpful and polite. The whole place was immaculate and what better way to spend an evening drinking a glass of wine on the deck. The breakfast was great too!  Easy to get into central London on the DLR and definitely worth a trip over to Greenwich via the cable car. Definitely recommend. ",5,2019,08,22
119,Beautiful accommodation spoilt by poor customer service and organisation.,"A beautiful floating hotel with a great view by night from the bar and dining room.  We booked direct and paid in full with the hotel 3 rooms in June for our Mothers birthday late in the month of August. We booked for breakfast and dinner on the first evening for the 7 of us. We were told we were entitled to the early oking discounts applied to eating in the restaurant, a room upgrade on arrival, a free cocktail on arrival, discount off treatments etc, etc..

Having had to make several pre-arrival phone calls to book the restaurant for a set time, I was told we must pre-order our meal because we were a party of 7.

On arrival I was told that we need to pay an additional £147 for one of the 3 rooms (which eventually was sorted by my persistence with original paperwork), a £40 deposit per room, no room upgrade was received for any of the rooms, we tried to claim our cocktail in the evening and was advised we needed a voucher, when again I showed the original paperwork they brought the receptionist to us in the bar which said we could have 2 cocktails, then we advised there was 7 of us, eventually we got a bellini each!

The restaurant rang on my mobile 1 hour before our booking to ensure we would be attending our evening reservation even though we the receptionist checked the booking on arrival.The restaurant service was excellently provided by Jennifer, who looked after us very well and nothing was too much trouble for her.

When we booked out we had to return to the receptionist on two further occasions to advise we had not received the entitled early booking discount off dining in the Land End restaurant (which the receptionist advised was our error as we need to tell the restaurant that we booked direct in order to get the discount, eventhough the complete dinner was automatically attached to one of the rooms) but apparently breakfast does not receive a discount although this is served in the restaurant.

Such a shame Sunborn that your customer service and lack of organisation processes do not run seamlessly for us the customer.  Perhaps someone from the organisation reads this and will look at Sunborn as a whole, as Jennifer's excellent service is lost in the failings.",3,2019,08,22
119,One night stay for concert,Staff are really helpful and friendly. Room was clean  and had everything we needed. Bed was very comfortable. The location is A1 for the O2 arena. Would have been nice to have had some shower gel in our room. Also our coffee machine wouldn't work and the curtains were a struggle to close. There was also an annoying noise which I think was the lift. We were late back and so tired it didnt make a difference to us but anyone wanting a relaxing or longer stay might have been bothered by it. ,4,2019,08,20
119,August Three Night Stay on the Sunborn Yacht ,"This is the second time we have stayed on the Sunborn Yacht when attending a three day Convention at Excel and can thoroughly recommend it. The quality of the hotel is excellent, with a nautical influence and it is spotlessly clean. The  Executive Room we booked was spacious and the beds are huge and extremely comfortable. Bathrobes and slippers are provided for additional ease. The small fridge enabled us to stock our own different types of milk and enabled us to stock sandwiches for the following day. The shower room is spaceous and the shower itself is roomy and easy to use, which is great if you're in a hurry.
Being able to spread out and relax on the comfortable sofa in the evening was nice. The open balcony was a really particularly enjoyable feature, where on the starboard side we enjoyed an interesting view over the Dock. 
Self-service breakfast  (which is available from 6:30am) and the coffee were excellent and convenient. We had aged parents with us and the staff were particularly kind and helpful. The way the Yatch is designed provides good security. look forward to returning next year.",5,2019,08,19
119,Brilliant Afternoon Tea and British Classic Movie,"Came here on a lazy Sunday afternoon with my daughters for afternoon tea and a classic British Movie. The Italian Job. The Yacht restaurant was superb. The inside was decorated in a nautical style and it was quite opulent looking. The afternoon tea had a wide selection of sandwiches, cakes, macaroons, pans cotta and scones. There was a good choice of vegetarian options. The service was great, very happy looking attentive staff. A good selection of teas and three different types of champagne. We never felt rushed at any stage and we had a chilled afternoon! We then had some drinks at the bar which was also waiter service. A strawberry daiquiri went down a treat! Then came the British Classic Movie. We picked The Italian Job as you can’t get more classic than that. My only issue was the sound quality had some static when there was a loud noise in the movie. But it didn’t spoil my fun. Fantastic day. Next time I’ll try the spa!",5,2019,08,18
119,Different type of Hotel,"Have just been to London for a two day visit and decided to stay st this very nice Hotel. We went on recommendation and were not disappointed. From a nice welcome and easy book in, we went to our room over looking the dock and river. Lovely big room and balcony. Everything was clean and well presented. 
We decided to eat out locally, but will  point out that the restaurant looked nice,
On our return we sat out on the balcony, we had hoped to sit on the rear deck but unfortunately the weather put paid to that.
Had a lovely sleep in a large bed which was very comfortable.
Went and had breakfast which was included in our deal, 
And I must say it has to be one of the best hotel breakfasts that I have ever had. 
The only possible downside, was that the boats location is directly under the flight path of London’s City Airport.
Wasn’t a prob for us as we like seeing the planes.
Pretty sure they don’t fly during the night.
My wife and I were both of the opinion that next time we will stay longer.
Very close to the cable car over the river and O2 and 2-3
Mins walk from the DLR system.",5,2019,08,17
119,Afternoon tea.,"The setting with views out over The 02 etc, is very nice, the staff were very friendly and helpful too, the food and tea excellent, although there was a long wait for it once sat down, the waitress did apologise twice for it.

The biggest problem at the Sunborn is parking, or rather the expense of it, due to its location next to the Excel centre, on the dockside. That said if you travel by different means..??

I really don’t like the practice of adding a service charge to my bill, I would have happily tipped at my own discretion tbh.
(Also a ten minute wait due to there being only one card reader machine working, come on guys.!)

Overall the experience a 4, parking my problem, card machine, long wait, service charge not.!

119,Afternoon Tea,"Range of delicious sandwiches and cakes with option of drinks. Salomey and other staff were very attentive. 

I was celebrating my birthday and a candled cake was brought to the table to wish happy birthday.

Warm welcoming atmosphere to eat and enjoy spectacular views from the yacht. 

Unique experience perfectly served.",5,2019,08,17
119,Massage and afternoon tea,"Just got back from an amazing massage with  Nicola followed by afternoon tea. A massive thank you to Salomey who took care of our every need during afternoon tea. She was friendly, welcoming, attentative and accommodating.",5,2019,08,15
119,Amazing Spa Treatment and Afternoon Tea Treat for my Birthday!,"As a first time visitor to the Sunborn, I can confirm that I was not disappointed.

From the moment I stepped on board, the Customer Service was top-class by the staff at the reception, the bar, the spa, and the restaurant.

I had a very relaxing and much-needed spa treatment in the Symphony Spa, the lady who attended to me, was very helpful and professional and some advice she gave me also afterwards about de-stressing was very useful.

After my treatment, I enjoyed a lovely Afternoon Tea out on Deck (due to the weather being marvellous on the day), which was very, very nice with the added glass of Prosecco and a lovely added surprise, from the kitchen staff with a chocolate cake and ice-cream with Happy Birthday on it! :)

An experience I would most definitely do again on the Sunborn, perhaps throwing in an overnight stay too.

The service by all was superb, which is why I asked the manager if there was a feedback form I could complete, thankfully he advised to use Tripadvisor for my review.",5,2019,08,14
119,My birthday treat. ,"Booked this after it being recommended by a friend. The ideal occasion arose for my birthday so we booked. Arrived early and luggage was stored until check in time for us. When we checked in we were informed that we had been upgraded to a riverside executive room instead of the dockside double (did the know it was my birthday). Huge well appointed room with facilities you would expect in a five star property so exceeded all expectations.  We both agreed it was the best nights sleep we have had in a long time, the bed and the pillows are so comfortable we woke totally refreshed. Can’t comment of food as we dinner plans elsewhere. But the service in the bar was great as we had a mid afternoon drink with fantastic views. All staff were so friendly and helpful. If you want something different then this is the place for you. ",5,2019,08,14
119,Most noisy hotel ever,"Sadly this this seemingly novel idea has transpired to be an all out disaster.
Walls are like paper and wobble when someone in another room slams the door.
You can hear stomping around all across the boat during the night, utterly insane. 
No sockets for plugging in UK plugs - you need an adapter.
Small TV, alarming at this price.
Noisy Air conditioning unit cannot be turned off all night - has to remain on to ""circulate air in the room""",1,2019,08,12
119,FABULOUS AFTERNOON TEA,"Superb venue - third visit and have stayed overnight, had dinner and now Afternoon Tea with 6 clients.  Venue, food, service, staff, faultless.  Can't wait to return and must not forget to mention our first class waiter Marvin - thanks M for looking after our clients so well.",5,2019,08,12
119,Simply wonderful,A superb hotel with a difference.  Highly recommend.  Stayed 2 nights. Great location. Wonderful view. Comfortable bed.  Extremely clean.  Spacious room.  Well equipped. Wonderful atmosphere. Lovely staff.  We only had hot breakfast which was cooked to perfection but a good variety of cold options available.  It was a shame we only stayed 2 nights.  Will hopefully book again soon as my daughter and I did not want to leave. ,5,2019,08,11
119,18th wedding anniversary,"I'm so glad me & my husband booked this for our 18th wedding anniversary. We paid £158 on hotels.com & it was worth every penny.The room was clean,spacious & came a balcony, robes,slippers & a mini fridge with water.I can't wait to come back",5,2019,08,11
119,Graduation Party,"Last month we booked the Sky Lounge for my daughter's graduation party, in addition to the executive suites for a night. It was a brilliant experience, the staff were very friendly and helpful during the planning process and on the night. They went above and beyond to ensure that everything went according to plan. The guests at the party were very impressed by the venue, and it was an unforgettable experience for everyone. We would like to thank Oana and Gintare for all of their help and planning in making our daughter's day special. We will definitely be coming back soon.",5,2019,08,10
119,Beautiful birthday trip,"We stayed for my birthday and arrived around 2.30pm. We were allowed to check in early and upgraded so we had a balcony! So grateful for this as the balcony overlooking the river is amazing. Lovely views of the 02 and the planes flying over. The room was spacious and comfortable. We had dinner in the restaurant and had the set menu which was delicious and good value for money. We were served by Marvin who couldn’t do enough to help us. Overall we had a wonderful stay that felt like a proper holiday, not a trip to London. It is a bit far out from the city centre but we didn’t find it a problem. It was nice to stay somewhere unique. It was clean, good value for money and the staff were incredibly helpful. We’ll be returning.",5,2019,08,09
119,Great place to stay. Would recommend to family and friends,"Stayed here for just one night and thoroughly enjoyed it. Very well appointed and clean room with all amenities. There's a nice bar and the drinks, although not cheap, are acceptable in a place as good as this. Breakfast was fine.
Perhaps the only drawback is the location - a little out of town - but of course its very near Excel and the O2 if you were attending an event there.
Would we go back? Yes!",5,2019,08,07
119,Ultimate Experience,Me and my friends stayed overnight on the Saturday in May as we had weekend tickets to MCM Expo what I can tell people what I've been told by the staff of sunborn before is you can smoke on the balcony which is located outside the restaurant where you'd grab breakfast and from my experience of staying at the Sunborn what I can explain is if your going out for the day say whilst they are clearing your room or say the last guest vacates the room fear not because the Sunborn has a storage room where you can just ask the front desk if you can keep your luggage,5,2019,08,07
119,Sunday night stay,"The hotel/yacht was clean and in very good order.
Paid £110.00.online.for a cabin for 2. Reasonable for London prices. Checked in at 3.00 pm. Room has dreswing, slippers,water and tea and coffee. Toiletries also in the bathroom. All very good.cold 
Breakfast buffet 15.00 continental. Hot Buffett 20.00. Very good.
Snacks available in the bar also.
Drinks very expensive. Beware. Typical round of drinks for 4 is £50 roughly. Even soft drinks will leave a hole in your wallet.  
Not close really to see any sites. You would need a taxi.
A good restful time.",4,2019,08,07
119,Unique venue ,"We really liked the authenticity of Sunborn London. Beautiful  decor and great staff. It was lovely to spend some time on the rear terraces of the bar and restaurant. The rooms were spacious. 3 things to improve - ensure the in room ""tablet"" everyone spoke about is actually there. Place the coffee machine and kettle next to plugs where they can be used - the coffee machine was by 2 pin euopean ones. Ensure the additional blankets don't have chew gum on - clearly overlooked but a bit of  shock!.",4,2019,08,06
119,Amazing Experience,"Stayed here for one night to celebrate my partners birthday, and what a fantastic experience. 

We were given a complementary upgrade to an Executive River view room, and the room was luxurious, comfortable and just how a cabin on a ship should look. The shower was one of the best we have ever had at a hotel.

Yes, the bar prices were expensive, but we didn't mind because sitting, relaxing with a drink taking in the view from the aft deck was something that will stay with us for a long time. 

We would definitely stay here again and love the concept of a ship/hotel. ",5,2019,08,06
119,Not for us...,"I know this is probably popular with a lot of people, but for the 4 of us we weren't overly impressed.

I was expecting to be wowed, but this wasnt the case.

The bar is so expensive, and the drinks are tiny.  £12 for one cocktail that tasted more lime lemonade.  Buffet breakfast £19.95 - was over priced for quality.

We felt isolated where we were and left with a hefty bill.

We wouldnt return again, neither would the couple we were with.",2,2019,08,06
119,Peace in the city,"We only stayed one night and will definitely return. So nice to feel so relaxed in the city. Room was a really good size and we enjoyed early evening drinks sat outside on the rear of the yacht. We had continental breakfast in the room, plenty of food for the price. ",5,2019,07,31
119,Fantastic,"We had the most amazing time. From check in, very friendly and quick.. to our lovely room.. spacious, very clean, nice view of the docs and fantastic breakfast. Our only complaint is that we only stayed one night. Lucky to live 25 miles away from location so we're already planning our next visit with a longer stay. Thank you to all the staff. Regards Paul & Vikki",5,2019,07,31
119,Fantastic,"Taken by my girlfriend for a treat and what a treat it was. Wonderful hotel, so different and exciting to be in. Just like a real super yacht, plenty of bling in the interior and the room we had on the 5th floor overlooking the dock was fantastic. Lovely staff and the breakfast was the full monty. Just great.",5,2019,07,30
119,Nice stay - we didn't take enough adavntage!,"Stayed here as a birthday treat!
Lovely reception - very snazzy. Quick check in.
We had a king room with a river view.
Clean room, comfy bed.
Although very nice having air con on such a warm weekend - it was so noisy!
Kept waking me up most of the night, which is a shame as the bed was so comfy.
Loved the style of the room - really made me think of what a boat/cruise would look like.
We didn't manage to get to the bar / restaurant as we were so tired which is such a shame! Would love to come back & experience that.
Only thing I would say is location is a bit long to get in & out of the heart of London, Piccadilly Circus etc. Probably about half hour on the tube.
Would love to come back but the price is quite high to return for just a regular visit.",4,2019,07,29
119,There's No Place Like Home,"Had an amazing afternoon lunch tour onboard. The Golden Hour is DEFINITELY when the magic happens. Gratitude to Gintare, Gabrielle and Timea for making me feel right at home. Keep those Sunborn Iced Teas coming! ",4,2019,07,28
119,Something different ,"Booked as an alternative to your normal
Hotel and always wanted to look on a yatch rooms were spacious and comfortable did think there would be larger area as to chill out in other than one bar behind reception where drinks were very expensive 
But all in all a good experience ",4,2019,07,26
119,London overnight stop,"We had planned a couple of days in London and decided to stay on the Sunborn , from arrival we were greeted by lovely helpful staff , our room wAs beautiful , spacious and clean , the bar and terrace were great , we sat and watched the sun set and again for breakfast, where we enjoyed our breakfast on the terrace , we were close to the underground so travelling was really easy , I would definitely recommend to stay here as we will definitely return , and very good value for money . ",5,2019,07,23
119,Bad customer service.,"We had a 2 night stay at Sunborn Yacht Hotel from the 14th-16th July. I am writing in the hope that the negatives of this experience can be changed. I would also like you to be aware that we do go away a lot and have high expectations, due to the high amounts we pay. We are happy to pay large amounts, as long as the customer service is provided, hence my view on this experience is justified and is in comparison to the same standards of the establishments we have stayed at. 

For review, I will not disclose the names of the employees as it is unprofessional, and I do not wish for future guests to have a negative view of employees.

Initially, I planned this surprise stay for my fiancé’s birthday and had planned on booking a dinner, afternoon tea and treatments during our stay. I had very high hopes as the place looks amazing and we were quite sure the customer service would match the quality of the hotel, however we were quite wrong.

When booking our stay, I decided to book through the hotel directly as usually you receive a better package, and it is always my preferred method of booking our stays. I also ALWAYS pay the balance beforehand to avoid any additional hassle and in this situation I was EXTREMELY grateful that I had paid fully before our arrival.

As you do a price match, I emailed over the best rate I was receiving online and booked directly through the hotel over the phone. I was told we would receive a complimentary upgrade depending on the availability. We had booked a dockside view and were told we would be able to receive a complimentary upgrade to riverside if there was availability.

On arrival, we were checked-in, and had horrendous service. Infront of my fiancé (please bear in mind that it was his birthday and he was appalled at the service, especially as literally a few moments before this he was surprised and extremely happy that I had chosen Sunborn), she told me I had only paid for one night and needed to pay the balance for the next night, her manner of speaking and tone was rude. I repeatedly showed her my confirmation email, where it stated I had paid in full for 2 nights. I believe she was trying to make me pay an additional fee, which is ridiculous, as I fail to understand how an employee is refusing to understand the situation, especially when there is written documentation and proof being provided. Another employee then intervened and explained to her that I had paid and it was evident that she was not happy about being wrong; this was all extremely embarrassing and horrendous, hence it got to a point where I had to ask my partner to go take a seat whilst I resolved this issue. 

After this issue had been resolved, I asked if we would be receiving the complimentary upgrade as discussed, and she stated it had been applied, hence I quickly paid the deposit (£40 per night) and we went to our room as I really did not wish to speak to her any longer. 

When we arrived at our room, we saw that it had not been upgraded, and by this point my fiancé and I were quite fed up with everything. We simply could not understand how an amazing hotel could have such bad customer service. I then went back down to the reception and spoke to another employee, who upgraded us to the correct room, I also asked about reservations for dinner, treatments and so on, and decided to book these after having a quick discussion with my fiancé; we then moved our luggage to the new room and I had to return to reception once again to return the keycard for the first room, I also had the intention of making the reservations as planned. Whilst doing so, I walked into reception and overheard three employees (including the 2 employees I had spoken to), gossiping and discussing the feedback I had given the second employee quite loudly. As you can assume, I was very unimpressed, and decided I would not waste time and any more money on this establishment as the customer service was horrendous and very unprofessional. We then ordered Deliveroo and from the local restaurants for the rest of our stay as I did not wish to speak to the employees anymore. 

I would also advise housekeeping to pay attention to detail as there was a disgusting ball of hair in front of our en-suite (I do have a picture of this, but won't attach it here) and as we did not wish to touch this or speak to the employees again, it simply sat there until the end of our stay, which was unappealing. 

In order to improve the quality of your customer service, I really do advise thorough training for employees and more importantly, ensure the employees are credible and polite during the recruitment process. I have never been so unimpressed with the quality of customer service. 

In regard to the establishment itself, it is a beautiful hotel with amazing views. The chandelier at reception gives it an amazing look, and the views were very relaxing. From the outside, we noticed the bar and restaurant were located in amazing locations, and would have been a brilliant experience, however unfortunately we were unable to experience them in person. We were also promised a bathtub, however upon arrival we were told by the second employee there are only 2 bathtubs, which are located in the suites. The bathrooms were clean and had nice toiletries (not Molten Brown as promised, but still very nice). The robes and slippers were extremely comfy, and the room itself was very homely which is a nice touch. The bed was very comfortable, and having the sofa and balcony was really lovely as it provided a comfortable area to eat and relax. 

We could not use the TV as we could not use it as a smart TV and did not have any HDMI cables, hence we stuck to using our laptop and iPad, and also the coffee machine was not the best, however they did provide a lovely selection of tea’s. The fridge was also unstocked, hence we did not get to use the mini bar; if the employees were helpful and happy to help, we would usually ask for help, but in this situation, I did not want to ruin or add anymore negativity to my fiancé’s birthday, hence I did not bother contacting employees for anything. 

Overall, I would have been extremely happy to pay the price I had if I received nice customer service, however in this instance I believe it wasn’t as worth it as I assumed. Customer service is crucial and can make the world of difference to a situation. 

I have also emailed my feedback to the hotel in an attempt for it to be recognised, however have had no response so far.",3,2019,07,22
119,What an amazing place !!!,"Absolutely loved my stay here with me and my partner,
The rooms where completely spotless not one spec of dust, massive bed, lovely views from balcony.
Customer service was fantastic, staff very helpful and polite, the drinks where a bit expensive it was 7 quid for two bottles of lemonade which I thought was a bit excessive.
I will definitely be staying here again this year, such a lovely experience",5,2019,07,22
119,Excellent for O2 or Excel visit,"Check in was quick and easy, Joanna was brilliant and she kindly printed out my tickets for a concert.  My printer had decided to pack up.  Our room was an upgraded executive suite on the second floor with a balcony and dockside view.  The rooms are a lovely size and you have either a dockside or river view.  I love staying here and will always try to book it when visiting the O2 or Excel.  

There are good transport links via the DLR into London.  For the O2 you change at Canning Town to the underground or you can take the Emirates Air Line that is a short walk away and takes you over the water to just outside the O2.

Would I stay here again? Definitely

Would I recommend it to a friend? Absolutely, already have.",5,2019,07,17
119,"Something a little different, away from the busyness of Central London","Usually we would stay in Central London, somewhere like The Strand Palace hotel. However, we didn't realise it was both Pride and mid-Wimbledon weekend - the prices were going up by the hour for all hotels in the centre! So, we really wouldn't normally have considered somewhere like the Sunborn but I am glad we found it. 

As the hotel is next door to the Excel, I guess it can get quite busy but there were no events at the Excel that particular weekend. We opted to travel to North Greenwich tube then hop on the Emirate cable car to get over the river, it seemed a lot easier than the journey suggested which had more changes. From the Emirates cable car it was less than 5 minutes to walk to the Sunborn Yacht hotel. There are shops, cafe's, bars and restaurants in the immediate area giving plenty of food & drink options. 

Check-in was easy, the ladies on reception were really welcoming, cheerful and nothing was too much trouble for them.  We'd arrived before the room was ready so had a drink out on the deck - yes, it was expensive but not that far off from usual London prices.  London City Airport runway is a little way beyond the hotel, you can easily see the runway but the noise wasn't disruptive. On the opposite side of the hotel from the airport you have a lovely view of Greenwich peninsular and the City of London financial district.

We had a room with a balcony on the top floor, riverside. It was actually rather nice. Very clean throughout, nothing tatty or old-fashioned about it. Our room had a very comfortable king-size bed, coffee maker (more coffee pods were supplied at no extra cost), fridge, even some books in a cabinet if you fancied a read. 

Instead of the traditional information folder, an in-room tablet was provided with all hotel details plus relevant websites of local events, travel and so on.

The bathroom had a walk-in shower and a shower head next to the loo for personal hygiene use - well, I suppose you could have used it to wash your hair over the sink too if you felt so inclined!

We had booked 2 nights including breakfast. This is the one thing which let them down a little. The fried eggs - inedible. Not sure if they had just been left out for too long but the yolk had a hard shell on top and the whites were tough, like cutting into meat. How on earth do you get tough egg whites? That said, the bacon, sausage (I very rarely eat sausages but these were pretty good) and the rest of the hot food selection was plentiful and of a good standard - including scrambled eggs. The continental selection again offered plenty of choice and I particularly liked the individual jars of condiments, jam as usual but also Heinz ketchup, mustard, brown sauce and more.

As it was so warm on the first night, we sat out on our balcony (with some contraband purchased at Tesco Extra around the corner). It was quite peaceful and relaxing. The financial district skyline looked impressive when lit up!

The second night of our stay we decided to eat in the restaurant. The set menu was only available on certain days so that wasn't an option but the restaurant - despite being very good - was vastly overpriced compared to some of the better known London restaurants. We'd eaten a late lunch so decided to skip the starter and chose the Salt Marsh lamb, it was melt in the mouth, and a good sized portion.  For dessert we had the stick toffee pudding, absolutely divine, in fact so good, I forgot to take a photo before I tucked in!

All in all, we really enjoyed the stay and would stay again. I do understand other reviewers complaining about private parties interfering with an expected level of service for guests and had that happened to us, I'd have been giving some negative feedback too. But our experience was quieter, all the staff - reception, dining room for dinner & breakfast, bar - were lovely.  Forewarned is forearmed though - next time we will be sure to ask if they are hosting any events before we book.",5,2019,07,16
119,very disapointing,"Having stayed several times on the sister boat in Gibraltar, we were really excited to be celebrating our 30th Wedding Anniversary here. How disappointed were we. 

Arriving on board you have a confusing lift entrance. We arrive in reception to blaring music from a private party upstairs, we checked in, nearly unable to hear what the receptionist was saying. We took the lift into the bowels of the ship to our room. The lift lobby on our floor clearly had had people smoking marijuana in it or adjacent rooms because of the overpowering smell. 

We arrive in our room (room 1046) and to be honest we were very disappointed. The room would have not out of place in the 1980s, very dark with little light from the tiny porthole ( different in the morning) a small bathroom with the whole room having a rather tired feel. The difference to ourrooms in Gibraltar like night and day. We found out by the morning that the air conditioning is not controllable. Even when turned off the room was like a ice box. The curtains do not shut properly so the dark room gets flooded with light at 4.30am.

 Frozen and been awake since 4.30 am we go to breakfast. It’s expensive (£19 for cooked, £14 for continental ) but from our experience of sister boats we were really looking forward to it and happy to pay. This breakfast was simply one of the worst I have ever had. For a luxury hotel using powdered eggs, raw sausages, cheap bread, urn delivered tea, instant coffee, stale pastries is not really what you want or pay for. The staff were slow at topping up anything so it was half empty. I did complain and refuse to pay for this. Dont eat here, its expensive and poor quality- there are several really good places open for breakfast just off the boat. We were planning to eat our second nights meal here, so glad we ""experienced"" breakfast first and went else where

On the first night we decided to go for a drink in the bar. the upstairs bar was closed for a private function ( not told about this on booking) Went to order a drink but was told it was table service only, nice touch we thought. got a table outside ( great view over docklands) and waited and waited and waited, all the time being ""entertained"" by a number of vulgar customers who were simply rude to staff and customers alike. 25 minutes later we were given a menu which then took another 25 minutes to get a drink. The drinks are expensive and barely adequate. Be warned the automatically add a 12.5% service charge to your bill for every drink.

On our last night we returned from the theater and wanted to get a drink only to be confronted by the whole boat  in a black tie private function ( less the top deck bar  however most the people there were in black tie too) Again we were  not told about this and felt distinctly uncomfortable being there, surrounded by people in long dresses and black tie. We decided to take a drink in our rooms and requested ice to be bought down. This took a hour to deliver by which time we had gone to bed!!!

This hotel is NOT a luxury hotel in terms of quality of amenities or staffing Staff are politely indifferent for the most part. It is like the difference between night and day when compared with their sister boat in Gibraltar. Such a pity that brand doesn't have universal standards. Its nothing more that a 3 star ""ok"" experience and definitely not worth the 5 star price tags. There are far, far better hotels in London for less money.

 I wouldn't stay here again   and Im so angry that what for us was a special event left totally deflated",2,2019,07,15
119,Long weekend away and to see a show,"We arrived at the Sunborn on Friday 12th July late pm.
Check in was a good experience.
Room we had 4028 was a lovely room, old looking but was on the boating theme.
Room extremely clean and in good order.
We went for late lunch and food was good.
We had an evening meal and the food and service excellent.
Saturday came and we went out for the day and to see a show and in the evening we had an Italian meal at Covent gardens knowing the Sunborn was having a private function and no evening meal was available.
We got back after a lovely day to find that the boat was closed to guests on two floors and no bar.
We were put on the top floor with a make shift bar with no more than 3 or 4 drink choices and no cocktails.
Well I'm sorry but this was not acceptable to be confined like this as we had paid a lot of money to be on this boat.
In my opinion the boat should have been closed to all guests if a function of this size is to be held. Why should individual guests suffer.
This I'm afraid spoilt the whole experience for us after such a good start.
The other negative is we didn't pre-book breakfast which wasn't a problem as we paid as we went.
I do object to being given the bill after 2 or 3 mouthfuls of breakfast, this is very rude and should stop. The bill should be given after eating breakfast, no different to when you have an evening meal.
Also be careful what taxi company you use through Sunborn as it cost us with Nazeem cars £50 to get in to London but only £35 to get back with the black cabs.
Overall it was a good stay, but we will not be returning as this location is tooooooo far away to enjoy the attractions of lomdon.",3,2019,07,14
119,Average at best.,"We arrived on late on friday night. Checked into the hotel, interior is dated in rooms, I understand it's to keep in with the yacht theme but I still found it rather old looking as opposed to classic. Ordered room service pizza and a salad for my boyfriend. Water with ice and lemon. The pizza came with no dip as I requested, no salad, no ice and lemon. The pizza was like a frozen pizza with rocket on the top. The next day I was woken up to drilling and hammering at 8am which was annoying. we had drinks on the top deck around teatime on the satueday, went to get a pint as per menu and was told they don't do pints. Ordered drinks and the order was wrong, ordered more drinks to which the barman asked me to repeat so he could write it down. They were the wrongs drinks that came out again. Breakfast average at best. Bed comfy and Aircon in room is perfect which sadly is the best part of what could be an unreal hotel. So so so disappointed considering we paid around £530 for two nights with breakfast. Absolutely NOT WORTH IT and would never return",2,2019,07,14
119,THE best service,"I have just recently stayed at the Sunborn hotel with my Partner, Dad and brother. We had the best time. The hotel/yacht itself is lovely, the rooms are pretty big, nice bed, TV, seating area and shower room. The rooms were clean and tidy, as was the rest of the hotel. The lobby and bar were also great. However, these are not the best thing about the hotel, the staff are. We were checked in by Ilona, who was so polite and patient, my Dad runs a business and often travels to the ExCel, she spent time with him making future bookings, asking about his work and generally answering all his questions. We also spoke with Joanna, who was also amazing. She was friendly and chatty, she asked about why we were in London for the evening, she overheard me ask my partner for a chewing gum, and when he didn't have one, she went and found me some after only overhearing our conversation. She also got me a pad and paper when I asked, when my Dad made a joke about wanting a pen too, she went out of her way to find him the last one at reception. The next day she asked us about our concert, the drive home, where we came from. She couldn't have been nicer, one of the nicest reception staff I have ever met. We also had the pleasure of meeting Jackie. She served us for dinner, drinks and also when we got back to the hotel. Her personality was the best, she was so helpful, her whole persona was amazing. She made us laugh, she helped us out, she chatted, she was generally great. She also took an interest in us, asked about our evening and our day. I would make her employee of the month.. hint hint. All the other staff we dealt with were amazing too but i didn't get their names. We only stayed one night, but they all took an interest, they remembered what we were doing, where we came from, our surname. We even called when we were stuck at the o2 around 11.30 and the staff emailed us directions to get back to the hotel on the tube, the estimated cost and a taxi number, they couldn't have done anymore. The staff really made the stay, they were phenomenal. Id give them all a pay rise ;-)",5,2019,07,13
119,Fabulous,"Stayed one night for a 40th birthday treat - fabulous! Staff couldn’t do enough, especially Lidia who was lovely to us. Felt very spoilt and pampered as we were off on our holidays. Room and hotel were amazing. Many thanks to all and hope to see you again very soon!",5,2019,07,11
119,Spa treatment and afternoon tea,"Visited the Sunborn yesterday for a spa treatment and afternoon tea with my daughter, although the treatment was delayed we were made vary welcome by the receptionist, and then both had a lovely massage and exceptional facial, the best I have had in a long time, and I use spas regular;y wherever I travel.

We then set outside at the bar/lounge and enjoyed a nice coffee,served by a very helpful young man, before going down to the restaurant for afternoon tea.  This was exceptional, everything tasted perfect, and the waitress could not have been more helpful.

I would recommend this to anyone and would love to go back to stay and enjoy a lunch or dinner.",5,2019,07,11
119,Totally Memorable Weekend,"We stayed here Friday 5th & Saturday 6th July to celebrate my Wife’s special Birthday and our 41st Wedding Anniversary. 
From the moment we arrived everything was fantastic.
Every member of the staff was friendly, efficient and totally professional.
Our room had been specially decorated with towel-art, balloons, banners, chocolates and a cake.
The room itself was large, elegantly furnished and immaculately clean with a huge and very comfortable bed.
Both ladies in our party visited the Spa for the Signature Treatment and were totally delighted.
The bar and terrace has table-service and although all the staff there were excellent we have to make a special mention of Jackie. She is a little bundle of joy with a smile that lights up the room and such a sweet and genuine nature – a definite asset to the team.
Food in the restaurant was excellent and plentiful both for breakfast and our A-La-Carte dinner on Saturday. 
All in all we had a wonderful stay and will be back.
Thank you Sunborn London for making our Special occasion an event so memorable it will always be in our hearts.
",5,2019,07,08
119,Lovely place but be careful ,"Booked this a couple of months ago as a short surprise break, we drove up as they had a few disabled parking spaces nearby and that would be the best option.
On arrival we were made very welcome by the reception staff and the foyer was lovely, as my wife walks with a stick we were given a room nearby, it was quite spacious, clean and well laid out.
We never ate there that night as there are a few restaurants close by, but we came back later in the evening for a couple of drinks.
The lounge was comfy with views around the dock but the drinks I thought were a bit pricey £9 a pint and £10 a vodka.
Next morning we went for breakfast but when I asked for a pot of tea I was told to help myself( we thought for the price it would have been waiter service) so we left and went to a nearby restaurant, served to our table and half the price.
On checking out the bill was confusing as they take money from your account on arrival and also up front for the room, the drinks the night before had a service charge on, so they had overcharged when in fact they owed me money, anyway I pointed it out and all was sorted.
I would recommend this place to stay as overall it was good but we just thought it was a four star hotel with five star prices.",4,2019,07,07
119,Sunborn,"I just had to come on site and review this spectacular luxury yacht hotel.It was top class. My bedroom was massive more of a suite and luxurious. The bed was super comfy and lots of elegant wardrobe space. The bar lounge was superb and on the warm evening that it was you could go out on deck and sit overlooking the docks and the 02. Very relaxing. The staff were excellent and highly professional especially the bar area manager. The reception staff were warm friendly and very professional. The breakfast manager was very professional and courteous and my eggs Benedict was second to none
All in all it was a very enjoyable stay and superb value for money",5,2019,07,07
119,Wow! Wow! Wow! ♥️ ,"This is the best hotel in London! Prices are excellent, I have stayed with my mom for a weekend and honestly I am so happy we found this place. We felt special from the beginning to the end. The room was lovely, super clean with most comfortable bed I have ever slept on! Bathroom was very clean. Reception was very helpful in directing us to nice places in central London, so we have great day out as well. We tried food room service as well and in 20 min was delivered to our room! We are so happy with our stay that acually was sad to leave! Illona and Vigantas who checked us out was verry sweet and friendly. Overall I had the best stay ever in London! And definitely will back there and will recomend this peace of heaven in London to everyone!!",5,2019,07,06
119,First visit to London,"First visit to London and I wasn't left disappointed.  Beautiful, well laid out room with a balcony.  Spotlessly clean from floor to ceiling.  Comfortable bed with fresh crisp bedding.  Lovely view across the Thames.  Dined in the restaurant one night and had a tasty meal.  Service was excellent with extremely helpful and polite staff.  Transport is easily accessible from the Hotel with very short waiting times.  Overall this is the perfect Hotel to come home to after a busy day in London with the calmness and quiet it has to offer being on the Thames.  I will be highly recommending this Hotel.",5,2019,07,05
119,Afternoon Tea,"Visited the Sunborn for afternoon tea with my Dad. We were staying overnight at Novotel Excel 1 minute away (excellent hotel btw) so probably better staying there given the not so good reviews on the yacht's accommodation ....???
Our afternoon tea was definitely one of the best we have had. Very fresh sandwiches, lovely warm scones and beautiful desserts. Totally delicious, sadly we couldn't finish it all !! Waiters were very pleasant and attentive.
The foyer and beautiful staircase up to the Lands End restaurant were immaculate.
The restaurant itself again was immaculate, beautiful white linen.
Great place to enjoy tea or whatever. Would visit again
The only thing that spoils the docks in our opinion is the rather ugly black iron cranes.... understand why they're there but maybe too many of them ? Spoils the view",5,2019,07,05
119,Stop over ,"A different feel to an “in transit” hotel. Good location for  access to LCY and getting around London. Recommend for business or pleasure - the yacht caters for both audiences. Close by you have a wonderful Italian restaurant Zero Sette and for Breakfast there’s a choice of local Cafe’s. If you like your Costa Coffee, pop in to Excel! ",4,2019,07,05
119,Fabulous,"Stayed just for one night for meeting at excel. Absolutely perfect location for this part of town.
Room was lovely, spacious, clean and well appointed.
Very quiet
Balcony was fab
One of the nicest places I have stayed for quite  while and highly recommended",5,2019,07,04
119,Fabulous,"Booked an executive king room which was delightful..spotlessly clean with large comfy bed and great veiws of the Thames from the balcony.Spent a delughtful afternoon sipping cocktails on the deck served by a lovely phillipino little waitress who couldn't do enough for us.Weather was superb ..which helped..but bar area was lovely so would not have been a problem if not.Delicious sandwich ordered..big enough for two to share..yes..pricey..but hey ho you don't book to stay here and expect it to be anything less.We had a delicious set menu 3 course meal in the restaurant..again..the staff were delightful..and a lovely breakfast from the buffet the next morning which had a great choice.Something for everyone.
Overall..a great stay. ..well worth the money for a special occasion or treat..really cannot understand the poor reviews on here..We would go back without hesitation.Well done Sunborn..big thumbs up from us.Thank you.",5,2019,07,03
119,Great experience ,"Booked a Sunday night stay as a surprise for my wife. Easy online booking. Very close to the DLR railway network. Very friendly and helpful front desk. Booked into room 5030 with a balcony overlooking the river. Great room with everything as described online. The only problem we encountered, was the air-conditioning was not working properly and it was a roasting hot day outside. We were provided with a fan, and the staff did all they could to make us comfortable. We didn't eat there, but had coffee on the terrace in the morning and the breakfast looked good.The Sunborn is a quirky change to other hotels in London and we loved it.",5,2019,07,03
119,Fun place to stay!,"It's in a great position in the Docklands, easy to get to the O2 across the water or into Canary Wharf or into central London. We had booked a standard room but were very lucky to be upgraded to a room with a balcony which was lovely. Very spacious room, I think the same size as the the standard but those rooms only have a small porthole.
Was so nice in the morning sitting on the balcony watching the runners go past and seeing London wake up.
We didn't eat on board so can't comment on the food. Had drinks in the bar at the end of the evening which was expensive. We didn't stay long as  there was a noisy crowd who were quite drunk and kept chasing their child around the bar! Not the hotels fault of course!
Overall nice hotel in an excellent and peaceful part of London.",4,2019,07,03
119,Needs a new manager as this place could be so good .... but isn't,"1 family room and 1 double room, nice enough large rooms. TBH cant fault rooms or obviously the hotel location. I booked this hotel as we had previously visited and had breakfast at the Sunborn in Gibralter and thought this would be the same..alas ... its smaller than the GIB one but fine. all is OK until you meet any member of staff. At check in we were first told rooms were ready (1pm) then we were told that we couldnt check in until 3pm as standard !!! The guy who took our bags was lovely :-) Then I had to pay a £20 pp deposit - i assumed this was in case we radied the mini bar but no it is in case we decided to have the over priced breakfast (mini bar was empty fridge !)  ... threw bags in room at 3pm and headed out to London stadium and girls into town. As i said great location is great and DLR a 5 minute walk ... after we got back at 11.20 we decided as London town was so busy we would get room service, we had to order it from my SS and DIL room next door as the tablet in our room didnt work .... 40 minutes later we chased food ... kitchen didnt answer phone .. reception said food had stopped for the night ... SS went out and at 2am saw someone getting a pizza from kitchen !!??? then we were told we could only get crisps ... 2x vodka and OJ £24 !! 
the room was freezing even when i had turned AC off .. i thought bed ws too hard but get thats my preference. got woken upo several times in night from noise of other guests and also from what i can only asume was the engine ??
we didnt have breakfast (as i said over priced) I get having a nice wine on the deck and paying a preium but £5 for c*ap tea ?? 
This hotel could be an absolute gem if only the staff were aware of how to treat customers in a high quailty setting.
The £80 deposit was takenn from my account and will take 3-5 days to credit ! I am not happy with this and unfortuantly not staff here or recommend you stay here. there is a hotel next door called Good Hotel that looked lovely and we had a drink on the roof top bar with friendly helpful staff ... i would give there a try instead.",2,2019,07,02
119,PLEASE DON'T WASTE YOUR MONEY!,"Me and my husband £570 to stay here for 2 nights on wednesday 26th june for our 1st yrs wedding anniversary, upon arrival we were told that we still had 5mins untill check in so we went to the bar, the barman told us to take a seat as it was table service, after waiting 15mins i decided to collect my drink myself only to be told they didnt have my husbands drink and we was to choose something else, overall it took about 30mins to be served even though there were only 6 people in the bar at the time.The drinke were ridiculously overpriced with an added service charge. When trying to check in AGAIN we were greeted by a miserable,rude young lady called Ilona who then informed us that as we didnt have the card we had booked and paid on (altough payment was made days prior and booking confirmed) we wasnt allowed to stay and there was nothing she can do! she needed that exact card! so if you have been bought this trip as a gift im assuming you will need to bring the payees card with you?? on booking this there was nothing to say that bringing that card was complusary. Luckly enough for us we only lived the other side of the water so was able to get a black taxi home to collect the card which cost us £50! cant imagine how anyone travelling from afar would be able to do or afford to do this. eventually 2hours later we eventually checked into our room, after walking down the hallway with the worn out rippled carpet that tripped me over our bathroom had hair all over the floor. The balcony with sea view that we paid extra for was tiny i could just about cross my legs without grazing my knees, with 2 cheap garden furniture chairs to sit on, and when u did u couldnt see the sea only the sky as the chairs were low down. Its so close to the city airport, at first watching a plane go past so close was amazing untill we realised it was every 5 mins and was so loud you had to stop conversation untill the plane had past, this was from morning untill late.EVERY 5 MINUTES!! The room was big but not luxury, the cleaner left our dirty coffee cups and spoons after making up our room and left our room with 1 tea bag. Breakfast was ok, nothing to write home about, cheap bacon, had plenty of breakfasts like this in alot cheaper accommodation, wasnt worth the upgrade! Toilets in bar and reception were clean but  the only time the sink water worked was when you turn on the bidet hose in the cubicle?? Some Staff were rude, some had very strong accents and were hard to understand, The only thing thats luxury about this Yacht is the stair case, it was beautiful,gives you the impression on arrival that you are stepping into a luxury, classy  hotel but the rest of this hotel is standard and feel we wasted our money. The website for Sunborn is terrible, only promoting the spa and wont allow you to do anything direct with them, i didnt get to use the spa as you have to book via reception who had no clue as to prices and info etc, i was told that reception would call them and the spa would call me back at somepoint, when they did i was told the therapist had been working and was tired and could only see me at 9am the morning i was leaving. When checking out i was asked how my stay was, i explained that i was far from happy and the duty manager refunded our breakfast cost and our overpriced bar bill for 2 drinks which we waited ages for and got something compleatly  different anyway which altogether came to £78...£50 of which wouldve covered our taxi bill home to collect our bank card, so to be honest wasnt much compensation for all the inconveniance we had! I wouldnt recommend this place to anyone unless you have money to burn and are not expecting to much in return.",3,2019,07,01
119,Visit Saturday 29th June 2019,"First approached the boat and it looked lovely. Only way to gain entrance to boat is via the lift, I have bad anxiety of enclosed spaces. I had to wait to be let in the fire exit.i think this should be explained on booking. On booking I was told my card would be held the amount 48 prior and payment could be made on the day. They took the payment in full instead 48 hours before, even though I explained at the time of booking I had a £200 gift voucher to use. I now have to wait 3-5 days for a refund back to my card. In the Bar we waited 25 minutes for chips, asked for mayo and was given empty used jars from another table by the waiter. Service in restaurant was poor, waited 20 minutes for them to take our dinner plates. Explained at check out when asked if we had a good stay, receptionist not interested. Bar and restaurant add 12.5% discretionary tip to everything. How they can justify that with such poor service is beyond me. Not worth the money at all.",2,2019,06,30
119,Something different in Docklands ,"Well........ before l went for our stay on the yacht  (which was a gift to us for my husband’s birthday) l decided to read the reviews of it on Trip Advisor!    I was quite apprehensive after reading some of the comments - but after our overnight stay feel like l was on a different yacht to some of these reviewers!  

Firstly, when we got to our “cabin” my breath was taken away by how big it was!    I have been on a few cruise ships that have cabins like egg boxes.   I had read about the twin beds put  together, the pillows were too soft,  surly staff etc etc.   From the moment we stepped into the reception area  we did not come across one “surly” member of staff.   In fact they could not have  done any more to make our stay more comfortable.   Only one downside - the drinks and food are quite expensive but the food was very delicious and the service was excellent!   

Recommended if you fancy something different for your stay in London.  💖",5,2019,06,30
119,.... left a bitter taste!,"After booking this hotel for my Parents for a Christmas present, and for an engagement gift for my sister, we decided to go and stay ourselves after recently having a baby. I tried to book direct on the sunborn website however a box kept coming up for me to enter a draw for a spa break (sunborn promotion not a random advert) despite continually clicking continue browsing it kept coming up. I decided to then book via Expedia. Later on that evening I looked at the hotel for things to do on my iPad (the contine browsing worked this time) and I noticed you get benefits for booking direct, such as 10% of food bill, and upgrades if available. I emailed sunborn and advised I booked via Expedia (it was £3 cheaper despite sunborn promoting they offer the cheapest rates). I explained my issue, and that this was a treat & asked whether they could honour the loyalties or would I need to cancel and rebook. The response back, “no we are unable to honour this & as you booked a non refundable rate with Expedia you won’t be able to cancel”. I found this so frustrating as we were going to eat onboard, but knowing I could’ve saved left a bitter taste in our mouths! I mean I only saved £3 by booking elsewhere & did contact immediately to explain! I have spent over £700 with sunborn this year! The hotel is lovely & the staff are very friendly but due to the poor service on my booking this will be the last time.",2,2019,06,28
119,Well below standards,"
We stayed in a family room from Monday 3rd and checked out this morning. We upgraded the room and I am very sorry we did this. I am wholly disappointed in the whole stay.

When we checked in we were given zero information about the services the hotel has to offer such as times, restaurant information, facilities and spa etc etc. I would expect this on check-in but I had to ask about everything. We subsequently went to our room which was room 2016. The room was spacious but disappointingly there was no bath. I feel this should be mentioned in the hotel description as it would definitely have been a deciding factor for me in booking. I dispute the description that premium bedding was provided as it is possibly one of the most uncomfortable stays I have ever had. If we weren’t so shattered I would have complained earlier. 

The room two doors down was clearly smoking cannabis from their balcony and I could clearly see a bong being used. There was also a lot of noise and banging throughout our stay. As I have a small child in our party this was highly intimidating and I generally felt that for a four star the whole experience was daunting, disappointing and I did not feel safe and I also found the emergency exit signage was confusing. 

I did contact the hotel but received no response.

119,Annivesary Weekend,"Great location and great service, felt really well taken care of by Salomey for afternoon tea. Food was more than ample for us and we were asked if we wanted more! We also used the spa(I am sorry I didnt take your names) myself and ,my wife were very satisfied with our massage. If you want to try something different in London don't hesitate!",4,2019,06,24
119,Terrible,From the moment of booking I had a terrible experience! The 25 minutes to wait for my calls to be answered. This happened 3 times so it’s standard. The extremely rude staff. One person could t find my booking so would t deal with me! The fact I booked via my company and then had to show company card details and ID or I couldn’t stay. Ridiculous policy. I’ve stayed in hundreds of places via work and have never had this treatment. I’ll never stay again ever. I had a £400 room booked. The executive suite. Absolutely terrible waste of money. Avoid avoid avoid! Stay in a travel lodge or the pavement! It would be a better experience!!!,1,2019,06,22
119,Pleasantly Surprised!,"I didn't quite know what to expect as I had never heard of a ""Yacht Hotel"" before, but I was very pleasantly surprised.
The size of our classic room was unexpectedly generous. The queen sized bed was very comfortable and the nautically themed decor was aesthetically tasteful. As our room was below deck, the only reminder of being on water once actually on board was looking at the river view from the restaurant. The staff were helpful to the nth degree and nothing was too much trouble.
The breakfast was absolutely delicious and you could eat your fill.
My only bugging issue was the key card that is also supposed to operate the lift. It was very temperamental; in the 2/3 days we were there we had to get it re-programmed 3 times this was somewhat inconvenient. Other than that we enjoyed our stay very much. We'd like to try Sunborn, Gibraltar next!",4,2019,06,21
119,Disappointed ,"Was really looking forward to staying here as we normally stay at the Novatel opposite, staff were very unfriendly, one if the rooms had been cancelled as they had tried to take the money for the room the day before even though we had chosen the ‘pay at property ‘ option, the lady seemed to have great delight in telling our friends there cars had declined in full earshot of other guests making them feel awkward. 
The rest of the stay did not get much better, the rooms were clean but the double bed had two single mattresses on it so there was a line/hole down the middle of the bed, bar staff looked like they had lost a £10 and found a pound, over all a very disappointing experience, will not return and continue to stay at the novatel from now on. 
",1,2019,06,20
119,Unique experience,"Stayed here with my son after a day at Comic Con and was not disappointed, Rooms big, clean and comfy. would recommend this as something different to your usual hotel stay. Staff very friendly and courteous.",5,2019,06,19
119,From the deck of superyacht hotel,"It’s the time to see different side of the most exciting city of the world from the deck of a luxurious superyacht hotel.

Set on a luxury yacht moored in the Docklands, this upscale hotel is adjacent to the ExCel London convention centre and a 5-minute walk from Docklands Light Rail trains to central London.

",5,2019,06,17
119,Birthday Visit,"We stayed here for two nights as an alternative to central London. The yacht itself is beautiful and clean. The check in staff weren’t overly friendly, the woman serving us was spending more time with her trainee than acknowledging and speaking to us. The room was a good size but was not prepared for three adults as we had booked, we had to return to reception to ask for the pull out bed to be made up and for more towels. The pull out bed was incredibly uncomfortable. The air conditioning in the room did not work very well and it was very hot in the room. We did enjoy our stay but a few things could be improved.",4,2019,06,16
119,What a treat,Fantastic night aboard this beauty with great views across the Thames. Breakfast excellent. We traveled with a local coach company Vision Tours. The cabins were very spacious even bigger than a lot of Hotel rooms.,5,2019,06,16
119,Overnight stay,"I did a one night stay at the hotel in a classic dock view room - the room was surprisingly big and had everything I needed from ironing board to tea/coffee making facilities. I didn’t go for the breakfast which was 19.50 per head - but reading the reviews, I don’t think I missed out on much. I would come back and stay here if I needed to be in the area again. ",4,2019,06,15
119,Absolutely nothing to complain about,"Some months back I booked this hotel as a birthday treat for myself. I read the reviews before booking & they were mostly positive, but the closer to our stay there were a few more negative ones & I did begin to wonder whether I would be disappointed. I needn't have worried, I can honestly say we had a fabulous stay & did not have any of the problems others have posted about, such as noise & poor customer service. 
Check in was quick & simple, the young woman on reception was very welcoming & efficient, in fact every member of staff we encountered was friendly & helpful.
We stayed in an Executive King Room with river view. The room was spacious & spotlessly clean, with a small balcony, sadly we didn't get to use the balcony as much as I would have liked because of the awful weather but the main thing the room was so quiet & peaceful.
We did not eat breakfast on the boat, as I felt £20 a head was rather a lot in view of the fact I need gluten free food & probably would not be able to eat much of what was on offer. We did however eat dinner on board on the night of my birthday, my husband checked with the restaurant with regard to my need for gluten free food and the staff could not have been more helpful. We had a wonderful meal which we both thoroughly enjoyed and fantastic service from our lovely waitress Neringa. Thank you, you made my birthday meal memorable.
So all in all we loved our stay at this hotel, we have recommended it to friends, who have already booked for August and we hope to return in the not too distant future ourselves.",5,2019,06,15
119,Disappointed by Customer Service,"Why do hotels like this think they have the right to make up pathetic excuses as to why something happened when you make a complaint?
I made a complaint yesterday morning as to why the reception staff let several people queue jump in front of me. 
Apparently the reason is that they have no control over queue jumping and the unwelcoming reception staff are happy to let that happen. So if you are going there just go straight to the reception desk by passing anyone that appears to be queueing
My compensation for my inconvenience was a late check out but I was told by email at 10:30. That was the time I left the room. Nobody could be bothered to phone me in my room the evening before. 
Secondly my advice is not to have breakfast there. Everything is bland and if you like several cups of tea or coffee you will be up and down as you can only get single cups. 
Better to go to Starbucks near the station if you want decent coffee. 
I go this hotel several times a year but the customer service and cutbacks are getting worse. The rooms are great but a hotel can’t be judged on the rooms alone.",2,2019,06,14
119,Love this place!,Repeat visit for an annual conference at Excel. Quite expensive bar (£9 for a Peroni) but fantastic views (see pic). I'll be back. The dockside views are worth the extra few pounds (if you get a balcony room),4,2019,06,09
119,A little bit different.,"An opportunity to try something a little different. The public areas of the boat are very attractive. The room was well appointed, clean and spacious and benefitted from a balcony where it was possible to sit.  Shower room small but has everything you need. Very comfortable bed and quiet despite aircraft taking off from or landing at nearby London City Airport. Located next to the Excel and about a 5 minute walk from DLR where it takes about 30 mins to reach central London. Ideal if you like the contrast of being able to get away from frenetic central London to somewhere a bit more relaxed. ",4,2019,06,09
119,Very average,"Slow check in.  Staff had an attitude and were unhelpful.

Rooms are dated and very basic, comparable with a dated premier inn.  Pillows were lumpy.  Everything was cheap cheap cheap.  Also be careful with the classic rooms on floors 1 and 2 as these have small windows, are dark and dingy.

Room service was fast and good quality.",3,2019,06,09
119,Great cabin/ view and value,"Great location for excel conference and for O2. River views give you amazing views of Canary Wharf and planes taking off from city airport - noise wasn’t an issue though. 

Didn’t try the rather overpriced breakfast and eat elsewhere but the room itself offered great ‘cruise’ style accommodation. Decor a little dated but clean and in good condition.  Would stay again - better that an identikit hotel room for same value. ",4,2019,06,08
119,Lovely weekend,"Lovely weekend, good location, easy to travel to the O2, room was beautiful, staff hit and miss, expensive but worth a little treat.   Didn't eat in the restaurant but lots of lovely restaurants nearby (especially the Thai).  ",4,2019,06,05
119,Perfect Location,"My wife and I recently stayed at the Sunborn Yacht Hotel whilst seeing a show at the O2. It was a five minute walk to the Emirates Air Line straight to the arena.

The hotel was clean and neat with attentive staff on arrival.

We had the afternoon tea and were served by Salomey who made the experience all the more perfect. I cant praise her enough for the way she made us feel so welcome and relaxed. The food was amazing, especially the scones and it was a struggle to walk after I have to admit, because we ate so much.

We will definitely stay there again and recommend it to anyone.",5,2019,06,05
119,What a Yacht!,"Stayed here for one night whilst watching a show at the O2. Great location and easy access to the Emirates cable cars (note cable cars stop at 10pm so you have to use tube and dlr to get back if after 10pm). Room very spacious particularly for London, amenities very good and check in easy. They take a £40 deposit on your card which is a bit of a cheek but you get it back if you do not use it. Views from the deck area are excellent.",4,2019,06,04
119,Restaurant at Sunborn Hotel,"I had a really nice dinner tonight with a excelent service from the Waiter Binoy. He know how the quest  should be taken care of and he could’t do it good enough. I love it.
It’s another kind of hotel.",5,2019,06,02
119,Quirky but not all top notch!,"Location is pretty good especially if you want Ex Cel. Our room was good although no Sky T.V. It had a balcony and a very good shower - but no bath which upset my wife. Had lunch in the bar area - this was very nice - and we were well served by the friendly bar staff. Dinner was not such a great experience - mainly because I think they were understaffed. The starter was tasty - a ham terrine - but it was advertised with sour dough and that wasn't on the plate when they brought it. It was impossible to catch a server and when I eventually got a senior staff member they offered to send it out - but I had finished. The mains - rib eye - was O.K. but the jus had a very funny taste. The restaurant did, however, offer very acceptable wine by the glass. So a mixed bag. I enjoyed my stay but see no reason to repeat it .",3,2019,05,31
119,Amazing visit - thank you Gabrielle and Nahed,"One of the best hotels we have ever stayed in. Nahed did everything he could to get us the most beautiful room and was one of the most helpful and lovely people we have ever met 

Gabrielle was really helpful too! She was very smiley and helped us with what to do and where to go in London - a really lovely lady 

Akash also helped with the recommendations! 

We would 1000% recommend this hotel! Thank you Nahed and Gabrielle for making our anniversary celebrations so special and memorable. A credit to the hotel",5,2019,05,25
119,A beautiful ship but not quite what I expected.,"My daughter and I treated ourselves to a night in this beautiful yacht hotel. The decor is stunning, the rooms are beautiful. We had ordered a family room which had a king size bed and a sofa bed. I am quite slight and slept on the sofa bed. Sadly this was one of the most uncomfortable and sleepless nights I have had. Staff put up the bed but one of the legs started to collapse in the middle of the night! 

Sadly we were unable to use the bar as a massive party of hundreds was in progress. There was a makeshift bar for residents but party goers spread there too. I would however like to thank and praise the staff who were having to cope with all these somewhat rowdy drunk people. They were remarkable despite being under great stress. Well done! 

I suppose it was just bad luck that we had chosen this one night to treat ourselves, but I will not be going back as very disappointed.   ",2,2019,05,25
119,Staff were wonderful,"The place is absolutely stunning. Came with my mum for afternoon tea and a spa treatment and both were amazing. The staff were lovely; very friendly and accomadating. Highly recommend coming here for an afternoon, will be back next time to stay the night.",5,2019,05,24
119,Amazing Afternoon Tea,My family visited the Sunborn London for the first time for afternoon tea and we were greeted by the delightful Salomey who was informative about the menu. She and her colleague Alisha  made our experience there memorable and ensured to include our little toddler in the afternoon delight. Not forgetting the chef themselves who provided us with consistency in the production of the unforgettable scones and miniature desserts. The whole experience exceeded our expectation that we will definitely being returning sooner with more family members. Thank again to the team it was joy!,5,2019,05,23
119,What a shame... Not what it was. Very disappointed since last stay.,"2 rooms, one for me, another for my business partner, stayed for 5 nights.

The Good... Two of the bar staff were great, Akkash and another chap (can't remember his name, on the same shift). Engaging, efficient and looked like they enjoyed working there. Breakfast on one of the mornings was good. Housekeeping were friendly & unobtrusive. Reception staff greeted with a smile.
The Bad... The rest of the bar staff looked like they HATED being there. Getting a drink was a chore, frustrating & expensive. I kind of expect more than a miserable reluctance to be served, or even for asking for the bill. OMG the breakfast is not a great experience either... who cooks sausages on ONE side only, pink in the middle? Butter only on selected tables, plates whisked away immediately after your last bite, the worst toaster ever... and did I mention the half cooked sausages? 
The Ugly... Why oh why did they remove the luxury champagne coloured carpet in the rooms? It was literally LOVELY and a major selling point. My room had an industrial blue coloured carpet for some reason, my business partner described his room as ""lino & laminate""! 

With rooms, food and bar tab, our stay cost us about £2.6k. Massively disappointed. Not value for money. There are other places nearby that are cheaper and better.",3,2019,05,19
119,50th Birthday ,"Staying in the yacht as this review goes out... staying here for a birthday celebration. Boat itself is nice and generally staff courteous, we are in a room towards the front of the boat which is as expected except for the intermittent loud noise that goes on and off.. went to reception who really were not that interested in the cause or trying to resolve sadly not what you would expect from a hotel at this price point. Perhaps the second night will be different, disappointing as a birthday celebration falling flat.",3,2019,05,17
119,Afternoon tea,"Went for an afternoon tea which was very good, lots of scruffy food and endless cups of tea. Situated near The EXCEL centre London so not the easiest place to get to. However well worth the effort. The surrounding area somewhat spoils the experience but would certainly recommend it as somewhere to have a lovely experience.",4,2019,05,16
119,the sunborn,great hotel great staff the cabin was brill with coffee maker and free wfi but be careful I ordered a larger and a vodka and coke and it cost me £19 .60 that way to much but saying that the breakfasts were great ,4,2019,05,14
119,"Good sized, comfy room",I had one of the most basic rooms and it was very spacious and comfortable. It was dock facing and level 1 but still was above the water line. Breakfast wasn't included so can't comment on the food. Staff were friendly at check-in and out.,4,2019,05,09
119,Disappointing Visit,"Just returned from our fourth visit to the Sunborn Yacht and although the rooms are fine, clean and roomy ad always, what has happened to the breakfast? Limited choice of cereals, the cooked breakfast was at best lukewarm the fried eggs were rubbery resembling ones you used to be able to buy from a joke shop! I can't imaging how long the whole thing had been in the so called warmers to be in the state they were.We arrived at breakfast at 8am so perhaps they were cooked at 6.30am when breakfast were first served. Not only was the food terrible, since we last visited they have stopped serving fresh tea and coffee, you now have to collect your own from an urn, which by the taste of the tea bad been standing as long as the breakfast...stewed tea and tepid food, not good enough.
At the price you pay for a nights stay I expect far more than this. Will we be visiting again I am not sure, there are far cheaper places near by who would do far better, perhaps the Sunborn Yacht have become very complacent?",2,2019,05,07
119,2 day visit to ExCEL Grand Designs with overnight stay on the Sunborn Yacht,Absolutely fabulous night on the yacht! We were staying over for the Grand Design Exhibition and the yacht is perfectly placed right next to ExCEL. The rooms are amazing and everyone is really friendly and helpful.  I've stayed there quite a few times and would definitely recommend it.,5,2019,05,07
119,Very relaxed,"Lovely place to stay, felt like we were on holiday. We would definitely stay again for the price. Took the cable car over to the O2 for lunch at Gaucho. Room was lovely but the bed was a little firm bordering on hard for me. There is a great tapas place just a few minutes walk away. ",4,2019,05,07
119,60th birthdfay present for my husband,"Overall it was an excellent stay. Room was lovely with a balcony and good views. Bed was very comfortsble. We ate out as prices were better, very expensive to eat on the boat. Warning for all if you have drinks in the bar as they add a service charge for drinks brought to the table. We had no warning when we went to the bar. The bar maid told my husband to sit down and when we were leaving we were presented with a bill of £28.13 for 2 gin and tonics with a service charge. They only sell doubles which we were not aware of. I let the management know and received an apoloigy as I felt we were conned. Other guests appeared to be aware of this charge and insisted on buying drinks at the bar. All in all a lovely treat. Breakfast is buffet style.",5,2019,05,07
119,"Excellent Hotel, No Faults","Stayed beginning of May. Checked in early to leave luggage, staff very friendly whenever we needed them. Whole hotel was spotless. Room was enormous, king size bed, huge mirrors around the room. Plenty of storage space.
Excellent location as we were spending the day and night at the o2 arena.
Couldn't find one fault with this hotel. Definitely recommend to friends and will stay again if in this area of London. ",5,2019,05,07
119,Afternoon Tea,"We booked afternoon tea here on a Saturday afternoon and had a lovely day!
The drinks and then the tea took a little while to arrive but I suspect that's because they make them to order given that we made some slight changes to what we wanted.  The hot chocolates were lovely as they were a cup of hot milk with a large chocolate stirrer.  I've not had one of those anywhere other than at home before and it was delicious.
The sandwiches were lovely, the scones were still warm and the cakes were perfect and all very fresh.  We ordered extra sandwiches because we were all so hungry!
When the waitress was pouring our prosecco she was chatting and asked us why we were there.  Said we were celebrating a belated birthday and then the conversation moved on.
At the end of the tea, she surprised us by bringing a large piece of delicious sticky toffee pudding with happy birthday written into a decorative chocolate. I was so impressed with this as she had just picked up on the birthday comment and done it off her own back.  I think that extra touch really showed a flair for customer service and passion for her job plus a company that allows their staff to make decisions and I always admire that.
We then moved into the bar area and spent another 4 hours drinking cocktails.
Our experience was ruined slightly by an unreasonable family sitting next to us who were having issues checking in and were arguing loudly with the manager.  They were making self-important statements about how much power they had at work and how much business they would move from the hotel and saying things such as 'I work in the hospitality industry'...generally just being a pain and also swearing which was unpleasant.  The management team seemed to deal with them very well and  resolved the situation.
We ended up spending around 6 hours in total and all felt well looked after and relaxed.  I wouldn't hesitate to return!",5,2019,05,05
119,Lovely stay,"Room clean and spacious, lovely breakfast. Unfortunately let down slightly due to double bed being made by two single beds pushed together and only held together with a sheet, so there was a dip!!! Would stay again though",4,2019,05,05
119,Birthday treat,We Stayed for 3 nights in an executive room I cannot fault our trip the staff were amazing and the room was lovely the most comfortable bed I've ever slept in we enjoyed drinking cocktails in the sundown bar with an amazing view we will definitely be back,5,2019,05,03
119,Suited for corporate types.,Stayed here with wife and relatives and although the venue is very impressive it seems that they are more geared to entertaining the corporate clientele. Only really had access to the bar and front deck as there was a corporate event on the upper deck so this was out of bounds??? Given that a room is not cheap you would think that the staff would be very accommodating but sadly not. Everything seem to be a chore. ,3,2019,05,02
119,Afternoon tea on the Sunborn ,"Well, we love the experience. We enjoyed a selection of sandwiches, cakes and scones and if we didn’t like some of them, we could have more of the ones we did like. The service was great and not over powering, the environment was top draw and would recommend afternoon tea for anyone wanting to experience the location. 
 ",5,2019,04,28
119,"Celebration of 70th Birthday, and visit to Theatre (Royal Haymarket)","Absolutely excellent caring, polite and efficient attention from every member of the Sunborn' staff. We enjoyed yet another couple of nights, and will return, again, soon, this year. Lovely [river side] room and facilities.",5,2019,04,28
119,Amazing property ,"Hotel was way better  then I expected. Property  is amazing and very unique. Easy to reach with metro and with river bus you can go to central  London. Very clean room and comfortable. 
Check in was very fast. Bar drinks ok bit overpriced. No  room service  after restaurant  is closed. Overall  we enjoyed  and would like to come back. ",5,2019,04,26
119,The worst hotel ever,"The charge alot and looks good but its just a shell. You walk in and there is a strong cleaning smell to hide. The key in the elevator never works.
Cold rooms with only 19 degrees. The staff threw away a plastic bag of mine. The staff is not as nice as they seem. There is not one healthy thing on the breakfast table. Never stayed in a more none priceworthy hotel. Warning!!!!",1,2019,04,24
119,"Great setting, great staff, food okay","We visited the Sunborn to celebrate a birthday. A couple of our party were staying on the boat and we were all very impressed by the hotel room.
The meal was okay but very expensive for what it was. We ordered from the set menu. The bread given wasn't great and a bit tough. We ordered fish goujons and chips for the children's meal (which cost £10 each) it was nothing more than what you would order in a cafe for £5. It's worth noting that some things on the set menu have an extra charge e.g. Bacon on the burger (£2) and blue cheese on the burger (£2).
The 3 courses were pretty good although some meals were tastier than others. 
The waitress for the meal was fantastic. She was very attentive and friendly and helped make our evening special. 
We had a lovely evening but the food didn't quite meet expectations. 

",4,2019,04,20
119,different,"overall I had a nice stay at the sunburn. it was expensive (£200 per night) for the area and time of year but there was a big event at the excel so all prices seem to rocket. 
it is right next door to the excel centre so very convenient and therefore very close to the DLR station and a few minutes walk from the cable car taking you to the O2
staff were friendly and welcoming. I found room was spacious and very clean. 
however, the internet connection was poor and the TV was not working ie it was so fuzzy I could not watch it",3,2019,04,20
119,Overpriced novelty with attitude ,"Stayed here on a trip taking my sister to a concert at the o2. While the location was exactly what we needed, unfortunately this is where the niceties ended. Upon arriving your greeted with the charming ""everything's an inconvenience"" attitude of the reception staff. You head down to your room where you can enjoy your tired looking furnace of a hotel room (I set the ""aircon"" to 10... yes 10 degrees and the room temperature after 6 hours of being on had risen to 27 degrees). 

The hotel is a novelty and sadly that's all it really is. This is the 3rd time I've stayed here and the will definitely be the last. Each time I've been greeted by the same unwelcoming staff, overpriced room and bar rates and bog standard hotel rooms. The tablet in the room is frozen so you cant use it. What a waste of £170! Stay away from this hotel, you'll find a more comfortable stay for a fraction of the price down the road at a travelodge.",1,2019,04,19
119,Great cabin but food and drink expensive ,"Stayed last night with my husband in the Sunborn Yacht hotel. I paid £99 for a classic cabin on level 1. The cabin was very spacious and very comfortable. There was a large oval window which thankfully wasn’t below the waterline! The superking sized bed was excellent though I wasn’t keen on the pillows. There was a large sofa with a coffee table, a kettle and a coffee machine. There’s also a fridge and a tv. The shower room was good and despite the hotel being on the approach to city airport, our cabin was very quiet. Unfortunately there was only 1 set of towels in the bathroom- we didn’t find the second set in the wardrobe until checkout!
It’s the only place I haven’t had anything to eat and drink. In my opinion the bar and restaurant were way overpriced. However there are several nearby restaurants and bars as an alternative. So I’m afraid I can’t comment on the standard of catering- very unusual for me! 
Would I recommend- actually yes, though it’s a little out of the way. 
Would I return- at a similar price, yes though probably wouldn’t be tempted by the food/ bar prices unless I knew for a fact that it was excellent.",4,2019,04,18
119,Something different and great value,"Stayed here as a surprise for a 50th birthday and its very impressive.
The staff were all great, always helpful whether it was on the telephone, in reception or the bar. A lovely little treat of chocolates for the birthday girl was a nice touch.
From the first steps to the rooms and everywhere inbetween was very clean and tidy and it looks extremely grand.
Our rooms, classic river view, were large and comfortable.
The nearest DLR station is custom house and you need to follow signs to the Excel centre rather than ""way out"".
The only negative is the rather over the top prices in the bar for spirits, £9 a shot, mixer on top as well, is more than a little steep and uneccesary.
Overall we loved our stay though and will definitely be back.",5,2019,04,18
119,Super hotel,"Stayed here for two nights and had a very comfortable stay. I had a top floor room over looking the quay. Spacious room with a balcony. King size bed and all amenities in room; tea and coffee etc, large tv. Room very clean and super bathroom with power shower and under floor heating which was great as weather wasn't very warm. My only issue was that it was very difficult to heat the room; the radiator only went up to 3 so was only just warm and the air conditioning didn't seem to work particularly well.   
Staff very helpful and friendly.",4,2019,04,13
119,Beautiful Hotel but expensive bar,"Stayed here for One night. The hotel I thought was lovely. Really comfty bed, very clean, staff all working really hard.
We got a really good price on room so was surprised how nice it was.
We had a private bar for a party and the bar bill nearly gave me a heart attack. Probably the most expensive drinks in hotels I have stayed in.
Only 1 of the 2 lifts were working and the one that was, was really slow due to the amount of people sing it.
Breakfast was really nice too.",4,2019,04,10
119,Interesting stay but looking it’s age,We had an ok time here for a two night stay in London. The bed was comfy but the boat is starting to feel it’s age. Clean and tidy but quite far out unless you are visiting the Excel. The staff are friendly enough and the bar area is ok but I’m not sure why they charge a 12.5% service charge to deliver your drink some 25 feet. ,3,2019,04,08
119,Spa and afternoon tea,"Took my daughter for her birthday and had a fabulous time! We had two treatments each with two lovely ladies who pampered and preened us with some gorgeous products! They were very professional, friendly, and knowledgeable. Best massage I've ever had!! We absolutely loved it!!
The afternoon tea was delicious, and the champagne top quality! Service was first class all round. My daughter was thrilled with the day. We will definitely go back!",5,2019,04,08
119,Enjoyable stay,"We stayed for 2 nights and overall had a unique and enjoyable experience. Staff were very pleasant and helpful, room was large and clean. Great views of Canary Wharf, especially from bar on a night. Food in Bar was great, snacks etc.  Only downside was our trip coincided with a large group of loud undesirable people who had loud brash cars which they enjoyed revving. Luckily this event only happens once a year. This hotel is far too good to accommodate this type of clientele!! Would recommend for something a bit different in London.",4,2019,04,07
119,It’s a boat -  it has beds nothing special,"For the price of the room (£240) I was expecting more.
The room is ok but too warm unless I had door to balcony open. Bed is comfortable enough 
WiFi in room poor (for the cost I expected better). The bar was characterless and La barrique wine bar (5 mins away) is better
Buffet breakfast serving yourself for everything and no real interaction with staff - again for the way this promotes itself I expected more.
Its only real selling point is proximity to Xcel 
But much the same as the ibis next door.
Overall under-whelming and overpriced with little character or welcome

119,Pretty cool hotel,"First time staying on a boat!
Room was decent, larger than typical hotel rooms in London. Breakfast was sufficient.
Toilet was smaller than expected, but considering that this is a boat.... The room I was in had a mini balcony/deck with seats. Got to enjoy a cup of coffee every morning on the deck and see the sun go up.
Hotel had a couple of supermarkets in the vicinity, and is right beside ExCeL. If you're there for an exhibition, would recommend!!",5,2019,04,04
119,WENT IN FOR A DRINK,i was staying at another place but went in for a few drinks lovely décor and a fantastic looking hotel the staff were friendly very close to the excel i will in the future book to stay here on what i have seen and heard,4,2019,04,03
119,Took mum out for early mothersday,"Very Nice food, free entree, cocktails overpriced! Not so good service around 10x staff who all avoided eye contact never had our water delivered to our table then was charged for a bottle, we had a coupon for 3x course meal and free rossini cocktail we had 4x coupons for some UNKNOWN reason we could not change the cocktails even though all cocktails was same value! Probably 3hrs in total between getting there and leaving. Would we come back probably not. ",4,2019,04,01
119,Party ,"Had a family party yesterday (Sunday),

Staff were great and friendly service.

Food was lovely, nice and no rush.

Room was good and clean, transportation if you need to get back into London is straight forward, dlr station very close.

Thanks to all staff involved.

119,Good hotel close to excel,I spent here one night during to the Skytrax awards. It’s a simple and nice atmosphere. Rooms are quite spacious but the bathrooms are a bit more “lower standard”than expected. I had a balcony room so I can have some fresh air but my colleagues had some issues with the ventilation. They have an amazing terrace overviewing The City. Breakfast was nice  but nothing groundbreaking. ,4,2019,03,31
119,"Great afternoon tea, not so great spa","I booked the spa and afternoon tea through one of the discount websites. To be honest   I didn't check trip advisor which is unlike me, so coming closer to our booking I was really nervous. The spa treatment was a back massage and facial. It wasn't the worst but it certainly wasn't the best.  The treatment rooms were clean and well presented.  However,  there was no sink so the therapist had to leave the room to wash her hands. The room had windows and even though the blinds were closed, it was still quite bright.  The walls were very thin so conversations in the next room could be overheard.  The massage and facial were ok. I asked for very firm but felt too much pressure was applied to my bones which is still painful.  My daughter had the opposite experience and said her treatment was fine.

The afternoon tea was booked for just after our treatment. However when we got to reception we were advised that the restaurant didn't open until 12.30.  Reception contacted the restaurant manager who came up and apologised that they had not received the email with the booking. However as the restaurant was not open, we could have a drink on the house until the restaurant opened. As soon as the restaurant was open we were promptly collected and seated. We were offered a choice of hot drinks and given the menu. We were served  by Salomey. Neither of us eat red meat or cheese so the sandwich selection was limited as the only thing we would eat was the salmon. Despite this Salomey said she would check with the chef whether they had chicken or turkey. She returned with chicken and salmon sandwiches. They were to die for. The afternoon tea included mini scones, bakewell tarts, brownies,  pannacotta and macaroons. Everything tasted great and was one of the best afternoon teas I've had. The tea was freshly brewed leaves  hot and plenty of substance, not the weak watered down rubbish that seems to served in most places. Champagne was also part of the deal but as we didn't have it, Salomey spoke to the restaurant manager and asked if our bottled waters that were not included in the voucher could be substituted. She was a great waitress, friendly, helpful and couldn't do enough for us. Thanks to both her and the restaurant manager for making what would have been a disappointing experience more than positive. The hotel is in a great location, is attractive and the staff we came in contact with were all pleasant. I would definitely go back and would also love the opportunity for an overnight stay.",4,2019,03,30
119,When sorry is said so many times it has no meaning,"I booked 3 rooms for 4 nights for a business trip.  The cabins are pleasant although a little dated, the beds are comfortable and it’s lovely staying riverside to open up onto the deck with great views.  Reception staff are very pleasant, however the services levels with the restaurant and bar fall well below expectations and staff adopt a couldn’t care less attitude.  The restaurant can’t accept more than 10 covers at any one time due to the size of the kitchen.  I saw numerous residents turned away because of this reason.  What type of hotel cannot offer reasonable restaurant facilities for its guests?  Breakfast costs £20 for full and £15 for continental.  Completely overpriced for self service with limited breakfast items.  There is more fruit choice in my supermarket lunch box than what the hotel offered.  Also, only 1 x 4 slice toaster available at breakfast time with constant queues.  Various residents complaining it was unacceptable.  After eating elsewhere one evening we returned to the hotel bar to be told it was closed - even to residents!  Staff constantly apologising for the shortfalls.  I was hoping for a great experience, but it was a disappointment.",2,2019,03,27
119,Great location and stylish but poor service in bar and restaurant,"Stayed for 4 nights. Location was great being only 3 minutes walk from the Excel Exhibition centre. The rooms are large with a sofa and a good bathroom. My room had a balcony which was a bonus.
The service was terrible for a luxury hotel. Check in was a long painful experience, getting a drink in the very expensive bar was painful and it took 3 hours for a 2 course meal in the restaurant. The food was good but not worth the prices charged.",3,2019,03,24
119,Ok....,"Me and my friends had afternoon tea here a few days ago. 
It was a bit disappointing to find that afternoon tea had gone up £5 each since our booking made in January. Nobody got in touch to advise of this. £25 service charge was also added to the bill, which was wavered for us in light of the above mentioned situation.
Afternoon tea was ok, to be honest ive had better for half the price.
The yaught is lovely, and definitely a nice experience. But sadly i wouldnt return. Its very pricey for what it is. ",3,2019,03,22
119,Great Unique Hotel in London,"We used this hotel when we were going to an event at the o2 arena and were pleased with our entire stay. 

We drove to the hotel which was easier than expected and parked in the Excel car park which had plenty of space. It was around a 40 minute tube & DLR journey into central london but we utilised the Emirates Air Line for our event. 

The hotel staff are very helpful and friendly and assisted us with any queries. We stayed in a double room which had a balcony which overlooked the docklands which was a nice way to wake up and go to sleep at night. The room itself had a few 'snags' which are probably wear or tear and to be expected although we felt it didn't quite match the standards of the main areas. The bed was incredibly large (bigger than a double) and super comfy. 

Breakfast was included in our package and we really enjoyed the views over the Canary Wharf whilst enjoying the food. A good selection of tea, coffee, juice, full english buffet, cereals and fruit were on offer and service was quick. We weren't sure we would have paid the £19.50 per head had it not been included though. 

We did have a drink in the bar in the evening and found the drinks to be good quality and priced to match London prices however, the bar snacks and food available seemed overly expensive. Sticky Toffee Pudding was £10. 

Overall we really enjoyed our stay and would stay again when attended events at the O2 or Excel.",4,2019,03,22
119,Best experience,"Fantastic place to start your stay in London, first class rooms exceptionally clean, staff were very friendly & helpful, from here we travelled to the 02 ,this was another must for us, we crossed the river Thames via the ski lift, seeing London at night well worth it,",5,2019,03,22
119,Something different for the weekend,"Good value from booking.com location is where we needed it to be. 
Unfortunately someone put drinks on my room bill but the staff sorted that out. They should always use both lifts for access there was some lengthy delays waiting to get on & off the boat. ",5,2019,03,21
119,Celebrating life,"What an incredible place set in the most magnificent surroundings of London 
Personable staff and delicious afternoon tea ,
I highly recommend the spa treatment!! It’s out of this world, warm welcome by the staff at reception and bar man was really helpful, more importantly one staff member stood out her name is Salomey. She engaged with all the guests and went above and beyond to make everyone feel special.

Thoroughly wow'd.
A return visit is a must.",5,2019,03,20
119,Sunborn London - Amazing,"We tried Sunborn for a different kind of hotel experience and we weren't disappointed. Our package included an executive double room, dinner for two and breakfast. The large room was fantastic with a polished wood finish to all the walls and furniture. It felt very grand. We had a small balcony with a view over the water to the far side of the dock. We found the room modern, stylish, very clean and equal to any 5 star hotel that we've stayed at previously. It was only the weather (poor) that prevented us from enjoying ourselves out on deck. The main stairway is quite elaborate and stunning and is clearly the central feature inside the yacht. Our dinner was excellent, with scallops followed by fillet steaks and cheese boards (1 each). All the food was fresh and cooked to perfection. The cheese boards had the biggest variety and largest pieces of cheese we've ever received on cheese boards - each board contained more than sufficient for two people. Breakfast was buffet style and once again offered a good variety of cooked, cereal and continental style food. We found service to be excellent and will be back again in warmer weather.",5,2019,03,20
119,Great alternative to your average hotel,Loved my stay here. Its a converted cruise-liner beautiful inside. Great views and the rooms are ridiculously large for the price. Great friendly staff. Great cocktails at the bar. The only things I could say that could be improved is getting onto the boat. There was only 1 lift and it takes A LONG time to just go a couple of floors. Also Its a shame the bottom deck facing inland you just see a wall and nothing more. Book a sea view if you can. Highly recommend this hotel though,5,2019,03,20
119,Birthday night disappointment,"Upon entering the hotel I was kind of underwhelmed at the decor.  The lifts were a pain as you had to put your card in the slot to enable the lifts to work and the card reader was playing up slightly, so time wasted playing around with the slot was irritating.  The cabin was how a cabin would be expected to look with wood furniture. The bed was UNCOMFORTABLE and the pillows were lacklustre, I'd say that the beds and pillows in a Premier Inn were much better. The bathroom needed updating in my opinion. 
We decided to go to the bar area behind reception which was the only place open for a drink as the bar terrace upstairs was closed. The bar area was kind of underwhelming. I fancied a coffee  and cake but was told that they only had a couple of muffins left over from breakfast so I had one of those. The coffee arrived and was luke warm.
We drank our drink and sat there feeling that the common areas could be updated somewhat.
Luckily we were going out to eat that night and managed to find an escape room nearby to do as couldn't have sat in the bar all evening.
Breakfast was again underwhelming not a very good selection and was luke warm.
Overall the whole experience left us leaving kind of deflated and seems like an effort to even write this review as the whole thing seemed very how would I say normal ! I think for this place to sell itself as an executive accommodation they need to seriously upgrade or have a look at the reviews written and think about their marketing.",3,2019,03,18
119,Perfect stay Amazing staff!,"I have stayed here at Sunborn London which is based in docklands I must say the service I have received from Loranas was outstanding with his customer skills brilliant guy, straight after we got handed the room keys lovely concierge named tados helped us with the luggage to our room. Once me and my wife got to our room we were amazed how well cleaned the room was and how large it was! We had couple of drinks in the bar the views were amazing! On check out staff were again amazing and couldn't thank them enough for everything. This has been most memorable stay and we would definitely be back to Sunborn!",5,2019,03,16
119,Wounderful Hotel in Graeat Area,"Refresh yourself and life from normal hotel . Create a new step. be relax and happy.
On Feb 27, 2019 I used room 565 5th floor. Really I don't know what to say. it's a wonderful a mazing hotel in a wonderful area. From door to door you feel relax and all helpful. very clean with a nice smell hotel. Room is beg enough. Food Delicious. Every thing amazing in this hotel. I will back a gain & again.",5,2019,03,16
119,It was ok,"We stayed here on Wednesday night. The room was lovely. The bed comfortable. We had a balcony but it was on the land side so not much use for it really. 
The floor heating in the bathroom made it unbearable to stay in for more than a few moments. We couldn’t figure out how to turn it off. The room got very warm in the night. No windows could open. Had the balcony door open but being on the docks there is a lot of noise even through the night. 
The staff on the front desk were polite and friendly. 
Breakfast was ok. Not much choice unless you like meat or bread for breakfast. I tried the scramble eggs but they tasted like fish. I was going to have yoghurt but there was just plain and no berries to add to it. 
Would have been nice to have something like an omelette or other cooked breakfast choices. 
Since my husband is fine with like the English style breakfast he didn’t mind it. 
All in all it was an ok stay. Just thought it would be better as it has a 4 star. Just a few little changes and it would have been great. ",3,2019,03,16
119,A quirky and enjoyable stay....,"We had a great mother/daughter experience here last night. The staff were beyond excellent. So many pleasant, helpful, smiley faces. A big plaudit to whoever is in charge of recruitment and training! It was so refreshing to meet house keeping who beam and say 'Good Morning' to you. Proud of what they're doing and rightly so. We all did these jobs when we were young. ( Guests don't forget to leave a tip!) 
The room/cabin on the bottom floor (1) was clean and spacious with a choppy view over to the O2 arena. Unfortunately it was too windy to be allowed out on deck but I bet it's stunning here in the summer!!!  We had dinner in the restaurant which was elegant with a matching view of the Thames. My vegan 16 yo daughter really struggled with the menu and ended up with chips and a green salad. Happily she'd eaten well in Covent Garden at lunchtime so it wasn't a big issue but maybe more attention needs to be paid in the future as not everyone likes mushrooms. The World is moving on and she also struggled at breakfast when there wasn't any Almond milk. Maybe there could be a booking question so the hotel could have sourced more appropriate food/milk. We didn't think, so it was probably our fault too! I had the market fish of the day which was Haddock and they were happy to exchange the chips for roasted vegetables but I was disappointed when it arrived covered in batter. Hasn't the UK moved on past this cliché? The other problem was only one lift was working (it happens) so we used the stairs. Also our key card kept getting wiped clean so we had to keep going back to reception. (Quite irritating the third time) Happily I'm a nice person and the cute black guy on reception thought it was amusing. (& no the card was nowhere near my phone!)  The breakfast was excellent. (Just had Almond milk). To sum up the staff here are professional, the service is excellent. The restaurant very romantic if you want to bring a lady here. I'm sure from the beautiful women I saw tonight in this restaurant, this would be an excellent venue to impress!",5,2019,03,11
119,SOMETHING DIFFERENT,"We stayed here for three nights.
Check in was made quick and easy by Joanna at reception, a very welcoming and informative girl.
The room was large, with all the usual amenities and nicely decorated.
The first night we ate in the Bar area and like other reviewers we found the service poor, having to wave at the waitress to get her attention.
Breakfast was ok except for the Coffee which was always cold, but the Tea was hot.
Breakfast was not included in our reservation, of which we were told every morning.
Every morning we said we would pay when we were finished eating.
The first morning was ok, the second morning they charged it to the room and, this I didn't like at all, on the third morning the waiter put the bill on the table even before we started eating.
On the second night we ate in the Bar area again, this time there were a couple of Managers on and the service was a lot better.
Check out was again made quick and easy by Vkazakevicius, who asked us about our stay and where we were from.
Would I stay here again, probably, but the staff in the Bar area would have to be more attentive to guests and the staff at Breakfast would have to be trained better in dealing with quests who are paying for breakfast.
I would have given five stars but for these two issues.",4,2019,03,11
119,wonderful location,"Wonderful and convenient location for business and for sightseeing. 
Confortable and cleen rooms 
Excellent service and facilities. Staff members well trained and very kind with the guests.
Good quality/price rate.",5,2019,03,11
119,Excellent,We were there for a conference. Couldn't fault anything. The room was very spacious and bathroom was spotless and modern. We had a lovely balcony with a great view of London.  The fold was lovely too. Draft super friendly couldn't do enough to assist,5,2019,03,10
119,They have a lot to fix ,"So £221 for a room. Expensive. You expect good service for that kind of money. 

The ship itself is a little outdated in terms of decor but nevertheless it’s nice. Comfy beds and a quiet enough sleep as no street noise. 

The issue is the bar area behind reception. It’s in total disarray. Staff arguing with each other and ignoring customers while they do. 

Staff walking around the bar area walking right past customers who have been sat waiting for their table service and then walking straight back to the bar! 

I went there for breakfast this morning and waited 7 minutes for anyone to even arrive at the bar so I asked at reception and she went to get someone. When she came she didn’t seem very happy but did apologise for my wait. 

Ordered coffee, tea, croissant and bacon sandwich .  Croissant took 20 mins and after 30 mins of no sign of my bacon sandwich asked the guy that was now behind the bar where it was. He asked the girl and she pulled a face and shouted its coming and walked off. It arrived another 5 minutes or so after.  

Last night I saw and heard many people making various complaints to the bar staff about food and service. I saw one young couple sat down and were not served for about 20 minutes and eventually he got up and went to the bar and got told “were coming”.  

As I type this I am Just listening at someone checking out with similar complaints (waited an hour for scrambled egg on toast in the bar) and they were sat there with me this morning but seems they also have other issues. 

Having stayed on the Sunborn in Gibraltar I expected the same (if not similar standard of service) but this place has a lot to learn. 

There seems to be no head of food and beverages front of house in the bar so no leadership and therefore bad service. 

Could do much much better. After some drinks and light breakfast with my daughter by total bill was £270 for one night. ",3,2019,03,10
119,Lovely stay on the Sunborn,"Stayed on Sunborn for 3 nights as we had an exhibition at Excel. The proximity to the exhibition was tremendous. Room was bigger than I expected on a ship, however bathrooms could do with an upgrade. Service was fine. Bar expensive.",4,2019,03,10
119,Family getaway....,Very good overall - Shower room was a bit tired and had an annoying step... The breakfast was of excellent quality and not rushed. The views of the city were a bonus on clear mornings...Easy access via DLR and Underground...,4,2019,03,06
119,Lovely stay on Sunborn,"Booked the Sunborn for a special birthday with my daughter and it was all I expected and more. We stayed in an executive room looking across the water. Very clean and plenty of space. Staff were friendly and check in and out was a breeze. When we arrived it was dark as we left the Docklands Light Railway and walked over the bridge to the boat, it was all lit up and very inviting. I would definitely stay again. ",5,2019,03,05
119,Anniversary celebration,"Stayed 3 March for one night
Room was lovely 
Apart from the bed which was hard and very uncomfortable even the pillows was rubbish 
Had lunch & champagne 
Very nice but expensive 
Dinner was very nice 
Breakfast was a disappointment self service 
Was cold 
No fresh coffee or tea all self service 
We booked with secret Escapes got quite a good deal 
but still expensive 
Wouldn’t say it’s was value for money
We still had a nice time 
Would we stay again 
Sorry I would have to say nom

119,CELIAC WARNING,"Stayed here on 1st March with the family having the evening meal. Two members of my family have Celiac both were given a gluten free option with there own bread. Both suffered from a reaction of some contamination and were seriously ill the next day. Warning to other guests who choose to eat here that they FAILED. Awaiting a call from the manager on Sunday, he also failed and never called.",1,2019,03,03
119,Stayed for 3 Nights - Nice and Different Experience,"I stayed here for 3 days (last week of Feb 2019). It was a different experience. I didn't stay much time in the room during day time. 
- Full Breakfast is charged 20 GBP and it was an average breakfast. 
- If you get rooms on First floor facing the road then you won't feel like living in Yacht
- Rooms are well maintained and similar to Yacht
- Two Bottles of Water (Complimentary everyday)
- Two Packets of Biscuits (Complimentary everyday)
- Try to get the Water side view (preferably - 2,3 or 4th floor)
- WiFi Signals are average
- Phone Signal was bad (1st floor)
- Don't forget to go on top Victoria Dock Bridge",3,2019,03,03
119,A wonderful place to stay,This yatch is amazing.  The location is peaceful.  There are lots of places to eat surrounding the hotel.    Inside it is decorated to such a high standard.  It definitely has a wow factor.  It is iddifuclt to find things to criticise here.  The staff are very good and nothing is too much trouble.  Definately a place to stay!,5,2019,03,03
119,Slow internet and crap A/C,"I yacht and room were nice but the internet wasn’t fast enough for FaceTime with my kids and the A/C was essentially useless as it couldn’t cool the room. The restaurant was pricy (20 pounds for buffet breakfast) but probably worth it. The hotel was conveniently close to the convention center, but there is nothing interesting nearby so I wish I had stayed downtown.",3,2019,03,02
119,50th Birthday surprise,"Came for a surprise for my husbands  50th thought it would be a something a bit  different. Room not ready champagne not in room as I ordered and u still have to pay for the awful budget breakfast as it’s not included. I’ve had better at services!!! 

Load of rubbish. Total rip off. Dossers hanging round in there Pjs at breakfast having an argument on there phone in front of everyone . Staff did nothing and all look really pissed off with working there. 
Not classy at all don’t waste you’re money. Real disappointment. Better hotels by far in London don’t think it’s going to be something amazing and special because it’s really not and neither r the folk that stay there !!!! ",2,2019,03,02
119,Birthday Treat,"Wife treated us to 1 night stay at the Yacht hotel.

We were greeted by smiling reception staff while checking in.

The hotel was beautiful and and both of us really enjoyed our stay.

Highly recommend. Worth a visit!",5,2019,03,02
119,Excellent peaceful trip,Would go again - stayed in Room 4030 and it was just so peaceful with the outdoor balcony overlooking the water. Really enjoyed the 2 nights.  Only had breakfast on one morning and if I had the chance again maybe I wouldn't have had that breakfast because it wasn't as good as I expected it to be :-( the Gin and Tonic that we sat and enjoyed late on the first evening was delicious but astronomically expensive!  Only to be expected I suppose.  The service and ambience was just impeccable.,4,2019,03,01
119,Fantastic Experience,"Loved our stay on the yacht, upgraded to an executive room so we could have a balcony and with the amazing mild February weather, we made the most of it!  The room had everything we needed, but it was a little hot, even with the aircon.  Had the set dinner, which was excellent, I am a gluten free vegetarian, and they went out of their way to accommodate me.  Gluten free bread and muesli at breakfast also.  The real stars of the place are the staff, polite, friendly and happy to help with anything, they were among the best I've ever stayed with.  The only downside is that the yacht was moored on the wrong side of the river for us, so we used the cab;e care as expensive public transport! :)  Overall, I would love to stay here again.",5,2019,02,24
119,"Great service, beautiful setting","Stayed at the Sunborn yacht for 1 night as part of a trip to London to celebrate my dad’s 70th birthday. We travelled as a family of 6, 4 adults & 2 kids (12 & 9years). 

When we arrived & checked in to our standard rooms we explained that we had also booked into the restaurant for my dad’s birthday meal. When staff found out it was his 70th, they upgraded him & my mum to a balcony room with river view which was a lovely personalised touch.

Food in the restaurant was lovely & great value for the money paid. They let us bring our own birthday cake & came out with plates afterwards. 

Beautiful setting made even better by glorious February weather.",5,2019,02,22
119,"Front of house service Terrible, Price Guarantee... a lie...","Ive stayed at this hotel regularly over the last 18 months, never had an issue, stayed in every room from a basic room up to a suite. Its always been a nice pleasurable stay.

The website had a price guarantee on. Its not actually a guarantee however, apparently according to management its a  price match, and only a price match if you call them prior to booking it to book it in. 

I booked a room for tonight, then instantly saw it was cheaper at booking.com. I queried this via email within minutes and had a response basically saying tough. Turned up and they attempted to charge the higher price, they refused to acknowledge or accept the price guarantee.

Front of house were dismissive and refused to help. Needless to say I didn't stay in the end and walked out. Very frustrated and wont be heading back",1,2019,02,20
119,Outstanding break,"Wonderful place to stay and be pampered, our original room was beautiful and we were very happy with it, apart from the heat, we couldnt get the temp down using the air con dial. We asked for assistance, and as it could not be recitified at that point we were immediately offered another room, which turned out to be a suite! we were over the moon, as this was a special 65th Birthday treat from myself to my husband, we had a wonderful stay.",5,2019,02,20
119,Excellent,"Absolutely fabulous place to enjoy a romantic break, exceptional service, great food. Quiet & relaxing. Riverside view room was stunning extremely clean & well presented. Helpful staff. A unique place to stay!",5,2019,02,20
119,Stunning!,"We stayed here for one night (wish it was longer). It's really beautiful,  the rooms are large and everywhere is very clean. We booked our evening meal, and were a little concerned as a lot of reviews said it took ages to be served, but the service was excellent and the food was delicious! I had the sea bass, and it was the best I've ever eaten. We also had breakfast and again it was lovely. All the staff are attentive and friendly and nothing is too much trouble. This is a fantastic, luxurious treat, and we had a wonderful weekend.
The only small niggle would be the rooms are very warm and the air con doesn't seem to work, but not a major problem. 
Also worth knowing, the Emirates cable car is very close, (we came over from Greenwich on it) and if you are visiting the Excel, you get a discount of £2
Thank you everyone!",5,2019,02,17
119,Great Christmas,"Had a great Christmas Day Dinner here on Christmas Day 2018, the food was great and the service was very good, there was a choice if any one did'nt want turkey my Grandaughter had Beef at it was cooked to perfection as she asked for, if we wanted there was a package and we could of stayed overnight, great experience",5,2019,02,14
119,Great location,The ship is very well furnished and the rooms are massive. The menu in the restaurant is below the quality it should offer but it’s fine. It’s just a pity that it does not match the 5 stars for everything else . ,4,2019,02,14
119,50th Birthday Celebration,"We spent a lovely afternoon and night at this hotel for my husbands 50th Birthday. The boat was amazing and we had an executive riverside room, with a balcony. The room was very clean and nicely laid out, with good fixtures and fittings. We had cocktails in the bar, which were amazing, my husband thoroughly enjoyed the Chocolate Martini! We got the cable car, which was very close, over to the O2 for dinner, which was fun and a nice thing to do at night, with all the city lit up.Breakfast was very good in the morning, hot and cold options were available. We definitely enjoyed our stay and will be back in the summer to enjoy the drinks outside!!",5,2019,02,13
119,Super Experience,Had a superb overnight stay. The staff were very attentive and the room with a waterside view was lovely and very well appointed. We had cocktails and an evening meal which for central London were very reasonable. We will certainly be back.,5,2019,02,13
119,Loved it!,"Had a lovely weekend away here. Great hotel, couldn’t fault it! Food is nice and so are the cocktails! 
Staff were very friendly and Happy to help.
Will definitely go back and Would definitely recommend",5,2019,02,12
119,Great experience,"Just returned from a night at the Sunborn and what a lovely evening.

We was greeted on arrival by a very sweet receptionist, who was very polite helpful and funny 

We upgraded to an executive room so we had a balcony which was lovely but I was a little scared to look over.  

Room was spacious, free WiFi, the toiletries were also very nice 

Room service was great, bar staff were very polite

Overall the stay was very pleasant and I’m glad we chose the sunborn",4,2019,02,12
119,Wifes 60th wake.,"Myself, wife and family (6 of us aged 60 to 22)  stayed here on a Saturday night. As we had booked early we were automatically given a Thames view and 15% off meals. 
Rooms  were a good size, bit fiddly as some equipment used uk plug and some two pin sockets which I had to hunt around for.
We all had different sized rooms as the nearer the front ( left hand side as you face the boat) the smaller the room.
We had a lovely stay with no real complaints and whilst not the cheapest in the world we would return.
I will be doing  a review of our evening meal and breakfast.",4,2019,02,04
119,Loved it,"My wife and I took a midweek break to London on the Sunborn after a friend had had a break there between Christmas and the new year.  We’ve stayed on the Sunborn in Gibraltar so we were keen to see how London compared.  
We arrived earlier than the checkin time but were greeted by lovely smiling faces at the reception desk and were in our room within minutes of arriving. 
The room was large, clean and a large king size double bed.  We had a dockside view which we were extremely happy with. 
We went to the bar for lunch on our first day for a snack and a drink.  Lunch was delicious, I had soup of the day which was butternut squash and sweet potato, my wife had a toasted sandwich and fish goujons between us. It was not cheap and we waited for quite a while but we were not in a rush so enjoyed the wonderful views along the Thames and the O2. 
My wife found the mattress a little hard so asked for an extra topper which was delivered within minutes. 
Tea and coffee making facilities are provided along with complimentary water in the fridge. 
We found all the staff friendly and extremely helpful, If there is a negative we found the food service very slow but as I said earlier we were there to relax so it was not a problem for us but if you are in a hurry it could be a problem. 
The ship is within walking distance of the Docklands Light Railway with Custom House station being the closest, about a 5 minute walk, slightly further is Royal Victoria dock station. 
There are restaurants close by as is the Emirates cable car ride over the Thames to the O2. 
All in all we had a fabulous break and enjoyed every minute on the Sunborn.

119,Education Show,"Stayed at The Yacht Hotel for 2 nights with 3 colleagues  for The Education Show at Excel.

The Hotel was very impressive, room was lovely, very clean, bed comfortably.

Breakfast plenty of choice, self service so quick.

All the staff was friendly, The Front of House staff were very friendly and helpful.

Would recommend and would like to return.",5,2019,01,28
119,All about the money!!!,"Booked this hotel for a midweek night away.  Good price for London hotel and rooms are good nothing that I have not seen in any other hotel, but roomy enough and clean.  Asked for a deposit of £40 on arrival in case we spent anything on board!  Very crass indeed.  We did not have evening meal at hotel which I decided against because of previous restaurant reviews so ate elsewhere.   A pre dinner drink in bar cost us £33.48 for two gin and tonics which did not come as advertised on menu which was with olives and rosemary.  They came with a piece of plastic dried fruit!!  Needless to say we did not have a nightcap after dinner.  On arrival at breakfast we asked for table for two and before we got any further I was informed ""you have not paid for breakfast so I will need a signature"".  It made us feel like we had been trying to blag a free breakfast!!! Again, very crass!  Breakfast is £19.95 per person, again nothing special.  Constant demand for money ruined our night away.  You have credit card details on booking I have no idea why you would think all this is acceptable, will not be back",3,2019,01,28
119,Could be excellent but...,"A group of 4 couples booked for Saturday dinner, overnight and breakfast. We were all delighted with the location and public spaces on the boat. Our rooms were really great- spacious, comfortable, stylish and spotlessly clean. 
As there was a big party dining in the restaurant we were asked to bring our bookings for dinner forward which we were happy to do. We were then informed that we would be eating upstairs, which again we were happy with; unfortunately this is when things deteriorated. The waiters were    great but were far too busy with the big party. We placed our order and waited an hour for our (cold) starters Mains and deserts were also slow although food was very tasty and well presented. A speciality coffee wasn’t available although a cappuccino and s separate shot of brandy were!!

Breakfast was a buffet and although the ingredients were good quality the room was overcrowded and chaotic. 

SO ....... great hotel but restaurant management let it down ",4,2019,01,27
119,Something a little different,"We have just had a lovely stay on The Sunborn. The room was immaculate and spacious, on a par with 5* hotels we have stayed at. The staff were very friendly and helpful with nothing being too much trouble. We opted for the dinner included package which was extremely good. Sometimes when you choose this option the menu is very limited and usually only the cheap choices are available, not on the Sunborn. A good choice of starters, including scallops cooked and presented perfectly. I had the sirloin steak which was cooked perfectly and my wife had the sea bass. Followed by really nice desserts. The lemon posset was lovely. Breakfast was buffet style and a little chaotic but still very good. There were a lot of families onboard, which we hadn’t anticipated but it didn’t make our stay any less enjoyable. Thoroughly recommend as something a little different from the norm",5,2019,01,27
119,A Nice Hotel,"We stayed here for three nights for my 40th. We booked without breakfast as the reviews weren’t good and it was £19.95 each.
Upon our booking back in August,Sunborn took a  deposit from my bank account, in doing this it ment i could not back out or cancel and they took the remaining balance two days before we arrived. If you do not arrive you will not get this back. Sunborn also fail to tell you upon booking that they also charge you £40 a night for extras. We were there for three nights and failed to see what extras we would be charged for unless it was for the two bottles of water in our minibar!. We refused to pay up front although you get this back but even so,i’d already paid £499 to stay there,let alone another £120!. We agreed on pay as you go, so if i drink the water you may charge me!. 
Our room was nice and clean and offered a lovely shower and a heated floor in the bathroom. Our bed was comfy and the room was overall Pleasant. Some reviews had mentioned about the boat being  noisy at night and i took earplugs with me as i didn’t want a lack of sleep to spoil my trip. I did use them as sometimes you could hear doors slamming and people talking as they walked past our room.
The boat is quite a way out of London,however,you can go to the Emirates cable car and go over to the O2,the Underground is here which will take you into London. Be sure to visit the O2 as there is an outlet shopping centre upstairs,be sure to visit the Lindt shop! There are many restuarants in the O2 which are nice to eat in.
Sunborn itself was nice,clean and comfortable but it is too far from London and because of this we would never stay again. It is also massively expensive and considering we were there to sightsee in London,£499 was alot just for a wash and to sleep!.",4,2019,01,27
119,Ahoy!,"The last time I was in the area, I saw the boat and I thought, wow, that looks fancy. So I decided to stay here. 

Upon arrival, I was checked in by the lovely lady who's name I didn't ask for but should have asked so I could mention her here. She wore glasses and she was super friendly. She upgraded the room which was really nice. Our room had a balcony facing the external courtyard area. It was a decent size room. We had a bit of trouble with the swipe card, as it took a few attempts to get in the room or make the lift move. The bathroom was nice, had a walk in shower and a hosepipe for your bum. 

Went for lunch the same afternoon, I was undecided between the burger and cheese and chutney toastie. I asked the barman who recommended the burger. I asked him and I took his advice. The burger was bland, the meat was bland. Not great. I did try some of the toastie and it was as if it was hand made by Zeus himself. This toastie was the best thing ever. The downside is that we had to wait 45 minutes for the food. 

We had breakfast and I went to choose a big plate. It was really greasy, like really nasty. Anyway, breakfast was actually quite nice once I found a clean plate to eat it from. During the night, it was really hot. The thermostat wasn't working so it was a very hot and uncomfortable. Bed was comfy but the crunchy sound of the duvet was annoying. Get silk duvets.

Staff here have swung it though. They were awesome so I would stay here again.",3,2019,01,26
119,Please fix temperature control ,"Lovely hotel and close to excel. Just can sleep because room to hot and thermostat not working. 
Have to sleep with balcony door open, which is not safe and noisy. Hope there is solution. Please read and fix. Thank you ",3,2019,01,24
119,Great venue and experience ,"It was our first visit to the sunborn yacht hotel for dinner and drinks... a great and unique venue.. well located and great views... food was good and staff very friendly and helpful.. special thanks to the bar manager Marcos, for looking after us and making the experience extra fab! It’s clear he is passionate about his work and the cocktail list is great... we will back very soon... Jeanette and Archie ",5,2019,01,24
119,Total Wow Factor!  What a unique hotel!,"The Sunborn is a little gem & totally exceeded my expectations.  The Yacht is beautiful inside & our room was big, comfortable & the view was amazing - over the water towards the Air Line & O2.  We paid extra for breakfast (which was a bit pricey) but for us it was worth it for the lovely view. I would definitely stay at The Sunborn again. We also explored the area & it’s an easy walk to the Thames Barrier Park. We also took the DLR to Canary Wharf & we enjoyed the liveliness, shops & restaurants here. ",5,2019,01,24
119,Good location ,"Stayed at the Sunborn Yacht Hotel in a lovely room with a balcony on the riverside.  We had room 4034.  
The hotel was easy to find. We took the cable car over and could see the yacht from there.  
This hotel would be ideal to stay in if you were attending a concert at the O2 as it is a cable car and a short walk away.  It is also close to London city airport and literally next door to the Excel.  We could hear and see the planes landing from the balcony.  We could hear them inside the room too, but it didn't really bother us. 
We didn't eat at the hotel so I can't comment on the restaurant or food.  We had two drinks at the bar in the evening which came to £28.50 which I thought was bit expensive. 
The staff were friendly and polite.  We enjoyed our stay and was very happy with the room. 

",5,2019,01,22
119,Absolutely amazing!,"We recently attended the hotel and had a breathtaking experience.

The spa area is small however the masseus was overly pleasant and extremely experienced and gave me the best massage I have had in the UK and there has been many to compare with.

We had the dinner option with a bottle of champagne which was 5 star from entry.  We had a very welcoming greeting which makes all the difference and all of the staff could not stop checking on us which was a lovely touch to the evening.  The team were very pleasant always smiling and pouring our drinks we were made to feel very welcomed.  The food was plentiful and extremely tasty with very nice portion sizes.

I opted for scallops to start followed by steak and sticky toffy pudding.  The food was cooked to perfection and well presented.  The temperature of the food was perfect.

The entire team deserve praise for such a beautiful experience.  We will return and have been recommending the establishment to family and friends.",5,2019,01,22
119,Pretty boat,Different and appealing hotel on the Thames.  A bit out of the way but ideal if going to ExCel or O2. The latter reached by cable car high across the Thames which adds to this pleasant and different experience.,4,2019,01,21
119,An enjoyable experience ,"We stayed here for one night.
We drove into London and made the most an app that offered alternative and cheaper parking locations. 
Our first view of the ship was from the other side of the dock. It looked impressive. When we walked into the reception we knew we were going to enjoy our stay.
The staff were very friendly and some how we were given a room upgrade.
The room was clean, tidy and spacious. Complimentary bottled water and coffee. Dressing gowns and sleepers were available.
I would recommend this hotel as a base to venture into London from. We used the cable car and spent sometime looking around the O2.
If you want something different then do try this place ",5,2019,01,20
119,A hotel with a difference,"We arrived late in the evening to the yacht hotel. Our first impression was amazement at the sight of it. We checked in and were told how to get to our room. The room was easy to find and was well turned out and spacious. We had asked for a room with a king size bed, but we got 2 single beds pushed together which left a gap in the mattress that we kept ending up in. Other than that, the room was nice and comfortable with good views and very quiet. Breakfast in the morning turned out not to have been included in the price but was really good, a selection of cereal, pastries and hot food as well as continental cheese, ham and fruit. 
As it was Christmas day, we asked about Christmas lunch and were told it would be £70 per person and served between 2-10pm. We decided to go for dinner around 7, only to be told that we should have booked and paid for it in advance and that there were no spaces left. This was the only thing that really bothered us during our stay.
The staff were generally friendly and knowledgeable of things to do in the area and were very helpful.
We have decided that we would use this hotel again in future as the few small issues were not enough to put us off from a good stay in a beautiful location.",4,2019,01,17
119,Everything good.,"We wanted something different and knowing it would be quite expensive over Christmas we decided to book 2 nights, Xmas eve and Xmas night. Although we couldn’t book in till afternoon for our room, we were allowed to book in early and leave our luggage. We drove down early to arrive for 10am. It was a pleasant surprise to see the cable cars running across to the ‘ O2’. It was not busy and with clear weather it meant the views from the car we’re superb. At the ‘O2’ we ate breakfast at the ‘ slug and lettuce’ and then shopped at the retail outlets.
Back on the Sunborn the room with river view. Was really nice. The staff were mostly polite and very helpful. Everything was clean the room was nice... we wanted the view and I wouldn’t book for land side if we went again.  Food was excellent. Bar drinks are expensive of course, however the lounge area is lovely and you definitely want to spend your time there.  We ate out Xmas eve night in a Resturant just on the corner of the road and then Xmas dinner was on the yacht, 7 courses.  Service was excellent.
There is a small tesco locally and people were bringing ‘ goody’ bags back for their rooms.
There were more children onboard than we would have thought but it wasn’t a problem for us.
Christmas Day was superb, relaxing and enjoyable.
It’s not cheap but a lovely treat for a special occasion.",4,2019,01,15
119,Afternoon tea on the Yatch!,"Amazing place !!

We booked an  afternoon tea on the Yatch for a 50th Birthday celebration. Although we were vegetarians the sandwiches and mini veg burgers were great. 
The hotel location is awesome, nice and quiet. Beautiful view. Due to winter we were not able to sit outside. We still enjoyed the services and their tea. Would definitely visit in summer. 
",5,2019,01,15
119,almost perfect,"stayed in this beautiful hotel recently for few nights with  the family, - location is great, rooms are clean and bigger then expected. the 2 reasons why its almost perfect - we stayed in the room  on the lower floor where windows for obvious security reason would not open - it was to hot to sleep and to have the air conditioning throughout the night was not enjoyable as it was simply to loud..also the bathroom was a bit dated, nothing major just some marks and scuffs all over.",4,2019,01,15
119,Very Good relaxing stay - just be weary of every service charge,"Sunborn Hotel is excellent in it's presentation and Service. Our room was spacious and clean with a large comfortable bed. We took Afternoon Tea on board which was very enjoyable with perfect service from the waitress, including a personal Birthday touch which was very much appreciated. The Hotel is close to the O2 and Canary Wharf with the Emirates AirLine nearby offering a different form of transport. 
The only negative was the addition of a service charge to every thing we bought, even a single drink from the bar.",4,2019,01,15
119,Lux adrift,"The Sunborn is a yacht shaped floating hotel, moored permanently in Victoria Docks. It is certainly an original and fun idea. There is an amazing attempt to look ship shape on both the inside and outside of the hotel. Very convincing for sure. The decor is beautiful and well polished. The staff are so friendly and attend to your every need. The 'boat' has great areas on 'deck' to relax and enjoy the views of London. There are lounge areas to relax and a great bar with excellent cocktails to enjoy. The dinner service was fabulous - Champagne is available by the glass.  The monkfish with puy lentils was delicious. 
A great weekend in a hotel with a difference.
The Emirates chairlift was a 3 minute walk away from the hotel - so lots to do and see in the area. ",4,2019,01,14
119,Pleasant ,"Stayed at the sunborn for 1 night, on arrival we was dealt with efficiently and told all relevant information. The receptionist does have to slow down speaking as it was hard to understand her. 

The cabins were beautiful, spacious and very clean.

We had lunch at the bar, and it was fantastic, the service was outstanding.

The breakfast was a little disappointing, incredibly over cooked and didn’t taste nice at all, when we told the receptionist this on check out, she refunded our breakfast cost without us asking with no question. 

Thanks for having us 
",4,2019,01,12
119,Birthday,"Stayed over for my parents birthday and it was amazing the room was lovely, spacious and clean the boat it’s self looked amazing the staff where every helpful and welcoming especially Salmony and Asia they went the extra mile to make are stay great definitely will be coming back even gave my partner a free birthday dessert. The food was really good as we had the afternoon tea great service and view.",5,2019,01,10
119,Could be much better,"My wife booked a 2 night stay for my special birthday, cabin/room was nicely decorated with balloons and a nice cake on our arrival however we initially noticed a smell in the room of  drains/sewage, this seemed to disappear so we did not bother mentioning to reception. We tried calling restaurant reservations to reserve a table for dinner but the call was unanswered, tried guest relations and again unanswered, ultimately called reception and was told the only menu available was on the tablet in the room, decided not to bother and went to the nearby Thai restaurant for my birthday meal instead. p.s, don't bother requesting the room tablet be released from the security cable to enable easier viewing, we requested several times and absolutely nothing was done.
On arrival back at our room we noticed it was quite noisy and this continued until after we went to bed, worse was on the second night when my wife had no sleep at all, sounds from adjacent rooms and above until after 2am and at times banging that made the glasses in the cabinet above the tv shake, all totally unacceptable in a hotel at this standard.
We did not call reception during the night for the simple reason that it would have achieved nothing at all. when we told reception of the issues the girl on the desk simply said 'oh that is concerning' but this does not help us.
You may say why not complain earlier, well my wife planned this stay months in advance and payed the hotel to decorate the room for me, I am not going to create an argument whilst at the hotel and upset my wife in view of the fact she had payed for the room to be prepared and decorated but the service provided at the hotel falls far short of expectations. The room we booked was on deck 2 no 2026  4th to 6th Jan 2019 , not sure what  is above this but be aware this room was very noisy.
Also in back up to other reviewers we found that the room was excessively hot even when the A/C was either off or at its lowest setting, bearing in mind that on this level the room windows do not open there is nothing you can do to ventilate the room, this also made sleeping difficult.
In summary I was really pleased with my surprise birthday but this was tarnished by the problems detailed in this review, what I find concerning is that there seemed to be absolutely no customer relations support, but damage has been done you don't get another birthday this year and can't wind the clock back and start again, would have gone back to the Sunborn but have real reservations with regard to returning",3,2019,01,08
119,Suitably different!,"Stayed here for one night, the night before NYE in an executive family room. Loved the decor and style of our room - bathroom was clean and compact with nice toiletries, Our bed was a decent size, and the kids also had plenty of room in what looked like a double sofa bed. We also had a great view of the river, and the O2 off to the right - we took this in after the kids had gone to bed and it was simply beautiful to sit there and just watch the Thames and the lights. I did not eat here - breakfast was £19.50 per person which is steep if your kids would likely only have a bowl of cereal, so cannot comment on the food, but the bar is nice, and a large glass of Pinot Grigio was about £9 so probably what you would expect to pay.
It may be right next to the Excel and in the heart of the Docklands, but it is only a painless 30 min tube ride to Waterloo, if that... and the Emirates Cable Car is a short walk away. There are a few restaurants and bars around here, but it would be worth looking farther afield on the tube or going across to the O2 if you want a livelier area. 
There are a couple of options of parking, although by far the easiest i found was the Royal Victoria car park which was very quiet, easy to find and a 2 minute walk from the hotel. Would definitely stay here again.",5,2019,01,07
119,Quirky! ,"This hotel was everything that we had expected. It was well staffed and clean. The rooms are very spacious which makes a change nowadays! It’s in a good location, about a 3 minute walk to the emirates cable car which is definitely worth a trip if you haven’t visited. We didn’t stay for breakfast as it was quite expensive. We stayed one floor underneath reception and so it was a little bit noisy in the morning but this was to be expected. The hotel stay itself was very reasonably priced. The beds were very comfortable and the shower was powerful! Nice touch in the rooms of complimentary water and coffee amenities. We will definitely be returning! ",4,2019,01,07
119,Quirky and unique.,"Stayed one night, staff friendly and room spacious clean and modern. We had a room overlooking the water which we requested given, which was nice. Little annoyances was that there was a awful smell in the corridor outside our room, thankfully it smelt pleasant in our room, mentioned it to the front desk, but I don't think anything was done about it. Breakfast was tasty, but slightly disappointing. Food was cold, tea was from a urn (much prefer from a traditional English teapot) and it was murky looking had a strange taste and had a load of tea leaves floating in it! The hotel itself is lovely Clean and very individual. So glad we stayed.",4,2019,01,06
119,Great find,"We took a last minute family winter break to London to visit the sites and stayed here after finding it on the Internet 
Wow how lucky were we - staff on check in were great - room - executive family was massive with a super king for us & large made up bed settee for children. Room was very well equipped with coffee machine, water, fridge, dressing gowns, big big towels & nice toiletries. Bed was very comfy
We had a balcony & view of excel
We didn’t eat or drink in hotel so can’t comment but bar @ restaurant looked good
Just down the road is the emigrates cable car & then we got on the city ferry for great views on London and stopped right at the London eye 
A must stay hotel for families in a perfect spot",5,2019,01,05
119,"Hotels ok, walls are like paper.","The hotel is absolutely fine and this review would have been a solid 4 stars, maybe sneaking a 5.  The rooms are spacious, well furnished beds are nice etc etc....

Sadly the walls are paper thin,  which is fine unless your next to a party room.  It’s 2am and they’ve been going strong for 3 hrs.  Reception couldn’t care less.  I doubt i’ll get any sleep. Possibly the worst nights sleep i’ve ever had.  

Looking out the window,  there are plenty of standard hotels in close proximity, book one of them.",1,2019,01,04
119,Let the stress sail away!,"My partner booked this for my 50th birthday as I had never been on a luxury yacht before.  From the moment we stepped onto the boat you could see and feel the luxury and the reception staff made you feel very special.  I felt I had walked onto the titanic  it was so stylish !  Once booked in we took the lift to our room on the top floor.  The good thing about this is that you have to use your room  card to work the lift above the reception floor so not just anyone can enter and walk around on your deck!

The room itself was not as big as I thought it would be but it was very classy and they had left me a tray of chocolate truffles for my birthday and a letter which I thought was a lovely touch! 

The bathroom had underfloor heating and was perfectly clean and shiny!  The only complaint I would say was there was a 'musty' smell in the room and corridors and not sure what it was really!

The view from the balcony was amazing, we watched the sun go down over the river and then the amazing backdrop of the London Docklands lights lit the view !  
We had a drink in the bar which is quite expensive - we paid £25 for two drinks a cocktail and a JD & coke (but we were on a luxury yacht)  and then went to the front of the boat to take in the London scenery at night - even the cable cars over the O2 were lit up !   loved it - so perfect!  reminded me a little of New York!  

You are certainly looked after at this lovely yacht hotel - very special night indeed !!",4,2019,01,02
119,Enjoyable stay,"The sunborn is a smart ship hotel and as such is fitted out to superyacht style which, despite its sleek modern exterior, is internally styled more akin to '90s executive'. That said, the rooms are well appointed, even the budget rooms on the lower decks with TV, Air Con, minibar, pod coffee maker amongst the usual in-room amenities. The room was spotlessly clean and the public areas were well looked after too. Upon check-in, the staff were friendly, courteous and efficient and despite arriving early, were happy to let us check in as they had a room available. We ate in the restaurant and reservation is essential as it is quite small. The food was excellent although not cheap and there was quite a long delay between courses which was a little disappointing. The only annoyance (and I'm being very picky) is the need for the lift to get on and off the ship. There is literally two feet between the level of the entrance walkway and the reception deck, yet you have to wait for the lift when you can see dry land on the other side of the glass! At check in/out time, the wait can be frustrating. All in all, a pleasant experience and a nice stay.",4,2019,01,01
119,Gutted...,"Upon arrival the hotel looked amazing, the car park was two minutes away so no issues there! Checking into the room, it looked lovely & quirky! 
However, we did have a few issues. The air conditioning wasn’t working so it stayed at 25 degrees all night & of course we didn’t have a window to open or ventilation! This meant we actually slept ON TOP of the covers all night! The TV wasn’t near the bed, even when you sat on the sofa the tv wasn’t central it was tucked into a wardrobe, wasn’t ideal! 
I mean, it was NYE & I paid £300 for just one night so I expected a little more than that! 
Then to top it all off, after checking out we politely asked where breakfast is served, to then be sent upstairs... we went up to them be told by a different member of staff that we didn’t have breakfast included! I showed him the confirmation of this and then he quickly showed us to our table. Even then, the food was stone cold & there was no fresh fruit, just basic bacon, sausage etc. We didn’t receive much attention from the staff & it definitely wasn’t worth the price tag. The bar staff had no idea what they were doing, on the night they were mixing up drinks & unsure on which order was for who! Nice if you fancy something different but wouldn’t pay that ever again for the hotel! 
A massive shame because we had very high expectations and had travelled over 3 hours to stay here. Disappointment is an understatement.",3,2019,01,01
119,Amazing Room - With Computerised Japanese Toilet!,"We stayed in Junior Suite 5032.

Suite had a lounge, dinning area and a separate bedroom with full en-suite including the amazing Japanese toilet! More on this later.

There was also a large balcony over looking the water across to the far side of the dock with chairs and table for four.

Room facilities included air con and heating with individual controls, 2 x TV’s (Bedroom and lounge), coffee machine and tea making facilities, sofa, coffee table and dining table and 4 chairs, safe, hair dryer and mini bar with complimentary wine, beer, sodas etc plus 10% off the restaurant and a complimentary late Check Out. The only negative is all but one plug socket is continental type similar to Spain so bring a converter.

Room decor is a little dated, but is standard ship fare.

Now for the toilet. It is fully automatic, seat rises and falls, and will wash, dry and freshen you up no mater who you are of what you done! Truly amazing.

",4,2019,01,01
119,"Hardware is fine, but staffs are not friendly","Comparing with many 4 stars hotel, the staff service provided is like a 3 star hotel. 
We didn’t know that taxi cannot go to the hotel entrance that we needed to walk about 100m to get to the hotel (there was a gate outside the pedestrian walk)  We travelled in family of 4, with 2 children, with many luggage. There was no one helped us with the luggage when we check in or check out. But somehow, some cars can drive near. what’s worse is we have booked a car to pick us up, the reception refused to open the gate to let our pick up car to get in. When I asked the receptionist to let our car in, she said we need to have a “blue card” - for disabled. We are tourists with many luggage, how would she expected we have a “blue card”, and I saw another guests (with no disable can Was allowed to drive in) 
If this is really the hotel location problem, they should better state it in the website. 
Thinking back, non of the receptionists have a smile on their face. I just feel they all don’t like their jobs. 
Others, the room is fine, and the breakfast is okay.",3,2019,01,01
119,Reservation Cancelled without Notice,"We had booked a night stay on the Sunborn Yacht Hotel for NYE 2018, and we had actually made the reservation one year in advance via Expedia. Our confirmation from Expedia had stated that the booking was confirmed and we do not need to contact the hotel to reconfirm, and that the payment for the room will be collected by the hotel upon check-in.

But when we went to check-in on 31 Dec 2018, we were told that our reservation has been cancelled as we had not contacted them a few months prior to make the payment, and that they could not contact us via the number provided. I questioned them on this as the booking was made via Expedia and we received no notification from Expedia that the hotel was trying to contact us, and that they could not have contacted me on my number as I never provided a number at time of booking. The lady at the desk insisted that they called me and as they could not reach me, they cancelled our reservation. However this was not communicated back to Expedia, as we received no notification of the cancellation (if we had, we would not have turned up at the hotel).

The lady at the desk was apologetic and we know she was just passing on the message from their back office. However needless to say we were very disappointed and annoyed - we had travelled all the way to London ExCel to spend NYE at the hotel, only to be told that there was no room for us. I do not believe that they tried to contact me (given I never provided a number and Expedia did not notify me of any attempted contact), and there was no T&C stating that we had to contact the hotel a few months prior to the stay to make the payment. The hotel looks nice from the outside, but we will not be booking any trips with them again.

Luckily for us, we managed to find a room with a river view at the nearby Crowne Plaza Hotel.",1,2019,01,01
119,So much nicer than hotels in the city for the same price!,"We stayed here for 4 days including Christmas Eve/Christmas before heading to another hotel in the city. I am so glad we did, the room was big and the yacht is gorgeous. The food was nice and the staff was helpful. We were initially given a room facing the dock so no water view but after asking the front desk, they let us switch to a better room. The train stop is very close so we used the train to get into the city each day except no trains on Christmas Day so we took a taxi for 28 pounds to the London Tower for our Hop On Hop Off bus.",5,2018,12,29
119,Christmas in the Docks,"A friend booked us into this hotel for Christmas so that we could avoid the usual hassle of preparing and cooking.

We had a great time. Firstly, we were upgraded and the rooms were well-kept and the beds really comfortable. There were a couple of niggles... neither the coffee machine, nor iron in one of the rooms were working, but these were quickly dealt with and discounted at the final bill. We also woke in the middle of the night to find the AC had reset itself and we were baking in 25 degree heat! However, we sorted it ourselves without bothering management so didn't feel worth mentioning.

Our first night was spent mostly in the bar with typically inflated London prices. Food, including breakfasts and Christmas lunch, was excellent and plenty on offer.

Throughout our stay, all staff were friendly and attentive, from the bar staff to waiters and nothing seemed too much trouble.

It's a bit fancy (and pricey) for a standard hotel stay, but I'd happily stay again for an event or occasion.",4,2018,12,28
119,One night stay,"The Sunborn Super Yacht is a must if you are wanting something a bit different to stay in.
Unfortunatley for us we had to cut our stay short due to a family crisis. The staff were so accommodating and very sympathetic. They dealt with us so well. As for the actual venue I hope to visit again one day. The Yacht is beautiful and very very clean. Our room was huge. The view wasn't great from our window but in the bar it was a lovely view of Canary Wharf and the Thames. Thank you to all the staff at Sunborn for your assistance and dealing with everything professionally.

",5,2018,12,28
119,Quirky alternative to usual hotel,"Fantastic place to stay if you’re looking for somewhere different. Upon arrival we got upgraded to a Thames view suite which was stunning. Very large rooms with smart and clean decor without any problems. Touch control for lights, air conditioning and a private balcony. 

Very friendly staff and great security, you need a key card to access any floors with rooms and to access the onboard lift. However, restaurant and drinks very overpriced with a full English costing around £20.. 

Overall a good location very near to Exel, The O2 and Shopping Centers and a lovely place to stay for a special occasion, perhaps not for a long stay.",4,2018,12,28
119,Very poor,"Disgusting smell in the lower deck, very stuffy inside, uncomfortable bed and broken air conditioning! Dirty mirrors and windows. Definitely not 4*!! Youths loitering and smoking outside made it very unwelcoming. Good security onboard though with regards to room keys unlocking lifts and doors.",1,2018,12,27
119,Ok but not worth the price,"The yacht is nice and the location good but the cost of the stay is overpriced. On the first night it was far too hot 26-28C all night even with the aircon on full. We couldn’t open the door to the balcony because there is a generator on the quayside which was far too noisy.
We were moved on the second night but it ruined our stay as we were all too tired.
",3,2018,12,26
119,Good alternative to central London ,"Stayed here for the weekend.. very nice different hotel in a great location .. ideal for the o2,Exel & the Emirates air line cable car. Very easy by tube to get back into central London . Go for the executive room with a balcony and view of the river. Lovely bar although the staff weren’t very attentive in the evenings when we popped in for a drink . Planes taking off on Monday morning started quite early and noisy ! Other than that it was a great experience that we all enjoyed.",4,2018,12,18
119,Very nice hotel.,"Very nice hotel.  Be careful when you check in though, when they ask you for a card to put any expenses on, don't give them your debit card as this will automatically take the money directly out of your account.  They do not explain this to you, so use a credit card if you can.",4,2018,12,18
119,"Brilliant, Superb and different","My works had an event in London for Christmas and a few of us chose to stay overnight here. Brilliant location, Great deals on rooms. Rooms spacious and comfortable. Bar very well stocked with a great selection. Food was nice also. Highly reccomended",5,2018,12,18
119,Something a bit different,We stayed for one night on the Sunborn Yatch as a Christmas treat. The rooms were fabulous and the restaurant breakfast very good. Bar drinks were very pricey but not unexpected bearing in mind the location. Transportation into London is easy via the DLR although we chose taxis for convenience sake. Would highly recommend this boat if you fancy something a little different.,5,2018,12,17
119,"Enjoyable stay, great bar in London's financial district","Three nights on the Sunborn while attending a conference at the ExCel. The room was on the 3rd deck, spacious and the bed was comfortable. Good bar for late nights, great views from the back deck and a great breakfast. A bit loud, especially in the morning; making it a bit hard to sleep in past 6am.",4,2018,12,16
119,Vintage class,"I was here on a work event and was impressed. The staff were excellent and the food was good. The rooms were very spacious and have everything needed. The only issue I have, is that it is a little dated. A refresh in to something more modern luxury and contemporary would make the Sunborn in another league. ",4,2018,12,16
119,"Clean, comfortable and relaxing easy atmosphere","Enjoyed our stay at this unique hotel. Lovely staff and great service. The location is a little off the beaten track if you have business in London city, but good for excel centre. The bar is especially relaxing with nice views of the dock and canary wharf. ",5,2018,12,16
119,Friday night stay.,"Had been pre advised there would be a power cut during the night for maintenance, which wasn’t a problem, what we wasn’t told was that we couldn’t use the bar (due to private function) so was limited to the little bar next to the restaurant.

The room was fantastic, clean fresh and great balcony looking out over the water, huge bed with quality duvet etc etc.

We had our meal in the restaurant, pleasant staff and very attentive, food was also well presented and good quality.

The night was completely ruined by people shouting, swearing, running down the corridors, banging doors when returning from their functions, then to cap it all arguments in loud voices up until around 4am.! Trouble was it wasn’t just one room you could ring down to reception about, it was several rooms with obviously drunk/semi drunk arrogant, thoughtless, idiots who had absolutely no regard for any other guests.!

So.. all in all, a very mixed experience, certainly the WORST nights sleep I have ever had in any hotel I’ve stayed in worldwide, good food, nice room.

So I don’t feel I can recommend.!

Alex.",2,2018,12,16
119,Excellent,"Delighted that my decision to stay overnight on a Yacht proved to be a good one.
The room we had was spacious, clean and benefitted from a port hole view of the river.
Bed was comfortable and with the usual tea & coffee making facilities we could relax and enjoy our stay.
Staff were friendly and the experience was excellent.",5,2018,12,15
119,Gorgeous,"We booked this as ""something a bit different"" - a birthday treat for a base while visiting the O2 - and were not disappointed. We were given a free upgrade from executive room to Riverside Junior Suite on the fifth floor (thank you!) and found the bed very comfortable.  The bar area behind the Reception is a lovely place to relax in with a great view, gorgeous cocktails and attentive bar and waiting staff. The feel of the hotel is elegant, but not stuffy or grandiose. I think they've got the balance just right. If I were to offer any critique I'd suggest that the room decor could be updated a wee bit (the bathroom was lovely though), but that's the only reason I can find that grades this hotel as 4star rather than 5. Thank you Sunborn.",5,2018,12,13
119,Room with a view to die for!! ,"This has to be in my top 5 !!! ... it’s not just the quirky feeling you get when you board nor the spectacular view ... it’s the service from beginning to end!! 

We loved it .... very romantic - thank you ",5,2018,12,12
119,Its the service that makes it!,"So, what to expect eh? A yacht moored in Victoria Dock. Didn't look much when we arrived but once in it was so lovely. Johanna on reception was fabulous, room was very good, whatever you needed the staff helped you with even getting the noisy disco on Saturday night turned down a bit.
The bed was unbelievably comfortable.
Ask for an executive room, river side. Food lovely, although had better but didn't want it to detract from overall fab weekend.",5,2018,12,10
119,Gorgeous felt like royalty,I took my daughter here for a night for her 13th birthday. A real treat for us both. Gorgeous room with all the facilities you need. Bed was so comfortable. Had dinner in the restaurant which was really tasty and u felt very special. The bar area and views are beautiful. A real treat for a special occassion,5,2018,12,08
119,Unique and lovely,"This is a different experience - a cruise ship hotel in London’s docks. 
As you can expect, the inside is splendid and awe-inspiring. The rooms are lovely, but the view of course is weather-dependent. 
Only downside was the breakfast which lacked variety and was catered by unfriendly staff ",4,2018,12,08
119,Fabulous .... I love this hotel....,"The review title says it all. If the location suits your requirements then select the Sunburn. I have been using it for the last three years and same high standard every time.

It’s a boat floating in a dock. The waterside rooms are best but all are fine. Centre staircase is impressive.

Given it’s a boat there a few charming quirks - but they just make it better.

Food great , staff great ( in all areas - reception, bar, restaurant etc)  , decoration maintained to a high standard, room maids excellent - absolutely spot on. Rooms well equipped.

Ideal for gigs at the with the cable car. Although you may need to Uber back,

",5,2018,12,07
119,Fabulous Sunborn,"We had an amazing 3 day stay on the Sunborn Yacht Hotel everything form the outside in was wonderful, clean welcoming and very high end couldn’t fault anything about our stay here. We didn’t have breakfast as we wanted to go out and about, however we did have evening dinner and it was beautiful the presentation speed of service and taste was perfect, the staff go out of here way to accommodate any request you have, the price of our 3 course meal was £29 + service charges all in all for 4 of us with wine, 3 course meal and more drinks was £260.00 between 4 of us such a great deal for London. We went on the Emirates cable car over the Thames then the boat taxi (returning same way later that eve) this cost £22 each what a bargain and got to see many famous landmarks along the way. Highly recommend this hotel we will definitely be returning.",5,2018,12,06
119,Perfect stay,"My wife and I stayed here for a romantic break away on the 30th November,for one night.
The Hotel, staff, and facilities were all exceptional.
The view from our room was really nice,especially in the evening with the London lights.
Great location.
Would deffinatly stay here again.",5,2018,12,04
119,Excellent Sunborn,"This was our 5th stay, as always excellent service from arrival until we left. Very friendly staff in all areas of the hotel. thanks to Agne for the lovely room allocated, we will be back again in 2019 ",5,2018,12,04
119,Super relaxed stay,"I loved this hotel, we had an executive king room which had lots of space. With a sofa/tv area and balcony it meant that spending time in the room was great. The coffee machine and tea making facilities were a great addition and made the morning very enjoyable. Getting into central london was easy. 
We also ate at the lands end restaurant. Both courses were delicious and all the waiters were so kind and helpful. Would definitely recommend this to anyone visiting london. Although it’s out of the centre, it was nice to-come back to somewhere quieter and more chilled. ",5,2018,12,03
119,Great stay,Really enjoyed our stay. Standard double room much spacious than any other hotel double big. Bar great. Views great and staff lovely. Especially Albina on reception and Andre at the bar could not do enough for you.,5,2018,12,02

119,Nice hotel but not as amazing as I had hoped,"Booked this for my husband's birthday, however I would have expected much more for the price I paid. The Yacht itself seems very luxurious, lobby and dining area are lovely and staff is very nice. Room is equipped with TV, toiletries, a tablet through which you can request services as necessary, or browse the internet. The bed/pillows are very comfortable, the sofa is extremely cosy and high quality furniture and items are used throughout the hotel.

However, our room's bathroom sink was blocked, which I made the hotel staff aware of but because it was evening time, there was nothing that they could do.

The air-conditioning was confusing to use and the room became boiling hot at night, so we couldn't sleep. I called a member of staff who came and supposedly turned the temperature down, however it was still quite warm until the next day and we had to have the balcony door open throughout the night to make it bearable. The gentleman did say that we could request an extra air-conditioning if room doesn't cool down sufficiently, however at that point (4am) we were just too exhausted and tried to just get the little sleep we could at that point.

The next morning, I requested some body lotion through the tablet, however the housekeeping lady brought me shampoo instead, so I requested body lotion again just to wait around for ages, with no one turning up. Later at check out I made the receptionist aware of it, and she said that body lotion is not available. It was shown as an option to request on the tablet, so I would have appreciated if I had known that no lotion will come, instead of waiting around before we finally headed to breakfast.

Breakfast was probably the most disappointing. I have seen better options in hotels where I paid a third of the price. The bread was very thickly sliced so you couldn't taste the rest of the food. The honey/jam were high quality but not enjoyable as all I could taste was bread. Very few options to choose from generally. I wish I had picked a different place to take my husband on his birthday and genuinely regret wasting my money.

Parking was £20 flat rate for 24 hours in the nearby Royal Victoria Car park.

All in all, the yacht and staff/services were very good, it was just the little things which somewhat spoilt the experience, especially as I wanted to make it special for my husband's birthday. Please provide more breakfast options in future, the current ones do not reflect the high standards that I would expect from this hotel.",3,2018,12,01
119,Just Wow!!!,"Great hotel, in fact I would go so far as to say the best one we’ve ever stayed in. Comfy beds, clean, awesome breakfast and just a great stay with attentive staff aboard. Quirky too with it being a yacht!",5,2018,12,01
119,Great birthday treat for my husband,"I booked with secret escapes never used this site before, very pleased. We had a three course meal in the evening, cooked full English breakfast that you could help yourself to great selection. Our room didn’t have a great view but lovely in size and a big terrace if the weather was better it would have been nice. It was pouring down with rain but in the morning a beautiful blue sky and quite warm, we had a walk after our breakfast. Someone was going up and down on the water in some sort of speed boat. It looked like a whale I think the hotels around paid him to do the entertainment tricks he was doing. Good to watch.
In your room there’s a coffee,tea machine enough for a couple of cups, plus a kettle, tea bags and a hot choc drink power. Large mugs are in the cabinet if you like a mug. Iron and ironing in wardrobe if needed. Staff are lovely and all look happy. I am very pleased I booked this for my husbands birthday.",5,2018,12,01
119,Lovey place to stay,"The sunborn hotel, it's very lovely the staff are very helpfully.
Rooms are very high quality, with everything you need.
Only downside is that there is an £20 charge for breakfast if you don't book with your room and £40 per night for an deposit which you have to pay when you check in.",5,2018,11,30
119,Something different,"Stayed 2 nights , room very spacious,good location for the O2,but a 40 min tube journey to the West end though easy connections via the tube / dlr,much cheaper than a taxi, breakfast and drinks expensive but it is London, would stay here again",5,2018,11,30
119,Perfect stay,"We have just returned from a one night stay celebrating my partners 50th birthday and the entire stay was perfection from the time we booked in to the time we checked out. Staff were so friendly and attentive and all wished my partner happy birthday and we were given a voucher for a complimentary glass of champagne at the bar which was a lovely touch to our celebrations. Anything we required during our stay was met immediately. The room was stunning, everything you would need was provided for you, only issue I’d mention was the king bed we had was two beds joined together so there was a dip in the middle and they separated during the night. However we will definitely return for future stays.",5,2018,11,29
119,21 Birthday Celebration,Booked for a special birthday was very nice of all the staff especially Robert who helped and understood that i wanted everything perfect and indeed it was .when emailed Agne (team Manager) she responded and thanks to her help.Was a well planned event and an absolute memorable day and a must be experience if you wana do something different.well done to the team & mostly making my twins enjoy their stay .,5,2018,11,28
119,Lovely stay for my mum's birthday!,"Booked this for my mum's birthday and it was a lovely treat. The rooms are impressive in size with big TVs, beds, and nice bathrooms. Dark room overnight which was great and very quiet. Nice bar at the end of the yacht was nice with a good view of the Emirates Air line and O2 Arena (although I had to send back my prosecco as it was flat).",5,2018,11,26
119,London day trip,Amazing staff amazing room amazing dinner ... oh and don't forget the cocktails in the bar .. ☺ overall we had a lovely time and we are coming back in the summer to drink cocktails on the deck .. didn't have the breakfast but will do next time.,5,2018,11,25
119,60th Wedding Anniversary family celebration,"22nd November family celebration. Very welcome and friendly Reception desk. Iona in particular. All 4 rooms were upgraded to Executive river view suites.  We enjoyed platters in the bar in the evening. The Service was a bit slow but it didn’t matter as we were enjoying our family evening. Slept very well with extremely comfy beds. The suites were very clean with facilities mentioned in other comments. Breakfast was lovely. The sausages and bacon in particular were very tasty. The only complaint if any would be that the hot food was not replenished quick enough leaving no beans or mushrooms for some time. Only one 4 sliced toaster when a couple would have been better.  My dad was struggling with walking the next day (aged 82) and we wanted to walk to the Emirates Air Line . Iona suggested that The Sunborn had a wheel chair we could use, fantastic suggestion. Thank you . We would all stay here again.",5,2018,11,24
119,Nice hotel but aweful staff,"Stayed here on the 18th of November for my girl friends birthday. Liked the hotel, stay and the beautiful neighborhood. But was terribly let down by staff particularly the lady at the breakfast reception o the 19th. 
She deliberately gave us a table in the corner which was the only table without any view of the water. When asked to shift she stated she cannot seat us anywhere else as they were 4 seaters and we were 2. She mentioned that there may be parties of 4 coming for breakfast. We went at 10:00 and it was closing at 10:30,all she needed to do was check her list. As it happened the entire restaurant area remained empty other that 2 tables...the table we requested to move to remained empty!! The lady was rude and it appeared she singled us out for whatever reason...
Will never go there again and would not recommend it to anyone...",2,2018,11,23
119,Almost perfect,"Booked this hotel as a surprise for my husband's 40th birthday and he was suitably surprised and he loved the hotel. This is a very cool and unique hotel and somewhere we will never forget. I opted for the executive room with a river view which was really good.

The whole place was awesome but I've had to deduct a star due to the top floor/deck being booked for a wedding so we couldn't use it all and this was the main reason for me to book the hotel- having drinks on a Super Yacht overlooking the Thames would have been lovely.",4,2018,11,22
119,‘Shorely’ worth a look,"We stayed here for one night as part of a weekend away. 

The yacht itself is impressive in size. On arrival in reception, the pleasant decour is immediately obvious and on arrival in our room (the cheaper dock view option) we were very pleasantly surprised with the size. More akin to a suite in any other hotel, the room was effectively a double size, a large bed and an attached ‘living’ area with sofa, tv etc. The bathroom was also decent size and everything was pleasingly arranged, a clear nautical theme as you’d expect and all spotlessly clean. 
One of the best features for me was how quiet the room was. In most hotels, however nice, you will hear the slamming of doors, people moving about etc. Not here, once the room door was shut we didn’t hear a thing, despite finding the next morning we had neighbours throughout the corridor, some with children. 

One disappointment for me was the lack of movement of the vessel. It is very securely fastened to the dock, so there is no movement at all and although I realise this may make it more feasible for those who don’t enjoy the ‘sea leg’ effect, for me it detracted from the novelty of staying on board - other than the decour and lay out you could have been in any hotel shoreside. My wife and I also found the bed very hard; this is despite having a relatively hard bed at home ourselves, we found ourselves waking up uncomfortable and even the pillows were rather slab like. This is a shame as otherwise the room was excellent. 

Service was friendly enough although sometimes a little slow in the bar, especially in the morning where we chose to have a light breakfast. In typical London fashion, breakfast in the restaurant will cost you around the £20 mark whereas we paid half that for coffee and pastries in the bar. Likewise in the evening, only a la carte was available when we booked at London prices. Instead we enjoyed cocktails and a lovely sharing platter in the bar, sat with a view out across the lights of the city. 

This for me was the highlight. I enjoy city views and from the rear of the yacht (where restaurant and bar are conveniently located) a good view across the dock finds the O2 and high rises of Canary Wharf and it’s surroundings; at night this offered a lovely light show, especially with the new cable car and their red lights floating UFO like across the sky. In the cold morning sunshine you could pick out bits you missed in the dark, and watch the DLR weave it’s way from the city past the dome. 

Location wise, this hotel is excellent. As someone who stays in London every year, I usually opt for the abundance of offerings of Kensington or somewhere central. The DLR brings you straight to the docks from Bank or the Tower in a short but very scenic trip, and it was really refreshing to stay in the east with such easy commuting links, including down to Greenwich via the city which on the DLR is a lovely trip in itself. The docks is nice and quiet but has restaurants etc if you want to go out but not venture too far. I’d highly recommend this as a location for a stay. 

Overall we enjoyed our stay, it has the X factor and the size of the room for London was good. A couple of things let it down as I have mentioned but otherwise I would recommend a stay here. ",4,2018,11,22
119,Lovely hotel experience,A great concept- small permanently moored cruise ship in Londons docklands.it is FAB. Upgrade to waterside cabin with balcony well worth it as considerably enhances the experience.lots of glass and crome and sweeping staircase in public areas.  Food and drink expensive- but food of good quality and well presented,4,2018,11,22
119,Afternoon Tea,"I arrived for afternoon tea with my cousin for her birthday. The young lady Salomy greeted us to take our coats and show us to the table. She then said she recognised me from a previous visit . How nice is that, I had been a few months before . 
Salomy is a credit to the hotel, her service skills are excellent,  she is vibrant and very friendly.  
I will definitely recommend the hotel. Keep up the good work Salomy.",5,2018,11,18
119,ALL SHIP SHAPE....,"Wow...what a very special place on the water. A magnificent floating haven that takes you to another world as you enter...

Even though I was late to meet my friend, the staff were understanding and welcoming. 
The afternoon tea was delicious (thank you Arturas) and the service was professional though out. 

A big thank you to Raygan (efficient and lovely on the phone) and Salomey who was delightful and engaging. 

I look forward to another visit. 
Highly recommend...",5,2018,11,15
119,"Nice views, delicious food!","We only went for lunch in the restaurant which was lovely and pleasant.
The guy who greeted us and showed us to a table was very friendly and polite eventhough we had not made a reservation. The food was delicious and beautifully presented. I had the corn fed chicken and it was the best chicken I have had.

It was a disappointment that we couldn't sit on the balcony (there you get the best view towards Canary Wharf) as it was only for smokers and it was full. The other thing I noticed was that there were mostly elderly people.

We visited the bar which was on the lower floor and that was nice and pleasant too and there you could sit outside and enjoy the view in the sun.
The lady who saw us off Teodora, was very friendly and polite too.

All in all a nice place to have a meal.",4,2018,11,15
119,Best Baby Shower!,"After having an an amazing summer spa and lunch experience at the Sunborn for my 30th, I returned in October to host my baby shower. From an organisational point of view, the events team made everything effortless. Ajay and Zivile were fantastic in making sure all my requirements were met.

I had a private function for 20 guests in the Sky Lounge where we were served a lovely afternoon tea. Everything was PERFECT! I cannot thank Salomey and Prenena enough for their super-friendly and attentive service. Salomey especially, went the extra mile to ensure that we were all looked after and having a wonderful time. To top it off, we were offered additional food and hot beverages.

Generally, each member of staff I have encountered on visits to the Sunborn have been so amazing that their hospitality is in a rare league of its own. I will definitely be back again!",5,2018,11,15
119,Weekend away,"We booked this hotel for a trip to London to commemorate Armistice Day.
The staff were friendly, the hotel was clean, the room was nice. But was it worth the money we paid?? No way. Hugely overpriced and not really that close to the centre of London. We had breakfast included, but this was average at best. It was like a 1980s premier inn. 
We had a nice weekend, but wont be rushing back at that price. ",3,2018,11,13
119,Loverly place to stay,"Very nice place with large rooms and probably the biggest bed I've ever slept in! I would give this place a 5 but there were a couple of things we didnt like.
What they failed to mention on booking was they want to block £40 PER NIGHT on your credit card just incase you run up a bar tab, glad I wasn't staying a week!
Also a little disappointed that after a nice day out in London we thought we would have a drink at the bar on our return, nope, no chance bar shut at 11pm and no drinks.
I would stay here again though. ",3,2018,11,13
119,Weekend Away,"We arrived early to the Sunborn and were greeted by friendly staff on the desk. Our rooms were not ready, which was fine and they offered to look after our cases.  Soon after we were given one of our two Family rooms. We had one Dockside and one river view.  I felt the Family rooms were dated and small, the balcony, disappointing. Two chairs will fit on the balcony, no table as I recall. The rooms were lovely and clean and the beds very comfortable. Tea, coffee and biscuits available. 

We had the restaurant booked for our first evening. Again, we were greeted by friendly staff.  I have attached photos of the menu. The food was ok. Certainly not the best I have eaten. My friend is gluten free and asked if the burger (without the bun) would be ok. The answer from the Chef was ‘we bring them in, can’t say what they are made out of’! I had the Pork, small portion but I don’t have a big appetite so that is fine. You will definitely need to order sides if you have a good appetite. It was tasty and of a reasonable standard but by no means excellent. Once the plates were cleared, we all discussed our desserts. Well, we needn’t of bothered. After about 40 + minutes of waiting for a waitress or trying to get her attention we gave up. The restaurant was busy. We did complain and the head waiter came and apologised. As the service charge was added to the bill, we asked for this to be removed. 

Personally, I wouldn’t stay here again, I’m glad I have, but I’ve done it and no urge to return. I wouldn’t recommend the restaurant as you can get better meals for the same price. ",3,2018,11,12

119,Amazing place to stay,"We were given this stay as a birthday treat. What a treat it was. It’s immaculate both times n the room and communal areas too. Staff were pleasant although it has to be said, the bar staff on deck need more training in customer care. We had our own balcony with our room and had sea views. It’s ideally situated and I can highly recommend staying here for a special occasion.",5,2018,11,06
119,interesting hotel location,"good cabin arrangement and interesting location. very close to the chair lift across to greenwich, takes oyster cards, and worth a trip. breakfast is ok nothing special, and dining is not at all special although the setting is excellent. there are some restaurants on shore nearby.",4,2018,11,06
119,Invited for a Saturday night stay by a friend to celebrate his birthday,"My wife and I were invited to spend a Saturday night on the yacht hotel by a friend celebrating his 64th birthday.They purchased a package that included dinner on Sat night and breakfast the following morning.
       The suite we stayed in was great and had its own deck area,a sauna,two showers and separate loo.The level of service however in the bar before dinner was appalling.Long wait for drinks .I ordered bar snacks,olives and cashew nuts and after a wait was told they had none.The service in the restaurant was even worse,luckily we were with friends having a good time and made a joke of it.The food however when it arrived was quite good.The breakfast service was as bad.We arrived at 10.00am to be told we would have to wait for a table.I counted eight tables that had not been cleared of dirty crockery.Our friend who booked refused to pay the 12.5per cent service charge on checking out.Overall disappointing,not 5star.",1,2018,11,06
119,Restaurant let's the hotel down,"Myself and my husband visited the Sunborn hotel for our anniversary. On arrival we were promptly greeted at the front desk. We were a couple of hours early, cannot check in until 3pm so decided to get some lunch and make the most of the hotel. At the restaurant,  the lady behind the desk was with a customer on the phone,  there wasn't a single member of staff available to book us in, despite the restaurant being empty. We waited for about 15 minutes to be told we could have a table at 1pm. Popped along to the bar for a drink while we waited. Bar staff were prompt and although we didn't have our room number at that time, they took our details so they could charge our room for us.

Sat at our table for lunch at 1pm, waited for a while for a waiter. There only appeared to be 2 members of staff at this point and the restaurant was starting to fill up. Although there are no complaints about the food,  it was delicious, service was extremely slow. 2 courses in 2 hours was ridiculous. We waited and waited and tried to get staff attention to order dessert, but gave up in the end. Again, staff took our details to charge our room.

Checked into our room, very spacious and clean with tea/coffee making facilities available. No complaints about our room.

Breakfast! We're seated straight away, told someone would be along to take our tea/coffee order. We waited....and waited...and waited....as did the couple in the table next to us. In the end, the couple next to us approached the member of staff who was checking guests in to breakfast. She very begrudgingly took our orders so we could go and help ourselves at the buffet. Again, service was slow and took time to arrive. Breakfast was good, a good choice if sparce. Food wasn't brought out quick enough to meet demand. The restaurant really let's the hotel down, they are extremely understaffed, I have no complaints about them, they were rushed off their feet and they didn't appear to be looking after their own tables, it was very chaotic. Tables couldn't even be cleared quick enough.

We checked out at 10.30am, have to check out by 11am. We were dealt with quickly, paid our bill but wasn't given a copy of our bill so had no idea what we were paying for and had no wag to make sure we were charged the correct amount.

Would we go there again? Maybe, but not if we paid full price. We booked through Secret Escapes and got a 40% discount. The restaurant really need more staff though.",3,2018,11,06
119,"Great for the O2 Arena, Accommodation good let down by staff!","Stayed her in October Geoff Lynne's ELO at the O2 Arena.  THe location and setting are brilliant for such events with the yacht being only five minutes away from The Emirates Air Line which takes you over the Thames to the 02.  On arrival at Sunborn check in was efficient and our room was excellent.  It was very spacious, nicely set out and very clean.   Once settling in we went for a look round.  We were not able to get a drink in the bar as ir was closed for refurbishment.  On seeing it later on that evening there were no signs of refurbishment so it seems that it was closed as they couldn' be bothered opening it.  
After the ELO concert we returned the Sunborn for a drink in the bar.  On our arrival it was quiet and there were a couple of bar staff working however literally just after we arrived a large group, possibly conference guests arrived.  They were extremely noisy and boisterous and the bar staff were just overrun.  Service was poor and the price for different rounds of the same drinks differed each time!  
 After a god night sleep we went for breakfast the next morning.  On heading for the dining room which was at the end of our corridor we were met by a large crowd waiting to use the conference rooms on-board  This meant access to the dining room was completely blocked and this meant a constant series of ""excuse me's"" and with some ignorant individuals just having to barge past!  Why the hotel couldn't have got the delegates to congregate in the empty bar until their conference rooms were ready is unknown but this would have saved an un-necessary and slightly unpleasant experience for paying guests.  On going into breakfast it was another disappointment, especially as they charge £20 per person for it.   The food that was left was only lukewarm and when that ran out the people who came in after us were left waiting for ages for supplies to be replenished with some poeple making several requests/complaints at what should have been an un-necessary delay.  we had to request a refill of the teapot three times.
I would certainly recommend The Sunborn for its location and ambience and room quality but as to the was it seems to be managed/staffed, these ares need major improvement. These items also seem to have been raised by other reviewers who have stayed here.  Overall after a great start on checking hill it went downhill.
If the staffing standard had been anywhere near the location and room standard then I would have rated The Sunborn as very good or excellent and unless these areas improve I would probably not recommend or use The Sunborn it again.",3,2018,11,06
119,The Boat Hotel,"WoW fantastic stay - Great location - highly recommended. Ask for an upgrade if you’re in a standard room - well worth it. 
Go for a walk over the bridge, great views - take a ride over the Thames in a cable car.
 If you want to eat at the Restaurant on board, book early is good advice. 
If you see any deals to stay on the internet - worth asking directly to see what the price ? The price booking direct may well be better.",5,2018,11,06
119,Weekend break,"Stayed on the Sunbourne this weekend just gone. Yacht very nicely decorated, bedrooms were lovely and big. Tip, if you book ask for river view as we didn’t know and our outlook was of the Excel building. Lunch was reasonably priced , breakfast at £20 was quite expensive and the same breakfast is the same at half the price in Premier lodges although it is London rates. Drinks were very expensive so take your own. Overall experience was good just make sure you take plenty of money with you",4,2018,11,06
119,Birthday treat,"Absolutely fantastic! What a break so different from the usual hotel stop over in the capital, front of house and restaurant staff where very friendly and very welcoming, evening meal was very good had bought a package including meals from groupon so great value, try and get  a cabin on the waterside great views and had the added bonus of watching a thunder storm from the balcony",5,2018,11,06
119,Beautiful cabin,"The cabin was eneromous, for once we had an extra bed in our room, and were still able to move around easily. The staff were slow, but it didn’t effect our stay too much as we were only there overnight,",4,2018,11,06
119,Underwhelming Experience,"Stayed for 3 nights in September with my Partner. Upon entering the yacht it looked beautiful. The elevators and rooms smelt like brass. The last night we stayed it took 3 hours for room service to arrive - which was cold. There was also some sort of function with loud music until midnight on a Sunday night which made the boat vibrate from the bass. Staff were unhelpful and I believe there are training needs that need to be addressed. Sadly we won't be returning, we stayed at the Crowne Plaza last year for the convention and will go back to them next year.",3,2018,11,06
119,Bitterly disappointing - we do not recommend at all - vastly over-priced!!,"I booked the Suborn London as a special surprise for my partner's 60th Birthday, following a recent family tragedy. So we were hoping for an uplifting and special experience in what looks like a luxurious boutique yacht. This was far from the case. I booked an Executive King room with a river view at a price of £331 for the night (breakfast for two is charged at £40 extra). The yacht is tired with rucked with stained carpets. The view was fantastic, bed comfortable, but the room was mediocre for the price  We had one large towel in the en suite, (again very mediocre),  two English Breakfast tea bags between us and one small packet of biscuits to share and no complimentary bottled water, which is what I would expect for this price. No satellite TV either - only freeview! The breakfast was also very mediocre. We made a complaint both to the duty manager and also to Head Office in Finland. We were offered a complimentary upgrade and breakfast (we would still have to pay for the room). We obviously declined this, as the facilities were far from the luxurious and the sumptuous experience that the photos of the Sunborn portrays on the website. We absolutely do not recommend.",1,2018,11,05
119,Perfect 1 night stay for 02,"Stayed 1 night (Sat 3rd Nov) for Bocelli at the 02.Easy 5 min walk to Emerites Air cable car over to 02 and back.We were back on board 45 mins after concert ended.Floating hotel has bigger rooms than other hotels but at £20 for breakfast,too dear !",4,2018,11,05
119,Return to the Sunborn,"One night aboard the Sunborn was enough to tell me that things are not what they once were when I first stayed here just after it opened. The room was splendid, spacious, comfortable and everything worked, except that we couldn’t seem to control the heating and it was far too warm. We slept, in the end, with the balcony door open. The mini fridge had only 2 bottles of water in it - if you expected a mini bar, given the presence of two wine glasses, you would be disappointed. 
Breakfast, which is self service and rocks up at a cool £19.50 per head, was a disaster! Overcooked scrambled eggs, anaemic smoked salmon, no marmalade or pastries and the world’s slowest toaster, when there was any bread available to toast, are just a few of the lowlights! Even the fabulous view of the river from the breakfast room didn’t help. 
We complained, when we checked out, and to be fair our complaint was handled efficiently. We received an instant apology and the cost of our breakfast was refunded.  I do hope that the Sunborn regains it’s previous high standards, as it is a very special vessel, moored in a very special place.",3,2018,11,04
119,Perfect for 02 arena,The yacht is very nice and secure. Drinks are expensive at £40 for a bottle prosecco.  We stayed when there was a private party so the main bar was closed off. Could use a bar upstairs but limited seating. We came back from evening out for nightcap but nowhere to sit so it might be worth checking if a party has been booked.  On the upside it is a few minutes walk from the emirates sky pods and that takes you practically to the 02 - worth doing day and night -amazing views and £3.50 each way.  I would stay again if I was going to the 02 arena.  Reception will book a taxi back for you and that cost £20.,4,2018,11,04
119,Andrea Bocelli Weekend,"Had a lovely time on the Sunborn Yacht Hotel. Very nice cabin with a balcony, a great nights sleep on a very comfortable bed. The night time view from the balcony was fantastic. Would definitely recommend it and would stay here again( if I can have room 2020 haha).",5,2018,11,04
119,Reasonable hotel for London,The hotel was beautiful. Ok it's not in the west end but the DLR service and tube service made it really easy.Food was reasonably priced for London so it's a win win.  Considering it's close to city airport it was quiet,5,2018,10,31
119,Great break on the Sunborn,Had a couple great days in London. The boat looked fantastic. The rooms were clean and more than comfortable. The kingsize bed was amazing. The facilities in the hotel were great. I would highly recommend the Sunborn for a short break. ,5,2018,10,28
119,Great stay...unusual weekend away!,"Me and my boyfriend stayed here January 2018 for a birthday/anniversary weekend away. Amazing time and the yacht was beautiful. We managed to check in slightly earlier than advertised. This was greatly appreciated as we had suitcases and bags we needed to drop off before we started our weekend exploring. We ate in the restaurant on the evening, I did pre book this just incase. Fantastic meal and service. We then went into the bar lounge area to finish off our night having some drinks! Would definitely recommend",5,2018,10,28
119,"Very good and different sort of hotel, convenient for the O2","Booked via Expedia, easily found about 5 min walk from Custom House ExCel Station on the DLR, looks v smart both outside and inside, efficient and friendly staff, super large room, comfortable bed, small balcony overlooking the water, excellent buffet breakfast.
The O2 is about 20mins away on the ""Air-line"" but note that this stops at 9pm so you have to come back by train. 
We really enjoyed our stay here and would recommend for the O2.",5,2018,10,26
119,Sunborn ,"We have just come back from a couple of days on the Sunborn 
The staff are wonderful really helpful
Bed linen was dirty and marked 
And it was very noisy doors banging all the time 
We wanted something close to the o2 so this was ideal 
But not sure I would return 
And wouldn’t recommend 
Sorry Sunborn but not up to expectations ",3,2018,10,26
119,Something unusual,"I stayed in at the Sunborn London Yacht Hotel because I liked the idea of trying something different to the usual city hotels. London offers a great variety of hotels and accommodation so I found this a welcome change and was happy to try something new.

The Sunborn London Yacht Hotel has been stationed in the new London Docklands area since 2014 and has been operating as a hotel since then. It is frequently booked for weddings, anniversaries and other events. The Sunborn has its own bar and a restaurant.

I stayed in an Executive Suite with river view. It was a large hotel suite with a small balcony which had enough space for 2 chairs. The suite had a flatscreen TV, an espresso maker, kettle, a refrigerator with free mineral water, and all amenities a luxury room would normally offer. The bathroom was small but had a good layout and a heater for towels. The decoration of the suite was elegant with a lot of warm wood tones and I really appreciated the small balcony to let some fresh air in during the night. The bed was comfortable with plenty of pillows and I slept very well.

I had a drink at the upper deck bar and it was nice to sit there and see people move by and taking pictures. The restaurant made a good impression, it was nicely set up and small but good choice of food was available.

The entire Yacht is nicely decorated  and my pictures show images from the suite, the restaurant and the hotel bar as well as the upper deck bar.

What I was not impressed about was the staff working there. They seemed to be more interested in chatting among themselves than taking care of their guests or giving information about the area or restaurants nearby. I also sent 2 e-mails with different inquiries to the hotel prior to my stay, but both of them were left unanswered. I find this behaviour very unprofessional and it does not give the guest a positive impression from the staff and management. Overall, it was a good stay but leaves lots of room for improvement to make their guests feel truly welcome.",4,2018,10,26
119,Lovely hotel. No complaints,"I booked this hotel as a surprise for my boyfriends birthday and we both thoroughly enjoyed it from start to finish. 
The staff at reception were very polite and friendly and had a quick and easy check in with directions to our room.

We had a river view room which you could see the O2 Arena from, and also watch the planes take off from London City Airport. With the balcony door open you could hear the planes, but as soon as the door was shut there was no noise whatsoever. I had organised a package with balloons and banners for a small extra cost, but they had also added some chocolates and confetti on the table which was a lovely extra touch. 
We booked through secretescapes and dinner on the yacht was included and the food was delicious. Good choice of food (and I am the fussiest eater) and I managed to find something for each course. We dressed quite smartly for dinner and didnt feel overdressed but there was a few people in just tshirt/trousers but they didnt seem to stand out. Not sure if there is a dress code?

We had breakfast included in our deal and this was so yummy! It's done as a buffet, but all the food is hot and fresh. They have so much variety of hot and cold foods. Fresh fruits and juices and hot drinks. 

The hotel is about a 5/10 minute walk from the Emirates Airline and Royal Victoria dock station by DLR. Its right next to the Excel Centre & there are a few shops such as Nisa/Tesco Express if you want to grab a cheap bottle of bubbly like we did :P

I would 100% recommend this to anyone looking for something just outside of Central London for a special occasion.",5,2018,10,25
119,Wonderful experience,"This was booked as somewhere to stay after our wedding, we had a wonderful stay in a really unique setting. We would strongly recommend a stay here. The staff were very courteous and full of smiles, reception in particular deserve a special mention.",5,2018,10,25
119,Father’s Day ,"It’s taken me over a year to get round to this review but I have to say that whilst the place seemed nice... we didn’t have a great experience with the reception... I booked this as a surprise for my dad and husband for Father’s Day, as we pulled up and parked we received a telephone call to say that our son had been involved in a motor cycle accident and we had to return to Southampton immediately as he was being flown to hospital, we spoke to the reception and they had nothing nice to say at all, in fact the reception said “you’ve paid in advance and there is nothing we can do for you” then she promptly moved onto the next customer.... now whilst I know there are rules around this type of thing a little compassion wouldn’t have gone a miss, we left my dad to stay and then travelled home, £500 for two rooms and only one used and a circumstance that the hotel could of possibly been a little lenient with! For this reason I wouldn’t book here again...",1,2018,10,24
119,Birthday Treat,"Was taken here for a birthday treat. Afternoon tea on the boat, meal at a near by restaurant, back to boat for cocktails and an over night stay. I have no idea how much the weekend cost but it was a pleasant stay. The rooms were large and comfy, the afternoon tea was great. Unlimited tea, extra sandwiches if required, glass of bubbles, scones and cakes. The cocktails were tasty but over priced for the size of them. 
The views on the boat were lovely, always something different to look at. My only negative was there seemed more rooms on the boat than things to do. You could only sit on one end of the boat. And it had a lounge area or restaurant. Would have been nice to have maybe a disco area or casino. Just my opinion, maybe I had too high expectation!",4,2018,10,23
119,Afternoon Tea,One of the best Afternoon Teas I have been too. The food was delicious and an added bonus was extra sandwiches. The restaurant is lovely with views of the river. The service was excellent. The staff were attentive without being intrusive.,5,2018,10,23
119,Average at best. ,"I had booked a stay here for a special occasion with my husband and I liked the idea of somewhere a bit different to spend time together. 
The stay was really average and not at any point did I feel special. Check in was quick but also very in-personal, we requested a bottle of champagne in ice bucket and glasses, was told it would be bought to room, it didn’t arrive. We couldn’t call up as the telephone in room wasn’t working. My husband went back to reception gain told it was coming. It never arrived. 
The room was really quite basic, out dated and worn out. Particularly the bathroom. There was no luxury feel to it. The window was so dirty on the outside that the view could not be enjoyed either. 
Breakfast was ok, had to ask and wait several times for fresh hot food items. 
This stay was ok, just didn’t offer a wow factor or luxury at any point and left us feeling disappointed especially after the high cost to stay there. ",3,2018,10,23
119,Unique birthday surprise for my daughter 🎁,"This is my second review  Sunborn as I feel despite a couple of issues which were indeed sorted out the whole experience was fabulous 👍Agne was so lovely when we checked out she apologised for the no hot water problem hence we couldn’t use the jacuzzi the second night and credited me accordingly .... and on the morning we left we made up for it and was great fun 🛁👍
The executive suite surpassed my expectations and the huge river view balcony was amazing 👍
Having planes flying over  brought another dimension and we loved  that too🛫
It was a nice touch receiving a complimentary bottle of wine too and with champagne 🍾 too we danced to the mama  Mia soundtrack both inside the suite and on the huge balcony lol 😂 
It’s a memory so unique to Sunborn with that location which we will treasure 👍
Enrique at the 02 was the other part of our experience and being able to use the cable car 🚡 10 mins walk from the Yacht was a real bonus 🙏",5,2018,10,22
119,50th Birthday Celebrations,"We visited 20th Oct, party of 8 for 50th Birthday Celebrations, fantastic location, the sun shone all weekend which make the views from the boat even more breathtaking.
Staff at reception were helpful & we managed to get an upgrade to a room with a balcony.
Rooms are fantastic, clean & spacious, we didnt eat in the resturant so cant comment on that...i so didnt want to end with a negative because we had a great weekend but i hope the team at The Sunborn will take this as a positive moving forward....The Bar Staff...there is nothing wrong with them personally, they are all very pleasent but sadly through no fault of thiers they could do with some extra training, like any quality place in Londo you will pay alot of money for alcohol, as long as the service is swift & the drinks are good you dont mind paying the price, it was all a bit chaotic behind the bar & we had to wait for very long periods for our drinks, also if you work behind a bar it really is your job to take note as you are working to keep a note in your head who should be served next, looking up & saying 'whos next..?' Is poor customer service & there was many disgruntled  people at the bar, im only bringing this to attention as i think if just a little more training was given it would have made for a 5 star Expireance, i would definitely recomend to visit this hotel to Expireance the whole setting.
",4,2018,10,22
119,Fab location,I had seen the Sunborn ship moored near the Excel centre and it had always fascinated me so when I saw a meal deal for the restaurant I jumped at the chance to go aboard. It was a lovely meal and the staff are delightful. You really get the feeling you are being looked after well. The restaurant area is lovely with lots of glitz and glamour and overlooks the river. We visited on a besutiful day and that made it extra special. The set meal was really nice and although the selection was not huge the food was beautifully presented. The ham hock starter was absolutely delicious as was the wonderfully tart passion fruit mousse. There were people having afternoon tea here as well. A really unique experience and I loved it.,4,2018,10,22
119,Horrible experience,"Just been from sunborn my boyfriend and I booked for his birthday weekendal get away. I also privately paid extras to have room with cake birthday banners all was done room clean great location. 

Nightmare started when we went for walkabout and came back to massive que to get in the hotel cos of wedding and we went for another unwanted walk to let everyone from wedding in.

We got in the amount of noise was not nice we went to our room changed went for dinner. we had booked when we did our hotel booking was told it was not in system but we were given a table told cos of wedding meal will be 10/15 mins to  wait I am  afraid it wasnot it was almost 2 hours no food the amount of noise we couldn't hear each other talk food finally came chips were cold the lady was confused whose steak was whose as I wanted well cooked my bf abit underdone we actually saw two couples complain and worked out.

Cos of the Noise as it was we just went to our room didn't do the bar. In the morning had breakfast checked out and did tell the reception what happened for all that bad experience was offered free drink lol after all the money we had paid plus extras I paid as birthday surprise it was bad and expected nice chill quitish weekend I was amazed .i Wish in future people are told that there is an event booked and if we wish to carry on with booking. I had waited years to be in this yacht hotel we saved up. What a bad experience. Hope noone goes through what we did. But I know we were not only people unhappy that night. 21 October 2018😠😠😠",1,2018,10,22
119,Great hotel deal,"We stayed here on the 12th October for 1 night and had a pleasant stay. The rooms were spacious, clean and room facilities were good. Loved the coffee machine and free water in the room. I also enjoyed looking out of the cabin window. The location was very easy to get to and easy to find. The only reason I am not giving it 5* and I am being really picky is 1. I didnt have the greatest night's sleep as there was lots of noise with people coming back to rooms so bangs of doors (not the hotels fault) 2. At breakfast it took a while for food to be replenished and that was with people asking I just feel like someone should be checking the food constantly to see what needed to be restocked. But saying that the breakfast was very nice particularly the sausages, coffee and mini croissants. All to a very high standard.

I recommend this hotel and I would definitely return. ",4,2018,10,22
119,Need to raise their game,"This review is written in the context of having stayed at the Sunborn Yacht in Gibraltar, which was exceptional from the moment we arrived until the moment we left.  We could not find a single fault with this hotel, and ran out of superlatives to describe it.

Unfortunately, that was not the case with the London sister yacht.

First the positives:

Great location

Glamorous yacht

Extremely clean and high standard of specification

Now the negatives, which were all service related:

When we arrived, the receptionists were all busy staring at computer screens so there was no welcome.

We waited at the desk until a young man came to check us in.

We were told the restaurant opened at 6.00pm.  No information was given about breakfast times.

We went down to our cabin and noticed that there were room service trays in the corridor, which was unsightly and also made smells.  It did not create a good impression.

We went into our cabin which was very spacious and well-appointed with a lovely view of the river.  No complaints at all with the cabin.

When we came out a while later to go up to dinner, the room service trays were still in the corridor.

We went up to the restaurant where two ladies were busy staring at a computer screen.

The restaurant was completely empty.  We waited for them to notice us, and when they did they seems surprised and slightly annoyed that we were standing there.

We asked for a table for two, and one of the staff asked if we had a reservation.  We said that we didn't.  She then stated that the restaurant did not open until 6.30pm.  My husband pointed out that it was 6.25pm!

A series of questions was then fired at my husband - name, email address, do you have any allergies? - we found this rather strange.

We were then led to a table in the empty restaurant.

I ordered a lime cordial and received a small glass of water with a slice of lime in it - not what you would expect from a top hotel.

We looked at the menu, which was limited, and, being vegetarian, there was very little choice and nothing we wanted to eat.

We asked our waiter if the chef might be able to make an omelette and this caused great consternation, with two different waiters going to ask in the kitchen.

The answer was that no omelette could be made.  One waiter tried to tell us the specials, but his English was so poor, it was hard to understand.  

We decided to leave the restaurant and go upstairs to the other bar, where we had two very nice meals.

We went off to the O2 to see ELO.  When we returned to our cabin several hours later, the room service trays were still in the corridor!!  No one had come round to collect them.

The following morning my husband went down to breakfast and described it as ""very poor"".

On checking out, we were asked if we enjoyed our stay, and we said that certain aspects of it had been disappointing.  

To his credit, the young man behind the desk said he was sorry to hear that and he removed our extras from the bill, which we felt satisfied was the correct approach to resolve the problem, and it made us feel valued that we were listened to.

The London yacht could learn a lot of lessons from the Gibraltar yacht as the customer experience is far superior.

Nevertheless, it is quite something to stay on the yacht and, on balance, I think I would do so again.",3,2018,10,19
119,Amazing Experience ,"My husband and I spent the night in the Sunborn London Yacht Hotel's Executive King Room with River View. 

It was an surreal experience.. The king room is beautifully decorated with a super king size bed which is so soft and cosy, not to mention the lovely white dressing gowns with slippers provided to keep you warm. There's a fridge with complimentary water, tea, coffee, biscuits, sugar and milk provided. 

The view from the balcony was spectacular with the cable cabs and 02 Arena as well as  the river activities seen in the distance. 

The restaurant which you've to book at least a week in advance prior to your stay served fabulous food and drinks at reasonable prices. All staff were friendly, professional and courteous attending to your every need. 

We knew from the moment we stepped out of the lift and saw the breathtaking stairwell which starts from the reception area and we're greeted by the reception staff that we were going to have a 
lovely night.

We had a perfect experience and plan to stay there again next year. ",5,2018,10,19
119,Fantastic stay,"I didn’t know what to expect when I booked this hotel for a 2 night business stay. From the moment I checked in I was so impressed. The front desk clerk upgraded me to a river view which was a welcomed surprise. Wow were my first thoughts when I opened my cabin door. Huge king size bed, in-room tablet, TV and all you’d expect to find.
I had a cocktail in the bar and that was delicious with outstanding views.
It’s in a great location close to DLR, the Emirates cable car and plenty of restaurants.
I would definitely stay here again and will be recommending to friends and family.",5,2018,10,18
119,Stylish and different,"I wasn't sure what to expect when I booked this accommodation because I had a conference at the Excel centre, but what a lovely surprise! Beautiful room, well equipped, and a lovely, luxurious interior to the ship as well. The bed was comfortable, room quiet, bathroom small but had everything we needed. Would definitely stay here again if I need to be at this end of London.",5,2018,10,15

119,Really great place for a different night away,"We had a great time here! Really big rooms in a great setting. If you get the weather the views are amazing.

The staff are very helpful and the room standard is very high. We were on the first floor and loved it.

Couple of little things. The breakfast service wasn't the standard you'd expect. We had to chase a couple of times for our tea and we were left looking at dirty plates until we left. 

Also when we first checked in we sat down for tea and a pastry. When they turned up we weren't given any cutlery or serviettes.

None of the above would put me off and I would definitely go back.

They make a great cocktail and the bar in the evening has terrific view of Docklands.",4,2018,10,13
119,Reservations,"My son and daughter in law booked a night on the yacht for their 1st wedding anniversary ( both work in care industry so a real treat for them) I phoned enquiringly about an up grade for a surprise and was lucky enough to talk to Ange who could not have been more helpful, she said she would try to put a plate of chocolates in their room. They will now have a view of the river. I think that management have got their training spot on, having such high caliber staff on the front line of contact.",5,2018,10,11
119,Fantastic alternative hotel when visiting the O2,"I stayed here last night after seeing #BTS with my daughter at the O2. It’s actually called the ‘Sunborne Yacht Hotel’ and it’s on s quiet Dock near the Excel centre.  A big white yacht with a fabulous glamorous interiior, spacious air conditioned room with lovely Ensuites and fab balconies overlooking Thames and O2.  There is the Emirates cable car just close by which transports you romantically over the Thanes to the O2.  Quiet and away from the craziness, but only ten minutes to our concert!  Attentive staff, smiling and warm.  Loved it! (Surrounded by nice restaurants).",5,2018,10,10
119,DO NOT BOOK - HOTEL WILL LEAVE YOU WITH NOWHERE TO STAY FOR THE NIGHT!!!!!!!,"Was booked to stay at this property last week. 

Had made the booking via booking.com who informed me ""No Pre-payment Required - Pay at the Hotel"", which was displayed in bold, green writing at the time of the booking, and also in the Terms and Conditions. 

Unfortunately, also in the Terms and Conditions, a lot lower down, and in total conflict to this, it was stated that the property could ""take a pre-authorisation"" of your credit card to guarantee the room. 

As I had made this booking may months ago, due to a lost card my card details had changed. When this hotel tried, WITHOUT PRIOR WARNING OR ANY AUTHORISATION FROM ME, to take this money from my account, and it was not possible, they sent me an email asking me to amend my card details within 22 hours (ALTHOUGH 24 HOURS IS SPECIFIED IN THE TERMS AND CONDITIONS). At the point the email was received I was on a flight and did not pick up this ""eleventh hour"" email. 

As a result of the above, by the time I arrived at Gatwick Airport I had received a further email stating that my booking had been CANCELLED!!!!

I WAS THEREFORE LEFT STRANDED IN LONDON WITH MY YOUNG SON AND NOWHERE TO STAY!!!

AS A RESULT I HAD TO SPEND A FORTUNE ON AN ALTERNATIVE LAST MINUTE BOOKING AS THIS ""HOTEL"" AND BOOKING.COM REFUSED TO DO ANYTHING TO CORRECT THIS SITUATION. 

I HAVE WRITTEN TO THE HOTEL AND AM AWAITING THEIR RESPONSE, HOWEVER I WOULD LIKE SOMEONE FROM THEIR HEAD OFFICE TO BE IN TOUCH IMMEDIATELY AS I WILL BE TAKING LEGAL ACTION AGAINST YOU UNLESS YOU RESOLVE THIS SITUATION. 

NOTE TO ALL TRAVELLERS - DO NOT RELY ON ANY BOOKING THAT YOU GUARANTEE AT THIS HOTEL AS THEY ARE ONLY INTERESTED IN PROFIT AND WILL CANCEL THE BOOKING LEAVING YOU STRANDED!!!",1,2018,10,08
119,Birthday treat ,"I found this hotel via groupon which I never usually go on! We was blown away with how amazing it was, staff was lovely! It was clean and so beautiful! I’ve recommended it to all my friends and family! ",5,2018,10,08
119,Avoid!,"My partner booked me a surprise night stay on the Sunborn. On Arrival we arrived at reception (which was lovely to look at) and checked in. We were asked for a £40 deposit which was fine. We were then asked if we were eating at the restaurant and if we wanted to book a table to which we said no. 
After entering the room (which was the executive suite and looked like a standard premier inn) I noticed the rose petals and champagne he had arranged. The rose petals were FABRIC and for £40 more to add them and 4 chocolates you would expect real!? After being in the room 5 minutes we decided we would eat at the hotel. We rang the bar and the reception for 5 minutes straight until we finally got an answer and they told us there were no tables!? We then asked for room service to which they replied you should have a tablet in your room to order from- which we didn’t. So after a rude phone call somebody came to our room and gave us a menu for room service. After choosing a burger ( as that was all there was for a main basically) we rang back and waited another long while for someone to answer. A man on the phone rudely said we had to order from the tablet in the room again. We didn’t have a tablet! So he hung up and two minutes later he was at our door. 
He instantly realised that we were telling the truth and didn’t have one in our room to which we were told “only important guests get the tablets” £400 my partner had paid for one night! After getting very annoyed and explaining I would be complaining he then proceeded to tell us that quite a lot of people had demanded a refund and walked out in the last few weeks. 
After a lot of faffing around and him telling us that actually we could order things from the restaurant up to the room but, because we didn’t have the tablet we now couldn’t, we finally managed to order the bland over priced burgers. 
After getting to sleep finally at around 2am when the loud music from the party next door had finished, I was then awoken numerous times in the night by loud banging. 
Went down for breakfast in the morning to then be told we hadn’t booked it and it would be an extra £20pp we stormed down to reception who told us we had indeed booked. We managed to get 50% off the total cost but to be honest we really wanted to get out of there so I will be pursuing this. 
This was in no way the romantic get away they make it out to be and staff seem to have no idea what they are doing.",1,2018,10,07
119,Disappointing,"Having stayed there last night I have 3 suggestions:

1. Retrain your manager Laslo. Possibly the rudest manager we have ever encountered. Maybe also teach him to smile and have some manners. 

2. Train all your serving staff as they were all (with one exception) rude. 

3. Fix or replace the dirty torn and threadbare carpet before someone trips on it. 

The only positive was you very nice and helpful check in staff.",2,2018,10,07
119,"5 Star Yacht, 5 Star Service!","Absolutely thoroughly enjoyed my time in this one of a lifetime opportunity. Decor was gorgeous- in the room, and out. Bar staff were super friendly and attentive. Dio was absolutely delicious and to die for! Definitely be coming back soon. ",5,2018,10,07
119,Thanks to Algirdas ,Very pleasant stay. Reservation staff specially Algirdas is very intelligent and he knows how to run the business and care for their customers. So thanks once again to Algirdas and other team. I must say to improve the breakfast as there were not many option to choose for vegetarians but staffs are really helpful and approachable.,5,2018,10,07
119,"5 Star Yacht, 3 Star Service","2nd visit to this beautiful yacht. I love the old fashioned elegance and warm welcome at reception. Our room was large and  lovely and we were upgraded, Super king bed, adequate bathroom, veranda with a river view, I could sit there for hours watching the changing moods. I would give all of the above 5 stars, however, all service in the bar was poor, rude waiter, dirty tables, wrong orders, ( on both occassions we used it) we came for a special occassions but used a local bar for our pre- dinner drinks as the Sunborn bar did not match our expectations, I don't mind paying London prices if we would have had decent service.  Our complaints were heard and compensated but that is not the point. We came for a special occassion but didn't have special service. Also no à la carte Monday to Thursday which was disappointing, although the meal was ok and again service not top notch! I love this yacht but would think twice about coming for a third time!",4,2018,10,05
119,A breath of fresh air in busy London,"Stayed 2 nights at the Sunborn Yacht while in London for business. Great hotel, classy and comfortable room, friendly staff. Although situated close to London City Airport, slept like a baby :-). Will definitely come back.",5,2018,10,04
119,A great experience - relaxing luxury close to the city,"It was right next to the DLR, there are a selection of restaurants nearby and the rooms are a really good size and luxurious. It’s a unique experience in London that offers relaxing surroundings at easy reach from the centre.

The staff were amazing, especially Elsa, who was fantastic with my daughter.

The bar and restaurant both looked nice and I would certainly return for a night with the family.

They provided a cot in the room which was clean and beautifully prepared and a proper coffee machine and kettle in the room.",5,2018,10,04
119,One of the best weekends!!!,"The hotel is lovely and amazingly the rooms are set out the exact same way as a real cruise ship!! The decor is beautiful and the staff are helpful also.

When we arrived we headed straight to our room to drop off our bags! The sun was shining so we headed to the bar and ordered some drinks and light snacks. We sat outside and enjoyed the views and refreshments! We had to wait a little longer than we liked but when the drinks and food came it was worth the wait! 

The next morning we went for breakfast (included in our booking) which was a lovely selection of hot and cold items, fruit, cured meats, cheese, cereals etc! There was a wide selection which was nice and the hot food was actually hot!!!

We managed to get a late check out which was definitely needed! 

Overall I would definitely stay again! The location is great, and there is so much to do in the area! After we checked out we went on the Emirates sky line over to Greenwich to The o2!!!

Perfect for couples, and romantic weekends!! 10/10",5,2018,10,04
119,"Fine, but nothing special","I’m a fairly regular visitor to ExCel with work so have enjoyed several of the overpriced, mediocre hotels available at the Docklands. With that in mind, and having passed the Sunborn on multiple visits, I thought I would check it out this time. It’s OK. I guess I may have fooled myself into assuming this would be a somehow different hotel experience. It’s not. The room is fine, save for some small factors that I found annoying, namely (and with hindsight, predictably) you can’t open the window (porthole). I like to sleep with the window open so found the inability to do so a bit stuffy. Also, the room had no desk, making work / room service a bit of a challenge. That said I didn’t bother with room service due to the very poor selection available. I’m glad I tried the Sunborn, but I don’t think I’ll rush back.",3,2018,10,03
119,Hotel with a difference ,"Fabulous place to stay in London.  Excellent location for the exhibition centre. Rooms are fabulous, comfortable beds and great views if you have riverside view. It makes a welcome change to the usual
Hotel rooms ",5,2018,10,02
119,Great visit ,"Wow my first time staying at the Sunborn, I did really enjoy it. We got upgraded on arrival which was lovely. All the staff were very helpful with great customer service. It was very easy to find and a great location if visiting the O2. 
I see other reviews saying how tired the inside looks which it does in places but very clean so not a big issue for me. Would definitely stay again for sure as the beds are SO comfortable.
My only moan is the breakfast was definitely not worth £20. Other than that great experience ",4,2018,10,02
119,Nothing special at all.,"I'm amazed that the yacht has such a high review if I'm honest! Having recently spent a weekend with friends on the yacht I have to say I won't revisit. I was hoping I'd come away eager to spend another weekend here with my husband but that's not the case. The rooms are no more special than those you'd find in a travel lodge. The breakfast was sparse. Had to ask for hot drinks twice whilst we were seated too in the morning. The decor really isn't anything plush imo. We had a room that overlooked the Xcel steps when standing, and whilst seated on the balcony our only view was the metal casing around the area of our balcony. All that said, the staff couldn't be more helpful on the front desk so 10/10 for those members of staff. Sadly I just don't think it's worth the money at all.",2,2018,10,01
119,Excellent Meal and Service,"My wife and I and two friends had lunch here one weekday. The restaurant is within the Yacht Hotel, the yacht being docked on the Thames in London. It is definitely a lovely setting, with seating overlooking the Thames, both inside and on the forward deck. There is a dress code, smart casual, with shorts, tee-shirt, etc. not being acceptable. More casual dress does seem to be acceptable outside as we saw someone with torn jeans led outside! There is a good menu with an interesting selection of meals. We found the service and the meals excellent, although a little slow, but that was not a problem for us as we were not in a hurry and enjoyed taking in the ambience of the lovely setting.",5,2018,10,01
119,Affordable Luxury,"My wife and I visited the Sunborn overnight as part of a package to see “The Ceremony of the Keys” at the Tower of London. 
Our cabin/ room was enormous, immaculate and very luxurious with a Super Kingsize bed and very well fitted out bathroom with a large shower. We had a Thames view with a picture window which was very pleasant. Tea and coffee making facilities provided were very good. WiFi is free.
Breakfast was part of our package. It was excellent with a good choice to suit all tastes.
Restaurant and bar prices were quite expensive.
Staff were very pleasant, friendly, accommodating and efficient.
It’s proximity to the O2 means there are an abundance of Restaurants and bars close at hand.
We would most definitely return.
Just one word of caution - the close proximity to London City Airport means there is some aircraft noise in the outside areas.",5,2018,09,30
119,So upset,"I booked the Sunborn hotel for last night. My partner and I came to London for the weekend to celebrate a life event. We were so looking forward to it, sadly I was taken Poorly on Friday evening and was admitted into Guys and Thomas and have to have an op tomorrow. I called the sunborn yesterday to explain and to see if they would let me have a credit for when I get better, I had fully paid for the trip. The sunborn said no sorry we can not offer you another opportunity unless you pay again. How disappointing when the trip was booked in such good faith and I was so looking forward to it. Shame on you Sunborn. ",1,2018,09,30
119,Amazing,"Booked this for an anniversary treat, the whole experience was wonderful staff friendly and welcoming. The views are stunning and although just a short way from city airport it’s very quite in the rooms which are well furnished and comfortable. Would definitely stay again, the staircase is amazing. ",5,2018,09,29
119,Girls weekend!,"Fantastic location for a girls weekend/get together. Quiet location so be prepared to walk if you don’t want to spend your whole stay on the yacht. Lovely large, clean cabin. Accomodation reasonably priced but food and drinks on the sunborn very expensive! Don’t book this if you’re on a budget",3,2018,09,28
119,Lovely hotel with a stunning backdrop,"We stayed on a Thursday night for a gig at the O2 which is easily reachable via a 10 minute cable car ride on the Emirates airline (which closes at 10 midweek, so the return was on the Tube/DLR) rooms are big and clean, bed very comfortable and an afternoon sitting on deck in tge sun and drinking prosecco and sampling the bar food was awesome if a little expensive. Highly recommended!",4,2018,09,28
119,Amazing stay!,"A great location, picturesque views from the bar terrace, easy access into central London, lots of choice of places to eat locally, room was lovely and spacious and very clean, friendly helpful staff.",5,2018,09,28
119,Stunning Boat but.........,"My husband and I stayed here for our 14th wedding anniversary on 22nd September not even the rain or traffic on the A12 could dampen our spirits. We parked at the Royal Victoria car park £20 for 24 hours which is a 5 minute walk to the Sunborn. Even in the the rain the boat looked stunning. 
Front of house was our first point of call slightly disappointed as I’m use to a  warm greeting a smile  and eye contact when i arrive at a hotel, even if it’s just to say ""we'll be with you in a moment"". Checked in received a top floor room as requested very happy with that. The room was really nice the tablet was a nice touch as was the robe and slippers and the complimentary hospitality tray and wine glasses.
We travelled by the emirates cable car (£7 return) to the 02 to grab a meal.
We had breakfast which was included in our room rate I’m so glad because I would have requested a refund if it wasn’t definitely not value for money at £19.50 I would expect more in choice and standard. Once again lack of customer service was a letdown no friendly smile or interaction from the staff standing by the greeting table on our exit they were talking to each other looked up and straight back down.
We called downstairs to request a late checkout no one picked up so we didn’t pursue that. 
Check out time 3 members of staff behind the desk 2 looked up and looked straight back down not even “we’ll be with you shortly”  key handed back not even a “how was your stay” 
Hoping to get my £40 deposit back soon as they said 2 to 3 days we are now on day 5.
Glad I can tick the Sunborn of my bucket list but I won’t be back 
",4,2018,09,27
119,Great hotel,"Stayed for one night as we were going to the Kylie concert at the O2. The hotel is amazing, very clean. The bedrooms were great, we had an executive room which had a balcony with river view. The bed was massive and really comfy. Went across to the O2 using the cable car which was brilliant. Highly recommend if you want something different from the normal types of hotel in the area.",5,2018,09,27
119,This is a must visit especially if served by Salomey,"Went there today for lunch and had the most first class service from Salomey, and the food was absolutely outstanding. Had seabass for our main course and the whole plate of food was cooked to perfection. We will definitely be back and each time, introducing different friends. Salomey was friendly, gave us great recommendations and had the most infectious smile. See you soon.",5,2018,09,27
119,"Great hotel, great location","Loved this hotel.  Great location and very nice inside and out.  The rooms are big and well equipped.  Staff are very friendly and helpful.  Only complaint is that the breakfast was poor value for money. Very convenient for the Excel centre, O2 and London City Airport",5,2018,09,27
119,Lovely Night Away,Lovely Night away after hospital appointments. Was easy to get to and only a 3 minute walk from Custom House Station.   Right next door to the Excel Centre.  The rooms were very big and sumptuous even the Classic Rooms,5,2018,09,26
119,"Terrible service, terrible afternoon tea","Went there with friends to celebrate my birthday. From the moment we were seated the service was terrible. We were offered water for the table but this never arrived. We waited 20 minutes before anyone took our order. We waited another 30 minutes for the food to arrive - yes 30 minutes for a couple of sandwiches and a few cakes. We each requested another plate of sandwiches and after waiting 20 minutes, they only brought sandwiches for 1 person (there were 3 of us). We asked again and was informed by the manager that five more tables had arrived and they were being served first so we would have to wait. We asked again and was told she’d have a look but she never returned. We asked again and finally our sandwiches were delivered to us. The scones were like rocks and were clearly at least one day old. The cakes all tasted the same - apart from the one which had two tiny eyelashes (looked like fake ones) on top of it and I was told by the waitress that it was dust!? After being there for almost 3 hours, we left most of the food and left. The only reason we were there so long was because we were waiting to be served. After my complaint about the eyelashes we were left for one hour and no one came over to us at all! Not one person apologised to us either. Don’t bother going there.",1,2018,09,26
119,The room was both comfortable and spacious.,"Both me and my wife stayed here recently the yacht itself is located less than a minute's walk from ExCeL Centre London, the Sunborn is a floating super-yacht hotel boasting a bar and a restaurant. In the restaurant, a buffet/continental breakfast is served each morning and an a la carte menu is available in the evenings.
Custom House Docklands Light Railway Station is 5 minutes' walk away. It offers direct routes to Westfield Stratford City and Queen Elizabeth Olympic Park. Emirates Royal Docks Skyline is a 5-minute journey on foot. It offers a direct route to The O2 Arena.
We were both enjoying our stay here as the room was both comfortable and spacious with air con and all of the comforts you would expect at this level the only problem we had was the service, my wife was poorly so I ordered breakfast with an extra charge to the room the night before but unfortunately the breakfast didn't arrive and we were then being asked to vacate the room! so after making a justified complaint everything was rectified and the food arrived and everybody was happy, as a Brit complaining is something were not comfortable with as its not inherent in our nature maybe if we did we would receive better treatment?
Anyway alls well that ends well!",4,2018,09,26
119,Superb Location & Quality Food,"My wife and I plus two of our grandchildren stayed on this beautiful boat permanently moored in the former Docklands. It has good parking facilities nearby, notably at the Royal Docks just a short walk away. It is an iconic setting with some of the old dockside cranes preserved to add atmosphere and history. 
The boat has lifts from the dockside to the main reception area and this is bright and welcoming. The check-in was smooth and friendly and we had a room (3020) overlooking the Thames with a small balcony. The room was very comfortable with double bed and sofa bed for the children. The decor is predominantly walnut with quality fittings. There is a good bathroom with shower and wash hand basin. A fridge stocked with water and plenty of wardrobe space plus a useful tablet with information on the hotel and access to the net are all there. 
The bar has a lovely terrace with views over the Thames and the nearby Emirates sky lift. We enjoyed a fish and a meat sharing platter in the bar at lunchtime which had whitebait, salmon, prawns, beef, ham hock and chorizo all served with tasty dips. The flavours and variety were really good and plenty for four people. Well worth a try.
Breakfast was served buffet style in the restaurant and this ranges from fruit up to the full English. We particularly liked the cold meat selection smoked salmon which was on offer. The grandchildren loved the milk chocolate drink which was a block of chocolate on a stick immersed in hot milk.
We found the staff friendly and very helpful throughout our stay and the food is outstanding (see restaurant report). If you want an interesting place to stay in London with quality and style we thoroughly recommend The Sunborn.",4,2018,09,24
119,Disappointed. Expensive but could not live up cost. Tacky deposit demanded on checkin & £10 for a school dinner desert.,"Could have been good, but was expensively disappointing, poor food and uncomfortable child's bed.
1 night, 2 adults & 1 child with breakfast cost £358 Executive Family Room = 1 double bed and 1 sofa bed pre paid. I felt annoyed at being asked for a £40 deposit. Reception stated it covered cost of mini bar & I would be reimbursed at checkout. I was told sofa bed already made up. It was not.
6pm Dinner... 
I wanted sirloin steak, medium rare: Waitress took order & then informed me meat is fatty and might be a bit tough, if I am okay with that!?
No, I would be okay with that. Reordered.
The food quality for the price is terrible. And £10 for Sticky toffee pudding that would make any school dinners' cook embarrassed... Executive Head Chef, Patrick Piscopo must have had a bad night that night!
Mini bar only had water in. Why had I paid £40, especially when I have my dinner bill to pay for upon checkout?
Our child had very uncountable night's sleep. When I tested the sofa bed it was very uneven and uncomfortable. This makes any parent agree. You charge so much money and cannot provide a good bed for my child in your Executive Family Room...
Sunborn had potential to be an enjoyable stay, but was a very disappointing £489.44. I will never return.",2,2018,09,24
119,Amazing Experience but..... ,"It was an amazing room. Lower deck overlooking the water. Fantastic facilities in the room. Photos included. Even had an iPad. It was peaceful The whole stay and the decor was exquisite. Very luxurious. Included was your hairdryer, luxury shampoos etc, iron and board. Plenty of hangers and bright due to so may mirrors.
The bed was very comfortable. 
The reception staff were helpful as were the waiters. 
It does what it says on the label. My cousin stayed and her room as closer to the front on the yacht so seemed more cluttered. She didn't have a sofa and table as we did. But hey! It's to sleep in and soundly we all did. 
The rooms were spotless and the housekeeping team were lovely.
I've completed a separate review for the Lands End Restaurant, which sadly isn't as positive and I would encourage you to eat else where. 
The venue is brilliant. Two stations close by. We drove and parking through parking+ was so cheap. The Cable Cars to the 02 and north Greenwhich are on the doorstep. There are plenty of great places to eat and drink around the yacht.

119,Expensive cocktails and drinks,"Cocktails menus not unto date on price and descriptions if you order a drink think you should be told if something missing no mint half a glass of cocktails at £11.50 because Incorrect size GLASS ? 
Evening menu Greate but asked for vinegar for chips only had salad dressing come on we are in the uk always vinegar with chips 
Breakfast ok but tea coffee cold not asked as we sat down what drinks we wanted had to wait not welcoming service had to ask for sweetener never turned up .
Receptionist very good 
But the hotel out of the way nothing around it only good for one night rooms lovely",3,2018,09,23
119,Overnight stay,Spent a lovely night on the Sunborn hotel. The staff were very helpful. Beautiful room with a large bed. Would definitely stay again. Nice location we parked overnight at the excel centre which was a five minute walk away.,5,2018,09,22
119,Our anniversary non cruise expierence,Upon boarding it felt like we were taking a real cruise.The impressive spiral staircase when checking in has to be seenLoved the sheer size of the cabinsCarpet in the restaurant let the side down a little,4,2018,09,22
119,Ok-check the bars will be open!!!,"This place is ok. I had a great night sleep and the room size was really good. 
It was a little noisy in the morning on the ceiling. 
It was just minor things which when added together put you off, considering the price. If I’d had these issues at a premier inn I wouldn’t have even thought about them.
We paid extra for a room with river view- it’s not really worth it as the window is so dirty it makes it look quite gloomy. It’s also not a fantastic view as the window isn’t that big. 

The plug sockets in the room did’t feel very secure and where the coffee machine was left on a table to be plugged in- the plug wouldn’t go in that socket (they have a lot of 2 pin sockets) so we had to carry it to the other side and balance it on an uneven surface to the right plug. We also had to call reception to get more coffee pods as there was only 1 kind from the choice listed. The gentleman on reception at check out seemed to struggle and kept asking the same questions it was confusing but we got there. Just not very smoothly.All pretty minor.

The main disappointment we were unable to get a drink or use any of the facilities like the bar or restaurants due to a Private function taking place!? I found this unacceptable as we had no prior knowledge of this before hand when we booked nor had it been brought to our attention at any point until we went to try and get a drink. Extremely poor service for the guests. 
",3,2018,09,22
119,Lovely stay,"Lovely stay for one night on the sunburn for boyfriends birthday. 
Had a classic river view room which was very spacious and clean apart from the window - was annoying trying to look out at the lovely view with such a filthy window.
Bed was comfortable and at night it is total darkness which proved for a great nights sleep. 
Had the set lunch menu on the boat - totalling £80 for both of us with one glass of wine. It was nice however just standard and not sure if it justifies that amount of money. Also the carpet in the restaurant was filthy - ruins the whole appearance.
Overall was a nice stay - staff were very polite however seems a bit over priced and a bit overrated.",3,2018,09,22
119,Absolutely beautiful,"Such a lovely hotel, with a feeling being on the Titanic.. lovely eye-catching lobby.. wonderful staff.

119,Awful service...but a lovely boat,"We came for for husband's birthday weekend, and although the yacht itself as lovely and the rooms very great, we were let down by the incredibly poor service. The front of house team need training, and to learn how to smile and the restaurant staff need to understand good customer service. It's a shame that it was let down by the poor staff. ",2,2018,09,21
119,Good concept let down by poor service,"The yacht and facilities look the part. The rooms are big and clean with excellent linen and towels. A fantastic comfy bed and good bathroom. The reception and public areas are clean and to a good standard. However, whilst the reception staff and all the housekeeping staff are friendly and helpful, other service areas leave a lot to be desired.  Attending the bar when back from the theatre at 11pm the staff were stood chatting in large group. We had to wait to be seated by an unpleasant waitress who left menus with us and explained nothing about service. We waited ten minutes for table service until I approached the bar and despite seeing me was ignored by all staff stood chatting until finally a rude barman instructed me to sit down and a colleague would soon be over. After another 5 minute wait our Drinks order was finally taken and dispatched but only after confirming we had indeed ‘paid our deposit at reception’ when questioned rudely.  The £12.50 prosecco was awful and the glass unclean. We left for our room to be rudely shouted back by the barman who embarrassed us publicly by proclaiming we had not signed our bar tab (despite giving our room number at the beginning) and therefore making out we were attempting to walk out without paying! We apologised as they had not explained their process and they promptly made us wait another 5 minutes to print the chit for us to sign as he shouted out again to a colleague, for all to hear, that we had left without signing to pay.  Highly embarrassing and unnecessary. Whilst the hotel facilities were excellent I would not stop here again as I was made to feel like I was an inconvenience and a thief by the bar staff. This Thoroughly unpleasant experience ruined our stay for us",3,2018,09,20
119,Be very wary of inflated prices.,"Booked this hotel after booking to see Peter Kaye at the o2.  It was also my birthday weekend.  To get the 'best rate' we had to book and pay at the same time.  Very pricey for 3 nights, over £1000 but it had been recommended.  As we all know Peter Kaye had to cancelled and as we had prepaid we thought we would see a west end show instead so booked one.  Not long before we were due to travel I looked at the web site and was shocked and dismayed that the price was now more then £140 cheaper per night. A total of more than £400 for the 3 nights.  I emailed Sunborn who basically told me tough.  That was the price at the time and I was stuck with it.  The room was a good size and quite pleasant but the bathroom needed attention.  Lots of nasty brown chips in the white tiles and a sink plug that you had to lift if you wanted water to drain away!!  Didn't eat or drink in the hotel as they already had enough of my money.  Then the real let down.  So much for a peaceful Sunday lie in.  There was something happening on our floor (4th) and there were people, boxes and clothes everywhere and a lot of noise. It was bedlam.  We had to avoid people as they chatted in the corridor to each other or on the phone and there were photographers and interviews on the main landing just in front of the lifts.  On one occasion there were 2 people in one of the 2 lifts having a photo shoot totally oblivious to the fact they by holding that lift open the 2nd lift would not come to that floor.  They were not at all interested that we , the paying customers, were waiting!!  Of course we had not been made aware of this event and then of course the party continued until quite late and we were only a few rooms along from where it was all happening.  One thing in its favour was that the receptionist was very pleasant.  If I pay that sort of money for a hotel again I will make sure it is worth the money.  Unlike the Sunborn.",2,2018,09,19
119,Good Stay but Would probably avoid breakfast,"Stayed for one night as we were at The O2 & didn’t fancy travelling home too late. Room was great & bar area very good. Only issues were £19.50 for a lacklustre breakfast - Powdered egg is not acceptable for that price. Also, there’s nowhere to work in silence once you have checked out",4,2018,09,19
119,Birthday Weekend Away,"Booked on Groupon for a standard room with breakfast for two people. Was ever so impressed with the room, the yacht itself and the views were beautiful. Staff were polite and approachable. Breakfast in the morning was lovely with such a nice view out of the window !  

The only things that were disappointing were that the mini fridge in the room didn't have anything in, the room service was ordered via a tablet and there was a £4 delivery charge for already pricier than normal items (£3.50 for a lemonade and so on).

Was not told any information about the beauty treatments available would have definitely booked one if given more information !",5,2018,09,17
119,50th birthday celebrations,"We checked into the Sunborn yesterday for 1 night of sheer luxury,  professionalism and romance. From the moment we stepped on board, we were graced with utter beauty of the reception area with the gold stairs and chandeliers. 

We stayed in a classic cabin overlooking the Ex cel exhibition centre. The room was amazing just like in the picture, fully equipped and more that comfortable. With complimentary water, hot berverages and complimentary chocolates and a lovely welcome/Birthday note.

The rooms are non-smoking,there is designated smoking area behind the reception area which has a bar and outside smoking terrace over-looking the river and water sports.

We didn't have dinner, but if room service breakfast is anything to go by, dinner should e amazing. 

Drinks are quite pricey, so I've your on a budget,  there is a local supermarket nearby where you can purchase snacks and drinks.",5,2018,09,16
119,50 birthday celebration,"Lovely two nights stay in unique setting. Bedroom lovely clean and comfortable. Settee cosy bed luxury. Restaurant wide selection of food accommodating vegan vegetarian celiac etc  food delicious service not the greatest but food
Made up for this. Bar area very pleasant service good. Enjoyable stay. Exceptional views close to transportation and Greenwich and 02.  Emerites airline was brilliant and useful as was ferry service",5,2018,09,13
119,Overnight stay,"Just fabulous. Had the wow factor for a surprise birthday night away. Great location and easily accessible to the tube and inner city London. 
We had dinner on the yacht too and it was excellent. Great choice, service and food. 
Breakfast was good with a wide choice. 
Rooms were exactly like cabins on a cruise, spacious and clean. Couldn’t say anything bad about it. 
Will go again definitely. ",5,2018,09,13
119,Wonderful place to stay - not so sure about the restaurant,"I booked Sunborn for our weekend in London because it looked like something a bit different and I am glad I chose it. The reception area is glitzy and looks like a cruise ship and all the corridors etc were clean and easy to navigate.  We were in one of the standard cabins with a river view and the room was spacious, comfortable, and well-equipped, and my only gripe is that the window didn’t open to let some air into the room.  There was efficient aircon so it wasn’t a major problem just a niggle really.
 
We were joined by family members for a meal on our first night (we were celebrating both our birthdays) and sitting out on the deck sipping cocktails whilst watching Canary Wharf light-up was a wonderful way to start the evening.  The restaurant ambiance was great and I really wanted the food to match but sadly it wasn’t as good as I hoped.  Nothing was particularly bad it was just that the portions were small and whilst everything we ate was fine it just seemed underwhelming when you consider the location and appearance of Sunborn, not to mention the price!  The service in both the restaurant and bar was very efficient and polite.

I had breakfast on one morning and there was a good selection – something for everyone, although even the cooked breakfast was self-service rather than freshly cooked to order which was disappointing when you consider they charged £19 for it.  The second day I went out and had similar for half the price.

So Sunborn is a great place to stay and I would certainly return when we are next in London, but I’m not sure I would use the restaurant again.",4,2018,09,11
119,Best stay ever!,"I loved everything about this stay, planned this surprise trip for my partner’s birthday and the hotel listened to my every request executing it perfectly. The rooms are magnificent with a super comfy bed, snack bar, coffee machine, WiFi and great TV, the view from our balcony was amazing also, plus the food on the yacht itself. Staff were super friendly and the area overall was nice. I will definitely return and stay here again.",5,2018,09,11
119,Great stay,"We stayed in the sunborn for my partners  birthday , we were up graded fee of charge to a river view with balcony the room was huge , an very clean all the staff were lovely  and very helpful,  we had booked dinner and all I can say is the food was amazing  not rushed , the bar was a nice atmosphere,  and wonderful  views, for the deck over london at night  can't recommend  it enough .",5,2018,09,08
119,An experience,Staying on a super yacht in London with great views across to the O2 and Canary Wharf. An experience that was good. Reasonably priced good large cabin. Recommended. Service good and helpful. Breakfast a little expensive though.,4,2018,09,06
119,Great place to stay,"Great place to stay but very expensive food and drink, we you use this hotel as a base again, very clean and tidy we got upgraded on arrival at no extra cost but the cost of there food and drink felt like a bit off a rip off £40 for 2 breakfast is crazy.",3,2018,09,04
119,Anniversary stay,"We stayed here for our wedding anniversary as something a little different. 
We got the Thames clipper from London eye to North Greenwich where we hopped on the cable car. I recommend this than the boring tube and DLR, gives a much nicer view of London.
The Sunborn is around a 500 yd walk, turning right out of the cable car exit.
The yacht definitely has the wow factor and immediately the cleanliness was apparently as you take the lift up to reception.
We stayed in a river view executive room which was huge, spotless with a huge super king size bed which was so comfortable.
The quality coffee machine is a lovely touch however not enough milk. Complimentary water is provided in the fridge for you.

We had a cocktail in the bar at the rear however the drink selection I personally found quite poor and vastly over priced for the area. 
We found better cocktails elsewhere for half the price.
Lovely Thai restaurant a short walk from the hotel Nakhon Thai, I would totally recommend.

We will definitely return to this hotel especially as it’s very convenient for the O2 arena and Excel.
",5,2018,09,04
119,30th Wedding Anniversary,Arrived as I'd booked 2 rooms. Had a little blip with booking.com but the hotel manager Mr Arun Kumar could not have  been helpful enough. It was all sorted out and I found that when I got to my room I had a upgrade. Absolutely fabulous room. The staff were very helpful and friendly. The hotel restaurant was excellent. Please book before your trip as it tends to get booked very quickly. Excellent restaurant staff. The food was very good. The drinks are on the pricey side. Room and all amenities were excellent. I cannot fault this hotel at all. I had the  most fantastic stay and the most fabulous weekend. I would definitely recommend the sunborn and Mr Kumar and his staff to everyone. Will definitely return in the future. I can honestly say this made my Anniversary special. I loved my time here. I had a riverside view with a balcony. It was fabulous.,5,2018,09,04
119,An worthwhile experience - depending upon the cost,"The yacht looks impressive from the outside and is a short 5-10 walk from the excel centre where we parked (£20 for 24 hours )
Having to enter via the small lift is odd but the main reception is visually impressive with its spiral staircases and chandelier. 
The corridor to our room on the fourth floor was less impressive with many trays littering the floor and the carpets rucked in many places, which nearly tripped my wife. 
The room itself (King Room with river view) was fairly large  and the many mirrors and window/door to the balcony made it quite light.
The shower is large and worked well with big towels of a good quality, robes and slippers are also provided.
The balcony itself was small (with two seats but passing each other is a bit of a squeeze) however the views were worth it with the O2 and Canary Wharf one side and the Excel arena and London City Airport the other. 
The proximity to the airport may be an issue for some at the planes fly very low past the yacht as they come in to land.
We were unable to reserve a table in the restaurant so I would recommend booing early if you want to do that, though there are other restaurants in easy walking distance. We did enjoy sitting outside in the bar having a cocktail though, but be prepared to pay £11 for it !
Overall we enjoyed the stay it’s a nice change from standard hotels and the river view king room is worth the extra but only at the reduced/discounted rate, we paid £145 for a Sunday night, had we paid the full cost I’m not sure I would have seen it as such good value.",4,2018,09,03
119,Excellent anniversary weekend,"Booked this for our 25th wedding anniversary as wanted somewhere a bit different to stay and was not disappointed.  Its easy to get to and well situated for and explore around docklands, greenwich etc.  Staff were friendly and our room (executive river view) was large and lovely.  Very large comfy bed and great view of the river.  Got a deal on secret escapes to include dinner which offered great choices and food was excellent.  Also included breakfast which was also pretty good.  Nice outlook from the restaurant and bar area.  Emirates cable car very close by.  Also had a lovely meal in nearby chinese restaurant on 2nd night.  Highly recommended.",5,2018,09,02
119,Very disappointing!,"I bought afternoon tea for my parents and family as a present and was impressed by all the things I had read about this hotel. However on arrival we were greeted by someone who asked to take a seat and someone would come and seat us in the restaraunt, however they forgot and we had to remind them. It took 40 minutes to be served our tea and all I can say is the quality of the food was shocking. I was expecting hand made delicate sandwiches and hand made cakes. What we received however were clumsy sandwiches and what can only be described as dry stale mass produced cakes, the likes of which you find in the cheapest of supermarkets! I felt so awful that we were all expecting a really special experience and the finest of food. It couldn't have been further from it. So sad.",2,2018,09,01
119,WOW factor ,"We stayed for one night as a surprise for my wife on our anniversary 

To say she was blown away is an understatement 

First impression sty’s with to till you leave such an amazing change from a normal hotel for no extra money 

The drinks a little steep £11.00 for a G&T with a Vodka Coke total £20.00 and if they serve you at the table they will try a £2.60 service charge which is a bit cheeky but refused to pay that and it was removed no problem 

If you’re looking for something different this won’t disappoint 

Many bistro and bars in 400 yards so not tied to the Yacht either

We will definitely do this again ",5,2018,09,01
119,Excellent hotel in a great location for the Excel,This was our second time staying at the Sunborn and we will definitely be back. It's my little bit of luxury whilst staying in London. I can't speak highly enough of this yatch. From the excellent staff to the fabulously clean rooms it gets a massive A* rating from us. Thank you Sunborn you make our stay perfect.,5,2018,09,01
119,Engagement trip,"On the approach to the yacht your taken back by its beauty! We were welcomed into reception and as we arrived early we checked in our luggage and advised it would be put into our room for us after 3pm. My partner had also emailed ahead and told sunburn we were getting engaged the day before our arrival and asked for a complimentary something to be added to our room, but was told was a £45 charge for petals and Champaign! Returned at 5pm to collect key and observed another couple checking in and being given a free complimentary upgrade as they were celebrating their anniversary. We then went to our room to discover no luggage had been delivered, and had to call reception to ask for it. Had to then explain to a Bell boy what our luggage looked like as it had not been labelled by reception correctly. 
Room is lovely, facilities in room are good, super large towels are really soft. Bed super comfy but pillows were all stained with make-up. 
On our first morning we sat on deck and ordered teas, which after 15 mins didn’t arrive, when checked where our order was the barman said “oh I havent made them yet”. so cancelled our order and bought teas from local Starbucks which had a better service. 
On check out we were not asked how our stay was so didn’t give feedback on site. This is not a 5* hotel as the service is shocking for the price you pay. ",3,2018,08,31
119,Made a nice change from the norm!,"A few twists and turns 2 tubes and DLR the hotel is located right next to the Excel, check in is quick, Exec rooms large (a river facing room a must).

Breakfast ordered via room service tablet was good but some items ordered we were told were not available when the food arrived.

Heating across hotel has some issues, note left in the room said it was being repaired.

For the price think the hotel is a little stingy on complimentary items (one bottle of water in the minibar) and the hotel bar week days closes at 12pm which following an evening in the city was disappointing for those wanting a final night cap.

Overall nice hotel and certainly a change from the norm... but given its remote location thought the hotel would have had more to do on board.

Note: 10-15min walk from hotel to O2 cable cars... flash your tube ticket for discounted rates.",4,2018,08,31
119,Appalling service!,"I wanted to write this review to share our terrible experience on the sunborn with others. I was so excited to book this for my partner’s birthday, based on the website and the other reviews on here I felt confident it would be fantastic. The whole experience was disastrous from start to finish. We stayed on the sunborn on one of the hottest days in July. The aircon in our room and throughout the whole boat wasn’t working and this wasn’t fixed throughout the duration of our overnight stay leaving all guests absolutely baking. We were unable to sleep it was so bad! 

We visited the restaurant for an evening meal and were told that no one was allowed to sit outside, despite the deck being completely empty and all guests being so hot. In the end they relented as one couple had already moved outside. Our waitress was very rude when I asked a second time to move and said ‘well it’ll mean I have to reset your table’. Not the standard of service I’d expect from a 4 star yacht. The food was average at best and in my opinion, overpriced! 

Top deck and bar were closed and apparently rarely open any more (according to staff) so if you are hoping to have lunch or drinks on the top deck, as advertised on the website, then think again. As a result we were left having to try and find an alternative lunch venue around the docklands.

We had multiple problems with equipment in our room. The worst thing about the whole stay was that the staff did not care AT ALL! Most of them were not able to speak very good english and therefore didn’t properly understand what we were asking them. They were poorly trained, with one lady on reception not even knowing where the lift was. 

Considering it was my partner’s birthday we left feeling that no one really cared whether we’d had a nice time. And that everything about the place was designed to make money, they even forgot the candle in the birthday dessert I’d asked for. Really poor and I will not be returning!",1,2018,08,29
119,Would definately recommend,"Booked this for our wedding anniversary and can honestly say best decision ever. 

Read the reviews before we went and I'm happy that on this occasion I didn't listen to the negative ones. 

Spent one night which included Sunday movie and the romantic package. The romantic package included rose petals in the room with chocolate, and a three course dinner with a glass of champagne. Dinner was well presented and tasted great. I had the sea bass and my husband had the steak with steam veg. Simply but tasty. Kibesh the gentleman that attended to us during our dinner, was very pleasant and attentive. Even though he was also attending to other guests, he somehow managed to make us feel as though it was just us he was catering to. 

We had a buffet style breakfast in the morning and even though it was a buffet you still received first class service from the staff who made sure you were well catered for. 

Our room was great with a very large port hole/window. Nice waking up to such a beautiful view of the river. The room was also a decent size. Bigger than what I expected. Very clean as well.

The interior décor of the hotel was also very beautiful and elegant.

The location of the hotel wasn't bad as when we left we walked for 5 mins to the Emirates cable car station and went over to Greenwich where we got a train home.

Overall we would recommend and definitely stay here again.",5,2018,08,29
119,"Great stay, but...",Great stay in a great and slightly different hotel. All staff we encountered were very polite and helpful. But there were a couple of things that let it down. The carpets in the communal areas need looking at. Looking old and tired which is a shame on such a stunning boat. And I found the evening food to be mediocre at best. I would defiantly return on a B&B basis and go into London for dinner. ,4,2018,08,28
119,Great weekend,"We stayed at Sunborn for a friends birthday weekend.
The accommodation was first class with a huge room overlooking the water.
the service was first rate as was the overall standard of the yacht.
The location is an easy walk fro Custom House DLR station and very close to the Excel centre.
also there are many bars and restaurants in close proximity. i would recommend Tapa Tapa which is opposite Sunbon up the stairs. it has a great atmosphere with excellent food.
also DLR is a great way to get around and if you are attending a concert at the O2 arena thee is the cable car which is £7 return if you use an oyster card. (if you are going to a concert please check what time the last cable car is a sit may be earlier than the concert finish)",5,2018,08,28
119,Fantastic,Stayed on the boat for 1 night. We were early to check into the room so they looked after our bag for us. The room was spacious and very clean. The bed was so comfy we both slept like a log. We had 2 drinks in the bar which cost £12 which is normal for London prices. We didn’t have breakfast as it cost £19.50 each for a full English which I though was overpriced!! Would stay here again.,5,2018,08,28
119,2nd visit. A little disappointed this time,"This was our second visit. As a hotel it’s unique and overall worth staying, I would book a river view room as for me that’s part of the charm. A few things disappointed this time though. 
We stayed 2 nights on a bed, dinner and breakfast deal. The first night we asked for the bill, for the drinks and sides which weren’t included, but were presented with a bill for the whole meal. 
The second night (Sunday) the menu was much  reduced in terms of choice. Not a big deal but of the two vegetarian options available on the previous night only one was available. Unfortunately for me, it was the same as I’d had the previous night and portion sizes definitely smaller.
After dinner we went to the bar for a drink. We selected gin which stated came with specific garnish and brand of tonic.  Unfortunately when they came this wasn’t the case, different garnish and a cheaper tonic. At £14 a drink we decided this wasn’t acceptable but was met with much rudeness from the bar man when we complained. His response, ‘we’ve no garnish left and I don’t order the tonic’. He then proceeded to carry on serving another customer! The manager did come and refunded the cost of the drinks but it wouldn’t have taken much to come and tell us in the first place, especially when a 12.5% tip is already added! That in itself when we had to go to the bar as to order, despite being told someone would take our order. After 10 minutes of waiting we decided no-one was coming.
Breakfast is nice but again as a vegetarian there wasn’t much choice. I had to ask for veggie sausages to be made. It’s typical of a lot of hotels but I still find it disappointing.",4,2018,08,27
119,One night stay,"We stayed for one night on this hotel boat and it was a great stay 
The room was spacious and clean and the restaurant was nice albeit quite pricey

I would recommend this hotel as access to London is great with the emirates cable car close to the O2 and from there you can take the boat up the Thames if you want

Would recommend",5,2018,08,27
119,"Fabulous ""AGAIN""",After yet another muck up from booking.com I would like to commend the reception staff at the sunborn Yacht Hotel in London for their excellence in solving it I absolutely love this hotel there is nothing I could say bad about it we had a free room upgrade which was much appreciated bearing in mind it was not their mistake it was booking.com but it was rectified by the young lad on the reception desk I took two other friends with myself and my wife this time I may have both said how wonderful they thought it was too and would be rebooking for their next visit to London. Thank you once again for the great service we have received this weekend and I look forward to seeing you again soon . Mr. John cooper and Mr. Simon Manley ,5,2018,08,26
119,2 night stay,Lovely hotel arrived late on the first evening and was alone. Reception staff were not very helpful then took 35minutes for a gin and tonic. 2nd day staff were fantastic. Both rooms were great first night floor5 2nd night floor 1 river view. Easy to get to the O2. Will go again if arriving after 6pm worth letting them know arrival time.,4,2018,08,25
119,OVERBOOKED??,"Booked a birthday treat for the wife 10 months in advance and paid in full for a night at the Sunborn Yacht Hotel. Received a call from the Sales Manager 4 weeks prior to departure informing us that the room had been re-allocated.  How can that happen? why such late notice? Surely a breach of contract??

Extremely poor customer experience - still waiting for the refund ...",1,2018,08,24
119,Honey moon getaway,"I booked this as a surprise for my wife as due to illness we had to return home from our honeymoon early. Even tough the stay and room was perfect (I had booked an executive riverview room) there was no free upgrade as stated on your website and rooms were available as I had checked whilst being here. We got ready for dinner and went down to the restaurant that was completely empty to be told it was fully booked? We went elsewhere for food but when returning the restaurant was still pretty much empty with only a few tables taken. We wasn’t told about booking a table and the website isn’t very clear either as to where to reserve a table. Was pretty gutted to be honest as in the notes I did mention it was a last minute honeymoon getaway and if anything could be done like a bottle of wine in room, so the least that could of been done was a reserved table but nope there was nothing. Would possibly stay again however there is room for improvement especially service.",2,2018,08,24
119,I love this place.,"Great venue! 

I’ve stayed here as a quest before and have come back for the great venue, for a well earned gin after a day out with the family. 
I’m currently sat on the sun deck chilling.
The staff are very friendly and will do anything they can to assist you.

Come here, you won’t be disappointed.",5,2018,08,23
119,"Comfy Bed, Super Clean but Poor Service","We stayed at Sunborn for 1 night, which was a gift for my girlfriends 30th birthday from her freinds. We had a great time but my only complaint would be the service on board was poor.

When we arrived we was informed we had been upgraded, which they do as standard if rooms are free. Its a nice touch, but meant we traded in a river view for a dockside view, given we was only there for the one night, we would have probably preferred to keep the river view, but you can't really moan at an upgrade!!

We went to the bar, and whilst at the bar waiting to be served a waiter told us to sit down look over the drinks menu and he would come and take our order - all very good. We preceded to wait 15 minutes at our table, whilst both other tables and people at the bar were served before us. Whilst 3 servers where stood around doing nothing (and often making eye contact with us). We ended up leaving and heading to a nearby restaurant instead.

Whilst we didn't have a drink or eat dinner on board, one note would be everything is very expensive. We had breakfast in the morning and the food was nice, so can only assume dinner would be as well.

The rooms are nice, spacious and the one big comment would be how comfy the bed is!! Had a brilliant nights sleep.

On checkout we again experienced a relatively poor attitude from reception, we had some confusion over the fact our breakfast had been pre-paid on the booking, thankfully it was sorted there rather than having to call in the future for a refund.

Overall a nice hotel, and a novelty factor with it being a yacht. We had a great time. But given what i am sure is a very expensive nightly rate, i would expect the customer service to be fantastic, and all our experiences with staff were poor.",3,2018,08,21
119,A hotel with a difference a lovely experience,"A truly wonderful birthday treat and a chance to stay on a very luxurious super yacht in a large and well appointment sea view cabin without the bother of sea sickness !! Also a fabulous opportunity to see a part of London I am not familiar with and I was very pleasantly surprised. Lots to do in the area and the hop on hop off water taxi ,very like Venice was a fabulous way to head into the centre of London along the river instead of the usual public transport. The only negative was the restricted menu and the quality of the food served which was just like average bar food in a local pub. The à la carte menu was for some reason not available and they ran out of some courses and wines early in the evening, the service was also very slow. Otherwise a fantastic experience.
",4,2018,08,21
119,Perfect 😊,"My partner treated me to a night away for my birthday and I honestly couldn't have asked for anything more.
Great location. Lovely views in the evening. Staff extremely friendly and helpful, especially Nicos in the bar! Top service and cocktails, always smiling.. a credit to your team. Room was amazing, thank you for the free upgrade!
A huge thank you to Raygan and Gintare who gave us the most amazing spa treatments. Amazing ladies who really made our night and truly are superstars.
Thank you Sunborn. We will definitely be back!! 
Viki and Terry 😊",5,2018,08,20
119,Could do better,"Visited in August with my wife and grandaughter 6 year old. I had booked a river view room with balcony which was spacious and with a tiny balcony. So small was the balcony that you could not pass another person whio was sitting. Bathroom was very dated, however main cabin of a good standard. Food, we ate evening meals and breakfast. Meals were very average and quite expensive when you add 12.5% service charge.

The public areas amounted to the reception / restaraunt/ bar with a small deck outside. We have been fortunate to use 5 star cruise lines around the world and did not consider this yacht to be of a similar standard, particularly food.

Good location if you are visiting O2 or  Excel. Staff quite friendly and the yacht was very clean.

One tip if you are using the Tube and contactless cards, the DLR at Customs House for Excel does not have barriers to exit. You have to fine a pay point and swipe your card. Sadly we were unaware and were charged a full days fare on the Tube which was my fault.

In conclusion the yacht promised a lot but in my opinion fell short of that 5 star experience.",3,2018,08,20
119,A large comfortable ship in Victoria Dock,"A little different to a normal hotel stay.Rooms spacious and comfortable.Food pleasing,but limited.Rather a distance from central London but this can be reached by river (45 mins) or train.Most convenient for Excel.Well worth a try ,it is fairly expensive for river view.Staff most pleasant.
Plenty of plane noise from City Airport in the morning",5,2018,08,20
119,A well deserved one night break,Thanks to Groupon I experience an amazing stay..the yacht was lush..the view breath taking.we had good food good wine and a lovely day celebrating our Anniversary..the rooms superb I would like to visit again but funds not available..,4,2018,08,20
119,"Lovely, different stay in London","My stay this weekend in London was a 60th birthday present from my son and daughter in law.
I had heard of Sunborn before but never stayed on any of the yachts.
It’s about 20-30 mins away from the centre of London by the DLR and tube.
One of the things that we liked about the location was the view of the river and a lovely area that was different from any other we had stayed in London before.
A very warm welcome by reception staff, our rooms were ready.
Lovely spacious cabin, everything you need for a comfy stay.
The bed was exceptionally comfy, slept very well.

The yacht itself is immaculately kept, we had a port side cabin.
The bars, dining room and decks are kept very well, immaculate.

We are out but all commented on the great value of the menu, if we stayed here again we would eat at the yacht.

All in all our stay was a very nice, different but lovely stay.
I would not hesitate to book again, the hotel is fabulous for O2 concerts or the Excel.
I would highly recommend it.",5,2018,08,20
119,Excellent accommodation,"Stayed here on a business trip - nothing on at Excel - so got a great deal. Rooms (or cabins) are very well appointed - even had a balcony,

Location great if you have business in east side of city - close to DLR

No chance of sea sickness either!",4,2018,08,19
119,London trip,Very disappointing!!! Nice spacious rooms but the hotel is run by staff who have poor English. Was promised an upgrade as found cheaper booking through trip advisor but this did not happen. The room has a tablet for all the information on the hotel including room service etc but this did not work and room had no back up. The place has no atmosphere. Went to sit out on the rear of the boat for a cocktail which was £11.00 more expensive than city prices and it was serviced by a very young barman who didn’t even know how to make a Margarita and  served with a dry piece of lime. Maid didn’t top up the tea for the morning. Rang to ask for some to be delivered for the morning but never got it. Really poor service all round.,1,2018,08,19
119,Could be better,"We stayed here for one night to celebrate our anniversary. On first impression the yacht was much bigger than I expected and the reception/layout seemed very good. We were placed on level -1 with a river view but only had a port hole which I wasn’t really expecting. 

The bedding was very comfy but the bed was made up of 2 mattresses pushed together which seemed strange in an upmarket hotel. The TV is also in an odd position making viewing from bed difficult. 

I found the drinks on board expensive at around £12 for a cocktail and not a big enough choice of drinks. The breakfast at £20 although a lot of money was a good choice of food with quality ingredients.

Not the best of surrounding areas if you fancy a few drinks, there is a couple of small restaurants and one bar which had no music playing. 

Glad I’ve stayed here to tick off list but wouldn’t return to this area again.",3,2018,08,19
119,Anniversary visit,"We were really looking forward to the Sunborn, we booked via Secret Escapes on a one night dinner b&b break. We were disappointed really. The yacht seemed very dated inside, almost 80s inspired decor. The cabin itself was large and the bed comfortable, everything was clean and tidy. The big disappointment was the dinner, it was awful. We had pork belly which was just fat. The crackling on the side was inedible totally. Certainally not the luxury meal we anticipated, we ended up leaving it and eating in a nearby tapas place which was very good. Would we stay there again? No. Much better places in London.",3,2018,08,19
119,Stunning hotel,"Our first time here and have to say that this hotel is superb!
We stayed in a executive king room with river view, and was not dissapointed. Very very clean and lovely comfortable bed!.
The it thing I would say is be prepared to spend money if you decide to drink in the bar as cocktails are around £11.50 each and not forgetting the service charge added after aswell, but hey this is line in and them prices are not out of the normal. But all in all for a nice quite relaxing stay you can't go wrong.",5,2018,08,19
119,Welcome aboard,"Had a one night stay at the Sunborn to see Mario Biondi at the indigo O2 . Great watching sunset on bar deck.
Shame it didn’t cast off and drop us off at Brighton Marina where we live, unfortunately had to throw ourselves to the mercy of M25",5,2018,08,18
119,would highly recommend,"Family trip and my girls had the best time ever. All was perfect, Staff were fantastic, rooms were spacious and so comfortable and cozy. Location perfect for Excel, will return here every year!  Loved it 👍🏼",5,2018,08,18
119,ideal for a special occasion,"stayed here this week for an overnight, it was husbands 50th and we had friends down from up north who wanted to see London, the Sunborn was amazing very friendly staff, checked in earlier as one room out of the 2 was available so we could drop bags off, we had booked the set menu option n the restaurant, quite a basic menu with about 6 choices, one was fish but was not available that evening!! but the food was lovey and for £29.95 you couldn't go wrong !! drink quite expensive though. the sundeck bar was not open though. the room was huge and the bed very comfy, complimentary tea and coffee supplied - would highly recommend this hotel ",5,2018,08,17
119,Anniversary ,I booked this for my husband and I .from start to finish loved it .very smart indeed staff very polite and friendly room clean and huge tv kettle water complimentary views stunning will definitely come back we orderd breakfast in our room £4 charge but I’d advise going to buffet as it was cold and so was the coffee mentioned to reception they were gr8 and refunded the £4 charge dinner has to be pre booked I had friends come visit but we ate out prices are the same weather eating in or  out drinks quite dear anyway had a gr8 stay and reception said next time call and they will give us a deal I’d love to have river view with balcony next time ill be back ❤️ ,4,2018,08,17
119,A real treat,I booked an overnight as a thank you to my husband.  We thoroughly enjoyed our stay.  When we arrived we had a couple of cocktails and a sharing platter in the bar area which was extremely tasty.  Our evening meal was from a set menu which I think must be all they do on a Sunday evening.  The food was delicious and the scallops from the specials list were the best I have tasted.  The room was very spacious and 10 out of 10 for cleanliness.  I can wait to go back.  ,4,2018,08,17
119,Something different and an enjoyable stay,"Stayed for 3 nights to celebrate a special birthday, and the stunning yacht certainly lends itself to a sense of occasion and celebration.

Rooms were spacious and nice and clean. The bar was nice sitting and enjoying a drink, although some shade from the summer sun would have been nice during the recent heatwave. 

Breakfast was good value at £19.50 per adult (children free), and the staff were all helpful and efficient.

Probably only criticism would be that some of the carpets are quite worn and loose - indeed one of the waiters tripped over a bump in the carpet. Other than that though a good stay at the price we paid, and I'm sure we'll come back.",4,2018,08,17
119,Luxury stay,"We stayed on the yacht as a special birthday treat. Even though it had a special luxury feel, it was also relaxed and friendly.  The location was great, just a few minutes walk from the Emirates gondola across to the o2",5,2018,08,16
119,Outstanding!,"Thoroughly enjoyed our Stay, Ideal for Anniversary Celebrations. Staff were incredibly professional and courteous.  Complimentary Bathrobe and Slippers waiting for you in the Wardrobe upon arrival, which you can choose to purchase upon departure!  Room spotless, Breakfast £19.50 pp, we opted for Continental at £14.50, it was delicious, but there are other options too. There is a DLR nearby for  transport into London, but you can also get an Uber! Nearby Tesco Express, and Starbucks, plus other establishments to eat if you don't want to eat at the yacht.",5,2018,08,15
119,Great yacht. Great location.,"Booked the Sunborn for a family night in London.  Set in an enviable position with views over London. Great fun hotel, friendly staff. Had a room with a balcony which was novel. Lots of action in the dock with various water sports etc.  Good restaurants within 10 min stroll. Highly recommended for a fun night in London.",5,2018,08,14
119,"Friendly , great of front of house but food quality is poor ",Nice hotel and great staff but I would eat elsewhere if going again .. the ingredients for the food in the restaurant on the set menu are of a poor quality in my opinion .. front of house excellent . Views from the bar towards Canary Wharf are amazing .,4,2018,08,14
119,Excellent weekend,My wife surprised me with a stay here for my birthday and it was absolty superb. The rooms were very clean and bigger than we thought. We booked the lanes end resturant and the food was amazing. ASwell as the breakfast which was very nice. We will definatly going back. The veiw over the London skyline is awesome aswell highly recommend this place. Don't think about it. Just book it,5,2018,08,13
119,AVERAGE,"I’ve been here with my boyfriend for his birthday. I was so excited and Robert at the reception was so professional. We’ve been to the bar for aperitivo and the atmosphere was really chill and nice. I booked a packages 1 night stay + dinner. I’m really happy about the hotel experience, but not about the dinner. The steak was gristly and in the dessert I found an unidentified object in it. When I make a complaint with the supervisor he told me that: you order from the set menu what you pretend. So he just destroyed my romantic dinner and I went outside to eat something else. Next day I done a complaint in the reception and I spoke with the assistant f&b, he was nice and polite. In the end they gave to me a discount and offer an afternoon tea. I hope you will improve your food and training your staff to handle a complaint",3,2018,08,13
119,Hotel with a difference.,"I booked this hotel on a whim for the night before I went to France as thought it would be easier staying in London to catch the eurostar. I travelled to it from st Pancras, I seemed to go a long route following the hotels recommendation, The best route I found on the way home was DLR to Bank then Northern line to St Pancras. 
The hotel staff were very nice and prfessional, I was given a free upgrade to an executive room with a river view. This was excellent with stunning views at night into London. the room is a little noisy with planes if you have to doors open onto the balcony, but when closed i was not disturbed at all. The air con is a little noisy but not too bad. Food was excellent and amazing value for money two courses for £19.00 I will come back to the hotel again.",5,2018,08,12
119,Lovely treat,"My husband and I booked to stay onboard the Sunborn at the last minute for our 10th Anniversary. Upon arrival we were made very welcome by the reception staff and given tokens for complimentary drinks in the bar, once we had settled in. The room was lovely, spacious and very clean. 
In the evening we ventured out for something to eat, rather than stay onboard. It seemed only right that we should see some of the sights given the central location. 
The following morning we enjoyed a full English breakfast. However, the dinning room was quite cramped and not quite so relaxed, which made you feel as though you needed to rush. 
In addition there is quite a lot of air traffic that flies low level across this part of the city. However, this didn’t bother us and certainly did not detract from the magic of our stay. ",4,2018,08,11
119,Treatment & Afternoon Tea Only,"I was happy to have this opportunity via WOWCHER it was worth the price, I was happy with the treatment & afternoon tea though it was annoying that my friend & I could not be in the same room together to have the treatments which is quite poor because it is supposed to be a quaint experience.

The English woman who gave my friend the treatment was just completely miserable & seemed completely uninterested in what she was doing, there was no happiness or even a fake smile while the other European lady was pleasant on the whole.

Overall it was good, the staff who served us the Tea & Champagne were very nice & the emails prior were answered within a few hrs.

I cannot comment on the room etc but trust me the view is not the best & its in an awkward part of the city surrounded by Lego Land New Flats and cranes but that most of London these days.",4,2018,08,11
119,Interesting ,"Spent just the one night at this hotel a in Excel in London
The room was very well presented & prepared 
In the Lands End restaurant there wasn’t a lot of choice and hence disappointing 
Thought the a A la Cart menu is only available at weekends again disappointing.
Breakfast was good 
My only grief was that with checking out at 11 my sleep was interrupted by a person who didn’t knock but came straight in!!
Complained to reception who said they would look into it and come back to me !!
That was Tuesday today Friday still no response 
Overall interesting but expensive for what it is..
I will not be returning 
",3,2018,08,10
119,Amazing!,"The location was incredible, the staff were more than helpful and friendly and the facilities were fantastic! We were given a complimentary upgrade of our room which really made our trip and the food/drinks were brilliant. ",5,2018,08,10
119,Very good hotel,"My wife and I have just spent one night here and found it to be a very good hotel. On arrival we were surprised to get an upgrade to our booked room. This was apparently as a ‘thank you ‘ for booking directly with the hotel instead of through a third party. 
The room was large with a balcony and the king size bed was very comfortable. The staff were very polite and attentive.we didn’t eat at the hotel and so can’t comment on the quality of the food or restaurant facilities. 
The hotel is a mile or so away from London City airport and as such there’s quite a bit of air traffic in the area but the room was very well sound proofed and so we hardly noticed the aircraft when we were inside. 
As an aside, for those who may fancy getting to the hotel by transport other than the DLR (Custom house being the closest DLR station) I can highly recommend getting the Thames Clipper from central London. Disembark at North Greenwich and then get the Emirates Air cable car across to Victoria Dock (the hotel is a 10 minute walk from there). The views of the city from the river and then from the cable car are fantastic. 
All in all an enjoyable stay and a place I would recommend. ",4,2018,08,09
119,Couldn't ask for more,"I love this hotel.  Summer prices in London are creeping up so it is well worth staying a little further out and when I did, I came across this gem of a hotel.  I was there on business but it felt like a holiday.  Staff were excellent, plenty around and about and there's no better way to end the day with a cold beer on the deck.
I used to work on cruise ships so it brought back some nice memories too.  
I've booked again already",5,2018,08,09
119,Birthday Treat,"Fantastic hotel. Super staff who arranged balloons, wine and super room. Fab food and lots of places nearby too - we did ‘Up at the O2’ on route via the Emirates cable cars - perfect. 
I couldn’t recommend this enough. ",5,2018,08,09
119,What a Fab place,"I booked the Sunborn for my mums birthday - myself my husband and my parents all went. It was lovely.
I don’t think you can beat London in the sunshine so having cocktails on the deck overlooking the wind surfers and paddle boarders together with a back drop of the O2 was fabulous!
The rooms were spacious and beautifully clean with all the amenities you needed - almost didn’t feel like you were on a boat.
We had dinner which was delicious - the pork belly in particular was lovely! And we finished off the evening with a glass of prosecco on the deck over looking the lights of London!
Can’t wait to go back!",5,2018,08,09
119,An amazing concept for a floating Hotel,"This is what most people would class as pure indulgence. A cabin on board a luxury yacht which was all that we hoped for and more. It's location is great next to the excell
On Victoria Dock wit bars restaurants in the immediate area.  We will be going back when we can . Tip look out for their offers ! .we are lunch on board which was excellent.",5,2018,08,08
119,Wynne,Fabulous hotel and stayed in a superb river view suite. Excellent food in the restaurants . Both bars have an outside terrace overlooking the river. Service and drinks were excellent. Would definitely recommend if you want a hotel with a difference!,5,2018,08,07
119,Pretty dire overall. Room was good but everything else left a lot to be desired.,"We checked in at 7pm. Cabin was great, in fact it felt like we were off on holiday...but our focus was soon on leaving the boat given a) we were told there were no tables we could book at any time for dinner and b) we tried for a drink in the champagne bar and it was ‘closed to photograph fake proposals’ for promotions.  So we tried the main bar... where we were chased to pay a bill before we even ordered a thing. So we left. Dinner at tapa tapa was great across the street.... and so later we returned with a last ditched attempt to get the boat to redeem itself... well we waited in the bar for service, eventually tried to order at the bar to be told by the barman he couldn’t take orders... 10 minutes later we did get table service and spent £30 after the additional 12.5% service for 2 nice drinks... woohoo! Overall, maybe a great place if you’re happy to splash the cash and not care about getting what you pay for. Personally, the Good Hotel down the dock (a social enterprise) will get my vote, and my pounds every time!",1,2018,08,07
119,Superb service,"All the staff were very polite and courteous 
Rooms very good a lot bigger than I thought apart from bathroom but very clean and serviceable 
Food very good and great value for money
Bar prices very much like all hotels so we were happy to drink on the decks and enjoy the view
Will definitely return",5,2018,08,06
119,Bithday Weekend,"I took my wife having been recommended a stay aboard the Sunborn as a treat. It lived up to expectations and more. some very good deals if you book direct and the food is exceptional.
All staff are there to help and ensure you have a memorable stay of which we did",5,2018,08,06
119,Beautiful Yacht!,"Wanted somewhere different to stay when going to London.
We've always fancied the Sunborn so booked a room the day before traveling. 
We were on the lower deck for just over £250 pounds, but it was perfect for us...we could see the water just outside the window which we loved. 
The service is friendly and the bar team made us long islands which they dont have on the menu. 
Great way to finish the day with some nice fresh sharing boards in the bar.
Lovely room.
Good staff.
Tube station 3 minutes walk away...glad we gave it a go! :)",5,2018,08,06
119,Best nights sleep for a long time,"From the first view you get of this Hotel it's amazing. The Check in was quick and easy and we were given an upgrade to a room with a balcony. The room was really well equipped and a good size with a seperate area to sit and watch the television. One of the most impressive things was how quiet it was in the room. The doors to the room and the bathroom are big and heavy but despite this you do not hear any other doors banging and closing, no sounds of occupants in the rooms above and below and incredibly once in the room with the doors closed despite being under the flight path to City Airport I didnt hear the planes. The bed was huge and so comfortable and despite the heat wave which the UK was in the middle of during our stay the room was just the right temperature without the annoying whirring of the air conditioning. The Hotel is ideally located for the Emirates Cable car and is only a short walk from the DLR station at Cusom House. The only disappointing thing is the price of Breakfast which we did not have due to the cost. Superb Hotel would certainly stay again.",5,2018,08,06
119,Will come back again,"After a full day scouting the city we came back to a beautiful room with fantastic views of the docks. We had room service which was quick hot and efficient.  
Breakfast in the morning was on the terrace with the sun shining. Keep up the good work we will be sure to visit again. Friendly staff happy stay.",5,2018,08,04
119,Lovely,Stayed here for one night with my wife and it was amazing. Stunning hotel and such a fabulous setting. Wished we was there longer and will definitely be returning. Breakfast was lovely. Room was immaculate. We had a Exec River view and would recommend anyone to having it. Staff were polite and welcoming. No complaints from the either of us. Thank you for a lovely night.,5,2018,08,04
119,Nice hotel with a difference ,"Stayed one night in a dock facing executive room which was a free upgrade on checking in. It’s cooler on the dock side as the sun does not shine directly on this and on the day we stayed it was 30 centigrade. The air conditioner did struggle to get the room temperature down at best it went down to 23 in the room.
Room was large and comfortable with nice furniture giving a nautical feel. Bathroom again was of a good size and more than adequate. Could not use the champagne bar on the roof as no shade and heat was unbearable in the current heatwave, the downstairs bar was good, no daught beers but bottles of peroni etc for £5 were fine. We did not eat at the restaurant as we wanted to try the tapas bar opposite which was excellent and to the right of the large pub called the fox. The sun born restaurant seemed very well priced at 2 course for £19.99 or £25 for 3. All the staff were really helpful and very pleasant.",5,2018,08,04
119,Something different,"I stayed here for one night as my partner was participating in the London ride 100, We had our baby son with us too. The yacht itself is pretty big and impressive, the only hotel of its kind in the country so was definitely something different. We stayed in a standard room with dock view and it was very spacious. Wooden floor and furniture in the rooms and a huge king size bed that had plenty of room for all 3 of us. The thing that let it down was the bathroom, it wasn’t very big, a little cramped actually and the tiling wasn’t brilliant. That probably sounds like I’m being very picky but when something is advertised as being luxury your expectations rise somewhat. Other than that the Sunborn hotel was very nice. The staff were friendly and the place was nice and clean and right next to the excel. We would like to stay again in the future.",4,2018,08,04
119,50th Birthday Trip,"I cannot fault this fabulous hotel. It might be a little further out of London but it is well worth the extra time. it is quirky, staff are attentive it is just wonderful. Rooms are excellent and other than room service trays being left in the corridors a little too long everything was perfect. Would 100% recommend. Was hoping for an upgrade but wasn't fortunate enough to receive one.",5,2018,08,03
119,Great place to stay,"I stayed at the Sunborn Yacht Hotel earlier this week. I needed somewhere to stay in London at short notice and found they had availability at a very reasonable rate. It is the third time I have stayed here and I would certainly recommend it. It is quite expensive to eat there, but the food is excellent.",5,2018,08,03
119,Great rooms and location; service non-existent,"If you are enticed here by the champagne bar on the website then prepare for disappointment.  It was closed and then opened but no staff. I put my own chair out and then others asked me to help them.  I suspect that some of the girls were working and even offered a gent to take his picture for money!!

Food is a disaster and wine is rank and over priced.

Staff were very understanding.  They recognise the hotel could be good but no management.",1,2018,08,02
119,Amazing location and atmosphere,"I invited my friends for my birthday here and it was an awesome experience, the personal was very close to our needs, especially Narcis who welcomed me with a cocktail for my birthday and constantly asking if he can do more for us. I recommend this from the bottom of my heart. I will certanly visit them with the first ocasion that comes in my way.",5,2018,08,02
119,Excellent stay,"From check in to check out everything was enjoyable. We received an upgrade to our room which was much appreciated. Very good food, well cooked and full of flavour with great service. Room was much bigger than expected with plenty of storage space. All the staff we encountered were very polite and friendly and helpful. Look forward to returning at some point.",5,2018,07,31
119,what an amazing hotel!!!,"We stayed here for a night July. The boat is massive! The reception area looks like a luxury cruise ship, which is what it kind of is ! The bar is fine a nice outdoor part but it was too windy to sit out. The room has a queen size bed and a few chairs, a good size bathroom and plenty of wardrobe space. The bed is so comfortable! And air-con and heating to adjust the temperature to suit you. We really enjoyed our stay!",5,2018,07,30
119,"Different Experience, just service to improve","Stayed for one night with my son to celebrate my birthday and then pop over to the 02 for the boxing. Its definitely a different experience and I would recommend it. The only issues I have is the dining room (too small) and general staffing levels. We had booked lunch, and I had telephoned forward to warn we were delayed by 20 minutes. Reception were great and efficient. We went up to the restaurant and they just looked confused! Stood around awkwardly and after a few discussions we were shown to a table in the corner with the explanation there were some large parties in (must have surprised them)?Lunch was great but over a £100 for two.We tried to have an early evening drink before the boxing but waited that long (table service only) we told them to cancel the order. The bar was busy with a large party with just one person making the drinks and two serving.

Breakfast was the big disappointment.We asked at reception if we needed to book as we had now seen the size of the dining area and was told no. Breakfast from 7.00am to 11.00 am at weekends (very civilised). We arrived and found a table for two which just needed clearing but was told to go wait on the sofas. Around 10 mins later the table was ready, when I say ready, I mean when the coffee and tea arrived we had no cups lol. They had to replenish the food three times before I managed to get something hot, it just seemed as if it cannot cope. I did see a lady complain her table for 4 was not ready around 25 mins after they arrived. At £19.95 per person, should I expect better?",4,2018,07,30
119,Good but could be better,"Had just a one night stay on Sunborn as part of my wife's birthday celebrations.
Sunborn certainly offers a different experience and the boat itself is beautiful.
The rooms are surprisingly spacious, very comfortable, and well equiped. The food in the restaurant was very good and service excellent. Based on those elements alone, I would be giving the Sunborn a five-star rating however, there were other things that let it down.

Firstly, we had very much looked forward to a drink in the publicised champagne bar only to fingd that this had been taken over for a corporate event. That so annoys me when hotels do that without the courtesy of telling guests in advance of their stay.
Not to worry, we thought, the bar looks nice and indeed it was. Sadly the service in the bar was woefully lacking. When we were there it was late afternoon and so not overly busy but even so it took a long time to get served then, when we did, the waiter couldn't get the order right bringing back three drinks for two of us. We then tried to order nibbles to go with the drinks but of the three choices on the menu, the only two we would have liked were unavailable. Not big problems but very poor for a quality hotel. The wine choice is disappointing but at least drinks are not expensive for a London hotel.
Having had a lovely dinner that evening we were expecting a similar quality at breakfast. Sadly, this was not to be the case. It was busy when we arrived but there were free tables so presumably within capacity. There was a queue of people waiting for the hot food buffet to be replenished then when it was it ran out again with people still waiting and this went on for quite some time so breakfast was a somewhat long and drawn-out and far from relaxing process.

We would most certainlyconsider going back to the Sunborn when hopefully the champagne bar is open and the bar service sorted out.",4,2018,07,30
119,The Most Amazing Experience,"I do not know how to put into words how amazing the Sunborn Yacht is! I booked an Executive riverview room for a surprise for my husband as he graduated with a 1st. I emailed the hotel in the week to book dinner reservations and to ask advice on the hotel etc and the staff were very prompt at replying. 

On arrival the staff were so helpful and polite,they made us feel very welcome. 

We had room 4040 and as my husband walked into the room he could not believe his eyes and nor could i. We had the best room on the yacht with a suite, we had the front of the boat! Our room had a corner bath with a sauna and two showers. We were lost for words. We had the best night sleep. 

Before I arrived I had seen reviews about air conditioning and how it was hot but we had to turn our air conditioning off at one point because the room was cool enough. It was perfect. 

Dinner was also amazing and it was so nice to experience dinner on a yacht. The interior is amazing and its different from your normal hotel. We then sat outside in the bar area looking out to London while drinking cocktails. 

The next morning we ordered room service breakfast because we wanted a relaxing morning. It was delivered very prompt and it was so amazing having a morning in the room just enjoying the views and each others company. We then sunbathed on our balcony/front of the boat until it was time to check out. 

It will be a experience and memory that we will never forget. Thank you to the staff for making our stay so amazing and for the upgrade.

119,Something a bit different,"Enjoyed an overnight dinner,bed and breakfast package to celebrate our wedding anniversary.The yacht looks impressive from both outside and inside,and has a different feel to that of a traditional hotel.Our room had a balcony overlooking the river so we were able to leave the door open at night to ease the heat problem,the room was very spacious and comfortable,and the bathroom was as you would expect in a cruise ship cabin.All the food we had on board was good,and the staff in the restaurant were pleasant and helpful.The drinks in the downstairs bar were quite pricey as was the wine at dinner,but probably no more than you would expect in a London hotel.We were lucky to have lovely weather,so could enjoy watching all the outdoor activity on the river,and nightfall over the London skyline.We enjoyed our stay and would consider returning to explore the area as there is so much to see and do within afew minutes of the hotel.",4,2018,07,28
119,"Second visit , we love it ","The sunburn is a great place to stay if you are visiting the o2 as you can get the cable car over the river in a matter of minutes . The service we received was very good and the rooms are clean and spacious. I’d recommend booking a river view room with a balcony . There is a terrace outside where you can have cocktails and look out over the river and see the o2 arena , planes travel over the river every ten minutes and they come really close so you can get a great picture of them . Breakfast is excellent. Check in and check out very smooth . Would definitely recommend ",4,2018,07,27
119,Disappointing,"This was my second visit on the Sunborn, as my first was very enjoyable, but this time it wasn't an enjoyable experience. 
Reception staff, on arrival, were helpful and informed us our room was ready apart from the extra bed which will be made shortly, we didn't mind as just wanted to drop off our bags and explore. 
We noticed how hot our room was but considering the heat wave we understood and put on the Aircon before we left. 
After a great and exhausting day in London we arrived back around 9pm to what could be described as a torrent of heat as we opened our door. We soon realised that the air con wasnt working sucnifficantly and our extra bed had not been made. 
I went to reception, were I noted my concerns and was told it will be sorted...fair enough. On returning to our room, two minutes later, we were met by a very grumpy lady who was starting to make up our extra bed. I asked if I could have an extra pillow which she abruptly answered 'no'. She did try to be helpful in other ways and eventually got us an extra pillow and quilt for my youngest to sleep on the floor as being 12 didn't want to share a bed . She also got us a fan as our room was not possible to sleep in. However she did all this in such a way we all felt very uncomfortable.
The sofa bed that was made up for us was rock hard there was no way you could sleep on it, it actually collapsed twice in the night. In the morning I was looking forward to a nice coffee but the machine didn't even work so we went for breakfast. 
On our arrival, another guest was in front of us waiting to be seated, he was asked his room number but he couldn't remember and didn't speak much English, the lady serving him was so rude and abrupt and even rolled her eyes at him behind his back. The breakfast was ok but not £20 per head ok. On leaving I even noticed the same member of staff and a colleague bickering with each other.",2,2018,07,27
119,Stay Away!,"Possibly the worst night at a hotel ever! Room temperature at 31.5 degrees as the air con was broken and had been for the last 24hrs. They failed to mention this at check in. Why? Surely it would have been much better service for your guests to advise at check in and offer the option of a refund if necessary.
Where were the duty managers? Who was leading the team and helping them to navigate this situation?
It seems to me they were burying their head in the sand and trying to carry on regardless. Whilst I admire the effort it’s a little tricky when your guests are expected to sleep in rooms with no opening windows, no ventilation and a room temperature in excess of 30 degrees. To top it all one guest even told me they were advised to visit the local Tesco as they’d asked for more water!! Seriously!
I checked out at 6am with no apology or acknowledgement of the issue! Unbelievable.
Your vision of “Creating memorable moments by delivering unique and special experiences that make guests want to come back and to share it with others” well you’ve certainly achieved most of this......only I don’t want to come back! 
Thanks for the special experience Sunborn London!",1,2018,07,26
119,"sweltering,","My husband surprised me with a 2 night stay at this hotel to celebrate our silver wedding anniversary
l. When I walked aboard the yacht it didn’t disappoint, it is beautifully appointed and our room( with a balcony) was also of very good standard,
However it immediately became obvious there was a problem. 
The room was so hot-29.3 c .
My husband couldnt get the phone to work so went to reception, to be told the air con throughout the yacht was broken, but they were working on it,
Over the next hour the room got even hotter, so we went back to ask if there was a cooler room.No- all rooms were the same we were told. Eventually we asked for a fan which was delivered but made little difference.
The night was worse- trying to sleep when the temperature was in the 30s was impossible .The next day ( our Silver Anniversary)there was still no air conditioning working so far from having a relaxing day, we decided it would be better to go out and find somewhere to sit that was air conditioned.
So we made little use of the room as it was just too hot to stay in!
My main complaint though was that the staff just kept saying the same thing, it’s broken we are trying to fix it.
When we left we complained again but were told all the hotel would do was refund our breakfast bill,
We have since discovered that other guests were given a full refund- but even though we told them this was a special occasion which had been a disaster, the most we were offered was a refund on breakfast.
This hotel is gorgeous but the staff seemed disinterested in making sure we were happy. I truly thought the least they would do was offer us a similar break on another occasion - when the air con is fixed!
It doesn’t matter how lovely the hotel is- if there is ambivalence by the staff about a serious problem, then the hotel is a failure,no matter how many stars it has",1,2018,07,26
119,Enjoyable Stay,"I booked this hotel due to it being out of the ordinary and it looked really nice.  It certainly didn't disappoint.  There was a mixup on arrival with the host stating that breakfast wasn't included but I had my invoice which stated it did.  After the first 2 nights and at no fault of the hotel, I asked to be moved due to the noisy people above our room.  This was not a problem at all and we were upgraded to a room with a balcony riverside.  Breakfast was delicious, we found a cheap place to eat around the corner for lunch and dinner and it was easy enough to get to the city and beyond.  The Emirates cable cars were a nice addition to staying down here as well and they take you right to the O2 Arena.  I would definately stay here again.",4,2018,07,26
119,Terrible,Was booked this hotel as a gift. When we arrived we was impressed with the hotel. However it soon became apparent that the air conditioning wasn't working and you can't open a window on the lower floors. The room was showing 31 degrees with no way of getting fresh air. Initially we was only offered a bottle of water and a 10 percent refund. But after saying this wasn't enough. They refunded the full amount. No offer to find us alternative accommodation and impossible to stay in those conditions we ended up on the streets of London at 10pm with nowhere to go. The Ibis next door was fully booked. No doubt with guests from the sunborn. We eventually found another hotel at the ibis shepards Bush. Which I am laying in at then moment having just had to turn the air conditioning down as its too cold. The excuses given was that the sunborn uses water to cool the air conditioning and the water in the Thames is warm. I find that hard to believe as I bet if I jumped in I wouldn't have found it that warm. I will be writing a letter directly complaining as I feel they should have found us somewhere else to stay. ,1,2018,07,26
119,If I could give this zero I would !,"Upon cHecking  in at 11.30pm we went to our room to find broken air conditioning and phones unable to call reception. A passing member of staff said it had been a problem since yesterday and nobody had come to fix it, not the story they are giving at reception. The room temperature was 30 degrees and with no opening windows this is not acceptable. The organisation had our email so why not let us know before arrival as we would certainly have not traveled across London to be inconvenienced in this way and would not have stayed. The staff on reception really could not be bothered and offering a refund was deemed a solution. The more senior manager seemed to find the whole situation amusing, with a grin on his face, which at midnight it was most certainly not . Why did they also not mention it at check in ?? We made them call other hotels to find us a room and pay the difference in accommodation fees . I am writing this at 1am and still extremely angry at the lack of customer service from the management and having to pay to stay at the crown plaza which is basically a glorified travel lodge . We had to ask for iced water at reception which seemed an inconvenience with staff reluctant as the bar was closing. I cannot tell you how angry I am. Whilst I appreciate problems happen, they had many opportunities to deal with this efficiently and clearly could not be bothered . We were among other people who were trying to find alternative accommodation with little success . I look forward to seeing the hotel response to this. IF it had been dealt with appropriately at the time, this review would have been quite different .",1,2018,07,25
119,Terrible customer service,"We arrived at 11.30pm after e-mailing to say we would be arriving late, we had chosen to stay here because of the quirky nature of the hotel and we were looking forward to it. 

When we arrived, the staff were sweating and it was very warm, but it’s a warm day. However when we got to our room, the air conditioning wasn’t working (this wouldn’t have been a problem, but the room had no window and the temperature was 29.5 degrees.) 

The phone in the room did not work, so we asked a worker in the corridor who said it had been broken across the hotel since yesterday and no one had come out to fix it and he didn’t know why- he was visibly uncomfortable carrying out his work and was sweating profusely- I felt sorry that he had to work in those conditions. We went to reception, perplexed as to why they hadn’t mentioned this when we checked in. They immediately offered to refund our money, clearly a routine they had been doing for two days, but were not in anyway apologetic. I didn’t want a refund, I wanted to be able to sleep and not be in reception for over 30 minutes in the middle of the night. 

Their manner was infuriating and they didn’t offer anything for the inconvenience until I suggested they ring hotels nearby to find an available room, I then had to insist that they paid the difference- all of these are things that should have been routinely offered as a matter of adequate customer care. I then had to ask the receptionist to send an e-mail to the hotel he had booked a room at, to confirm the price we would be paying as he had not mentioned this on the phone- so I have no idea how the new hotel would have known this.  

I understand things break and it is extremely hot, but the way this was dealt with was unacceptable. Given that it had been broken for two days, all customers should have been notified prior to their arrival so they could sort out alternative accommodation if they wished, we certainly should have been told when we checked in and I shouldn’t have had to drive the resolution for members of staff that couldn’t seem to care less, despite a lobby full of upset people.

We are now in a hotel that we did not want to be in, disappointed and angry. 

Unless you’re going in the winter and you don’t expect to be dealing with the reception staff much, I wouldn’t suggest bothering.",1,2018,07,25
119,Very good,"The sunborn was a good stay minus a few problems I had.

The rooms were beautiful, spacious and clean. It might be a tad little bit overpriced but I guess that's subjective depending on who you are and what you're after. The beds are fantastic and the facilities/furniture in the room are of good quality. We had a good night's sleep. I have read other reviews of rooms being noisy due to parties on the top deck but we were on a lower floor so we were fine and didn't have any noise-related issues.

The first thing I had a problem with were the pillows, they are very large which gave me some problems personally as I need my pillows to be smaller or I get neck pains. I would recommend adding two smaller pillows on every bed in case of other guests having the same requirements as myself. 

One last thing is that the fridge wasn't cold. We didn't really need the fridge but in the future it would be good if these fridges can be checked. It should be 4 degrees maximum. 

To be quite fair to the hotel and the staff, I didn't notify the staff of the issues I mentioned above and if I had done so they probably would have rectified it, so don't take these negatives are harsh criticisms. I'm just including it so that the hotel can read this review and be aware of possible things to do to their rooms before guests arrive.

Thanks to all the staff at Sunborn, it was a good stay.",4,2018,07,25
119,Lovely hotel!,"My boyfriend booked me this hotel, for my birthday. 
I have to say this was such a lovely hotel! Really looked after us.

My boyfriend did book a room for my birthday. but we changed to a different room, so was unsure if they forgot to move anything from the other one they originally set up. 

Food was lovely! Setting is amazing.",5,2018,07,25
119,Very disappointed ,"This is a real disappointment. I asked for slightly earlier check in but they did not even bother to let me know it was ready earlier.
During check in no details were provided about breakfast, surrounding attractions.
The room was clean but not perfectly clean.
The fridge was empty, just one small bottle of water.
Not even one chair on the balcony.
Plenty of plastic wastes floating in the surrounding water.
And no air conditioning.
They were fixing it with no positive result and 29.5 Celsjus in the room.
And they do not even seem to care. I had to demand water. I have never seen such  neglecting staff..",2,2018,07,24
119,One day stay,"Our first stay in Yacht Hotel and it was amazing! 
Room inside really big and beautiful, breakfast is cheaper to get on the day of check in ( open buffet English breakfast ).
Unfortunately, front of the yacht is closed for guest, so we could see all beauty of the boat. 
Staff really friendly and helpful! 
Hope we will come back again ! ",5,2018,07,22
119,Mixed feelings.....,"The yacht looks lovely from the outside and they certainly serve a cracking Afternoon Tea.    However,  in the evening there are parties on the upper decks with music which vibrates through your room - meaning you simply cannot sleep until at least midnight.   We were in an Exec room on level2 and even with the TV on very loud we could hear it.     The room itself was nice with all the facilities you would expect.    The area around Victoria Dock is a bit dodgy at night so if you do stay at the Sunborn - then stay on the boat and use it's bar/restaurant.",3,2018,07,22
119,Very nice view and decor but NOT GOOD CUSTOMER SERVICE ,"Went yesterday for an Afternoon Tea for my husband birthday. On the phone I requested for a window table, when we went there they gave us a non window table even though I could see lots of window table and it’s first come first serve policy. After requesting again they gave it to us. The tea and cakes came quickly which was good. After that the staff disappeared, not once did they attend to us to see/ask if everything was ok or if we needed anything. Kept trying to make eye contact with they but they avoided and made themselves look busy and it was not a busy afternoon. I am not a fussy person and my expectation is very low but the staff here really disappointed me. Then to put the icing on the cake, the waiter overcharged me. The vegetarian under the sea with no alcohol is £30pp I got charged £70. I was also forced to pay the service charge was discretionary but the waiter told me it’s mandatory. I’m always happy to pay the service charge but only when the service is great. The view and decor is fantastic but they need to recruit staff who have a passion for providing excellent customer service. ",3,2018,07,22
119,A special treat luxury e perience,"What a fantastic alternative to a noisy hotel in the middle of busy Lindon.
Luxury yacht, fabulous service, enormous cabins in quiet docks. Stylish and well decorated, not far from tube stations, restaurants, O2 and Emirates Skylift over Thames. We checked in and then sat in the rear deck, in the sun, for a welcome cocktail - classy,
Breakfast was lovely, although uneven  restauran5 carpet is a health hazard and needs correcting/replacing.
Staff were more than helpful.
Rooms were well equipped. Huge comfortable bed.
Central stairway with chandelier hints at pr3vious life of luxury,
Loved it!",5,2018,07,19
119,Wonderful,"A big thank you to Ajay and ALL the team for making our trip most memorable. Your hospitality and attention to every detail does not go unnoticed, you are all a true credit to the term ‘hospitality’. Thank you from us all, Amanda, Jess and Alex",5,2018,07,18
119,Great stay," booked sunborn as accommodation for a show we was seeing at the o2! We Found it at a reduced price via bedfinder/travel zoo! When we arrived we was not dissapointed! We loved the splendour of the inside of the boat with gold and wood effects! Staff where very friendly and accommodating! Although nearly all who we dealt with were foreign there English could not be faulted , if you decide to book , book with the sea view and not with the dock as I did ! Still however it was not unsightly! A lot of money has been spent developing this area of London and it has a real cool vibe. Having settled in we sat on the back of the boat in glorious sunshine having a few drinks (£10 a g&t)  with some great ambient music being played by the dj on the back of the sun deck to(Saturday night)!We almost didn't want to leave for the show! Travelling to the 02 was great as the emirates cable cars are a 5 minute walk from the sunborn and a real nice highlight of the trip with great views which enhance your journey. Next morning breakfast was served at a price of £20 which I found to be more reasonable! Very good with plenty of options! All in all we had a memorable time on the sunborn! However that said we was lucky and had two glorious day on the river , but I couldn't help think that had it not been blistering sunshine there was little Else to do on the boat ! A real excellent choice if you are visiting the o2 Arena and plenty of social media worthy pictures staying on a super yacht! :-) enjoy ",5,2018,07,17
119,3rd Visit - Still great Value,"This was our 3rd stay and it didn't disappoint, yes its a little distance to the centre attractions, however its half the price of pretty much every other hotel in its class. Great views onto the river, nice big comfortable rooms, loads of nice little bars and restaurants locally, ideal for the 02 and cable cars, and only a £15 uber to covent garden etc... We're back next week for our 4th visit!",5,2018,07,16
119,A little treat,"Had a lovely night on here for OH birthday surprise. Arrived at the reception and was greeted by several staff checking people in. A smooth check-in only taking a couple of minutes. A quick explanation of where everything was on the boat and we went off to find our cabin. The whole place was clean and shiny. I wouldnt fancy the job of polishing the brass deckheads.  The cabin was a perfect size for 3 of us. A large king bed and a sofa bed which was already made up. We were located riverside and had.a small balcony. The room was clean with everything you need. Coffee machine, hairdryer, iron and ironing board and even extra blankets. We decided to go to the bar to see if the reviews I had read previous were true. Sad to say they are. We waited 35 minutes from ordering to our drinks arriving. People who were coming in after us were getting served before us. Hence we only had one. We ate off the boat that night. It was quite a hot night but thankfully we had air conditioning.  We decided to go up for breakfast at 8.30. We arrived at just the right time because it started to fill up quite quickly after that. We were sat at a table at the large panoramic window and had a great view. The choice for breakfast was great. Cooked,  continental it  was all there. Check out was swift too.
I was disappointed with a lack of nautical themed accessories apart from the odd picture it doesn't distinguish from a hotel on land. 
Just for a heads up they do take £40 from a credit/debit card so if you use the bar it can automatically be taken off of that. We didn't use it as.we paid cash at the bar and so when we checked out it was reimbursed back to the card. 
All in all we had a great night and would use it again.",4,2018,07,15
119,Lovely backdrop,"My friends and I visited the yaucht for afternoon tea. As it was a lovely day we requested a table outside to appreciate the wonderful view. Had the weather not been so good we would of been disappointed with the dining area. It generally looked very tired and the carpets looked dirty and unfitted for such a so called luxury experience. The afternoon tea was ok but have had better for the same price. The staff were very attentive and accommodating. The Sunborn is an impressive vessel from the outside and we were glad that we had the afternoon experience. That said if we had sat inside it would have been a difference story, definately in need of a makeover. However, we enjoyed our stay and have done it the once on a glorious day weather wise. Would we go again, probably not.",3,2018,07,15
119,"Fantastic value, high quality","Sunborn is a hidden gem.  Great accommodation, large rooms, and the wow factor of being aboard a ship.  And only 20 mins from central London.  I would thoroughly recommend Sunborn for business and leisure trips.",5,2018,07,15
119,A wonderful luxury yacht hotel experience in Docklands!,"My wife and I booked a Saturday night on Sunborn and it was a great experience from start to finish!

For something completely different and with a real touch of luxury this purpose build floating hotel takes some beating.

The reception, dining rooms and bars were all of an excellent standard with welcoming and friendly excellent staff.

Our cabin (Yacht Classic Riverroom) was a decent size, well appointed and comfortable bed.

The inclusive breakfast was of the highest quality with no corners cut in terms of the products used.

A definite re-booking is on the cards.",5,2018,07,15
119,Amazing rooms and great location. ,"An impressive looking and novel concept staying on yacht/ boat in London. The rooms are vast ...the largest and most comfortable bed I’d slept in for a long time. 
If you want a fully stocked mini bar you need to request at booking stage. 
The same goes for the restaurant as it’s open to the public so we couldn’t get a table which was disappointing. 
The same for the spa. 
The bar area outside offered an amazing view the bar snack options were okay I had the selection of meats the only thing missing was a selection of olives to add a variance to the platter. 
The only negative being the wines a poor selection of reds and when I tasted them they were bland and musty as if they had not been stored correctly/cheap wines. Our fantastic waitress got a bottle from the restaurant  which was better than the bar selection. 

Nice friendly staff and all in all a wonderful experience. 
",4,2018,07,14
119,Great staff,"I have stayed in this hotel over 8 times. The location is perfect for events at the Excel and is very easy to get to from London City airport.
The staff are professional and very accommodating. They remember me even if it has been months between visits.
The rooms are very large, all of a very high quality. There are no baths but the showers are roomy.
The food is exquisite and the gin with the dried fruit display is lovely!",5,2018,07,12
119,25th Wedding Anniversary,"Only booked one night. When we booked we informed the booking agency that it is/was our silver anniversary. We arrived one hour before booking in time. However the receptionist allowed us to book in and informed us that our room was ready and also we where ""bumped"" up to the Classic room as it was a special occasion. Nice touch. Once we got to our room a tray of chocolates and a letter from the staff was presented. Fantastic. Lovely room with balcony view, free wi fi (only for a day but this was fine). We had booked dinner and breakfast,(book breakfast once you get there - it is cheaper). We also had drinks in the main bar/rooftop. Excellent service and hats off to the bar staff for making an excellent Pims! We imagine the hotel would be busier if there was an event at the Excel, but whe we visited, it was not too busy. We would thoroughly recommend the Sunborn, even if it only for the day/night. Top quality service,clean and everything you would want.",5,2018,07,12
119,Week at the Docks,"I needed to go to the Royal Docks on some followup business.  When I was there the first time I stayed downtown but when I visited the Docks I liked the look of the Sunborn.  When I came back i made a point to stay there.  the room price was reasonable.  

I go there on a Saturday and my room was ready early.  The clean the rooms in the morning each day and if you come a little early the rooms normally are ready.  I had a colleague who had the same experience.  early entry into the room.  I was staying on the 3rd floor and had a nice balcony to sit on outside.  I did a little bit of typing while I was sitting out there and it was great.  My room was nice size and the bed was very comfortable. The shower was great, the water was hot but there was a small issue with the bathroom as there was a step to get up to the bathroom and I kept forgetting it was there.  

at lunch there and it was very good.  I had the buffet breakfast and enjoyed it very much.  The staff there is wonderful and everyone wants to aid in some way at the slightest sign of an issue.

This is a must if you are in London.  you can take the Dockway Light Rail (DLR) into Tower Hill station for about 2 dollars.  the docks are vibrant and plenty of good places to eat  ",5,2018,07,11
119,Weekend Escape ,"Arrived just after 3pm and reception staff checked everyone in quickly. By 3:30 we had unpacked and headed to the balcony bar at the stern, excellent weather made for a pleasant afternoon. Our wives soon spotted the champagne bar and we enjoyed excellent service. One small disappointment was not being told we needed to make dinner reservations ahead of time, however, lots of nice restaurants just a short walk away. Will definitely think of returning soon.",4,2018,07,11
119,All show: little substance. Save your cash & book at the iBis across the street!,"We stayed for a couple nights having booked via SecretEscapes. If you can get over the yacht novelty (which doesn’t last btw), then we found the stay to be fairly average. The decor was out-dated: i’d say very 90s. River view was ok but we were immediately beneath a flight path which we didn’t mind. Breakfast was decent - the dinner was ok (yes: just ok and disappointgly for us, very alcohol based - e.g. wine infused salmon!!! ). London has many genuine 5* hotels and the yacht concept aside, I found this to be more of a 4* venue. If my review sounds critical, note I’m comparing it to South Asian 5* hotels and other worldwide brands like the Mariott/Langham etc. I felt the hotel is trying to achieve that genuine luxury badge but are not there yet. Its the small things: worn carpets or buldging, shabby/dirty ceiling tiles, dust in parts of the room etc. The staff are attentive but have the typical European blunt tones which can come across quite stern to us Brits. My advice would be to save your money and book literally across the parade at the iBis for a quarter of the price (which we did in the end). £299 vs £69 and treated the Mrs to a Michelin star meal with the monies saved",3,2018,07,11
119,"Amazing, so fancy!! ","My partner and I stayed here for our anniversary and it was perfect for the occasion. It made it really special staying on such a fancy boat in such an amazing city. 
The room was clean, large and had an absolutely huge bed. The breakfast included a wide array of different food and the foyer looked like Titanic with a fancy spiral staircase! 
To get to the centre of London it takes a fair while on the tube but it's so worth it and didn't bother us since we are familiar with the tube. It's also really close to the emirates cable car across the Thames! 
I cannot fault this hotel and would love to come back sometime. ",5,2018,07,10
119,Poor service,"Booked online through Hotel.com, cost £330 for one night with breakfast. 
Checked in at 3pm as advised. Seemed quiet and no advice given by staff to book for dinner. Approached restaurant at 7pm, there were only a few people in there, maybe 10 - 12, so mostly empty. But turned away no offer of a later slot and told only the bar was available which had 2 screens with the World Cup showing, which was not what we had in mind.
 Staff were not helpful and we left to eat elsewhere. Upon return the restaurant was still only 60% full at 9pm.
They should advise if booking is essential but the restaurant was not full. Very dissapounted ruined our anniversary. Will not be booking again. Room and facilities are good.",1,2018,07,10
119,Great room and dock view with a couple of minor issues,"We had an executive double dock view room with a balcony. Dinner bed and breakfast deal with secret escapes for only £270 for both of us all in. The room was most excellent. Proper luxury yacht type room with lovely balcony overlooking the dock with views out to Canary wharf and beyond. Our all inclusive dinner deal included 3 courses of whatever we wanted off the a la carte menu, which surprised me. I thought we'd get some fixed prix restrictive set menu, but no! The communal areas of this yacht are becoming a bit tired to be honest, dirty carpets in the bar and restaurant and evidence of general malaise setting in. The breakfast service in the morning was a complete shambles. Far too many guests for what is quite a small restaurant area. Ques of people waiting for breakfast and sitting around the lobby waiting for a seat. Not good. People were getting a bit shirty, even by London standards. The staff were completely overwhelmed with people. Self service but stuff had run out and wasn't being replenished so there were then even more ques waiting for food. The food throughout our stay was to a high standard though. The champagne bar was closed throughout out stay. Don't know why. We ventured up out onto the top open deck above the restaurant and main bar (where there was a closed bar)  for a bit of peace.Nobody else seemed to know you could go up there as we were the only 2 people up there. We also found a secret little open deck at the front of the boat again- nobody else there. There were many angry cockneys on sunday check out day. ",4,2018,07,10
119,good location,"excellent hotel and had a lovely air conditioned sleep, lovely cocktails and in a very good location especially if your visiting the excel centre or just a picturesque walk along the dock side as it is stunning and makes a lovely stroll looking at what London has to offer 
will stay here again",5,2018,07,09
119,Cool Breakfast,I paid for a upgrade of room which got me free breakfast but am glad it was free and not what ever they were charging for it. To say it was cold was a understatement. It was a buffet style and even when the brung out fresh stuff it was lukewarm. I said to the girl at check out about it thinking she might take something of the bill but no she never she just said sorry about that and roll her eyes. The carpets throughout the boat was like they was moles below them I thought from a health and safety side of thing you could trip on them and fall and hurt yourself.,3,2018,07,09
119,Wow,"We did have a technical issue on our first stay, but this was rectified and we stayed the day of the Remembrance Day at the Cenotaph, the place excelled, the room was so comfy, and the breakfast surpassed everything. Would revisit at the drop of a hat",5,2018,07,09
119,Fantastic!,"our second anniversary gift from me to my fiancee, was just amazing. everything was immaculate and excellent quality. Service wonderful! We have even considered changing our wedding venue to the Sunborn as its got the big wow factor. just excellent all round.",5,2018,07,09
119,"Great location, lovely quirky stay","We got a great deal so this was excellent value for money for us. The lift is an interesting experience. Our room was a spacious one which was clean and bright. There were only 2 UK sockets - plenty of EU ones. 
The snack menu was overpriced - fries were nice but ‘chunky chips’ were oven chips. The bar breakfast menu was good value though - we had croissant but baps looked lovely too. Slow service but we were in no rush. 
Checkout was 11.00am which was good. Desk staff were excellent.
We stayed on a hot day with little breeze so sitting outside was great with a glorious view. 
We went to a concert at the O2 and the location was good - took a cable car over - sadly closed before end of concert though so tube back. It is located right on a tube station and next door to the excel centre. 
We would definitely stay again,",4,2018,07,08
119,"Room good, but customer service and food lacking","I was in London for business, having seen the Sunborn on a previous trip, decided to book in for 3 nights. 
Rooms are spacious with balcony area, nespresso machine, couch / living area + a lovely large comfy bed. Compact bathroom but with all essential amenities.  Ironing board and iron in closet, bathrobe and slippers.  This is the highlight of the Sunborn London. 

Unfortunately service was lacking and food was poor. 
On this particular visit the service we received was very slow, lacked knowledge of menu, pricing and the ability to be solution oriented. 

We ordered lunch and after 50mins of waiting had to cancel the order as it was no where in sight.
I ordered a selection of nuts while waiting.... the waiter came back to say there was no price on the menu but they weren't free so went to find out how much..... considering we were booked in for 3 & 4 nights.... he couldn't provide us with complimentary nuts while we ordered drinks?.... Very poor and he subsequently never came back with the price either. 
When I did order food, it was not great. I ordered a medium rare steak and it came through as well done (very well done). At check out this was discounted off my bill, thank you to your efficient receptionist, but disappointing all the same. 

When we requested water at reception/bar area, we were also charged. As residence and water being complimentary in our rooms, why on earth are you charging us at reception/bar? 

Our rooms were also tagged under the incorrect names and stay duration. This resulted in WiFi logins not working and when I checked out earlier I had to ensure this did not affect my colleague, as they were looking for her to vacate her room. 

Overall, the room was good, but food and service was very weak. 

Considering the price to stay on the Sunborn, I would expect a greater level of service and knowledge of who is a resident to ensure efficiency and satisfaction. 
It is the little things that make the difference and I found this strongly lacking at the Sunborn London.",2,2018,07,08
119,Stunning central London location,Fantastic stay at Sunborn. Perfect location for the O2. We were there to see Queen at the O2 and was so easy to get to from here . We jumped on The Emirates cable car just a 5 minute walk from Sunborn. Great views. With the help of some beautiful English weather and fantastic service and facilities from Sunborn it really was the Perfect stay. ,4,2018,07,08
119,Fantastic,From the moment we walked in till we left every member of staff was engaging and attentive. Our room was excellent and we upgraded to a river view which was great.  We went to a concert at the o2 so this is a great place to stay as you can get the cable car over to the venue.,5,2018,07,07
119,Fab afternoon Tea,"Visited with friends for afternoon Tea.
Great location and so easy to find.beatiful decor inside with a lovely staircase centrepiece.
There is a choice of 3 afternoon teas and we opted for under the sea which consists of Crab, lobster prawns and cod sandwiches and rolls. Such a difference from the normal boring cucumber sandwiches.
We also opted for a glass of champagne which was a steep £13 a glass but this was for a special occasion.
One thing which was disappointing was the staff were not very attentive. Nobody explained what was what. I had to ask several staff if the sandwiches could be replenished and if we could have more teas/coffee! No one asked if everything was ok with our meal!
However I would defo recommend this place for a special occasion. You can go out on the deck and have a drink after which is a nice little touch.",4,2018,07,07
119,Great hotel,"The sunborn hotel by Excel is a lovely hotel with friendly and helpful staff we were given an upgrade to the 5th floor I would 100% stay there again... but beware of the Indian restaurant called Marina grill 2mins away misleading menu, minuscule portions and they don’t honour their 10% collection discount, do not eat there food tastes horrible",5,2018,07,06
119,Birthday treat,"Recently having a bad experience with a hotel in another city I wanted to be sure that I booked something a little special for this trip and the Sunborn didn’t disappoint. The reception area was beautiful with a crystal chandelier and the Yachts original feature of the staircase. We were given a complimentary room upgrade which was really lovely especially seeing as the night away was for my husbands birthday. Our room was spacious with a huge comfortable bed. There was a hairdryer in the very clean bathroom, and Molton Brown toiletries.  Iron and ironing board, fridge with complimentary bottles of water, fluffy towels, robes and slippers. Really nothing to be negative about regarding the room or staff. We didn’t use the restaurant as we used the hotel as a base so can’t comment on that. The one thing I did think could be reviewed and changed is that my debit card was used to take £40 in the event we spent anything during our stay. We didn’t spend any extra so will be refunded the £40 but this could take up to 5 days to reach my account.  It would’ve been better to just take my card details and charge the correct amount at the end of the stay if needed. ",5,2018,07,06
119,Well Located and Different ,"We found this to be a very comfortable place to stay and they do a splendid Afternoon Tea.
The staff are friendly and it is well located for amenities, especially the eXcel which is feet away and the Emirates cable cars over the Thames which gives s great view.
There is Disabled parking at Sunborn Yacht, just be sure to let them know first ",4,2018,07,06
119,Business traveller,"Great location, can be good value dependant on demand, good standard of room - very quiet, nice comfy large bed, spotlessly clean. Well equipped with fridge, kettle etc. Local restaurants and bars good",4,2018,07,06
119,"Disappointing, would not recommend","My experience was no very good.  Room Service order was not delivered as requested & plate uplift request was pointless.  Breakfast was awful, stone cold with dried up bacon and inedible - not a good experience especially since I was charged £15 - especially since I ended up with a piece of toast and a mini pastry.  ",2,2018,07,06
119,Exceeded expectations,"Spacious room, extremely comfortable bed. Room and public areas were spotless. Very pleasant and helpful staff - a credit to your company. Food in the restaurant was very good. Very easy to get across to the o2 by using cable car or DLR/tube. Excel very close by. Loved the nearby Crystal - perfect for coffee and a snack.",5,2018,07,04
119,Stop off before flight ,The people and service is excellent the decor is a bit “cruise liner” but the people are great. Food is very decent. It comes off like more experience / difference than something you’d do again. I love the Muzak in the Resturant. Think Daniel Pemberton. “Little big planet”. Amazing. ,4,2018,07,03
119,Wedding reception,"The Sunborn Is a beautiful place.  Interior was absolutely stunning and l thought what a perfect place my friend had picked to have a small intimate reception.  We were greeted by a nice lady in suit and again l thought perfect as she seemed so professional.  There were tables outside on the deck for those who couldn’t be seated outside.  The sun was blazing hot and then we attempted to put up the large umbrellas, but were quickly informed that they did not work.  So the sun was beating down on some of us trying to eat.  I went to ask for a cup of water and the lady serving it was so stone faced and unfriendly.  Her other colleagues also were so stone faced and unfriendly and simply not nice.  At one point one of them literally acted like she was going to be made dirty when people were passing by and yes unfortunately we started to feel that this cold behaviour was because we were black.

I have attended many beautiful functions and would have definitely placed Sunborn on my high end list, but this saddened me.  The bride and groom paid to celebrate their marriage in such a beautiful place but was treated so poorly right down to having to push to get the wedding cake put up.  Other than the woman in the suit it clearly appeared that courteous customer service training was not extended to those behind the bar.  Regardless of the colour or creed of your paying customer, smiling and being nice does not cost anything and goes a long way.  Its sad that the bride and groom are left with hearing complaints from there guest at a time of jubilation.  

This has saddened me as this is the first time l have been made to feel uncomfortable to the point l have to write such a review.  Sunborn you have great potential and l have no doubt business is booming.  Its a beautiful place but please speak to your staff.",2,2018,07,02
119,Surprise weekend,"My partner booked this hotel as part of my birthday celebrations big 50 this year, it was really unique,lavish cabin by anyone’s standards, I have cruised before ( not that this place leaves the dock ) the accommodation was lovely well equipped nice balcony we had a dock view, very comfortable bed. Reception staff excellent as were the dining staff, very professional. We had drinks in the bar, service was very slow( over half an hour to bring 2 drinks, no nibbles available (on a Saturday?) they cobbled something together after another 15 mins. Shame really cos it was nice sat outside with this fantastic weather, I’m not sure if they were short staffed, but most of us had to clear our own table of glasses and debris, there was a wedding breakfast going on so maybe they were busy with that, felt somewhat neglectful. We ate at the Lands End restaurant, staff were excellent, however the noise from upstairs wedding party was beyond distracting, the music,singing and woman shouting on the mic, we complained ( politely as did others) couldn’t wait to get up and get away from the noise. The meal was okay my partner had pre paid for the a la carte menu, the waitress wanted us to order starter, main and dessert, we (and other diners) did not want to order dessert, not sure if you could fit it,they said it helped the kitchen staff???:-/ Our starters were nice scallops for me ham hock terrine for my partner, mains we ordered steak medium rare both come well done couldn’t be bothered complaining as the noise from upstairs was so distracting just wanted to get on with it and get out, had dessert again nothing special.
Breakfast next day was lovely, lots of choice it’s a self service buffet but excellent quality, all well presented and hot, big tick, very enjoyable again lovely smiley staff. Sorry to moan about that wedding party, someone from the staff did go and tell them to turn it down, but only when several people complained.",5,2018,07,02
119,Fantastic stay,"This was a 50th birthday treat for my friend. Can’t fault anything, staff were professional and friendly. The girls in the spa were lovely,definitely recommended a visit to them. Food in the restaurant was fantastic beautiful presentation. I can recommend a stay on the Sunborn and I will book again.",5,2018,07,01
119,Distinctly pleasanr,"Unique and somewhat different to a conventional hotel, and perfect for staying in London after an event at the O2 or the nearby exhibition centre. 

The room was clean and functional, though the coffee machine was broken and the sink didn’t drain properly in the bathroom. Breakfast was a little lacklustre and our room overlooking the dock was noisy due to a generator close by which was intermittent throughout the night. 

A few minor niggles that took away from a premium feel, such as butter being brought to us from an adjacent table rather than the kitchen and poorly maintained carpets in the restaurant area (also mentioned by another reviewer). 

Staff were polite although not particularly enthusiastic about their roles. We were not given directions to our room or given details about WiFi access. No-one enquired about our stay at any time. Plates were not cleared away from our table despite the restaurant not being relatively quiet.

Overall it was a pleasant enough experience, but felt overpriced for the level of service and quality provided. 

Recommended for close proximity to the O2 and ExCel but expect a basic level of service on par with a Premier Inn. ",3,2018,06,30
119,"The saying goes, 'You can't polish a.......'","From the outside, some pictures look amazing. Get there though and from the dockside - it almost looks like a naval boat. The back end, where the entrance is, looks okay but - yeah - it doesn't look as good as the photos make out and that's the problem with this hotel; the photos make it look exclusive and lavish but it just isn't and even falls far short on that.

Check in was easy enough but you have to get the lift to the floor with the rooms. There was a foreign family who had filled the lift before we got there. Fair enough, we can wait. But they just kept going up and down. The second lift didn't seem to want to come and this family must have thought the lift was their room. In the end - receptionist came out and showed them how to work the lift (you swipe a card and press a button, it's not technical) and we waited another few minutes for the lift to come back to us.

Check-in was pretty much silent, I hasten to add. There was no friendliness. The man wasn't rude but - neither did he seem to want to know about our journey, how we were - you know, basic stuff they talk to you about in other hotels whilst they are setting stuff up on the computer. 

The interior of the reception area was pretty looking. But that was expected. First impressions and all that. Shame it went downhill the closer you looked.

The room was Executive room with a sea view and balcony. First of - the balcony is more of a ledge. It has two seats and if you're both sitting out there and the one furthest from the door wants to go in for the bathroom or whatever, the other person would need to step in to give them room to come in... There is no room whatsoever. The view itself is nothing special. The water looks grim (you know that anyway) and around is industrial estates, skyscrapers and a view of the O2 which looks the same all the way around so when you have seen it from one angle, it's nothing special.

The room itself was an okay size. Pictures gave the impression of it being bigger. Shame we had to move two wet floor signs away from the door for us to get in but - hey ho. The carpet inside the room stunk and was soaking wet so as soon as I got my shoes off - wet socks... And to think - I thought the wet floor signs were for the hallway, not the actual room! There were tea-making facilities, a couple of bottles of water and a tablet to order room service and treatments etc.

Now we ordered room service:
1 x sparkling water
1 x orange juice
1 x lemonade
2 x cakes
1 x pepperoni pizza
1 x burger and fries

Total cost = £49

The pepperoni pizza showed up without pepperoni on, the fries were cold and the cake we wanted was ""sold out"" so we were offered chocolate cake. When the cake came - it was the driest and stalest thing I have ever seen. £6.00 a portion and it was absolutely foul. Had it not been so late (just before 11pm), I would have sent the whole lot back and gone out venturing for food. As it was I mentioned to the receptionist upon checkout the next day that they needed to sort room service and have a word because it was the foulest thing I'd had the misfortune to try. They refunded the service charge... 

Like I said - from the pictures it all looks posh but when you get there, you realise it is far from it. Now when we went the rooms were really cheap. It cost us £148.37 through booking.com (not including the ridiculous charge for room service) and for London, that is a good price. Book it if you want to be close to the ExCel but do NOT expect a four star hotel. I have stayed in many and this is far from four star on ANY level. Be warned though - other nights I have seen it more than double in price and it is definitely NOT worth anywhere near that.",2,2018,06,30
119,Average stay,Booked one night on this “luxury” yacht as it was our wedding anniversary and my wife’s birthday the next day. Did inform via email about this but nothing was mentioned. The room itself was big enough and we had a river view but as there’s not much to see it doesn’t really matter either way. We had nice molton brown toiletries and a lavazza coffee machine plus a couple of biscuits and 2 complementary waters. It seemed clean enough but found 2 screws on the floor near the bathroom door and the towels smelt a bit funny. I’ve stayed in hotels that have the same extras just not as bigger room and cheaper and wasn’t wowed like I thought I would be. Checking in was ok as it wasn’t busy but the key card hadn’t been activated correctly so we got all the way to the room before we realised as we followed another guest down to level 2 and had to go all the way back. Breakfast was ok nothing special. Again I was expecting to be wowed but it was just ok. The carpet in the breakfast area was all ruffled and didn’t look good and when we arrived for breakfast and gave our room number they said we had already been for breakfast!  All in all ok stay but won’t go again and wouldn’t recommend as a treat for anyone. Also is it just me or do all the replies look like they have been copied and pasted and not really been given any thought to?,3,2018,06,29
119,Lovely room,"Stayed here for the second time now, everything was as good as my first visit last year. The rooms are spacious and the bed comfortable. The only downside is the cost of wine on board.
The bathroom has a heated floor and towels are huge and heavy, was fantastic.",5,2018,06,27
119,Fantastic stay,"Stayed for one night in June for a concert at London stadium. The hotel is in a great location, right by the excel and the DLR. 

Staff were all extremely helpful and polite. 

The rooms are lovely and clean. My only moan is the bed was 2 singles pushed together. They were held by something however you can still feel where the mattresses meet. 

Would stay here again gladly.",4,2018,06,25
119,Eagle Weekend,We had our travel agents training here with our Directors from USA and our all white event in the evening. This hotel is exquisite inside. The bedrooms are spacious and make you feel like you are on a cruise ship. Nice view of the river. The staff were on the ball and very helpful. Will be back at this hotel next week for a surprise pre 16th birthday celebration for my daughter. Am sure she will be over the moon with my surprise,5,2018,06,24
119,Loved this 'hotel',"We are boat biased so finding this place was a great find.
Room we had was quay side, if your there for a while I would recommend water side. Room was a good size and we'll appointed, big comfortable bed and good pillows.
Ate in one of the restaurant at lunchtim, while not cheap but worth the money. I see some bad reviews for the Sunborn, but we found the staff friendly and helpful. 
We would definitely stay again.",5,2018,06,24
119,Great location and better than average room with 110% staff,Whilst aspects of the boat were tired (decoration) the staff clearly made up for what was a very memorable stay. Nothing was too much to ask for and if any single aspects had to be singled out it was the staff were brilliant. An early closing bar was a problem but again the positive aspects of this location make this a must stay hotel. Can't wait to revisit.,4,2018,06,22
119,Nice Enough,"Was a pleasant stay. Very impressed with the condition of the bathroom in our suite. Nice view of the river. The best feature was the restaurant..Lands End, the food is OUSTANDING and the service, by a young lady who had just started, her name escapes me, was absolutely incredible; she served our table of 8 with a smile and made my guests feel nothing was too much trouble. The rooms are a decent size, amenities are great. The best part about this hotel is exactly that..that it's a yacht.. What could be improved?   Well the restaurant/indoor bar area needs updating. The booking for spa facilities could be simplified though this appears to be an external outfit, I think the staff there are excellent, though bar food took exceedingly long the evening my daughter ordered.  All in all. Definitely worth it.  If you're driving over, the public car park is round the corner and a short walk. Make sure you get some great pictures!!",4,2018,06,21
119,Would have been 5 stars had your bar staff been professional!,Cabins (rooms) ate great - and I work for the largest cruise company in the world! But bar staff leave much to be desired as they have 'favourites' and priorities over other guest! Not good for your level of hotel!,4,2018,06,20
119,One night stay which certainly impressed ,"A great experience from the moment you first saw the yacht; it is wow. 
Great friendly and helpful staff. Superb entrance with beautiful staircase and chandelier.
Lovely room/cabin. As you would expect tea and coffee (decent pod coffee).
Dressing gown and slippers are a nice touch.
Absolutely no rocking swaying or movement.
Great view of the powerboat racing was a bonus.

Breakfast was good and the staff attentive without being overbearing.

If you are staying at the weekend check the DLR is fully operational to allow extra time as bus replacement wasn’t as frequent.
",5,2018,06,20
119,Cool Hotel On A Yacht,"If your looking for something different then staying in a normal hotel then try, “The Sunborn London Yacht Hotel.” I recommend getting a cabin with a balcony so you can sit out & relax while looking out on to the Victoria Docklands. They also have a deck called the Champagne Deck where you can sip Champagne on Deckchairs & admire the view. It’s especially good if it’s a sunny day. A nice perk also was that I got complimentary white chocolate Truffels when they found out it was my birthday. Our waitress Axenia was very attentive & friendly & made my wife & I feel very welcome when we were having dinner in the restaurant. Also very handy if you are wanting to see a concert at The O2 Arena as it’s just across the water using the Emirates Air Line Cable Car.",4,2018,06,19
119,Excellent,"I had a one night stay in an executive suite with a balcony. The hotel is kept to a very high standard and the staff are very professional. The room is a good size although I expected a sofa, but it included a desk and lots of storage space. King size bed was not very comfy, at this class I expected better. Bathroom lights were faulty which was annoying getting ready with just a dim spot light. Although I was dockside I had a great view of the area, the garden chairs were appreciated.  Room service pizza wasn't that great. Breakfast buffet was fantastic, everything cooked to perfection.
Very security conscious - lots of CCTV and access control.
Perfectly located by the eXcel.  I would stay again. ",5,2018,06,19
119,Terrible place to have a drink !,"I have overnight stayed on the boat 2/3 times , yes a very nice boat . BUT I would not recommend going there for a drink after any of the shows at excel - busy bar with one person serving and the girl clearing one table refusing to offer table service ! 

What is up with these places,  surly customer service is everything , let Amazon take control and you would see the service to It’s customers rapidly improved . So bad will never stay here ever again !",2,2018,06,19
119,Excellent location for Excel and 02,"Great place to stay, nice, clean rooms and sitting out on the deck in the evening was perfect.  Ordered late night food - pizza and sandwich but bread was too dry to eat but it was past midnight..  Felt a bit let down at breakfast but only little issues and i am trying to reachmy 200 words.  Had to ask a couple of times for our hot drinks and then ask for milk",4,2018,06,19
119,Amazing! ,"What a hotel! I was after something a little different for an overnight birthday treat for my partner. We have a 10 month old so this has been our first getaway since him being born so I wanted to treat my partner for her birthday. 

I’m so glad I chose this hotel. From the moment we was walking up to the yacht from the Royal docks Emirates Airline we was blown away by the sheer size of the yacht. The entrance is rather grand with lifts up to reception. Here we were swiftly checked in by the friendly staff. We were given some advice on the amenities both onboard and locally. (Interesting fact: the yacht actually floats and is simply moored). 

Back to the lift to the 5th floor where are Executive River facing room was. What an amazing spacious room. The bed was massive with plenty of wardrobe space. The overall size of the room and even the balcony for a London hotel is very generous. We were both very impressed and happy with the room and the stay overall. 

Oh not forgetting the lovely breakfast in bed the following morning. This arrived promptly at the time requested and was hot and to a very good standard. 

We would both highly recommend this hotel to family and friends and fellow trip advisor users. ",5,2018,06,19
119,Amazing!,"Went here to celebrate our 6 years anniversary and absolutely loved it, we ended up upgrading to the suite for one night to make the celebration extra special! 

I’ve been here twice now - highly recommended!",5,2018,06,19
119,Thank you Sunborn,"A surprise stay arranged by my partner. The young lady on the desk (Sorry name not recorded) was excellent and provided a room with a balcony on the 'Starboard' side, great view for the F1 Speed boat race, Thank you.
All the staff here were friendly and had a smile on their faces, which cannot be said for all places I have stayed at.
Great rooms/cabins, will certainly stay again.
Thank you to the team on 'Sunborn' - London.",5,2018,06,19
119,AMAZING!,I booked this for a surprise get away for my husbands 30th birthday and little did I know that there would be surprises involved for me too! We checked into our room to find complimentary chocolates in the room as well as an amazing tea and coffee facility. We then got ready and went for dinner in the lovely lands end restaurant which was so romantic and the food was really tasty! We finished off in the sundown bar for a cheeky drink or two and we found out that one of our drinks was complimentary for my husbands birthday which was such a lovely surprise! The night sleep was brilliant as it was so quiet meaning we had one of the best nights sleep ever! Will definitely recommend to family and friends and will of course stay here again myself! ,5,2018,06,18
119,Perfect for the Powerboating !,"Stayed on the Sunborn as it was close to the racing....The hotel was great in every way, all members of staff, cleanliness, location, price food and the wine !
The front desk staff were exceptional.
Many thanks for a great stay.
",5,2018,06,18
119,Just loved it!,Had the wow factor from the minute we saw it and it certainly didn't disappoint.. A true delight. Nothing was too much trouble. The staff were extremely helpful. Location was brilliant and close to DLR train station. We will return and we will recommend. Thank you!,5,2018,06,18
119,Great Experience,"Booked as seeing Ed Sheeran & thought he was at the O2...but he was at Wembley :o
Having been on a number of cruises, we didn't know what to expect from this taught but exceeded expectations. 
Had a king riverview room which was perfect.
Added bonus of being able to watch F1 speedboat championship from porthole.
Breakfast was excellent.
Would recommend as a treat experience and will look to rebook.",5,2018,06,18
119,Wonderful,First stay on Sunborn and it was impressive right from arrival via the lift to reception. Staff were very welcoming and helpful. Quality was very good with plenty of room. Breakfast was lovely with good choice. Great stay and will be back,4,2018,06,17
119,London stay at The Sunborn,"Excellent in all ways on The Sunborn.  Particularly easy to travel into London, over to Greenwich, across on the Emirates cable car to the O2.  Also recommend visit to The Crystal nearby the Sunborn.  Easy and secure parking at Royal Victoria nearby to The Sunborn.  Cafes and restaurants close by.  Really enjoyed our 4 day visit. ",5,2018,06,14
119,What a great experience ,"The Sunborn offers a lovely taste of luxury in the London’s docklands. The boat itself is moored near the Excel centre and easy to get to.

Once you are inside this is where the luxury begins. Whether you decide to go for a champagne cocktail on the top deck or just to chill out in the lounge bar. We stayed over night and had a fabulous meal on the boat as well.

The boat is very well kept and very clean. The room we stayed was fantastic and beautiful.

Managed to get a deal through secret escapes which was well worth it.

100% worth a visit or an overnight stay",5,2018,06,14
119,Amazing experience,"I loved it ! It's perfect hotel with amazing atmosphere , good location, the suite was perfect! We had jacuzzi and sauna in the room with huge terrace ! Very romantic and relaxing experience and i'll definitely come back ",5,2018,06,13
119,Super Yacht - Dull location,"I cant fault the yacht hotel or the superb room.

The whole setup felt quality and the staff were friendly and helpful.

The room was very comfortable and the bed and sleep quality were top notch.

My only real problem was that it was very quiet, no atmosphere in the bar and the surrounding area is not a place for going out in.  Its right next to the excel centre, but there was no event on and the whole area was deserted on a Friday night.  We had to get the tube back into London to find something going on.

Its well worth having a trip on The Emirates Air Line is a cable car link across the River Thames and then getting the clippers into london.",4,2018,06,12
119,Birthday Treat,"Stayed here for my boyfriends birthday. The overall experience was excellent, on arrival the staff at reception were very friendly, professional and helpful. They tell you everything you need to know for your stay. We had the dock view room which was big enough although the beds wasn’t the most comfortable and the air conditioning didn’t feel as if it was working properly. Considering the suborn is situated right by a flight path you can not hear anything whilst in the room. We also had dinner which was lovely we opted for the set menu the waitress was very helpful and the presentation of the food is brilliant. The only let down is the prices of drinks I feel as if there isn’t a option if you would like something a bit less pricy to drink. We will definitely be returning to the Suborn Yacht.",5,2018,06,11
119,Fantastic stay,"We stayed at Sunborn with friends to celebrate my husband's 70th Birthday.  The staff were all so friendly and helpful.  We ate in the restaurant in the evening.  The food was simply amazing, although the drinks were quite expensive.  However we are in London and this was expected.  We travelled to Greenwich via cable car and then river taxi.  Certainly worth a visit.  Over all the whole experience was fantastic and one we would love to repeat.",5,2018,06,10
119,Luxury Yacht Hotel,"My partner took me here as a wonderful overnight stay as a surprise for my Birthday, to say I was Impressed and surprised is an understatement  - You arrive at Royal Albert Docks and short walk along passing restaurants and hotel to you stand in front of this Super Yacht with Lifts to take you to reception and when you step out of the lift you are greeted with marble floors sweeping stairwell beautiful in every way  - reception staff were lovely and big smiles and helpful information.  There is a lovely bar behind the reception and you can sit out on the decking enjoying a drink or light bite to eat with Fab views  above that is the restaurant  (we didn't actually eat here) again you can sit inside or out and at the top, there is a beautiful champagne bar with outside seating  - pure luxury .  When we entered our room(classic river view room) it's a mini-suite absolutely stunning, it's located right next to Excel centre and directly across the w=suare there are a few bars and restaurants to relax in if you ever want to leave the Yacht LOL  - Our pockets weren't deep enough o have dinner on the boat on this occasion so I'm unable to comment on the food but if its as good as the breakfast we enjoyed the following morning you will be in for a real treat.",5,2018,06,10
119,Loud party event ruined romantic stay,"We booked to celebrate our anniversary and were looking forward to a relaxing break onboard the yacht-hotel. However there was an event also going on in the hotel for a 'travel marketing' company. Once their daytime meeting ended they then started blasting R&B music throughout the hotel. There were half naked party goers in the bathroom getting changed for the evening event and they were walking around trying to recruit other guests into what seemed to be some kind of pyramid scheme. 

The party was so loud we had to skip our pre-paid dinner in the restaurant and find somewhere outside to eat. The party was still in full swing when we returned to the hotel and unfortunately as the bar in which they were in was open the noise spread throughout the other areas of the boat, making an evening drink on the terrace unthinkable. 

We complained and the staff were apologetic but wouldn't recommend a stay in the boat without checking about whether or not conferences like these were booked every Saturday night. It was really unfitting with the ambiance of the hotel.",1,2018,06,10
119,Husbands 50th Birthday Treat not such a Treat,"Stayed for 2 nights for birthday celebration, I did ask for complimentary drink in room, but didn’t receive anything apart from a tray of 4 truffles, which was ok.... on first view room was nice with river view, but found lots of faults with room, from fag burns in curtains and carpet, graffiti on balcony, rips in chair etc as shown in photos. As it was a special occasion I didn’t want to make a fuss and complain but did on leaving and the manager was very apologetic and deducted some money from the bill and said she would send us a complimentary email with offers on for our personal use.  Only received a standard email and I think under the circumstances and the state of the room we should receive a better offer, as at the moment I would not recommend the hotel as the room was quite bad.  The manager did say that they would of moved rooms for us but after u have unpacked u don’t want to move again, and as I said to the manager the room should not of been in the condition it was in the first place!!",2,2018,06,07
119,Basic errors but nice rooms,"Rooms are clean and tidy, bed comfy, no complaints. But here are the negatives:
Orders a g&t and a dessert, the g&t for £12.38 was with 2 small slices of old cucumber but in a modern gin glass. No effort at all for £12.38 so steer clear of the drinks!! Also ordered a dessert, didn’t arrive and just got told they couldn’t find me despite them telling me where to sit outside! Checkout was a farce - overcharged by £30, was eventually sorted but still, basic errrors. 
It’s a decent hotel, but behind the scenes needs addressing as there are much better value hotels that serve cheaper and more enthusiastic drinks in the area.

119,Champagne and Duck Rolls,"Visited after being tipped off by staff at Emirates Airline., and what a great tip.

Sitting on the rear deck in the hot sun drinking champagne what an experience!

If your in Royal Dock treat yourself.

119,Excellent stay at this hotel,"We have just returned from staying in this hotel for 2 nights, we really enjoyed our stay, customer service was excellent and we eat evening meal both nights and the food was devine, breakfast had great selecton, would certainly recommend, ",5,2018,06,06
119,Great location but needs a step up in service,"I took my wife to the Sunborn for her birthday - she'd wanted to go for some time. The hotel is located directly next to the Excel although it's very difficult to get a car or taxi to the entrance unlike most hotels.

The room was large and comfortable so no complaints there. 

One frustration was that the hotel had been taken over for the weekend by The Cannon Run, a luxury performance car rally. This meant the restaurant was closed and relocated to the bar, the outside of the hotel was mobbed and there was a huge amount of noise on Sunday morning. Unfortunately we had not been notified of this as we would have selected an alternative weekend. 

Having booked the restaurant, we decided to go out instead. Being in the bar was way too noisy for an intimate meal for two and the menu is actually quite limited. 

The hairdryer in the room broke on the Saturday but was eventually replaced. However given the price point of the Sunborn, it's surprising that a decent dryer is not provided, rather than the cheap one attached to the bathroom wall. 

I was surprised on checking out that I was not asked how my stay was. Staff are polite and helpful but lack the finesse and customer service expertise of the best hotels. 

It is not a cheap weekend by any means but does provide an iconic location on the river. Don't expect Ritz Charlton service but if you're happy to pay for the location I'm sure you'll enjoy what the Sunborn has to offer.",3,2018,06,05
119,great,"The bed I got was a king size which was so comfortable , room was spacious , staff were very nice except for one of the ladies t the check in desk whom confused me and my partner by not giving correct information.",4,2018,06,04
119,"Lovely massage, afternoon tea ok.","I booked spa treatments and afternoon tea for myself and my mum as a treat for her birthday. I had the back and head massage and she had the back and leg, we both really enjoyed the massages and the staff were lovely and very welcoming. I was disappointed to find that there were no spa facilities after booking as I was under the impression we could have a spa morning followed by massage and afternoon tea. After the treatments we went to the lands end restaurant for our afternoon tea. I had booked this after seeing pictures on the website of nautical themed afternoon tea and on the menu it states 'sea themed assorted cupcakes'. This was another exciting point as we both are very 'boaty' and love all things nautical. The afternoon tea arrived and there was nothing nautical about it, just normal cakes, looking very different from the pictures on the website. Some of the sandwiches were a little dry and the scones were dry but the cakes were very good. After 1 cup of tea the waitress took our tea away, just leaving us with a pot of hot water. The champagne was very nice and chilled. At the end I had to pay £4.50 for some still water which I wasn't aware I would have to pay for - the waitress just asked if we would like some water so I said yes please assuming it was included with the drinks. The staff on reception were really nice and friendly and the boat was very clean. Overall we did have a nice time but probably wouldn't return.",3,2018,06,04
119,Spa Treatment and Afternoon Tea,"We visited today on a WOWCHER, we had a choice of three 50 min treatments, i had the facial and back massage, it was probably the best back massage i have every had, so so good.  We then had afternoon tea which included a glass of champagne, tea and coffee, water and free refills of the food, we couldn't finish it all let alone ask for another one, was really really nice and the staff wonderful, will def return.",5,2018,06,03
119,Business trip,Wonderful stay at a unique hotel in Royal Victoria Dock. Excellent accommodation in a peaceful environment just minutes away from central London. Just what you require for a business or leisure trip to central London,5,2018,06,02
119,One night stay,"Wanted to be close to the O2 for a concert. Wanted something a bit different from your average hotel as we were celebrating both our birthdays and the Sunborn yacht did not disappoint. On arrival we were upgraded from an executive river view room to a suite which was a lovely surprise. Every staff member encountered went above and beyond to make our stay enjoyable and the hotel has an overall great atmosphere and was very clean. It was a shame we only had one night but would have no hesitation to return again. Great experience and dinner and breakfast were both excellent. Location was perfect with great views over the river, 02 and the cable car. ",5,2018,06,02
119,Something different ,"Nice clean hotel if you consider that you stay in a ship. Big room (executive) with full of amenities. Choose the river view for a room. Next to the Excell conference centre which is very convenient. In the website says that you can get a free room upgrade but this I doubt that ever will happen. Typical english breakfast. Don't take anything from the bar. It is like taking your money out of your pocket. They charge you more of what you have to pay. 
Not value for money.",4,2018,06,01
119,Highly recommend ,"Highly recommend the Sunborn Yacht Hotel. Spacious, comfortable, clean rooms with stylish en suites. Stunning reception. Bar has a fantastic view and is a very comfortable area. Location is superb, so quiet you don't realise where you are. Easy to access via the docklands light railway via the excel customs House stop or using the North grewicj o2 stop for the Thames clipper boats then enjoy the view with the air Emirates cable cars. ",5,2018,06,01
119,A unique experience,"We wanted something a little different and Sunborn London ticks all the boxes whilst not skimping on quality.  Staff could not have been more helpful.  We had a superb, spacious room - highly recommend ",5,2018,06,01
119,Underwhelmed,"I can only echo previous reviews in that this place needs a serious upgrade. 

My mother had booked a stay as a surprise for my 30th birthday. Upon entrance it just screams; dated teak wood, tacky chandeliers, shiny weird plastic staircase and patterned 90's carpet that I might find in my Grandparents house. 

Our room wasn't ready when we initially checked in, so our bags were taken and placed in the room for when we returned. The room itself was comfortable and very clean. Nice Molton Brown toiletries in the bathroom. Good shower. Room came with robe and slippers which was a nice touch.

My Mother had booked a river view room with a small balcony, which I believe to be an upgraded room? The balcony had 2 deck chairs - which were comfy to sit down on however, you were basically sat there staring at a black metal ship exterior - so this river view was really hard to see unless you were standing up. The views were nice if you turned your head to the right to look down the river to try and see the o2, otherwise its a view of a housing estate straight ahead. 

I have separately reviewed the lands end restaurant, which I was highly disappointed with. 

All in all, I wouldn't recommend this hotel at all, I think the locality is way too far out of central London and it needs general upgrade/improvements to make it worth the value you pay. What a shame, we were both hoping for bigger and better things.",3,2018,05,31
119,In need of a refurb.. dated,After staying on the Sunborn Gibralter the London Sunborn was a bit of a letdown !! Entrance was closed due to the lifts out of order had to carry luggage to a side door where deliveries were entering the boat along with ourselves. Carried our luggage up 2 flights of stairs to reception area. Checked in & upgraded the room to river view. Whilst waiting for our room had a little walk around not sure what is going on with the carpets but very dated & extremely unsafe for people with less mobility. Could have easily tripped on the uneven folds. The room was comfortable & clean. Despite having one bath towel for two guests. I managed to find housekeeping for another off the trolley. A nice enough stay but not pure luxury in any way shape or form.. doesnt even come close to the luxury of sunborn gib & its fine attention to detail. Shame as it could be amazing.,3,2018,05,31
119,Great find,"We stayed here in the Easter holidays with our 11 year old.  Quick early check in was no problem as room was ready. Super room, great size for a family, clean and comfortable. Very quiet location and would definitely stay again. Great access to public transport.   ",4,2018,05,29
119,Cheeky little overnight stay,"When we arrived the front of house staff were very polite and efficient. We were shown to our room straight away, we were meeting friends there so decided to have afternoon tea while we waited for them to arrive. The afternoon tea was lovely we only had 1 tea between us as we wanted to save our appetite for dinner. There was more than enough for two and the waiter even asked if we wanted more sandwiches. We found our friends and went up on deck to the champagne bar , no waiters were up there so my friend went to find someone to order, it took the waiter quite along time to bring the champagne to us in the meantime other people came up too. I know the waiters were busy but wouldn’t it be a good idea to have cctv or the like to see if you have guest up there after all you were charging near £100 a bottle!  The dinner was lovely and we ordered green beans to go with it. ( our break was ordered with breakfast and evening meal included) there was enough to eat and all the meals were beautifully presented. Staff again were good to a point until they served the drinks. We waited a while again for them. The restaurant was not over run with people so that wasn’t the issue. Breakfast was good, enough to eat and well presented, again we had problems with the drinks not coming quick enough. Leaving on a positive note the room was lovely we had a view of the river. It was clean  and very shiny I’ve never seen wood so well polished.So to sum it up get your staff to listen to your customers drink orders and be a bit more efficient when your customers are waiting, then you would have a dream of a break.",4,2018,05,29
119,Excelente,"Perfect hotel, for weekend. If you wanna go to somewhere different and fantastic, there is the best place to go. Very closer the O2 arena and very quite, nice to relax and to have a romantic night. I really recommend this hotel.",5,2018,05,28
119,Perfectly Situated.,"I was booked into this hotel for work as I was working at MCM Comic-Con the next morning. I arrived at 10pm, but the desk was manned 24/7 by lovely staff. Check-in was quick and easy and the receptionist was very pleasant and talkative, which was nice - considering it was late. I was on the first floor right at the end of the yacht. Room was very tidy and spacious with a lovely view of the river. The room was stocked with tea and coffee with a nice Lavazza machine. The air conditioning was great, especially since I arrived on a humid night. There was a tablet where you could access the internet and order room service. I did order room service from the Night Menu, which arrived fairly quickly and was delivered by a very kind member of staff. Food was lovely! The bathroom was well stocked with shampoos and conditioners. The bed was extremely comfortable and I had a great nights sleep. The hotel was very quite and didn't have any noise from adjoining rooms (maybe due to being at the end of the boat). Overall, was a very pleasant stay. The hotel was very nice and clean and the staff was very helpful throughout. Perfectly situated by the Excel Centre (West Entrance) so was nice and easy to get to work the next day.",5,2018,05,27
119,Good spot for hosting ,"I visited the Sunborn yacht recently for a work event. It’s a great spot to host a drinks or dinner event especially in good weather. I wasn’t able to attend the dinner event but the drinks were enjoyable. 

The only downside was that the red wine served was awful. I may have just had a bad glass however. ",4,2018,05,27
119,Very Disappointing,Overnight stay was booked for us as a treat unfortunately the hotel had private functions being held so none of the facilities were available to us with very little sympathy from staff.  Also breakfast was paid for but our details were not on the list when we told the person at the desk of the restaurant that breakfast was already paid for he was very argumentative and did not apologise for their mistake when we pointed it out.  It was all very disappointing with complete lack of customer service so if you intend booking this hotel get a guarantee that no private functions will be taking over the hotel because you will be treated very badly.,1,2018,05,25
119,Fantastic stay,"I'd never been on a yacht before, let alone stay on one
We loved it!!!
The food was amazing as was the customer service. The room was devine - will definitely stay again.
A real gem smack bang next to the LondonExcel, location could not be more perfect",5,2018,05,25
119,1st Anniversary ,"For our first anniversary we stayed at the Sunborn ... went to the O2 to see Nickelback. 

Great location , very good transport links ... and we delighted to see it mounted as we approached it for the first time . 

Pleasant staff ... lovely room . 

Definitely stay here again ... ",4,2018,05,24
119,Fantastic hotel on the docks,"We stayed in an executive King room with a river view, with it's own balcony.  The entrance foyer is quite something with crystal chandelier and staircase, very stylish.  The view from the yacht is fantastic, the room is spacious, with a comfortable king size bed, with good quality linen and plenty pillows.  There is a sofa and coffee table, television, bar and walnut finish shelves and Lavazza coffee machine.  The bathroom is small as to be expected, with a shower, toilet and basin. Large towels, bathrobes and slippers available. Gorgeous Molton Brown toiletries.  Check in very friendly reception, and very welcoming. Also has great air conditioning, which is often rare in London.

We went out to a concert at the 02 so did not have dinner there.  After the concert we had a few cocktails in the Sundown bar.  The only let down was that of the 3 whiskeys on the menu, they only had one, and also sadly no drambuie, but the service was still very friendly and not intrusive.

Breakfast in the Lands End restaurant from 7-11:00 very civilised.  We were seated near the window with a lovely view of the water, unfortunately we could not go out on the deck as it had rained overnight.  Breakfast was a continental and hot buffet and all very well prepared.  Good coffee too.  I travelled by train from London to Custom House and a short 3-4 minute walk to the hotel, and my husband drove through and parked 3 minutes walk away at Royal Victoria car park, so easy to get to on public transport and by car.",4,2018,05,22
119,The Jewel of the Docks,"Stayed in the Sunborn over the weekend, having travelled down to London for a show at the Excel.  The yacht has the wow factor with attention to detail all around.  We had an executive room overlooking the docklands.  Spacious room, nice complimentary touches including use of coffee pod machine.  Outside seating deck areas to have drinks and soak up the sunshine.  Ate in the Al la Carte restaurant in the evening and the food was delicious.  The Sunborn is literally at the western entrance to the Excel and close to other restaurants and amenities such as the Emirate Cable Car. Will definitely be returning to stay here.",5,2018,05,21
119,Lovely experience,"We stayed in an executive room river side view which I'd definitely advise lovely views , the room didn't really have a wow factor for me for the price we paid but was nice for a one night stay.. we ate in the lands end restaurant which we could not have been more impressed with ,from the second we stepped in the staff were amazing so attentive we both had the steak and it was delicious we were very impressed.
We had a drink in the bar below lovely views of London at night on the outside deck was an overall and excellent experience.
The only thing I think i would add was if there were a dress code in keeping with status of the yacht, the majority of people eating dinner  had made an effort to dress up and was a shame to see a few tables of people sitting in shorts and flip flops .. just a bit of a let down on the beautiful setting.",5,2018,05,20
119,Lovely place,"We had been at Sunborn Yacht on Tuesday for a dinner. IT was our first time when we visited this hotel. Lovely place and good service.The staff were helpful and friendly, especially Axenia, she  met us at the reception area and looked after us during the dinner.The food also was delicious,great experience.Will be back definitely.",4,2018,05,17
119,“Perfect” is too small of a word. ,"Recently checked out of this beautiful hotel and I must say, the whole stay was perfect. It was clean, refreshing and professional. 

I would most recently recommend this hotel to anyone who wants to use it as a base for travelling around London, and I will certainly be visiting again!,",5,2018,05,16
119,A fantastic hotel in a beautiful setting,"I had the pleasure of staying at the Sunborn Yacht a couple of weeks ago and not knowing what quite to expect I must say I was blown away. 
The accommodation is suprisingly spacious with all the mod cons you'd come to expect in a luxury hotel and with a fabulous view overlooking the Thames.
The event spaces are perfect for a smaller meetings and events and they also have some fantastic terraces that you can enjoy for a private event or when visiting privately. Although on a boat there are some stunning and quirky art pieces throughout the boat. We had an amazing dinner in the restaurant, the food was absolutely delicious. But what makes this such a fabulous place is the outstanding service especially from Laszlo Jacab in the restaurant he simply could not do enough for us. So a big thank you to the sales manager Ajay Sampla and his wonderful team for giving us such a fantastic welcome and stay. I highly recommend this property both for leisure guests as well as corporate events and I for one can't wait to return!",5,2018,05,15
119,Dinner & Overnight Stay,"My first time visit to the Sunborn Yacht hotel was surprisingly delightful. The Ambience of the hotel was so luxury and the staff made our experience so pleasant. Our dining experience was excellent and made even more welcoming by our service from Laszlo, we felt we had a personal waiter who looked after our every need and we had a sneaky pic with him after dinner. The rooms are comfortable and very quite, and breakfast in the morning was plentiful and added luxury of ordering what we wanted! I would highly recommend this hotel for a visit or a special occasion.. you will be defiantly pampered by the staff !!",5,2018,05,14
119,Engagement Party,"Such a fabulous location made even more memorable by the first class service offer by the Sunborn team. My partner and I are so grateful for all their hard work, support and impeccable attention to detail which made our big day so special. Organising such a complex event with an events suite, multiple guest rooms, to the catering, everything was expertly orchestrated with the utmost care and professionalism. Thank you so much! ",5,2018,05,12
119,Champagne bar closed!,"Having checked the opening times and traipsed half way across London, we were looking forward to a few glasses of fizz in the Laurent Perrier Champagne bar. 

Having located a receptionist to help us, she pointed us in the direction of the Champagne bar, and off we went into the lift.

But a few floors up, when the lift doors opened, the bar was closed.

A huge disappointment after a monster journey from west London.

Wrote in only to receive a lack-lustre response. Even they didn’t know it was closed, or why.

Thankfully these lot don’t get to move the ship!",2,2018,05,12
119,Feels like 5 stars,Great experience and accommodation. It was my second time staying here and I will do again as the service was pleasant and the overall atmosphere made it feel like 5-stars even though it's technically 4.,5,2018,05,12
119,What a find!,"We had been to an exhibition at the Excel Arena and did not want any of the many utilitarian high street chains on offer. Having seen the boat moored in the docks over to the side we went to see if there was a restaraunt. The indoor restaraunt was beautifully appointed, like any cruise ship, but on a sunny day we chose to eat outside on the aft deck. We could have been on a cruise! The cuisine was excellent and the set lunch menu very affordable, and we were not with the madding crowds. Interesting views over the docks and Dockland and to top it all our waitress,Salomey joined in our 'joie de vivre' and made the whole experience enjoyable. Whenever we are in this part of London again, this will be our first port of call!",5,2018,05,11
119,60th Birthday Celebrations,"I cannot recommend this hotel enough. Myself and three friends visited for my special birthday and from the moment we arrived to the moment we left everything was perfect. The the front of house staff were friendly, helpful and courteous and nothing was too much trouble. The accommodation was spacious and clean in our river view rooms. We had spa treatments and my beautician Reagan was excellent. All the food we sampled, including lunch in the bar, a la carte dinner and champagne afternoon tea was of a very high standard, beautifully presented, tasty and very fresh. I'd also like to give a mention to Salomey who served us with afternoon tea - she was particularly lovely and looked after us very well so a big thank you to her. My friends and I all agree that this is somewhere we will definitely visit again. Thank you Sunborn!!",5,2018,05,11
119,Beautiful hotel ,"Hotel was beautiful 
Something different and lovely to sit on the deck and have a drink 
Staff were fab and room clean 
Good location using the cable car to get to the 02 
Lovely stay ❤️☀️
Few nice places for food near by and well worth the drive ",5,2018,05,10
119,A brief interlude,"Although I have stayed here, I took my sister to see the inside of the vessel.  It was middle of the afternoon so we had a snack in the bar looking out over the stern down river and the cable car over the river.  On a hot weekday afternoon, it was very pleasant to sit and relax and watch the world go by.",4,2018,05,09
119,Just perfect ! ,"I was lucky enough to be treated by my daughter to stay at the Sunborn London for my 60th birthday celebrations . 
Well it was all just perfect , fantastic accommodation , with the most stylish surroundings .
But more important than this was the continuous 1st class service we both received from the moment we entered the yacht , starting with reception which to customers is very much first impressions that stay with you , a warm greeting with helpful information and a very fast and easy check in . Lots of eye contact with genuine smiles ...... excellent customer service ! 
The stay truly made my celebrations memorable , everyone we met and passed always greeted us with Good morning etc and again lovely smiles.  Although all the staff were excellent would like to say a massive Thank you to a lady that served us our afternoon tea , Salomey , she was so friendly and professional,  and went that extra mile to make sure everything was perfect . I really appreciated that , please pass on my appreciation to her if possible.  
I have already shared my wonderful time on board to friends and family and will continue to recommend this wonderful time we had on the Sunborn . 
Well done to everyone , Thank you and keep up the well appreciated hard work.  ",5,2018,05,08
119,OVERNIGHT IN LONDON,"Where else can you spend the night on a 4 star ship 3 course meal for that money>Cabin was very large with everything you need
Would go back again another time.
Only down side drinks at bit expensive at the bar
",5,2018,05,08
119,Just ok,The room was of a good size. It only had a port hole which you cannot open. The bed was a good size. There was a shower and nice toiletries it was very clean. Its next to the Excel centre so a good distance from central London. There is a limited evening menu which was very expensive but there are restaurants nearby. I think the cheapest wine is £30.00. The staff at breakfast were very nice but the breakfast itself was abysmal. I had always wanted to stay at the Sunborn yacht hotel but unfortunately I was very disappointed and would not stay again or recommend my friends to stay.,3,2018,05,08
119,Love this hotel,"Stayed here again last night second time we have stayed, got a bigger room than last time and everything was perfect as before. Staff are really friendly and helpful only thing different was no nuts/snacks with our drinks in the bar but won't stop me coming back!",5,2018,05,07
119,Beautiful bank holiday surprise ,"My husband booked as a surprise for me, stunning yacht and interior. Very clean and spacious, enjoyed drinks on deck in the glorious sunshine. Food was good, service was sometimes a little slow at the bar. Overall though it was a fantastic stay, will be recommending to our friends and family ",5,2018,05,07
119,"Friendly staff, good food, clean and exciting","We stayed one night as we were visiting Excel. The yacht hotel was amazing and only a few minutes walk to Excel. Our room was lovely, large and looking onto the water. Very comfortable bed. The quality of the rooms, attention to detail, staff, everything was outstanding. We would recommend it.",5,2018,05,07
119,Luxury yacht with some nautical decor.,"This hotel offers 5-star service and cleanliness. It's a great place to relax and view the river. It's a perfect getaway with great transport links into the city. There staff were friendly and helpful, we want to give special thanks to Lency, our breakfast host.",5,2018,05,06
119,Very average,"Stayed here for friends birthdays did not live up to expectations at all . Cabin was nice enough nothing special though ! 
Loud loud music from a wedding being held on the ship that was so loud in the restaurant eventually after much begging they turned down . In the bar as far as the reception was concerned it was perfectly ok for a group to bring in a takeaway Chinese and eat it after we had spent over £300 on a meal in there restaurant!
We have travelled a lot and never have I heard such rot !!  
Very disappointed will not recommend.",2,2018,05,06
119,"Excellent, will see me again.","Nice location, excellent service and overall good quality room. Room with a better view was preferable but it's alright. Stay was very good would've been better if the weather was good too. Will definitely come back. ",4,2018,05,04
119,Perfect Stay,"The second time I've stayed at the hotel, the whole experience was perfect. 1000000% perfect. The staff were amazing, the bed was so comfy. I would recommend this to anyone who wants to make an occasion extra special. ",5,2018,05,03
119,Amazing experience!,"Stayed here as a family of 4. Was definitely a really good experience, the kids absolutely loved the idea of a yacht hotel. Staff were friendly and room was very clean and spacious. Didn't eat at the restaurant but the bar had a lovely atmosphere on the evening. Reception area is beautiful and makes the perfect backdrop for a photo. Room service was also quick and easy to use. We parked close bu in the victoria car park amd left our car there for the night. It was our 1st time to London and we managed to get into central London via tubes easily enough. Would definitely stay again 😊😊",5,2018,05,02
119,Unique stay in a convenient location.,"We had a very pleasant stay. The cabin size was generous, clean and comfortable. We had a seaview room with a little balcony.  Nice Molton Brown products in the bathroom and a decent coffee machine. The evening meal included in the package was of very good quality and beautifully presented. The staff were friendly. personable and professional. We had the good fortune to see an amazing sunset so do try and get a window table. I thought it was a little over the top to charge service on drinks ordered at the bar, but overall a very nice stay. I did find the communication difficult when calling before arrival to check details. Phone was not answered promptly and I didn't sometimes feel confident my requests had been taken on board even though in fact they were. Staff once on board were helpful and professional. The location is good with the DLR station just a few minutes walk from the boat- get off at Customs House station. Nice boat allows you to leave luggage there so you can go off and explore. Thank you.         ",4,2018,05,02
119,Visit to excel,"Very very nice ! 
Excellent welcome lovely room but it’s not cheap ! 

Did not eat but all looks very good ! 
Staff are all very polite ! 

Great location for Excel but it it is remote ! 
There are a couple of bars near and a few restaurants but your 40 mins from town ? 
",5,2018,05,01
119,Afternoon tea in the restaurant,"Went here for afternoon tea for a surprise baby shower for my friend. Prices are £27 (vegetarian) to £30/35 (including meat) depending on which option you choose. Plus more for champagne afternoon tea.

The way it works is everyone can choose which afternoon tea you want, so it doesn't matter if you all want different things, or if there's only one vegetarian. (Although they did put veggie sandwiches next to the meat ones). 

The actual sandwiches weren't that great, some were a bit soggy, others felt a bit stale - like they had been made hours earlier and kept in a fridge. Cakes were also a bit average but scones were tasty! You can have as much tea as you can drink too. 

Although the food wasn't as nice as I had expected, the staff were exceptional. Our waitress was a delight and so were all the other staff we came in contact with. We asked if a staff member could take a photo and she did a full on photo shoot by the main stairs/chandelier and we were all in hysterics. Staff really made the effort which was nice. 

It was good fun going on the yacht and you could watch other boat life on the river!",4,2018,04,30
119,A different kind of hotel,"We really enjoyed our stay. I booked it due to the novelty of staying on a yacht for the evening as a treat for my partner’s birthday! Our room was upgraded to one with a balcony which was nice, and the bed was huge and comfortable. The bathroom was clean with a good shower but on the small side and not as stylish as you might expect of a ‘fancy’ hotel. 
We had drinks in the bar in the evening and watched the sun set across the city which was beautiful. There was no table service but then we were charged for service when I paid the bill on check-out, so would have expected better service in general had I known as the drinks were not cheap!
Overall, I enjoyed the stay. We arrived by cable car too which added to the novelty factor and had good tapas in a restaurant across the road for dinner. If there is nothing on at the Excel then I think it’s reasonable value for money to stay here. ",4,2018,04,29
119,Anniversary treat,"Our anniversary stay was faultless! Beautiful surroundings and the Yacht is grand but definitely a 4 star hotel.
We stayed in an Executive Room which was nice but not overly grand. There is no information book in the rooms advising on amenities, restaurants, in room dining options and costs etc or how to work the in room tablet etc which would be helpful.
The tv is just Freeview no cable, Sky or any extras for those who want or need it.
We had the 3 course set meal for dinner which was very filling and good value for money at £35pp. The cocktails were good average cost £13 and the wines were okay with the cheapest ones costing £28-32!!!
Breakfast was faultless, lots to choose from and was included in our booking.
It would be a bonus if the Yacht were to have some evening entertainment such as a cinema/casino/Cabernet etc on board to give guests a ""feel"" of being at sea!
I would recommend to others and look forward to visiting again.",4,2018,04,27
119,Afternoon tea,"Fabulous afternoon tea sitting in the sunshine being served by friendly professional staff. Freshly made sandwiches and cakes washed down by tea and champagne.
Our main waitress Sami was amazing and really made our anniversary special by providing  chocolate piping on a plate with friend saying Happy Anniversary at very short notice.
Will definitely be back, it was amazing.",5,2018,04,26
119,Beautiful setting for a special occasion! ,"Booked to go here for joint birthdays, great value for money, considering the setting, location and quality of accommodation!
Rooms were large enough to entertain before going out for dinner.
Beds were very comfortable, and because it is in a dock there is no tidal movement. 5 mins walk from DLR and Emirates cable car taking you straight to the O2 Arena! Breakfast was good quality, and plenty of choice! ",5,2018,04,26
119,Fantastic Find!,"We stayed at the Sunborn because we were attending a show at the Excel centre. We had a lovely room with a river view, which was clean and spacious. The bathroom was larger than expected. All the staff we interacted with were friendly and we could not fault the service. We tried out the bar which was comfortable and reasonable too. We will be recommending to friends and we will be definitely staying again!",5,2018,04,25
119,Different but in a good way,"This was our first visit to this hotel simply because we had an really early flight out of LCY and didn't fancy the other hotel offering around the airport and it was worth it and would definitely use again, Suite was big and spacious and had a great sleep, rooms were clean, nice bathroom too, staff friendly and helpful.  We used the restaurant on board and again it didn't disappoint great food and great wine selection, a very enjoyable stay and would recommend and will use again, Many thanks",5,2018,04,25
119,Wonderful afternoon tea ,"Took my friend for afternoon tea and we had a lovely time. In particular one member of staff stood out - Salomey - who made sure we had a good time. She was v attentive and took good care of us, particularly in light of my dietary requirements due to my pregnancy.  A nice way to spend a sunny day in London. ",5,2018,04,21
119,Fancy yacht hotel,Stayed at sunborn for my birthday night last year. Loved that they maintained the decor of the yacht. You definitely get the feel of staying at a ship then you remember you're in a hotel. Not too impressed with the restaurant though.  But the rooms are just cute. ,4,2018,04,19
119,Treat for the mother in law,"Treated the mother in law for her birthday as she has always wanted to stay here and we where not disappointed, I’d also ordered a bottle of champagne for the room everyone was so so helpful, and my mother in law was over the moon with it great experience.",5,2018,04,18
119,Hubby's suprise 60th treat... the ,"What a grand place... Excellent views of London. Close to the O2 via cable car.
The rooms were spacious & a bed to die for. All the staff were very professional especially ELISE... She was really lovely.
The food was exquisite, pricey but worth it...!! In all a great day & night.",5,2018,04,17
119,Excellent Location for drinks,"This was a stop for pre dinner drinks, what a lovely stop, very nice comfortable, casual atmosphere. Very nice people, staff. The decor was just perfect. I would recommend a stop, not a great deal to do in the area. Great for Excel centre and obviously DLR for central London. Parking is reasonable at the IBIS hotel £5 an hour, possibly the cheapest in the area. Views from the deck bars are of the dock and local housing, but it just great. Ideal for a couple of drinks in the summer. Drinks £14 for two!",5,2018,04,15
119,Unique peaceful hotel,"When exiting Royal Victoria follow signs for Excel, and Sunborn is just a few minutes' walk away from the station. On arrival you have to get in a lift to get to reception and you'll need to look for floor 3. 

The rooms are really quite large and well equipped. They provide you with Molton Brown body wash, shampoo and conditioner plus soap but no body lotion. Shower caps and vanity kits are provided. There is a hairdryer in the bathroom. You have to make sure that you press the red button to start it (this is on the left hand side of the base). There are lots of drinks facilities in the room including complementary still and sparkling water, a Lavazza coffee making machine, a variety of teas and Cadbury hot chocolate (wine glasses and tumblers are in the room). You will have a few biscuits too. There is also a safe in the wardrobe. Had a very quiet night's sleep and we are both light sleepers. There is a general hum in the room at night but this caused no issues. The room has lots of mirrors but they're all rose tinted but for the bathroom and so you may want to ensure you bring your own compact mirror along if you'd like to do make-up in natural light.

Tip: pay extra for the rooms facing the river!

We had drinks out on the deck and also we ate in the restaurant. The service on the deck was quite slow and a little bit inexperienced but the drinks were good. In the restaurant the service was good and the food was delicious. It is pricey but for a one-off it's fine and the food is generally worth it although £12 for a sticky toffee pudding is a little steep. We didn't have breakfast here as this was about £20 per person which we thought was too much. There are places within a couple of minutes that have far better value breakfasts. The responses from the hotel on this point generally state that it's justified being a novelty experience and comparable with other 4 star hotels in London but not quite sure I agree. There is a Tesco Express between the hotel and Royal Victoria Station if you want to pick up any provisions. The Emirates cable car is about £8-9 pp return and is about a 5 minute walk away.

Overall a unique stay and very relaxing away from the hustle and bustle. On a nice day it is very pleasant sitting out on the deck which is sheltered from the wind. Lovely rooms and a very nice welcome from reception. We would definitely consider staying here again.

",4,2018,04,15
119,Quirky and luxurious hotel within close proximity of the O2,"The Sunborn is the perfect place to stay if you are going to the O2. It is quirky, quite luxurious and convenient for central London. The staff we encountered were very helpful and the accommodation was extremely comfortable.",5,2018,04,14
119,"Decent price, great place to stay","Lovely room, great staff, a really different place to stay! £20 per person for breakfast is a bit pricey but still a great hotel, would come again. Nice Molton Brown toiletries too. Not too far from central london either",5,2018,04,14
119,Mid week break,"Sunborn yatch
Fantastic couple of days away relaxing, and enjoying the scenery, food was excellent,staff were very attentive, we will revisit with family and friends around the summer time so we can enjoy drinks on outside terrace.",5,2018,04,13
119,Business trip,A very unusual experience. Everything was very enjoyable. I thought very good value for money and in a very good location. I am used to staying in hotels on business and this was far more interesting !,5,2018,04,13
119,Fabulous,Such a great novel idea and makes you feel very special.  The bed was huge and soooo comfortable.  Amazing nights sleep.  Very quiet and peaceful.  Stayed after an event at the 02.  Arrived via the Emirates cable cars which are just a few minutes walk away.  Two tube rides from the 02.  Not as convenient as staying next door but the difference in price was unbelieveable.  Courteous staff.  Look forward to our next stay!,5,2018,04,12
119,Great Experience.,"Decided to try the Sunborn hotel in London’s docklands for a change and we were quietly surprised by the experience. Rooms were nice and well presented, had a balcony room over looking the quay area.
Breakfast was a well served hot buffet option with plenty of choice.
Only one small negative was the surcharge added at the bar for the bartender to serve you drinks!",5,2018,04,11
119,"Nice stay,","We stayed here last night. We paid an extra £10 to have a riverside room which is well worth doing as it helps with the theme of the boat. being on a boat and looking at concrete buildings on the other side wouldn't be too exciting i can imagine. 

The room was very spacious and clean, watch the step into the bathroom though. We had a shower not a bath but that was ok. we were directly below a flight path but never heard anything at all.

We didn't have breakfast but we were offered an upgrade to a room with a balcony for £50 which included breakfast, we politely declined.

We had dinner and breakfast down the road as the menu at the yacht only had 4 items to choose from.

I don't know if i would stay again but was a nice novelty, and quiet location. Was a nice stay, would recommend though.",4,2018,04,10
119,Lovely ,Went here for my husband 50th birthday  reception very polite and helpful  went to our room which was on the river side rooms are large very clean beds lovely and soft tea coffee kettle all there for you also had fridge tv iron and board lovely clean bathroom well worth the money and only 5-10 minutes walk to the emirates cable car to the o2 will be booking up again ,5,2018,04,09
119,Great Hotel/Yacht in nice quiet spot,"This was a refreshing change just far enough outside on central London to be quiet but close enough th all modes of transport to able to get anywhere with ease. It was a lovely experience and everywhere was just how you would expect to find it in this class of hotel, the staff could not have been friendlier we will certainly go again",5,2018,04,09
119,Couples overnight stay,"Great to stay somewhere a little different.  The hotel (boat) is docked right next to the Excel with few restaurants surrounding it.

We were lucky to have a nice sunny day so sat outside and drank a bottle of wine and had a couple of bar snacks which was lovely. 

We stayed in room 2046 which was very clean and spacious and the bed was so incredibly comfortable. 

A couple of things lacking which made it feel like an average stay. 
There was no dressing table in the room which meant putting make up on in the bathroom. This may be a minor point but I have never stayed anywhere without somewhere to sit and do make up (even a Premier Inn) 

Making a coffee in the morning was stressful and ended up not being able to have one. There was a coffee machine in the corner but no plug socket by it which was really strange!  Discovered only one plug socket in the whole room so had to cart the coffee machine over to the corner.     We then found that the coffee machine wasn't working (informed the cleaner on our way out) and so put the coffee machine back in the other corner and then moved the kettle tray over to the corner with the one plug socket to boil the kettle and make a cup of tea in a minature cup.   This felt quite disappointing and we were desperate for a coffee.

Something else to note is there was no information folder in the room which is the first time I have experienced this and we had no idea what time check out was.  We just checked out at about 9.30 as we just wanted to go and get a cup of coffee.

We didn't eat in the restaurant, and didn't have breakfast so unable to comment on that. 

A nice pleasant stay and I think I will be back to try the afternoon tea but the hotel stay didn't wow me.",3,2018,04,06
119,Helpful staff and Nice Interior,"We like to just relax and be on a boat, as we love boats. It was a nice, calming atmosphere. International bar staff helpful and friendly. Lovely views of the Docks from the terrace. Coffees are about £4 each or so, but you kind of expect that. It felt like a traditional gentleman's Club, in the bar, although women would feel comfortable going there too. I think it could do with some flowers though. The guests we saw there were quiet, and not drunk and rowdy which was nice to see However, there were some noisy and unruly children, not being supervised by their parents there, who were running around and treating the place like a playground It is not really a place for ill mannered children.",5,2018,04,03
119,Fantastic Overnight stay,"We stayed here on Easter Sunday for my birthday and had a fantastic stay.  We had an executive room with a balcony (dockside view), I really can't fault the hotel or our room (4th floor, although river view would have been nicer), bed was so comfy, bathroom and shower were great, balcony had two chairs out so we could sit out (despite the poor weather, the balcony is covered).  We didn't end up having dinner in the restaurant so can't comment on that as we went over to the O2 to meet friends for a drink. The reception area is stunning, and the room furnishings are really nice and give you the 'yacht' feel, despite there being no movement!. There was a lovely large mirror which made the room feel more spacious. The heating was excellent, I was worried about being cold being on the river but the settings are controlled via thermostat. This was a romantic stay, and I would definitely recommend this to couples, although I am sure it gets very busy when ExCel is open.  We went to the Fox pub a few mins walk away which did a great breakfast.  
 
It was pretty quite around the area, but there is a small Tesco, some small restaurants and if you go across to the O2 via the emirates cable car there is plenty to do. I would definately recommend for an unusual romantic getaway - you will not be disappointed.",5,2018,04,03
119,Amazing Yacht ,"The Sunborn London Yacht is an amazing experience. 1st Class all the way. We had the pleasure of the Executive Suite. It was clean, tidy and the best room onboard. Equipped with its own spa facilities this room is luxurious and good value.
The location is excellent for the O2 and other London sights.
",5,2018,04,02
119,Lovely hotel ,"Love the hotel - interior is nice. Our room was huge with a balcony and we were upgraded. Comfy and clean. Friendly staff around the hotel and at checkin/checkout. Very close to Excel, DLR to connect to the city is within sight and there are few restaurants around!
Would like to definitely go back!",4,2018,04,02
119,Amazing,"This place is amazing, just outside the centre, so a bit of a journey, shame it’s on the flight path of one of London’s airports but with the door closed you can’t hear anything, stunning room, great staff and the views from the deck are fantastic, breakfast was nice, great choice of foods, lovely place for a night away.",5,2018,04,02
119,"Fantastic stay, huge comfortable room and 15 mins to hustle and bustle!","We absolutely loved this hotel, the hotel looks impressive from the moment you see it!
The reception area is beautiful and continues to wow you!
Our room was a standard river view room which was enormous! It was fantastic!
I am a big coffee fan so to find an espresso machine was a huge thumbs up!
Cannot fault the hotel at all, we loved it!
Sadly didn't get to use restaurant as was out of our price range, two drinks in bar cos £20 hi h we were a little shocked by.
If you want a hotel close to London but without the suffocating tiny rooms you get for high prices, stay here!! 
We parked at the Excel center for the 36 hours we were staying so didn't even pay train fares etc just Dlr/tube.
We even got a lovely letter ishing us a happy anniversary high was a great little touch.
Love love loved it!!",5,2018,04,01
119,Nice Experience ,The restaurant had great views on the river Thames. This a lovely experience to take in London. We stayed aboard the yacht too. The rooms have highly polished walnut furniture. Very clean. You can stand outside your room. A tiny balcony but still a balcony. The food was good. The staff were attentive. You can go for drinks too. On a nice day you can sit outside and take food and drinks. Park in the ncp in the Royal docks about £12 for the day. Well worth a visit. ,5,2018,04,01
119,Lovely hotel,"Stayed in the hotel for one night and found it to be a lovely place to relax - close enough for our commute with the rooms really clean and comfortable - the only niggle I have is that we were told we would get an upgrade if available - the hotel was relatively quiet and no upgrade was ever mentioned and also the website advertised a 20% discount at the bar and this was never given. Also be aware local parking is now £20 for 24 hrs and not £15 as advertised. 
Overall a lovely place to stay. ",5,2018,03,31
119,Catch up time with my daughters/business,"I booked this because thinking it was going to be a high class hotel and exactly near The Excel for my business trip/Mother's Day catch up with my daughters.I was totally let down with my executive room,walking in after checking in omg! The overwhelming smell of stale smoke was unbearable spoke to the front desk and they sent a women around spraying freshener around me as I stood there choking I have asthma so had to go outside for ten minutes.me,They only informed me at check about the private party as the pose level was quote loud on checking,but when we sat have a very expensive not so great meal the noise from the disco was over bearing so much so we could not hear our self speaking to each other.
Breakfast each day extra £20 was always tepid and one waiter constantly chewing chewing gum yuk!",2,2018,03,30
119,Noisy and dated.,"Once in the room, you could be in any noisy hotel. Although the rooms are spacious and the bed was comfortable, they are dated and mine was not that clean. My request for a quiet room was ignored and I ended up next to a room party that started at 3am and continued until 6am. The walls are very thin and the whole place shudders when doors are shut or people walk overhead. When I arrived, a very drunk man was at the bar and was being served shots. An hour later when I went to the bar for a hugely expensive drink, he was still there. Breakfast is not included and weighs in at rip off £20. I normally stay at the Novotel next door but saw this and was intrigued. A poor night’s sleep and no breakfast means I will be returning to the Novotel. Needless to say, I wasn’t asked about my stay at checkout and the management response to my account stay was a vague platitude, which reflects the general lack of interest evident in pretty much all the service I experienced.",2,2018,03,30
119,Amazing gluten free afternoon tea,"What a lovely afternoon at the Sunborn.
Great view looking out onto Thames and watching the cable cars.
Splendid afternoon tea - best gluten free scones ever.
Thanks go to the lovely Salomey who looked after us.
Must visit if you are GF.
",4,2018,03,30
119,Wonderful stay with great service and unique setting,"We stayed on the Sunborn for one night while attending a trade event at the Excel. I have to say it far exceeded my expectations and was a lovely break from conferencing hotels. The room was large and pristine with comfy bed, great coffee macine,  bathrobe and slippers and molten brown toileteries. Good free wifi was available in the room. A lovely view accross the river made it feel like a holiday rather than a business trip. The service throughout the hotel was excellent and we enjoyed a lovely breakfast with a view. Special mention to the standard of housekeeping, everything was absolutely spotless. Would definitely stay again if I needed to be in this part of London and highly recommend.",5,2018,03,27
119,Luxurious stay,"We had an amazing weekend, even if it was just for the night. The room felt luxurious and I loved our balcony, just a shame it was too cold to sit outside and amire the amazing view of the city and O2 lit up. It would be nice to be a bit closer towards central London however as we were only a 15min walk from the nearest tube we weren't isolated. I would highly recommend staying here and will most definitely be returning.",5,2018,03,27
119,Afternoon Tea,"We had an Under the Sea Afternoon Tea at the Sunborn Yacht for my daughters birthday.
The staff could not do enough for us, the food was delicious & the setting was amazing. The waitress was so lovely & even organised a birthday cake & candle. ",5,2018,03,24
119,Birthday treat,I won at a charity ball an all inclusive 1 night voucher to stay on the yacht. It was positioned fabulously so you could see the city airport and the planes flew once at 6 and again at 9 next morning. Otherwise it was so quiet and peaceful with no traffic noise and we had a fab view overlooking the the water and it felt really private. We were given an up grade to the yacht executive room on same floor as restaurant. Treated my other half birthday treat surprise with complimentary champagne in room followed by a delicious dinner in restaurant looking over towards the London skyline. You could see most of the famous landmarks. There was a stunning deck to look out over the water and staff very friendly. The bed was super king size and very comfortable. Super shower and loads of extras in the room. Excellent cooked breakfast with large variety of continental range and again with a good view. Really interesting boat and is worth looking at hiring the upstairs venues for parties. We left the yacht and headed home over the Emirates Skyline cable car ride literally 5 mins walk away. ,5,2018,03,24
119,Lap of luxury!,"Stayed here as part of my wife's 60th birthday treat. And I'm glad we did. The ship is amazing! From the chandelier-ed reception area complete with two sweeping staircases leading up to the restaurant, to the spacious and luxurious cabins, to the ornate bar, everything made you feel you were living the high-life!  Will certainly book again!",5,2018,03,22
119,Afternoon Tea at the Sunborn,"Having stayed at the Gibraltar Sundorn & dined there on several occasions, including Christmas Day, we thought it would be nice to see how the London Sunborn compares.
We were not disappointed - the location, decor & friendly, helpful staff are all on a par with there ""big brother""in Gibraltar.
We had a reserved table in the very pleasant restaurant with a view across the Thames towards the O2 Centre
We had a fabulous afternoon tea, indulging in the ""Under the Sea with champagne"" menu with a delicious selection of sandwiches, cakes, scones & preserves. 
We received superb service from our very friendly and helpful waitress Salomey, who really pampered us and tended to our every needs instantly. Very impressive service from this delightful young lady.
A very enjoyable afternoon experience, we would not hesitate to dine there again.",5,2018,03,21
119,Lovely and clean ,"Can’t fault this hotel, was lovely and clean and the staff were really nice, bed was so comfortable, would definitely recommend this place. I will use it again. Never got the chance to try out the massage or other treatments.",4,2018,03,21
119,Family weekend break,"Closest we'll probably get to staying on a super yacht. Fantastic accommodation, spotlessly clean, fantastic staff. A really great place to stay as long as you don't mind a short trip into the centre of London on the DLR. Great value ",5,2018,03,20
119,Different business venue ,"Booked it for a business meeting, great facilities including a boardroom and large auditorium. Food and bar good quality, staff attentive. Bedrooms are large and well appointed.

Only draw back is you have to use a lift from the outside to Reception. ",4,2018,03,20
119,Brilliant experience ,"What a lovely stay, from the welcome we got to the amazing room, we didn't eat here but had cocktails at the bar which were lovely would highly recommend staying here it's an amazing experience rooms are large and well equipt ",5,2018,03,17
119,Holiday,"We were here with the little child and be impressed by a friendly staff, good enviroment. Highely would recomend to everyone stay here. Very good food , big mirrrors in the room, nice views from room, would recomend bar with best views.",5,2018,03,16
119,Great accommodation ,"The Sunborn Yacht Hotel is one of the closest hotels to Excel London. As per the norm whenever a conference or exhibition is on at Excel you pay a premium for accommodation close by. 
Over the years we have stayed at most of the hotels in the vicinity of Excel.

The receptionist was very polite and friendly and check in was very quick. I had booked an executive room for my husband and I, plus a further three other rooms from the following day for the rest of the team.
The room was quite adequate, a small balcony with two chairs overlooking the dock. Plenty  of wardrobe space, a work space / dressing  table, TV, sofa and table. A very comfortable bed and a small bathroom with a shower. There was also a fridge with two bottles of water, a coffee machine and a kettle plus tea/coffee/etc. The room was very quiet and we never heard anyone passing by  in the corridor or any noise from the room above. 
Breakfast was buffet style served from 6-30. Plenty of choice, cold meats and cheeses, fresh fruit, cereals, yogurts, pastries,fresh rolls and bread. Also a hot buffet of sausages, bacon, beans,scrambled and fried eggs, mushrooms, tomatoes,and hash browns. Tea, coffee and juices.
We all said the breakfasts were great.
The bar was very nice and the drinks were typical London prices.
All very positive until we booked a table for dinner one evening.
To our surprise the hotel has a very limited menu. The special set course menu was exactly the same as the ordinary menu. One of our team is a vegetarian and also does not eat tomatoes. There was only three choices to start the meal and the vegetarian choice was tomato soup. Main course  was gnocchi in tomato sauce. I did ask the server if there was anything else our guest could have. She went to the kitchen and came back with the answer that the chef could do the gnocchi without the sauce but nothing else was available.
We travel a great deal and this is the first time that we have not dined in the hotel in the evening. 

We got up and walked out, we found a lovely small restaurant near by who couldn’t do enough to accommodate us their menu was appealing lots of choice and an awful lot cheaper.

In conclusion good accommodation with a great breakfast but the evening menu is more 2* it needs a revamp with a lot more choice especially when you can get a great meal close by at a fraction of the cost. We were not the only people who thought this. 

",4,2018,03,16
119,Lovely afternoon,"What an amazing place, booked spa treatments + afternoon tea to surprise my mom for her birthday and everything was spotless. Gabriele our waitress made everything extra special taking care of every small detail. We would definitely return to the Sunborn.",5,2018,03,15
119,40th Birthday treat,"when we arrived at the boat we were given a free room upgrade. The staff were very friendly and helpful.  The room was amazing, clean and comfortable.  the reason i have given a 4/5 for location is because its a good 40 minutes from the boat into central London on the tube.  i have given a 4/5 for value, this is because i feel its rather expensive for just one nights stay, but if your looking for something different than a hotel, then this is the place for you!",5,2018,03,14
119,Nice restaurant Excellent service,"Very well prepared dishes at a fair price !  Excellent service by Gabriela !!!

The Gravilax was very good and the Terrine exceptional.

The Hotel is located at a good place for those attending Excel.

The bar on the 4th deck is very good for business meeting.  ",5,2018,03,13
119,Perfect location for O2 concert,"Room was spacious and very clean 
Hotel just a few minutes away from London Luton 
Perfect for O2 concert via emirates cable car
Staff very friendly and professional 
Breakfast was good
And funny to be on a boat :) ",4,2018,03,13
119,Massage and afternoon Tea !,I had booked an afternoon massage and tea for my partners birthday present and what a great afternoon it was. Greeted by very friendly staff into a striking lobby with chandelier and staircase . Massage was wonderful and very relaxing . Highly recommend . Afternoon Tea was on the first floor overlooking the Thames and dock which was perfect on a sunny day !  We were served by Salomey who could not have done anymore for us. First class service and she even surprised my partner with a birthday desert . Top class service with a smile . Thanks !,5,2018,03,12
119,Business Trip on the Sunborn,"So, my company booked this to host some drinks for clients on.  Absolutely lovely stay.  Room was great, Lavazza coffee machines in the room was a great touch as I love my morning Espresso.  Molton Brown Shower products which I actually used unlike other hotels.  Overall a brilliant stay and the staff when hosting the drinks couldn't do enough for us.  Overall amazing and would go again!",5,2018,03,12
119,expensive sleepless night,room nice also very clean but very very warm could not sleep with the heat porthole type window did not open either complained to reception who said we could sleep in another room further down the corridor this room was a lot cooler but after a few minutes there was a continuos loud humming sound which was impossible to sleep so a sleepless night was had by both of us completely spoiling a otherwise nice stay would not go again for this reason,1,2018,03,08
119,Memorable Birthday Celebration,"It was worth travelling in the snow to visit The Sunborn Yacht Hotel for our Treatwell deal - winter exclusive champange afternoon tea including vitamin glow facial and back massage. We felt very relaxed after our treatments.

Despite the weather, the view from the restaurant where we have our afternoon tea was great. Salomey who served us was very friendly and attentive. I had a lovely surprise from Salomey and her colleagues singing happy birthday to me (luckily the place was not busy otherwise I really would be embarrassed)  and a special plate with a candle. The food was good.

An unforgettable experience. Thank you",4,2018,03,08
119,Amazing place!,"What an Amazing hotel, we were greeted at the hotel by Eva who was lovely and she answered all our questions. The room was super lovely, more than enough space and I have to say the room was super clean, totally spotless!! We went into the boat bar, £8.50 for a glass of prosecco but it was worth it as tasted so good! Will definitely come back here again soon. Thank you very much Sunbourn!",5,2018,03,06
119,"Superb, high class and quality.","Admittedly I had my eye on this place for a while. At time of booking it was actually cheaper then the ibis and plaza.
Booking was easy, pre welcome emails a few days before. When we got there the location is great 3 mins to DLR into London, city airport or canary wharf. The hotel is what you would expect from a yacht, very clean, classy and very welcoming, however it was the friendly staff that makes the place what it is, everyone from the recipient to the catering staff to the room cleaning staff were all very polite. Being in the heart of the docklands you are a little way out of London but the piece and quiet far makes up for it. A special not in the beds too, they are the most comfortable I have slept on.",5,2018,03,06
119,Christmas presant,What an absolute treat.beautiful location on the river.amazing company is all we needed.i would say the drinks are extremely expensive £35.00 ...1 glass red wine ..3 jack  daniels and splash diet coke..not impressed ..that could spoil the whole stay but lucky it didnt..,5,2018,03,05
119,Great location ,I stayed at the Sunborn yacht whilst on business in the area. The rooms are great and the views of the surrounding area and cable cars amazing. Breakfast was very good and the attitude of the staff also.,5,2018,03,05
119,Afternoon tea and spa.,"Wow, what an experience? Lovely, beautiful, well decorated hotel with friendly, helpful staff. Very relaxing atmosphere with a beautiful view. Enjoyed with friends the body massage and the tea.
Afterwards we went down to the lounge, spent some time there because we just could'nt leave. Definitely will go back in summer, it should be more interesting.",5,2018,03,04
119,Afternoon tea,"We visited the hotel for some anniversary treats and we can honestly say the service was brilliant. 
Elise and Salome were fantastic hosts at the restaurants . They looked after us and made sure we had a lovely time. 
The therapy rooms were lovely too.
Thank you for such brilliant service - we will be back shortly! ",5,2018,03,04
119,Ok for London but not central,"Visited the Sunborn after attending an award ceremony at the Excel. Location for the Excel can not be faulted as right out side.  Rooms nice and large and good bathroom and tea and coffee facilities.  The bar is very very expensive at £5 for a 330ml bottle of Peroni! I know it's London but felt ripped off.  The view from the bar is fab straight over canary wharf.  
The room was very stuffy at night even with the aircon on, we stayed in a classic room which has no opening Windows so if  you like fresh air make sure you get a more superior room.
There isn't much outside the hotel, one bar which was a bit soulless and again pricey due to captive audience.
If I visited London again would def stay in a more central hotel with places to eat and drink near by.",3,2018,03,04
119,Afternoon Tea,Had an amazing time celebrating my birthday at Sunborn London.  Our server Salomey went above and beyond.  Very helpful and attentive.  Will definitely be back.  The afternoon tea with fizz was worth a trip.  Felt very relaxed after our spa treatment.  What a fantastic way to spend the afternoon.,5,2018,03,04
119,A good experience. Stayed in January 2017.,"I can only comment on the room as we didn’t make much use of the facilities here. It was part of a present for my partner. 

The hotel staff we came into contact with were helpful and friendly and the rooms was clean and well kept after.

It was an experience to stay in luxury on the yacht and cannot fault the hotel at all.",4,2018,03,03
119,Underwhelming - romantic getaway package,"We bought a romantic getaway package to celebrate our birthdays, it was a pleasant experience, but underwhelming overall - attention to detail was missing which is typically what a boutique hotel stands out for.
There was no welcome drink on arrival neither a tray of chocolate in the room as the package description suggested. We did enquire about the drinks&chocolate at the reception at the checkout next day and they were sweet to apologise and promise to investigate, but this sort of kills the experience you pay for. 
Dinner and breakfast were included in the package, the food was delicious and beautifully presented (and a bargain for a set menu which is not very different at all from the a la carte), lovely service as well - we did enjoy! The bar was nice and quiet and cosy with a quick service. 
I also enjoyed a spa experience if you want to give it a go, just book in advance, the staff is lovely and treatments are plenty and fairly priced for London. 
The package included other perks like some discount off bar, food and spa bills, those weren't taken off the final bill - we had to remind. 
So a lovely experience overall, we weren't dissatisfied at all, but all the little mishaps added up to an average experience. I think it is definitely worth coming for dinner, afternoon tea and a spa and we will come back in summer to check out the upper deck bar in the sun, but the romantic getaway package isn't worth it, it's cheaper or same if you pay for all separately even including the £20pp breakfast.",3,2018,03,03
119,Great place and excellent service,"I was on Sunborn yacht in January (during the Bett) as a guest in the evening.
I would like to thank everybody whose working there so much. All of them were really friendly, nice and good customer services.

Specially one waitress was super. She had dark long hair with some blond in the ends. I would like to pass special thanks on her  - greetings and many thanks for a nice evening where she had a great part.

I´ve been in London for about 30 times - definitely next time will be on Sunborn Yacht!",5,2018,03,03
119,Lovely place,Very nice hotel I would advice paying more for a balcony much better views.  We found the bar and restaurant a bit expensive but there are plenty of bars locally.  Breakfast was superb and the hot choclate to die for,4,2018,03,03
119,Boyfriend birthday epic fail!,"Done a groupon for a nights stay with three course meal food was ok nothing special but our room was not very clean and shower was very dirty with stains on the walls. 

Wouldn’t recommend sorry but thank you for the experience hope this is taken on broad.",2,2018,03,03
119,Great hotel,"Having stayed at the Sunborn on a number of occasions for business, I know that I'll always get a well-appointed, clean, and maintained room. The rooms are very spacious and comfortable, and great when I need to get work done before heading to meetings.Hope to visit again soon.",5,2018,03,02
119,Fabulous stay,What a way to celebrate hubbys pre 50th birthday celebrations. Fantastic hotel. Amazing room with a view. Great service and friendly staff. Wish we could have stayed longer. 😉 will definitely be back! Thank you to all at sunborn London for making our stay so special. X  ,5,2018,02,27
119,"Needs fine tuning, and a little bit of business help to get it to run propperly","The room we had ( a suite with balcony ) was wonderfully big, clean and well stocked with all the trimmings. So much space. The rest of the hotel was also clean, bright and well looked after. Breakfast was very good. Views were beautiful. 
However, the two lifts are the only  way  onto the boat, and one was broken, so a que of 15 people were waiting outside in the cold to get onto the boat while it stopped at every single floor multiple times on the way down.I was there all weekend, it was broken on my arrival and was broken when I left. They also got an order wrong, when the waitress didn't actually listen to the order given adn instead of checking they had it right, just guessing.  Bit of a let down in that respect.",4,2018,02,26
119,Birthday Event,"Myself and my family were left extremely disappointed when booking a Suite to find the facilities were not functioning. This room was purely booked for the facilities available, and the yacht hotel because of the luxurious eligibility for my step daughters 7th birthday. We were informed after check in that the Jacuzzi was not working, it was felt a bath bomb or two would suffice as an alternative!!! Seriously... one of the showers had a temperature fault, and room service was delivered cold and with out cutlery. 
I don’t think this is a standard I would class as luxurious, it’s common practice to eat food with some form of cutlery of some description. Furthermore, I paid for certain facilities for the purpose of my step daughters delight, how do you even begin to explain to a child that the facility is not even available. Definitely not worth any amount of money in my opinion. Waiting to hear if the General Manager would like to feedback and explain why I have paid for something far below an acceptable standard.",1,2018,02,26
119,30th Birthday,"I booked an afternoon tea for my friends 30th birthday. We had a fantastic time and Salome are waitress was very helpful talking us through the menu and refilling our glass... I would recommend the afternoon tea to anyone who is having a birthday, as they made my friend feel very special with a chorus of happy birthday and a plate full of treats for her. It very good value for money in a beautiful venue with great views of London.",4,2018,02,24
119,AMAZING,"Was a lovely experience at the Sunborn, amazing hotel with great service especially by Salomey who was pleasant and very helpful. The views were amazing and the afternoon tea I had was exceptional would definitely recommend",5,2018,02,24
119,Nothing special,"The price you pay is for an okay room with no opening window. Although the experience of the yacht is advertised I wouldn’t have known I was on a yacht but for seeing the river out of the window.

We stayed in February and the room was roasting hot. We left the AC on lowest, 10 degrees c, for 5 hours whilst we went out for the evening and when we got back the room temperature was still at 25 degrees c. We had to move next door at 3.30am because the heat was unbearable. 

We paid Advanced Purchase rate of £109 for 2 night stay in a river view room on a Sunday. I managed to get this price by calling and booking direct and cancelling my booking.com room which was £170 for the same thing. When we arrived to check in they attempted to sell us, for the second time, a room with a balcony for an extra £70. We didn’t realise that refusal to upgrade meant we would be boiling hot all night in our standard room.

You don’t feel as though you are in a yacht when you can go on the outdoor part of the yacht, you can access the reception or your room. If you want to dine you can see the river from the restaurant but only indoors and the cost of the food is fairly pricey for what you get. Breakfast is a ridiculous £20 per person? This is the most I have ever seen at a hotel and I have stayed at much nicer places. My boyfriend and I weren’t prepared to pay £40 for a breakfast buffet.

I wouldn’t bother you can stay at much nicer places in London more centrally locates for the same price, don’t be drawn in by the fact the hotel is a yacht because you’ll be confined to your room.",1,2018,02,21
119,Late Valentine treat,"Stayed here for a late Valentine treat...all looked very good...really pleasant receptionist... paid £20 extra to have a room overlooking the water instead of looking out to the excel building...comfortable room,however,had to have the aircon on all night as it was very stuffy and there was no windows that could be opened for fresh air...tried to book a table for evening meal but was told fully booked... decided to have a stroll around the area and found a nice tapas bar/restaurant to get something to eat...went back to the yacht and decided to go to the bar...this is when it went wrong! Stood at the bar for 10mins only to realise it's table service,no information about this on the bar....sat down at a table near the bar...waited 25mins ,my husband manage to catch the waiters eye and ordered drinks..15mins later drinks arrived with an apology saying there is a wedding upstairs !? Ordered another 2 drinks , again ,very long wait for the drinks...its only that we saw our drinks sitting on the bar for a while that we asked the waiter are they ours that we got them ... We witnessed at least 8 couples and a large group of people leave the bar saying they cant be bothered to wait any longer for their orders to be taken.very very disappointed with the bar service...paid our bill and left.
Spoke to the receptionist in the morning about the bar service and she was very professional and apologetic about it...then was asked to settle our bar bill ..we explained we had paid...
We are still in correspondence with the company regarding this discrepancy. 
So fyi....book early for evening meal...like a week before and don't go to the bar if they have a wedding on and keep any receipts. 
",3,2018,02,19
119,"Lovely food, Missing breakfast","The food at the lands end restaurant was lovely , couldn't fault it!  The rooms were just as lovely, despite the missing tablet which had menu's for room service. With this missing, we decided to order breakfast the night before at reception for 9.30... next morning came and no breakfast. Called reception to ask where it had got to, they had no record and therefore no breakfast. Offered to take order then, but check out at 11 so declined.  Despite the very disappointing organisation of room service the overall stay was very pleasing and would recommend.",3,2018,02,18
119,Different experience,"Nice to stay somewhere different, a little way out but good connections to London.  Nice large room very clean and loved the Molton Brown shower gels in room.  Didn’t use the restaurant as a little pricey ",4,2018,02,17
119,Disappointing,"I’ve waited for to write this review as been waiting for a response from manager but have not received a response.

I stayed at the hotel first week in February. I was extremely annoyed that the boiler system was broke, and wasn’t told this at check in, so to my horror my partner and myself was unable to take a shower or have access to hot water. At the rate of £194 a night for a room. This is totally unacceptable, even the offer of a mediocre complimentary breakfast does not make up for the dissatisfaction of no running hot water. 
The room was very comfortable and I did enjoy my stay but cannot get over the problem with the lack of hot water. It just spoiled the whole experience. 

Location: brilliant, opposite Excel and close to DLR

Parking: multi-storey car park close by at £17 for 24hrs

Comfort: beds were probably most comfortable hotel bed I’ve ever slept in, we had the executive dock view room, which has a small balcony and spacious room. Could have had better pillows, and molton Brown bath products were dismal. 

Was offered complementary breakfast due to having no hot water, glad I didn’t have to pay, buffet style, but was Luke warm probably due to the lack of heating system, and temperature of dining room. 

Value for money: although this is a wonderful concept hotel, you’re paying for the concept of the yacht and location. Spent far less on much better rooms for the night, also fact that was unable to take a shower was a real disappointment.",2,2018,02,16
119,Great service,"The Sunborn is a little bit out of the way and awkward to get to in a car but worth the effort. We found the reception and restaraunt staff  courteous and helpful. We were looked after by Gabriella for our evening meal who was exceptionally pleasant, cheerful and helpful.

We had a minor issue with the plug in the bath but I am sure the problem would have been resolved had we asked, we had had a particularly stressful day so had had enough by then. The hotel room was spacious and exceptionally clean.",4,2018,02,16
119,A little bit of heaven ,"We stayed here for 2 nights with our 2 small children for out london advanture. We booked sunborn after a few days of looking for family rooms in central london and I can honestly say even given the distance I'd stay here any day over other more central hotels. I thought it was a pretty good bargain considering the quality of the place. 
Upon arrival we thought the boat was beautiful, and the room was big and a high quality. We had a river view which was very nice. 
The bar has a postcard view and lovely and relaxing. 
The staff were always friendly and helpful. 
My only gripe, one lift was broken and the other was painfully slow. 
We had also paid extra for a family Room, which seemed to be no different to the 2 person room a family member was staying in, although we had the sofa made into a bed and they didnt. Why did we need to pay extra, for the sheets? 

We didn't eat at sunborn so cannot comment but I did see the breakfast and it looked nice, if the reduced price early breakfast was available we would have tried it. 
Getting to sunborn was also a real adventure as we got the clipper boat bus and then the cable car, thus was an adventure in its self. 
I'm in no doubt we will be bragging about this place for a while. 
",4,2018,02,15
119,50th special weekend,"A fantastic place to stay. Only downside is it's a little out of the way so plan your journey carefully. We also went to Westfield only a few stops away then superb javelin train straight back to KX. 
Yacht rooms were huge with Molton Brown toiletries and nice coffee and treats. Fab shower and nice lounge area to rest before our theatre visit. 
Only woken up by the fire alarm but a pleasant apology from reception was acceptable.
Tip-shop around for prices we only paid £75 per room and incredible breakfast for £6 round the corner at Cafe B.
Will return if we are in that area again.",5,2018,02,15
119,Romantic setting,Ideal place for a romantic occasion we only spend one night. The reception area was so grand. The staff who Checked us in were friendly and courteous. The room was very lovely and very clean with lots of space. We would definitely return to the Sunborn.,4,2018,02,14
119,Disappointed,"We were so looking forward to my belated birthday break. So disappointed!  The rooms need some tlc, carpets have seen better days. Such a shame, because it really could be so much better. Not impressed with the breakfast at all, most of the food was just warm. The only positives were the staff & good shower. The lift wasn't working on the last day, no signs to tell you wasn't working, we we were just stood waiting for ages, it was actually a guest that told us not working. We reported coffee machine was leaking on the first morning, still not re-paired next morning.",4,2018,02,14
119,Symphony treatments and Afternoon tea,We enjoyed very relaxing massages and facials in the Symphony suite having been greeted by two lovely beauticians and then had a delicious afternoon tea in the restaurant.  All members of staff were courteous and welcoming but our waitress Salomey couldn't have been more kind and helpful.  Nothing was too much trouble and she was attentive without being over bearing.  We've already recommended going there to a friend!,4,2018,02,13
119,"Lovely hotel, reception staff could be nice","It's a bit of a trek to get out to this part of London, but as I found such a good price to stay at the Sunborn we just had to do it. Rooms are lovely, well decorated with plush carpets, big TV, and really comfy beds. Bathrooms clean with fluffy towels and hot water. It was a real novelty to be able to stay in a yacht.

Downside was that their fire alarm went off at 12.30am and woke everyone up, and once up I couldn't get back to sleep for many hours. I was then left shattered and had to cancel some of my plans for the following day. I appreciate these things happen, but think the hotel should either give some money back or provide a free breakfast or something as people go to hotels to sleep, and that's what they prevented me from doing. I spoke to the lady in reception when checking out the next day and she didn't care at all - some form of gesture, even an apology, would have gone a long way. 

It's also worth pointing out that their fire evacuation instructions were high up on a wall in the room, in tiny print and very hard to read. Thankfully it was not the real thing, as there could be some serious casualties amongst guests if that had been an actual fire. Assembly point is easy to guess, how to get there is not.",4,2018,02,13
119,Romantic setting,"The Sunborn Yacht Hotel is an ideal place for a romantic occasion. We only experienced this for a night therefore we didn't have the opportunity to explore the facilities but the yacht was beautiful. It is close to Canning Town Station and there is a convenience store nearby as well as a cash point. You can also take the Emirates Air Line, which is what we used and the yacht is right outside the Excel Centre on the docks. The reception area was so grand in appearance and the staff who checked us in were friendly and courteous. The walk to the room was great as the hallways were clean and bright. The room itself was absolutely phenomenal with lots of space. We had a lovely view of the river, which was even better when the sun went down. As we went on a Monday, it was not busy at all. There is a bar, open until midnight, as well as a Sky Lounge, which we didn't have the chance to visit. Hopefully we will get a chance to do so next time as we would definitely return to the Sunborn.",4,2018,02,13
119,Didn’t get to stay on sunborn,"Arrived at the sunborn and was told they booked us in to the Novotel hotel next door because the heating and hot water on the sunborn wasn’t working which ok that’s one of them things but no apology and really wasn’t explaining what was going on, anyway the Novotel at the Excel said they had a room ready for us at same price as the sunborn £320 I think as the sunborn as arranged it for everyone, well we cancelled the sunborn and rebooked the Novotel as a new booking and got the family room for 2 nights for £158 instead of £320 , I must say that the Novotel was great, excellent service, great staff, very,very clean and modern hotel and rooms , would really recommend the Novotel, also very close to the o2 which was also great",2,2018,02,12
119,Always a treat.,"We have visited the Sunborn before and always enjoyed the uniqueness of the experience of being on such a beautiful boat. 
Our room was 2044 and was very nice. The view is amazing and especially so at night. The location is no good for central London. It's a mission especially when the DLR is not running due to maintenance. Perfect for the o2 but you still need to get the tube and DLR back after 2130 as the cable car is closed. The Sunborn is a novelty and very expensive to eat there also. There are restaurants close by and a very greasy spoon where we ate and are still alive! We parked at the excel and not the o2. The last time we stayed in 2015 the boat was in better shape. It's looking a little tired on closer inspection. I couldn't shower as the bathroom had no heating and was freezing. The room has a blower heater which was warm but very dry. Like sitting in the car. The tea and coffee is a little mean. No water either. The shine has slightly left the Sunborn and it needs some tlc. There was lots of rubbish trapped around the boat so it looked dirty☹️. Come on Sunborn make it a luxury again! ",3,2018,02,12
119,F...A...B,"Beautiful yacht hotel on the Thames.  Room gorgeous with huge oh so comfy bed. Very lovely hotel and a pleasure to stay there.
Close to Emirates cable car for O2 visit and short walk to local transport.",5,2018,02,12
119,Miss,"Been there with my fiancee, really nice place to stay in London, i would defianatly go back, but prices doesnt match quality of the restaurant, we had dinner there, but every single time when we need something i would need to look for a waiter to serve us, because all of them was having a chat behind us.

Room was great, clean, with nice view, we did order cocktails for a room service, but haven't received longer than 40 mins, i tried to call reception and a room service several times but no one answer, so it made me go downstairs and cancel my order.",3,2018,02,11
119,Wonderful 80th birthday celebration,I took my mother to Sunborn for one night stay to celebrate her birthday. All our special requirements were met. The rooms were very spacious and welcoming. Really beautiful and a lovely atmosphere. Food in the restaurant was delicious. The view was amazing. Staff were very welcoming and extremely helpful. Returning there for Mother's Day March 2018.,5,2018,02,11
119,Beautiful hotel,"I stayed here with my partner on the 29th of January. I booked the romantic package for his birthday and we were not disappointed. The hotel and rooms are beautiful, the dinner was delicious and breakfast was excellent. We slept extremely well in the very comfortable beds and my partner asked me to marry him on our night there. Definitely not a trip we will ever forget. We would love to go back again. We had a bit of a walk to get there but it was so beautiful and worth every minute it took to get there. ",5,2018,02,11
119,Unique hotel,"The sunborn is such a good place to stay in London if your wanting a unique experience and something different from your typical hotel. It is within walking distance to the emirates cable car which can also be seen lit up at night from the restaurant/bar on board. The lobby is beautiful, with a large double staircase and amazing chandelier. Service and food in the restaurant could not be faulted and it was a very relaxed, enjoyable atmosphere. ",5,2018,02,10
119,What Fun !,"Excellent value for money . All very clean and not overheated as many London Hotels. Staff very friendly and helpful - room upgrade was a lovely surprise - definitely stay again ! Were not bothered by any noise, would,be an excellent choice if using City Airport.",4,2018,02,09
119,Sunborn on a Sunday,"We were celebrating my dad's birthday and upon arriving we were placed next to a window with stunning views but unfortunately the location was slightly cold so we had to be reseated. The set menu options were limited (only 1 for Sundays) which was disappoint but our waitress; Salomey saved the day!  She was charming and very attentive, with great eye for detail and exceptional knowledge of menu choices which helped us finalise our selections very quickly. Overall I think all the staff were very pleasant but she really stood out as she made sure we were happy and comfortable throughout.",4,2018,02,07
119,Lovely,"Was very nice it’s just some of the finer details you’d expect were not up to standard. One of the Bathroom lights were not working. And they didn’t use real rose petals on the bed. 
But overall the hotel was stunning the food was beautiful and well presented and the staff were lovely. ",4,2018,02,06
119,Amazing!,"Stayed here for my birthday, can't fault it really! Luxurious yacht, service was excellent, our room was huge. Brilliant loaction too, just a short walk from the Emirates cable car, which we used to travel across the river to The O2.",5,2018,02,06
119,Birthday celebration,We stayed here on 02/02 to celebrate my twin sisters 50th birthday .  Had a fabulous time  . All the staff are so friendly and made us feel so welcome  . Cabin  s are very comfortable and are equipped  everything you could possibly need   We all enjoyed our evening meal  and breakfast  also had a very good choice available .    Thank you for the little extra touches that made their birthday special  . ,5,2018,02,05
119,Unique birthday experience ,We had a wonderful night’s stay for my other half’s birthday in November 2017. We had a basic room so the view wasn’t great - dockside - but even that felt luxurious with the wood everywhere. The bed was lovely & comfortable; toiletries & shower excellent. I’ve only given it 4 stars though as I do think it was very expensive for room only. And we didn’t eat in the restaurant either as that was very expensive & the choice on their normal menu for my vegetarian partner was poor.  They do have a vegetarian taster menu but you have to order that in advance & although it looked delicious it was outside our price range. Really conveniently located near the Emirates cable car for easy access across to the O2,4,2018,02,04
119,Faultless,Just back from overnight stay. Service excellent. Rooms everything you need and huge. Very clean. Very quiet in rooms had no noise issues whatsoever. Highly recommend. Limited cuisine in restaurant for quite steep price £40pp. However 2 min walk from hotel is a fabulous Italian with best steaks I've ever had. ,5,2018,02,04
119,Super staff made the experience special,"My friend and I visited Sunborn London for a spa treatment and Champagne afternoon tea to celebrate her birthday.  We could not have been better looked after from the moment we arrived to when we left.  The experienced spa therapists provided us with a relaxing start to the afternoon with a great back massage and facial using Declor products.  This was followed by a generous Champagne afternoon tea with beautiful views over the water.  Our waitress Salomey was friendly and attentive, without being intrusive and even organised a special birthday treat for my friend at the end of the tea.  I would definitely return.",5,2018,02,03
119,Spa treatment and afternoon tea,"Brilliant! Great service and tea was lovely. Salomey was so kind and made it so special. Would really recommend! 

The boat has a lovely atmosphere and our table was right by the window with the best view. ",5,2018,02,02
119,Luxurious place to stay,"The Sunborn did not disappoint, lovely huge, clean room. Friendly staff. Great bar and cocktails. Situated right next to the excel arena and walking distance to the cable cars which were a must do especially at night. Lots of eateries around this area too. ",5,2018,02,02
119,High tea,"Amazing venue, disappointing service and tea. 
Very few people in the restaurant but even fewer staff. They disappeared except for the lovely maitre de. We had to ask for more tea as we were never offered refills. When we had finished one plate from the cake stand, the waitress simply whisked it away and then on the last tier, she literally poured the cakes onto the final plate.
Shame as there was a group of us celebrating a friends birthday ",3,2018,02,01
119,Had an amazing lunch,Great location with fantastic views from the restaurant overlooking O2 and canary wharf. Terrific food great atmosphere and wonderfully friendly staff especially Salomey who was our waitress and was very helpful and great fun.,5,2018,02,01
119,Beautiful experience,"Arrived to see a beautiful ship, the welcome Service was great . The treatments wow amazing the best and afternoon tea was very tasty 😋 
Bedroom was very comfortable too. The view over looking the water is definitely a must ",5,2018,01,31
119,Ahoy captain...,"My original expectations of this hotel were bang on. It is clean (apart from the stain on the carpet in the room) it is fresh and it is very nice. 

Step off of the DLR at Excell walk across the bridge and you are greeted with a stunning view. The Sunbourne is decked* in brass, glass, creams and delight. 

Once you you board the sunbourne via the glass lift to reception you are greeted by a gentile staircase chandelier combination that provides a light* hint at what is to come. 

The ambience is chilled and the staff work very hard. Check in was pretty quick no major issues a brief glimpse at the bar and deck area juat behind it and off  to inspect the room. 

The suite was a river view and the benefits were difficult to conceive prior to sunset. At which point it became very clear as to what the differences were. 

A big comfortable bed, clean shower with very minor issues that will need some attention at some point but for now it is not an issue. 

Good sleep. 

Would I return maybe. I liked the idea of being on a boat at sea and with a little imagination..

119,Beautiful hotel in stunning location,"Such a lovely property in a beautiful location .  A real treat to stay on the water and the added luxuries are a treat. The rooms are large and the whole decor is decadent.
All staff are friendly and helpful and the views from the restaurant and bar must be amongst the best in the city.",5,2018,01,30
119,"Loved our stay, comfortable, spotlessly clean and friendly staff. Would book again :)","Stayed for one night Sat27th , check out 28th.

Website directions were spot on for sat nav, and train and dlr directions were helpful too. I parked by boat as I have a blue badge so this made life easier.

At the entrance of the Yacht  there are two lifts but one wasn't working, which as times made it busy but hey things happen and it was the weekend, I'm sure they have/will be sorting that out soon. Wasn't a major issue for us.

Once you enter the reception your wowed by a huge staircase and chandelier and smiling faces from reception staff. Eva, was lovely and so friendly. Filled in a check in form and was explained that an £40 would be added to the card for a deposit. But if we didn't have any extra's we'd have not pay it and charge would be charge for the room only. We had arrived early so our room wasn't ready, wasn't a problem so we had a drink in the bar. At 3 went to reception and our room was ready, we had been upgraded as we booked direct ( even with a price match from booking.com price)  was given our room key,so off we went to find our room and wanted to freshen up, your luggage is taken to your room for you. We wanted to have a quite freshen up before we headed out into London as soon as we could and our luggage wasn't in the room when we were arrived in it. We waited for a bit, but no bags. We decided not to bother as we really need to get going. Then luggage was in our room when we returned before midnight thankfully. I think luggage to the rooms could be quicker or let people take their own, we'd be happy to take ours as we needed our luggage really. 
 
Anyway, the room we had an Executive Room with dock view, floor 5 room 5027, this room has a balcony. The room is bigger than I expected and the bed was huge and very comfy, plenty of wardrobe space, with dressing gowns, slippers, ironing board and ironing, there is a free safe to use too. Coffee machine, fridge with water, biscuits. And there's a ipad with hotel details and things to see in london including in the excel which is right near the yacht. Gives you the weather too. Slept really well.

I was surprised by size of the bathroom, bigger than expected for a yacht. The shower was fab size and water power was very good. Toilettes to use, shower cap, thread/needle. soft towels and flannels. Hairdryer.

We had breakfast at £19.95 each and had a lovely view of the dock, cable cars and bit of O2 from our table, the atmosphere was very relaxing. There is a choice of foods hot range : sausages, hash browns, baked beans, tomatoes, mushrooms, scrambled or fried eggs. Range of Tiptree Jam sauces. Cold section: hams and cheeses, pastries and bread for toasting and cereals.

* Be Careful of the carpet near the cereals and where you check in for breakfast as the carpet is ceased upwards and I reaction people trip on it.

Checkout was smooth too and as we had drinks in the bar and breakfast we only had a little extra to pay, they gave us 15 discount off food and drinks as we booked directly with them.

The yacht is close to the EXCEL, and the DLR station- note this line stops around midnight. Just a few minutes walk along the dock and you'll come to the Emirates cable car taking you over to the O2, you can also catch a ferry from near the O2 up the river Thames. They had a deal on single cable car trip and single boat trip £10 per adult. Sso we did this and go off at the end which was the London Eye. Saw, lots of land marks and enjoyed our trip.

Using the Tube and DLR to get to and from the Yacht:  The DLR line is very close by up the steps to EXCEL and walk straight and you'll come to the ticket machines, though you can use a contactless debit card and you can hop on and hop off and will on get charged a max capped rate at the end of the day which is around £7/8 I think. Please note the DLR stops around midnight.

Catch the DLR and get off at Canning Town ( 2 stops) and then your on to the Tube trains services as normal.

Coming back to the boat once you get yourself to Canning Town , you need the DLR train that has Becton on the front. The stop you need to get off at is called Custom House ( this is the stop near the Yacht and Excel,) 

Yes, it's a little bit fiddly to get from too I suppose, but you could use the cable cr if running over to O2 then use the tube from too. Or if you don't mind spending out money on a taxi that'd be possibly too.

Back to Yacht : cant comment of eating a dinner on board as we went into town to eat.

Overall:  lovely comfy room, very clean, friendly staff, lovely breakfast.

Thank you Sunborn for our lovely stay. Would book again. And a big thank you to Eva on reception, so friendly and is a credit to the team x",5,2018,01,29
119,Amazing few days away,"Arrived at the hotel after an eventful tube and DLR journey from Euston Station. I'd advise to research this before and know your journey as we didn't (what a mistake).

Got off the DLR at Royal Victoria, 3 minute walk from this station to the boat. 

arrived at the boat and we were checked in straight away despite us being earlier than check in time. we booked a standard room with just a window and River view, as we travelled in December we didn't see the sense in a balcony. Very pleasantly surprised at the room size and layout, very very good for the money we had paid.

we ate in the hotel restaurant on the night of arrival, again very good service and quality of food, restaurant staff couldn't do enough for us. Food was slightly over priced but when In London you expect that.

One thing I would tell other guests to keep an eye on is the 12.5% service charge, I was charged £2 for a waitress to bring a glass of wine to our table  in the bar I found this a bit steep but my own fault for not checking what I was signing on the bill.

the hotel overall is amazing and so different to the norm. we found the location great once we got our head around the tubes and stations. its a great place to stay If the business of London isn't for you as you can have the best of both tourist in the day but quiet and tranquil in the evening whilst dining on the boat.

The cable car is a must to get over to the O2 as it cuts out using the DLR and you get amazing views from the cable cars.

such a good time had here by both of us and we are already planning our return later in the year.",5,2018,01,29
119,Good but not great location. ,"The sunburn yacht hotel looks awesome and is extremely comfortable and even the basic rooms are spacious and well appointed, but there are some little things that stop this from being a more favourable review. For example the location, perfect if you happen to be visiting Excel London but if you are traveling into the west end it’s an annoying distance into town-not more than 6 miles or so but potentially three trains or a fairly expensive cab ride. Next thing-the really annoying lift entrance which is the only way to enter the hotel. Only one was working and despite it being literally visible from the entrance (about a three foot drop) you must wait for the fairly busy lift to get to your room. Last thing the breakfast-£20 for the buffet and it wasn’t great. Not bad- but not great. Others will find this hotel amazing and we really enjoyed our stay, but those little things are frustrating. ",3,2018,01,28
119,Waiter cant balance a tray of drinks,Beware waiters cant mange to hold a tray and deliver drinks. Spilt a bottle of beer over grandson and still was charged a service charge. Beware of the hidden  service charge. Says its discretionary but husband wasn't told. Do not like paying a service charge when drinks are spilt over us,1,2018,01,27
119,Exceptional value!,"I booked our nights stay with Secret Escapes. Our 'deal' included dinner, overnight stay and breakfast. I cannot rate enough the value for money and what a wonderful experience. The service was friendly and professional, the food was delicious and the room was lovely with all of the facilities you would require.",5,2018,01,23
119,Dreamy,"What a beautiful hotel! Nothing less than 5 stars! The staff were incredibly friendly and very welcoming. The yacht itself is absolutely stunning, the design is so beautiful. Our room was very clean and not overpriced. Perfect for a romantic couple’s getaway. Would gladly live in this hotel if it was allowed! Will definitely return soon! ",5,2018,01,23
119,Wow,Can not fault. The place is just beautiful. Slightly out of the way if you’re spending the day in central London bye the dlr is so close! Best get saving for the next visit. Me and my boyfriend loves it!,5,2018,01,23
119,Fabulous 21st Birthday Lunch,"This is a very well deserved review. We wanted something a little bit different for our daughters 21st birthday so we chose the Sunborn Yacht for lunch, we hadn't been here before and didn't know of anyone that had either. It was exceptional, the staff were outstanding particularly Alessandro and Salomey. Nothing was too much trouble for them they made it so special for our daughter and guests. We had lunch in the west India dock room which they decorated beautifully with balloons, banners and table confetti. There were 20 of us with one little girl and the service was excellent along with the food. All the comments and feedback that we had from our guests said it really was stunning food, service and location.  We would highly recommend.",5,2018,01,23
119,Yacht!!!!!! ,"A lovely nights stay in this beautiful yacht, stayed in a executive river view room, great nights sleep, door to balcony, great views, friendly staff, nothing to much trouble, cost £177.00 per night!!! Booked direct, breakfast £20.00 per person extra, buffet breakfast, would recommend this as an adventure, shame no bath, and shower a bit basic no rainfall and low pressure... ",5,2018,01,22
119,A special event venue,"A great experience awaits you on this super yacht, right at excel park. River views , easy access to rail and underground terminals. Not like normal cruiser, large rooms toilets beds etc. Foods excellent , service super, breakfast was fabulous.",5,2018,01,22
119,Style in the Docklands,"Stayed whilst visiting the Excel Boat show - seemed appropriate!
Booked at a great rate but worth a trip even if not. The restaurant is expensive but service is very good. If you like the idea of staying on a yacht, then this will not disappoint!",4,2018,01,22
119,Awesome looking boat and hotel but bit underwhelming service.,"Stayed here for a night after often looking at this hotel on visits to Excel.
Stunning venue BUT we picked a bad night as it was a large expo hence totally packed and very noisy...
So went out for a meal instead.
To be fair room was quiet and spotless.
Pick a night with no expo on and you'll enjoy it.",4,2018,01,21
119,The sunborn is nothing but the best!,"We had such an amazing time on our short stay. The staff are so helpful and will help with almost anything to the best of their ability, so polite and welcoming! Such a Beautiful beautiful beautiful  yacht which is well looked after and extremely clean! The nights sleep was just eye rolling, I can honestly say it was the best night sleep I’ve ever had! Can not wait to come back!! Definitely a place to visit and return! ",5,2018,01,21
119,Birthday treat ,"We came here for my husband's birthday, such a lovely yacht. Our room was nice and quite big only thing was there were alot of stains on the carpet all white big obvious ones. Bar area was lovely we sat looking out at the docklands view even though it was raining! The barman there Macou was a lovely friendly man and really looked after us. Also the lady on reception when we checked in was really helpful.....we asked to sit down for dinner earlier than 6pm because we had a show at the o2 to get to, she soon sorted this and asked the chef.....also big thank you to the chef for saying yes! Made dinner alot more relaxing. 
Our meal was absolutely delicious! Best salmon iv ever had! My husband had pork belly which was also perfect. We then shared a sticky toffee pudding which was so good! 
The only one thing we weren't keen on was the price of the Continental breakfast. It was £19.50 per person! And wasn't worth it at all. It was help yourself and was only ok not masses of choice. We should of asked really regarding the price it was a rip off. ",4,2018,01,21
119,Relaxing break,"I went to the Sunborn hotel as it looked a little different and I was right. The service was great and had a nice atmosphere at this hotel, luxury rooms also. I really enjoyed my stay. I will be staying again soon.",5,2018,01,21
119,"Comfortable, clean hotel","Stayed here one night before boat show, nice spacious room.  Very comfy bed and clean modern bathroom. Included tea/coffee facilities, complimentary water, fluffy towels and toiletries.
5 minute walk from excel venue parking, numerous restaurants nearby.",4,2018,01,20
119,Really nice change to the normal London hotel,"Well worth a stay, the staff were really helpful and friendly, the reception, bar and restaurant are very welcoming.
The room was reasonably priced although the food and drink is a bit expensive personally, but it tasted great and the service was excellent.

We had a balcony room which was very comfortable and spacious just like a high end cruise ship (although our a/c was not working).

So close to the Excel it is perfect for visiting exhibitions, or a short cable car ride over to the O2 (it stops running at 9pm in the winter though), or 25 mins on the tube and you are into central London.
You can even see London City airport from the deck, but you cant hear it in the rooms.
So much better than the boring old square hotel boxes of the new breed of accommodation.",5,2018,01,19
119,Luxury in an unusual London location,The trip to London for New Year’s Eve and the stay on sunburn was a gift from our family for my husbands 70thbirthday. The boat is fabulous and our room with water view very spacious. Everything about the boat is very glamorous and a great treat for a special occasion. Although it is 6 mile from London’s famous sites the DLR link is superb and cheap if you use your debit card for payment. We had to book a blue zone tickets to see the fireworks on New Year’s Eve but it was easy to get there and back so that shouldn't put you off. The emirates cable car is outside the boat entrance and it is a great trip over to the 02 arena and Greenwich. We had a nice meal at a Chinese restaurant opposite the boat and there were several other reasonable restaurants. From a bridge by the boat you can watch planes taking off from London city airport but you are not disturbed by it on the boat. Really quiet for accommodation in London. The area is being developed and makes a great change from staying central. Really surprised by how nice it all was. Only downside  the food at the sunborn restaurant is beautifully cooked but the portions are very small. My husband filled up on bread rolls. Consequently we had a very reasonable breakfast at a little cafe in the area rather than risk being left hungry at a high price on the boat. Right by the boat is a tesco extra. Great for picking up some nice cakes and biscuits to have with our coffee,4,2018,01,19
119,Perfect place to stay for the Docklands,"Stayed at the Sunborn for the boat show. Have to say it was a lot better than I thought it would be.
Rooms good size and well appointed bars service was good a little expensive but hey that’s London for you anyway. Restaurant was good quality only down side was choice of food and price I would stay again however without any doubt",5,2018,01,19
119,Lovely room,"Lovely room - good quality furnishing and clean.  Good if you like to stay in nice surroudings (however short your stay).  Staff nice and very polite. Unfortunately didn't have a chance to use any of the facilities, Be aware that the yacht is situated 3 tube rides from Waterloo but the tube now stops at 'Custom House', a new station directly at the 'Excel' - you can see the yacht from the steps.  ",4,2018,01,18
119,Beautiful.,"Beautiful Location, beautiful boat. Cannot wait to return in February. So romantic and lovely. 
Local shops close by too. Great views. Also child friendly. 
Got two free glasses of champagne as it was my partners birthday! Amazing",5,2018,01,16
119,Friends birthday treat,"I booked a spa treatment and afternoon tea for my friends birthday. From start to finish we had an amazing time.  The massage was amazing and every care was taken by the two lovely ladies my friend said it was one of the best massages she has had.  The restaurant staff were exceptional our every wish was catered to.  Salomi made sure we had everything we wanted, she was very friendly and helpful.  All the staff were excellent from reception on arrival to the bar staff too. We could not fault it and would highly recommend it.",5,2018,01,16
119,Amazing hotel,Amazing hotel. Hotel got recommended by a a family member. We wasn’t disappointed hotel staff were very friendly. We had an amazing time breakfast was nice with a good selection too choose from. Would stay there again ,5,2018,01,15
119,Good little novelty,"This place is different, glamorous and an experience. Rooms are all the same which are nice and spacious and i really enjoyed myself. The bar and food are expensive but id expect that, after all your staying on a super yacht. £20 EACH for a basic breakfast. Ideal for the 02 arena as the cable car is less than a 10 minute walk. Very peaceful at night. ",4,2018,01,15
119,Gin palace,"We stayed at the yacht on a coach trip to London 

Well presented and the rooms were lager than expected

It,s a bit of a walk to the tube and the public area,s are well laid out and the restaurant is what is expected of a hotel of this standard however it is ultra expensive for food and drink

The place caters more for the business person rather than the tourist.

A small beer and a tonic water £9.00.

It was cheaper to eat at the restaurants across the Square.

The rooms are a bit noisy due to the air conditioning.

Breakfast was superb",4,2018,01,14
119,Afternoon Tea at Sunborn,"We went for Afternoon Tea on the Sunborn Yacht as we live nearby and wanted to see the Yacht.

We knew the price beforehand and thought it may be on the expensive side but afterwards I would say it was well worth it. Portions are really good we got extra sandwiches and there was plenty cakes and scones. I certainly was full and had to take some cakes home. Great selection of teas as well to choose from.

The restaurant itself has a lovely feel to and a nice setting on the dock and is different from most places.

To top it off our waitress Salomey was absolutely wonderful. She was one of the nicest waitresses we have ever had and nothing was too much trouble and all done with a great smile.

I would definitely go back for a repeat visit.",5,2018,01,14
119,Superb anniversary,"The stay brightened up a cold and dreary weekend.  We booked Friday night dinner and bed&breakfast on The Sunborn Yacht Hotel.  Easy to get to.  It is beside The Excel centre and Custom House DLR station.  From the minute we entered the yacht it was delightful.  The reception is shinny glass and chrome and is really welcoming.  The reception staff are friendly and helpful.  We had a room with a balcony overlooking the dock.  Wonderful views of the O2, Emirates cable car (a short walk away) and the iconic buildings in Canary Wharf.  City airport is close but we were almost unaware of the planes.  Dinner was served in the restaurant which looks out over the dock.  The food was lovely and the staff were very attentive and friendly.  We slept very well and the king size bed was very comfortable.  Breakfast was both hot and cold buffet and very comprehensive,  staff again were friendly.  We left our suitcase the checkout day so we could do some sightseeing.  Staff just as friendly and helpful.  Certainly recommend a stay here.  Dock lands has a lot to see and do.",5,2018,01,14
119,Unique hotel,Entrance to hotel unique. First impressions of reception is stunning stair case. First impressions of our room amazing - loved the decor in our room and view of London from balcony. Everything very clean. Downside was room too hot and despite a request at reception to sort air conditioning it remained too warm - left door open to cool room. And as the rest of the hotel was so amazing it was a shame the service wasn’t as good as it should be. Had to ask twice for wine menu and water in Landsends restaurant and extra butter at breakfast. ,5,2018,01,13
119,Amazing,"Just got back from the Sunborn and it was amazing Eva greeted us with a lovely smile as she helped us to book in . We enjoyed evening drinks in the beautiful and relaxing bar .Perfectly situated for the Excel Arena ,We also took the Emirates cable car over to the The o2 Arena . Looking for the perfect excuse to Return ",5,2018,01,13
119,If you're visiting the excel check this hotel out !,"From the 2 minute walk to the excel , the friendliness of the staff and just staying somewhere different , this hotel ticks all the boxes, we really enjoyed our stay, good bar service , excellent food in the restaurant , we are already going to book again in February to return for the classic car show.",5,2018,01,13
119,Excellent,Our second visit and will definitely not be our last! Our favourite place to stay when visiting London. The only negative is;If only the bar and restaurant prices were more in line with other nearby bars and restaurants?,5,2018,01,13
119,"Fun, alternative London stay.","My wife and I were in London for the day and evening and were looking for a reasonably priced hotel stay.

Surprisingly, we found that the Executive River View King was cheaper than a Travelodge in the city. Granted, it takes a little more effort to get to but gave us the opportunity to use the Emirates cable car. We had plans in London for the evening so dropped our bag off, had a quick freshen up before heading out.

We didn't use any of the facilities on board but did take advantage of the little balcony for a nightcap.

The room was spacious and comfortable. The bathroom is on the small side which is apparently in keeping with cruise liners etc. It could have been more luxuriously appointed, particularly the shower but was adequate.

We booked via an online agent and paid upfront. When booking in, we overheard some unhappy guests being asked to pay in advance which is apparently hotel policy which is a little unusual.

We enjoyed our night and would consider staying there again.",4,2018,01,13
119,Great Stay,Rooms and ship has a great feel. Location really convenient for Excel and London (DLR very close by). Good choices for breakfast and cater well for Food allergies etc. Nice to be on the water. Will return again next time I stay in London,5,2018,01,12
119,Gorgeous yacht,"Took my husband here for his first trip to the big city and it didn’t disappoint. Beautiful cabin, Molton Brown toiletries, beautiful food, fabulous location. Cannot wait to go back with my friends! Highly recommend taking the cable car and looking down on the yacht as you arrive! ",5,2018,01,12
119,Great stay. ,As a base for visiting the Excel exhibition centre it's s hard to beat being right on the doorstep. You certainly get a feeling of the opulence of the hotel as soon as you ascend to the reception in the lift. I found the reception staff really welcoming and check in straight forward enough. There is a £40 deposit taken against your credit card to cover incidental expenses but any unused credit is refunded on departure and I didn't find this a problem. The room was great and very clean and well appointed as was the bathroom. I recommend this place for visiting the O2 or Excel and is just as good for Central London being half a dozen stops on the DLR and Jubilee lines from town. ,5,2018,01,11
119,"Nothing special, avoid afternoon tea! ","I wanted to test my husband to a beautiful birthday night out and chose suborn. 

I believe this hotel is totally overrated. The rooms are small and there isn’t anything particularly grand about it. Just looks nice from the outside. 

The food on the boat is totally overpriced. I booked afternoon tea for my husband and I. The sandwiches were completely tasteless and the scones where hard and stale. The tea is not even brewed for you, they just give you a tea bag. It’s definitely not worth it. The cakes were not even fresh. Not happy with this at all. Paid £60 for something that wasn’t even nice at all! 

Also ordered room service which took Over an hour to come. I fell asleep! The pizza looked like it was made from frozen and the cheese was so chewy. 

Would not recommend this place to young couples. I specifically told them it was my husband’s bday and they didn’t nothing special. Didn’t even wish him. 

Not happy and still waiting for management to contact me about the afternoon tea refund. 

",3,2018,01,11
119,Amazing place,"Lovely place situated 2mins away from excel centre. Large rooms with king size beds. The only down side was the exuberant cost of the drinks and breakfast. Also charged £3.50 for the bar staff to walk 5 steps to bring your drinks. There are plenty of eating places within a 5 min walk, Chinese, Indian Lebanese and a good old cafe selling a huge full breakfast for under a fiver. Beautiful place to stay though for the Night, very glamorous and right near the DLR. ",4,2018,01,11
119,Sunborn is fab!,"What a wonderful way to spend a weekend for my husbands bithday!
Fabulous food, great accommodation and wonderful cocktails. Loved every minute ❤️❤️ Can’t wait to come back and would definitely recommend to family and friends",5,2018,01,10
119,Consistently excellent,"I've stayed at the Sunborn three times now in the last year and to be honest I struggle to think of anywhere in the area I would rather stay. The location is only okay (a little far out for easy access to Canary Wharf) but it more than makes up for this with the rooms, which are huge especially given the price. The staff have always been amicable, courteous and polite, and it's something a bit ""different"" from the usual chain hotels dotted around Royal Victoria. ",5,2018,01,10
119,Unique experience,"Great hotel on a now converted small cruise ship. Superb friendly and most attentive staff. Excellent meal in the restaurant, a very pleasurable experience. I can strongly recommend this hotel (and its excellent restaurant).",5,2018,01,10
119,Fantastic boat.,"Lovely boat, really grand looking. Only downsides were location was a little far from central and a cold walk over the bridge as the excel train stop under construction (not sunborns fault). Room service lacked the class the boat has. Overall great stay, few minor tweaks and this could be a fantastic couple stay. ",3,2018,01,10
119,GREAT ACCOMODATION,"Absolutely fantastic Hotel. Would highly recommend this accommodation, Staff, Service and location can not be faulted. Picture on website are not misleading what you see is definitely what you get stunning Hotel.",5,2018,01,10
119,Highly Recommended,I loved the stay!! It was my partners birthday and the service to everything was just amazing. I would deffo go back and stay another night or so. I didnt want to leave and wish i booked another night.,5,2018,01,10
119,London break,"Stopped here in December for a night... arrived when it was dark but the yacht looked impressive... the lift to reception wasn’t working so had to use a side entrance to gain access to the yacht which wasn’t a problem.. as lift was working shortly after we arrived.. checking in was easy & friendly.. our room was on the second deck & with a river view as we asked for... room was clean & comfortable with large comfortable bed & lounge area.. tea, coffee, bottled water & biscuits were on offer but my advise is to take milk as there’s a fridge in room as there is a coffee machine in room but didn’t have enough milk... iPad in the room to use for internet &  hotel facilities... nice toiletries if your there for a night..  I’m just sorry we weren’t setting sail as it was a lovely room.. only down side was there were not many people about but it was a Sunday in mid December... but there are a few bars, restaurants & a Tesco a few mins walk away & the cable cars... so next time I go will be a summer visit to make most...",5,2018,01,08
119,Sunborn,"The boat is very pretty however it is quite dated. Although unique it did not have any wow factor and needs a refurbishment. 
Staff were ok but quite cold. 

On the positive side the room was spacious and the bed was very comfortable. 

Wouldn’t stay again. ",3,2018,01,07
119,NOT up to standard for £250 a night! stained carpets,"having arrived for a 1 night stay on the Saturday the outside of the boat look stunning. We was greeted very well on arrival and the manager allowed us to leave our baggage so we could have a look around London. all good so far :)... checked in at 3pm and was given our rooms we have 4 rooms in total at the cost of £1000 for all rooms. After entering the room we found stains on the carpet that looked like blood, makeup and drink stains. Stains on the carpet was all over to be honest and this was very disappointed to see. They had clearly tried to wash the stains out in return creating another stain around it!!. after check the rest of the room we all found a lot of dust around area's you couldn't see. We had a large pump under our room that went off every so often, I can only guess a surge pump of some kind. 

OVERALL: poor cleaning, stained carpets in all four rooms we had! the cost we paid for one night could nearly cover the cost of new carpets. brilliant size rooms though. would never pay £250 a night per room again.",2,2018,01,07
119,Average at best,"We arrived as part of a group staying for a special birthday celebration. It wasn't cheap but we were looking forward to the experience. We did not get the experience we hoped for. Whilst the room was large the carpet was very stained and grubby. We had seen other reports of dirty carpets and have seen the excuse from the owners was ""we are in the process of a refurbishment"" so presumably that means they have stopped cleaning the old carpets altogether till new ones arrive?  The meal was expensive for what was presented. One member of our party thought their main course was their starter it was so small! There was no atmosphere at all. We did have fun in our group irrespective of the price of the night. Shame.",3,2018,01,06
119,Sunborn Yacht Hotel,Only a one-night stay but an exceptional experience.  Great views of London from our room which was very comfortable and well appointed. All staff were friendly and very helpful/welcoming. The restaurant served excellent food. We will definitely return. A great place to stay if you want a treat and spoil yourselves!,5,2018,01,06
119,A New Year's luxurious treat!,"We spent 2 nights at this hotel to be in London for the fireworks and the London New Year's Day parade - my daughter treated us to the first night and we paid for the second. Every comfort, beautiful furnishings, great location and good transport links.
Dining room & bar have lovely views over the Royal Victoria Dock with London landmarks in the distance. Friendly staff. Normally out of our price range, but worth it for a special treat.",4,2018,01,05
119,3 Night stay on Sunborn London,"We stayed on the Sunborn Yacht for 3 nights as we were celebrating wife's 50th Birthday with friends.  We stayed from 27th December 2017 to 30th December 2017.  Getting to the Yacht from Kings Cross was really easy having got the Underground to Canning Town then the DLR to Royal Victoria where it is only a short walk to the Yacht.  Reception is beautiful and the staff were extremely friendly.  I think the 3pm check in is a little late and should perhaps be 1pm.  One of our rooms was ready but we had to wait for the second room to be ready.  The rooms were large with TV, Coffee machine and fridge.  Aircon didn't really work and although it was December, the rooms were very warm.  Our electricity socket was not working but within 15 minutes a new socket was installed by staff.  My only gripe is that the rooms carpets had numerous drink stains which is a shame as it let the room down.  Perhaps they should either be changed or cleaned.   The Yacht was quiet and plush.  We didn't eat on the Yacht so cant comment on the food, however we had a few drinks in the bar.  These were a little expensive but I suppose you can expect that.  Would certainly recommend a visit.",4,2018,01,03
119,Best nights sleep,"Really good location for anyone who is going to the ExCel or to the O2. The rooms were spacious, we stayed in a Thames view room. I recommend anything off their cocktail menu, especially the Mezcal based cocktails - the bartenders know their stuff! My only grumble was our room was located right next to reception so anyone using the door located just outside the bedroom would make a bit of a racket. Breakfast was delicious, it's a shame the weather was a bit too windy to sit outside.",5,2018,01,03
119,Ok,"Stayed here for one night with two children, 11 & 5. Good checkin. Lovely time in the bar, great service. Didn't dine in the restaurant didn't look like our thing, walked 3mins along dock and Dined at Restaurant 21, yummie 👅. Considering it was purpose built thought there was quite a bit of noise from other rooms, lots of trumping around most of the night. Plus the sofa bed wasn't very comfortable, girls tossed and turned most of the night, plus the sofa bed squeaked loudly. Also pillows not the best. Would recommend Sunborn more for couples, than families. I would also recommend they put in two Queen beds for family rooms, the room was plenty big enough. Didn't do breakfast, thought it was a bit steep at 19.50 each adult, even though children eat for free. Still it was an amazing different kind of accommodation to treat our grand daughters to.",4,2018,01,03
119,Fantastic waitress ,"We visited the restaurant on board the sunborn for afternoon tea. Salomey was our waitress on the 1/1/18! Fantastic service, lovely and friendly! We throughly enjoyed or afternoon tea!  She made us all feel welcome. My 10 year old daughter was in Orr of the beautiful yacht! 
   ",5,2018,01,03
119,Would Certainly Go Back !!!,Stayed here for the Christmas break. Highly delighted. Everything stunning especially size of room and all spotless. Breakfast highly recommended want for nothing. The tube is only a 5 min walk away which takes you straight to London Tower Bridge. I think the only down side is the service charges which is not shown anywhere and you dont know till you get your bill. Other than this I would very much would like to go back in the Summer.,5,2018,01,03
119,Perfect. ,"Stayed here for my birthday and it was perfect. The service was great from the staff on reception, the hotel room was amazing, very clean and spacious. Was in a perfect location for us as it was across the river from the O2 arena. We used the cable car from one side of the river near the sunborne to the O2. 
Perfect!!!

",5,2018,01,03
119,"Beautiful boat, great location, shame about noise ","Our stay at the Sunborn recently had both positive and negative points. The boat itself is beautiful and the room we had was a perfect size, only down side was the bathroom which was very small but wasn’t a massive issue as we were only there 2 nights. The boats location is perfect if visiting the Excel or O2 arena and there’s lots of amenities close by. 
I’ve only given a 3 star for a couple of reasons, mainly the noise levels in the room meant we didn’t get a decent night sleep, we were on the 3rd floor and there were what sounded like children running up and down the corridor and doors slamming until very late and then started again very early, a bit of investment in some sound proofing would probably be worthwhile. Secondly the staff although perfectly polite were not particularly friendly and a lot of the time especially in the restaurant/bar seemed to have the attitude that they were doing you a favour when serving...Receptionist on the other hand were very helpful and friendly. 
",3,2018,01,03
119,NICE ACCOMMODATION,"As a couple we stayed for 1 night in December 2017. 
We stayed in an executive room, and was very happy with the room size and cleanliness.
The bar is very pleasant, but cocktails are a little toppy!
We would certainly recommend Sunborn Hotel.",5,2018,01,02
119,"Well presented, let down by the air conditioning (or lack of!)","Booked a standard room for one night to use as a slightly different base from the norm, for dinner and drinks in London.
Arrived early, easy parking due to close vicinity to Excel, paid £15 flat rate for 24hrs, 2-3 min walk away. Room was",3,2018,01,02
119,Birthday present,"Accommodation beautiful, but having to park at the nearby car park is a huge minus.  It was pouring with rain so not pleasant having to walk even if only for a few minutes.

Food was lovely if expensive.  Cheese platter at £14 for a piece of Red Leicester, Brie and Stilton not acceptable or imaginative given the wide variety of local cheeses available.",4,2018,01,01
119,Spacious and impressive ,"We arrived to an impressive and cosy room here! Considering the temperature outside was only 2 degrees I was happy to find how warm it was on this boat. The rooms are large enough to sleep 4 so don’t be worried about arriving to a small room
Because they are far from it. The room have a massive bed, sofa and coffee table, bathrooms with under floor heating and some Amenities...fridge coffee maker and glasses, enough for a lovely evening if you are staying in your room or going out. 

We arrived at 4pm and checked in at the impressive and very clean reception. We had a look around and decided to book dinner in the restaurant which is surprisingly small but it was already fully booked? Tbh looking at the menu there wasn’t a massive choice but enough to be able to chose something. We decided then to eat at the bar and to our surprise this was packed so we figured we wasn’t the only people who couldn’t get into the restaurant. The prices are average though would avoid spending the night in here. We headed up to the top bar that the boat boasts and sadly this was shut? Not sure why on this occasion. After this we headed out. 

This hotel is perfectly placed if you are visiting the excel centre as this is literally a stone throw away. If you are wanting to visit the o2 dome also you can simply catch a ride on the emirates cable car which is a five minute walk away.

We would definitely come back to this hotel for a stay even if it was just for the gimmick.  ",5,2017,12,29
119,Christmas aboard the Sunborn,"Amazing experience with fantastic staff who were very helpful polite and courteous.
Spotlessly clean and huge comfortable bed.All rooms beautifully furnished with mod cons of espresso coffee machine,flat screen tv and i pad with free WiFi. Great bar with good service although a little pricey,did not visit restaurant as we ate out at nearby Canary Wharf.
Nice quiet area so would definitely recommend to those wanting a peaceful break.
A ride on the Emirates cable cars is a must to see the fantastic views of London especially after dark.
Thank you Sunborn will return in the very near future.",5,2017,12,29
119,Amazing place....,My girlfriend booked this as a surprise 50th birthday present. We stayed for 2 nights and the room was amazing with the best shower EVER ! I can't rate the bar or restaurant as we didn't use either of them. Highly recommended.,5,2017,12,28
119,Lovely room but the rest a let down,We stayed at the Yacht Hotel for Xmas but quite frankly we would have prefer to stay home ! The Yacht itself is amazing and is in a good location if you are visiting the Excel Centre or 02. We stayed in an Executive Waterfacing room with balcony which was very large comfortable and surprisingly quiet. There were plenty of extras in the room and bathroom. The bed was large and comfortable and we both had a good nights sleep. However the Xmas dinner was a real let down. Firstly there was no atmosphere in the restaurant and staff were very slow to serve. I know it was Xmas day and appreciate they were working but there was no excuse for sitting ages waiting to be served. When our Xmas dinner finally arrived it was very meagre portions and everything was from frozen not one piece of freshly prepared food ! At breakfast the next morning there was plenty on offer but again not exciting or even very hot. If I was in the area I would stay there again but would choose to eat elsewhere,4,2017,12,27
119,Xmas Stay,"Loved this place!

Would stay again.

Staff were very nice and helpful, the place is clean and the views are great. Such a nice quiet locaation with a good feel to the place. Cannot wait to visit again. ",5,2017,12,27
119,Brilliant “float hotel”,"We stayed for one night when we saw the Foo Fighters at the O2.
We had cabin 1032 with a river view. It was spacious and comfortable and an exciting place to stay. The bar at the front of the boat is a really nice place to relax. We were lucky enough to have warm weather so sat outside with a bottle of wine before heading across the river.

Plenty of bars and restaurants within walking distance. The hotel is moored right next to the Excel Centre. 

We got across to the O2 via the Emirates cable car and back via tube and the dock lands light railway. ",5,2017,12,26
119,Loved it!!!,"Our stay was short but amazing! Love the concept of staying in a Yacht. 
Very friendly and helpful staff members, upgraded our room too. The riverview was so lovely and peaceful. 
The room was very spacious and clean. My 1 year old son enjoyed exploring around the room by himself. 
Very spacious king size bed, we had an amazing sleep too. 
We will definitely be staying here again, and for longer next time.",5,2017,12,23
119,Champagne afternoon tea (under the sea),"We wanted something different 

Great location; easy to get to thanks to the DLR.
Great reception- good decor 
Champagne afternoon (under the sea) tea was great as the sandwiches tasted delicious.
We were offered various types of sandwiches and tea and they were different to other places.
There were lobster/crab meat and prawn sandwiches and we were offered seconds if we wanted to have more.
The cakes were a bit too sweet but they looked great for the under the sea theme.

Although customer service was friendly but it was extremely slow.

The lady who served us tried hard but she was terrible at her job. We were given tea pots but no cups and saucers and we had to wait for ages to get our cups. 
Again we had to wait for ages after we asked for our bills. It felt a bit like faulty town kind of experience.

It could of been 5/5 rating but having us wait for a long long time before getting us the cups was a bit of a let down.

Location:5/5
Value for money: 3/5
Food: 4/5
Customer service: 3/5",4,2017,12,22
119,Superb quirky venue,"I booked this superb quirky venue as a 'special treat' for my partner and I as a stopover,  to finish our lovely pre Christmas treat after attending the Pete Tong concert at the O2 on Friday 15th December 2017.  Fun and easy access to the O2 via cable car and alternative transport option via the DLR.    ",5,2017,12,20
119,Best champagne afternoon tea ever!,"The food and the service were amazing. We were served by Salomey, who was friendly and could not have been more helpful. She made our visit extra special.
We definitely want to return.

We also treated ourselves to full body massages on board. Wow! We felt fantastic afterwards! What a fantastic treat.

Thank you Sunborn London!

119,Great stay,"great stay really enjoyed very close to central transport , staffs were great location was great , rooms were very big and clean and the views outside the hotel were amazing , emirates cable line close  ",4,2017,12,18
119,Absouloutly Fabulous,"What a lovely place to stay!
We had a wonderful time, if you are going to book, ensure you book a riverside view as you will really miss out on a fantastic view from your cabin or suite.
The staff were amazing and the food was fantastic in the Lands end restaurant.
I will be back to stay in the new year and am looking forward to seeing the Sunborn staff.
Thank you for a fantastic experience.
My partner loved it and so did I.  Thanks Kelly ",5,2017,12,17
119,Doing it in style ,Had an anniversary dinner and stay at the Sunborn. It was a very classy yacht. The room was very spacious with a balcony and the bar was set out very well for couples and groups to enjoy s private time on comfortable sofas. The restaurant had a beautiful view of the docks and the menu was high quality. I enjoyed it immensely. If you have the chance you must go. ,5,2017,12,16
119,Cannot be faulted,"Stayed overnight to visit the O2 (accessible by nearby cablecar- does not operate after 9,00 pm so took a taxi on return).Reserved junior suite with river room including breakfast. The standard of service, room size and facilities were first class as was the buffet breakfast.
We travelled from London Bridge on Jubilee Line to North Greenwich (next to O2) then across the Thames by Cable Car, the hotel is a short walk along the embankment). Was later advised it was possible to take River Boat from London Bridge to O2 the Cable Car to hotel might try that next time.",5,2017,12,15
119,Very good stay,"We were upgraded to an executive room which we were very impressed with.  The room and bed were very comfortable. I thought all staff were very friendly. 
Great location for the O2, just yards from the cable car. Overall the room was good value but I was put off by the price of breakfast, £20 per person is excessive.",4,2017,12,14
119,Disapointing,"We have cruised with Seabourne so this was a reminiscing trip to the same type of ship and the cabins and ship had the same layout as we remembered. The reception staff were very welcoming but the whole hotel was quite cold. on returning from the Oxford st Christmas lights and multiple tube changes note the hotel is a long way out though would be very handy for those visiting the Excel centre or the 02.We booked the restaurant and spent time relaxing in our room and choosing what we would have from the tablet they provide. The restaurant had only 2 tables full in it and a singer was singing Adele songs, she was excellent but the group who were on the table she was clearly performing to were loud, rude and drunk, making our quiet romantic meal a no go. We were then told that we could only choose from the a la carte menue as there was a do on .This menu was grossly overpriced and  the food was poor quality. The restaurant was chilly however the waitress and singer were amazing.All in all we had an ok stay and was nice to reminisce but would not recommend to friends as has little atmosphere and food overpriced and poor. Our original cruising experience was 5 star and this was far from it.",3,2017,12,13
119,amazing,"We upgraded to a executive room it was very nice indeed with a balcony,sofa and Queen size bed it was very clean and comfortable.
The hotel was immaculate everywhere we were very impressed.
The food at dinner was probably the best food I've ever had it was expensive but was worth every penny.
The drinks in the bar were expensive but what a view.
Overal both myself and my partner were extremely happy with our stay and we will be coming back in the summer.
Thank you to all the staff for a lovely stay.",5,2017,12,13
119,Magical,As you round the corner and see the boat you know you are in for an experience. Staff very helpful and always smiling. Food excellent. Room large comfy and very very clean. Couldn't fault anything except the weather.,5,2017,12,13
119,Disappointing ,"This is a hotel that makes it's money by fleecing it's customers rather than providing good service. Won't stay again - got no sleep due to noise, were given the wrong room and waited for ages to be relocated and I've truly never experienced such poor customer service. 'Luxury' it most certainly is not, more on the 'tacky' end of the spectrum. Distinctly underwhelming for what we paid.",2,2017,12,12
119,Lovely hotel with great views of the city.,"We really enjoyed our stay at the Sunborn London yacht hotel. Our room was clean and well furnished. The food quality is excellent, and the staff are all friendly and very helpful. We especially enjoyed trying the new Christmas cocktails with amazing city views as a backdrop. ",5,2017,12,10
119,Fantastic Anniversary Night ,"Booked as a surprise for my husband on our Anniversary.  Great choice.  Such a lovely alternative to a regular hotel.  Good size rooms and suites.... upgraded due to a hot tub pump issue in adjoining room.  Good service... especially from Laszlo, the Restaurant Supervisor who provided our perfect Room Service dinner.  Snow sadly prevented full enjoyment of huge balcony.  Summer visits likely to provide more enjoyment of this beautiful yacht and surrounding area and spectacular views.  Recommend. ",5,2017,12,10
119,Ok for a one off.,"Stayed here on a Saturday night.
Check in was at 3 pm but we arrived a bit earlier to have a look around.
It appears you had to give your card details for them to take £40 in case you used the bar or room service.
Had a drink in the bar,couldn't have one of the local beers as none available and I believe they had no lemonade either.
Service charge for bringing the drinks to the table was a bit of a shocker as I tried to order at the bar but told to take a seat.
We booked directly with the hotel where it states you would get a room upgrade if available but of course none was available.Our room was clean,no information pack,no details of room service.Carpet was stained with black marks which I didn't expect.
Shower and bathroom was clean with complimentary sundries.
We had the breakfast,£19.95 a head for a buffet style.Cook your own toast as well.
Was a bit disappointed when the staff started to clear the table whilst I was still eating.At nearly £20.00 a head for breakfast I thought it was very poor.
When you book directly with hotel you are supposed to get a discount when eating and drinking but at checkout we had to explain this to the reception staff.Didn't get any discount for the breakfast.
All in all not bad but there are better hotels and cheaper in the area.

",3,2017,12,10
119,Ok stay,"We were asked at checkin if we were here to celebrate any occassion and we said it was our anniversary and seemed like the hotel was going to add the personal touch but that was not the case, it was just a question.overall our stay was good apart from the sink plug being broken  shut and not fixed, upon arrival which was annoying. The rooms are spacious and i feel there is a lack of ventilation as there are no windows in the standard rooms with no balconys and it can smell of seweage at times which is why i asked to on the second floor and that helped.",3,2017,12,10
119,Great overnight stay,"We had a great night stay at the sunborn it was our second time staying there staff very friendly and the hotel was immaculate throughout looked great at nightsdid it during the day 
Room was spacious with tea and coffee facilities ",4,2017,12,09
119,Absolutely stunning ,"Me and my partner have just had our first break away without the children in nearly 10 years, and what a place to take it, stunning is an understatement, our room was huge with the comfiest bed, complimentary biscuits, hot chocolate, tea and coffee with mini fridge and water, food was lovely and reasonably priced as was the drinks, all the staff were very friendly and helpful, we have stayed in London on many occasion and this place was by far the best place we've ever stayed, cleanliness was second to none, we're already planning our next visit as one night wasn't enough, the location is fantastic and only a few minutes walk from the nearest station taking you into central London which again is only minutes away on the underground, can't wait for our next visit with children as they'll also love the hotel/yacht ",5,2017,12,09
119,Disappointed ,"My Husband and I have just stayed for two nights. On arrival we went to our room, which stank of sewage, we requested a room change which was made with minimal fuss. 
New room was great, no smell, lovely and clean as the other room had also been. 
The carpet had at least 7 stains dotted around... not great for £195 a night, breakfast not included. 
But it was lovely and clean, good shower, lovely Molton Brown products. 
2am on the second night the picture fell off the wall and landed on the bed. Not a fabulous way to be woken up.
We told the receptionist when we checked out, as it could of been very dangerous and we could of been seriously injured . We filled out an accident form..... and that was it!!!!! 
A little disappointing, no manager came to apologise , no personal touch. We were very gracious about it, would you be if a picture landed on you in the middle of the night. I think most wouldn’t be.
We have looked forward to our stay here, but have been disappointed. It is definitely lacking any personal touch, even the Christmas decorations were a little sad. 
Definitely not worth the money. ",2,2017,12,07
119,Remarkable experience ,"I booked on groupon an amazing experience of massage and tea for 2 on this luxurious yacht!!!
We truly enjoyed ourselves whilst celebrating our wedding anniversary ❤️
The massage was very relaxing and pleasant and the tea was delicious!!!
I even had the opportunity to try their organic hot chocolate ❤️ delicious ❤️
I deeply recommend this experience to all couples ❤️",5,2017,12,06
119,Unfortuantely very satisfactory,"The first time we came we was amazed at how lovely the room was. However on this occasion, the carpet in our room was full of stains and the mattress to the bed was like sleeping on a rock! Disappointed!",3,2017,12,05
119,Family Birthday,"Overall experience was lovely, I did expect more, especially considering how much I paid, but in general it was an experience for all.
Food and service was good, shame about the weather, felt that the room could have had another bed in to accommodate the children, this was not offered or mentioned.",4,2017,12,05
119,It was ‘OK’,Very dated. Bed was comfy and river view was lovely! Breakfast wasn’t great at all.. afternoon Tea was poor and was not worth the money. Lovely looking on the outside however the place needs an update ... I would not recommend for elderly or disabled people. I won’t be staying again,3,2017,12,05
119,Sunborn london,"Fantastic hotel, amazing service from staff. Recomended! The only negative is that the complimentary upgrade was not applied when booked direct with hotel, so an idea to check with hotel before arrival. ",5,2017,12,05
119,"Reception Jim , but not as we know it","This is the second time we have stayed hear and have really enjoyed both occasions. By London standards the rooms are quite spacious and I think just its look of being a ""super yacht"" with great views of the capital make it special. We will return
I would though ask that the booking in procedure is looked into as on both occasions the scenario was the same.
On arrival you go to the  check in desk and give your name and booking reference. So far so good. Then you are asked to fill out a form with your address and contact details. You don't need this. Then you are asked how long you are staying, you already know this. Then you are asked how many there are of you. You already know this. Then comes the ""stare"" ,this involves a very earnest receptionist intensely focusing their attention on their screen, with furrowed brows. You stand there imagining that they are trying to calculate possibly the coordinates for a jump to hyper space or maybe launching a photon torpedo. At some point they will leave their station and go off to ask advice from someone else. They to look very earnest and maybe a little concerned, are we Klingons? In my minds eye I am starting to imagine them with Spock ears due to the extraordinarily complex calculations they are having to compute.
Time passes, the universe turns, 15 minutes of my life are lost before, yes we are given the access cards to our room.
Really, this should be all over in about 45 seconds",4,2017,12,05
119,Fabulous,"My girlfriend and I stopped there last Saturday as an Xmas treat as I am working all weekends leading up to Christmas. 
We loved the hotel and found everything excellent. 
The lady on check in was lovely and very helpful with best ways to get into the centre. The room was fabulous, and the bottle of fizz we had ordered was waiting for us already in ice. 
Not that I drink coffee, but those that do will enjoy the coffee machine in the room. 

After a heavy night in London, we slept very well in the huge and comfy bed. 

In the morning breakfast was really good, with staff being friendly again as they had been in the bar the previous evening. 

Checkout was quick and easy which rounded off a lovely stay

What was an added bonus was that I had left a magic coin set in the room( I’m a magician). I rang the hotel and they later emailed me to say it had been found, and they will post it to me. The set looks like normal money so would have been easy to keep, but the honesty of the staff is second to none. 

I really recommend this hotel and will definitely be returning. For those worried it’s a little far out, it’s only a few minutes from Canning Town tube and then about 20 minutes on the Jubilee line to central areas. 

Thank you for a lovely stay !! ",5,2017,12,04
119,Bert,"Everything is better. The room space is large. The reception is better for servicing person. the bathroom also is very good. The room likes room suits in the apartment. I would review again if i need to something around hotel.
",5,2017,12,03
119,Not as good as I hoped,"Have wanted to stay on here or book an event for years... booked concert at 02 as an excuse.... do not recommend unless you lock in a great rate. I knew it was pretty much in the middle of nowhere (surrounding area) so only useful for Excel or 02 (opposite side of estuary and river)...first impression was cheap, sparse furniture, not cosy or luxurious. Christmas tree was super budget, think family in a budget trying their best. Not one English staff member... the big put off for for me was the Team Leader... lady with long hair... I had asked for complimentary upgrade as booked direct - this now warranted investigation- right in front of me - then she came out again to remind staff only upgrade one level - no class. Tacky through and through. Feeling as if they’re trained (so management and owners culture) to extract every penny they can from you.... staff were polite but you felt either nervous or very new - feeling management run this place with an iron fist. Would not recommend or ever stay again. Put me off staying in Sunborne, Gibraltar in summer for a week... will stay in Rock instead.... bed very comfortable",2,2017,12,03
119,Amazing floating hotel,"Stayed there last night for a night out at the O2. Super convenient for the O2 via the Emirates Airline. Fantastic cruise ship/luxury yacht appeal, very comfy beds, spacious rooms, friendly and informed staff and a good breakfast. Definitely stay again.",5,2017,12,01
119,Excellent for concert accommodation,"Please improve the room service for patrons who have attended shows. Local restaurants close before you return to the area and it makes it very hard to get something to eat.
Everything else is excellent.",4,2017,11,30
119,Excellent stay-higly recommend,Had a wonderful 2 night stay on the sunborn. We upgraded to the 5th floor with a balcony which included breakfast (which was superb) The suite was very clean and spacious with lovely views across the dockland. The customer service we received from the staff was excellent. We did not have dinner in the restaurant but can certainly recommend the breakfast. We will def stay again when visiting the 02,5,2017,11,30
119,Surprise birthday treat,"My boyfriend booked me night as surprise for my birthday. The view from outside was amazing, the inside is amazing as well. Upon check in they do require £40 upfront for pre auth which basically covers the breakfast for two (very dear even for London) we got room and the bf has Arrange for champagne in room on arrival which lovely touch. The room was really nice,and some nice touches like coffee machine and that. Only negatives I would have is the bathroom toilet wouldn’t flush and all night could hear it filling up, the food menu was very limited had better choice in room service & that was limited. At check out their really long que if you had extra no point queuing check out as they just take it from card without having card in person. The pillows are terrible and gave me bad neck ache next day. ",4,2017,11,29
119,Nice yacth,"Nice rooms, we had a huge room with a small porch with a view over The water. Clean and beautiful. The staff at the reception was super Nice and helpfull. The breakfast was a little dissapointing, since everything Else was so great! The breakfast was a little simple. But all in all, a great night!!",4,2017,11,29
119,Lovely Hotel,"Gorgeous room with balcony some nice little extras in the room.   Pleasant staff with easy check in, no hassle, great amenities.  would stay again and recommend.  Fabulous reception didn't get a chance to use the bar or restaurant maybe next time.",5,2017,11,29
119,Nice place,"Nice hotel, welcoming reception. When we checked in, were told the price of breakfast but not what time its available from. Had to ask that before we headed off to our room.
Room was nice with balcony. Not much of a view, would've been good if we had the view of Dockland. Can't be too picky as we did get upgrade.
The shower room can do with being upgraded and same with carpet in the room, there was a couple of marks on the carpet, not sure if it can be steam cleaned out.
Got a good price on this.
Stay was pleasant.",4,2017,11,28
119,Amazing place,I booked this place after being let down by #trivargo. #hotelquickly. #4*tophams hotel.    So pleased I found this place     a little out of the centre of London   but we'll worth it     you get to see more of London and pure luxury.,5,2017,11,27
119,Mr Wilson,"Great place, great service, great food, could not fault anything, if I was being really picky the carpet in our room had some drink (coffee) stains in it otherwise Excellent, Great views of the London skyline at night from the restaurant.",5,2017,11,26
119,As perfect as it sounds,"Came for business for  3 nights for the food show at Excel, which is next door to the hotel. big spacious clean rooms with bathrobes and all the posh fun stuff in the room. great service from the front desk staff, comfy beds, amazing breakfast and of course - its a yacht so that's cool!
I had fun even though i was there only for a short while.",5,2017,11,25
119,Great location for the O2,We booked this after seeing the hotel on a previous trip to London and we weren’t disappointed. The yacht is very glamorous and the staff were all friendly and efficient. The room was fab - very big with an amazingly comfortable bed. Great coffee machine and biscuits 😀 Molten Brown products and lovely large fluffy towels. We had a drink in the bar after we came back from the O2 - as you’d expect it was a little pricy but excellent service. We didn’t eat at the hotel so can’t comment on that.,4,2017,11,25
119,Bday treat ,"Stayed overnight with my family as a bday treat to my husband. Exterior was superb however the family room was way to small to be called family room, it was good for double tbh. Staff were helpful thou. Good for couples but with kids better stay somewhere else i guess. ",3,2017,11,25
119,Shocking from start to finish,"Where do I start..... this was a birthday present. Booked for 3 nights, checked out after one!  ( after a battle with the management) then charged us £241 to stay in a room that was dirty and carpet stained. Youth hostel at best! Was running 10 mins late for afternoon tea booking due to DLR closure so was advised "" don't worry check in after you've eaten  "" so we had a very pleasant afternoon tea with champagne £90 and then proceeded to check in... we had no ID as we live locally and was then asked to pay £40 per room per night just in case the room was damaged ( look at the state of the carpets....they should be paying us to stay!?) anyway we paid and were given a 15% discount off all food and drink....we said, oh great we've just paid £90 for afternoon tea, could you credit the 15% back please????? Oh no sir, it's too late!!!!! Incredible poor customer service and quite unbelievable. After an hour discussion they reluctantly refunded the 15%. Not a good start. We then checked in, saw the state of the room and complained...we were in a hurry as we had theatre bookings so agreed to discuss in morning. We had drinks in the bar that night and started off with a warm prosecco!! And each time I advised them about the 15% offer....they conveniently forget to apply and said they couldn't change the bill....I also waited 10 mins at the bar for my bill and the bar was virtually empty. 

Our meeting with customer relations was painful and unsatisfactory. We just wanted to check out after such a disappointing and upsetting experience and receive a refund for the nights we were not staying (it was paid upfront by my partner) - not easy apparently if you've already paid them!!! After another 30 minutes of discussion they eventually refunded £140 ( for the night we did not stay) and presented us with a bill for £240.......no discount, no apology. 

Very poor standards, shocking customer service and totally overrated. 

We have friends and family members have already cancelled future bookings following my experience. 

Oh, when I checked the price of the afternoon tea online it was 10% cheaper than we were charged. A rip off. 

You do not get what it says on the website - Completely misleading 

AVOID AT ALL COSTS",1,2017,11,25
119,40th birthday celebration,"Had the most amazing stay at the sunborn. Had a three course meal and was so spoiled with the outstanding service we were given by Salomey who catered for our every need with a big smile and wonderful energy. The hotel was so sparkling clean and the breakfast was amazing. Had the best night sleep in the comfy bed and every member of staff we come across was so nice, made this trip unforgettable, we will definitely be coming to stay again thank u so much x",5,2017,11,24
119,Short stay,"Stayed for one night for my boyfriend's birthday. Probably didn't get time to appreciate the hotel as we were hardly there. 

We stayed in an executive room with a balcony and river view - the room was very spacious with a lovely view from the balcony of the O2 and Canary Wharf. The bed was also huge and comfy. Plenty of mirrors around the room which is always a good thing for us girls. Both British and international plug sockets too. The bathroom door is very heavy and does not stay open so is very hot in there after a shower. Lovely Molton Brown toiletries provided.

Breakfast was a little steep at £39 for two people I thought but luckily was very nice; pastries, cereals, fruit, cold meats and cheeses and a plentiful cooked breakfast option. 

The hotel is a short walk from Royal Victoria DLR station and the Emirates Airline cable cars across to the O2. West Silvertown DLR is also a 10 minute walk away across a bridge. It took us 45ish minutes to get to Covent Garden once we had checked out.

The hotel charge you at the time of booking for your room booking. They then charge you for breakfast on arrival. They also charge you £40 for any extras but then refund you at check-out if these haven't been used. Cannot comment on the bar and restaurant. as we ate and drank out in Canary Wharf. I agree that parts of the hotel look a little dated but this did not matter to us.

Quite an expensive stay and I wish we got to appreciate the hotel a little more but we enjoyed our time there and was the perfect location for our itinerary of walking over the O2 and eating in Canary Wharf.",4,2017,11,23
119,A Shipshape hotel,"We used the Sunborn as overnight accomodation as part of a London break with GB Tours.
A large comfortable room with all the usual facilities.
Only complaint would be the noisy air-con, I know ship air-con is noisy but this one whistled back at me when I turned the unit off.
Overall, a good experience.",4,2017,11,23
119,Not smooth sailing - unfortunate.,"We stayed at the Sunborn hotel to attend the conference at the Excel Center for two nights in the classic room on the first floor.  I thought the room was nice for a ship room - I really liked the wood features and the wood floor and the roomy layout (for a ship).  The bathroom was nicely appointed and very clean.  The bed was comfortable, seperate reading lights, and a clock/tablet bedside that you could use web search was very handy.

At first glance - we thought it was going to be a fun, different experience than your average conference hotel.  However, we were in for a long uncomfortable night.  The temperature of the room was set for 24 Celsius and couldn't cool down.  The room, being a ship room was pretty airtight so we felt like we were in an oven - it was so dry and hot all night long.  To add to that our mini-refrigerator kept making a ""whirring"" noise every five minutes!   I contacted the front desk, they said they couldn't do anything else except send an engineer the next day and to turn the thermostat off.  It stayed hot all night - we did not get much sleep for a full days work at the conference. 

The next day I had to reiterate my request twice more for the temperature and the mini-frig to be fixed.  Even though I was instructed to simply turn the thermostat ""off"", I turned the air con on at noon - and was happy I did.  The mini-frig was repaired and re-installed.  I was grateful for the resolution.

Bathroom - the bathroom has a heavy ship door without ventilation, so when you take a shower, it steams up the bathroom and you can't use the mirror to get ready.  We used the trash can to jam the door open so the steam would clear and we could get ready for the conference.  

Espresso maker - I loved the espresso maker in the room but the plug outlet was European and the espresso maker was UK.  I had to bring the espresso maker over to the bench area where I could plug it into a UK outlet.  Strange.

Checking out I heard another couple speaking to the front desk about their room being too hot, and I spoke to another couple in the elevator who sadly, also had a hot room.  How strange that simple temperature management could be so bad.  I also felt that the front desk pretty much was unsympathetic to everyone's complaint and perhaps that's why it was such a common issue - lack of caring.

Overall, the Sunborn Yacht hotel was definitely a different experience, but in ways I didn't expect.",3,2017,11,22
119,very good,"a nice hotel. the food was excellent. Room pleasant and clean. we had a balcony with the see view, amazing sunrise. I wish they had a better bar facilities and car park. Staff was a bit disorganized in my opinion.",4,2017,11,20
119,"Good location, large clean room let down by silly little things.","Check in was an issue but that was down to my office. Why the receptionist couldn’t check with the restaurant if the prepaid high tea was sorted was beyond me. 
Eva was very helpful. 
High tea, at £47.00 wasn’t value for money. 
We were heading to the O2 to watch the tennis and when we arrived back the silly things - wasn’t sure if we could order supper, 23:25 and it shut at 23:30; we did get food. 
Last orders were at 23:30 but the bar closed at 00:00 
Would I stay again; sadly no.",3,2017,11,19
119,Birthday treat,"Oh dear i have to say it was not as expected ,the room however was huge ,cupboards were tacky.Seriously over priced and way to expensive for what it is .I would say the staff are very good i came away thinking it was ""nice"" but not the wow factor i was hoping for.However if you dont mind spending over the odds then maybe its for you .",3,2017,11,18
119,"Amazing, luxury and comfort at its finest",Fantastic place a unique experience for my girls birthday break.  Comfort and luxury. Can't wait to go back!!  Quality hotel at an affordable price.  Great for traveling to the City.  Loads to do had a great weekend,5,2017,11,17
119,Very good hotel,Really spacious comfortable suites with spectacular views across the city.  Some of the more central areas such as reception look a little dated in their style but are all clean and presentable.The food was excellent.,4,2017,11,14
119,Very convenient for Excel,"Our room was spacious and comfortable.  Service in bar and restaurant however was mixed with some staff courteous and customer oriented and others, quite the opposite. I did complain to management regarding the poor service from some staff and I felt that they responded well to my concerns, which is positive.  We will likely return.",4,2017,11,13
119,Theatre weekend with GB Tours,"Wow, what a fantastic place to stay. A yacht on the Thames, who would have thought.
A stunning reception entrance, with a very elegant staircase that I just had to pose on. Friendly helpful staff, lovely clean environment, beautiful room and very comfy bed, no steaming in bathroom when we showered, and no extraction fan noise, brilliant, and a great breakfast.  A very big thank you to one and all.  Look forward to returning again one day.",5,2017,11,13
119,Great birthday weekend!,Sunborn was a great venue for my daughters 21st. The two rooms / cabins were great and the venue perfect. Good local restaurants and Excel and we got the cable car to Greenwich and then river boat into Central London for our night out. ,4,2017,11,12
119,"Overpriced, quiet area, poor room service, wouldn't return.","Pictures of this hotel look amazing however the interior of the rooms are very standard. We had an executive room with river view and I would hate to see the standard rooms.  I will however commend how lovely the view is from the balcony - you do however get the same view from the drinks terrace at the front of the boat for £305 cheaper. (nearby hotels were £79 for the night with breakfast to put into perspective - without the river view of course)

The room itself is very basic... the carpets in our room were stained which i think is awful considering the price my partner and i paid to stay here (I've now also seen another review mentioning this!!  You would think the hotel would sort this!?)

The area itself, on the weekend at least, is very quiet i am told, as it is Business District.  We therefore opted for Room Service for breakfast which you must order the day before as we didn't want to have to make our way to somewhere more central on the tube before having breakfast.

I was really disappointed in the room service and wouldn't recommend it.

I had to phone Room Service to see where it was as it hadn't arrived at the allocated time, i gave it ten minutes before phoning and then was told that their order printing machine stopped working and they will get it to us ASAP.  It arrived shortly but you could tell it had been rushed - the order wasn't tailored to what i had ordered the night before and things from the tray were missing.

The ""toast"" was in fact bread, no butter for the bread (had to ask), no milk for the cereal and no cup for the tea just a pot of tea.  i ended up having to wash one of the room mugs that i had but used the night before.  These are simple things that really shouldn't be happening when you are paying £19.50 for a breakfast with a £4 service charge (What service i say!?)

Reception area looks very grand and front desk staff were polite but nothing above and beyond what you would expect.

Wouldn't stay here again.",2,2017,11,09
119,A room on the Thames...literally,"We stayed at the Sunborn Hotel at the end of October for one night. We were going to a concert at the O2 and wanted nearby accommodation. The Sunborn is a former cruise ship moored on the Thames. Our journey to the venue was via the cable car, which was a great way to arrive. 

Our room was spacious and well appointed. Breakfast the next day was very good and the view from the restaurant was stunning. We booked some months in advance so the cost for central London was reasonable. We would not hesitate to book it again.",4,2017,11,07
119,Had two nights here .,"Spent two nights here . The rooms are very quiet , I was a bit worried as there were lots of different stains on the carpet . We had a drink at the bar and was asked to go and sit down and the drinks would be brought over . Yes they were but a service charge for bringing them over . The bar area was ok  . Our room wasn't ready till 3 pm  no problem we popped out , when we came back at 3 there was a very big queue for people to check in . The room was nice and there was free water in the fridge . We were given a card to get a free glass of champagne and there were two of us a married couple , the man behind the bar said it was only for one . So I asked him to choose which one of us could have it . He gave us both one . We also had a problem in the bathroom when I turned the tap on to clean my teeth the water came out of a pipe , my feet and socks got soaking wet , so I had to wear socks for two days.  When I informed the staff there was no apology for me getting wet just that they would sort the leak out . We had a nice time .",3,2017,11,06
119,Great stay!,"Ideal location to stay for a concert at the O2. Nice quiet area. Really comfortable room overlooking the river. Lovely friendly staff. It’s a little bit different to stay on a yacht and a great thing to experience. 
And the best Mojito’s we have ever had! ",5,2017,11,06
119,Absolutely fantastic and cant wait to return!,"We absolutely loved this yacht hotel and was a fantastic surprise for my fiancées birthday:
-The staff were great
-The boat was so luxurious and lived upto expectations
-Location very quiet and away from the hussle and bussle
-Close to the O2 via Emirates skyline and only £4.50 pp per way bargain 👍🏻
-It was a great birthday surprise for my fiancée

My one and only criticism was the window in our room 1030 was filthy and seems as I paid for a river view room I genuinely expect a clear see through window, but instead it was very dirty! The prices that are charged for the rooms there could at least be a window cleaner in a rubber dinghy with a long handled cleaning rod of some sort.",4,2017,11,05
119,average stay with tasteless overpriced food,"Stay: Stayed for one night in the executive suit which is supposed to be best room, it was clean but furniture outdated. View is amazing and it's right next to Excel centre which I imagine would be crowded if there are events etc but in this occasion, surroundings were quiet so I would check that ahead of going.  Noisy fridge. 

Dinner: was awful and overpriced, while there was no one in the restaurant. The receptionist insisted that he needs to check if there is a table available!!! We had the sea bass and risotto both of which were microwave supermarket quality and cost £75 for two. While presentation was impressive, taste and quality was very low. The desert was slightly better. Breakfast was same experience. 

Spa treatment: no complains. My recommendation would be to go for the treatment and make a day off it on a day Excel is closed. Not worth the overnight stay or eating.",3,2017,11,05
119,A bit tired,"If you’re looking for some 80’s nostalgia this is the place for you.   The yacht is a bit tired looking, reminded us of the Shining film a little bit.  And they had ‘lift music’ playing in the corridors all night... we called to ask if they could turn it down so we could sleep, but it played on.... 

Not as grand as the photos, furniture and carpet all looked faded and stained in places...  a bit out the way too along the river so my wife said she wouldn’t want to walk along there alone at night 

Wouldn’t go back...",2,2017,11,04
119,Relaxing overnight stay,"Excellent place to unwind, easy to get to either using DLR or the Emirates cable car. Very grand interior, rooms good size and even a little veranda to sit on looking out across the water. Food in the restaurant was excellent and reasonably priced too.",5,2017,11,03
119,Excellent Hot and very good value for money,Cant compliment this hotel enough. The amenities were excellent (some of the best I have seen while travelling) and the doom was spacious and comfortable. Particularly liked the Nespresso machine included which went down well 😀. There isn't a car park due to location but you can park at he Royal Victoria Car Park which is a 5 minute walk for a flat rate of £15 for 24 hours. Other than parking not much else to really comment! ,5,2017,11,03
119,pleasantly Different!,"I stayed for one night on the Sunborn, A great experience waking up on a yacht looking across the Thames, the staff were attentive and helpful, the rooms clean with a very comfortable bed, very good free wifi, the only negatives would be the rate at which the breakfast buffet is restored, better monitoring of the amounts and speedy top ups wouldn't go a miss, carpets could do with an update throughout, otherwise a great alternative hotel, do not be put off by the above negative comments as they are minor, still very much worth a try.",4,2017,11,02
119,Fabulous!,"We booked here as it was next to Excel as we were visiting the boat show. Lobby was very grand with a sweeping staircase, bedroom was fab, large bed with seating area and loads of space. Ate in the bar in the evening as there is not that much around excel that appealed to us. Menu a bit limited, but food was good. Breakfast fab, would definitely stay again.",5,2017,11,01
119,The food was amazing and the service was outstanding!,"I was coming from my Law Graduation and I decided to have my celebratory lunch with my family at Sunborn. The waitress named Salomey was tremendously kind and hospitable. She was extremely professional while also quite jovial at the same time. It was very clear that she is generally a good person who definitely loves her job! The food was also well prepared and tasted amazing, along with the hot bread which was simply divine. I enjoyed my visit at the Sunborn very much and I will definitely return in the future.",5,2017,10,31
119,Nice afternoon tea but unsure on staff,"My friend and I decided on an impromptu afternoon tea for my birthday aboard the Sunborn
We arrived at 2.15pm and at first the receptionist just directed us upstairs advising most people book but we could go and ask. Upon entering the restaurant it was beyond obvious that there was plenty of availability- in fact only one table of 2 was occupied. Even then the waitress made a. Huge show of checking “where” we could sit, and apparently we couldn’t have a window seat. One thing that was initially annoying was the website advises the cost is £26, but when I asked I was told it was £30 per person as the website isn’t updated because the person who did it left his job!
We then asked for some tap water and we were told they don’t serve it! My friend needed to take some tablets and didn’t want to take them with tea, and after some too-Ing and fro-ing 
they brought a complimentary bottle of water.
The actual tea was lovely, very small finger sandwiches but nice tasty fillings, and refills on the sandwiches. We asked if we could choose the fillings ie extra egg instead of chicken, and we were told they were already made up- but then they made us additional egg in the refills! Not sure why we couldn’t have had that in the first place. Cakes were beautiful and the tea was plentiful.
Overall we had a nice afternoon but felt the staff were wary of us being there and it did feel a little uncomfortable- it was almost like we had inconvenienced them by turning up and not pre booking.
The views from the yacht are lovely and it did feel very luxurious in there, however it’s not cheap and they did add 12.5% service charge. 
I would have preferred to have been made to see a little more special- although I did get a happy birthday plate which was a nice touch.",4,2017,10,30
119,Birthday treat !,"Beautiful Floating Hotel, the hospitality was second to none, we had a fabulous night at this Hotel, the Al la Carte Menu was fantastic. Our cabin was a lovely suite overlooking the river the staff were attentive but unobtrusive. I would recommend this Hotel highly for a special occasion.",5,2017,10,29
119,Amazing!,"Booked our first stay at Sunborn Yacht in London for a birthday surprise for my boyfriend this weekend and we absolutely loved it!! Very clean, perfect room with a balcony and view of the Thames. Will definitely be back to stay again! Thank you! ",5,2017,10,29
119,A different place,"This is a great place to stay and so different from normal London hotels. Staff and facilities are great and the rooms (cabins) are large and well appointed. Price can be high but there are good deals to be had so check around. There is no parking so be prepared for a 5 to 15 min walk, having said that there are plenty of parking venues nearby. We’ll located with easy access to DLR and close to the Dome and Emirates cable car. Highly recommended. ",4,2017,10,26
119,Amazing Hotel,"We stayed here for our anniversary and what a lovely time we had. The hotel is so unusual, you feel like you are just going on a cruise, the decor is stunning with lots of glass, copper and crystal. Everything is shiny and clean and kept to a high standard. 
The staff were so helpful, warm and friendly especially Andrea on reception who was polite and efficient but at the same time friendly and warm. We were impressed with all the staff in fact they were all approachable, efficient, polite and friendly.
We loved the restaurant and bars including the staff 
Our room was really lovely with superb facilities and very clean. The bed was very comfortable, we slept so well.
It is obvious that our stay was brilliant and we loved every thing about this hotel, 
needless to say we look forward to when we can return",5,2017,10,24
119,Fabulous afternoon Tea,"

A very nice afternoon tea with great flavors and super good service.
We been visit here Friday 20/10/2017. 
The food was top-notch. We ordered traditional, vegetarian and under the sea afternoon Teas.  I especially liked the different breads used in the sandwiches. Each of them was delightful.The finger sandwiches there plentiful off filling, cut to perfection and you can taste the all freshness.Also very nice combination of chicken apple and tarragon. really love it.    
Sweet treats are plentiful through , the cupcakes were lovely and the scones were warm from the oven, it is definitely one of the best places in London for tea. We would definitely come here again and recommend it to others.",5,2017,10,23
119,Birthday Celebration ,"I had an awesome night at the Sunborn London hotel. Stayed for a night and had dinner at the Land End restaurant on the Yatch hotel. It was nothing less than magical. Service was fab, we was looked after by a beautiful young lady Salomey, she made us feel very welcome and as a vegan she really listened and gave extra options for our meal.

I’d highly recommend and if you like that extra attention, warm welcome with lots of charm and laughter request Salomey. 

I’ll be back soon.. ",5,2017,10,23
119,John,"I have got to say i was extremely impressed with everything at this hotel from the moment i walked in to the moment i checked out. Everything was great , the rooms are extremely spacious and the beds super comfy i will definately be visiting again and will 100% be reccomending it to my friends! Well done to all the staff ....... excellent !!!",5,2017,10,23
119,Average. ,"Customer service wasn’t the best. Our stay was all pre-booked online - breakfast included - however, due to a lack of communication they tried charging us for breakfast. Apart from this, breakfast was okay, with plenty to eat. The room was okay, it was large and had everything you need for a night, with just a few noticeable stains on the carpet. The food and drink was very pricey, with a £4 charge for room service. Not sure if I would stay again. ",3,2017,10,23
119,Wonderful ,"Me and my husband booked in here for 3 nights , it was absolutely beautiful we had a room with a balcony the room was lovely very spacious and had a living area , drinks are pricey however that was expected I didn't think the menu was a brilliant variety however it's close to many restaurants , also very close to the train/tube station 10 minute walk so we were out and about all around London very easily and stress free , the staff were lovely very welcoming and friendly , although it's on water it doesn't move so no need to worry about sea sick , highly recommend ",5,2017,10,19
119,Almost Excellent,"Sunborn London is a good hotel, probably very good. Its made more special by actually being a luxury yacht, and a very well appointed one at that. We stayed one night and went to the Neil Diamond concert at the O2 - just across the river by cable car or under the water by Blackwall Tunnel - which is fine unless the tunnel is jammed, which it was.

For Excel its a perfect location and its' nearly unique selling point of being a boat adds to the excitement (check out Good Hotel moored in the same dock). The cabin was luxurious with Lavazza espresso coffee on tap, a dock view and a very comfortable bed. The restaurant offers an early bird menu at the moment which is fantastic value with lovely gravadlax and a great saffron risotto, and works when you are going to a concert.....breakfast was relaxed with a good range of cold and hot options,

The downside is parking. If you don;t arrive by train or cab then you need to park, and the options are limited and a good 5 minutes away. £!5 overnight with no in/out options, so £15 again if you leave and return. I chose to book through justparking and found a great private space with secure parking and easy access 24 hours, but it was 7 or 8 minutes from the yacht.

Access to the hotel is normally via lift straight from the dockside. My wife does not 'do' lifts and the staff could not have been more helpful and attentive, rapidly responding to opening the secured access to a staircase.",4,2017,10,18
119,"Good, comfortable and quiet 4* Hotel","Good comfortable 4* hotel next door to Excel and 5min from DLR Royal Victoria and Emirates Skytrain to O2.
Very comfortable, peaceful (for London!) - good bed/shower and well appointed rooms, good night's sleep. bar/bar food was good - large choice of drinks. Didn't try the restaurant. Good breakfast. Can see that if the hotel is full, restaurant might be stretched - just need to make a reservation!",5,2017,10,18
119,Wife’s birthday weekend ,"Stayed 2 nights at the sunborn London for my wife’s and I can’t recommend this place enough. 
Everything was spot on, the room we had was an executive river view on the 5th floor which had amazing views of central London, the O2 and city airport. 
We ate in the lands end restaurant which was gorgeous and all the staff are really helpful and friendly. 
As it was my wife’s birthday we was invited to a V.I.P lounge for an hour of free drinks which was a really nice touch. 
Also on arrival in our room was a hand writing letter wishing us a pleasant stay and a happy birthday to my wife with some really nice chocolates 👌 
The yacht is docked in a nice quite part of the dock lands two minutes walk from the cable cars over to the O2 and river Thames ferry into central London. 
If you get a chance to stay here you won’t be disappointed !!! ",5,2017,10,17
119,Fantastic stay,"Stayed the 1 night with 3 course a la carte meal and breakfast.
First of all the bad that stopped me giving 5 stars.  All the staff were very friendly, however several of them didn't know what they were doing and had to be reminded, so service was often slow. (Drinks ordered in bar were forgotten, coffee ordered at breakfast was forgotten, then had no milk with that etc.). Not sure if they have a new batch of staff, but this was slightly annoying so stopped me giving what would otherwise definitely have been a 5 star review.  The hotel does have a wow factor and our room, executive river side, was fantastic. Spacious and very clean with good facilities.
Evening meal was superb, not a massive menu choice but what we had was really well cooked and very nice.  Bar after had a very nice ambience and we had a lovely restful sleep in very large comfortable bed.
Breakfast next day was lovely and fresh with good choice
Would return as its so well situated and a very nice stay overall",4,2017,10,16
119,Hidden Gem,"A stunning hotel that lacks some attention to detail. Check in was an enjoyable experience with a first class team on reception, I received a room upgrade when asked and the room was nice but nothing to take your breath away. Service in the lounge was not so good investment is needed in the F&B department, food took a long time to arrive and when it did it was cold, The lounge itself looks like a store room for spare furniture tables too low to eat from although small investment would make it amazing. Sadly the checkout was not so good and the lady on reception was miserable and thats a shame as the stay had been good. Would I stay again? definitely! Its a little out side of central London but good tube service as long as not having a late night. ",4,2017,10,15
119,Birthday treat. ,"All I can say is what an amazing experience.  From the delicious amazing lunch to our 2 nights aboard the Sunborn. 

The staff will look after you the moment you step off the elevator to the moment you leave. The rooms are divine with a lovely balcony to watch the world go by in India dock. 

My only grip would be that there is no parking close by. The multi storey is a 10 minutes walk but is reasonably priced for London and very secure. 

That shouldn’t put you off though. With a great transport network and an Uber will cost you £15 to the west end. It’s a great place to stay and enjoy a great time in London ",5,2017,10,15
119,Short brake,"Booked this fantastic yacht hotel as we were going to the  O2.

On approach this hotel gives you the wow factor. The entrance is through  a glass and brass elevator up to the reception and  the centre piece stairs WOW.

Check in was very quick directions to our room very clear and good.

Back into that fabulous elevator to our room but to go to any of the floors other than the reception and exit you need your room card to authorise the doors and elevators.

The corridors are all brass ceilings with no blemishes.

In to our room very spacious a super king size bed loads of storage and room polished brass and mirrors everywhere.

Food was top quality nosh to.

We will stay there again or at one of there other hotels around the world",5,2017,10,11
119,Glitch with reservation and cleanliness to list a couple,"Upon arrival we had an issue with our reservation not being on their system, the blame was pointed at us although having provided documents. The issue it seems was between Sunborn and Hotels.com. 
As a result we were informed 'we were lucky!' that there was a family room available. Unfortunately the carpet was heavily stained, curtains did not meet and let in alot of light from the balcony, a couple of bulbs had blown also. 
Had to make two visits to reception for the additional bedding for our child, and a further visit to reception, having received room service to find a drink missing. 
For the initial arrival issue we were offered a complimentary drink, however this we did not receive.
I have since sent the manager of the Sunborn London a letter of complaint some three weeks ago and not even an apology. 
Very poor and not what we were expecting for what was, supposed to be a big part of our City break.",2,2017,10,09
119,Outstanding Cocktails in Sundown Bar,"I visited Sundown Bar last afternoon with the friend of mine. 
It was our first visit there but definitely not the last one!
As soon as we entered the bar, staff made us feel very welcomed.
We were served by two  charming gentelmen, Julien - he looked like a manager, very polite and nice person. Second was a bartender named Daniele, he did fanastic job! Our drinks were delicious! His service was on the highest level.
What I can say is they both are right people on the right positions! Proffesional and very sklilled. We spent a lovely afternoon there.

I highly recommend this place! 
The view is amazing also!",5,2017,10,08
119,"Nice view, seeing London with the taste of ................................","I had a stayed there for one night to my amazed surprise the view was great but again very cold. The food was great, all thanks to chef. I could not ask for more transportation is required as the train station or taxi could not drive to the location. 

The services was out of this world, all smiles and great conversation with the staff. The room was large and comfortable. My next visit, we have to take my family with me maybe sail the yacht to the other side of the world.",5,2017,10,08
119,Night away,"Stayed on the Sunborn Yacht Hotel for one night and loved it Check was very quick and efficient, Our room was lovely very spacious and clean , everything you need even a proper coffee machine. Had a drink and light snack in the bar which was nice but very disappointed with the service , ordered our drinks at the bar but was told to go and sit down and they would bring them over..... what they don't tell you is they charge u for that !!! So after waiting half an hour I had to go and ask where our drinks were .  Same problem with the bar snack we ordered. That is my only fault everything else was great. ",5,2017,10,08
119,Massage + Champagne Afternoon Tea,"Despite being held up as staff was busy with other client, we lost about 10 mins of our massage time - you can bet, this was not made up for.

Massage was okay, rooms were not really that warm - and yes you should have warm rooms for massages! Then as rain poured down, the staff opened the blinds, which put in a lot of light in a room.. I don't know about everyone, but the massages I've had in the past had two things in common; warm room and dimmed lights for relaxation.

Another thing was the towels that they use to clean your face with.. it had that smell, where your clothes/towel does not dry properly - but the smell is then masked with cleansing oil/liquid.

--

Moving onto the Afternoon tea, the restaurant was quiet, had 2-3 other occupied tables, fantastic - less noise and more staff help! :)

Salomey was fantastic, carefully tended our needs and even gave my partner a mini surprise drawing of Hello Kitty (good attempt), thank you to the kitchen staff too!

Definitely a place worth going, just a couple of minutes walk from the Emirates Cable Cars and London Excel itself - but a little unsure about the facilities for the massage.",4,2017,10,08
119,Afternoon tea - Amazing service!,"Where do I starts, the yacht is absoloutely beautiful ! The service from beginning to end was amazing, we were treated like king and queen and the lady who served us was fantastic- I’ve unfortunately lost the card I had with her name written down but it was at 2pm on Saturday 30th September. For the afternoon tea we went for the under the sea option. There was crab , lobster and cod sandwiches. I’m always let down by the sandwiches at these kinda things but these were lovely. The reason I have marked down 1 is that I think the scones definitely need a lot of improvement, they were bit size and literally rock solid, we struggled to cut through them. The cakes were lovely especially the millionaires tart- to die for! 
So many teas were provided and we made our way through most of the flavours with the help of our lovely waitress. 

Thank you very much for a wonderful time!!! ",4,2017,10,07
119,Birthday Gift,"We spent one night here for a birthday gift.
It was easier to get to than I had thought as the DLR is only a short walk away.
The room was large and comfy, there were a few marks on the carpet but they would of meant the carpet being replaced as they were heavy stains, but that didn’t distract from the comfort.
The breakfast was a bit expensive but very tasty.
I would visit here again and maybe stay a bit longer as it’s a good base to explore London from and is a good talking point with friends.",5,2017,10,07
119,Lovely hotel ,"It’s often quite difficult to find a hotel in London which is reasonably priced, on the river, quiet location and of good quality and this place is one! Is a real 4 star hotel, has everything you need to make your stay comfortable (good coffee machine, robes, slippers, Molton brown toiletries, large baths towels, good shower and a very large, comfy bed). Best of all we had a room with a balcony over the river so great to sit and have your morning coffee on. 
We were going to the O2 in the evening so we took the cable car which was a 4 min walk to the nearest stop and also a nice way to travel in the evening . ",5,2017,10,06
119,Business trip,"My partner and I stayed here on business for 2 nights. We were exhibiting at the Excel so was a perfect location. 
The yacht needs updating in my opinion but my partner liked the classic look. 
It was clean and spacious. We had a room with a balcony which was nice. 
It is expensive to drink there but the food and drinks were nice. 
Staff were lovely. 
I probably wouldn't stay here again as I like more of a modern look and too expensive for drinks. 
Apart from that it was a nice stay. ",4,2017,10,05
119,Wow,"We visited Saturday evening for night out in London .What a fantastic evening .Friendly staff and great food .Lovely view.Highly recommend this place to everyone .Also they have rooms and they look great .
Will return very soon .👍

",5,2017,10,03
119,Excellent place for a getaway break...yet right in the heart of things ,"Loved this yacht experience. Class hotel ...we were lucky to avail of sunshine experience while we were here. Highly recommended for an adult holiday...not sure what it has to offer children, however. But it’s a two-minute walk to train so plenty of London offers. ",5,2017,10,03
119,Pleasant stay,"Booked this for my partners 21st birthday, and had an overall lovely and charming experience.
We stayed on the fourth floor in an executive room with riverside view, the room wasn't extremely modern but in a way I enjoyed the interior as sometimes its better to keep it basic.
The bed was really comfy, however the pillows were a little tough to sleep on but this can be overlooked.

My only bad points to make about the hotel is the balcony, I believe I paid at least £50 extra to have a balcony in the room and it was very disappointing. As I walked out I expected something more spacious, but instead it is about a metre from the hotel room door to the edge of the balcony meaning you can just about stand outside. Because you was so restricted it almost felt scary to stand outside because you was so close to the edge of the balcony without even trying to be.
The view however is still amazing despite the small width of the balcony.

Another downside was the shower, it was quite weak and the water was lukewarm rather than nice and hot ( I put it up to its highest temperature).
The floor in the bathroom is heated though which was also a nice feature.
Overall the staff are really friendly, and the view/atmosphere is really lovely within the hotel.
Would definitely stay again!",4,2017,10,02
119,Great experience,"The hotel has excellent customer service, very spacious rooms, comfy beds, the food and drinks are delicious. I was not disappointed by anything and we spent a lovely wedding anniversary and we will definitely return.",5,2017,10,02
119,Wonderful and Relaxing,"We have just spent our wedding anniversary weekend here with friends .... 1st impressions were wow what a beautiful yacht and setting as we walked up to the mooring. Then in all honesty it just got better. The staff we're totally amazing, very professional,friendly and extremely efficient in every area. The rooms were big and very clean. The bar staff were great and kept asking if were enjoying ourselves ..... all in all I could not fault this place at all .. I would recommend and definitely return again.",5,2017,10,02
119,Afternoon tea. Underwhelmed ,"So after being blown away with the photos, I am sad to say I was underwhelmed upon first impression from the outside upon arrival. Perhaps it's more of a night thing but on a Saturday afternoon you first approach and are met with a coat of green algae to the rear. It's a shame to pick such particular detail but at these prices it's to be expected, come on guys get the mop and buckets out!. When you get inside and are greeted by a majestic staircase things look up. The decor in the restaurant is a little dated and there were some bubbles in the paintwork but again, nitpicking. The location is great and it's in general a nice experience and something a little different. Salomey who served us was the best part of the whole experience. She was charming, attentive and went way above and beyond to make sure we had a nice meal. We went to scope the Sunborn as a potential wedding venue and unfortunately it hasn't me my expectations. The food was 'nice' but we did only have the afternoon tea and sandwiches. Oh and a cocktail... We checked out a bedroom which was very nice, perhaps the main draw of the sunborn is to spend the night? The bar behind the reception is seriously lacking in character and any kind of charm. A bit more like a waiting room which relies on the terrace area to save is grace. We was going to sit for a drink but chose to leave instead as the terrace was dominated by smokers. In all it was nice, would I go for afternoon tea again, Probably not, but I would like to try a room and see it at night and hope that changes my opinion ",3,2017,10,01
119,An alternative London hotel,"This is a smashing hotel for a romantic break in London. I wouldn't fault the accommodation, in any way. The room was spacious and quiet. The bar area has an outside terrace with views of Canary Wharf and the O2, plus the Emirates cable car. Our room was booked well in advance and we got a good price which made the sunborn good value for money. But, the food and drink on board were expensive. The nearest rail station is a short, pleasant walk away. The cable car is even closer which makes the O2 and Greenwich very accessible. Not a great deal to do in the immediate area, but nevertheless somewhere we would use again, when visiting London.",4,2017,09,30
119,Cruiseless cruise,"Planning a visit to ExCel centre this popped up so with a group of friends we decided to give it a go.
The 'cabins' were huge. The bathroom small but very practical and proximity to ExCel - perfect.
We dined on board and the food, service and ambience was very good.
The views from our window table,over London, 02 arena and the pretty red lights of the Emirates Air Line were stunning. Our lovely waitress insisted we go out on deck for photos and they are amazing with that backdrop.
All in all our cruiseless cruise on Sunborn Yacht was very good.",4,2017,09,29
119,A wonderful treat,"My husband and I visited the Sunborn as a birthday treat. We upgraded on check in to a balcony room including breakfast and thought for an extra £50 it was very good value.  We had the under the sea afternoon tea served with a glass of Veuve cliquot champagne which was lovely. In the afternoon we had a body massage at the spa by very professional staff. Our day was finished off with a delicious evening meal.  Our experience at this hotel was faultless, the members of staff were courteous and professional.  Our cabin/room was spacious, well equipped and very clean, the bed was lovely and comfortable and the view over the river was pleasant. We would definitely stay here again.
Thank you Richard and Lorna!",5,2017,09,26
119,Perfect location for a visit to the Excel,"Very good quiet location, however near to restaurants and dock lands light railway station for easy ride into the city
Very generous sized rooms which were very clean.
Molton Brown toiletries provided 
Good breakfast served by very efficient but pleasant staff",5,2017,09,24
119,Surprise 50th birthday celebrations!,"Just spent a fabulous night on this yacht with 2 special friends, 1 celebrating a golden birthday. From the moment we arrived, we were taken care of by very friendly staff who helped us execute the birthday surprise with finesse. They decorated our room for 3, put a bottle of champers on ice & played along to perfection with the suprise. The room was spacious with a large double bed & large sofa bed-both very comfy. We were lucky enough to have an outlook over the water so were able to sit on our balcony sipping the champagne before we went out for dinner. The lunch we had beforehand on the aft deck was lovely-the food, service & drinks including a freebie were excellent. A great experience all round with superb customer service/care & the great British weather playing a blinder. This yacht is smaller than the one in Gib I stayed on last December but still has the luxury of the Sunborn brand. We'll be back, thank you!",5,2017,09,24
119,I was a exhibitor at excels a great place to stay,"2 mins walk fro excel,just what I wanted after a hard day at Lunch show, to relax with colleges ,sat on the deck relaxing with a drink looking at the lights of London in the distance.
The reception staff were friendly and very quick in booking me in ,I arrived at 12.30,lunch time and did not expect my room to be ready but it was waiting for me.
The room was spacious and clean,the toiletries in the bathroom of the highest quality,,,wifi was available ,plus all the extras you would expect in a high class hotel.
Only had breakfast on board but this was good with plenty of variety to chose from -again staff were very professional.
I spent 2 nights on board Sunborn on business, would would come again ,this time bringing my wife.
The only slight irritation I had was the bar closed at 12..00 -midnight ,but we overcame this purchasing before it closed",5,2017,09,24
119,Interesting place to stay but service terrible,"We booked the Sunborne because it was close to the Excel and it looked like a fun place to stay. The rooms were large, clean and comfortable. The staff were polite but the service was terrible. Waiting for a drink in the bar you could die of thirst. We resorted to going to the bar ourselves the first day, as table service was just so slow. The second day when we went to the bar, we were told that we were not permitted to buy drinks there and had to have the table service! Again, very slow and to top it off, they charge you an extra £2 for the privilege. Also, no Gordon's Gin!! Who ever heard of a bar without Gordons?",3,2017,09,24
119,Stayed for 1 night wish it was more,"Stayed for 1 night to see a show at the O2. When walking in you are greeted to a stunning lobby and the friendliest staff. I was a bit disappointed that check in wasn’t until 3:00 which I thought was rather late. They were happy to take my bags whilst I went out sight seeing and they even put them in my room for me when it was ready. Near by parking is at the ExCeL, only thing about this is that it’s hard to find your way out to get to the hotel and also you can only buy your parking in 24 hour amounts.
The room was comfy and cosy, huge bed, decent sized bathroom.
Really close to the Emirates AirLine and Canning Town tube station. Will definitely stay again. Sandra on the front desk was very friendly and helpful",4,2017,09,23
119,"Fabulous place to stay, friendly, welcoming - upgraded to a suite as special occasion - thank you.","As it was my wives 50th birthday we were upgraded to a suite - absolutely fantastic.  Room was large, comfortable and luxurious.  Lovely views across the dock.  Hotel is extremely convenient for the excel center and docklands airport.   Reception staff helpful, especially Andrea.",5,2017,09,23
119,Birthday celebration ,"We spent one night on the yacht to celebrate my daughter's 30th birthday.
I had read some mixed reviews but I can say I was not disappointed and it lived up to my expectations.
The decor in reception area was really beautiful. Only one of our rooms were ready on arrival so we left all our cases in the one room. We had a drink and lunch in the bar area which was really nice and reasonably priced. My daughter had a facial in the beauty room there which she throughly enjoyed. Once my room was ready we went to unpack. I had paid £25 to have the room decorated with balloons and banners and they also put birthday confetti on the table along with a money off voucher for our first lot of drinks.
The room was lovely and spacious. The only thing we didn't like was the room was too warm in the night even though we tried sorting out the air conditioning out.
We didn't have dinner that evening on the yacht we went ate nearby. There are a few restaurants to choose from.
In the morning we opted for the early breakfast saver which is just £7.50 each. There was a wide selection of things to eat but we found the full English breakfast barely warm which was a shame.
Overall I loved it and would definitely go there again .",4,2017,09,23
119,Great place to stop next to Excel,"By chance saw this lovely boat and went inside to be nosey. Five hours later after a bite to eat and some Pimms on the terrace.....
I'm putting this on my bucket list to stay over with a private balcony 😉",5,2017,09,22
119,Doesn't deliver,"Booked direct with hotel one night including romantic package for wedding anniversary. Great location and easy parking at excel but downhill from there. No complimentary room upgrade, no drink on arrival, no 15% off food and drink all promised on website.  And worst of all no romantic package in room on arrival! Utterly disappointing although staff tried to rectify it by throwing some petals and swan towels on the bed and 4 tiny chocolates. Not worth the extra £40. Given voucher for glass of bubbly by staff that were very pleasant but it had lost the special occasion feeling by then. Room was lovely and the planes can be a little noisy but could do so much better. ",2,2017,09,22
119,Something different,"Booked afternoon tea for sisters birthday. Lovely concept and surroundings, helpfully staff. Wasn't overly impressed with the sandwiches and cakes etc but the surroundings made up for it. Would I go back....No:(",4,2017,09,21
119,Location Location Location ... but what about breakfast ????,"I was recommended here by my sister as we wanted a hotel for one night, close to the O2 as we were seeing the Foo Fighters.

This hotel is different, VERY different, its a boat (sorry Yacht).   Easy to get to for us as we drove, and there is bags of parking at the Excel centre for £20 for 24hours.

The boat (sorry Yacht) looked amazing and check in (via a complicated lift) was very pleasant, staff very helpfull about the hotel, its facilities and how to get to and from the 02 via different routes.  The reception area was all glass and gold with a bar overlooking the river and the O2.

We had a room on the 1st floor (deck ??) for £133 for one night, bearing in mind this is right next to an IBIS and a Novotel it was about £30 - £50 more but we chose to splash out (although hoping to stay dry !!).  

The room was VERY nice, quite large, nice bathroom with big shower cubicle.  Molton Brown toiletries, wood everywhere (some may think it looks a little dated) and a nice big port hole overlooking the water.

So off we went to the 02 via the Emirates cable car, Foo Fighter were AWESOME and back via the DLR.  all very easy and relaxing.    The bar was shut (but was almost 1am ) so off to bed we went.  Nice large bed and good nights sleep.

We got up and decided to have breakfast on board, despite a few Cafes along the water front offering full english for well under a tenner.   Off we went to the restaurant and sat overlooking the 02, the river and central london ..... lovely.    Breakfast turned out to be a buffet self service, which is ok and we made a start.  We did have to ask if there were more scrambled aggs as they were empty and there were only two bits of bacon left.   As we started to eat we were presented with the bill to sign.  

Now I realise that breakfast was not included but I was a little shocked at £19.50 .....  EACH !!

Here is my issue.  VALUE !!   I am ok to pay £19.50, but for that I would have expected a choice of eggs and food made to order, table service, proper fresh orange juice and decent toast, none of which we got.  As I said we had to ask for more eggs, other couples we heard asking for bacon, hashbrowns etc as things ran out.   This should have been topped up by the staff before customers had to ask.  The orange juice was cheap concentrate, the bread cheap sliced bread with one toaster (although to be fair one waitress did help and became the toast queue cooker).

So - will i go back .... probably, the location is GREAT, the room lovely and comfy, but i'll stroll up the road and have a fry up for about a fiver !!",3,2017,09,21
119,One night stay,"We stayed for one night in one of the two suites. We chose the suite with a riverside view. The suite was well appointed and clean, the bed was comfortable. So no complaints about the accommodation. The only meal that we had in the hotel was breakfast, and that was not good. The full English breakfast was only warm at best, the mushrooms were dry, the bacon poor quality and the scrambled egg awful. We decided to stay here for the experience of something different, but will not be rushing back. From the short time that we were there the staff that we met were helpful and pleasant enough.",3,2017,09,20
119,Dated ,"Stayed one night. Was like I had walked onto the set of a Dynasty/Dallas episode. All very clean but suppose just not my taste. Lots of dated 80s gold, peach and glass which some people might love. If you hate lifts avoid this place like the plague as I don't see how you have any choice. Annoyingly they play loud music in the corridors at night-easily audible from the room. No-one answered the phone in reception, room service or concierge. I find this very odd as must annoy lots of people. Didn't have breakfast so can't comment. ",3,2017,09,19
119,WOW,"This was an extra special treat for a 50th birthday and it didn't disappoint the inside of the yacht was amazing, the room was fantastic, the only small issue was the loud noise coming from what seemed was the top of the ship a type of engine sound but apart from this I couldn't fault it, the staff were friendly and helpful the room was clean and the setting was great it was a bit of luxury that I had wanted.",5,2017,09,19
119,Lovely place for a perfect occasion,"Very nice hotel, clean, attentive staff, could not fault it. Dinner was good as well. Steak was nice and a rose brut with strawberry notes was yummy. Enjoyed every minute of my birthday celebratio. Hotel I conveniently located close to London Excel centre.",5,2017,09,18
119,Amazing,"I had a lovely experience at this hotel using a spa and afternoon tea package. The scenery is beautiful and relaxing. The service was exceptional especially by our waitress Salomey. She was very attentive to me and my friend and she provide excellent customer service which made our experience at the hotel even better. One thing I was disappointed about is that there was no pool at the hotel. However, that was due to me not researching the hotel properly. Other than not having a pool or sauna the spa is still great and so is the afternoon tea (the salmon sandwich and the collection of tea were superb). I would definitely recommend this spa and hotel and would definitely go back. Thank you Salomey for your great customer service. I really appreciated it 😊",5,2017,09,18
119,Anniversary treat,"Stayed for 1 night to celebrate our wedding anniversary. Bed super comfy & room spacious. We had afternoon tea with champagne.  It was a little disappointing not to have the afternoon tea served on the nautical stand as advertised. The sandwiches/ cakes were good. We asked for more sandwiches which were served with a smile.  We were also presented with an anniversary plate which was a lovely gesture. 
Evening meal was a special event dinner which was 4 courses,  all of which were delicious & beautifully presented. Service was first class . There were  Motown/ soul singers performing in the bar area who were really good. Breakfast was lovely and at £7.50 weekend (if dined before 9am ) was great value . 
Loved every thing about this hotel I  would highly recommend. ",5,2017,09,17
119,Just stayed one night,"What a fantastic hotel. We were with a coach tour , and stayed overnight on a bread and breakfast stay. 
The room we had was lovely with a porthole window overlooking the Thames . The furnishing in the room was excellent . Fantastic coffee maker. We didn't eat our evening meal there as it was too expensive, but there are plenty of restaurants nearby as we were in Dockland . It was just a lovely, lovely hotel. Would we go again ? Yes I would. As a matter of fact we have been there three times, with the same tour company. We weren't sure what the charge for the room was.  As we were with a tour company , and I presume they were charged at a cheaper rate, and it was a Sunday night stopover .",5,2017,09,17
119,Very Average,I stayed here for a romantic break. We were going to the O2 for an event so the hotel is quite handy in that respect as you can access the cable car which is a 5 minute walk from the hotel. Otherwise there is nothing much in the area where the Sunborn is moored. A handful of restaurants. When we arrived it took quite a while to check in as there was a queue and only 2 receptionists. I booked an executive suite dockside through Booking.com which having spent a night in the room was I thought very over priced. Particularly because it didn't include breakfast which was an extra £20 each. The communal areas like the reception and the restaurant were nice but the room was underwhelming. The room decor was old fashioned and tired rather like a P&O ferry then a plush luxury yacht. The room was billed as a having a balcony but realistically who wants to sit on a balcony which has room for only 2 fold up seats with a view of the Excel centre - not me ! On the plus side the service was very good in the bar. I think there were a few guests on Group on or some kind of meal deal which was probably much more VFM then my booking. Overall I wouldn't rush back. ,3,2017,09,17
119,Disappointing ,"This was supposed to be a 4 star luxury yatch.  Having stayed overnight, sadly it wasn't the experience we expected.   The room carpet was covered in stains and spillages (and I do mean covered and not just the odd dot).  The window was so dirty you struggled to see out of it. We did have a wonderful King size bed, unfortunately, let down by the basic bedding that didn't fit. Guess who struggled to get some duvet cover!  The Yatch is a wonderful concept but the standard of the rooms and general tiredness of the carpets and decor let it down.  
We also had the dinner package at £95pp inc a glass of champagne.  Effectively you get the 3 course set menu with an Amuse Bouche (this costs £32 during the week). The package was to include a live band, which was 2 singers who had finished their set when we came out of the restaurant.  
The crab starter was delicious (despite still having some shell in it and was husband's duck salad was wonderful.  My sea bass had amazing flavours but was a bit overcooked and not very warm.  Hubby's beef was better (think my dish had waited for his) and cooked perfectly.
Both desserts, lemon tart and lemon cheesecake were to die for.
Overall there are some real glimmers of class but for £500+ for dinner and an overnight stay I've experienced a lot better.  I would come for dinner when serving the set menu but wouldn't bother with the stay or dinner package again.  ",3,2017,09,17
119,Anniversary treat! ,I pre booked the sunborn  Hotel by the Exel a week before our anniversary and arrived at reception to check in to our room in time for having a meal with them.  I then realised that i had booked the room and the restaurant on the wrong day! The reception staff were fantastic they moved our reservation to that day and the meal and they gave us a bottle of wine with our meal to celebrate our special day.  The food was Delicious and the views over Canary wharf was breath taking.    The rooms are finished to a very high standard as the rest of the yacht.  We asked the waiter where to go in London and he suggested some lovely venues that made our special day even better.  Very impressed with the staff and the hotel Facilities.  We have recommended them and will be back!! ,5,2017,09,14
119,Luxury Surroundings,"Came here on a Groupon deal. Lovely furnishings, room with a balcony overlooking the excel. Dinner was very tasty, but tiny portions as this type of ""a la Carte"" food always is. Have snacks ready back in your room! 👍 Friendly helpful staff, you can leave your luggage with them early, pre booking in 👍 The morning breakfast was self serve buffet and nice quality.  A nice glamorous stay, with lovely decor. Would go again on a deal, but not at full price. Enjoy",5,2017,09,14
119,Just perfect!,"We visited as a surprise birthday present for a lovely friend. Easy check in, room lovely with all amenities including a fab coffee maker. Bar area lovely and we also had the VIP experience on the 5th Floor - views phenomenal. Ate at the Lands End restaurant and the food was superb - never had a steak so perfectly cooked. All the staff are excellent and we would highly recommend this for a special event.",5,2017,09,14
119,Cannot Fault! ,"My partner took me here for my birthday and everything from the room to the food and service exceeded my expectations.  We stayed in an executive suit where the size of the bed was bigger than I have ever slept in before - heaven!!  The shower was amazing which I didn't expect on a yacht :)
I have dined at many fine food restaurants and this was up there with some of the top!
Thank you Sunborn staff, a truly amazing experience!",5,2017,09,12
119,Special birthday in a fantastic hotel,I took my mum to Sunborn Yacht Hotel for her 80th birthday in mid week ahead of her party at the weekend. It was a fabulous stay. We had a beautiful spacious room that had been decorated with birthday wishes. Our cake was just as ordered. Our meal in the evening was delicious. We enjoyed every aspect of our stay and it was therapeutic and calming ahead of a very big party that weekend. Since returning home we found Sunborn had also given us a card for complimentary Champagne too. Wish we'd read that message carefully so we would have enjoyed that too. Sunborn made my mum's birthday very special and we'll definitely return in the near future. Thank you Sunborn.,5,2017,09,10
119,What a shame ,"I visited the restaurant midweek. Made a last minute booking thinking it was fully booked. But it was no problem. Asked for a table with a view, which was also no problem. This should have set the alarm bells ringing. The restaurant was empty bar two tables. The decor was a bit dated, service was great, but it was empty. Tables were a bit too low, so you had lean forward to eat. Fantastic setting, but unfortunately the chef has let the restaurant down. Good presentation but the food was ok at best. The restaurant has the makings of a great success, simply sack the chef. Would I go again, I doubt it. It's  a real shame. ",1,2017,09,09
119,Very special,One of the most amazing and unique hotels I have ever stayed at. The place itself was beautiful and the staff were very friendly. I felt as if I was on a cruise. It was very near the nearest train station and shops. We can't wait to come back for our anniversary!! I would definitely recommend especially if you are in a couple or used to a certain standard on a business trip.,5,2017,09,09
119,Delightful Evening with a View,"My partner and I recently spent an evening dining at the Land's End Restaurant and then ended up drinking the night away at the Sun Down Bar. The dining experience was rather incredible - the cuisine, service and ambience was all on point! Not to mention the incredible views of the Canary Wharf landscape! Can't wait to return!",5,2017,09,09
119,A wonderful day out!,"Where to start with this - Sunborn made our day a very enjoyable from start to finish. We were booked in for a full body massage each where the lovely Joanna took good care of us, followed by drinks on the terrace and a champagne afternoon tea. All of the staff were so friendly and accommodating, the atmosphere in that place is lovely. The food was absolutely outstanding, the best afternoon tea I have had by far!! 
A massive thank you to everyone their who made it a special day for us, we most definitely will be returning! :)",5,2017,09,07
119,Romantic weekend,"Beautiful room in a lovely setting, car park 5 minutes walk away, ideal location for train to underground 15 minutes to attractions. Cafe's and bars along the dock, there was a lovely little café doing full English Breakfast £7.",5,2017,09,06
119,A Real Treat with a Difference,We spent 2 nights at the Sunborn celebrating our wedding anniversary. The setting is excellent and to be on-board a rather large boat was a real treat. I have to say the quality of the surroundings met our expectations. The room was very nice and the bed incredibly comfortable. The public areas are equally good and it was great to be able to sit and have a drink out on the deck. Our only disappointment was the dinner in the restaurant which fell short of what we would have expected for the price. A pity really. Overall though we would certainly recommend the hotel for a special occasion with a difference.,5,2017,09,06
119,Nice hotel,"Great hotel. Really comfortable bed, spacious room. Great nights sleep, sofa in the room to work from. Local restaurants and train stations nearby for easy access. Would definitely stay there again and would highly recommend. ",4,2017,09,06
119,Birthday Dinner,"A wonderful experience, a great evening and a night to remember - we booked the sky lounge (giving us exclusive access to the sky lounge deck) for the evening, which was beautifully arranged for us by the Sunborn staff. The welcome by the staff was very friendly and they were very attentive to us through the evening - we moved seamlessly from cocktails to dinner. The food was quite good and pleasant, and attractively served. An absolutely splendid evening. I would go back again for another event and recommend the venue to anyone looking for great ambience, class and elegance.",5,2017,09,06
119,A Tale of 2 Ratings,"This is where I wish i could rate in more detail.

We booked Sunborn for a one night stay while we were in London to Depeche Mode at the QE Stadium. Rather than book a Premier Travel Inn or similar, we found the Sunborn was only about £30.00 more so gave it a try.

Location is great and the yacht looks great from the outside. Inside the first thing we found, as we entered the lift, was a strong smell of hydraulic hot oil - need to get that sorted.

We have nice room - very spacious with good view. Carpet was a very light colour and did show up various marks - plus we got somebody's trainer in the bin.

Had a good nights sleep. Breakfast was fine  - not outstanding just the usual buffet affair.

Overall as a stand-in for a Premier Inn i was quite happy - as a luxury break I'd probably have been a little disappointed. Would I use it again - if the price was right yes.",3,2017,09,04
119,One night birthday treat on plush yacht hotel overlooking the Thames,"First given rooms on 1st floor, noisy,asked for rooms higher so got 2 on 2nd floor,quieter,very large with king size beds,bathroom with walk in shower,sofa in room,lovely view of river with kayaks.  Dining room excellent food very expensive but service excellent. Breakfast buffet style,nice table near window,all in all very enjoyable time.",5,2017,09,03
119,"Great location, beautiful place to stay but beware....","The Royal Victoria Docks are beautiful and the yacht is wonderfully placed.  Our room was wonderful, had views out over the water and we loved the big bed and comfortable accommodation.  We had dinner in the restaurant on the yacht (a different review for this) and we used the bar on the 3rd floor later in the evening - here also we were well pleased. 
However the one thing I would point out is that we were landed with a £40 ""service charge"" I had not been made aware of (neither on Booking.com nor by the hotel staff the day we checked in), so that was a nasty surprise.  This drove the price up for the one night to above £200, which seemed decidedly overpriced. Also, the breakfast was decidedly average for such an allegedly posh hotel.",4,2017,09,01
119,Anniversary ,"Stayed one night on the yacht hotel for our wedding anniversary and absolutely loved it. The staff were so helpful, friendly and could not do enough for us. 
The room was large clean and luxurious with most facilities you would expect from this level of hotel. 

The setting was fantastic and exactly how I would expect a super type yacht to be. 

We had dinner in the restaurant the food was great and again the staff superb, we had drinks in the afternoon in the lounge bar great service.  The view from both the bar and restaurant overlooking canary wharf and the city is fantastic.
In my opinion the prices whilst not cheap are as you would expect for this standard of hotel in the location. 

If there is a negative it would be there could be more facilities generally on the yacht but taking into account the proximity to London and Canary Wharf and that they offer it is understandable the lack of extra facilities that said there are loads of bars and restaurants very close 

Will stay again but will try the sister yacht hotel in Gibraltar first 

",4,2017,08,31
119,Fabulous experience ,"Stayed for a couple of days for husband's birthday. Had a cabin with river view - so quiet - could hardly believe we were in London. Large, very comfortable room with nice toiletries and large fluffy towels in bathroom. Lovely large hot shower. We sat out on deck for drinks which was great. Bar staff very friendly but so were most of the staff. The hairdryer in the bathroom was a little sensitive and cut out at times during use.  There was complimentary tea and coffee (using a coffee machine) - a little bitter for me but nice touch. Only complaint- the cups provided in the room need to be larger for tea. Fabulous unique experience. Loved it. ",5,2017,08,31
119,This is an OVERPRICED / GLORIFIED MOTEL..pls STAY AWAY!- PLS READ,"This is the best advise/review you will ever get-for this place-  My day job is to review products/services pls stay away from this atrocious place called a hotel.

DISSAPOINTING & AWFUL experience @ the sunborn yacht hotel London

What a disastrous and disappointing stay @ the sunborn yacht hotel London! For a hotel that prides its self as 5 stars

I should have known all along that this was going to be a disaster from the point of booking when it took several phone calls to get my invoice sent to my email. 

On the day of arrival I called the official contact number severally to inform of my late check in to no avail- on arrival at the hotel i rang again severally to ask for directions to the nearest car park no answer ( extremely frustrating)- @ the time of check-in I brought this to the attention of front desk to ensure they check that their phone was working

How on earth can a five star forget to secure staff over the Bank Holiday!

Little did I know this was the beginning of a horror stay

We eventually checked in, there was a 40£ prepayment for miscellaneous, which seemed fine at the time, we eventually got settled in our room, there was no minibar, no robes, no slippers!. We wanted to have dinner we were told there was no availability for dinner we were left with no other option but to wander round in search for food; we got given a voucher for 2 complimentary drinks. Did I forget to mention the bed was extremely terrible we woke up with horrible back aches the bed was awful and should be thrown out  bed was lopsided- we reported this to the front desk and lady was unapologetic about this telling us that there has been no complain.

@ The time of booking according to the website we could get;

 Complimentary Upgrade to next room Category (Subject to availability) 
- Complimentary welcome drink each on arrival* 
- 15% OFF Food & Beverages during your stay 
- 25% OFF treatments in our symphony treatment rooms. 

 
The morning of check out called room service no answer and no call return appalling!- I have never experienced such 

@ the time of check out I went to the front desk to authorize the transaction for  our stay & I was advised that I had to pay extra on top of the miscellaneous to cover the payment for the spa.  I had to bring it to the lady’s attention that I had 25% OFF treatments @ the spa, she then offered to refund me the excess which was fine. ( The symphony spa was the only decent thing about my stay)

We decided to redeem our complimentary drinks, we handed our voucher to the bartender and we had our drinks which we thought was complimentary at time and also had some food- when our bill was brought to us we had both drinks and full price of food included in the receipt, I had to remind the bartender that the complimentary ticket was handed in and we also were entitled to 15% off food, he went and brought back the revised bill. (clearly the staffs are not communicating with each other properly and also not informed)

I had to scrutinise every detail- you don’t deserve that headache when you book a relaxing break.

on top of this Front Office Manager is extremely condescending / non challant I was offered as a gesture if I do decide to come back -I will never be going back
'A complimentary upgrade  which is a part of the usual terms when one books directly from the website this isn't a gesture in any way & 'complimentary breakfast' which i find absolutely ridiculous and insulting! 'the break fast will never repair the horrible stay  & damage done to our back.

I mentioned in our email exchange that I will  be posting my reviews on all the review websites & across all the social media channels

response from front office manager- 'It is everyone’s free will to share the experience and the comments with other travellers and you are also more than welcome to do so'

I am not looking for any blanket response as seen in comments, this hotel needs to be investigated & rated a 2 star!",1,2017,08,31
119,Good spot for 1 night stay,"Staff: : Reception and house keeping: helpful and professional 
Rooms- nice , clean - I would recommend  river view because dock view isn't very attractive 
Best point: rear deck ( cafe, cocktail bar)- spectacular views ! 
Location: good for 1 night 
Car park- 2 car parks nearby.",4,2017,08,31
119,A few surprises!!,"I booked this as a special treat to celebrate hubbys 50th Birthday. We thought it would be something to remember and it will be but not all for the right reasons.

This is advertised as a luxury yacht hotel, something beautiful and a certain standard is expected. The first shock was that you enter via a lift! Now being claustrophobic this caused me a panic, no way was I getting on the boat! However, once hubby went up and explained the staff were very helpful and let me in the fire escape via a small ramp. Problem solved and they were pretty ok about letting me go out that way as long as a member of staff accompanied me. A little inconvenient but better than getting in the lift!!
The second disappointment was probably not something most people will encounter. As hubby is disabled we phoned to make sure there was parking. We were told that it would be no problem at all but after going out for dinner there were no spaces left. We had to leave the car in a non disabled space. The manager assured us that if it was clamped or towed they would deal with it! Not really very reassuring but was the best they could do! Luckily neither happened.
That aside, this is a beautiful yacht. The room, dockside executive, was large and clean. There was water in the fridge, lots of tea and gorgeous coffee machine. The bed was huge and super comfortable. There are lots of nice touches like blackout curtains with good double glazing to keep the plane noise out. Lovely Molten Brown toiletries and dressing gowns and slippers.

 Breakfast was buffet style and very nice. Good range of the usual so sure to be something for even the fussiest of eaters to enjoy.

Overall we enjoyed our stay and if the chance arose, would probably stay again.",4,2017,08,30
119,Sunborn,"Great place to stay very good service prices of food and drinks is good they do extras just ask and book when there we had the massage and afternoon tea it was very nice right near DLR SO YOU can get anywhere 
Bit expensive but good value for what you get 
Loads of food places right there and a few bars 
Go you will enjoy",5,2017,08,30
119,Slightly disappointing ,"We visited as a special occasion and surprise for my husband. Booked direct a long way in advance. Website said we would get an upgrade on arrival. This did not happen. We're promised a drinks voucher but this did not materialise. You had to ask for this. Not the sort of thing I would do. 

My husband was disappointed with the view from the room. I asked for an upgrade which I was willing to pay for but was told this was not possible although I could book online as I was sad enough to check. Bit annoying as I was not asking for it free of charge

We were told where the restaurant was. Upon visiting we were told it was fully booked. Surely reception could have told us that

We asked for the afternoon tea menu and upon choosing we're told it was up in the restaurant and fully booked. Why could someone not have told us this in the first place instead of giving out a menu

On a positive note, food in bar was excellent as was the service

Hotel conveniently located fir O2 which was main purpose of visit. We did not eat breakfast in hotel so I cannot comment. 

Room was very spacious. Lovely comfortable bed, sofa, coffee table, cocktail cabinet, complementary water.

Decent bathroom. Very clean hotel throughout. No noise at night. Staff very polite despite being unable to let us upgrade. I assume they were under management instructions possibly.   Would not stay again personally but nothing wrong with hotel, just eating arrangements ",3,2017,08,30
119,A luxurious novelty,"We stayed on the Sunborn, a dedicated yacht hotel, and found it to be peaceful, spacious and luxurious. The staff on the front desk were very welcoming, helpful and professional as were the breakfast restaurant staff and bar staff. Our in house tablet did not work and the tech team were soon on the job and we were given a complimentary  breakfast for the inconvenience. We could not have found a nicer, more peaceful location so close to the centre. There are numerous travel options, the DLR, Emirates  cable car and river taxis. Our room was large, the bed very comfortable and huge and everything very clean. The shower was wonderful and the coffee machine very welcome. Breakfast was a self service buffet was extensive and staff very helpful in satisfying special requests. The view from the deck bar at night was fantastic. A real gem!",5,2017,08,30
119,Lovely stay,Stayed here in the middle of august staff was very welcoming. Complimentary champagne on arrival. Hotel itself was clean and had a wondurful break would definately reccommend.The hotel takes a card deposit on arrival just incase you order room service or drinks but you also have the option to pay cash and if not dpent refunded on check out.,4,2017,08,30
119,Sadly disappointing - I really wanted to enjoy the expierence,"I was really looking forward to my stay here, however, pretty much straight away there were signs that it may not be all as seen.  The check in process was slow, cold and unhelpful, tbh I found  the receptionist rude.

Walking the corridors to the room , I noticed that everything was looking a little tired and not so clean, the same can be said of the room.  Stained carpet, furnishing worn and dated.

The bathroom looked as if it had a bit of a make over but again the standard was not what I would have expected.

All in all the accommodation just felt a little flat and dated.

We decided to have a drink on the deck to see if this would lift our spirits. This was  accessed through the  the lounge seating area which was also totally uninspiring and look dated.  The deck area had great views of the dock  and the city skyline. 

There were three other couples in total in the deck area and lounge area, so it was extremely quiet and by no means busy.  Having given the waitress ten minutes to come and take our order I gave up and went to the bar , where the waitress was standing next to her till chatting to the barman.  I told the barman what we wanted to which he explained that iit was waitress service only, I chose to ignore this due to the waitress not taking the slightest bit of interest and repeated the order and it was only then that the waitress offered to bring out the drinks.

It was our intention to eat at the restaurant on-board, however, we decided to go and seek sustenance elsewhere as by this time we had enough of the poor service.

When we returned for the night we headed straight to our room/cabin where we bedded down for the night.  We found the room quite noisy, from both other guests walking around on the floor above and the airport.

Would I stay there again - probably not.

As I have previously stated , I really wanted to enjoy the experience but sadly found it lacking in so much.",2,2017,08,29
119,Birthday Treat ,"Absolutely fabulous setting & room, what a birthday surprise. 
A little advice - book a table for dinner when u book as we couldn't get a table on arrival as we was advised to do so had to go out for dinner that was a shame.   To this end we didn't attempt to go for breakfast as we didn't want to get turned away again.   
Robert who checked us out asked if all was okay so I mentioned our mild disappointment and was very concerned and made a lovely gesture in recompense that was not why I mentioned it but if asked I answer truthfully.  
Running a public house I rate the hospitality & service 10/10 and will be definitely returning for a few nights next time.  ",5,2017,08,28
119,Nice hotel ,Spend one night only and it was a very pleasant stay. Lovely bar with great views of London. Rooms big and spacious maybe a little dated but all you need is there. Breakfast was really nice typical hotel breakfast with hot and cold selection. As you walk in the lobby has a wow factor. The afternoon tea was a bit dissapointing but possibly adequate  for the price. Not much atmosphere in the restaurant and the service was slow and unattentive. They were all very friendly just a bit slow. The cakes were nice but sandwiches very average. Not sure why they don't have tables outside. Overall a really nice stay and a good spot to explore the East End. Right next to the cable car!,4,2017,08,28
119,Not particularly luxurious ,The rooms were large and we had a balcony which was good. However the decor was dated and starting to look worn. Lots of stains on the carpet but I understand they are going to be replacing them. The bin in our bathroom hadn't been emptied and to miss something as fundamental as that when cleaning makes me question how clean everything really is. Whilst it was great to have a balcony with chairs the front of the balcony was solid metal so when we sat down you couldn't see the river and didn't really get a view. Would've been better if they had used a clear material that you could see through. Bathroom was quite small. Having been to the Sunborn Gibraltar the London one is a big disappointment. The decor throughout the ship was also dated and the music in the bar was dreadful. Food and service in the restaurant was good and overall the staff were all helpful. It is close to London City Airport so can be very noisy. Overall very disappointing and definitely wouldn't go back. ,3,2017,08,25
119,Great Venue,"Great venue and location, right next to Excel and close to O2.  Cable cars very close to get to O2.  Rooms are lovely. But beware of service charges on everything!  £40 per room per day to pay on checking in, you can ask for this to be removed and pay as you go. Reception looks fantastic and has the WOW factor. Great for a treat and somewhere different.",4,2017,08,25
119,Superb stay,"We stayed one night to celebrate our friends' special birthdays. Everything was perfect, staff very helpful and welcoming. The accommodation spacious, clean and comfortable. Dinner was excellent, steak cooked exactly as we all requested and restaurant staff very attentive. Enjoyed the whole experience and hope to return.",5,2017,08,24
119,Amazing Girlie Getaway,"Just returned from a Groupon one night stay including dinner at the Sunborn with a girlfriend.  We arrived early and was wowed by the beautiful reception area with the sweeping staircase -  as we were early our room wasnt ready but our cases were taken and were shown to the lovely bar area overlooking the thames.  Our room was spacious, clean and modern, dinner was superb, nothing could be faulted, the staff are fantastic, food, atmosphere everything.  Will Definately book again if a deal comes up.",5,2017,08,24
119,Anniversary celebration,"Booked to celebrate our anniversary as it was unusual. It was expensive having booked through Groupon, might have been cheaper booking direct.The yacht looked splendid on the river as we arrived. The reception area was grand and spacious. The reception was welcoming and stored our case until check in time, which was helpful. 
The room was clean and spacious with a view of the river, which was extra. There were tea & coffee making facilities with biscuits being a nice addition. As it was our anniversary they delivered a few handmade chocolates which was a nice touch. We prepaid for a 2course dinner which was delicious and surprisingly plentiful. Apparently they have a new French chef who certainly produced some wonderful food.
The bar in the evening was spacious with wonderful views of the O2 and Emirates.
The staff were helpful and friendly, in particular Jay who gave us the history of the yacht and their aspirations.
Overall a great experience",5,2017,08,23
119,Amazing - we loved it!,"Just returned from our first overnight stay at the Sunborn.  The whole atmosphere is one of luxury, it would be difficult to find anything to criticise.
Cabin overlooking the water was spacious and clean.
Our dinner was perfect, we agreed that the fillet of beef was one of the best we had ever had, and cooked to,perfection.
Breakfast offered a great selection, food was freshly cooked and well presented.
Staff were friendly and helpful.
Definitely recommend the Sunborn.",5,2017,08,23
119,Birthday celebration,"Booked the Sunborn for friends 60th birthdays through Secret Escapes as something different.  From the time we checked in, we only met friendly helpful staff. We went on one of the hottest weekends we have had this year and the air conditioning wasn't working,  As it was a Sunday they couldn't get anyone to fix it.   Carlos in the restaurant  bought a fan to our table while we had our dinner, which was very welcome!!  The food was excellent as was the service. We also received a refund because of the heat. Would highly recommend the Sunborn and Secret Escapes.",5,2017,08,22
119,Great idea but pricey,"Booked to attend the athletics at Stratford.  A plus point should be accessibility, as it's opposite the DLR station, but this is closed until December so there's a 5 minute walk to the next one at the moment.  The area is slightly starkly modern, but safe.  The idea of using a yacht is good, but when you strip it down it's really just a big hotel, as once yet get below decks the corridors and rooms are pretty much standard hotel fare.  Prices in the rooms and the restaurants and bars are pricey by comparison to other places, and we avoided breakfast by eating elsewhere fora third of the price.",3,2017,08,22
119,"Service and standards, have slipped since my last visit","It was our second visit to the Sunborn, a two night stay to celebrate our silver wedding anniversary.

Check in was fine but our room no 5024 had a worrying stain on the carpet, a strong smell of urine in the bathroom and a toilet that didn't flush properly. All of which for the cost of the stay should have been noted and corrected when the room was cleaned and prepared for our arrival.

On our first night we went to the bar at around 11pm for a night cap and I went to the bar to order the drinks while my wife took a seat. I was told to take a seat and that the waiter would be over in a moment to take our order. 
I joined my wife and sat in full view of the bar.
I watched as other people approached the bar and were served at the bar while we waited. It was about fifteen minutes before the barman came to take our order for two glasses of wine and a further 10 minutes to pour them and bring them what must have been nearly 10 metres to our table. (and we where treated to a £2:50 service charge !!)",3,2017,08,21
119,Different and scenic,"Booked in July as a treat for my husband and because I'd always wanted to visit. Thoroughly enjoyed the experience. The yacht is beautifully decorated, the cabins are lovely.spacious and luxurious. The surrounding area has plenty of restaurants and bars to visit and the cable car for the O2 is very near. Would definitely recommend.",5,2017,08,20
119,Something really different!,We were off to the Athletics at the Olympic. Park and it also happened to be my daughter's birthday. Scouted around for hotels in the vicinity and came across Sunborn which struck me as something really different. Booked us in and contacted a lovely lady to see if something could be sorted to mark the occasion. No sooner said than done...a cake balloons and streamers were all ordered with the minimum of fuss! On arrival we couldn't quite believe this was a hotel. Right next door to the Excel Centre it's a great sight. You take a lift up to Reception which is a glorious glitzy affair and the views over the Thames are wonderful. We had an executive room overlooking the river and it was gorgeous. Spacious and airy with a small balcony that took you out to the River. Large King bed and still plenty of room for the sofa bed to be made up (complete with the aforementioned balloons and streamers!) Molton Brown products in the spacious bathroom too. Had a great night with drinks in the lounge followed by a pleasant breakfast the next morning. If you're looking for something that little bit different I would highly recommend this. Thumbs up to all the staff who made our stay that bit extra special.,5,2017,08,20
119,beautiful place,"Booked this as part of the other half's birthday pressie, as had been looking at it for ages.  As a party of 4..  I emailed the reservations team twice to ask about booking a table for the evening, and that im gluten free to see if they could cater for me.No response! .... My friends hubby also called to ask the same and found them very curt on the phone, so i booked a restaurant in London,  Shame cos i really wanted to eat on the yacht and enjoy the views with no worry of transport adding to the cost.. Any how my partner called the day before in case our friend maybe got someone on a bad day... Clearly not as he got the same response with very little help, In fact he said had he booked the night he would have cancelled it!   So we went out to eat.  On arrival, we were blown away, its beautiful, check in was great, friendly and welcoming.  Rooms were huge and very clean.. Bathroom was really big too. Free wifi.. Breakfast on arrival looked amazing, i had fruit whilst the others went for continental, then we all went to the warm breakfast.   All and i mean all were cold. my scrambled egg just came out and was cold, partner had  poached egg cooked to order, also cold. Crazy..  we did complain to the manager, after mine, and then all the other 3's came out cold so complained again, very nicely, pointing out it was all cooked to order it should be piping hot .. He was fab and actually really embarrassed and offered not to charge us for it, Also free drinks in the bar but we declined as it was 9am.lol.  Parking is great, two car-parks within a 4 min walk. and around £15/20 for 24hrs.  Wish we had a 2 night break as the place and staff on board were really nice. Just a shame we were let down in the restaurant, but i would go back.  Was a Thursday night too was didnt seem busy.",4,2017,08,20
119,Lovely yacht,"Massage, champagne, afternoon tea. All very good.
Service....wonderful.
View of the dock, beautiful.
Choice of teas, cakes, scones....lovely.
We had a 45 minute massage which left us both feeling tired but very supple.",5,2017,08,19
119,Pretty perfect,"We stayed here on our date night. We spent out and upgraded to the river view balcony room and were lucky enough to have a fab view from our 5th floor room. 

Reception staff were lovely, we were running late for our dinner off site and they were great in arranging a taxi while we got ready and called us when it was outside. Very polite and happy to help.

We didn't eat on the Sunborn so can't comment on that

The room itself was a good size, didn't feel small at all. The heating worked well, plenty of lights. Very clean on surfaces. Bed was very comfy. Iron and hairdryer in the room which was very welcome and a pleasant surprise. The only negative I have is the bathroom for me was too small and very basic looking. Although that said the shower itself was great. Theres complimentary shower gel and shampoo but no body cream which I thought was odd. 

I liked the location but we spent a lot of time on the underground and DLR. so for that reason I would not stay here again. Also I would have expected a more plush room. Given the price and the 'yacht' itself. The outside and communal areas are very much to that feel but the room/bathroom lets it down. That said, it was a faultless stay and very comfortable ",5,2017,08,19
119,Unique experience - once on board you'll never want to leave,"A truly unique experience from moment you board. 

Reception is as grand as any 5-star hotel with chandelier and amazing staircase. Our cabin riverside was bigger than expected and boasted all the usual from coffee/tea to iron boards, satellitte TV etc but its mostly irrelevant as we spent as little time as possible there.

Make sure to eat in the spectacular Lands-End Restuarant on the fourth deck - book in advance as it can be very busy and ask for a window table viewing over the Emirates Airline, Canary Wharf and all the way up the Shard (Europes Tallest Building)....Service is best 5 star we experienced and food to match! 

Afterwards we retired to the lounge where an amazing Saxophone Player kept the crowd fully engaged and entertained well past midnight...

Pricewise - not expensive as you might think, Lands-End compares well with any top class restuarant while cocktails afterwards were a little pricey (about 13 pound mark) but also very strong! 

Overall we loved it....some small quibbles, check in and check out was slow a computer problem did not appear to have been dealt with in the 24 hours we were there. Also in the bar a 30 minute wait for one round of drinks was for us way too slow and not the standard of service we had at other times on board...

TIP - if travelling to Airports, Airline Mini-cabs just two minutes walk from Sun Born offer great deals...Stanstead £50 for us.....",4,2017,08,19
119,A WEEK AT THE SUNBORN,"Stayed here for the week during the World Athletics. Had a fab stay room over looking the Thames with a balcony, large room for London. Great views from breakfast room and bar/ dining area. Breakfast was very good even when it`s busy. House keeping do a great job. Stayed here before and would certainly stay again.",5,2017,08,17
119,Birthday surprise,What a lovely present went there for two nights with my partner . It was out of this world .cabins were luxurious  everything you need .good food  .everything spotless .it's a place to just sit and relax and feel like a film star .recommend 100%.,5,2017,08,17
119,Much Improved,"We wrote a less than glowing report following our stay in October 2016 but having been assured of improvements we booked another stay at the Sunborn.  

The room sizes are better than most charging significantly more in London and the views from the riverside rooms and the decks are fantastic.

Definitely worth staying, even if you are spending time in the City or West-End as the DLR is a short walk and there are a few decent bars and restaurants across the square from the hotel.

Credit to Maryiam and her team for delivering excellent service during our latest stay. We've already booked another night at this splendid hotel.",5,2017,08,17
119,London City break,"Used Sunborn as a base during London weekend with friends., Lovely rooms, cocktail bar and deck etc. Niche but nice!! 
Breakfast buffet ok but could be more in line with hotel. 
Easily accessible by DLR
All in all reasonable option on a very busy athletics weekend due to World Championships",4,2017,08,16
119,Excellent base for our visit to the London Stadium,"We stayed in a lovely river-facing room for a weekend whilst visiting the London Stadium to watch the Athletics World Championship.  We loved it, much more than the Gibraltar sister ship we had stayed at in March.  Beautiful spacious room (spotlessly clean), nice balcony with chairs, good breakfasts (£7.50 full English before 9 am during our weekend), spectacular views of Royal Victoria Dock.  Will stay again.  The only thing I didn't like, being extremely claustrophobic, is that you have to enter and exit via a lift (no other way in or out).  I usually avoid lifts like the plague, but at least these ones are glass and the journey short.",5,2017,08,16
119,Sight Seeing and Athletics,"This is by far our favourite hotel in London.  It's location is ideal being close to the Excel Centre, the DLR and the Emirates Airline Cable Car for quick and easy access to Greenwich.  Our room was spacious, comfortable, spotless and had an interesting river view.  The public areas are spacious and comfortable and the restaurant is quite exceptional.  The food was of fine dining standard and the views looking toward Canary Wharf and the City are spectacular, as is the view from the bar.

The service was of a very high standard and it is difficult to find anything to criticise. 
We will definitely be visiting again as soon as we can.  Thank you everybody.",5,2017,08,16
119,A great place to stay,We had booked the hotel for its location as near to Olympic park.  Hotel looks amazing as you approach it floating on the dock.  We arrived early but we were able to check in straight away.  Our room was amazing - beautiful polished wood befitting an old luxury yacht and a very spacious room too overlooking the dock. You can sit on deck for drinks or just inside behind the floor to ceiling windows.  Lovely staff - attentive and friendly.  Didn't have chance to eat there but will certainly be back.  Great place for something a little different and excellent location for the O2 as well.,4,2017,08,15
119,So nice,"Just stayed 1 night at The Sunborn and WOW, what an experience. From checking in to leaving we had such an incredible stay. Reception staff are so helpful (thanks Robert) the room was beautifully clean and dinner..........
best Fillet Steak ever & Dominik was a perfect host.

Stayed on the dockside of the yacht which is great if you enjoy people watching while enjoying a glass of Champagne. Plenty of bars close by if you want to go out & only 20 minutes to the center of London by private hire taxi which costs approximately £12 to £20 depending on which company you use. Looking forward to returning at some point in the not too distant future.",5,2017,08,15
119,Excellent Hotel And Good Location For Excel and O2,Stayed 2 nights whilst attending the World Athletics Championships. Excellent room with fridge and coffee machine and large comfy beds. Complementary bottles of water and Molton Brown toiletries daily. Helpful friendly staff. Breakfast of good standard but quite expensive at £19-50 per person. ,5,2017,08,15
119,Sunborn Yacht Hotel,"We had a fabulous overnight stay in this lovely yacht hotel. All the fun of a cruise with no seasickness. Large room with balcony, a bottle of prosecco in the room and a delicious breakfast. Loved it! ",5,2017,08,15
119,Fabulous Weekend,"Just a short note of thanks for the service and attitude of your staff on the Sunborn, they are a credit to ISS! My party was of 6 and nothing was too much trouble, from Sandra on the front desk, Maryiam looking after us on arrival and the restaurant staff ensuring we had a large table at each breakfast sitting. A very Special mention though for the personal attention of Romao for the whole weekend, who was an absolute GEM, making us feel most welcome and at home. This was a very special weekend of birthdays and Anniversaries, so to have our stay be so great, made it all the more enjoyable for ourselves. Please pass on our sincere thanks to your team, they were magnificent!",5,2017,08,15
119,Champagne at sunset!,"Ever since I first read about Sunborn, I have wanted to stay! I was not disappointed! All the staff, particularly Sandra at Reception were very friendly and helpful - Looking out at the sunset with all the lights of London appearing was magical with my complimentary champagne - even if I was on my own! .",5,2017,08,14
119,Ok but missing no the wow,"On first impression it was wow, but when closer the outside of the yacht was incredibly dirty, for the prices they charge I would've thought the first impressions were all important, the checking in process was painful, waited far to long considering the rooms are paid for up front, the first room were we given was very noisy, it had a constant pump sound, the receptionist was very good and changed are room quickly and with no fuss, the rooms are very spacious and well equipped, I would have preferred fresh milk as opposed to uht jiggers at this level though for the tea and coffee facilities, the bed was very comfortable and clean as was the bathroom, we had a lovely river view that was spoilt some what by the very dirty windows. We ate out the first night, so on to breakfast, it was the typical help yourself buffet breakfast, no offer to have made to order things such as porridge, kippers or eggs Benedict, again I would've thought at this level it would've been standard. So on to the restaurant in the evening, we opted for their fish taster menu, as it was a special occasion, the dishes all looked fantastic although the execution wasn't so good, the first plate the fish cakes were over cooked and not particularly crispy, almost like they had been reheated, the John Dory was very overcooked and the prawn and salmon mousse in the lemon sole was gritty, so with 3 dishes out of the 6 substandard it made the £75pp price tag a little harder to stomach, but that said the service was second to none, very attentive waiter, fabulous table with a fantastic view of London and the river. We checked out on the Sunday morning having been woken up at 8.30 by housekeeping slamming doors constantly for best part of an hour despite our complaint to reception, for which we were reimbursed as unacceptable on a Sunday when away trying to relax, all in all I would recommend the Sunborn for a unique experience however I don't think it would be one we would repeat. ",3,2017,08,14
119,Beautiful experience,"Visited here as a treat and for another night added on to our original stay in London.

We arrived before check-in time, but were able to get rid of our luggage (which was put into our room before we got there) and were able to use the facilities, and as our ""offer"" included a large bottle of Fiz we sat and drank that overlooking the Thames and the 02 Arena.

Our cabin was amazing with a balcony overlooking the River and all the luxury items you could want on a Yacht Hotel, including fluffy dressing gowns, the largest, softest and heaviest of bath towels I have ever used before.  The cabin was massive with a lounge area, fridge, large flat screen television and tea and coffee facilities.

We dined in the Restaurant (bit expensive, but worth it) the meals were absolutely beautiful, and presented in such a grand manner they looked too nice to eat!! 

Breakfast the next morning was also amazing with such a wide variety of items to choose from.   

Staff were all really helpful, smart and efficient - the stay was worth every penny it cost us.",5,2017,08,14
119,A different experience,"Stayed here as it was quite easy to get to the Olympic stadium to see the athletics.The river view room was lovely as it should be for the price.We had 3 nights here.Our first breakfast was £19.50 each which was far too pricey.Luckily there was a deal the next 2 days of £7.50 each if you ate before 9am.The breakfast service was rather shambolic as they ran out of juice,plates and pastries and we had a long wait while they replenished them.Not enough staff.",4,2017,08,14
119,Disappointing - It flatters to deceive.,"I booked this hotel as a surprise for my husband, it looked pure luxury but was in fact very disappointing. Upon check in at 4pm we were told that our dinner reservation was for 5.30pm, which was too early for us to eat. We were give alternatives of 7pm or 9.30pm both not really suitable. Bar area was tired staff slow and wine list was very poor for what I thought was a luxury hotel.",3,2017,08,14
119,Birthday and Anniversary,"It was my wife's birthday on the 11th and our 39th Wedding Anniversary on the 12th.  We went on our annual jaunt to London and incorporate a show.

This year we decided to spend the weekend on the Sunborn Yach Hotel, which is harboured at the Western Gateway, Royal Victoria Dock , London, E16 1AA.

What an experience and what a Yacht.  The staff were absolutely fantastic and went out of their way to help.  Nothing was an issue.  Due to the fact that it was my wife's birthday and our Anniversary we were given vouchers for free champagne, which was totally unexpected.

This Yacht is whole heartidly reccommebded and i have no hesitation in recommending this hotel.

Had a fantastic weekend.

We will be looking at booking the Yacht again for next year.",5,2017,08,13
119,Watch your credit/bank statement they take more that they should,"Enjoyed the hotel and the food for diner was first class.  Breakfast a bit of a let down as it was buffet style and very disappointed that the fruit salad came from a TIN!!
Accommodation was good and the overall look of the yacht was good.
They have taken two payments from my credit card and I am having a lot of trouble sorting it out.  They are now not responding to my emails
NOT A HOTEL FOR YOU IF YOU ARE DOING LONDON AS IT IS QUITE A WAY OUT.",3,2017,08,12
119,Under the sea,"I booked a deal through Wowcher  for the under the sea afternoon tea with champagne followed by a full body massage 

 Usually I swim around this yatch  in various open water swims and was nice to actually step on board and wow it blew me away 

 First we had our afternoon tea with the usual sandwiches and cakes and these are little piece of heaven followed with a glass of champagne delicious 

Great view on a sunny day and you could watch the world go by in the water of people paddleboarding and jet skiers and the like.  For tea I'd recommend the blueberry 

 After two hours also eating and drinking ourselves the way we went for a 45 minute full body massage and well let's put it this way it was the best for body massage I've ever had and I can't wait to go back for more I even fell asleep that's how relaxed I was",5,2017,08,12
119,Perfect,"Having spent 2 weekends on board in recent months and going back on visits for lunch and drinks on the boat when visiting the area, I can honestly say it is a perfect yacht in a perfect setting with perfect facilities among perfect staff, we love the sunborn.",5,2017,08,12
119,Nice rooms lovely yacht ,We were upgraded free to a room with a little balcony which was lovely . Just a shame the carpets were so stained . And a real shame there was a wedding party shouting about in the bar . One 'lady' had got hold of the Mike and was swearing .  We didn't stop around not my sort of idea of entertainment... I thought it would have been a better class of people to be honest ... so was left feeling a little disappointed ,4,2017,08,11
119,Float away in comfort ,"Had the pleasure of staying here for three nights. Lovely large and well appointed room, friendly and attentive staff made for a very enjoyable experience. If you are looking for a hotel with a twist what could be better than a yacht in London! Lovely view from the deck in the evening.",5,2017,08,11
119,Fantastic surprise birthday treat in London,"Defiantly has a wow factor, great service by helpful staff, nothing was too much trouble.
Fantastic room with balcony overlooking the dock.  Very peaceful, planes do fly over the dock for London Dockland Airport, very low and very loud but only late afternoon and late morning (after 0900).  The rooms were well sound proofed so the aircraft were not a problem.
Excellent restaurant with great food at a good price for the quality.
Sundowner in the deck bar made the evening compete.
Emirates cable car adjacent and then a rivers into the centre of London mad day two a treat. 
Very hard to find any criticism of the hotel.
Not sure I should write this because it will be difficult to book in next time - There will defiantly be a next time for us",5,2017,08,11
119,Utterly Unusual and Brilliant,"The Sunborn London completely exceeded our expectations. It was beautiful, especially the foyer upon arrival. The rooms did not disappoint, they were roomy and very comfortable. The staff were amazing and curteous. We thoroughly enjoyed our stay and will be returning.",5,2017,08,11
119,Birthday treat for a friend ,"Stayed here to celebrate a friends birthday. The yacht itself was lovely, however rooms are quite basic considering the price. 
We dined on the yacht and the food was amazing, all in all a nice little treat but not something I'd do again ",4,2017,08,10
119,Let down by the lounge service,"I will cover the good points before moving on to the reason for the low scoring. The ensuite I found okay. Not the best shower but still good. My favourite shower accessories and what I use at home - Molten  Brown. The room itself is very nice and a good size with a good sized balcony. Everything very spotless. The inroom tablet was a nice idea but I had my own. There was a small fridge which was handy. The bed was very comfortable. However, the balcony door was very difficult to open and needed quite a push. Being close to the airport meant it was quite noisy even with the doors closed. Dinner was amazing. Slightly slow service but served with flare by very professional staff and with the view we had of the cable car and Canary Wharf straight ahead of us, we didn't care. The food was very good and very well presented.
Now the minus. One of the most important things in my opinion, and which sets the mood,  is check in. There was a bit of a queue. After the receptionist had taken my details he spent a bit of time going through the computer before excusing himself and going into a back room. A bad sign unless they are about to offer you a suite.  After about 10 minutes I was told the room was not quite ready, it would be another 5 minutes or so. This inspite of us arriving at check in time of 3.00, not earlier. It was suggested we waited in the lounge and we were given a voucher for 2  glasses of champagne. The lounge is the most disappointing feature with no character. We managed to find one small table with 2 chairs near the door leading to the deck - it was the only spare table - where the children of parents who did not care how they behaved kept going in and out. Every time, they let the door close with a bang. My husband handed in the voucher at the bar and was told it was table service. It took 20 minutes to get our drinks. Although the receptionist said we had a choice of drinks, we were not offered a choice. Just as well we both drink champagne. The waitress at one point came over and sort of apologised for the delay, but it did not seem to come easily to her and the reason trailed away, as if she were doing something she had to but did not want to. When we had nearly finished our drinks, she obviously remembered the nuts which she plonked on the table. Worse still, the people ahead of us only got them after they had finished their drinks. I would have thought a 4 star establishment would seek you out and let you know when the room was ready. In fact wit the long delay getting our drinks they ""bought"" themselves half an hour. I have to add, the evening service was better.
And finally, note, all the very good comments, and the bad, but not once has there been any management comment, unlike other places. Here, they obviously don't care.",3,2017,08,10
119,Anniversary Trip,"We stayed here for our first wedding anniversary at the start of June. We booked a package for bed and breakfast and a 2 course meal. We upgraded our room on arrival to a river view which I would recommend doing.
The rooms were traditional but clean and tidy, and surprisingly spacious.
The food at dinner was fantastic and the service was brilliant, we couldn't fault it. Breakfast was also good, fresh food and plenty of choice.
The only negative thing I can say about this hotel is its location, it's quite far out from the center of London but the network links are really good. That said, the location is perfect for the O2 Arena.
Overall I'd definitely recommend this hotel but shop around for a deal.",5,2017,08,09
119,Treat Yourself,"For us this was to be a couple of days in London with friends staying overnight on the yacht, just as a treat for us all. Unfortunately for us the weather was dreadful which meant we didn't leave the hotel at all. 
The staff were very friendly and helpful on arrival, immediately taking our bags to our rooms so we could adjourn to the bar to wait for the rain to stop!  After a couple of hours watching the rain on the deck we decided to have our lunch. My husband says his burger was the best he's ever tasted and the sandwiches were huge.  The price of each of these was about £14 each, so not cheap.  Be careful when ordering spirits at the bar. You are automatically given , and charged for, a double  so our G&Ts were £10 each. The beer was also £10  For a pint.
Our rooms were wonderful, with views of the Thames, admittedly a very grey Thames. The most comfortable bed with really good pillows, big wardrobe, safe, hairdryer,  lovely shower, a wall of mirrors, comfy sofa. We wanted for nothing.
We had pre booked our table for dinner. The food was all over tasty but the portions were maybe small for the men. 
All in all a very opulent hotel, all glass and shiny brass - beautiful. The only thing that spoilt it was our awful English weather.",5,2017,08,09
119,Birthday Celebration,Stayed here for one night with a group of friends to celebrate my 50th birthday. Expensive for one night but thought it was different and something to remember.  Hotel never acknowledged my birthday but my friends bought cakes and balloons.  We enjoyed our night out at the bars in the O2 and ride on the cable car.  Overall a good time was had but hotel overpriced.,3,2017,08,09
119,Wonderful,"Lucky enough to stay in the best room on board. Absolutely perfect weekend.
Could not fault the accommodation or the service given to us by the staff.
Particularly enjoyed our own private sauna and jacuzzi. Bed very comfortable. 
Fantastic views. Food excellent.",5,2017,08,07
119,Amazing experience,"Lovely room with balcony, the rooms are large and very comfortable. The rooms has all the amenities required with a touch of luxury. Could imagine being on a luxury yacht! Excellent location.  The staff were very helpful and friendly.",4,2017,08,06
119,A comfortable 1 night stay ,"We stayed here for 1 night whilst visiting London for a birthday. Had the executive room with balcony which is a good size and comes with coffee and tea making facilities and a fridge. 

Service was good but not outstanding as you would expect on a yacht like this however I would recommend it. ",4,2017,08,06
119,Try it for yoursef ....... and see ...,"Had a one-night Groupon deal for two people with dinner, bed, breakfast.  Excellent deal.  Ship is beautiful if somewhat ""tired"", but nevertheless a great experience.  No real facilities on board but accommodation great, dinner excellent, staff and service first class.

Location superb and perfect for the 02 Arena, especially if your timings permit crossing the river by cable car when you can be dropped almost at the front door of the area.  (Need to check return times tho!!!)

Will definitely go again but with lower expectations in terms of ""hotel facilities"", but for DB&B cannot be faulted.

Recommended.",5,2017,08,06
119,Surly service ,"Requested a high room - but were dismissed with  the lowest floor on the basis that 'it is only a request' 

A lot of money for being at water level. 

Don't expect to be greeted at the restaurant if you arrive at 2.50pm - they close  at 3pm - we were told in no uncertain terms! 

The bar staff have no idea as to whether food can be served on the deck - which is the point of booking a boat on the Thames.  ",2,2017,08,06
119,Planning on returning!,"Bought a Groupon deal for this hotel. Somehow the date I thought I'd 'booked' via Groupon didn't work (an issue with Groupon, not the hotel), so I frantically phoned the hotel the night before I intended to stay, and they kindly honoured my Groupon despite it being past the booking date, despite my original attempt at booking having failed, and despite the terms on Groupon that the hotel was obliged to do nothing. So, phew; I was able to stay here for my birthday. 

The entrance and reception area has a beautiful staircase. The staff were efficient and friendly enough (although they did miss out some important information like breakfast time and check out time). 

Our Executive Suite was lovely, gorgeously decorated and very spacious, with our own balcony. The only downside is that I'd have liked a river view, not a dockside view (but due to our booking being last minute, this was not possible). 

The free prosecco that we had with the deal was very nice! Breakfast was also very nice, with particularly nice hashbrowns, and the breakfast room was lovely. The bar was also lovely in the evening. 

If you get motion sickness, you don't need to worry as you wouldn't know you were on a boat if it weren't for the water around you!

I would definitely return and I intend to do so! I would like to try the spa!",5,2017,08,05
119,Short break - husbands birthday ,"Booked 2 nights for a surprise for my husbands birthday - upgraded to a balcony room as wanted something a bit special. 

Overall it's s lovely hotel , room was spacious, was slightly put off by the badly stained carpet in our room. 

Bar lounge area had fantastic views, service by bar staff and breakfast staff was excellent. Drinks pricey but we were well aware of that and we didn't actually eat in the restaurant and found other places in the vicinity. 

Breakfast very tasty, more bread choice would be good. 

Found it a good base to explore - transport network very efficient. ",4,2017,08,05
119,Mini break ,"I stayed here with my wife for a two night mini break. We originally booked this hotel as the reviews were really good and it looked like it would be a special place to stay at a realistic price. 
The location of the boat is ok however it is quite far out from the centre of the city so it can take a while to get places obviously depending on where you want to go. It is close to the dlr about a five minute walk. It is also really well placed to the o2 and we did get the cable cars across to there one day. There are a few nice bats and restaurants in the immediate area if you are not wanting to eat at the hotel but stay local. 
When we arrived at the hotel we were greeted by a welcoming receptionist who allowed us to park the car outside to bring our luggage in. We were then directed to the royal Victoria car park which is a couple of minutes walk away and is reasonably priced for London parking at £15 for 24 hours flat rate. 
The entrance and the reception area at the hotel look quite impressive. The whole hotel was clean and we could tell the house keepers worked hard and did their jobs well. 
The room we stayed in had a river view with a small balcony. The view was nice and the balcony was small but good. The only problem was it had rained whilst there so it did get quite a large puddle in the doorway and there was no where for this water to drain away to. The room was clean and had everything we needed to stay and be comfortable. The bed was large and particularly comfortable. There was nothing to complain about however there was nothing to shout about either and we wouldn't say it was 'luxurious' 
We went to the bar area one night for a drink however we left without having a drink as there was no where to sit and although we would have liked to have sat outside they were not serving outside due to wind. We can't comment on the breakfast as we felt it was overpriced and so ate elsewhere. 
Overall we had a comfortable stay and it was clean with all the facilities you could need. The staff are welcoming and friendly and ready to help. It just lacked the wow factor we thought it would have. We are pleased we stayed for the novelty factor and would recommend it if you need a comfortable well priced hotel in that area of London. ",4,2017,08,04
119,The Good & The Not Very Good!!,"The location, the scenery, the setting is indeed wonderful. The room very large, decent enough, though, the tiny window looking on to the river, was too small and dirty, the bed has this thin mattress on the top of the main mattress, bit flimsy if I may say, the sink, chipped and maybe cracked, but generally the room was ok. 
The food was fiercely expensive and pretty tasteless, I paid for a lousy dry scrambled egg and some smoked salmon on the top, more than £22.00 in room service, see pic.
You cannot get to the entrance of the hotel by car, that means, a, you need to drag all your stuff a few minutes walk, from the last point where a car can drive, b, on top of that, you have to pay steep parking fees.
The worst part is the reception, the never ending queue, I was there two nights, every time I passed the reception, there was a long line of people, waiting to check in or out, really understaffed. I also tried calling one morning to the reception//customer relations/concierge and front desk, no one answered, anything besides room service, no one would pick up, I tried in various intervals, for nearly 2 hours. I then asked in room service, how come no one besides yourselves are picking up the phones, I was told, they are busy with lots of check ins etc. 

All in all, it's a nice enough experience, if you want to enjoy the cable car ride over the Thames, the 02 center or Excel, or if you fancy a romantic night on a yacht hotel, but, they sure need to up their game seriously.",3,2017,08,03
119,Engagement,"My fiancé (boyfriend) at the time was surprising me to a night away in London and I had no idea where we was staying, but the second we got there and my eyes fell on the yacht I was in love! 
I loved everything about it and I truly didn't want to leave! 
The night we stayed was also the night my boyfriend got on one knee and proposed to me! The lady at reception took photos of the whole thing so I now have the memory forever! They treated us to a glass of free champagne to congratulate us and treated us like royalty. It was honestly the best night of my life and it was made even better being at the most beautiful hotel! 
The whole experience; the room, staff, reception was just amazing and breathtaking. I honestly cannot rant about it enough. I get tears just looking at these amazing pictures. It truly was the best night of my life and I will never forget it or forget how nice everyone was to us. 
I can't thank the staff any more, they were amazing and made my night so magical. I can't wait to go back again.
Thank you Sunborn for my magical night, I will never forget it! And to the lady on the front desk, thank you for the pictures they are amazing! 
I can't get over how amazing the place and staff are. 
If you are looking for a romantic, perfect, beautiful hotel to get away then this is the place for you! ",5,2017,08,03
119,It would have been 5* rating !!,"My boyfriend booked this for 3 nights for my 50th birthday. We stayed the night of my birthday and my boyfriend rang 10 days before going to book some surprises for me. He was assured that the balloons, banners, cake and flowers would be there as I walked in the room. The disappointment on his face when we walked into an Pundecorated room was pained to say the least. He told me, wait here don't unpack we might be in the wrong room. He went to reception explained the situation to be told "" oh it was the new girl that took the order, we can see it's been written down, we'll look into it"". Nothing was done until we mentioned it as we checked out 3 days later. Two balloons and two cup cakes were given to us. This was very nice and a lovely gesture but a bit of a disappointment to the surprise that was planned. The hotel itself even though we never ate there was lovely and clean. Would I want another big birthday there? Not if that's how they handle them.",3,2017,08,02
119,Overnight Stay,"Took my girlfriend for a surprise overnight stay, made very welcome and room was and bed were huge. Had a river view, which gave us great views and was very quiet. Not the easiest hotel to get to, had to get three trains but it's definitely worth the hassle.

Didn't go to the restaurant, but the bar service was very good and made a great finish to our evening after eating out in the west end.

Room wasn't the cleanest, had a couple of dirty marks on the carpet, also the free bottles of water in the minibar were already half drunk!! not what you expect from a 4/5 star hotel in london.

Having said that we had a great night, and would go back again..",4,2017,08,02
119,night afloat,"We had a great nights stay at the Yacht Hotel. The staff are friendly  and helpful.The room was nice and big, would have liked to have stayed longer as we were late getting back so we couldn't enjoy all the facility's that the Yacht had to offer. The DRL station is only a 5 or 10 min walk away. Its away from the center but that can be a good point.We would recommend this Hotel .",5,2017,07,31
119,Something different / amazing food!,"Stayed here as part of a party of 5 over the weekend. Really enjoyed staying somewhere different and so close to the O2 thanks to the cable cars. 

Really relaxing atmosphere. We had a three course lunch as part of the early bird menu, and were SO impressed with the quality of the food for the price. Table service fantastic. All staff were so friendly throughout entire stay. 

Breakfast also really nice. Spot on. Would definitely recommend to others. ",5,2017,07,31
119,London birthday trip,"We had a lovely room with a river view huge bed nice bathroom with Molton Brown toiletries and nice proper bath towels all these little things make a difference you know 
The main reception is very plush check in was good nice staff we had breakfast on the first morning was fine what you would expect from a hotel 
We did use the bar cocktails were nice bit expensive but we did get a 25%off voucher for one drink each which came in a hand delivered and hand written letter wishing me a happy birthday nice touch I thought yes would love to stay again it is a bit far out but transport links are good we did get a taxis back from the west end one night and this was £30 so not too bad",4,2017,07,29
119,Great weekend hideout,"Had an amazing one night stay at this wonderful hotel. I was greeted with a warm friendly smile by the staff at the reception. Very welcoming. I was excited upon entering the room. Though I requested for a room facing the river but it was  fully booked. Nevertheless, I had a nice room that is facing the dock and my view was Excel hall but it was still a nice view with a balcony. Great service, Great view and i extremely enjoy my weekend. The breakfast was only £7.50 per person and not bad actually. I would like to try the executive suite next time. ",5,2017,07,29
119,Beautiful Yayct hotel,"Enjoyed a 2 night break with the family at Sunborn Yacht Hotel. The rooms are spacious and the beds extremely comfortable.
A generous selection of Molton Brown toiletries.
We enjoyed a superb meal at Lands End Restaurant where the service was very good indeed. We celebrated a belated birthday and staff were kind enough to provide a slice of cake and a candle for the birthday girl.
Loved everything about our stay and look forward to visiting again  ",5,2017,07,28
119,Unable to amend booking,"What a shame the hotel were unable to make any changes to my booking when a member of my party was taken suddenly sick. Other hotels in the past have been far more accommodating when adverse circumstances have struck. 

The rooms are large, well decorated and well equipped but very noisy; the engine causes the walls / windows to vibrate. This made sleep problematic.

Prices in the very dull bar are the same as in nicer London venues.",1,2017,07,28
119,Anniversary ,"Run down and grubby. Waiting 20mins as there was only one woman behind reception . Executive suit with upgrade to river view , toilet cracked.  Tiles and sink chipped and run down. Carpets dirty and app old and stretched have rolls in them . Paid £250 for a night . Would rather have stayed in better 2 star hotels .Food was fair",2,2017,07,27
119,"Surprise treat,  luxury yacht   in Docklands, sorry disappointing","I thought as a novelty it was worth a try and the web site really does tempt a traveller to think that your getting five star luxury, sorry no where near it. You shouldn't have to join a queue for breakfast and listen to the complaints  ""no coffee yet  but I finished breakfast ages ago"".  The drinks were overpriced, the i pad in the room didn't work and on mentioning this no apology or reaction the internet is not user friendly and like others who mention this I gave up trying to connect.  The staff no nothing about the local area and London in general  furthermore they lacked enthusiam",3,2017,07,27
119,Mirrors on the Thames....,"Its a novel idea. Buy a large luxury yacht, sail it to London and permanently moor it in a buzzy part of town. I chose this hotel as it was really close to London City Airport and I was traveling from there but needed an overnight close by. It looked like a great option, got great reviews and the idea of staying on a boat was quite attractive.

The first problem I encountered was finding it in an Uber. The GPS kept taking us to the wrong location which was frustrating for the driver and me. Eventually we figured out that you cannot actually get near to the boat at all as it's in an area that traffic is not allowed. Not that big a deal for me as I had a back pack and a small roller but if I had my family and a bunch of bags it would have been a major pain in the neck. 

The boat is pretty impressive in a glitzy over the top super gold plated way! There's gold everywhere! And Mirrors.... lots of them but it works and feels really quite plush if a little dated. Check in was easy and the reception staff very pleasant.

My room was actually pretty spacious, the bed was comfortable and although the bathroom was really small it was functional. The most off putting thing for me about the room was the amount of mirrors. I understand they are probably there to created the illusion of space and that a giant mirror opposite the bed might be a good thing for a romantic evening with your partner but for me it was a real turn off and totally unnecessary. 

There is free internet on the boat but that might as well not even be there. I have not had internet that slow since the AOL dial up days. I gave up in the end and used my phone as a hot spot as that was a lot quicker. 

As I was walking up to the boat to check in a plane roared overhead taking off from London City airport and my heart dropped but I have to say there wasn't one time that planes or other peripheral noise kept me awake and I was very impressed with that.

There are some restaurants in the locale, I ate at a Tapas bar just across from the boat which was pretty good. There's a Starbucks right there too. I did not order room service or eat on the boat so I have no opinion or feedback regarding those things. The bar on the boat was pretty busy and seemed chilled but again I did not spend anytime there.

Getting to London City airport was quick but kind of annoying as I had to drag my bag and myself down the street so I could grab an Uber. I'm just glad it wasn't raining as that would be a a very unpleasant experience.

I do wish I could have given this a 3.5 start rating for good as Sunborn is good, just not very good. I do not think I would stay there again but I would not discourage anyone from checking it out, it is truly a unique experience.",3,2017,07,26
119,Perfect for a birthday treat,"Spoilt my husband with a weekend in London and stayed here. Lovely hotel and fun to stay on a yacht. Friendly staff. Nice bar. Great location for excel and the O2.   

Room was lovely with great view over dock - woke up to seeing the swimming leg of the London Tri!",5,2017,07,26
119,Birthday surprise for husband !!,"I searched this boat on booking .com it looked first class !! 

When we arrived it looked pretty impressive check in was straight forward . I managed to upgrade our room to a balcony I really recommend you have a room with a balcony or it might feel a little claustrophobic!! 

We arranged dinner in the lands end upper deck for a 6 course tasting menu . 
The food was lovely very well presented and colourful , it was a shame the waiter did not have a clue what we had been served !! 
The restaurant is lacking in atmosphere some what and waiter service needs to be more polished and prompt .
 As a well travelled individual I have dined in the most beautiful restaurants in the world and feel they need to up there game in here . 

The rooms were spacious and clean very nautical , lots of dark highly polished wood and white walls . The ensuites are quite compact and a little dated but nevertheless did what was required. 

The drinks are very expensive and service quite slow , they need to be sharper in ordering drinks and be more vigilant to customers waiting for service . 

All in all tried , tested but something you would only do the once .",3,2017,07,26
119,Outstanding value for such quality accommodation.,"Stayed at Sunborn on Sun 23 July. Room was very large with super king bed plus spacious lounge area, very well appointed as was the rest of the hotel. Breakfast was very good with a wide range of hot and cold options.

Impressive views across the Royal Victoria dock, particularly at night time.

Service was excellent throughout, from Reception to bar staff to dining room staff",5,2017,07,25
119,70th birthday,"A gorgeous yacht, lovely food, great accommodation, friendly, worth a visit for a special occasion it's good to do something different and reasonably priced a good selection of wines & champagne also fantastic starters just perfect from the restaurant to take photo's with Canary Wharf in the background makes it that little bit special ",5,2017,07,24
119,Fab weekend at the Sunborn Yacht,"Can't recommend the Yacht enough. Fab food, rooms spacious and beautiful. Service great, staff were great nothing too much trouble. Treat yourself it's worth it. Quiet location near the O2 and Excel. For me as a foodie it was top notch and couldn't fault breakfast either.",5,2017,07,24
119,Birthday celebrations,"Unique hotel, great location, fantastic staff. Six ladies of a certain age celebrating a big birthday had a wonderful time on board Sunborn.  The reception staff were excellent, polite and helpful, particularly Andrea. We were able to leave our luggage early before we had been allocated rooms and then after checkout the next day.  Our rooms were river view, clean and very well equipped. Slight problem with the air con in room 2006 which we didn't report at the time. Beautiful chocolates and welcome letter on arrival in each of our rooms.  The restaurant staff were very efficient and ensured our gluten intolerant birthday girl was catered for even to the extent of a piece of gluten free cake with a candle!  Evening menu was of excellent quality and beautifully presented. All tastes catered for at breakfast and supplies constantly refilled.  Andreas Stys, General Manager, introduced himself after offering to take photos for us on the deck and spent some time telling us about the yacht's history.  Lancy(?) restaurant manager, had spoken to me on the phone several times prior to our visit and recognised my name when we arrived for breakfast. Lovely lady! Thank you to everyone who made it a special and memorable weekend for all of us but especially for our birthday girl!",5,2017,07,24
119,An enjoyable novelty ,"Stayed here for one night in a deluxe river view room. Good service by all the staff and room was of a good size which was a surprise given it's a yacht. 
Food was ok but only had something from the bar menu
Would recommend you try for something a bit different. Would return. ",4,2017,07,24
119,"Lovely hotel, not so lovely service","I recently stayed at The Sunborn London with my wife for our wedding anniversary and although it is a lovely place in a great location,  it was let down in some areas which ultimately had a negative impact on our stay.

The door in our room which led onto our balcony was very stiff to open, and at first I thought it was broken, however after around 5 minutes of persevering I was finally able to open it to get out side and enjoy the view.

Breakfast - We were seated at our table and asked if we would like Tea or Coffee, we opted for coffee and then got our breakfast and sat down to enjoy it. After 15 minutes our coffee still had not arrived, my wife asked the lady who seated us where it was, only to be met with the reply 'we're busy',  once our pot of coffee arrived it was placed on our table without any form of apology for us not be able to have it with our breakfast, the member of staff that served us and to whom the question was asked to could've been a little more polite and should work on her people skills.
Other issues with the breakfast were that the bacon was undercooked, the scrambled egg was bland and the fried eggs were hard, ultimately for such an elegant place the food at breakfast is sub standard, and is not what you expect when paying the prices which they ask for when booking Bed and Breakfast.

There were also no side plates put  out for toast or pastries to be placed on.

The room was nice but definitely overpriced, we paid £199 for a one night stay which I considered a great deal considering our room should've been £349!!. However once there and in the room, you do not feel like you are staying in a room that's worth £100 per night let alone £349.

Overall its a great looking hotel inside and out but is let down by some members of staff, its pricing and the poor service at breakfast.",2,2017,07,24
119,Romantic Weekend,"The Sunborn was a total surprise to my partner, it's a magnificent Superyacht, built as a Hotel..!! Rooms are large and very well fitted out, facilities are of a high standard, staff are pleasant and helpful, pleasant overall experience..!!",5,2017,07,23
119,40th Birthday Treat,"I booked the Sunborn as a very special treat for my partners fortieth birthday. The yacht is extremely beautiful and we were so excited when we arrived. 

On the Thursday night prior to our arrival I phoned the hotel to upgrade and spoke to a lady who said there were river view rooms available and also junior suites. I booked a river view upgrade and was told the £20 would be charged to me when we arrived. We really wanted the river view rather than dock view because it makes quite a big difference. With the dock view essentially your just getting a view that you would do staying in a regular hotel. The river view is what makes staying on the yacht more real!

On arrival we were told I couldn't have the river view. Despite being told I had been successfully upgraded on the Thursday there were no rooms available when we got there. I was so upset about this as it was really why I was staying at the Sunborn. The lady I spoke to on the phone didn't think to call me back and explain, had she done this I would have taken a junior suite but by the time we'd got to the hotel this was not an option. The hotel did offer a complementary breakfast, this was a kind gesture but little consolation. 

When we got to the room we were given the carpet was disgusting, covered in very worrying looking brown stains! I went back to reception as wasn't very happy about this, and the receptionist was actually quite abrupt with me. We were moved to another room which was cleaner but the view from both rooms wasn't great. We could have stayed at the other hotels locally and got the river view we desperately wanted for a lot less money. 

The bar was nice however the service was so very slow. My partner ordered a drink whilst waiting for me to sort the room out, I joined him two minutes later and the service was so slow that he'd finished his drink before I'd even had my order taken so I didn't bother. 

The hotel is beautiful but the room mix up was a huge, massive disappointment and really upset me a lot. We rarely get away as have three children and both work in stressful jobs so this was a very special treat for my partners fortieth. These mix ups just shouldn't happen.",2,2017,07,23
119,No atmosphere,"We stayed here for our 20th wedding anniversary last Wednesday.  My husband had ordered a bouquet of flowers to be in the room from a local florist and the hotel called him in the morning to ask if he wanted the flowers put in the room. Of course he agreed to have them ready for our arrival, but when we went into the room they were not there.  No you a big thing you may say, but for this special occasion he wanted it to be perfect. He had to go to reception and ask for them to be deliver to the room. The room itself was lovely but the whole ambiance of the boat was Not very atmospheric at all. It was like being in a four star hotel. The food was excellent Borge evening and breakfast, but a bit cheeky in the bar adding an12.5% fee to the coat of the extortionate price of the drinks. We like luxury and are happy to pay for it but felt a bit disappointed overall for a special occasion.  The guy on check out was quite curt and didn't ask if we enjoyed ourselves.  Overall a lack of atmosphere, ambiance and attention to detail. Would we stay here again? Probably not unless we needed the convenience of the location.",3,2017,07,23
119,Novelty Hotel,"I'd stumbled across pictures of this hotel a couple of years ago and wanted to take my daughter somewhere a bit different for her birthday on our trip to London. 

We really enjoyed our one night stay including breakfast. There was an issue with our room but this was quickly and professionally resolved by the manager. 

I can really recommend this hotel if you are wanting something a little different. ",4,2017,07,23
119,Amazing Floating Hotel,"We stayed here for our 35th Wedding Anniversary This floating super-yacht hotel is moored in the Royal Victoria Docks and the Emirates cable cars are nearby.
We had the amazing Executive River View Room with its beautiful wooden surroundings and small private balcony. The bathroom was stunning with luxury Molton Brown toiletries and big fluffy bath towels. 
Our evening meal at the Lands End Restaurant, which had amazing views of the city and the surrounding docklands. The food was absolutely delicious and staff were welcoming and the service was superb. They presented us with a lovely message on a serving chalk board that said ""Happy Anniversary"". We were so moved .....Thank you:)",5,2017,07,22
119,A surprise birthday weekend,"My partner took me here for a surprise birthday weekend and it was a wonderful surprise!
An amazing yacht-hotel, very luxurious.
Beautiful room with balcony, and river view.
free wifi (and an ipad in the room) lovely bathroom.
We had the added touch of chocolates and ""towel swans"" with rose petals on the bed, a lovely touch.
The service in the whole hotel was excellent wherever we went, with very polite and friendly staff.
Dinner was good and also breakfast , which was buffet style.
All in all an excellent weekend and well worth a visit....highly recommended ! 
The only downside, if I were to choose one, was the price of the drinks which did seem rather extortionate, but maybe the norm for london",5,2017,07,20
119,Definately will float your boat !,We stayed here as a surprise for my daughters birthday. The boat is lovely at night and you get in a lift and go in a lift down to reception. The staff were lovely. There is a lot of shiny metal which adds to the atmosphere of opulence. We had a reasonably priced snack in the bar area and next morning had breakfast which was £7.50 before 9am. Lovely and a bargain.,4,2017,07,19
119,Afternoon Tea,"We were hoping for a smart but relaxed atmosphere, away from the large well known hotels and got exactly what we wanted.  We opted for the Under the Sea tea without champagne and were served fish themed sandwiches, scones and beautiful delicate pastries and cakes ( way too much to eat, so we brought away a doggy bag!)  We had a table overlooking the water and skyline of London and were extremely well looked after.  The choice of teas was impressive and original and we were able to try a couple of different varieties.  Following tea we moved to the Sundown bar and sampled a couple of the many gin cocktails on offer, sitting on the deck watching the sun go down. A truly wonderful way to spend and afternoon/evening and many thanks to Ines and Cozmin who looked after us so well.",5,2017,07,19
119,Sunborn Revisited,"Sunborn Revisited
This was our second stay on the Sunborn Yacht hotel London. Situated in the Royal Victoria Docks it is ideally placed for stunning views of the city, with the Emirates cable car also at hand to take you directly to the o2 stadium. Canary Wharf looms in the distance and the Docklands Light Railway is close at hand to link you to the vibrancy of the city of London. 
On this occasion we stayed in an Executive Riverview room overlooking the dock and sporting a small but functional balcony. The room was spacious, comfortable and well equipped with tea and coffee making facilities (capsule coffee maker as opposed to the usual sachets of instant coffee that many hotels provide), safe,hair dryer, iron, ironing board and towelling robes and slippers for that added  bit of luxury. There was also a bedside tablet and wifi and tasteful bedroom furniture completing a restful feel to the room that sported views of the dock through sliding balcony doors.
The Executive Riverview rooms are really worth booking if your budget allows but the whole experience of staying on the ship/hotel? is one to put on your bucket list if only for the concept of hotel accommodation in a luxury yacht in one of the busiest and appealing cities in the world.
Entering via lift to reception there is a welcoming reception area located next to impressive spiralling stairs giving a sense of the luxury one would expect on a cruise liner. Staff are friendly and professional and the breakfast, if opted for, is a well presented buffet arrangement that will set you up for your visit to the city.
Although the location is not city centre it is close enough to reach all the tourist attractions and business centres in London. If this is a leisure, sightseeing trip for you then I would recommend careful planning . On this, our latest visit, we arranged a busy day in London culminating in a relaxing late evening on the yacht. Late night revellers might find the hotel a bit out of the way but for the majority of holiday makers and business people this is an excellent option, situated in a regenerated, historic part of the city of London.",5,2017,07,17
119,Away from the norm,"We stayed here for 1 night .The hotel is next to the Excel exhibition centre  ,moored on Victoria Dock (it does not move).Easy to reach on the DLR  get off at Victoria Dock Station  it's a 5 minute walk.
Our room was very spacious  with a King size bed  and sitting area a small balcony  with 2 deck chairs our room was a river view 2016 include in our booking was a  buffet breakfast 
Also in the room was the usual  extras tea/coffee  maker ,tv,fridge,bathrobes,safe and a adequate en-suite bathroom
The Hotel is served  by room key activated lifts .The Reception Area is very plush with a central gilded staircase. The Reception team are very good .just behind the Reception is a spacious lomge bar which opens out onto the small deck area 
The Lands  End Restaurant is on the 4th deck .
In all a bit of a different place to stay ,ideal for Excel,02,and Westerfield (Stratford)
Bit further to travel for the West end  around 46 minutes by trains",5,2017,07,16
119,Best cocktails,"We couldn't find our favourite cocktail on the menu, they all sounded lovely, but we wanted our favourite. 
The bar staff were very accommodating and made us a pornstar martini and an amaretto sour, which wasn't on the menu, but still made to perfection! One of the best we have had, anywhere in London! 
Must visit! ",5,2017,07,15
119,Sunborn London,We have booked to stay one night on this fantastic Yacht on 15th July 2017. We have had great service from Jay the head barman. He recommended drinks for both of us to try. We sat outside the stern of the  yacht enjoying views over London in the twilight. I would recommend staying in this hotel it's something a little bit different.,5,2017,07,15
119,"Quiet, reasonably priced luxury for a special anniversary","Loved walking across the bridge to arrive at this unique hotel. When we got in our room after a long day of shopping the big comfy bed was amazing, the sea view was relaxing. My husband loved the clean dimly lit bathroom. The breakfast in the morning  (not included in our price) was gorgeous, fresh fruit, lovely fry up, pastries, cereals. Really big selection. 
We loved the details, the staircase, big windows in the foyer, the staff spoke good English x ",5,2017,07,15
119,"Great location, will be back!","Lovely hotel, staff helpful and friendly.  We were able to leave our cases as we arrived before we were able to check in and went into Central London for lunch.  They put our cases in our room once it was ready.  The transport is great, we used the cable car and then the Thames clipper service to London Bridge Pier and then came back by tube and DLR.  Can not fault this hotel, will definitely be back again!",5,2017,07,15
119,Purpose Built Luxury Experience.,An impromptu stay forced by delayed travel arrangements. So lucky to get last minute availability. I've wanted to stay here ever since a colleague had the good fortune to stay and spoke highly about his experience. The central staircase is every bit as impressive as it is intended to be. Staff in reception are welcoming and efficient and happy to discuss your requirements and offer advice. My room was everything you could imagine a luxury suite aboard a cruise liner to be and best of all I had a balcony.  I had an early departure so did not get to enjoy the breakfast my colleague had spoke so highly about but checkout was fast and easy. All in all this felt more like a holiday than a business trip. only down side was the loud crude and drunken behaviour of a group of 'city' business types full of themselves and intent on their own self gratification to the detriment of those around them.,5,2017,07,15
119,"Lovely Hotel, Location a little far","We knew the location of this hotel wasn';t central but with such a stunning and different hotel, thought it would be something different.

The hotel is lovely and as good as the pictures. The interior is traditional which some people may think is dated but in reality is just fitting to the type of hotel.

We went here for our 10th Year Anniversary and really enjoyed all the weekend here.

Would come again.",4,2017,07,15
119,Lovely hotel,"Stayed here for my partners birthday.
We only had a standard room but it was very big and spacious. 
Molton brown complementary toiletries were lovely.
Beautiful place, especially having a drink on the deck looking across to London. 
Food isn't greatly priced. Room service is expensive but it's a very posh venue so was expected.
Staff lovely and friendly. No problems at all.
Room was spacious. 
Only downside was Lots of stains on the carpet which was a bit off putting and our double bed was two singles pushed together?? But only thing I could fault really .
Parked in the excel car park. Was £15 for 24 hours.",5,2017,07,14
119,A lovely Place to Stay,"Attending a weekend event at Excel in London UK, the Sunborn Hotel made a delightful base. I had booked one of their basic cabins for two nights and it was superb, really well appointed and oh so spacious. It looked out onto a vast open space and was both extremely quiet and restful too. I was depending on the fridge for dietary requirements and was annoyed that it was not working. According to the maintenance man, who fixed it for me, it had probably not been working for a while. Every day the room staff had put bottles of water in the fridge and had not even noticed that the fridge light was not working.  The shower room was spacious, well-equipped and offering a lovely hot power shower at all times when I used it.

On arrival I found the reception staff difficult to deal with. I had paid in advance in full for my cabin, but was told I had to agree to paying a further charge of £40 per night in advance to cover possible incidental expenses. I prevaricated and was given a lot of angst in broken English about company policy etc etc. In the end I agreed a £40 authority on my credit card for 24 hours to be continued, if not used after 24 hours, for the second day,  I think to demand a cash charge, which if not used, would take five days to be returned to my card was totally unacceptable.

After a rather disturbing reception upon arrival, I asked to book for dinner as, being alone, I prefer to eat as an in house guest.  I was eventually told there was no table available in the restaurant for either night. The atmosphere was frosty and unwelcoming.  The reception staff basically did their job, but made me feel very unwelcome.

It was possible to order from the bar menu for snacks, but as a coeliac ( informed at time of booking) most snacks were unsuitable as they were based on bread etc. Luckily I was able to cope with my own supplies, the local convenience store and managing to arrange for the fridge to be fixed.

My room rate included a 15% discount on food and beverages, but when I did order a bar snack, I had to argue for this discount to be deducted from the bill.  At my check out at 8.0am Sunday morning, it took for ever to complete the formalities almost all of which had been prepaid. Two receptionists were involved as the 'computers were running slow'. How they coped at busy times I do not know.

To summarise, I loved the situation, the accommodation, the quality of the experience. The general staff were friendly and really helpful, but the reception staff and any dealings with them were difficult and unsatisfactory. 

I would certainly stay there again as the cabin space and general ambiance is superb. I have no problem paying for my cabin in advance, butI would refuse to pay in advance for daily charges that I am unlikely to incur. I think this is a totally unacceptable charge.",4,2017,07,14
119,"""Absolutely stunning in every way""","The service was outstanding, totally slick and attentive from the moment we arrived to when we left. Totally memorable, and the staff made it very special!  Highly recommend a stay here for those that want to treat themselves!   
",5,2017,07,14
119,Fantastic place to stay,"We stayed here overnight as part of a weekend in London. The staff at reception were very helpful, as were the waitresses in the restaurant where we had afternoon tea.

The room was huge with ample wardrobe space, a large shower, a very large bed and a seating area. It was very quiet even though it was busy. We chose a river facing room.
There are places to eat in the dock area nearby and around the Excel centre (which is right next door). 
Travel into central London by public transport can be done by the Docklands Light railway (station 10 minutes away) or by crossing the dock by cable car to North Greenwich (and the O2) yo have the choice of either the tube or a river trip. if you do not visit London often I would recommend the cable car and boat option one way to get good views of the city. But allow plenty of time which ever option you choose.
We had a fantastic relaxing stay and hope to return with family in the future.",5,2017,07,13
119,Fantastic yacht hotel ,"Amazing overnight stay , outstanding quality, food was really good but the service was outstanding in all areas , Gabriela was amazing , exec room was spotless , great views , not the  cheapest , but well worth a treat ",5,2017,07,13
119,Wonderful escape!,"Beautiful yacht hotel, something very different to a normal hotel. The cabin was large, well furnished with two wardrobes, lovely comfortable bed, sofa, coffee machine, chairs on a small balcony, river view, and very clean. Food in the restaurant was amazing! Staff very friendly and most helpful.",5,2017,07,12
119,Great Experience mostly,A wonderful stay at the Sunborn yacht hotel. Right from arrival the staff made us feel so welcome and our room 1040 was huge with a king bed and a lounge area with views across the dock. Close to the Emirates Air Line for the spectacular ride across the Thames and a 5 minute walk from Royal Victoria DLR. Couldn't fault at all apart from the lady loudly talking on her mobile phone on the deck on our first night whilst everybody was relaxing with drinks. Ironically telling her friend how great it was while ruining the moment for everybody else. Oh well I guess that's normal ,5,2017,07,12
119,Highly recommended,"I booked a deal through lastminute for an executive river view room, a food platter at the bar and a massage for myself and my partner. What a fabulous time we had, great location, lovely room, brilliant staff and a lovely relaxing massage. Would definitely do this again. ",5,2017,07,12
119,Amazing Service,"For the 2nd year in a row 30 of us went there for a business trip, had an amazing time we all loved it. Impeccable service, amazing bar staff, many thanks to Nico, Jay and the best cocktail maker ever Alexandro. See you next year!",5,2017,07,12
119,All Tinsel and Glitter,"Very disappointing. The idea of a yacht on the water sounds wonderful, but didn't hit the marks excepted. Clean, roomy and comfortable it was, but it did not have warmth, or vibe that you find in other hotel locations. The limos and taxis can't get anywhere near the front entrance, so be ready to drag your bags around the corner. The balconies did have a great view of 02 and the gondolas were handy to get there. I will stick with cruise ships for sea and river experiences. The staff did the best with what they had to work with, no bad review for them.",3,2017,07,12
119,Sunborn Anniversary!!!,"Stayed at Sunborn Yacht for our wedding anniversary for 2 nights and it was surprising unexpected. 

Reception: We checked in at 17:30 and the check in process was smooth. She gave us a brief explanation of the areas on the yacht. One of the room card was not working and the reception sorted it out quickly. The reception area looked stunning like something out of a movie set.  And with my love for chandeliers, it looked gorgeous as a welcome entry. We also had a problem with the jacuzzi water not draining so we mentioned to the reception and when we came back it was sorted. Also would like to say thanks to the maid who serviced the room. 

Accommodation: Booked an Executive Riverside View Room and were on the 4th floor (Room 4040). As you walked in, we were quite surprised how big the place was. It had the living space with dinning table and coffee machine. The fridge had complimentary soft drinks, alcoholic drinks  and crisps. A massive balcony facing the river, Excel, bridge, Airport, the O2 Arena, Emirates Cable Car and other landmarks over the Canary Wharf as it was the corner room. The bedroom had a kind size bed and river view. We asked to have rose petals with our initials and chocolates, which was done beautifully (Extra charge while booking £40). From the bedroom, you walked into the bathroom and OMG it blew me. The bathroom was massive with a jacuzzi, steam room, 2 shower heads with Molten Brown toiletries. There is also a separate WC.

Bar: one of the evening, we went to the bar area to have a drink. There was not a mojito on the list, so I asked if they could make me one but was told no as they don't have the ingredients and not on the menu list. But from the menu all the ingredients for the mojito was listed. This was the only issue we had. We watched the moonlight and the river with the night view of the city which was really romantic.

Location: We got off at Royal Victoria DLR station and short walk of 10 mins. There are few restaurants nearby. The Emirates Cable Car is a must do, the view is amazing. This takes you to North Greenwich (O2 Arena). The city Airport is nearby so quite enjoyed watching the planes pass by. We walked across the foot bridge near the Sunborn Hotel. This was a good walk with nice views. There a Thai restaurant (Nakhon Thai), which was really good.

Overall, this was a lovely romantic getaway, even though being a Londoner, We felt like we were somewhere else. Compared to other hotels in London and the price we paid, this really has the wow factor and worth it. We will definitely recommend this place and this won't be our last visit at this beautiful place. X",5,2017,07,11
119,Fantastic place! Most comfortable bed!! ,Only stayed for one night! Would loved to have stayed longer and will definitely book again!! Very friendly staff beautiful hotel situated in a fantastic area!! Had a balcony on our room with a table and chairs which was really lovely! The bed was the most comfortable bed me and my partner had ever slept in!! It was amazing! The sheets and duvet and pillows where so comfortable and the curtains blocked out all light!! ,5,2017,07,11
119,Lovely ,"My partner had this booked as a little surprise for my birthday.. and first time in London! It was a beautiful hotel. When we got there the systems were down so they couldn't check us in straight away but that wasn't a problem because I'm the weather was gorgeous and we sat outside on the back of the boat taking in the view with a cheeky beverage! The yacht was really easy to find and the location was good! There were some restaurants around the yacht if you didn't feel like eating there and the 02 arena was just a cable car ride away! Lovely seeing the views from there. 
Free wifi and rooms were very comfy, I just didn't utilise the yacht enough to get my money's worth because I was out exploring London! 

I would recommend anyone to stay there nether the less.  ",5,2017,07,11
119,🎂🍾Birthday Treat🎂🍾,"Stayed at the Sunborn Yacht Hotel in London for one night for my Birthday had the package deal where you get petals on the bed & chocolate in the room plus a set evening meal & breakfast provided in package.We payed for a room to have a balcony that overlooked the o2 side,we was disappointed to think we payed a lot of money to stop one night to find stained carpets which to me in a high standard place like this you wouldn't get but clearly not & I'm sure this needs addressing & anybody is going to book here London City Airport is near to the hotel so you will get lots of planes flying over so if you want piece & quiet think not🛫 The set menu we had in the evening which was provided in are package was lovely & so was breakfast the only let down was the room with the stained carpets & I no to some people it's nothing but the price you pay should reflect on the standards & clearly this is not the case but overall we had a pleasant stay.",4,2017,07,11
119,Great,"Lovely room, great staff, friendly and professional. Bar bill was a tad eye watering. Highly recommend this experience of a hotel. We stayed there after a night at the O2 watching Mrs Brown's Boys. Did not eat here so can't comment about the food.",4,2017,07,11
119,Just one night for a rest,"We booked this  venue through Secret Escapes for a one night stay out of curiosity really.On arrival the reception staff were excellent and we were given the key to our stateroom which was spacious with a nice balcony. The facilities provided were adequate and the coffee machine was a nice addition, the bed was clean and comfortable. The main surprise for us was the state of the carpet which had stains of drink all over it and on one side of the bed someone had vomited , the carpet needed a real deep clean, we brought this fact to the notice of the staff who offered another room but this one had no carpet at all, so we decided to remain where we were.All went well and in the evening we went to the restaurant for dinner, we were given menus to choose from, then when we came to give our order we were advised that these were the wrong menus and the staff went away, then we sat and looked at the other members eating for a good fifteen minutes when the staff returned with the ""Correct"" menus. at no time was there any apology and at no time did the restaurant manager come to explain why the error ocurred. we then enjoyed our meal.The breakfast next morning was adequate. Now this venue is advertised as a ""luxury"" yacht hotel. Luxury it wasnt !! The public areas needed a clean and whoever is the manager of this venue needs to make sure that a daily check is followed. On the whole we enjoyed our short break it is very close to London City Airport, so your pre dinner drinks on the terrace a marred by the sound of the planes taking off  at regular intervals, so the rest we were seeking was marred and we wont be returning. Sorry Sunborn.",4,2017,07,11
119,Not what we expected but good location,"Not the standard we expected. Rooms were good size and well appointed but service was lacking in all areas... Reception, bar and restaurant staff. 
Breakfast was just awful.. Poor quality and cold.
We paid full whack for our weekend ... But many there on wowcher or possibly Groupon deals... So not as exclusive as we expected.
But great location.. Walking distance to London city airport.... Close to O2",3,2017,07,11
119,Silver Anniversary present from my wife,"my wife surprised me for our 25th Wedding Anniversary by booking a night at this magnificent floating hotel and lunch, after spending the previous evening at another hotel and an evening with family celebrating, we had a lovely relaxing day/evening trying to cure a lingering hangover, this was just what the doctor ordered, prior to our cabin being ready, we sat on the bar deck having a few drinks in the glorious sunshine, before seeing our cabin once prepared, my wife booked a late lunch in the restaurant which was absolutely gorgeous, my wife ordered the Pork belly and I had the seabass, both amazingly presented and tasting, the yacht is moored just outside the excel centre so in the evening we had a stroll around, which was an amazing place to spend time, our cabin was glorious and made for a exceptional stay, thank you",5,2017,07,11
119,A special trip to London,"We were coming to London for my wifes 50th birthday and wanted to stay somewhere special but not really expensive.
The sunborn yacht hotel provides a great alternative to london hotels and all the traffic and noise. We found it quiet, the rooms were spacious and sitting in the bar at the back of the boat in the evening looking at the lights of london across the water was so different from the hustle and bustle of london during the day.
I paid for a birthday cake and some wine to be placed in the room as a surprise and my wife was pleased to see the banners and glitter and even some ballons too. 
Breakfast was good and a great selection, ideal for preparing for a busy day. It is slightly expensive at £19.95 especially if you don't choose the cooked option.
We didn't try the restaurant as we were at a show in the evening but it is a great setting.
It is a short walk from the DLR and the Emirates Airline (cable car across the thames) which link easily with the underground.
Overall we had a great stay, the staff were all pleasant, and would love to visit again.",4,2017,07,11
119,"Excellent location for Excel, novel experience","I wasn't on the yacht very long, but the rooms were large, comfortable and pleasant. There was also the novelty of being on a ship! Incredible location for Excel, with fantastic views across the Thames that really make you feel 'at-peace'. Staff were friendly and helpful, no queues checking in or out. Wifi too was good.",4,2017,07,11
119,Great stay,Beautiful hotel. Really nice helpful staff.room serviced every morning. Breakfasts were beautiful. Great location. Not far from the O2 arena which you use emerates sky line to get too. Very easy to get too buy the tube from kings cross. The tube station is a five minute walk from the hotel.,5,2017,07,11
119,Great location for O2 but poor service,"We were booked in here for one night as a present for our wedding anniversary, bought by our daughters, and also for a show at the O2.
The Sunborn is brilliant for the O2 as it is only a couple of  minutes walk to the Emirates cable car then over the Thames with another few minutes walk to the arena, and only £4.50 each way per person.

The room we had-a classic dock side suite (1005), was very large with a separate sitting area, coffee machine, and a  fridge with free water. It also had a very nice bathroom with Moulton Brown products and plenty of hot water. The bedroom had a king size bed and a Sony tablet that you can use to browse the Internet and also explore the hotel facilities. The carpet was a bit untidy and seemed to be lifting in places but apart from that a very nice place to stay in.

The sun deck bar is very nice to sit on and take in the views( if the sun is shining I guess) and you can see the O2, the planes coming in to the city airport and also the marina from it.

The only let down was the overall service, I rang before leaving to ask what time check in was and after holding for 8-10 mins I hung up as it was never answered by a human. On arrival I tried to drop bags off at the yacht but nobody answered the barrier intercom. Finally we went on the sun deck for a drink and were given a glass of water immediately which was a nice touch as it was a really hot day, shame it was warm ( a bit of ice in it would have been good). We ordered our drinks and after 20 mins, just as I was going to ask what had happened to our drinks, the waitress came over with them and no, it was not that busy, we then got another glass of water bought over, and again still warm. 

So to sum up, good location for O2 and Excel, large rooms, somewhere different to stay in this area but let down by the service.",4,2017,07,10
119,A break overnight stay A meal at the restaurant two course included group on voucher,Every think was absolutely amazing from start to finish from entering the hotel reception very friendly very helpful the bar staff also very friendly and very helpful on the staff very nice Service 110% food was absolutely amazing The room they upgraded it was absolutely outstanding  room and the views when you are sitting in the bar area and the restaurant unbelievable as it was an anniversary they upgraded our room decorated the room with rose petals champagne and chocolates in the room from start to finish everything was absolutely beautiful highly recommend this hotel  to anybody I've stayed in a lot of hotels in London by fair this is the best host i've stayed in in every way every think was absolutely amazing definitely 10 out of 10 for me,5,2017,07,10
119,Something different,"Stayed onboard theSunbourne as part of a 70th birthday treat for my dad. He loved the boat; great spacious room, well equipped and a fabulous outdoor terrace bar to admire the quire spectacular view of the city skyline and the O2. You can sometimes feel a little hemmed in when staying in busy the busy capital city but there is open space and a sense of peacefulness here. The staff and were great. I recommend.",5,2017,07,08
119,Definitely not a spa break,"Last night I tried to book a massage for this morning but the lovely guys on reception didn't know how to only to take my room number etc.  This morning at 8.30 I requested a massage by the online booking/message system.  By 9 am the receptionist said 'she will be here in a minute', by 10 o'clock I was told that she would be here soon, I said can't you just check and see if she has a slot rather than me waiting around.  They said no they couldn't contact her and to be patient.  By 10.20 Olga rang my room but I had lost the opportunity for an early massage before check out - so it seems the 'spa' is Olga in a treatment room and if she is not there nothing can be checked or booked.  I thought the process was flawed but the receptionists couldn't see what my issue was.  Shame because the rest of the overnight stay was great.",3,2017,07,07
119,Lush Unique Experience,What a great place ! From the moment we stepped onboard we were greeted with friendly staff and a lush decor that was well air conditioned. Our room was just as good as it looked from the professional photos on Tripadvisor and could not fault it in any way. We will definitely be returning and would recommend it to anyone.,5,2017,07,07
119,Something Different,"I Stayed 2 nights here while on a Business trip. I was extremely convenient for the DLR and the Conference Centre - both within walking distance.
You know you are in for something different as soon as you reach reception - its very plush and luxurious. My room ( Cabin ) was lovely and had a small balcony so you could look out over the water. The weather wasn't great but I would recommend the views from the Bar area and outside on deck if you get the chance. 
It was expensive to stay there - but well worth it if you are looking for a treat .
 Only one tiny suggestion - it would have been really helpful if the hotel had some umbrellas either for hire or to borrow -as its quite exposed on the walk from the entrance to the road.",4,2017,07,06
119,Sunborn Yatch Hotel - Excel centre,Very very convenient for the Excel centre the hotel yacht being moored 200 yards from the main entrance - excellent facilities equal to a cruise ship/decent hotel in terms of rooms etc short taxi ride to Canary Wharf  - train station into the city and west end within walking distance (500 yards or so) Could not fault the service in any way,5,2017,07,06
119,Unique experience,"Reasonably plush and certainly unique. Great surprise for a loved one with the individuality of it all. Room very comfortable with quality refreshments and toiletries. It's a bit far out of London itself but great location for O2 or the Excel and London City Airport . Fantastic views into the city. Our only disappointment was looking forward to a night cap when returning at 11.30 pm after a show, to be very firmly told that the bar was closed. Not good customer service and certainly not what I'd expect from a luxury hotel. We shopped around and found a good deal for our stay which made it very good value.",4,2017,07,06
119,Visit to london,"Was looking forward to staying on the sunborn 
Very good greeting at reception. Room very nice and spacious with a fantastic view of the river. Bed comfy and room very clean.  Went to the bar for a few cocktails. Very good bar. However tried to book an evening meal in the restaurant but full. I was at the hotel to try it out for celebrations next year with friends, so wanted to try the restaurant but could only have a burger in the bar. 
Very good nights sleep, you could not feel you were on water. Next morning breakfast was a buffet, very expensive @ £19.50. The food was not hot enough and very bland.  Even coffee not hot. This was the one thing that let down the stay. ",3,2017,07,05
119,Hotel with a difference!,"Enjoyed our short stay wish we could have stayed longer to use all the facilities 
Very clean
So convenient for the concert & shopping  
The bar service was a little slow tho 
Definitely a hotel with a difference 
Would recommend & definitely return ",5,2017,07,04
119,bit of posh,"well its a novelty, and the kids loved it. quiet location which is what I wanted and great access to the DLR. didn't eat at the hotel as id spent all my money on the room haha great stay and an experience for the kids first time in London.",4,2017,07,04
119,Distinctive,"Stayed for a couple of nights in June in a Yacht Executive guest room with a balcony overlooking the quayside.

The room was surprisingly spacious and scrupulously clean, with all of the facilities that you would expect from accommodation that is a cut above the norm. The bed was exceptionally comfortable and, given its location in Royal Victoria Dock, it is very quiet and peaceful, meaning that a good nights sleep is assured.

There is a restaurant which serves great food and a bar and drinking area aft, manned by very friendly staff. Plus, as alternative options, there is a choice of restaurants and bars just a short walk away or mainstream London is a £20 taxi ride.

Staying here was a delight and a return stay is very much on the cards.",5,2017,07,04
119,Bar not replenished ,"Ok, we decided to stay here as it was hubby's birthday and we were off to see Adele on her last night in concert. Adeles last two dates were cancelled so we thought we could make the most of the extra time on the yacht. The king size room with balcony was great, although a huge black stain was on the carpet but didn't ruin our stay. The weather was amazing and sitting on the balcony in the sun was like being abroad. As it was so hot we decide with our two friends to go and have cocktails. We sat on the deck outside and chose four cocktails. The waitress came and told us they didn't have the ingredients to make any cocktails so we asked for Kopperberg cider, to which we were told they hadn't any, they had ran out. All we were told they had was draught beer which we don't drink. We decided then to go out and find a pub. It was a tad disappointing but it didn't ruin our stay, it just meant we didn't part with £55 per round 👍🏻 our overall stay was enjoyable, beds are comfy, rooms are clean and the cleaners are friendly. However the lady that checked us in was so friendly and maybe more of the reception/bar staff could learn from her as they lack customer service skills. A few tweeks and you will have a near perfect hotel. Would def return! ",4,2017,07,04
119,Wonderful ,"I was looking for a hotel which was conveniently placed, good quality and away from the standard hustle and bustle of central London. The Sunborn ticked every box! Beautiful on the inside and out, modern and well kept interior. Staff were lovely and helpful, rooms were spacious and very comfortable. Will definitely return and recommend! ",5,2017,07,03
119,Amazing staff!!!,"We had a girls night out on Friday and to be honest we were amazed by staff. Specially JAY, HICO and GITANA. Woow they were so professional, attentive, with the perfect humour sense! We will be back definitely. ",5,2017,07,02
119,Excellent customer service,"Spent one night on the yacht hotel in late June to celebrate an ""important"" birthday. Our room/cabin was great and had a small balcony with a view over the dock. As the hotel were aware of the celebration, we received an invite to the bar on the top deck for complimentary drinks. We were also given a table for dinner with a great view of the dock. Dinner was excellent - especially the fish starter and halibut main course. The customer service was excellent throughout. As expected, the drinks were rather pricey. Our only disappointment was that the breakfast was a buffet and, as is often the case in hotels across the world, most of the components of the full English were only lukewarm.",4,2017,07,01
119,UNIQUE HOTEL EXPERIENCE,"My wife and I stayed at the Sunborn London for one night, Dinner and Room, to celebrate our Wedding Anniversary. We stayed in an Executive River View Room which we both really liked. Upon arrival to our room there was a welcome card wishing us a Happy Anniversary with some very tasty Truffle Chocolates. The room was quite a good size with a seating area, usual coffee maker, mini bar and TV (if you like watching TV whilst away, certainly not for us) and it has a nice little balcony. The bathroom has a large shower but no bath tub, it has good quality Molton Brown toiletries. The room was spotlessly clean as was the rest of the Yacht. All the staff we dealt with were very friendly and professional. We had dinner in the restaurant, drinks in the bar then retired to our room. The restaurant food and service was excellent. Overall a great dinner and great hotel experience.",4,2017,07,01
119,Difficult to review,"I stayed in this hotel during a business trip to ifsec excel.
The hotel staff was friendly and helpful and the room was great.
Looking at the price tag the value for money is there.
But there is a catch.
I was there during an event and the staff could not handle the presure and the sometimes huge numbers of gasts and visitors
This was reflected in the service level during those peaktimes heavenly which was to pitty
Even when the rush was over and only the hotel guests where there the staff seemed like taking a break 
Not only the service was impacted but ineven think the revenue of the hotel has taken impact because we could not order
So beer and food is fine (if you can get it)
Rooms are great but staff needs more guidance.
So if there is an event at the excel be aware",3,2017,06,30
119,Gorgeous!,"A true tour de force of excellence - from the very friendly and efficient welcome, to the sumptuous surroundings of the bar and resteraunt and the especially splendour of the central staircase....

...carried through to the sheer gorgeousness of my room, a suite, with all you could want and more

Private deck, meeting table, bar, lounge, wet rooms, 5 showers, jacuzzi and whirlpool and of course the sauna room

Splendid, gorgeous, lovely decadence - thank you

😀😀😀👍👍👍",5,2017,06,29
119,Proposal at the Sunborn London,My new fiancée and I had a fantastic time at the Sunborn and everyone involved were great and very helpful. I paid a little more as I booked directly with the hotel and to have have a room facing the river but overall I am glad I decided to use the Sunborn for my proposal and grateful for the excellent service provided.,4,2017,06,29
119,Amazing,"Stayed here for my Birthday, what an absolute gem !!!
We stayed in the executive room with river view, lovely room ,bed was amazing, Room service was great and Breakfast in bed was lovely too, We had a full English which can be ordered via a tablet in your room.
Molton Brown toiletries always nice.

Its a must !",5,2017,06,28
119,"Gorgeous view, amazing service and incredible view!","I went to Sunborn for their afternoon tea. Because of its location, it was amazingly quiet, something you don't often get in London. I chose the 'under the sea' menu, since it's not your standard London afternoon tea and I was definitely not disappointed. I would thoroughly recommend this even if just for the decor and views! 10/10 would recommend.",5,2017,06,27
119,Very unique hotel experience,The yacht has the WOW factor the staff were super efficient what a smooth operation this place is! Our room had a river view & a small terrace where we sat & had a glass of wine in the sunshine.The view from the dining room was amazing as the lights came on all the way down the thames & you can see the cable car coming & going.One night not enough will be back I hope.,5,2017,06,27
119,Lovely Hotel,"We stayed at this hotel with friends during a visit to see Robbie Williams in Stratford.
 The hotel itself is lovely and in a great location, easily accessed by the DLR or Uber which we used quite a bit.  We stayed in an executive room.  The bed was super comfy and the carpets were very plush and thick.  Both rooms had lots of stains on the carpets, whilst the carpets in the room were very plush, the stains are off putting.  Molton Brown miniature shampoo, conditioner, soap and shower gel is provided, this is replenished when used.  The dressing gown I used had a huge rip in the shoulder which should have been checked before letting guests use it.  Coffee and water is also provided complimentary and replenished.  Breakfast mid-week is expensive at £20.  All in all we had an enjoyable stay.",4,2017,06,27
119,Not so luxury stay,"Must say all staff here are really good and helpful.
Asked to move rooms as carpet had 3 huge stains was shown 2more rooms both with stained carpets we took the one with the least.
Rooms tidied each day but things were being missed bin not emptied on 1 occasion coffee not replenished fully and only left biscuits on 1 occasion .
Breakfast is very expensive at £20 a head it is a help yourself buffet food was not very hot in fact warm there was no white bread for  toast as had run out.
While toasting our bread the waiter had cleared our table before we had finished so had to re lay on our return to table.
Beds are very comfy and the rooms are a lovely size great for access to o2 or excel centre short walk to station",3,2017,06,25
119,If it floats your boat...🛳,"Moored on the Royal Victoria Docks, Sunborn is easily accessible via public transport, although if arriving by DLR, it is a good 10mins walk along Victoria Dock Road and up the DLR walkway towards the Excel centre.

Quiet on the weekend, the area is peaceful, and a lovely walk along the river with views of the O2 dome and Canary Wharf skyline.

The hotel is very impressive and it's sheer size is overwhelming. Whilst beautiful inside at reception and upto the restaurant it could do with an update, but it didn't detract from the grandeur of the entrance....until we were escorted to the top deck for afternoon tea. Friendly staff but it somehow lacked atmosphere when we arrived for Afternoon tea. The menu is limited to an under the sea themed tea or a vegetarian option, it is fairly standard fayre. The staff were attentive & friendly but the space in which afternoon tea was served, it felt like an empty, small, sparse deck without the shiny beautiful decor as the lower decks. It felt unfinished and had a  very corporate feel, a vacant, adaptable space fmore suited for private functions, it was very much isolated. The experience would have been much better taken in the restaurant below.

We didn't have an overnight stay but the reviews are encouraging and the concept is an appealing alternative to the nearby, standard hotels.

Whilst I loved the concept, the grandeur and spending time with a fabulous friend, I did feel that the experience was a little lacking in atmosphere, it could have been that it was a quieter time of day, but considering there isn't too much by way of bars and restaurants in the immediate area, this strikes me as a hotel that would recognise guests would need an enhanced and fuller experience of the yacht and facilities to make this a 5* experience. The afternoon tea lacked a little finesse in finish, mini cupcakes were ok but dry in consistency and the heavy blue icing was unappealing.

With a unique USP and a standout impressive venue, I hope the atmosphere improves and they take advantage of such a beautiful space to make the experience even more memorable. Apart from the obvious exterior, you may not necessarily remember you are on a boat unless tea was taken on the deck, nothing really nautical in theme and not enough to stimulate the senses after the inital awe of the exterior.

Would certainly love to come back for dinner, but the fact that it's a yacht wouldn't factor as it should.",3,2017,06,24
119,Overnight stay,"Us like most of the other guests stayed here while attending robbie williams at stratford.
Its a nice venue and the staff are excellent. The rooms are clean and the beds super comfy.
The bathroom was functional but very small. Nice molton brown products and ok towels. Only tiny bottles of shower gels but there is a stock held at reception.
Breakfast is self service. Not particularly inspiring but it meets the brief.
Overall a good london base if you are doing something in the east. ",4,2017,06,24
119,Wonderful Treat,"Great service, wonderful surroundings... beautiful experience!

We stayed in a large room and had a view over the water. The bed was huge and comfy... the bathroom was spotless with nice toiletries, the breakfast maybe needs a bit of work but this is a minor thing! The whole experience was great. We will be back!",5,2017,06,24
119,I expected more!,"I booked this for myself and my boyfriend for our birthdays , found a deal on Groupon so only cost me £250 which I thought was a good deal. Upon arrival we were greeted nicely and thankfully our room was ready! It was a boiling hot weekend around 31 degrees .. all of the air con had broken so later in the evening having a sit down dinner was not enjoyable and slightly ruined the fun of dressing up and having a nice meal as it was so so hot in the restaurant and the only thing they could provide were two tiny fans for the whole restaurant. We did complain and they very generously and quickly sorted out our problem by giving us a fan for our room and also a bottle of champagne. Can't fault them on that ! All the staff very welcoming and helpful. 
The ship itself is very outdated , the front reception is luxurious but the rest of the ship just.. isn't! It needs a revamp! I expected it to be modern and quirky but it was very old school and boring ! 
I possibly wouldn't stay here again but it was a nice experience ! ",3,2017,06,24
119,Truly excellent,"A fun Base for a London stay. Very stylish and helpful professional staff.
Good transport  to central london  without the noise and traffic.
Everything to a high standard,will definitely  be back. Has the feel of a yacht but no wave motion",5,2017,06,24
119,Disappointing,"The photos look amazing, but it has become quite tired. Every carpet is stained. The bar menu is very limited. The restaurant can accept bookings, due to kitchen problem, and for some unknown reason the more expansive room service menu can not be ordered in the bar - yes it comes from the same kitchen..

On the plus side, great location, staff are nice and the terrace bar has great views. But I did expected based on the hype.",2,2017,06,23
119,Something different in London,"We stayed here for my husbands 50th Birthday. He loved boats so I thought it would be a lovely surprise for him. We arrived by emirates cable car and walked to the yacht. The reception staff we very helpful and attentive. Our room was a family one which had views over the dock. It was very spacious and my son slept on the sofa bed. The complimentary Molten Brown toiletries were a very nice touch. The bathroom was spacious and very very clean. The bed was large and very comfortable. It was a very hot weekend and we turned the air conditioning down low, but the room still didn't get very cold it stayed about 25, which would be my only small criticism. We went out to see a show and got back at 11pm and went straight to bed, it was very quiet and we never heard any noise. We were supposed to have a complimentary tablet computer which was missing but reception soon brought us one when we advised them.we didn't book breakfast, but it all looked very nice. The yacht is in such a lovely spot and a very up and coming area, you don't feel as if you're in busy London.
I would definite recommend it for something a little bit different and a special treat in the capital!",4,2017,06,23
119,Pretty unique. Great experience. ,"We stayed at the Sunborn, following a recommendation from friends.  Me and my daughter stayed just one night, as we were going to see a concert at the 02 Arena.

Brilliant hotel. Immaculate. The service from the staff is outstanding. Air con and heating in the room - which can be controlled by the guests. 

The bed was huge and so comfortable. My daughter slept on the sofa bed and she said that was very comfortable. 

The shower was magnificent.

We had a room overlooking the river, which was wonderful. 

The whole look and ambience is of sheer luxury. We were dressed in our casuals and certainly didn't feel out of place.

The only down side is that it is located close to the London City airport and is directly on the flight path. Flights started fairly early in the morning.

It's a little pricey, but a really super experience. I'd definitely go and stay there again.
 ",5,2017,06,23
119,River view ,"Upon arriving the hotel is great to look at a real 'take your breath away' and very different to the usual hotel. Very grand on entrance. I felt like Vivien from pretty woman!!

Our room wasn't ready so we had some lovely and lively mojitos on the deck. Our room was ready though my partner was told when he booked he upgraded to a suite with a jacuzzi and a sauna. When we arrived were given a change of room without those facilities. 

The room was clean with a river view. Huge comfortable bed, massive. Really hot bathroom however couldn't work out how to turn off the underfloor heating red hot! Also the air con didn't work and it was very warm. 

Returning from our concert at guns n roses we sat with our drinks in our robes on the balcony. Lovely end
 Slept well on board... 

Breakfast was lovely both poached eggs were perfect. Wonderful choice and plenty of it. 
Would love to come again  

Wonderful treat ^_^ happy happy ",4,2017,06,23
119,What a great concept,"Perfect for the Excel Arena, it was actually cheaper than the lower cost hotels next door too. Really surprised how big the rooms were and the Gin menu was quite good, I would only ever stay here when visiting the Excel Arena. great location, great service",5,2017,06,23
119,A wonderful experience,"The room and en suite facilities were spotless. The extra facilities incl complimentary internet(in each room) was fabulous.
The staff were really polite, friendly and helpful. I have issues with glass lifts and they catered for my fear. That was so wonderful.
Security is fantastic.
I didn't try any cocktails, but they looked amazing, very professional bar tenders.
Breakfast; what an array of food to choose from.
Properly cooked and tasted lovely.
Overall an amazing experience. Thank you.",5,2017,06,22
119,"Lovely Hotel, great location.","We were going to London for a few days and were looking for somewhere near the O2.

After considering several, we decided to splash out on Sunborn as it seemed a bit different.

Getting there is straightforward - it's no more than a 10 minute walk from Royal Victoria Dock DLR station as long as you follow signs for ""Seagull Lane"" exits.

Checkin was quick & easy and our room was easy to find. 

Our room was a good size, with a huge bed and views of Royal Victoria footbridge over the dock and the houses on opposite side and we could also see up to the O2.

It was the hottest weekend of the year and the air-con struggled to make an impression on the temperature and the windows were non-opening - presumably because of being near to the waterline on a yacht

We dined at the restaurant and it was superb - top marks to the staff who were brilliant and deserved a bonus payment for working in the 30 degree heat.",5,2017,06,22
119,Mid week trip to the O2.,"It is what it says it is ""4 star"", biggest tip from me is check what is on at the Excel centre before booking, the hotel was packed with loads of people wearing security passes around there necks, although only there for one night we couldn't get near the bar, ordered a late afternoon snack at the bar, but they had run out of what we wanted, managed to run out of beer as well on the hottest day of June, ended up walking to the nearest hotel for a bit to eat.",3,2017,06,22
119,Not as good as last time,"Having stayed at this hotel previously, I was very keen to take my daughter there to stay in an executive suite.  The suite is lovely, with a nice big comfortable bed, jacuzzi bath, sauna and a huge decking balcony.  It was spotlessly clean.  There is a complimentary minibar with wine, beer and soft drinks in and there were some lovely handmade chocolates waiting for us.  There were also some nice big Molton Brown toiletries.  The plug did get stuck in the bath every time we used it and we had to keep phoning maintenance to come and get it out so we could empty the water.  They tried to make the excuse that it was the weight of a large amount of water (it is a large jacuzzi bath) so I experimented and it still got stuck even with no water in it.

However, the restaurant and bar totally let this hotel down.  Before we had arrived we had had several tense emails between ourselves and the hotel as to whether or not we could have afternoon tea as there was a 'do' in the restaurant.  They tried to offer us a different date, which I did point out was ridiculous as we wanted afternoon tea whilst we were staying at the hotel, not on a different date.  They then said that the tea would be served in the bar, fine by us.  They also demanded my credit card details in advance, even though we were staying at the hotel, I have never encountered this at any other hotel.  We were given a table right in the window with a fabulous view of the river and the O2.  However, the sandwiches were quite tasteless and the afternoon tea was nothing special.  After the concert we went to at the O2, we came back to have cocktails in the bar.  I was very surprised to find that there was no waiter service, we had to queue up at the bar to get served.  This was made much more difficult by the fact that the 'do' that had taken over the hotel for a couple of days were now taking over the bar and consisted of mainly men, who were mostly drunk and rowdy.  Some were trying to break-dance, I saw a waiter take a chair away from one who was trying to balance it on the back of his hand.  We felt very uncomfortable in the bar, particularly with the language.  So we had one cocktail and fled.  The following afternoon, we decided to try again, only to discover that they had changed the bar and the restaurant over, so the bar was now on the second floor, very confusing, no idea why.  But when we got to the bar, I was told that because of this they would not be serving cocktails!  I'm sure that whoever this company was were paying a lot of money to the hotel, but they should not forget about their core customers.  This was not my first visit, but it will be my last.

Breakfast was also nothing special, the hot food was not hot enough, and they forgot our tea, I had to ask for this twice.  In addition, our bill was brought whilst we were still in the middle of eating breakfast as if we were going to run away without paying!  We were in the top suite!

I had been really looking forward to this visit but sadly, despite all the friendly staff, I did not feel valued as a customer (spending a LOT of money) so I will not be returning.",3,2017,06,22
119,Disappointing afternoon tea,"We went for a celebration afternoon tea but were very disappointed. We arrived at our pre-booked time but were left waiting for half an hour. The staff were busy setting up for a conference and seem distracted -  we felt ignored and another fifteen minutes went before we were served our tea. We had arranged for a lacto free tea but the staff were unaware of this and couldn't offer anything much. I would have expected much better for somewhere of this standard - in fact one of the staff suggested butter would be ok and a chocolate cake was suitable.
They did offer fruit but when we suggested a sorber we were told the freezer wasn't working! The cakes for the rest of us were mediocre and the bread for the sandwiches didn't seem fresh.
Overall a very disappointing experience - we were given a discount for two afternoon teas but I would rather have paid for a higher quality afternoon tea. I would not rush back!",3,2017,06,22
119,"Incredible view, beautiful rooms, great breakfast","Felt very special arriving at The Sunborn - Loved everything about it! Beautiful room overlooking the Royal Victoria Dock. Room was very well equipped and the bed was SUPER comfy. The bathroom whilst small (as you'd expect on a yacht) was still luxurious. Delicious chocolate truffles waited us on arrival and the management very kindly also brought us a bottle of wine. We were very well looked after.
The breakfast the next morning was delicious - a great selection of hot and cold buffet.
My only slight disappointment was not being able to get a seat outside on the deck in the evening as it was too busy - This was not The Sunborn's fault - the weather was glorious so everyone wanted to be out there! 
Thanks to the team for such an enjoyable stay - we will be back!",5,2017,06,20
119,Something a bit special.,"We had 2 nights booked into this, we took the tube and it was easily enough to find. Arrived around 9.00pm and the receptionist was very polite and helpful. Found the room easily and opened the door to a very lovely room, a bit of luxury and larger than we were expecting, huge bed. We had a small balcony that looked over the dockside (grass). All the usual stuff supplied, robes, slippers, lovely soft large fluffy towels. Everything was great. We did not hear any noise and had a great sleep. We could not book a table in the restaurant but the bar food was open until late and serving, we decided to go for a walk and we eat out, a few great restaurants 5 minutes walking. Breakfast was not included and we did not eat there. All in all a lovely place to stay and really enjoyed the stay.",4,2017,06,20
119,Hot hot,"Stayed at the sunborn last weekend and loved it 
Rooms executive is large comfortable and clean. Nice view of the docks and little balcony. Only bad factor was very hot and air con was not working but we were offered a good discount for it 
My husband loved the birthday treat ",4,2017,06,20
119,Wonderful stay,"We stayed at this hotel weekending 18th June, we arrived on the friday afternoon and was greeted  by very friendly and most helpful staff at the reception. 
Our room was spacious and had a balcony view of the Royal victoria Dock which was very pleasant.
The booking was for bed,  breakfast and evening meal, again the staff were lovley, pleasant and genuinely happy to help you this could not be faulted in anyway and the food? Not a huge selection on the menu, and this is not a criticism as everything we had was cooked to perfection and presented very well .
The area was pleasant to take a stoll around after our meal.
This was a most enjoyable stay and will be looking to return.
Most highly recommended",5,2017,06,19
119,Birthday surprise,"Fantastic location, we stayed for my birthday, the weather was fantastic the ship is well presented, and the staff very welcoming, bar staff very accommodating, and provided a 5 star service.
Rooms were large with a great view of the marina. Only negative were the beds were twins push together with no mattress just to single toppers that kept separating.",4,2017,06,19
119,Birthday treat for my wife.,"When we arrived Andrea at reception asked if it was for a special occasion. We said it was for my wife's birthday and she upgraded us to the Executive suite overlooking the Royal Victoria Dock. She couldn't have been more helpful and friendly. We were amazed at the size of the suite, with a jaccuzi bath and sauna!
We had invited our children and partners to join us for dinner and changed the reservation time to slightly later so we could show them our room.
We had a pre dinner cocktail in the bar and then sat down for dinner. 
There was a corporate function in progress in a separate dining room while we had dinner and the service for us was rather slow. When we complained that the main course was taking too long to arrive the restaurant manager came straight over and apologized. All our meals and wine were immediately given to us fully complimentary. The food was absolutely delicious. Although it was a shame about the delay in service the attentiveness and willingness to please resolved the situation.
We loved our stay on the yacht and the staff couldn't have been more obliging in what could have been a frustrating evening. It was a lovely family get together.",5,2017,06,19
119,"Some highs, but disappointing overall. Save your money!!","Highs-
Loranas on reception absolutely brilliant, lovely service and very professional. 
Dinner dining was exceptional. Wait staff in the evening delivered a flawless service. 

These reasons are why they have earned 2* from me. 
HOWEVER...
Lows-
I sent two emails before checking in to ask for a birthday note etc to be left in our Executive River View room as our stay was a surprise trip for my partners birthday. I was assured these touches would be made, but they were not. Disappointing considering I've read other guests have been left Birthday notes and choccies. Inconsistent and clearly some preferential treatment going on- BAD customer service. 
Distinct smell of damp in our room, only bearable due to the fortunate good weather so could leave balcony door open to air it out.
Decor in room and hotel generally tired, cheap and in dire need of a facelift if hotel is going to claim the title of ""luxurious super yacht""
Different set of wait staff in the morning who were appallingly bad!! Forgot basics like teaspoons and cutlery which after complaining still didn't arrive so I had to pinch some from another table. Not so much as a ""good morning"" from any of them in terms of customer service. 
Breakfast lukewarm and of varying quality. Black pudding awful. I'd have been heartbroken if I'd paid the full price. 
£4 for still water... I mean come on. 

To summarise: This is NOT a 4* hotel in overall customer relations and customer service. To pay over £200 to sleep in a damp room is unacceptable. AVOID!!",2,2017,06,18
119,Overpriced - total disappointment,"We had a family room which consisted of a large double (fine) but a really poor quality tiny sofa bed for the children (aged 13 & 10) the room & in fact the whole hotel whilst very clean was tired.
The bar service was exceptionally slow & the waitress looked at me like I was insane when I asked for an artificial sweetener for my tea, as against sugar. 
It was most disappointing that you had no access to the deck at the front of the yacht.
The room was very noisy too you could hear every footstep up above & we had quite a disturbed night.
Breakfast totally extortionate at £80 for the four of us so we gave that a miss.
I would really suggest you find a nice hotel this has few facilities & is definitely not all that it makes out to be. 
Not a treat at all! ",2,2017,06,15
119,A birthday celebration,"This was my husbands 70th Birthday celebration. We thoroughly enjoyed our stay, it was so easy to access Central London by the docklands light railway, all you need is an Oyster card and you are away, so quick and easy. I would recommend this hotel as it is different! We didn't eat main meals here, only breakfast, which was OK, nothing special, either continental or full English, I did feel this was rather expensive at £14 per person for continental, but very nice.",4,2017,06,15
119,Birthday stay,I was taken to this Ship for my Birthday stay in London. Well it was an excellent stay we had a dock view window cabin. This cabin was enormous for a ship with lounge area with 2 seater estate and the bedroom area with king size bed and a very well lintel bathroom. The facilities onboard were excellent with comfortable bar lounge with outside seating and restaurant for Dunner and breakfast.  Service was of a very high quality.,5,2017,06,15
119,VERY ROCK AND ROLL!,"We stayed on this floating super yaught hotel for just one night ,we went to a concert at the o2, and it was great .The cabin was lovely, good size and very clean.The staff couldnt do enough for you  ....We had food at the bar as we were short on time but that said there was plenty of it and the quality was good.I would reccomend the cocktail list ...  nice to unwind on the deck!Great location for the o2 ..you can take the emirates cable car ,its a ten minute  thrill ride ,all the london sights ,straight to the o2 ...from the cable car terminal its just a few minutes walk...perfect We parked in the excell centre ..£20 for 24hrs ..again perfect.....sorry cant say enough good things ...were going back ! enjoy",5,2017,06,14
119,AMAZING HOTEL AND STAFF,"Hi

Just returned from staying at this Hotel/Yacht for the weekend with 24 of my friends on a hen weekend.  Wow what a hotel.  From the Manager to the staff they could not have done anymore to make us feel welcome.  Mariam we would like to especially thank you for you all did for us, you are amazing at what you do and we applaud you 

We will definitely be staying again (not all at once though lol)

Thanks again 

Julie Cotter (The Hen Weekenders)",5,2017,06,14
119,What an experience 5*++++,"I took my wife away for her 30th birthday to the sunborn hotel in London and what can I say we were completely blown away. It was amazing from the start, when we arrived we dropped our bags off in our room which was stunning, we had a personalised letter to say happy birthday and some chocolate truffles, it was spotlessly clean in every way, stylish and very spacious. As we went for a wonder we were greeted by Maryiam the customer relations who invited us for drinks as it was my birthday which was a lovely surprise, I've never met such a lovely member of staff, she made us feel special like royalty and not just like a customer, she gave that personal touch and made sure we were take care off on our stay.
The food was superb and the service was too and was a reasonable price. We will defiantly be visiting again very soon, best hotel we have stayed in.",5,2017,06,13
119,Romantic getaway!!,"Me and wife were looking for a quiet place to stay for our short getaway, from all the hotels in London (with reasonably priced) we chose Sunborn Yacht hotel located in Royal Docks and we couldn`t believe our own eyes it`s an actual ship!!! 
We had a booking for Executive Room on the channel side with a decent size balcony and very comfortable bed which we absolutely loved it!!
Staff members were really friendly and ready to help any moment. its a shame we haven`t had opportunity to try quality of the restaurant that`s why definitely coming back for next short getaway.",5,2017,06,13
119,"Fab time, only one issue","I stayed recently this weekend with my fiance.

Was a lovely stay, only issue i had was that the air con is terrible, once you have a shower the whole room gets hot quickly, even with the bathroom door closed.

Also a silly design i feel is having the hair dryer locked in the bathroom, therefore once you get out the shower your just adding more heat into the bathroom, the fan in there (if there is one) felt non existent.

Sadly even with having the air con on all night this didnt seem to make much of a difference.

Apart from this it was great, just seems a shame we had a restless night due to heat when we paid so much money for the room, i dread to think how much worse it would be on a hot night.",4,2017,06,12
119,weekend break,sunborn  London  is an amazing place to stay.staff are very friendly and helpful.we shall definetly be returning. the room was lvly   the breakfast was really nice cooked to a really high standard the rooms with a river view and balcony are really superb..,5,2017,06,12
119,Wonderful stay with my young daughter,"This was a lovely yacht and a real treat for my daughter, aged 11 years, and I.  I had booked this accommodation when I booked a concert at the O2 arena.  The yacht is extremely convenient for the O2 with a short connection on the Emirate cable car.  The accommodation is also served well by the DLR railway.

I was truly impressed as was my daughter.  The room, which was a standard twin room with dock view, was extremely spacious with gorgeous traditional wooden fittings and trimmings that accompany a traditional yacht.  The room exuded style.  The central staircase was fabulous and opulent and made a real statement.  The bar has a view to die for.  We had travelled on a very hot day and welcomed a drink in the bar.  Chairs and tables were set outside where could you enjoy a cold drink whilst marvelling at the view of Canary Wharf, the Emirates cable car and the O2.  The staff were polite and attentive.  I found the breakfast selection comprehensive and of a high standard with good presentation.  The cooked breakfast was exceptionally tasty.  Fortunately my daughter had a free breakfast since she was under 12 years otherwise it would have been rather expensive.  I cannot wait to bring my husband!",5,2017,06,11
119,A different side of London,"Have just spent two nights on the yacht and had an amazing time! The Yacht is an experience in itself but it was in an area of London that as a day tripper you are unlikely to visit. We went on the cable car to the O2 and then caught a river bus up the Thames which goes all the way to the London Eye, amongst other activities.
The food in the restaurant was excellent but I think the price of the drinks in the bar were a little steep (this may have been why people didn't seem to be having drinks before dinner?). The staff were all friendly and helpful. Cabin was much larger than a usual hotel room with all facilities. Would definitely recommend especially if going to a concert at the O2 or a function at the Excel.",5,2017,06,11
119,Birthday Celebration,"Stayed on the Sunborn for 1 night.  We booked through Secret Escapes on and had a Executive River View Room. Our deal included Dinner and Breakfast.  Both fantastic the Dinner 'Fine Dining'. The staff onboard were all very courteous and polite.
Thank you 😊 ",5,2017,06,11
119,"Excellent hotel, great locations for 02","My husband and I stayed at the Sunborn last night as we attended Take That at the 02 and decided to treat ourselves to a luxury night in London and we were not disappointed. The room was very spacious, had coffee facilities, iron and ironing board, Molton brown bathroom products and the bed was very comfy. 
The reception area was very glamorous, the drinks and food were excellent and the staff were very friendly and made us feel very welcome.
It's not a cheap stay but is a very nice treat! Will definitely stay again, worth every penny. Would recommend. 😀",5,2017,06,10
119,Friends christening ,"Visited this hotel/yacht for a close friends christening of their newly born sun and had always wanted to stay here.
The place as you walk in is simply stunning and just oozes pure luxury which gave the feel of what's missing in today's age.
The food that was put on was very tasty along with the exceptional service! 

Went to the bar that had a jazz musician playing who was very good as had a full crowd chilling and enjoying the sounds.

Have booked a night here with the wife as it's very romantic.

",5,2017,06,09
119,Amazing stay on the Sunborn Yacht,We stayed in an executive room with a river view which was absolutely amazing! The room was beautiful and had a very comfy bed. The balcony was superb and offered wonderful views across the dock. The executive room includes breakfast which had a plentiful choice catering for all appetites.,5,2017,06,09
119,Hotel with a difference,"We recently stayed at the Sunborn Yacht Hotel, the reception area is impressive, the room was very clean and spacious enough, the let down was the carpet - it was stained very badly, I really don't think they should let guests stay in rooms with such an obvious default, I didn't make a fuss but reported it quietly on departure, reception said sorry, but  surely closing one room for 24 hours would resolve the issue? It was a slight let down.
We ate in the restaurant on board, the food and service were excellent, but very pricey.
Also the menu offers mainly fish dishes.
We booked a room for 3 people, when we got to our room there was no bedding for the extra bed, we requested it and they came and made the bed up while we explored on shore!
When we got back to change we realised we had no third Towel, shower gel, dressing gown, slippers, and even down to cup, tea and biscuit! So much for paying extra for the three of us, we rang reception a couple of times and the items were brought to our room, it was a little annoying as after requesting the bedding you would of thought someone would of made sure that the room had been set for 3 guests.  
Overall we enjoyed our stay, but with a few improvements it could have been better.",4,2017,06,08
119,Over piced too far out from city centre,"The Sunborn is over priced both for accommodation and food/drink ,the location is remote from the city centre with transport being either the D.L.R and underground which is not practical if the weather is poor as the D.L.R station is 500 metres from hotel with walking there the only option, if you go by taxi again it is a 150 metre walk with a black cab costing in excess of 40 pounds single journey ,private hire 30+,we spent in excess of 200 on taxis in a 2 day stay. The hotel room was standard when we had paid for better with a dirty carpet ,heating that did not work and only warm hot water, I would rec looking for a hotel nearer the city",3,2017,06,08
119,Birthday getaway,''This hotel was pleasantly surprising.  The room was beautiful and peaceful. The bed was very comfortable I wish I could take it home. The staff are friendly and really try to give you a good experience. The breakfast buffet was full of variety. I like the fact that the o2 is opposite  so food or entertainment is close by as long as you travel on the cable carts. Would recommend staying here.,4,2017,06,07
119,Poor service,"I love the concept of a yacht on the Thames and have visited the Sunborn a few times.

My recent visit was just for lunch.  Sadly the service was very slow, and the quality of food and drinks was poor.  

This facility could be amazing, but they need to improve their standards and service.",2,2017,06,07
119,Avoid this hotel - beyond appalling,"Marketed as a super yacht the hotel really appeals to those looking for something a little different.
Think of a yacht and where does your mind take you....elegance, style, luxury? If that is the case, pardon the pun, but give this hotel a very wide berth!
We stayed in a king room with river views and on first inspection it really looked the part.
Then when you scratch the surface like aging paint disguising damp the veneer peels away to leave a grubby underbelly.

Issue 1 -lovely to have a tablet in the room....if it worked and wasn't in a perpetual state of charging that might be beneficial.

Issue 2 - 24 hr room service, excellent, but you really need a menu.

Issue 3 - the menu is pathetic for room service, sandwiches in a limited choice and pizza....as limited.

Issue 4 - try and order room service! Just getting through and someone picking up the phone is a challenge.

We persevered as hungry....2 sandwiches, not difficult as we opted for the same filling. Advised 10-15 minutes.

Phone call 1 - from reception, apologies there is  a delay as kitchen busy, it'll be another 10 minutes. 35 minutes later, we have to call again as sandwiches remain elusive.

Met with an apology, the room service will be complimentary. Another 15 minutes then another call.....they'll be 5 minutes and with us....definitely.

20 minutes passes...hungry has gone into hangry. Phillip the night manager has been lied to by the kitchen! This the the night duty manager blaming colleagues talking zero ownership. I'm then lied to, it was not him who called the room twice advising of the delays. How strange, same name same voice (gentle accent so distinguishable).

I'm asking what they intend to do about this frankly appalling service.....no answer. It's not really their fault they are busy!

I draw the attention to the fact we've ordered 2 sandwiches and have been waiting in total an hour and a half. The reply again is nothing they can do, they are busy.

Folks this is apparently a 4 star hotel! I've had better customer service at a serviced lavatory!

Don't believe the hype, avoid this it is low standard and the staff (night duty manager) is unable to deal with complaints. The lack of genuine empathy or ownership was utterly disgusting for someone in hospitality.

There are ample hotels in the area, save yourself the pain of staying here. Is have given it zero points it's that bad plus the beds are fitted with thin mattresses, a wonderful nights sleep...not.",1,2017,06,06
119,"Umm , interesting?","Well , lets start with the feelgood factor, who wants to stay in a boring dull mid priced hotel when you can spend a night on a super yacht?

The Sunborn delivers on kerb appeal, the yacht looks fantastic moored in the old Albert dock. Getting there is easy as well , a short walk from the nearest DLR station and the Emirates airway , linking you to the O2 in a few minutes, and yet this feels a million miles away , peace quiet and no crowds.

Our room was excellent, large and airy, with a balcony overlooking the water. The room has everything you could want for a very comfy nights stay , including bath robes and slippers. A little more attention to detail in the bathroom and the room would be perfect.

The bar is a cool place to hang out , and overall this yacht beats and mid price hotel hands down.

However one area that needs attention, the service in the bar. Slow slow no quick slow,
And a real hassle to order food late at night ..... a real sham.

Overall , a really cool place to stay with great transport links, just find somewhere else to eat !",4,2017,06,05
119,Mediocre at best,"This hotel markets itself as a luxurious yacht hotel but it really is no different from any other hotel other than the fact that it is located in an old ship.  Luxurious it is not.  Sofa bed for by son was hard and uncomfortable.  No sheets, had to ask for it and they brought it over and handed it over at the door.  I am used to 4+ star hotels actually making up that extra bed!  Cover for the sofa bed was vastly inadequate.  Amenities are average and so is service and customer care.  We satisfied our curiosity but wont' be back.   I suppose it's good for wedding photos but there are better hotels if one is looking for luxury. ",3,2017,06,05
119,Good looking location but ultimately disappoints,"If you run a hotel which is based on a yacht, you might be tempted to think that the novelty alone will be enough to make your property a success.

I suspect this is the trap that the owners of Sunborn have fallen into.

Yes this is a cool hotel - you can stay in a real cabin and have a drink on a real deck, without actually leaving the shore. On a hot summer's day this place really comes into its own, visually.

Unfortunately they let themselves down with the oldest trap in hospitality - mediocre service. This is a hotel which on a busy hot day thinks that staffing the bar with one person is a good idea. As it happens, a barman so incompetent that in the three hours I spent there I saw him smash glasses and spill drinks on three separate occasions. 

There were no drinks menus anywhere to be found. Asking for one led to ultimate disappointment because the staff repeatedly forgot. As I watched one of the hapless waiters carry a plate of seriously overpriced food out to an outside table, dropping french fries off the plate as he walked, I realised that asking again was just a waste of time. Best to stick to prosecco (at an eye-watering £40 a bottle). 

If you are lucky enough to get served at the bar, you might be forgiven for attempting to pay the person who served you your drinks. Bizarrely at this hotel, this would be an error. Payment is made to a completely separate person whose sole job is to handle payments. So having waited an excessive amount of time just to get the drinks, you then have to start the wait all over again in order to pay. I can't help thinking it would be far more productive to get this second person also serving drinks and have them both take payments at the same time. Contactless would also speed the whole process up (it's not that new any more, guys). 

It's a shame - the Sunborn should be a great destination but I doubt they get much repeat business.",3,2017,06,04
119,Lovely view,"We stayed on board the Suborn for two nights,Breakfast was wonderful,  lovely rooms very clean, bathrooms excellent, staff very polite and helpful. The view at night from the deck was delightful.
Would highly recommend. Only problem it was far out from the City but at least could relax",5,2017,06,03
119,A fabulous experience with the 02 a stones throw away,"We booked into the Sunborn yatch May 2017 as were seeing Kiss at the 02, what a fabulous location. 
Upon entry we were greeted by a very friendly team and were promptly booked into our waterside 4th floor executive suite with balcony. The room was extremely clean and the décor followed the theme.
Being a short walk to the Emirates chair lift which disembarks just outside the 02, the location was perfect, the ExCel London is next door.
We had a three course meal which could only be described as Michelin star quality, compliments to the Chef and waiting team. The starters were fabulous, the steak cooked to perfection and deserts superb. Complimented by a fabulous wine list.
All in all a wonderful experience made possible by a great team. Well done to all.",5,2017,06,02
119,Christening day 27.05.2017,"I attended a Christening party in Ball room, with excellent food, very helpful staff and amazing decor. Really beautiful place to spend lovely time with family and friends. You can forget the views. I recommend this beautiful place.

119,Beautiful Yacht Hotel,Beautiful staircase and foyer area along with really good sized rooms. A thank you to Borja our waiter at the restaurant. A perfect visit all round. Will definitely be returning for a longer stay - this time during a warmer time of year!,5,2017,05,31
119,A dfferent experience,"Booked this for a birthday celebration. We had a room with a view and outside terrace.  However there was just enough room for 2 seats when you sat down you could not see anything.  A little disappointing.  Service in the bar was hit and miss.  We had to ask twice for the bottle of Prosecco, which we had paid for in advance, to be brought to our seats a few yards away.  Reception staff were very friendly and helpful.  Views across the City were amazing and you do get a different perspective being on the water. There are some restaurants in the immediate vicinity however we chose to  eat in Canary Wharf which was £15 taxi ride for 2.5 miles!! The Emirates Cable Car is a short walk which takes you over to the 02 arena where you can also catch the the water taxi.  The only 5* part of the stay would be the excellent reception staff.",3,2017,05,31
119,Great location for visiting the Excel,"Reception was inviting, staff helpful.
 Happy with our room but there was some engine/mechanical noise that did make you feel you were next to a clothes drier, we were on the 1st floor...could be annoying if someone finds it hard to get to sleep, we didnt have any problem sleeping! Beds very comfortable .
Loved the riverside vie w.
Unable to get a meal at the restaurant because we didnt book early enough. We stayed 2 nights didnt book because we were not sure what time we would return each night. We were attending the MCM comic con at Excel.
We were able to get bar snacks and drinks and were well looked after by Ines. Prices were on the expensive side but we enjoyed the view and live entertainment on Saturday night.
Would definitley stay again",4,2017,05,30
119,Amazing Hotel!,"What a beautiful place! Check in was friendly and welcoming and, as we were early, our bags were stored and then delivered to our room before we got back.
The room was spotless and spacious. The balcony was a lovely view and a lovely breeze on a very hot day!
Breakfast was delicious.
Overall the views were amazing and I had. Great time. Staff were helpful with every request. Would love to visit again!",5,2017,05,30
119,Boyfriends Birthday ,"So I booked this luxury 5* hotel as a one off treat for my boyfriends Birthday. He had always wanted to stay here so this was a great opportunity. Check in was fine, really friendly woman called Andrea checked us in, we were early and our room wasn't ready so we went to sit out on deck and get a drink...
Service was awful! Sat outside all the waitresses on deck walked past, for about 20mins, eventually one asked us if we wanted a drink, we ordered, a further 15mins it took for them to return with our drinks! We ordered a G&T and vodka and lemonade so not even a cocktail that needed making!

Anyway our room was ready and was absolutely perfect. Clean, big and more importantly sound proof as there was an event going on outside that was loud!!

Later that evening we went back to the bar for a drink after dinner...
The service was again incredibly poor! We went to the bar to order in the end as we waited 15/20mins to be served. I wouldn't mind but there were 2 waitresses and about 8 guests in the bar! 

Also a little disappointed as I mentioned it being my boyfriends Birthday and there were no little extras. After paying so much for a room, I'd rather hoped they'd have a chocolate on the pillow or a birthday card!

The rooms and check in staff were 5* 
Service was the let down!!! A few tweaks and it could be amazing!

119,Could be fantastic,"Came here for a family trip to London. Room was excellent with close amenities. Staff were always polite & helpful. However the place always seems to be a bit understaffed. At breakfast we always found empty trays for cooked breakfast & had to wait a while for them to be refilled. We also went to the bar in the early evening & had to wait 10-15mins before our order was taken & another 10-15mins before we got it.
It's a real shame because this could so easily be a 5 star review & all the staff we did talk to were excellent & working hard, there just didn't seem to be quite enough of them. ",4,2017,05,28
119,Weekend trip to London ,"We stayed for 1 night in an executive room with river view.  The room was clean with a large, very comfy bed, but the decor is tired (circa 1985) and the balcony is enclosed so that when you sit on the chairs you can't really see anything except sky!

The meal we had in the restaurant was superb and the chef even came out so we could say thank you to him.  

I would definitely stay on the sunborn again as it is very comfortable, the staff and friendly and helpful and it is good location for getting to central London (we used über which cost about £15) You can park in the excel carpark which is really close for £20 for 24 hours",4,2017,05,28
119,Lots of pluses but some disappointments this time.,"There is no getting away from the fact that this is a glamourous looking hotel...To return to your ""yacht"" each night is rather cool.  The cabins are spacious, we had one with a balcony this time but this means you have laminate flooring rather than carpet.  The disadvantage of this is neighbours in stiletto heels!  Overall though, being towards the prow, we had a nice quiet stay.  If you want a ""lay-in"" though, there are quieter places than being directly under the City Airport flight path!
Royal Dock is attractive and the Hotel is close to other restaurants, bars and cafes, including two supermarkets, but also far enough away from all the hubbub of London.  But Hotel guests MUST be dissuaded from throwing cigarette butts into the dock.  It looks unpleasant to other guests and is not nice for the local swimming club users. 
Big negative...the wifi was not working as it should and to faff around for the five days we were there, organising delivery of passwords each day was a great inconvenience.  Surprising that such a large concern couldnt get their internet service sorted out over a whole week!  Staff were pleasant but there was a lack of communication between different managers to resolve our particulars issues.  Housekeeping were particularly helpful and friendly.
My companion is registered disabled and it was not until our last night there that we discovered there are three disabled parking spaces adjacent to the Hotel!  According to the Thursday daytime manageress, this information is on the Hotel website, but not on their Booking.com profile.  But on our final morning, retrieving our vehicle was made very awkward by Excel security having basically blocked the parking spaces in!  If any of the vehicles parked in these spaces had been driven by the disabled party themselves, I dont know how they would have got on.  
To conclude, a very pleasant stay but improvements need to be made.",4,2017,05,27
119,Good experience ,"Brought my partner here for a surprise birthday, had a good journey here, not hard to find, on arrival we parked around the corner for £15 for 24 hours which was good. Quick check in and found our room, we had a executive room with river view and balcony, room was an ok size, clean and tidy with a plate of white chocs on the table, and a lovely hand written welcome which was a lovely touch.. tea, coffe amenities, room phone and iPad didn't work so went to reception to sort out.we had a lovely balcony view, room had air con so that was a bonus on a hot hot day.We unpacked and explored the area. We received complementary drinks of champs but were not nice at all, we then tried a cocktail which was awful and i did mention this to a waiter. Wonderful views from the deck at night. Morning we had breakfast which was nice, full english and continental, good tea and coffees were served, check out is 11am. Good experience and we actually didn't mind the planes that fly into city airport. Would definitely recommend this to try.",4,2017,05,27
119,A fantastic stay at sunborn,From the moment we stepped on board the Sunborn we were greeted with a very warm welcome.Andrea the manager made us feel very much welcome and a valued guest.The rooms were spacious with everything we needed the in room Sony tablet was very useful for hotel and outside information.The restaurant had a delicious menu served by lovely staff.The bar area was very relaxing with a great choice of beverages.We had a fantastic time and a great choice for my wife's birthday,5,2017,05,27
119,Celebration trip ,"Just finished a two night stay at this lovely hotel,it's full of sophisticated charm and despite negative reviews re how far out of the city the yacht is situated , we found this an unexpected bonus.The trip on the cable car to the O2 and the onward boat was fabulous,we learned all about the brilliance of Uber and we had a lovely haven with beautiful views from the yacht to return to,dinner in the hotel restaurant was lovely too.

Thank you team Sunborn ",5,2017,05,27
119,Great hotel,"Purchased as a deal on 'secret escapes' (had deals everywhere online). Two nights stay with breakfast and three course evening meal.
LOCATION is not great for central London. If you want to grab a single tube to central London this is not the hotel for you. It's a 15 minute walk to the Dockland Light Railway then a 10 minute journey to a tube station. After that, it's standard tube stuff - 10 to 20 minutes to be somewhere central for shopping, sight seeing or shows. We went for a show in the West End and left more than an hour before the start time. We missed the start. Allowing for waiting for the DLR and tube changes it took much, much longer than we wanted and arrived tired and hot. That's not the hotels fault but worth noting for anyone wanting to know about staying there.
FOOD was great. Breakfast had full English and continental offerings and the offering was of very high standard. The evening meal was also very good. We ate starters, mains and desert and the food and service was again of a high standard.
ACCOMMODATION was great. We had an executive river view room. The on-suite was shower only and was modern and clean. The room was compact (you are on a boat) but just the right size for our needs - a large double bed, a sofa and a good size TV. Just enough room to relax and move around. The balcony overlooking the Thames was small - the two seats only just fit on the balcony and when sitting, you cannot see over the side to enjoy the view. The balcony is a nice addition and I did enjoy a drink out there at sunset.
The rest of the hotel is well maintained and modern. The views of the river, the Docklands etc are all very pleasant. The staff were helpful and attentive. Overall, I would recommend the hotel with the one warning about location I have already outlined.",4,2017,05,26
119,Amazing Visit and perfect place to celebrate a milestone,"We stayed onboard Sunborn Yatch for a long weekend to celebrate 10 years since we met. This was the perfect surroundings for such an occasion. The rooms where furnished excellently and fitted in with the quality of the hotel as a whole. This was not the biggest selling point of the hotel, this was the staff. Each and every member of staff was happy to help and attentive. We were invited up to the Sky Lounge on the first night for drinks this really made the weekend. The personal touches where the staff went the extra mile really was the selling point of this weekend.",5,2017,05,26
119,Exceptional,We stayed here with friends in April. the yacht is a stunning place to stay. The rooms were lovely and spacious and very comfortable and ideal place to stay to visit London as transport links are very close by,5,2017,05,25
119,Birthday Trip,"I booked this hotel online for my Wife's birthday, I had walked passed this place whilst on a trip to the excel centre and was immediately taken back by its luxury look.

Upon arrival to London we took the river boat up the Thames to North Greenwich then jumped on the cable car, whilst on our journey we noticed how industrial the are is. It was disappointing to see as the pictures online looked great. However, when we got off the cable car it was as if we were transported to a completely different area of London. The area was well developed and could certainly be described as a hidden gem.

We arrived nice and early to take full advantage of our executive room, the weather was good so after check in we went to the bar for a drink and to sit in the sun. The bar prices were reasonable, I had a bottle of cider which was around the £5 mark. Pretty standard for central London. 

The room itself was an adequate size, it featured a small shower room with built in toilet, kingsize bed, fridge and sofa area. The Tea and Coffee facilities were the best I have seen in a hotel with an espresso coffee machine available with multiple free pods. 

The only disappointing thing about the stay was the balcony, although a decent size the sides were high and infilled meaning your view was obstructed when sat down. It was a shame as I had booked this room for the balcony and barely ended up using it!

My only other comment is to be aware of the location, it is at the end of the runway for London City Airport. The noise did not bother us and it was good to stand and watch the planes come passed very low. It appeared flights stopped between 9pm and 6.30am. 

Overall - A good story to say we have been, but wouldn't return.",4,2017,05,25
119,Generous xmas gift ,We visited London in may 17 and stayed on the sun born yacht and I must say it was very impressive the staff were really nice and the generous size spotless well equipped room with balcony was lovely it's so easy to get to and just far enough from the busy city with easy quick options to get there where the yacht is berthed the docks are nice with bars shops and restaurants We were surprised that most people we spoke to had never heard of it as it is different and a lovely accommodation well worth it ,5,2017,05,25
119,"Attending an exhibition in the Excel centre, it could not be nearer.","Bad bits: room a bit tired, wear on the sofa, scratches on the floor. Good bits: service, however was faultless. Booking a breeze, ALL staff brilliant. Excellent food (a bit expensive, but what did you expect?). View across the docks was fabulous, especially in the evening. Room was HUGE. Could have had a party in it. Got a reasonable deal and overall very impressed. Will stay again.",4,2017,05,24
119,A Unique Event Experience,"A unique venue with a lovely ambiance.  Food amazing.  Staff excellent, especially Romao Catrapona, Meetings and Events Executive, who couldn't do enough for you to ensure your experience was a good one.  The only thing I think could be improved is the speed of getting things done (i.e refreshments), but other than that extremely happy and a wonderful venue/experience.  I have used this venue twice for 2 very different events - worked well for both.",5,2017,05,24
119,Lovely time,"I got intrigued by this yacht hotel so I decided to stay overnight during my recent birthday. 
Check in went smoothly, the reception staff were helpful and friendly. I booked two family rooms. The mirrored wall across the bed was nice, the coffee machine was a delight for coffee lovers like me. You'll feel that you are in a yacht or even ship waiting to cruise the Med! Although my request of a water facing rooms were not granted,I still enjoyed my stay. It's a bit pricey and room prices were constantly changing so better book it when the price is ok rather than delaying it. Overall, I had a lovely time. I would love to come back. ",5,2017,05,23
119,Great location for Excel,"Stayed recently whilst attending an exhibition at Excel. Really unusual hotel based around a yacht, it is floating! The rooms are extremely spacious and mine enjoyed a fabulous balcony with views up and down the Thames.",4,2017,05,23
119,Fantastic cocktails,"Great customer service. We stayed in the executive room which was big enough to hold a queen size bed and double sofa. It was comfortable and roomy. Wardrobes/ furniture was lacquered wood. I found a bit dated but the room was still nice with a balcony to a great view of the docks.breakfast was a buffet with a good choice .
We had a free cocktail as part of the deal we choose which was fantastic and have a massage or facial. Really good.",4,2017,05,23
119,A different hotel experience in London,"I booked to stay on the Sunborn for my fiance's birthday for one Saturday night. I found a good deal online for a river view room.

The hotel is lovely, a great experience staying on a yacht instead of a standard hotel.

Staff and friendly, rooms are a great size with very comfy beds and a lovely view.

Only downside was the service in the bar, part of our order was forgotten. When asking another member of staff to see if they can find out what happened to it will still didn't receive it.

When leaving the bar I wanted to make sure this wasn't on the bill and it turns out our table was that forgotten about that they hadn't even run our order through the till.
This is probably just a slip of the mind but it did bring the experience down a little.

Breakfast was lovely with views of the Thames and the O2.
Great hotel for something a little different in London.",5,2017,05,23
119,"If you can, CANCEL now!","Booked direct from website the 'romantic package' for my partners birthday. 

Check in was quick and easy however they fail to tell you upon booking that's its mandatory they charge £40 to your card and refund this later at check out should you not use it at the bar or restaurant. We spent more than this but reading recent reviews .... dont expect this back.

Room was nice, as expected from reviews and photos, bathroom was small but inkeeping with the yacht feel. Included in the package were 'rose petals and a selection tray of chocolates' (£45). The fake Rose petals can be purchased at 99p from ebay with a selection of the same 4 small chocolate truffles! 

Bar outside on the deck is nice, lack of tables and chairs and perhaps not set up for summer yet as different to photos. We went to 3 different tables after going to the bar each time to order drinks (no waiter service). Each time we sat on a dirty table full of empty glasses and rubbish. This was cleared after time, staff are not on the ball. 

We had a 3 course meal at the Restaurant booked, i rang ahead to request a table by the window which was given, so credit where its due. The package included 2 glasses of champagne which had to be asked for, the waiter had to then go and double check! Hardly romantic! 

The crab for starter was cold and was quite possibly the smelliest ive ever received (im a massive seafood fan but this really put me off, nonetheless went ahead to eat it. Halibut was dry and not enjoyable. Ham hock was tasteless, fillet steak was requested rare when we enquired we were told it was cooked medium and walked away. Cheesecake was soggy. Wine was cheap tasting and undrinkable. Atmosphere was dull, decor needs a refurb. Apart from the view there was nothing romantic about this.

Had a gin downstairs at the bar, gin menu was very enjoyable and would recommend this. Went to the room feeling disappointed with the evening. My partner woke up in the middle of the night with the sweats, tried to turn the air con down and this was stuck on 24 (as I've now found out others have mentioned so this clearly hasn't been fixed). We didn't ring reception as it was the middle of the night!

Finally got to sleep and the FIRE ALARM went off at 8am! There was no call from reception to say this was a false alarm, we ended up looking outside the front door to see what wad going on.

Went for breakfast which was nice buffet style, partner struggled to eat as didn't feel great. Went back to the room where he was as white as a sheet and ended up spending the next few hours being sick from which we are certain was food poisoning (only ate at the hotel apart from cereal breakfast the day of booking). 

WE COULDN'T WAIT TO LEAVE!

if you want to spend hundreds of pounds for no sleep, overpriced wine, plastic rose petals and food poisoning this is your place! CANCEL IF YOU CAN!

119,Anniversary stay,"We booked the Sunborn to celebrate our wedding anniversary and it exceeded all our expectations. The staff in reception were so nice and friendly. We were given our room keys and entered our room which was on the 2nd deck. My husband surprised me with towel swans, rose petals on teh bed, amazing truffles and a botlle of bubbly in the cooler. What a perfect start! We then went to the bar to enjoy a cocktail before going to the restaurant for our dinner. The views duting the evening are just breathtaking. Our dinner was just perfect, the food and the service are second to none. Breakfast next morning was on a buffet with plenty of choices and well cooked. A memorable stay for a special occasion, highly recommended",5,2017,05,18
119,Lovely Hotel on the Dock,"Recently had a wonderful stay at the Sunborn Yacht Hotel London. On arrival check in was smooth and efficient. Staff were informative and attentive. Dined in the hotel and the Lands End Restaurant which was very busy but managed to get a table without booking. The staff were helpful and understanding to allergies and dietary requirements. They were service oriented and responsive. 

The room was clean, tidy, and spacious with a view of the dock and housekeeping had straightened the room, replenished toiletries etc. The Location was convenient – close to the Royal Victoria and City Airport DLR. Hop on the DLR to Canary Wharf or Stratford for some shopping and dining out. Also the Emirates cable car that can take you over to the O2 in North Greenwich. A short walk along the dock also takes you to local restaurants. Overall a convenient and pleasant stay at the hotel.",5,2017,05,18
119,All quiet and calm aboard the Sunborn Yacht,"The Sunborn Yacht is a luxury hotel with a unique position in Victoria dock. We had dinner in the Land's End Restaurant, with views towards the Dome, Docklands and cable car, creating a very attractive cityskape.  We were very impressed with the high quality service at dinner. Peter the waiter, had been prepared for a dietary intolerance to milk and he had already spoken with the chef and come up with wonderful alternatives. We thought this was an exceptionally good service. The food was excellent and good value. The quality of the fittings and furnishings aboard Sunborn make it a genuine luxury yacht, with the advantage that you don't get seasick and there is no engine noise!  We will return.",5,2017,05,18
119,"Fantastic food, but I'm not sure that's enough for the price ","A few months back I wrote a review about this hotel that was very critical. It was also very unusual because at the time I had not yet had the chance to stay at the hotel, for reasons my earlier review made clear. 

Following that review being published on this website, a representative of the hotel did make contact with me in an effort to address the concerns I had raised and to try to make arrangements for my daughter and I to visit the hotel as we had previously hoped to. 

So I must give credit where it is due, and in this case it is due. The hotel did respond to my concerns and criticism.

Those efforts were initially clumsy as they wanted me to pay again for the stay which I felt I had paid for, but that curious idea was dealt with and a visit to the hotel was arranged. 

As a result, I think it is very fair to provide a review of that visit as there is much to be complimented on about this hotel. 

Our trip to the hotel was notable because it took us past a number of other hotels that are in the immediate area of which there are many as the Excel Centre is right beside this hotel. These hotels include an Ibis and a Crowne Plaza, chains that I know very well. As such I'm aware of the standards offered by these hotels as well as their cost. These hotels and others in the area must obviously be considered to be competition for the Sunborn, at least in terms of location. I will return to this point at the end. 

On our arrival at the Sunborn we waited at the reception desk while all 3 staff on duty were occupied with another hotel guest who was engaged in a very protracted (as it turned out) and very angry (as it was very evident) dispute with the staff about being overcharged very considerable amounts as they were trying to check out.

I mention this other guest's dispute. not to give credence to the other guest's position about their bill, but only to make note of how it was being dealt with. The hotel staff were not conciliatory or calming. I didn't get the impression that repeat custom was a concern, however I don't know what else may have already gone on so I shouldn't comment further about what we witnessed. 

However what I can comment on is the fact that we were left standing unattended for a very long time while 2 staff members argued with the other guest and a 3rd staff member stood by and watched the argument. I thought this to be an odd approach as we were required to stand and watch as well - apparently invisible to those who might have checked us in quickly so that we didn't need to have our visit start so negatively. 

Once we were checked in we went off to our room and got the chance to experience the visual impact of the hotel's decor - and it makes quite an impact! 

This ship is adorned!  It's glitzy and it's bright, which is just as it's portrayed on the website, so it certainly doesn't disappoint for gilded finishes and bright polished surfaces. 

And the room we had was surprisingly large!  The separate sitting area leading to the balcony was unexpected and very nice. There is lots of room for luggage and moving around, although less storage space than might be expected. However we were staying only one night so that was not a problem. It might be for a longer stay though. 

The bathroom was compact as would be expected on a ship, but the small size of the bathroom didn't need to be matched by the teeny tiny and skimpy toiletries, which might be from the very good label that was promised on the website, but the bottles are so tiny it might be easy to miss that fact.

I know this last comment may come off as a cheap dig. But this hotel is not itself ""cheap digs"" . It's an expensive hotel. It should not skimp on the details. 

As mentioned, the hotel rooms are big - and impressively so - and the level of polish and finish seen elsewhere continued into our room. But as polished and shiny as the surfaces are, the rooms are curiously stripped bare. The impression that is left is that a once beautifully dressed and bejeweled glamorous woman has been stripped bare and given a modest, but good quality, dress to wear instead. It's as if the grand party that the ship was built for ended a while ago. Or perhaps it never really happened. 

This same feeling continued as we explored the ship on our way to dinner. My daughter is a keen hotel explorer and I'm happy to explore with her. To be fair I had told her there weren't a lot of places open to exploring as other than meeting rooms similar to those in most small hotels and some lounge areas there isn't much to see. But that is what I expected.  For a kid spending a night on a boat I think my daughter hoped for more. 

What we did find was a lot of furniture in the public areas, which is an odd comment I know. But what is remarkable about the furniture is that it is so unremarkable. It's as if they ran out of money after gilding and veneering all the surfaces. It makes for a very strange and jarring contrast. 

However while cost might have been cut in the furniture budget, this did not continue in the dining menu. And in relation to the food and the service in the dining room my praise is effusive and enthusiastic! 

Both of our dinners were delicious and the service was excellent. My daughter received lovely special attention and she was offered an imaginative and thoughtful selection of mock - tails which I think every young teen can enjoy. 

The food menu was diverse without seeming to be self indulgent on the part of the chef.  The side dishes were both traditional and creative in choice. And every dish was faultless. I can't remember when I have had a better dinner while also enjoying watching my daughter also have an excellent and healthy (that is non - beige) meal as well. 

My compliments to the chef indeed. 

We returned to our ""quarters"" and enjoyed a good night of sleep, which I comment on as the beds are not generous in size and the mattresses appear to be unusually thin.  But they work! 

Breakfast the next morning was similarly impressive with a buffet style breakfast offered which was well stocked with traditional breakfast items. The service in the dining room was again excellent. 

As there aren't a lot of diversions on the boat we headed on our way fairly soon after breakfast and as we walked away from the Sunborn and walked past the Ibis hotel next door I noticed that the daily rate for the hotel next door was less than £100. 

Seeing this made me wonder how much the novelty of a yacht hotel is worth as there is not really anything else about the Sunborn that made it remarkable or worth a return visit, which is a shame. I don't regret for a moment that we had the little adventure that we hoped for. And the food was a stand out. 

But I wish the whole experience had been a bit more remarkable. Or at least remarkable for other reasons. 

I read that the Sunborn had to be towed into place as it doesn't have any engines, so it's really a bit of a faux yacht in some respects. I hope it doesn't turn out to be a faux hotel as well and that it does not end up being towed away at some point when it can no longer compete with its less costly and equally comfortable albeit less quirky and unique local competition. That would also be a shame. 

So all in all it was an interesting visit. But I don't think we'll be back soon. ",3,2017,05,17

119,pure 1st class!,"arrived at the hotel after a shirt walk from the Royal Victoria tube station and we were hit immediately with the ""wow"" factor! the yacht is so impressive (even when the glorious English weather let us down - raining).

My boyfriend and i stayed for our 1 year anniversary and we were welcomed with a complimentary chocolate selection and lovely note in our room which was a truly lovely touch. The room was clean and spacious and the bed was sooooo comfortable! we also booked dinner in the restaurant and this was absolutely superb! Our waiter was just wonderful. so professional, friendly and extremely attentive. i'm sorry i didn't get his name because he really needs to be complimented on his service.

Great views over Canary Wharf and minutes from City airport which helped immensely for my flight to and from Zurich. But i can truly say i have found a little gem! Food is also well presented and well delivered by a polite and professional team in the restaurant. Raul the restaurant manager has done a great job by assembling a team which really represents what a place like the Sunborn is all about. A shout out to Mariana who served our table impeccably and impressed two of my clients. Thank you again for helping me create a lasting impression.,5,2017,05,15
119,Thank you,"Everything was great from start to finish. The yacht looks amazing from outside and your jaw drops when you enter reception and you see the staircase with the chandelier. Our room was very spacious with great shower and everything you need. Huge bed, coffee machine, free wi-fi, even Molton Brown toiletries. Breakfast was also great with a lot of choices. Something definitely worth mentioning and a credit to the Sunborn is the people who work there, always smiling and seem to be very happy working there. Thank you for a great stay.",5,2017,05,15
119,Great start to a two show theatre trip!,"I have stayed on the sunborn yacht on two occasions.The rooms are excellent, everything you need and very comfortable beds.My only complaint would be that the hot food at breakfast wasn't that hot! I did mention this when checking out.",4,2017,05,15
119,What a great place,"So, booked in advance and got a great deal. This place is special and just a little bit swanky. The reception and check in were great and the room amazing. I thought the room would be small being on a yacht but it was very spacious with a superking bed and a sofa. Didn't take the offer of upgrade to a balcony room as at a conference at Excel and not in the room too much.
Had a couple of drinks in the bar. The view from the bar at the back of the yacht is great - looks towards the Emirates Sky Line (you MUST do that!) and the City. A little pricey but worth it (£5 for a small Peroni).",5,2017,05,14
119,Best Impressions!,"I visited the Sunborn Yacht for a couple of days due to a business trip in London and I admit that I have the best impressions. It is something different compared to other hotels. Spacious room, stunning view, fantastic food snd generally great facilities with friendly staff. I highly recommend to everyone.",5,2017,05,14
119,Good for ExCel,"This hotel is the one located closest to ExCel's west entrance although there are some other quite nearby. Reception is in 3rd floor and you need to use an elevator to step into ship, which is a bit strange. Room is good, wlan is bad. Nice shower in rather small bathroom. Breakfast is quite modest, I recommend to have it on ExCel.",3,2017,05,14
119,Sunborn,"I was trying to find something different to book for my hubby's birthday and the Sunborn ticked all the boxes. Our room was very clean and so spacious you could fit two more people in there. Comfortable king size bed, tea and coffee and powerful shower. I had booked a table in the restaurant and I wanted our dinner to be the highlight of our stay as we don't eat out much. It was amazing, the food was divine and the service was so attentive, everything is high quality. Definitely worth every penny spent, I recommend to everyone looking somewhere different to stay.",5,2017,05,14
119,Perfect Stay,"This was our second visit to the Sunborn London and it even surpassed the first.  All the hotel staff were the best that we have encountered and made us feel very special.  The reception staff were extremely efficient and helpful.  We were spoilt with little extras like chocolates delivered to our room and a complimentary bottle of wine which was a lovely surprise.  The location was great with the cable cars so close which enabled us to then pick up the Clipper Boat at North Greenwich.  We had a fantastic stay and we would highly recommend the Sunborn Yacht Hotel as a great place to stay, loved it.",5,2017,05,14
119,Simply amazing,"I can highly recommend Sunborn hotel. We were staying there last weekend.
The price for a hotel room with breakfast is great and worth every penny. The hotel has stunning decor  I was really impressed with it. From the moment you enter the place everyone is extremely friendly, professional and helpful. 
Room we had was really lovely with very comfortable bed. We had s breakfast in the beautiful restaurant and we came across very friendly and attetive staff members ( which always make the stay so much better when your waiter/ waitess is smiley , hepful and professional!)
The hotel is a Yaht which makes views so much better !
Access to public transport is very easy to! Which was very important for us.
I will definitely go back to that stunning place .",5,2017,05,13
119,Weekend Staycation,"Booked the hotel as it sounds and look different from any other london hotels and we made the right decision. Very nice and clean rooms, friendly and accommodating staffs, we immensely enjoyed our anniversary weekend! Will definitely be back when our parents visit. Our daughter enjoyed her own ""bed"" too. 
",5,2017,05,13
119,Fantastic!,"I attended the celebration of my friend’s daughter christening last Saturday at Sunborn Yacht. Everything was wonderful. Uniquely decorated venue, welcoming with champagne, fabulous lunch and dessert, friendly staff and amazing view. I look forward to visit the Sunborn again for a stay.",5,2017,05,13
119,Amazing,Booked sunborn for one night stay & was really excited as it was for my birthday & something totally different. We arrived early than our check in time the staff was very welcoming. When we gave our surname they wished me a happy birthday & talked to our son at being the captain of the ship which made him smile. We was already impressed with the surroundings & staff. We decided to go out & about so they took our baggage. When we arrived back i did not expect what happened next we were taken to our room & it was WOW they had upgraded us. I could not fault anything & I wished we could have stayed another night. Thanks to all the staff at sunborn for the experience & making it another memory. ,5,2017,05,12
119,Great dining and service,"We didn't stay at the Sunborn but attended a lunch party after the christening of our friend's daughter. The yacht is beautiful and it really makes for an exceptional place to stay or for any other type of occasion, with a stunning view of the Wharf. The staff was great; warm, welcoming, and very accommodating. The food was fantastic! Especially the desserts. Overall a very good experience.",5,2017,05,12
119,Lack of care,"The hotel itself is lovely, lobby is overwhelming and views are really nice, great location if you are going to the 02 arena, however staff are rude and when i tried to voice my opinions and issues on checkout the manager would not even speak to me, we wanted to enjoy a drink in the bar before we headed to the drake concert only to find all the seats reserverd, on check in at 3 we also tried to book a table in the restaraunt only to be told they are fully booked, check in time was at 3 and we were one of the first in the que, fully booked already...... before checkin out  a cleaner walked in on me and my partner whilst we were getting dressed (did not even knock the door ) , if the service and staff were more helpful and you actually cared about your guests this place would be amazing",4,2017,05,12
119,Outstanding!!,"Honestly can't express how amazing this stay was! We stayed for one night and had a dinner and breakfast, both were absolutely delicious! The huge beds were so comfy and the view on a night was lovely all lit up. Room service was very good, great cocktails and the staff were nice and helpful! Definitely 10/10",5,2017,05,11
119,Gorgeous Hotel with Fab Staff and Excellent Meeting Space,"I stayed here for one night on business, to hold a social event here in May 2017 and I have to say that the venue is wonderful! Brilliant staff who couldn't do enough for us and the venue is quite simply stunning!!. Its located right next to Excel and has ama=zing views of Canary Wharf and the London docklands.

First impressions were superb - you enter via a lift to the reception level, which is very glamorous
10/10

The bedrooms were surprisingly spacious - not like a ship's cabin at all. Lots of room, nice amenities and a comfy bed! The bathroom was equally spacious and well laid out. The shower was amazingly powerful! Perfect!
10/10

General…..
WiFi was excellent - was totally free and worked really well all over the hotel.

Breakfast was very nice, lots of options and very nice to be sitting on one of the upper decks overlooking Canary Wharf.
9/10

Staff were brilliant - couldn't do enough for us. Hugo and the team looking after us for our event were amazing!!
10/10

Summary: A lovely hotel, great staff, great surrounding and superb facilities!",5,2017,05,11
119,Wonderful Stay on the Water,"What a wonderful place to stay!  The who place oozes luxury and you feel really privilege to be part of it from the moment you step into the lift from the dockside.  There is even the grand staircase.

Having said that you the staff are incredibly welcoming, whoever you are and seem to genuinely like working on board and more than happy to chat about what you are doing in London.

Our room/cabin was dockside with a balcony and as night fell the lights came on in the surrounding area and the reflections in the water was beautiful.  Having never been on a yacht or liner before I can't compare the rooms but there seemed to be nothing boat like about it, except for the view and the bathroom door.  And it doesn't move as the yacht is securely anchored to the side.

We ate in the restaurant and the food was some of the best in London.  Great menu with a bias towards fish dishes.  However the prices do reflect the quality.  I also thought it wonderful that the majority ladies on board seemed to make the most of the opportunity and 'dressed' for dinner. 

The dock is very close to London city airport and the planes do seem to line up with the water to land so you do get to see them quite close however it is not a busy airport so this didn't prove to be a problem.

If you are able to time your stay so that you can be there on a Sunday night the costs are also less.",5,2017,05,11
119,Reborn at SUNBORN...,"Excellent staff,service,food facilities...the whole accomodation was great and of course the best view while enjoying dinner!!!We will certainly visit SUNBORN again and reccomend to all our friends to stay to stay there.",5,2017,05,11
119,Dinner at the Sunborn,The staff was excellent and Domick who was serving us knew everything we wanted to know. We choose a specific wine and gave us good advice to try another ( at no extra cost). The food was lovely and the choice was brilliant.,5,2017,05,10
119,Sun born ,"
We visited the Sunborn last weekend, the food was amazing and the service outstanding. Such a beautiful venue, we will be going back to enjoy a glass of champagne on the decks during the summer. The view was also outstanding. We'll be back as soon as possible. 

",5,2017,05,10
119,Outstanding,"What can I say, I was completely amazed with the Sunborn yacht from start to finish. We attended our friend’s daughter’s christening event and this is definitely the place to hold a special event. Great food and service, amazing atmosphere and views. Will definitely go back for a stay and recommend to my friends.",5,2017,05,10
119,WOW,"We visited the Sunborn for a Christening event, the yacht is completely amazing, it feels like you're on a cruise and not in London at all. The celebration was on the top deck and the views were just stunning. I think that I have never tasted food so delicious. The service was great, the staff was always smiling and were checking on our satisfaction regularly, showing that they care about their guests. I highly recommend the Sunborn to everyone.",5,2017,05,10
119,Great Weekend,"We had an amazing time at the Sunborn Hotel! We enjoyed every part of our visit there: the room was great with a superb view, the staff was very friendly and tended to all of our needs and the food was really delicious! I highly recommend it and will visit it again for sure!",5,2017,05,10
119,Lovely Weekend,"We spent a lovely 'couple' weekend at one of Sunborn's stylish yet very comfortable rooms. The accommodation was clean, beautifully decorated and practically covered all of our needs. The view both from our room and the whole yacht was simply amazing! I can't thank the staff enough for being so polite and welcoming, willing to help us in all of our requests and doing so with a great attitude as well!!! We enjoyed each and every meal we tasted: so delicious and so many options to choose from. 
This whole experience left us with the best impressions and we can't wait to visit again!!!",5,2017,05,10
119,Fantastic ,Stayed here for just one night and loved it. Wish we had booked 2 nights and will be back soon. Reception staff very helpful and rooms are luxurious. Hotel is very close to the O2 and there are plenty of shops and restaurants near the property. I would recommend the emirates skyride if travelling to the O2. ,5,2017,05,10
119,Sunborn!!!!!,"Fantastic hotel and excellent staying. Everything was perfect!!!
The scenery was just amazing and very relaxing.
I definitely recommend it for a pleasant staying and i hope to visit sunborn again!!!!!",5,2017,05,10
119,Best vacation ever,"Our stay at the hotel was definitely one of the best and most unique experiences we've had so far and the highlight of our trip to London. We were greeted at our room with a decorative towel swan, a bed filled with rose petals and exquisite  champaign accompanied by chocolate delicacies.  The welcoming, the comfort of the room, the delicious breakfast buffet, the amazing view and excellent customer service were more than the ideal destination to celebrate our engagement and would wholeheartedly recommend to anyone. 
",5,2017,05,10
119,Celebration,"Last Saturday I attended the celebration of my friend's daughter christening.
The venue was amazing with spectacular views! The food was excellent and the staff very friendly. The whole atmosphere of the hotel is so unique, it makes you want to visit again!!! i would strongly recommended to everyone!",5,2017,05,09
119,Melina's Christening celebration last Saturday,"Last Saturday we were honored to be part of Melina's christening and celebrations at one of the unique venues of  Sunborn London. The venue was beautiful decorated and the view was amazing, the staff was excellent at everything. the food was to die for, perfectly cooked and different options for everyone, the highlight was the dessert selection. I can't wait to visit again!!!",5,2017,05,09
119,Ladies weekend away.,"We were a mixed age range of 14 ladies for one night, celebrating a hen party. The Sunbourn staff made us feel extremely welcome on arrival. We were given complimentary drinks whilst we all checked in. The rooms were very clean and comfortable. This venue is excellent for anyone wanting a bit of a luxurious break away from it all. We will defiantly be returning. Fabulous. Our only regret is we didn't book for more than one night!",5,2017,05,09
119,Amazing,"We were fortunate to attend a Christening event on this beautiful yacht. The views were stunning, we had 2 buffets one for adults and one for the children with plenty of food.Food was delicious,so tasty. The service was very attentive and professional. We had an amazing time.",5,2017,05,09
119,event last Saturday,"I attended an event last Saturday. The venue is stunning,so unique and special. The food was divine,out of this world and the service impeccable. I will definitely be going back to experience the accommodation, I asked to see a room and it's huge with everything you need.",5,2017,05,08
119,TOP CLASS SERVICE & FOOD,"Stayed this weekend to celebrate our 10th wedding anniversary and from the first moment we checked in (Eva on reception) we were treated to fantastic customer service.  Our room had great views towards the 02 and the London skyline and was especially nice at night. A member of staff came to our room shortly after checking in to welcome us and to help celebrate our stay presented us with some lovely white chocolate truffles (which didn't last long!)  We had a couple of drinks in the bar before heading upstairs to the restaurant, I must say the meal was one of the best I have had in a long time, yes it was fine dining but you weren't left feeling hungry like many fine dining restaurants I have visited over the years.  The next morning the wife and I had spa treatments booked and again the level of service was fantastic and both the wife and I left feeling we should of booked to stay longer.  We can't wait to return.",5,2017,05,08
119,Celebration,"Interesting place to stay, with a wonderful view of the Victoria Docks area, luxurious cabins! The Lands End Restaurant had a great view, lovely food, the set menu was good value. The cable cars decorate the Skyline day & night.",5,2017,05,08
119,Amazing and special stay,"It was my fiance’s birthday and I surprised him with a one night stay on the yacht, which I know has always been a dream of his. We made the most of our beautiful room and enjoyed some amazing espresso martinis at the bar. 

It was so lovely and we had a really special weekend, so thank you so much to all the team there on Sunday night for making it such an enjoyable stay! 

A lovely touch was the Molton Brown toiletries in the bathroom - a real treat.",5,2017,05,08
119,Sunborn,Had a lovely stay on the Sunborn for my husband's 70th birthday. They room was lovely. Staff were attentive and helpful. The food was good. Royal Victoria Dock station is the closest. Just make sure you exit to the right.,5,2017,05,07
119,West End Show,We Had Booked A Show in the west end and we wanted a special place to stay when we arrived and was able to park right outside the yacht the welcome was very good the staff were extremely helpful once in the room it was large and roomy and had everything you could have wanted everything was easy to find the bar and restaurant was a big surprise staff was on hand for everything you wanted drinks was a bit expensive but no more than I expected would stay there again,5,2017,05,07
119,A hotel with a difference,"Booked here as a Birthday treat and wasn't disappointed. We chose to upgrade on arrival and had a lovely room with river views. Very comfortable room but very hot in the night as we couldn't turn the air con down and it seemed to be set on hot!
Nice bar area where you can sit on the veranda and look out over canary wharf.
Only complaint is being slightly misled on the discount for drinks/food bill (due to upgrading) the following day at check out the initial discount offered had been reduced but was soon rectified when highlight. Another point to note is that service charge in the bar is added to your bill, even if you have to go an get your own drinks they add a service charge so worth waiting for waiter service.
Lovely breakfast the following morning with a vast choice of items.",5,2017,05,07
119,Wow ...prepare to be amazed !,"Loved it ! My husband and myself spent 2 nights aboard this luxury yacht, although it is provisionally a hotel it is afloat, even if it doesn't go anywhere! reception staff were very friendly and very helpful. Our room was riverside with balcony and was exactly as the pictures show, relaxing enjoying and so peaceful, the central airport is close by but the noise was not at all an issue, in fact we enjoyed watching them take off and land, the illuminations of the dockside at night we absolutely amazing,. we did book the restaraunt but there was little on the menu for myself as I am a vegetarian so we opted for room service and robes, which turned out to be a great choice , a few more dishes to choose from with the added comfort of your own room and romantic views over the docksid,  tray service charge of £5 was well worth it. The bed was really comfortable and large, the shower room was pristine clean as was the room all bar a few marks here and there from abusive previous guests. Some of these were an easy fix which should really be addressed by house management such as stains to the carpet and the settee but did not distract from the wonderful time we spent here. We had an (expensive) cocktail on the back deck and the sun was shining which was a definite bonus. There is disabled parking at the harbourside adjacent to the yacht, not sure about other parking although I'm sure the reception could advice about this. We would definitely stay here again. It is a little expensive but we like the finer things and for this you pay a price. Book with confidence and enjoy a little luxury ! All in all we had a great time .",5,2017,05,06
119,Amazing!!,"This was my second trip to the Sunborn Yacht,because I loved it sooo much the first time!
It surpassed my memories,and I cannot find enough adjectives to describe how lovely staying in this hotel is! From the friendliness, and professionalism of the staff to the superb rooms, and great food this yacht is excellent.The weather was beautiful on this second visit, which meant we could sit outside on the yacht and admire the stunning views over London, whilst sipping our Pimms.Having a cabin with its own balcony is also reccommended, so you can enjoy views over the Thames, the O2 arena and the nearby Emirates cable cars.
The rooms themselves are also luxurious, with great coffee/tea making facilities, Molton Brown toiletries,large comfy beds, room service and free wifi.
Being picky, the only criticism I would have of the hotel is firstly the toasters at breakfast BADLY need improving! The breakfasts themselves are amazing, with EVERY taste catered for, from cereals and fruit salad, to meats,cheese and mini pastries through to a full cooked breakfast, and it's a serve yourself....which I love. However, if you do want toast the toasters are unbelievably slow, and are extremely frustrating if you have to stand or queue for 10mins, just for a slice of toast! I'm certain this could easily be remedied by buying faster toasters.
The only other disadvantage of the hotel is its situation,if you want to be in central London,this is probably not the hotel for you. We don't mind using the Tube, and having changes, but if you aren't the most mobile or have children it could be difficult travelling to and from the yacht.
As I said that's just being picky, I would stay at the Sunborn every time I visit London! You won't find a more beautiful and luxurious small hotel, with any friendlier or helpful staff and wonderful meals.... what more can I say?!! 😍👍🏻🛳⚓️ I LOVE YOU SUNBORN!!",5,2017,05,06
119,"Amazing staff, beautiful venue","Yet to stay here (fingers crossed it will be soon!) but was here during the week for drinks. It is certainly a unique and very special place in London. With amazing views of London, welcoming and friendly staff and a great ambience. It's a gem. 

Can not wait to stay here. 

A big shout out to Carlos who was attentive and professional and Hugo for all his help.",4,2017,05,05
119,Our stay at the Sunborn Yacht Hotel,"We stayed at the Sunborn Yacht Hotel for 2 nights on our recent trip to London.
The entrance to the hotel is actually two lifts that take you up to reception. As you walk out of the lift a pretty impressive large chandelier and two curved staircases greet you.
Check in time is 3 pm, and we arrived early. The staff were really helpful, we were able to check in and and our bags where looked after until our room was ready. This enabled us to start exploring the yacht.
We booked a Classic King room with Dockview and were not disappointed. Our room was number 1027. The window was decent size looking out onto the dock, not a spectacular view, but enough to watch the world go by.
The room was bigger than we had expected with a really comfortable queen size bed. The shower was a good size too with complimentary Molten Brown toiletries which was a real treat! As on cruise ships there is a lip and step into the bathroom, do remember this, unfortunately we didn’t which resulted in a few stubbed toes.
There was a sofa and coffee table with a TV opposite and there was also a selection of books available. The desk area was a decent size, with multiple plug sockets both English flat three pin and European round two pin all around the room.
The wardrobes were a decent size with ironing facilities, the only criticism would be that there were only 4 hangers, not a huge problem but what is it with the majority of hotels and the lack of hangers! There was a good size digital safe which was big enough for a laptop too.
The Sundown bar lounge area is directly behind reception and leads out onto a deck area with seating. The views from the outside area look over to the O2 Arena and the Emirates Cable Car.
It is a large bar area with a extensive selection but drinks are very expensive, as you would expect on a yacht in London.
There is also a restaurant where you can choose to have breakfast at an extra cost. We chose to eat out and bought snacks to have with the complimentary tea and coffee before we went out for the day.
WiFi was excellent and available throughout the Yacht.
From Paddington it was easy, change at Canning Town on the DLR and take the service towards Beckton. Get off at Royal Victoria (Custom House was closed) and take a short walk towards the ExCel. You will see the Sunborn Yacht Hotel.
The purpose of our visit was to see Bruno Mars in concert at the O2 arena and the location appeared perfect, and it was.
The ExCel is literally next door and the O2 arena can be reached easily either by the Emirates Cable Car or DLR/Tube to North Greenwich. We discovered that you could save money on all transport if you used a contactless bank card, paying cash was always more expensive, so if you have one use it.
There are restaurants in very close proximity to the hotel and also a Nisa local and Tesco Express. 
The location is ok for exploring central London too but can take a little while to get to other areas via the DLR. Take this into consideration when planning your trip to London.
We really enjoyed our stay at the Sunborn Yacht Hotel, a floating hotel which is a unique idea, and it really is perfect for a special treat.",5,2017,05,04
119,1 night of bliss,"Stayed at the sunborn yacht hotel as a last minute surprise for my husbands birthday. The whole experience was great from the minute we arrived. 
The room size was very big. the staff were all lovely and always smiling and helpful. 
the dinner in the restaurant was mouth watering. and the cocktails were great too. 
we received vouchers for free champagne at the bar too. cant wait to go again",5,2017,05,04
119,Bit of a treat really!,"I only got to enjoy one night here, staying in a 5th floor executive riverside room, which was really nice. 
The en-suite shower room was very comprehensive though a little compact with a door that's a bit too eager to close itself but then it is still a yacht after all!
The service I received from all the staff and was faultless, breakfast superb and look forward to the next excuse to stay here! 
Enjoy! 😃
",5,2017,05,03
119,Amazing,"Extraordinary and sumptuous looks, from the moment you step in. Nice reception staff, always helpful and smiling. The rooms are very large and comfortable with all amenities available. It's a shame that the bathrooms look so dated.",4,2017,05,03
119,Unusual Hotel,"My husband booked a night on the yacht as a Christmas prezzie for us. Looked very impressive on arrival to the reception. Had afternoon tea booked which was excellent. Very annoyed that on arrival the waiter asked if we would like water I asked for glass of water and all of sudden we were paying £4.50 for a bottle before we could leave. Going by the cost we decided that we wouldn't eat or drink there. Went on the cable car to the O2 and had dinner and drinks great time was had by us!!
The room was nice to look at but carpet did look tired. 
Great experience as a one off. 
.",4,2017,05,02
119,Lovely stay. ,"We stayed here for our anniversary weekend. The room was nice with a view of the excel. 
The room could have done with a bit of tidying up. Part of the floor was covered in coffee and nail varnish, the woodwork was chipped and the sofa ripped, but this was a really quirky place to stay. 
But for £50 for 4 cocktails I won't be rushing back. ",5,2017,05,02
119,Fabulous,My friend came over from Spain and we stayed on the sunborn for one night... we were blown away it certainly is luxurious .... the staff were all so helpfull... our little angel Isabel is a reall gem... so helpfull and always a lovely smile and conversation... can't praise her enough..:-) food was excellent . Rooms excellent. Every thing was excellent so much so have booked to go again in July ...,5,2017,05,01
119,memorable,"Never stepped foot on a yacht before booking the Sunborn for a few visits to events hosted at the Excel so the experience is unquestionably different. In a good way. Possibly because of the water this place feels more relaxing than your usual London hotel. Always of a high standard as far as cleanliness, the rooms are spacious and equipped with everything you require, personally preferred the ones with wooden flooring. Warm at all times no matter how low the outside temperature is. The bar terrace has the potential to be a fantastic way of ending a day with a couple of drinks under the Canary Wharf lights just before heading to sleep. Mostly interacted with the evening staff (the unsung heroes of the hospitality industry really) due to my late arrivals, thanks for taking good care of me Gents & Jo. Would recommend for short stays and special occasions (anniversaries, weddings and bar mitzvahs).",5,2017,05,01
119,Massive room,I stayed at this hotel with a difference whilst on business trip in London. It is an impressive hotel at docklands. The room I had was huge compared to London standards and had king bed but could have easily fitted two king beds in it. The bed was comfy and I had a room overlooking the water on the 1st floor which is closest to the water as reception is on level 3. The room facilities were good and had safe and free wifi which was average.  I didn't use the restaurant facilities so cannot comment although I briefly looked at menu and I thought it was expensive. I only stayed two nights as I got a good rate which was within my work budget as it's not normally. I found it more of a trek commuting to the office but it would be great if visiting the excel as right next to it. I would stay again though if rates were okay and depending where I am commuting too,4,2017,04,30
119,Anniversary,"Bought as a gift 1 night with breakfast in a executive room but upgraded to water side
Worth the extra,
Everything clean ,staff excellent 
Food in restaurant was very good as was the breakfast 
Car park was only a few minutes away and £ 15 for 24 hrs cheap for London 
Would return",5,2017,04,30
119,One night,"I was brought this as a Birthday present via Groupon by my daughter which was a lovely surprise.I took my husband along the room was lovely and big a king size bed,we didn't have the river view but had a balcony which was good very good meal in the restaurant and good staff.we had a drink on the back of the y boat while the sun was going down and the view was great with all the London sights.A good break for a special occasion.",5,2017,04,29
119,Attending a Conference at Excel,"We were attending a conference at Excel which was right next door. 
It is a little out of the way, about 40+ minutes from the city, on the light rail so need to transfer to the Tube, not a big deal however. There are a few restaurants close by and a pub + Tesco close by.
There is no real drop off or pick up area - there is a boom gate that I assume the taxi/car could enter and drop you off at the front entrance but it is not clear, no directions or instruction. Very hard for taxis to find - can see it but how to get to it is the issue!
The room size was good, the bathroom was small, the bed was comfortable but it was like two bases put together with a mattress topper. Furniture was OK.
Excellent WiFi - free with the room.
Our room was on the 1st floor and looked out at the wharf and people's feet walking by. We knew we didn't have a river view...... we were at the conference all day so not a big issue.
Rolls of carpet in the hallway for all of the 5 day stay was poor form.
The hotel didn't seem very full so a little disappointed we weren't given an upgraded room given we paid a £272 a night.
Was quirky but if there is a next time we would try and get into one of the other hotels.",3,2017,04,29
119,Lovely Stay,"We were bought this as a gift via Groupon and it included a 1 night stay with a 2 course meal, breakfast and late check out. Rooms were so lovely, we upgraded to a balcony room and it was great. 
Everything was so clean. 
The rooms included hot drink facilities, fridge, hairdryer, Molton Brown toiletries, a tablet, robes and slippers. 
Food in restaurant was outstanding and breakfast provided so much choice. 
Bar area was lovely and relaxing, drinks on the pricey side but nothing abnormal for London. 
We took the wrong exit out of the tube station due to lack of signage and it took us around 45 minutes to walk to the yacht. Had we taken the correct exit it would of been about a 10 minute walk. 
",5,2017,04,28
119,I went to this hotel for an overnight stay for my birthday because I thought it looked really special.,"The entrance was a little disappointing and didn't really have the 'wow' factor although the middle staircase was lovely.  On entering towards our room, there were rolls of new carpet stacked up against the wall which was surprising for such a high class venue.  The room was lovely and spacious, but the carpet was dirty.  The restaurant was nice and the food was extremely good - we left a large tip (but wouldn't have been quite so generous, if we had realised how much of a service charge we would be paying!) Generally I thought it was overpriced for what it was and I have experienced better.  Location wise, it was an hour from central London which was another issue for us - but that was down to our own bad planning.",3,2017,04,27
119,"Lovely champagne afternoon tea, facial and back massage.","I came here with my boyfriend for a birthday. The yacht is amazing. The food provided for afternoon tea was delicious and sufficient. I made special requests and they were happy to provide. The spa was great too, very relaxing and professional. Massage was great and the facilities were clean and to a high standard. The staff are polite and courteous. Would strongly recommend.",5,2017,04,27
119,"Great Hotel, Beautiful yacht, Very roomy","Great hotel with a nice novelty of being on a yacht (albeit a very large luxurious one).  You cannot feel the fact that you are on water as it is based in a dockland marina/wharf/quay  but has lovely views.  Perfect destination for the Excel arena which is literally next door (you cant hear anything though). Lovely large rooms. Very clean.  Staff are very professional and friendly demonstrating excellent customer service skills.  A very luxurious feel and on the night we stayed cheaper than the nearby IBIS and Novotel (and far more appealing).  Would highly recommend and look forward to staying there again in the future,",5,2017,04,26
119,"Had an amazing experience, celebrated my birthday here, 1st time on a yacht and will definetely go again.","people were so lovely, friendly and welcoming. the rooms were spacious, clean and very comfortable. lovely view with balcony. felt as if on a cruise ship. food was excellent, had a celebrated afternoon champayne tea.",5,2017,04,26
119,Quiet but special,"I booked a treatment with afternoon tea for two for my daughter as a birthday present. Our day started with arriving via the Emirates cable car which gave us a spectacular view of the ship and once on board we were met by friendly and helpful staff.
The facial and massage were excellent, so relaxing and the ladies continually pampered us for an hour which left us feeling very refreshed and ready to face the world and the afternoon tea. We were very pleased to see that the sandwiches and cakes presented were delicate and not, as most offer these days, laden with sickly fancies and although a very quiet day, with not many tables taken, the peace and quiet to catch up and savour the view was very welcoming. The staff here too could not have been more helpful and whilst serving were also happy and obliging to take charge of our camera and take memorable photographs for us. I have already booked to return, this time with my husband and to stay overnight and naturally we are looking forward to it very much. Many thanks to all and see you again soon.",5,2017,04,26
119,Birthday present,"Had a one night luxury room with breakfast, late checkout and afternoon tea as a present from my son and daughter in law...... wow what a gift we had a few problems because she had booked it via groupon who are useless!! So unfair to blame the hotel for the awful check in mix up . We had a room on the 4th floor with a balcony looking out over the river so it was great fun watching the planes landing at the city airport. The bed was massive the room very nice with extra touches like the fluffy robes and slippers. The breakfast was excellent and the staff very good. I didn't think there was very much to do in the area at all we caught the DLR into Greenwich and went on the skyline but apart from that unless there is something going on at the Excel or O2 the area is pretty much deserted or it was when we were there !!! Still a great one off experience",4,2017,04,25
119,Fantastic Sunborn Hotel,"A treat by my wife for my 60th and what a treat
It was a final part of a great weekend with my family and they couldn't  have been friendlier 
They even presented me with three little cakes and a birthday song
Basically the hotel had the wow factor from the accommodation ,facilities through to the people and will absolutely go again especially during the excel boat show
Thank you Sunborn for a memorable  visit",5,2017,04,25
119,Wonderful night away,"The nicest hotel I've ever stayed in! Rooms are clean, large, beds are comfy and the location is great. Would definitely recommend paying a little extra for a river view - we were in a standard room but still had a lovely view of the docks, the river and could see the cable cars and O2 over to the right. Service is very good and polite, the whole hotel is very classy and stylish. Would love to return!",5,2017,04,24
119,A step back in time ,This  is not a minimalist trendy hotel . It is a luxury boat with chandeliers and polished brass. Service was first class as was the breakfast. We had a river view executive . Lovely views up and down the river. Would I stay again. Yes. ,5,2017,04,24
119,Majestic,"From the moment we set foot aboard nothing failed to disappoint .. charming welcome on arrival with complimentary champagne .. wow was the room amazing an executive suite that had a bed so big you got lost ! The bar and decking area was outstanding although a little small but we did manage to get an outside table and enjoy our bar food along with drinks in the beautiful sunshine.. after our evening we returned for more drinks available until 2am if you wished .. a good night's sleep followed by a self service breakfast which was excellently presented but for the standard of the hotel I would have really preferred table service however the food was 10 out of 10 check out was quick and efficient...
Can't wait for a return visit ..as this one was majestic ",5,2017,04,24
119,Beautiful hotel,"Beautiful hotel, very spacious and amazing breakfast. My boyfriend did well x Room had everything even an iPad. Close to train station and 02. Lovely balcony to relax on and staff very friendly and helpful. Very clean and has a luxury feel, Molten brown in the bathroom, my favorite. Will definitely return x x",5,2017,04,23
119,Great and original hotel,Fantastic idea for a hotel. Beautiful interiors and great buffet breakfast. Afternoon tea on deck was perfect. Interesting part of London. Lovely staff and very friendly such as Isabel Cristina. More details of review on Lavender's Blue,5,2017,04,23
119,Perfection from the start.,"I had booked this one night stay as a Mother's Day gift for, well, my mother of course.  From the moment we arrived and were checked in by the lovely, helpful Andrea, it just got better and better and........
We had paid extra for a river view room and located on deck 5 it did not disappoint: with exquisite views of the Royal Victoria Dock area and nearly all of London's most iconic tall buildings as a back drop against the setting sun. 
Just when we were beginning to think it couldn't get much better we are served the BEST Aperol Spritzes EVER!
And then we went to the Lands End Restaurant situated on the aft deck and there we met the hero of the hour: our wonderful waiter, Laszlo.  The food itself was exquisite: hot, tasty and beautifully presented.  But Laszlo really was the proverbial ""cherry on the cake"".  So efficient and so very charming.  
What a precious gift you have, Laszlo - to make us feel so very special with your very attentive and gracious service.
We shall certainly be recommending Sunborn London as a hotel of choice in London.",5,2017,04,23
119,"Lovely decor, bad nights sleep","The boat is stunning, the decor, the views, the breakfast are all amazing. I stayed in room 1030 which is lower deck, big room, comfortable bed, fluffy towels and everything you could need. However the room is above some kind of water pipe and the noise was very loud. There was a further noise that vibrated through the bed as well but that stopped at 1ish AM. Went to reception at 11pm re the noise and they said they would deal with it however as I had not slept by 2:30 AM ( due to water pipe) I called through and they moved me to the room opposite. It was less noisy. They dealt with the situation well in the morning with redress (I still paid full price) and they apologised. I realise it's a boat however not a moving boat so I would not expected these types of noises tbh. So I would say yes stay here it's a lovely experience and a stunning surrounding in the boat however take ear plugs and be aware that you will get engine/ pipe noise as the receptionist called it. 
I only had breakfast here and that was well presented and very nice, I can not comment on the food in the restaurant as due to previous reviews and cost of a main I ate off site. Lots of restaurants and pubs a walk away.  Staff are all polite as expected. I stay in lots of hotels with my job both high end and budget and honestly now I have experienced the Sunborn I would not stay again purely down to the bad nights sleep.",3,2017,04,23
119,Needs a makeover!,"Me and my partner stayed for one romantic night in March 2016
First impressions from the outside were ""amazing' ""very grand"". Inside... was a little different. The hotel inside was very old fashion, defo needs a damn good makeover, doesnt look like it's been touched since it was first made into a hotel!  We booked the executive suite for nearly £500 a night... So as you can imagine were expecting something amazing! The room was actually really nice... but we also had the front deck of the ship which was awful. NOTHING like the pictures. 2 old grotty, broken Sun loungers, a tiny cheap table and chairs to sit on out on the deck... honestly so disappointing. For the money i was expecting soooo much more of a wow factor not cheap broken garden furniture to try and fill the huge space!
The restaurant... again Needs updating decor wise however the food... amazing! Really impressive and worth the money!
All in all a very mixed review on this hotel, some big positives and also some huge let downs.",3,2017,04,22
119,Unique ambience!,"The Sunborn Yacht Hotel is a truly unique place to stay in East London. It is moored directly outside the main entrance to the Excel Exhibition and Conference Centre.  I stayed there for two nights in April while attending an exhibition/conference.  Reception staff were very welcoming and I felt nothing was too much trouble for them. They were very helpful throughout, especially when I locked myself out of my room. My room had its own balcony facing south out over the water. What a great place to wake up!  The view in both directions was fantastic, especially towards Canary Wharf.

The bedroom was large and very comfortable. There is a nice bar immediately behind reception, again with good views.  Breakfast was excellent! On my second night I used room service for a late dinner and was impressed with the quality of food and service.

Throughout my stay I was made most welcome and the quality of customer care shown by Sunborn staff made a big impression on me.  A big thank you to everyone I met there!",5,2017,04,22
119,Weekend trip to the O2 with a difference,I got a great deal on Booking.com for the Sunborne. The price was very reasonable and compatible with nearby hotels. It was easy to find and reception staff were helpful with directions prior to arrival. The hotel looks incredibly posh and access to all levels from outside via the lift was good. Reception staff were helpful & efficient. Our room was lovely and spacious. The bed was comfortable. The shower was very good and the towels were amazing! Very happy & quirky stay,5,2017,04,19
119,All aboard,"We had a standard room facing the dock but I have to say there is nothing standard about it.  The room is very large, the bed large and comfortable, the shower powerful, towels a decent size (a real bug bear of mine when towels are tiny) and everything very clean.  The whole Yacht feels quite luxurious.  Drinks in the bar were very nice but prices a bit on the steep side although we did expect that was going to be the case. Service was also a little slow, unlike at breakfast when we had the table cleared when we were only getting our food from the buffet and had to ask from cutlery etc to be replaced..  The Sunborn is quite a distance from central London and we caught a river boat for the journey from London bridge which cost around £7 each.",4,2017,04,19
119,Exec suite = AMAZING,"I booked an executive suite for my partners birthday in March and my god it did not disappoint! 
The website honestly does not do this room justice, its huge - with a separate living room, hallway, bedroom and your own mini spa with double showers, jacuzzi and sauna! 
The mini bar was well stocked and included in the price as well which we though was a great touch.
We ate breakfast and dinner on board and both were great and they catered well to my special diary requests with no prior warning.

To anyone wondering if the exec suit is worth the extra money my answer would be a big fat yes! book it now!!",5,2017,04,19
119,Fantastic experience!,"Booked a nights stay from an offer an from Groupon. I had a free treatment within the offer and the facial was by far the best I had and very relaxing. I paid £45 extra to add for birthday balloons and banners and a cake which was nice but a bit disappointed as they did not do what was requested and agreed as I wanted 30th balloons and the cake to say happy birthday so a point down for that.

Our dock room was very nice and clean. Nice facilities and loved there was a mini shower near the toilets. Shower was great and nice touch to add the Molton Brown products. Staff are very nice and welcoming. Rip off for coffee £4 and was cold. 

Breakfast was very good. A wide selection and really presented well. Overall a fantastic stay and my husband truly loved it as everything was walking distance and we had the Emirates Air line right next to it. I would recommend to stay here for an occasion to embark on the memory. ",4,2017,04,18
119,boating good fun,"Got a groupon deals with a room and dinner ,we upgraded to a balcony room which was fantastic ,comfy bed ,lovely shower and sofa and a view of the river ,had drinks at the bar and cocktails which were lovely and not a bad price ,evening food and service very good ,the boat is very big and is better than a hotel seeing its in the docklands and by the excel and cross the bridge to the 02 and cable car good fun too .so location is great , breakfast very nice too",5,2017,04,17
119,Pure affordable luxury static cruise,"What an absolutely fantastic stay for 2 nights over Easter for our dads birthday. Our family executive room with balcony looked over the dock was ready for us to check in early at 1pm on Good Friday. The room was amazing, never had so much space for 3 people to stay in London. Best nights sleep for a long time. Huge King/Queen size bed and large sofa bed both very comfortable. Plenty of complimentary tea, coffee and water. 2 lots of toiletries and plenty of towels. 

All the staff were so friendly and acknowledged us all the time. Isabel couldn’t do enough for us all weekend. 
Breakfast buffet before 9am was £7.50 each both mornings. 
Sundown bar served the best toastie (Classic croque monsieur) and burger we have ever tasted. Cooked and Served very quickly. A definite must while taking in the beautiful sights. 

The Emirates cable car 5mins walk away for a quick 15min crossing to get to the O2.

We will only ever stay here when we visit London from now on, using Uber to and from the Sunborn each day, so cheap (Waterloo station to Sunborn £18).  Pure affordable luxury that makes you feel like your on a real cruise.",5,2017,04,17
119,Brilliant,Good location next to many restaurants the rooms are great spent my wife's birthday there we had a brilliant time the rooms are clean the service is great it's a really cool place to spend a birthday or anniversary night,5,2017,04,17
119,Amazing mother and daughter luxary  weekend away,"From the moment we checked in it was wonderful ! Friendly and helpful staff and attentive to our needs ! Reception staff really helped to make our stay even better by suggesting an upgrade of room and ensuring we had the best ! 
The room was spacious and very comfortable !  You wouldn't get is size in any hotel for the price else where .
The location was peaceful but also interesting and away from the hustle and bustle of the city. And the hotel was also lovely and peaceful so made for a very relaxing but fun stay.
The food in the restaurant was superb for our evening meal and the breakfast was delicious. 
Very happy guests and will definitely be returning !!",5,2017,04,17
119,Interesting idea.,"Does exactly what it says on the tin. It's a large yacht moored on the Thames next to the Arena.

Good location, great restaurant, good service, great rooms, fabulous decor, what more do you want. 

Not the cheapest hotel, granted, but you get what you pay for. The view of the city at night from the rear bar deck is stunning.",4,2017,04,16
119,Unique Yacht to stay on in London's Docklands,"It is not what you would normally think of to stay on in central London but the Yacht Hotel (also known as the Sunborn) is a gem - it is a moored Yacht on the Thames with excellent facilities, is quiet but near to large attractions like the O2 & Excel.",4,2017,04,16
119,Fabulous,We had this bought as a Christmas present from my daughter and what a great gift it was!  The room was spacious and immaculate and the restaurant had lovely food and fabulous views. The staff were all very professional and friendly. Would recommend  to anyone☺,5,2017,04,15
119,Lunch,"Visited his beautiful static yacht hotel for lunch. The yacht remains static in the Royal Victoria Dock and is great to stay on board and use the sun excellent hotel facilities of just visit for a drink. You can also enjoy a meal on board, perhaps lunch or dinner.
The food is beautifully presented and the service is excellent. The drinks are a little pricey but then you are paying for the uniqueness of this yacht.
Well worth a visit either lunch or dinner.
No parking available from the boat but an NCP car park is very close by- easy walking distance.  ",4,2017,04,15
119,Fantastic Easter Stay,"Stayed over Easter as part of a Groupon deal. Was not disappointed. From the minute we arrived we were made to feel very welcome by all the staff. And reassuringly the venue was not pretentious in the slightest. We upgraded our room for one with a balcony, which was well worth it. Rooms are a very good size, with complimentary water, wi-if and an in room tablet for browsing. Ate in The Lands End restaurant in the evening and for breakfast and on both occasions the food was excellent.

As a venue it is kept spotlessly clean and we were very impressed. 

Fantastic location too for visiting the O2 or going on the Emirates Skyline.",5,2017,04,15
119,Best Hotel In London,"I travel for work and I'm somewhat of a frustrated hotel Inspector!  So  I have not titled my review lightly, this really is the best hotel in London..... 
We booked a family executive Seaview balcony room for 1 night , Thursday. We parked at the Excel which is located nearest to the hotel, 24 hrs £20. We booked a cream tea for 12.30 but didn't want to go back for our bags as check in isn't until 3pm. We spoke to reception who organised for our bags to be stored and they completed our paperwork there and then and guided us to afternoon tea, no drama first class first impressionstep of the hotel staff. 
We had a fantastic afternoon tea , our daughter had the childrens lunch menu which was a good value. The dining area is great, super views. The food was excellent , however the service was first class, I sensed we were in for a great Stay!  
After our tea we were checked in fully , and we're actually upgraded , room 5033 , if your looking for a great experience either as a couple of with a young family this suite room was superb. We were escorted to our room by the customer liaison team member who made a fuss of our daughter getting her to open all the doors  and she showed us around the suite and checked on our plans for the stay, our bags were brought to the room and after a 5min video frenzy by our daughter who couldn't wait to upload the suite video to her friends we relaxed enjoying the suite. 
We then went up west , the DLR is 2mins away. By early evening with the whole of London to eat at , we all couldn't wait to get back to the yacht. After a drink at the hotel lounge bar we decided that room service had to be the best bet in order to enjoy the suite fully. Once again though we were met by warm and attentive lounge staff who offered advice for the room service menu. The room service was very prompt and food was excellent. 
After a lovely night we went to breakfast , new staff and we were met once again by attentive and professional staff. I would like to congratulate the hotel GM and trainers because although the location is great the quality of the hotel is FAB I have to say that every staff member was super friendly and professional,  these guys made the trip and experience even better for me. I couldn't wait to get home today to write this review. World Class staff , planning on booking Gibraltar next ! JW",5,2017,04,14
119,"Great stay, excellent service ","What a superb evening. This hotel and restaurant really takes you away; we felt like we were on holiday. Food was top class, a good drinks selection and we thoroughly enjoyed our 'getaway' evening.

Top marks for service as well, particularly Petr (Asst restaurant Mgr) and Allessandro (Bar Manager). Their service was deserving of Michelin star status, Sunborn will do well to keep them. 

Would definitely recommend ",5,2017,04,13
119,Amazing Stay,"We were bought an overnight stay b & b with afternoon tea as a Christmas present from my daughter.  My husband booked an additional night.  What an amazing experience.  From the moment we arrived, we were made very welcome and nothing was too much trouble for the staff.  The accommodation was wonderful and food fantastic.  Excellent location, felt as though I was on holiday and felt totally relaxed. I would definitely stay there again and recommend to anyone.",5,2017,04,13
119,Unique london hotel experience,"Sunborn yacht hotel is a great alternative hotel experience for London. Berthed near excel it is very convenient for docklands and only a short journey on dlr into central london. It os a small cruise liner but without an engine! - permanently berthed and secured to dock side but floating on water. U do get a slight movement feeling from veeing on the water. Decor is high class and everything u would expect of a cruise ship including sweeping staircase and large crystal chandelier.  Looks best at night when all lit up on deck etc. Rooms/cabins are a decent size and well furnished. It is worth paying supplement for waterside rooms which include own private small balcony. Bar and restaurant are suitably impressive for a 5 star cruise liner.  Staff very pleasant - both helpful and friendly. A good nights sleep away from any traffic noise but london ciry airport is close by and flights do start before breakfast - planes so close on take off that you Can see passenger faces in the windows!  Fortunately only smaller, quieter planes are allowed to use city airport.",5,2017,04,13
119,Amazing,"I stayed at the Sunborn 1st Aprill with my 2 daughters, this was a gift for my 60th with a concert at the O2. When the guest relations executive knew it was my special birthday we were upgraded to a junior suit , this included drinks on the VIP deck. Maryiam was absolutely amazing and had wonderful customer service skills as did all of the staff. We were made to feel so welcome and made my special birthday more special. Thank you Maryiam I will definitely be back .",5,2017,04,12
119,Anniversary Break ,"Just got back from staying at the Sunborn Yacht and what can i possible say! First time for everything and I am stunned. When checking in we were upgraded to V.I.P which involved us being moved to an executive suite due to having family who know the manager. The executive suite gave us a balcony of our own and a view of the River Thames, what a beautiful view that was.

The staff are very welcoming and attentive, they cater for your every need, anything you want or need just ask its done within seconds. The room was a very good size which included tea and coffee facilities, a mini fridge and a coffee machine, we also had welcome chocolates and a welcome letter which was nice. The yacht is a few miles from the airport and have a clear view of planes taking off however when the balcony doors are shut you cant hear a thing. 

Just round the corner of the yacht is emirates cable car which enables you to get from one side of the dock to the other, this is a different way of transporting to the main attractions in london rather than getting the train, taxi etc. 

It's not too far from the city centre and the main attractions in London such as the Tower of London and the bridge etc, again there's various transport options to take to get into the centre. 

Would highly recommend staying at the Sunborn, it's something very different but very enjoyable. ",4,2017,04,12
119,Why not,"We stayed here Sunday for one night with another couple, had booked 2 rooms with a 2 course meal in the evening and breakfast in the morning. We got a great offer online and decided why not.
On arrival the receptionist couldn't find our booking, after about 5 minutes and a little help from one of her colleagues our booking was found. We was getting a tad nervous to say the least.
Once checked in we was offered a river view for £20.00 each extra which we declined thing that's £80.00 on top of our deal price, Not much to see if you ask me for £80.00.
Had a great afternoon tea on board before setting off out too explore the area, we came across a great bar with live music playing, sun was shining and had a few beers before heading back to the Sunborn for our evening meal, We was sat by the stairs on our own even though the restaurant had room to push 2 tables together, felt a bit awkward being the only ones out there with people walking past every few minutes. Ask why we were put there and was informed that we had a river view even though it was dark and not much to see.
We proceeded to order our meals and waited for it to arrive, upon arrival one starter was completely incorrect and was offered what we ordered at the end! We declined the offer and went on to have our mains, the food was very nice.
As we had been served an incorrect starter the staff brought us out a complementary desert board with just about every thing from the menu, a great selection and that was enjoyed immensely, 
We had a great room that was very clean and well presented, the beds were very comfy and large.
We all had a great nights sleep needless to say, only criticism is that from 6am aeroplanes we're flying over and woke us up, City airport is only a stones throw away, we didn't give that a thought.
Breakfast was great and well presented, and rated excellent, along with good service.
I recommend the Sunborn to a work colleague upon returning to work and he has booked for next Wednesday as he is going to a concert at the 02. I'm sure he and his partner will enjoy the same great experience we did 
Many Thanks 
Roy & Nikki",4,2017,04,11
119,Good value for money,"I believe no hotel is worthy of 5 stars but I would feel out or order on giving 4.

1) Location- perfect, just feels like your away from busy London and has a more chilled feel. Very easy to get to wether you drive or get the train and walk for 5 minutes.

2) Rooms- really spacious and great old school identity but still a modern twist. The first room we had the electricity didn't work which was not good (but we are all humans and sometimes electricity etc can not work and go wrong, happens at any place home or hotel) so I let that one slip..... we was giving a new room pretty sharpish. Not a great start but I have benefit of the doubt as the staff response was brilliant. They also gave us breakfast on the house for this.

3) Food- set menu and a la carte was generous... cheaper then say the shard and a lot cheaper then sushi samba. Starter mains and desert was very tasty and fine cooked.. the staff even made a happy Birthday plate for my girlfriends birthday. I would say the breakfast is overpriced and not great quality but buffet breakfast in England you expect that. 

4) staff was very friendly and very very good, although I would like to see more English staff in English hotels I can't complain as the service was brilliant.

5) view and ambience was brilliant, I would give it 4.7/5.",5,2017,04,11
119,Weekday Treat,"We booked this hotel having had a voucher for it. I must say that I'm glad we did. The hotel is superb. It is a yacht moored on the Thames right outside the Excel Centre. We arrived a 3pm and our room was ready for us. This is quite a spectacular yacht to arrive at with its imposing front entrance, even better lit up at night, and lift to the reception area which is decked in brass and spectacular chandelier through the centre of the staircase. We had upgraded to a river view and our executive room had a balcony to sit on and admire the views to Canary Wharf beyond The old Dome and cable cars. What I would say that stands out from the moment you walk on is the cleanliness. The place is spotless, every nook & cranny cleaned to perfection. We had dinner and breakfast booked, a few drinks in the bar 1st though, although the service was a little slow it didn't matter as we were happy watching the world go by on the Thames. Dinner was great, fine dining standard and cooked beautifully. The staff were friendly, service excellent and a really enjoyable afternoon and night. Check out was easy enough and on our way. One thing to say is if travelling by DLR Custom House station is closed (until late December) but we got on and off at Prince Regent which is only a five or six minute walk.",5,2017,04,11
119,Amazing Nights Stay,"Stayed at this gorgeous floating yacht hotel for one night with my husband in last weekend and we had an excellent experience, well worth the money. It is located by the Excel (which is a little bit out of the way but access by local train into London centre is frequent and well run-surprisingly). You enter the Reception to find in front of you a beautiful staircase and central shining chandelier (wow). The staff are very professional and smart and when you get to your room, it is plush, very clean with everything you could need. The lounge bar leads on to the back of the yacht where we sat in the sun overlooking the River Thames – Glorious. We even went on the Emirates Royal Dock Skyline which is 2 minutes away, goes across the river and gives a wonderful all round view. We really enjoyed our stay and wanted to stay longer but couldn’t  Food was excellent, service was prompt and polite and the hotel was definitely a wow – well worth a visit, and we will return.",5,2017,04,11
119,Unique place to stay.,"The Sunborn is a different type of hotel from the normal London boring 4 walls. Docked in the Royal Victoria Dock close to the Excel it is it has the feeling of being on a cruise ship without the sea movement as it secured to the dockwall by large steel beams. We stayed in a waterside room which had a great view from a large window. The room was large with comfortable seating and table. The bed was also large and very comfortable and the room obviously had no traffic noise so a good nights sleep was guaranteed. Staff were very welcoming and helpful. I had a 'snack' after returning from the west end which was the biggest chicken mayo sandwich I have ever seen, three slices high packed with chicken. Had coffee on the outside rear deck before checking out on the hottest day of the year so far watching the cable car float over the Thames and swimmers in the dock water. Well recommend.",4,2017,04,11
119,Sunborn hotel ,Stay on the sunborn it was like staying on a cruise ship the room was lovely and the evening dinner was 1st class there was of us we all chose a different starter main and pudding and everyone said how delicious it was. Breakfast the next day was ine if tge best i have had 5*. The staff were outstanding the whole experience was well worth the stay.  ,5,2017,04,10
119,Very pleasant stay,"Came here for a night after an event at the Excel (which is just outside).

Very pleasant welcome on reception and the room was a good size with a river view.

A peaceful night sleep, enhanced by being a bit further out from London so less of the hussle and bussle outside.

And if you were wondering, we certainly didn't feel the boat moving.

Thanks for a great time.",4,2017,04,10
119,Amazing Anniversary Break,"My wife and I were treated to a stay for our 55th wedding  anniversary.   We were welcomed as soon as we entered the reception and our cases taken.  We were soon shown to our room and were amazed to find the hotel had upgraded us to a suite without being asked.  The service was impeccable, all the staff were very friendly and helpful, and everywhere was spotlessly clean.  The restaurant staff were attentive and the food was  equal to any top class hotel or cruise ship.  We enjoyed our stay so much and hope to return very soon.",5,2017,04,10
119,Lovely Wedding Aniversary break!,"I booked this Hotel as a Wedding Anniversary present for my husband. He loves the sea and I get se sick so this was my compromise. The weather in London was hot and sunny so when we arrived it looked breath taking. We checking in by a very lovely lady and stayed in cabin/room 2035. It felt we had just boarded a cruise. We had drink on the bar deck an enjoyed the view and sun. Later on we went for dinner where we had the most delicious sea bream fillet with lemon grass white sauce and muscles. For desert I had very chocolaty bavaroise that was perfect, not to sweet or dense with a vanilla scoop of ice cream and my husband had the lemon cheese cake. We sat on a table by the window an watched the sun set in the horizon. It was so romantic... The staff were all very attentive and discrete, extremely professional. They would top off our glasses without being intrusive and made sure we were having a good time.At the end of the meal the Chef had prepared us some lovely cupcake desert with a candle so we could have the perfect finish to a perfect day. The room was spacious and very clean, the bathroom was compact but the shower was terrific. 
In the morning we had a lovely breakfast, all items were good quality and you can have as much as you want. We checked-out feeling we could stay for longer and promising our selves we will come back soon.",5,2017,04,10
119,Affordable luxuary,"Lovely stay, staff very helpful and friendly. room supper, bed great to fall into after a long day in London. Breakfast filled us up ready for the next adventure. Easy to get to, right next to the cable car and would recommend.",5,2017,04,10
119,Wonderful 50th celebration at the Landsend Restaurant onboard the Sunborn yacht!,"The scenery, company, customer service and cuisine were all superb! I can honestly say that the Sunborn surpassed my expectations, especially with customer service (Dominic) and the chef and his beautiful cuisine. Service was efficient and staff were very personable.",5,2017,04,09
119,nice but not worth the money,we stopped here for a 20th anniversary asked for early check in and out 2 months before but they could not do it god know why one room come on . the staff are nice but drinks service is slow the rooms are ok but nothing special we had a deluxe   water side room which was £340 then I paid for  champagne rose petals and chocs  for £95 I expected more average champagne 4 chocs and fake rose petals . we then went to eat and only had one corse fish and beef and one drink each at a cost of £97  so as you can see for 20 hours on board at a cost of nearly £600 you can understand the disappointment I would suggest shopping about before booking as its not worth the silly price and they wont make the effort for you for a special occasions ,3,2017,04,09
119,We had a total relaxing evening staying on this beautiful yacht.,"Staff very good and polite, good service,had dinner in the restaurant, presentation of the food and taste was fantastic.Our thanks to Isabel,Gery and christina who look after us.
Will definitely be booking again.",5,2017,04,09
119,Lovely Night On The Suborn,"Just returned from a one night stay aboard the Sunborn London. Staff were really lovely and friendly, however service was a bit all over the place, due to the main bar area being booked out to a company that was hosting at the nearby Excel centre. Meaning we had to use the smaller Sky bar. Dinner was very nice, food great and room ideal (really large for a ships room). Would recommend a stay, but maybe for 1 night as there's not much to do onboard.",4,2017,04,08
119,Ships Ahoy,"What a stunning ship and a great location for meetings near docklands!

The ship is moored next to Excel centre with a short walk to the DLR and Cable Car to O2.

The ship is well presented with a beautiful reception area, nicely decorated bar and restaurant areas.

To rooms are well appointed and mine had a balcony, sofa and comfortable bed.

Food was very nice.

Happy to recommend!",5,2017,04,08
119,Birthday lunch ,"A lovely setting for a birthday lunch. Fantastic food and wine served by attentive staff. We had three courses from the set menu. This was good value and the sea bream was delightful,and even a surprise trio of birthday cakes beautifully presented also.",5,2017,04,07
119,Day trip lunch ,"When to the Sunbron for the lunch and must say better then expected had a great time and the food was amazing I will be back for a lunch again with my work friends and mates would also love to try the afternoon tea next as it looked amazing when it was being brought out.
Thank you to all staff ",5,2017,04,07
119,A different type of stay,"I really enjoyed my one night on the Sunborn yatch hotel.  I was with collegues and we had the bar menu, very tasty burgers! and not short on portions.  The bedroom was quality and had a balcony.  Really well fitted out.  I have booked my son in there at the end of April as he is at the O2 for a concert.  Looking forward to going back for breakfast",5,2017,04,06
119,Never 4 star,"Stayed just the one night for a concert, was quite happy with the hotel on arrival and location to 02 was pretty good. Room was bigger than I expected, bit dated but not a problem and was clean. So more than happy with everything until it came time to sleep. Ever tried sleeping in a sauna, me either till now. After getting into bed suddenly realised how hot I was, tried the air con made a noise but didn't really do anything. So had a cold shower and tried to sleep again, within minutes was far to hot. Finally realised it was the mattress, so started to look at what I thought was a mattress but it wasn't, i have no idea what it was and still don't . Was like a topper on a frame have never seen anything like it in my life. Worst night sleep I have ever had anywhere, the one thing anyone expect from a hotel is to sleep, regardless won't be back. It was freezing outside so god help anyone who stays there in summer",1,2017,04,05
119,"Sunborn Gibraltar and Sunborn London, both great!","

We stayed last summer at the Sunborn Yacht in Gibraltar and we had such a great time there, that my husband surprised me with a stay in London. 
He admitted, that he forgot to arrange a surprise for our Anniversary and the young friendly gentlemen at the Concierge desk rescued him. He booked an arrangement with rose petals and chocolates and one of the women who cleaned the rooms showed me how to fold a towel like a swan. We had dinner at the restaurant. It wasn’t cheap, but it was worth every penny, because it tasted so delicious. Really liked the plates on which they served the food and as a surprise we got a nice chocolate plate after the dinner. It would be great if Sunborn will have soon one more of these yachts in Europe, because it was such a fabulous experience for the second time. 

Food was fantastic, service was fantastic, staff were great especially the  reception girl  sorry didnt get her name who helped us with our flowers she was exceptional  that girl needs a reward she went above and beyond  a credit  to you

Atmosphere was very welcoming and service on highest standards.I had a lunch in restaurant and was spoiled with professional stuff and amazing food. Definitely will go there again when will visit London ",5,2017,04,05
119,Outstanding service!,"We can honestly say that Sunborn London is the one of the best places we stayed so far.
Welcoming smile at the check in, spacious rooms with luxurious Molton Brown toiletries, delicious dinner, mesmerizing views and most important professional and attentive service through the hotel.
It just makes you feel so special when all the staff greats you with the genuine smile and nothing is too much of a trouble.
Truly unique and impressive place to stay!",5,2017,04,04
119,Alternative to the hotels in Central London  ,"Just a quick note to compliment the hotel for the great time we had on the yacht.
Very clean hotel rooms – polite staff – we went to a musical in the West End and had a pre-theatre dinner, great value for money. We were lucky with the weather and a sunny Friday morning. They offer books in the guest rooms and I had one from Robert Edric in our room, which I read when I was a student. Some special memories came up – thanks for that.",5,2017,04,04
119,The hotel for fans of Molton Brown,"Because of the friendly staff at the reception we had a very pleasant stay. We were a group of ladies for a – girls’ night out. We had plenty of last minute request like flowers, balloons and some banners and nothing was too much to ask for. Being on a trip away from home and the household it was great to find a hotel room, which was so spotless. Very nice that they have Molton Brown products in the bathroom. The flower arrangement which they had in the lobby was amazing and I hope I will be successful to arrange something similar for my living room at home.
 
",5,2017,04,04
119,"Beautiful hotel, shame about the restaurant!","My partner and I stayed at the Sunborn for his birthday and what a beautiful hotel it is.  Something a little different away from the hustle and bustle of central London hotels, still with an incredible view of the city.  
We stayed in an executive room with a balcony which was perfect, bed extremely comfortable and everything very clean.
The only down side is the restaurant.  We initially asked to move our table half an hour later than we had booked, but were told they were fully booked. To then turn up and for the duration of the meal the restaurant was half full.  The whole room lacked atmosphere, no music and lighting quite bright.   
We had a bottle of wine, 2 main courses and 2 coffees which came to £150. The £34 steak tasted of...well absolutely nothing. And the green beans were so over powered by Red Onion they were unedible.  Service was incredibly slow. We left and went to the Westend and had a pizza.
Other than the restaurant, a stunning hotel!",4,2017,04,04
119,Wonderful Experience,"We had booked the hotel via a Groupon offer we got bed, breadsticks and an evening meal in the offer. We upgraded our room to a river view, the room was amazing a spacious with an excellent bathroom with a shower. The too had a Lavazza coffee machine and we got some complimentary chocs and water. The meal in the restaurant was to die for all well cooked and presented. The breakfast buffet was also really good with a wide selection to choose from, we definitely stay again. Highly recommended. The staff we all friendly polite and talkative without being intrusive. Beats staying in a land hotel any day.",5,2017,04,04
119,City Airport Hotel,"
 
City Airport hotel
 
That was my 3rd time staying on business at the yacht. It takes you less than 10 minutes by taxi to City Airport und you pay around £10. It cant be more convenient and the atmosphere in this hotel is so different to all the other hotels in London. Shouldn’t have shown the photos to my kids who want to stay there when we come over to London next time.

119,Fab stay!,"My husband treated me to a weekend in London and The Sunborn didn't disappoint! What a different experience to just staying on land. We thoroughly enjoyed the whole stay, room was airy and spacious, clean and comfortable.  The only down side for us was that try as we might we couldn't secure a table for dinner. However cocktails in the bar made up for that! We had both the lovely Gery and Christina serving us and you just couldn't wish for more of an excellent service. Gery was very knowledgeable, guiding us through the cocktail menu (all delicious may I add!) and Christina too. They were lovely waitresses and really made our evening!! Then onto breakfast which was great too. All in all a really fabulous stay.",4,2017,04,03
119,Something Different,We stayed here due to the ease for getting to the O2. The novelty also appealed of staying on a Yacht for the night. We booked a family room and on arrival the bed for my son was not made up no extra towels either we called reception who said this would be done later so as not to take up to much room in the cabin. We left the room and went for some food in the car the menu offers Sandwiches/Burgers simple food which we needed after a long drive. Service was really slow and the burgers were not pleasant my husband ordered the double chorizo burger which came with a slither of chorizo nothing else? We approached the waiter who advised there is no burger with it? Rather odd none the less the burger was refunded also was my sons which was cold in the middle. After returning from the event at the O2 circa 11.15 with a tired child we went back to our room no bed no towel.... once again had to go and ask reception. In the meantime my son had to sleep on a sofa in the bar area. We tried snacks again this time Croque Monsieur and Fries sadly once again something so simple tasted disgusting. Food was once again left and we were told it would be rectified when we checked out. When we left the next day I advised the manager and she gave me £11 off for some apple juice my son had had that morning and an upgrade if we stayed again. Although a nice offer not sure we will be rushing back. If you want a simple room close to Excel and O2 then this will suffice. ,3,2017,04,02
119,Cooked alive !,"On arriving at the Sunborn we noted our room was incredibly hot so turned the air con on , the temperature was showing 24 degrees .... pretty stiffling !                                  after unpacking we went to the bar for a drink as the room was still uncomfortably hot but on our return it hadn't cooled at all . We were going out for the evening so reported the issue to front desk and asked that the problem be dealt with while we were out. To cut a long story the issue was never dealt with , no one even attempted to do a thing about it. we returned to the sunborn late and went to bed only to wake in the early hours with a splitting headache  ( we hadn't drank more then a couple of coronas so no, not a hangover ) and feeling like we were being cooked alive. After again calling front desk and being informed that there were no rooms free to move us to ( like we really wanted to be moving at 4am ! )..... the temperature by this time had risen to 26 degrees.  Eventually they found another room to move us to , miraculously considering they couldn't find a spare room earlier , how do you lose a room on a yacht?..... a 500 bed hotel maybe but on a yacht?                                        The attitude of the front of house staff on the Sunborn leaves alot to be desired , we felt they just really couldnt be bothered and really didnt care either.                                Come on Sunborn , sort out your air con .... this was February  what the hell will it be like in July !",1,2017,04,01
119,Beautiful hotel ,"Hotel was lovely, the staff were very friendly and the room was magnificent. The view from the hotel I would definitely recommend it. I have nothing bad  to say about the hotel wish I stayed longer I will be back though ",5,2017,04,01
119,A Real Touch of Class,"We were celebrating our birthdays by staying for a couple of nights in London, etc. The first night was at the Sunborn and included dinner and breakfast and was every bit as good as we had hoped. There is an overall level of efficiency and friendliness that adds to the enjoyment greatly. Service in both bar and restaurant was superb and we will be very happy to return.",5,2017,04,01
119,Convenient location for visiting the O2,Booked this place for a sleepover following a concert at the O2.  Really easy to get to and an overall pleasant experience.  Only gripes was the lack of speed to serve us in the very quiet bar - 15 minute wait to be served for one Perroni and two glasses of tap water (we spotted at least 4 staff) and a complete lack of service for breakfast.  Improve the service and this place could be top notch.,3,2017,04,01
119,More than five star,"From the moment we arrived at reception I knew we had chosen the right place. Estella and her colleague on reception greeted us with smiles on their faces and even though we had a small problem with the booking this was sorted immediately by Estella. The Hotel is immaculately kept in all areas and both the breakfast and evening meal were most enjoyable. All the staff are friendly, helpful and courteous whether on duty or not. Check out is not till midday but as our flight home till 8pm they offer a free storage and changing facility. On returning to collect our baggage my Grandson wanted to charge his iPhone but had packed his cable. Estella offered to charge it for him with her own personal cable which I thought was a really nice touch. Will definitely return.",5,2017,03,31
119,An amzing place to stay!,"Great stay experience. Staff very accommodating and friendly. The continental breakfast is great. There is a wonderful variety of breakfast items. Amazing view.
Would definitely stay again! Highly recommend!",5,2017,03,31
119,All round excellent weekend.,"Room had the wow factor, facing the Thames. Excellent service at reception. Bar service was good, could of been a bit quicker. Restaurant food was excellent. Well worth the visit, all the staff very friendly..",5,2017,03,31
119,not bad,"nice room, good size, well cleaned, good facilities, staff friendly and helpful, good view across the water. Good for novelty value but a bit out of the way, not much around the area. Good value for London.",4,2017,03,30
119,Not quite the jolly sailor I wanted to be.,"On Arrival, the Sunborn Yacht looked amazing docked in the midday sun. Walking into the reception area our first impression was really very positive and the staff were very helpful.  Our cabin one floor below decks and very spacious.  After settling in we had a closer look at the room and found it to be showing signs of age! The carpet had several stains and the cabin was somewhat dated.  It was very clean.  The air conditioning did not work and the cabin was very hot with no opening window.  We suffered the first night!  We had asked reception to have it looked at, but nothing was done.  We had a very good and plentiful breakfast in the morning. Again the staff were very attentative. Out for day. Back in the evening. Still very hot in the room. We booked a table for an evening meal. Promptly shown to our table. Unfortunately the meal was very slow arriving and was of a mediocre quality, but really quite expensive.  I was expecting much better for the price. The facilities are very basic.  The food and drinks are rather expensive and the yacht is quite tired. Apart the customer service (which is exceptional) I was dissapointed and would not stay there again,  It is quite a distance from central london as well.  Around £25 by taxi and over £30 (for two) each way by the Docklands Railway.",3,2017,03,30
119,Nice but not great!,"Nice hotel with great rooms,attentive staff but what lets it down is its breakfast. I may be being too critical but for the price you pay surely they could deliver warm toast to your table. No instead you have to make it yourself with the toaster on the side. Isn't that what you would expect from hotels at the other end of the market. Cmon guys this can't be too difficult to fix",4,2017,03,29
119,Work Meeting,"Had the pleasure of having my work meeting on the Sunborn Yacht yesterday. First impressions were amazing- reception team very welcoming and friendly, all the cleaners said hello and ask how we were. The food was amazing and we were again looked after by amazing staff, I would recommend using the Sunborn for kind of meetings or social events. Well done to all the team at the Sunborn",5,2017,03,29
119,Excellent service,"We visited the Sunborn yesterday evening and had booked an area in the bar, the service was above and beyond. Julian provided his services for the evening, he was very attentive, thank you Julian for the amazing service.",5,2017,03,29
119,Rest weekend and it did just that,"Took the wife out for a treat, this is always my first pick on a place to stay love taken my wife here every time we go the service is one of the best, and love the views looking over London and O2 

The food was amazing as always we had the 3 course meal at night 
then breakfast in the morning, was well needed after a night in London

this place is easier then you think to get to traveling is just a tube stop away and around a 5 min walk 

We find the team always go out there way for you to make sure your stay is great can not wait to go back",5,2017,03,28
119,Let us enjoy life - break on Sunborn,"A wonderful unique experience - One night stay - with dinner and breakfast.
Stay in the executive suite with a balcony - walked out and felt the cool breeze and enjoyed the calmness of the river.
The room was cosy and wonderfully furnished with a delightful  ambiance - It made us forget that we were in the heart of London 
Staff were Curtious and helpful - dinner and breakfast were deliously prepared. 
Only disappointment was when we had to leave. Great unique experience - So we are back again in a couple of week - A hidden gem in the heart of London - Without a doubt one of the best in the city.",5,2017,03,28
119,Mothers day afternoon tea,"After being told i could not ammend my booking from 4 people to 6 people only to find we were like the only people in the restaurant. Was not happy. We waited a while even tho there was no1 else there before we were seen to. Everyone was busy cleaning,stocking everything but being attentive to us. The place is lovely but some staff may need training. Sandwiches wer soggy i was in shock to find this that we had been given unfresh sandwiches. Now this whole afternoon tea is £26 per person id say well worth it IF food is fresh but clearly it wasnt this day. ",2,2017,03,28
119,Birthday break on Sunborn,"My parents and I returned again and stayed in an Executive Suite for 2 nights to celebrate my 51st birthday on 23rd March after celebrating my 50th birthday on the Sunborn Yacht Hotel last year.

Our room was excellent as usual, very clean and well equipped. We had breakfast and bar snacks during our stay which were very nice and my mum was looked after very well with her dietary needs as she has a wheat and gluten intolerance.
The staff in the lounge bar brought over a lovely surprise on my birthday of a grey slate with Happy Birthday written on it in raspberry sauce with white chocolate truffles and dried fruits. It was totally unexpected and a lovely surprise.

One of the big plus points of staying at the Sunborn Yacht Hotel are the staff. All are friendly and very helpful but a special mention must go to Isabel Cozmin Nocosae and a lovely helpful young gentleman Vadim on Reception. Both helped make our stay a very pleasant one.

We look forward to returning to the Sunborn Yacht Hotel later this year for another break which we have already booked.",5,2017,03,26
119,50th birthday break,"We arrived on the Sunday afternoon for a mini break for my 50th birthday.
The sight of the yacht was to say the least impressive.
We went to the reception area to book in and were dealt with efficiently and friendly.
We were checked in, but the receptionist went above and beyond just checking us in. She asked if we were planning anything special during our visit. My partner mentioned we were celebrating my 50th and were due to have lunch at the Savoy. We were then offered a free glass of champagne to celebrate my birthday, which was a nice gesture.
We made our way to our room / cabin and was very impressed. The cabin was spacious and very cosy.
The location was perfect out the way of the hustle and bustle of central London. So peaceful and relaxing.
Overall a fantastic experience and will be back again. some time in the future.",5,2017,03,26
119,Fabulous!,"Literally laughing at the last few bad reviews!! My husband and I stayed here on a Friday 24th March and have had the most amazing time! We upgraded to an executive room which was well worth it! Gorgeous room, lush balcony and the Prosecco wasn't too bad either! Nice Molten Brown bathroom products!!. All of the staff were friendly, chatty and helpful, the restaurant food was absolutely delicious and because we had the sense to book a table we didn't have any problem being seated!..... the views from the front of the restaurant at night are great! Amazing stay, something a little different great for a cheeky night away! No screaming kids, chavs, red wine on the carpet or people running up and down the corridors in sight!! Brilliant night away! Xxxxx ",5,2017,03,25
119,Dissatisfied ,Me and my girlfriend  stayed here on 22nd March it wasn't worth the money tbh staff down stairs in bar was lovely but  the staff on reception  didn't say we had to book for restaurant  upstairs we was turned away twice now really they should put quests in ready for meals we had to eat in the bar now for a 5 star hotel we expected more but  we had better service other hotels we was dissatisfied  with the arrangement  also in a place like that you should have music playing live it felt rather boring for both of us ,3,2017,03,24
119,Ok for Chavs,"Room with a view was the best thing about our stay and the friendly staff. This tries to portray a high quality venue. Bedroom still had Valentine petals on the floor in March! Self service Breakfast, had to ask 3 times for food to be replenished.  Cold plates made food cold very quickly. Our romantic night was spoilt by kids running up and down the corridor and in the room above us. Child in high chair cried and screamed all through our breakfast. Kids and Chavs should be banned from this venue if they want to make it an impressive place to stay.  Never going there again.",3,2017,03,22
119,Fantastic views,"We visited the Sunborn a couple of weeks ago whilst on business at the ExCel. It's a great meeting point and offers fantastic views over the Thames and is literally within a stones throw from ExCel. I thought the drinks would be super expensive however they were pretty sensibly priced with the added bonus of the odd amuse bouche from the waiters (steak and chicken skewers) would definitely recommend, my only regret was not staying longer.  ",4,2017,03,21
119,Wedding Anniversary ,"I'm only giving this 3* cause of the morning call we received about check out at 11 when clearly our email said 12pm, me & my wife was not very pleased & received no apology at reception what so ever but got told that you got some promotional deal that lets you check out at 12. If that's the case & you knew why would you then call us to tell us that check out is at 11 & we overdue?! 

Anyway besides that, this hotel is absolutely fabu! The moment you walk outside you are amazed by the size, you don't feel it rocking or anything. The experience was amazing & for the price was totally worth it. My wife was absolutely over the moon with the surprise. The night team are awesome & I love how up to date it is with tech as you could order room service through the tablet. Also most hotels only have like 6 channels but they had alarmist every free view channel available so that was fantastic. 

WORTH A STAY IF YIU THINKING ABOUT IT. ",3,2017,03,21
119,Lovely stay,"Really nice hotel, friendly staff, great cocktails. Large, clean room with all required facilities. A little bit out of the way for a London weekend away. 3 mile walk to Canary Wharf but hey we need the exercise!  Would go again but in better weather (if possible).",4,2017,03,21
119,Pamper retreat ,"My husband and I spent a night here . Everything was fantastic, food was succulent , bed so comfy.  Even though we missed our massage session . It was still great . Will definitely visit again. Will visit with the kids in summer .",5,2017,03,21
119,Weekend Getaway ,"Exactly what we wanted, rooms very spacious and clean. Staff were very welcoming and answered all our questions. Had dinner in the Lands End restaurant on board you need to book in advance as can be very busy at times. Cocktails in the bar are a little pricey but really nice atmosphere, would go again.",4,2017,03,20

Great location, very friendly staff especially Lena the receptionist.
Catered for the children as well as us adults.

We will definitely return.",5,2017,03,20
119,A great place to stay,Me and my wife stayed here for a night. From the time we got there to the time we left was absolutely brilliant. The staff are so helpful and do their upmost for you throughout your stay. We would highly recommended the sunbuorn and are definitely going to go back.,5,2017,03,20
119,Strictly,We would like to applaud the sunborn hotel yacht in london for providing a couple of memorable days. Our thanks go in particular to Maryiam Tahir for her dedication. Also for brilliant service Isabel and Alessandro who enhanced our stay with they smiles and  dedication.,5,2017,03,19
119,great  hotel and so nice,"this hotel is posh but so wellcoming and the power shower in the rooms was so good.
the view  from the bar is nice also .

breakfast is  good but is  a lot of money is nice for a  treat took my  mom for  afternoon tea also  was not nice",5,2017,03,19
119,"A beautiful hotel, full of character.","The room was spacious, well-equipped & very clean. Breakfast was good with plenty of choice & the kitchen was happy to provide poached eggs instead of scrambled or fried. Food in the bar was also good, but although the service was helpful & friendly it was a bit slow & the drinks were pricey. There is a good range of cocktails, and you couldn't ask for a better view! 
We stayed 3 nights for C2C at the O2 and the hotel was very convenient, 10 minutes on the Emirates Airline or 3 stops on the train.",5,2017,03,18
119,Different and a little odd,"Having landed at City airport with 2 colleagues we received an unsurprisingly disappointed response from the black cab we got into for the 10 minute drive! He dropped us off near by but did not know how to get to the boat.  Suggest you take clear directions. 
We received a pleasant welcome and went to our cabins. The room was a lot bigger than I expected. The finish is a little dated and a bit tired but equally that gives it character, although the stained carpet was a little too much (more later). I found the bathroom small compared to the room size and very claustrophobic  with a self closing door.  After a brief shower you find yourself in a steam room! 
The ship as a whole is smaller than I expected, with limited choice on food.  The bar menu is mainly burgers with limited seating, so we tried the main restaurant for a quick meal.  Despite having plenty of tables they would not let us have a table for 30 minutes as they had two other tables they were waiting for their guests to arrive.  In the interest of time we headed back to the bar.  The staff were helpful and got additional chairs so we could sit down. At that point the receptionist who had checked me in kindly asked how my room was.  I explained the stains on the carpet which looked like blood and she laughed and said it was probably red wine. No apology - Odd reaction! The bar food (burgers) was good.
It was a different experience and worth doing once, but not sure I would rush back.",3,2017,03,18
119,"Lovely, will be returning ","Visited here for my wife's birthday and was very impressed. The area around the yacht was very quiet and had a relaxing feel about it. 
On board the staff were very nice and friendly, room was nice and spacious with a huge bed. Would like to visit here in the summer as I can imagine it's nice to eat out on the deck with the sun out.
Breakfast is pretty expensive but was nice. 
Will definitely try again. ",5,2017,03,18
119,Different ,"Rather expensive 
But worth doing once to try 
Room nice 
Drinks mega expensive 
But really good view in bar
Would I stay again 
Probably 
But the place looks like it could do with some updating 
Staff are good ",3,2017,03,17
119,Impressive,"Yacht is beautiful !!! When you book in the Foyer is breath taking. Room was spotless and very large. Food lovely and cocktails, but usual London prices. Staff in reception a little difficult to understand but very polite and friendly.  

Excellent transport link a 5 min walk away from dock, Em airline cheap and a great way to get to O2 arena.  Watch Uber taxi  they are a big disappointment, charged £5.00 for their driver to cancel our booking while we knocked on his window.",5,2017,03,16
119,"Swanky, Lovely Staff, Out of this world","What can I say? The one night I stayed here for my 21st birthday was amazing. The staff went above and beyond and thought about all the finer details. Once I checked in, the staff gave me all the information I needed to log in to the wifi, told me what to do if I needed help and let me know where everything is. I went out that night for dinner but once i got back found a hand written letter and a slate of handmade chocolate truffles on the table in my room. The room looked out over the dock which was beautiful and is close to the emerates cable car so it is easy to get around. The bar was gorgeous and the breakfast on point. The room was luxurious and spacious, the biggest bed I have ever slept in. Very clean everywhere and all round a fabulous experience. Definitely will go again.",5,2017,03,16
119,Great Place to Stay!,"Loved being on the river so close to fantastic places to eat and visit! Parked about 7 minutes away on someone's drive for much less than any car park at Excel. Our room was lovely, plenty of space, lovely bathroom products only complaint was there wasn't a proper extractor in the bathroom so it became extremely hot and steamy and as you can't open a window in the room it was impossible to have any fresh air in the room. Can't imagine what it is like in the warmer months unless you want the constant noise of the aircon.
I was put off by comments on travel sites about the restaurant so we ate out and there were plenty of places to go. Also, just a ten minute walk to the Emirates cable car which was well worth the trip on a clear night!",4,2017,03,15
119,Lovely hotel ,"Lovely hotel stuff very welcoming,
Lovely view,room was lovely had massage treatment,does feel like you are on a yacht
Would differently recommend this hotel more for couples then with kids,
Would go back train station close by and lots of restaurants to dine,
02 arena not to far away can get bit cold in the evening.",5,2017,03,14
119,Out of this world,"Well, what can I say...  apart from amazing.
We stayed in a standard room, but it was more like a luxurious room. Very spacious, clean and tidy.
Food was good, drinks were slightly on the expensive side, and a hefty service charge!!!! 
Breakfast was really nice with choices to suite every need.
The final night of our stay, we decided to have a few drinks in the bar, the staff were very polite and helpful...   Cozmin was our waiter, and was very polite and was very helpful, we even taught him some Welsh sayings..  ""iechyd Da"" Cozmin lol 
We would certainly stay there again, it was in a quiet part of London, so we had no issues with traffic noise or clubbing noise.. 
I would certainly recommend this lovely hotel.",5,2017,03,14
119,Great weekend,"We were greeted by friendly attentive staff at reception and had a lovely room with balcony. The yacht was close to the emirates cable car which was excellent for crossing the river whist taking in fabulous views. Breakfast the next morning was relaxed,well cooked and had a good selection.",5,2017,03,14
119,Afternoon Tea ,"After being to the Sunborn many times for dinner, I thought that I would try something new and bring my partner for afternoon tea for her birthday. The service had always been amazing and I was expecting no less than this when we turned up yesterday. However, the experience wasn't one I would return for. When I made the reservation, I mentioned that we were celebrating a special occasion, to which was not acknowledged. The sandwiches were not what I expected from a prestigious and one of a kind hotel. We ordered one of each menu, ""traditional under the sea"" & ""under the sea"" to which the only difference was one had more sea type fillings (crab, prawn etc). When it came it looked pretty on the stand, however, we soon came to realise that the bread was soggy and the cucumber sandwiches tasted like water. We had to ask for more sandwiches rather than being offered them and once we were finished we were sat with empty plates for at least 30 minutes before I attracted the waitress. Unfortunately, we will not be returning to a place in which we recommended to so many. ",3,2017,03,13
119,Amazing as ever,"Had a different room this time, a river view with a balcony. Was lucky enough to have some sunshine and was able to sit out there which was lovely.

Room large with coffee machine, tea, hot choc and kettle and bed very comfortable. 

Breakfast was great and they had gluten free options of toast and cereal so along with the fresh fruit I came away very full.

Staff were marvelous as usual, nothing is too much trouble for them. Andrea included in this great crowd.",5,2017,03,13
119,Afternoon Tea,"This was a treat for my partner and I.
It was the highlight of our day out.
The boat is beautiful, although the enterance is a little confusing.
The reception area is amazing and took us by surprise.
Staff were very helpful and professional.
Tea was delightful and we have uploaded pictures to our Facebook accounts, friends are now asking for details so they too can book this lovely experience.",5,2017,03,13
119,Gorgeous luxurious and unique stay!,"My boyfriend and I stayed here for our 3 year anniversary. Firstly, I have to say the interior is stunning, with a very calm and beautiful vibe going on. The reception staff were very polite and helpful and made us feel nicely welcomed.

Our room was lovely, looking out to the river. Bed was very big and comfortable, and the decoration of the room was very nice and modern. 

Breakfast in the morning was also very nice, good choices of food and a nice comfortable atmosphere to enjoy whilst eating.

Overall, this hotel was a beautiful experience for us, something quite unique and luxurious but quite pricey! 

I would recommend this to people for the experience.",5,2017,03,12
119,Great weekennd,"We stayed at Sunborn London for the weekend for my partners 40th birthday. We stayed as 2 adults and a 13 year old child.
Check in was very straight forward. We had an executive family room. Breakfast was very good & reasonably priced. We had drinks in the bar on the Saturday night, the service was very good. The whole hotel is very clean & well presented. My partner really liked the Molton Brown toiletries. There was a small issue with the heating which was stuck on heat, on the Friday night, this was resolved by the time we arrived back on Saturday afternoon. Check out was equally as easy, with the credit card details held on file with the receipt emailed to me.
One note; CUSTOM HOUSE DLR station is closed until Dec 2017. Others are a 10 minute walk away.",5,2017,03,12
119,A very nice hotel indeed. ,Had three day here whilst at an exhibition at Excel and it is definitely the best hotel I have stayed at in this area over the years.  Very clean and well laid out room I had booked an Executive King and was very pleased with it. All the facilities were fantastic and both food and service was excellent. Would definitely recommend. ,5,2017,03,11
119,Unique London hotel experience ,"We stayed here to give some visiting overseas guests a different perspective of staying in London .
They were absolutely blown away by staying the night on a super yacht in London .
The hotel is unique , very impressive  as you approach , stunning in the public areas and the cabin rooms we upgraded to have a water view , flat screen to , Samsung tablet , coffee maker , bathroom , shower , wardrobes and king bed .. 
You could be in any decent 4 star quality hotel room but adding in the yacht experience makes it a 5 star stay for sure .
We parked for £15 in the multi-storey 2 mins walk away and the car was safe and secure .
We took a cab into Canary Wharf to Goodman steak house for a top meal and had cocktails on deck in the Sunborn lounge looking at the nighttime view of the East London skyline  .. very memorable and top marks to the Sunborn ! ",5,2017,03,11
119,Kitsch But Low Quality,"It's a kitsch hotel and offers a unique format in hotel. We went for the weekend for a London meeting. We paid a discount rate so we were placed in the lower deck facing the dock wall, which is fair enough. However upon opening our curtains, we saw a large amount of rubbish floating outside our window (we were at water level). We asked to switch rooms. The manager gave us two option. Pay for an upgrade or move down the same corridor facing the same way. It did not solve the problem. We didn't feel we should pay more to not have a view of rubbish (pic posted). I also told her that moving down the corridor was a fruitless endeavor as the current is moving and the rubbish floats back and forth, therefore pointless to move. She should have moved our outlook for no up charge or sent someone out there with a net to clean out the rubbish. Both suggestions denied. She insisted that the rubbish wouldn't move as in her three years there, there was no current... so moving down the corridor would solve the problem. I actually laughed at that.",1,2017,03,11
119,Lovely hotel,"Amazingly done, very clean etc, weird feeling that your actually on a boat, rooms quite small but clean
Staff ok but wanting service charge on everything is a bit much specially as it is not cheap for drinks aboard",4,2017,03,10
119,A Happy time. ,"We arranged to have lunch on the Sunborn for my partners birthday. You have two options the set meal or the al a carte. Both menus have a good selection of fish, meat and veggie. All the meals were great, the pork belly was good, but we would have preferred the cracklings to be crispy, as it was soft. But that's personal preference. The deserts were good too although the cheese & biscuits was a bit lack lustre. We had champagne, wine and were offered the cocktail menu. We ordered 3 cocktails, none of which were great, we told the waiter z and he replied by saying , I don't drink cocktails and never made them. Ok so we just laughed and drank them. We then went to the bar downstairs and had quiet a few drinks Isabella was very attentive and served us all night. The drinks are expensive but they are doubles. I booked a room at the last minute also a bit expensive, but you are paying for a great location and it's easy to get around  london from here and next to the excel centre.  A great room, it was very clean and had everything we needed and great view of london. All in all a great experience and we would go back again.",4,2017,03,09
119,Stunning all round service and rooms but cant remember much was drunk and probably didnt make most of unique experience!,"Amazing facilites, great rooms - very luxurious. Great breathtaking enterance and great location. Although expensive for bar drinks ( bring own) all round nice experience but i probably dint make the most of it as i was really drunk... From what i can remember beautiful.",4,2017,03,09
119,Great place to stay,"I booked this hotel as a treat and we were not let down.

The reception staff were proffessioal caring and knowledgeable and both booking in and out was a very smooth process.

The room was very spacious clean and comfortable.  And the amenities were ok only very small disappointment was that there was not enough milk provided although im sure if we had asked for more it would not have been a problem.

The ensuite facilities very clean with copious amounts of hot water and clean towels.

The bar area was easy to use and had great views the first coctails were great however due to staff change the ones on the second night were very plain an unexciting to the taste buds and the presentation of the coctails on the second night was very drab.

Now we come to the restaurant this gets a massive 10 out of ten

Be ware you have to book tables in advance.

The waitresses caroline and iesa were very proffesional and the other resturaunt staff all worked as a team.

The food was first class so compliments to the chiefs and their team.

The presentation of the food was very eye catching and the tastes set the taste buds on fire.

The location of the hotel was within a 2 miniute walk of the excel centre.

Overall a great time was had.

We would recommend this hotel not just for its confortable surroundings but for its excellent service and food",4,2017,03,09
119,Lovely hotel,Hotel room and staff amazing .our 25th anniversary picked this lovely hotel just had that little twist very good to getting to all the tourist sites the only thing that let it down for us was the cost to eat on the yacht would have liked to had a nice meal in the restaurant but working it out would have cost £120 that's with out a nice bottle or wine stopped in the bar nice to have table service but again very expensive for a drink bottle of beer £5 glass of wine £8 didn't bother lots of bars and restaurants in the area really nice ones and at half the price.id definitely would stay at the sunborn again just ashame about price of the food as I say hotel/ staff/ rooms 10/10,4,2017,03,08
119,Nice hotel very comfy bed,"Stayed here 2 nights Sunday Monday B and B breakfast lovely no shortage of food room adequate lovely king size bed and 2 feather pillows shower but no bath in our room. 
One drink at the bar a little expensive but well served and presented 
Went out for dinner nearby there are a few restaurants around 
Would recommend for short break",4,2017,03,07
119,For people who like boats that dont move! ;-),"I had the pleasure of staying on the Sunborn London Yacht hotel for my birthday.  The reception area is adorned with a massive chandelier and 2 sweeping staircases. The staff on reception are very polite and helpful.

My mum and I shared a ""classic"" cabin with oval porthole and I was very surprised by the size.  As you came in through the door, you had a wardrobe/cupboard to the left and your bathroom to the right.  The bathroom was really good size and consisted of a nice large shower, standard toilet and sink.  It came equipped with free mini shampoo/conditioner and shower gel along with shower cap.

Our room consisted of a queen size bed in the first section and in the end half of the room, a 2 seater sofa, coffee table and a tv unit which also held then fridge (2 complimentary bottles of water) and the tea/coffee facilities.  Opposite the bed, there was a huge mirrored wall.  There were enough sockets around to plug everything in and some of them I believe were also foreign sockets. There was also a Samsung tablet which mum and I used to watch a film.

We enjoyed a drink in the bar and thought £9 for a prosecco was around average for this kind of place.  The cocktails whilst a little more expensive were really rather strong and very tasty.  We got free peanuts on the first night, but when we visited the following day we were charged.

The restaurant is nice, but it was empty on the day we had lunch.  The staff are all very polite and will give recommendations regarding the food or the wine if you required.  I thought that the menu lacked a little variety and didn't have a great abundance on offer.  However, the quality and the taste of the food was lovely, but I thought a small bowl of pumpkin risotto @ £20 was a little bit pricey.  The saviour however whilst expensive @ £10 was the sticky toffee pudding.  It was gorgeous.

We also had a treatment during our visit and whilst the spa section is a little small, it offers a good choice of treatments and the girls that were working that day, were really nice and friendly.  We were only supposed to be there for half hour for our pedicure, but instead we got a full hour.  

Whilst I wouldn't run back next week to the Sunborn, it would be a great place to take someone special for a special treat.  

The cabin had aircon which I did have to put on in the night, as the it got really quite stuff in there.",4,2017,03,06
119,Excellent service!,"Feel compelled to write this review before even departing! I work in Hotels myself so always feel more judgmental! Cannot fault this hotel at all. It was my sons birthday and he had some handmade Chocolates in our room on arrival with a personal welcome letter wishing him a happy birthday. Drinks are a little on the expensive side but the service we received by both Cozmin and Jay made the cost worthwhile! Will definitely be returning, maybe just me and the husband next time! ",5,2017,03,05
119,Unique experience ,"This hotel is distinct in its nature. You spend your time in London while you are on the river. A unique experience that should be encountered. However, its rooms are not that luxurious and its location is somewhat far from the centre of London (you have to start from the DLR)",4,2017,03,05
119,Lovely staff but average facilities,We visited the hotel overnight to watch the David haye vs Tony bellew fight. The hotel looks amazing when you arrive but the inside is tired with carpet in the bar having lifted and creased. Our room was a good size and clean but the bathroom was again tired the toilet leaked all night and had a huge crack in the pan. For the cost I expected more. But the staff were very friendly and helpful we got stuck at the o2 due to the cable car closing at 11pm and they kindly sorted a car to collect us. So thank you for that.,3,2017,03,05
119,Great Customer Service and Amazing Hotel,"Stayed here for one night to go to an exhibition at the ExCel Centre and didn't realise how close we'd actually be to it! First impressions of the ship is the size of it, using the elevator to get to the reception the grand stair case as you enter tells you this is a very upmarket hotel, as soon as we checked in we were looked after excellently, the room was big and very well looked after, we stayed on the bottom deck facing the ExCel Centre so not really much of a view but if you head to the bar like we did the view of Canary Wharf and the Cable Cars covers the skyline from the back of the ship... we had a couple of cocktails which the first ones we had were very strong, however the second one which was a chocolatey mint one was the one we loved the most... we stayed in the bar for about an hour or so occasionally nipping out onto the deck, as more people checked in the staff we quick to kindly ask people to move from our table as we stood outside which was a nice touch and shows the little touches in customer service which adds to the experience... we decided to eat out as by time we arrived the restaurant was fully booked which we weren't bothered about as it gave us chance to explore London for a couple of ours and using the cable cars to head to Greenwich. When we arrived back about half 10 at night we headed to the room to settle down for the night, due to being smokers we headed out a few more times before finally settling in for the night, when we actually got into bed around 2am we realised we couldn't actually change the temperature of the room and found it really warm and hard to sleep, however once we explained to the staff on check out they refunded us half the price on the room which wasn't what we was looking for but were happy and proved yet again that customer satisfaction and customer service was their number one priority... thank you Sunborn for a great experience and I will definitely be staying here again and for longer, I will be recommending this hotel to all my friends and family who visit London.",5,2017,03,04
119,Lovely experience,"We had a lovely night away on the Sunborn Yacht Hotel.  The room was a good size and we had a lovely river view.  Tv, mini fridge, safe, tea and coffee, air conditioning and wifi all availanle in the room.  Dinner in Landsend restaurant was very nice too. Not a massive choice but we both enjoyed what we had with views looking out to emirates cable car and docklands.  Breakfast was also very nice and had plenty of choice. We visited the bar after dinner which was very pleasant, comfortable and relaxed witn table service.  All staff were very pleasant and accommodating. The Yacht is located next door to the Excel Exhibition centre and is within easy reach of The O2 Arena via cable car and DLR stations.",5,2017,03,04
119,Nice Different Hotel,"Fantastic location if you're going to the O2, a little out of London centre if not.  The hotel was perfectly clean and they allowed us to check in early which was good. All round a good experience at a reasonable price.",4,2017,03,04
119,Good for staying and entertaining!,"We hosted a meet and greet event for customers in the bar area. The team was excellent - Jay, Gery and Alex were helpful and very pleasant, service was smooth, and the food was tasty. It was a bit chilly to take full advantage of the lovely outdoor spaces, but the views from the deck outside the bar are lovely.

Quite a novel experience, conveniently located just outside the Excel Centre.",5,2017,03,03
119,Visit o2 ,"The hotel is lovely staff very friendly could not do enough for you. We had a twin room with large porthole not facing the river but room was lovely and clean had everything you could of needed we had room service which was really nice, if visiting o2 arena be aware the price for two bottles of wine in vip lounge was £72 which we thought was a total rip off. Make the most of the yacht was fantastic. Would return again ",5,2017,03,01
119,Birthday,Really lovely hotel was all original and very lush we really enjoyed our stay here and had an amazing riverside view we would definitely stay here again.   Staff were very friendly and helpful plenty of restaurants around as well all good value for money,5,2017,03,01
119,Very different hotel.,Great hotel very clean large rooms coffee and tea facility in room. little out of the way. Ideal if you was to visit the o2 or the excel. Breakfast was a little disappointing small selection and most items you had to ask for because none left. But when asked it was refilled.,4,2017,03,01
119,Disgusting Experience,"My daughter and I stayed one night on Sunday, 26th February 2017 for a girlie evening before attending The Beauty Show at the Excel the next day.  By the time we reached home on Monday afternoon my daughter had received an email accusing us of stealing a blanket from the room and taking £75 from her bank account! No phone call to ask us to check if we had picked it up by accident - they just took the money from her account which made her go overdrawn which has now incurred a £25 charge.  So now this blanket that we don't have has cost us £100.  I immediately called the hotel and the only person available to speak to was the telephone operator who told me that CCTV footage would be checked (this rang alarm bells - CCTV in bedrooms??) and that somebody would call me back once it had been checked.  Nobody called back so I called yesterday morning and spoke to a manager who said he would check with housekeeping and that there was no CCTV footage to check - so I was told a complete lie.  He then called me back and said that housekeeping had confirmed that the blanket was in a drawer when we checked in the room.  My daughter and I didn't even open the drawers!! We only used the wardrobe and left the rest of our belongings in our case.  Obviously another lie.  These people have called us thieves and liars and all they can say is that it is ""their procedure"".  Please, please think twice before you decide to stay at this hotel - their customer service is disgusting and they completely ruined my daughter and my evening/day together.",1,2017,03,01
119,Stunning stay & perfect for couples.,"Visited as a Christmas present, greeted professionally by the front desk. Decor in the lobby is a bit 70's but still very lovely and clean. Rooms were the same, very clean and luxurious. Stunning view from our balcony helped by lovely weather. 

Enjoyed prosecco in the VIP lounge with stunning views of the 02 and Canary Wharf as the sunset. To our embarrassment we accidentally smashed a glass whilst enjoying the view and the clear up was no problem at all.  

Buffet style breakfast was really tasty and plenty of choice. 

Had drinks in the bar after dinner, £28 for two drinks which was slightly on the pricey side and neither of us really enjoyed the cocktails, but that was down to personal preference. 

Had such a nice time we didn't want to leave! Only gave 4 stars for sleep quality due to the air con going from 19c to 24c during the night, might have been our error though.",5,2017,02,27
119,Beautiful but just expected a little more ,"While there's no question it's a beautiful boat, great location (we were at Excel during the day), and the reviews are very complimentary, due to the price point I just expected more, particularly in the service 

Had it beef half the price I'd have given them 5 stars be here and now paying what I did I wasn't blown away ",4,2017,02,26
119,Evening experience,Hubby and I had an evening meal and the whole experience was a delight.  The yacht is fabulous with a winding stairway which is awesome. The restaurant is on the upper deck and the view across the Docklands was beautiful.  The staff were very attentive and the food was just amazing.  It was a highlight experience.,5,2017,02,26
119,Lovely Hotel,"Visited the hotel for a night with my boyfriend and it was so lovely. The staff were very friendly, the room was beautiful and spacious, the view from the room was lovely...the breakfast buffet was amazing as it had great variety!! All in all I'd say our experience was Amazing! 
",5,2017,02,26
119,Excellent place near the O2 arena,"We stayed at the hotel for two nights when attending the Brit Awards at the O2. Booked a standard suite, but upgraded to an executive suite with a balcony, which allows you to get some fresh air in. No problem, and just 60 pounds extra per night. Breakfast is then included, which it was not in the standard suite price. So actual price difference was just 20 pounds! Breakfast is ok - not like we are used to in Scandinavia, but I guess OK for UK standard. Should fill up much more with breakfast buns - the standard toast loaf is not 5* standard....We tried the restaurant one night, and the food was very good. One of the most tender meats I have had in a restaurant. Good wine list, but the staff are not very attentive when serving. You always make sure the guests have wine in the glass BEFORE you serve the food. And you just don´t assume the guests do not want another bottle even though not all of the people around the table of 14 have had a top up..... We had to ask for this. Lack of skills. Room service was disastrous! Ordered a pizza when we got back from the concert. It took 45-50 min before the showed up at our room at 2 am., and the pizza was a Dr.Oetker which had barely been in the oven, with a small part of a salad leaf on each bite! It said rocket salad on the menu, but this was ""a part of a leaf of a plain salad""! How much does rocket salad cost in the UK?.... Just not good enough for a hotel of this standard. Otherwise, nice sized suites, and even bathroom - considered on a boat. Molton Browns toiletries is never wrong! But not suitable for a city/shopping break! We spent like 1 hour in a car just to get to Piccadilly Circus - and same back  - two days in a row.",4,2017,02,26
119,Good value,"Stayed at the sunborn for one night, the room was immaculate and we had a private (small) balcony. Unfortunately it was inland facing which I think it's definitely worth upgrading to a river view. If I'm honest when I looked out of the window you may as well of been staying in a normal hotel as all you can see is tarmac! (The excel centre)
Molton brown toiletries in the bathroom which was a lovely extra, bath robes included as we're slippers,hair dryer and a lavazza coffee pod machine. Very comfortable bed and pillows, and spacious rooms!! 
Definitely worth a visit to the bar, comfortable sofas and a wonderful view out onto the river. Great balcony to sit out on if the weather is ok! Service and staff very helpful and pleasant, not over stuffy or too posh which I was worried about. 
Dinner was lovely, I wouldn't book to eat there if it hadn't been a special occasion as it came to nearly £100 for x2 main meals, x1 starter x1 dessert (£10 for chocolate brownie and a scoop of ice cream!!!!!!) and £14 for a fish cake starter!!!! But the starter was unbelievably good, just hard to justify the cost. Drinks expectantly costly.
My husband had the beef which was again unbelievably good, but at £32 it should of been. My chicken was box standard good food, wouldn't rave about it for £23 though. 
Breakfast was amazing value for £14, buffet style and pretty much everything you could want for. Great views of the river and really good service. 
Victoria Tube station was a good 5-10 min walk, but rather a pretty walk along the dockside, as custom house station was closed (for refurbish) 
All in all a real novelty to stay on a yacht and it really does feel like your on the water (but without the sea sickness!!) would definitely stay again but to save some £££ we'd eat at some of the local restaurants instead. 
If you're looking for something different, great views and atmosphere with a brilliant breakfast (but don't mind being a good 40 mins tube ride outside of central London) then I'd recommend you stay here! 

",5,2017,02,25
119,Another good stay.,"This is turning in to my best place to stay in London now. The scene is just amazing, I always love walking into this hotel. So impressive. Staff are frendy and professional and rooms are spacious and well equipped.",4,2017,02,25
119,Excellent Stay,"We had basic rooms without breakfast but we complained as there was loud banging at 11pm. They moved us no hassle, upgraded rooms and free breakfast for 2 days, brilliant customer service. This hotel has a lovely set out, and design to the hotel. Would stay again, love it here.",5,2017,02,24
119,Mid week treat!,"Can highly recommend this venue! The friendly, welcoming staff made our treat extra special! The food & accommodation exceeded our expectations & the hotel is in a great location for sightseeing etc around London.
Thank you to some of the staff on duty; Vadim, Isabel, Cozmin & Nicolae (I hope I got the spelling right!) you are a credit to your company!
Kind regards,

119,Weekend treat,"This is more than just a couple of nights away in a London hotel, the boat itself is very sumptuous to look at . The rooms are like proper cabins, but you should try for a water view with a balcony. This lets you see the lights of London after dark and the pleasure of sitting out with a drink last thing. The breakfast was plentiful and of a good standard and the bar was good. My only criticism would be that for both nights of our stay the restaurant was fully booked!",4,2017,02,23
119,Very enjoyable stay!!!,"My wife and I stayed on board the Sunborn hotel, London for a couple of nights earlier this week. Such a novel idea staying on a ship for a London break as opposed to a standard hotel.
Our room was very spacious, clean and well equipped with everything you need and a large, very comfortable bed.
We didn't eat or drink at the hotel simply because we wanted to make the most of our break and headed out all day each day.
Our first thought was maybe it was a bit too far out from the Covent Garden/ Piccadilly area where we wanted to go but actually found the route via the DLR and central line very easy and painless making the idea of being a bit away from it all actually quite appealing.
We would definitely recommend this hotel, especially at the bargain price we found it for and would definitely stay there again ourselves in the future.",4,2017,02,23
119,Waste of time,"Regrettably I shall not be returning.
They fleece you for a deposit of 40 card or 100 cash returnable Ina weeks time WHY?
The staff are bulshy and unwilling to accommodate requests such as anniversary etc.
29th Wedding anniversary completely ignored. The rooms stunk of cigarettes, alongside the receptions staff. This was either coming from the air vents or the balcony.
The coffee machine is complicated and the tea and coffee is misery.
All complaints were ignored  despite sending emails to the management.
Don't waste your money especially groupon deals/ you will get a second class service.",1,2017,02,22
119,Great location ,"Stunning ship a great place to stay if visiting excel or 02 as very close by 
Rooms very nice and layout is good had a problem with air conditioning and had to change rooms in the night staff helpful. A quirky hotel  ",4,2017,02,22
119,Amazing,"Celebrated my husbands 50th, we booked a standard river view but then decided to upgrade to executive riverside. The room was amazing, luxury and a superb weekend had. We had afternoon tea which was stunning and then evening meal in restaurant that night. The food was outstanding and could not fault. The staff were fanatastic, husband said they are very attentive but not so much that it made you feel uncomfortable.  The whole experience to us was very posh and up market but not so much that we ever felt uncomfortable.  We will be returning.",5,2017,02,21
119,Nice hotel shame about the service,"Lovely hotel, but they charged us for food we didn't have, didn't return the deposit and the final invoice was complete garbage which even they couldn't explain. They conned us out of £65 in the end. Also the refundable deposit takes 10 days and needless to say we haven't seen it yet.
Just don't bother, stay somewhere else!",1,2017,02,21
119,Large rooms and great location,"Stayed for one night with my partner in Feb as a belated Valentines present. 
We stayed in a classic dock view which was fantastically large with ample storage space and mirrors! In hindsight we would have upgraded to a balcony so we could have sat on it at night as for Feb the weather was great!
The room comes with 2 bottles of complimentary water, if you'd like to purchase more at the bar these are £3 each normally so i would suggest to pop to Tesco which is 5 minutes walk down the road to stock up prior. 
Good sized bathroom however with the look of this lovely boat I did think the bathrooms would have been of a higher standard.
Unfortunately we didn't eat dinner on the boat however we did go to a lovely chinese which is a stones throw away called China palace which was lovely and we hobbled back to boat after a couple of bottles of bubbly which was great. 
If you're here after an event at the Excel you won't be dissapointed as it's literally 30 second walk, in fact if you have a dock view room you're able to see the main entrance. 
Unfortunately we didn't try the lounge bar as it was closed for a private event and wasn't open until 5pm on our check in day, by the point we started getting ready for dinner.
We did however buy a bottle from the top floor bar which was £40 for a bottle of prosecco. 
My partner bought the romantic package as a surprise however after finding out how much it was after I wouldn't reccomend purchasing it. It was £45 for plastic roses and 4 truffle chocolates. You would have at least expected real roses for that price!
Breakfast was great in the morning, they had an offer on for breakfast between 7-9 it was £7.50 from 9-11 it was £12.50 but worth every penny. Nice hot breakfast buffet which was constantly being refilled and a great selection of pastries, juices, cereals and bread (for toasting and baguettes) 
I would probably return should it be a special occasion and if they were doing any deals however probably wouldn't pay £200 again for a night through any other circumstances.",5,2017,02,21
119,Brilliant service,"I went with my then girlfriend as a romantic get away ( I even proposed). The staff, especially algirdas, were excellent and really helped me pull of the surprise. Food was excellent and generally the whole stay was memorable.

Also great transport links for getting around town.",5,2017,02,21
119,Absolutely worth it. ,Spent a night there with my husband. It was the right location for some quality time in couple. The venue was smashing and the vue from our room was an absolutely beautiful and romantic. The executive room is worth every penny. I will do it all over again. Staff are very kind and helpful. The bar is another bonus to the yacht. Drinks are suburb with delicious cocktails. Nice decent crowd and lovely people. Will definitely go back soon. ,5,2017,02,21
119,50th birthday,had a fantastic weekend on the sunborn made a special 50th birthday a maryiam was loveley and so helpfull would do it all again in a heartbeat ! waiting to go back next time and try the landsend restaurant really is nice,5,2017,02,21
119,Great hotel,"This is really great if you are looking to do something different, the rooms are immaculate and quite spacious considering it's a yacht, great views of the Thames and Canary Wharf, perfect location for Excel, right at the front door in fact.  Some great bars and restaurants a stones throw away.  Definitely worth a stay!",5,2017,02,18
119,Brilliant ,"Can't fault it. Little pricy but worth every penny.  Staff were super.  Reception was very welcoming and helpful. 
We only stayed one night wish it could have been more. Perfect city getaway . All transport links a walk away. Nice walks along the hotel. Highly recommend this place",5,2017,02,18
119,Lovely stay.,This was booked for a Valentines get away and I was not disappointed. The staff couldn't have been more helpful and accommodating. The room was lovely and have a lot of rose tinted mirrors which really set it off. I payed slightly extra for the river view room but it was worth it because if I booked a room on the other side people may have been able to see in so we would of had to of kept our curtains closed all night. Also from the riverside you can get lovely views of the docklands and o2 from the balcony. The only down side about this hotel is that if you have stuff planned in central London it is a bit out of the way and having to use the DLR is a bit of a pain. Overall though it was a lovely stay.,5,2017,02,17
119,Groupon deal,"We bought the deal on Groupon, one night's stay in an executive dock room with breakfast and a bottle of wine. Lovely room- very spacious with a huge bed, sofa and balcony, very clean. Service at check-in was so welcoming and hassle-free, no need to present vouchers or print-outs like I thought we might have to. We decided to go into London for dinner as restaurant was a bit pricey but would definitely go back there next time. Service at the bar was not as good- we went there just before closing to collect our wine. We were told that we would have to order from reception, but were given the choice to sit in the bar if we wanted. So we sat down, only to then be told that actually they needed to move the tables so we would have to go to our room. We felt let down by this as a hotel that truly cared about all of its guests would have first of all taken our order and then taken it round the corner to reception for us. Then allowed us to sit at the bar as offered, especially as there was already another couple there. What made us any different? Just seemed like lazy service. But everything else about the stay was lovely.",4,2017,02,16
119,Something a little different,"Stayed with my wife as a short break. Upon entering the boat and using the lift, the reception area is wonderful with a staircase and lovely decor. The rooms aren't huge but there is plenty of room and all of the facilites that you would expect. Comfortable beds and a generally pleasant ambience. We didn't eat on board as we used the restaurants along the quay, but the restaurant seemed very nice. Only downside would be the reception staff who while ensuring that they say the right thing do seem to give off an air of not caring too much.",4,2017,02,16
119,A nice experience,"A hotel with a difference. You get a feeling as if you are on a cruise. Walking distance form Excel, London. Nice spacious rooms with all basic amenities. Though you cannot drive right to the hotel (except few exceptions), a good experience. ",4,2017,02,15
119,60th Birthday Afternoon Tea,"This was a special afternoon tea for my mothers' 60th Birthday ( 14th February) . Very easy to find,nice decor and the staff were very friendly and attentive. We had the traditional afternoon tea and it was lovely, everything was fresh and tasted delicious. 

There were other people eating lunch board the Lands End Restaurant where we had our afternoon tea and the food looked very good. I will definitely go back for another afternoon tea and dinner too.  
Thanks to the Sunborn for a lovely afternoon.
",5,2017,02,15
119,Weekend away,This was a great weekend with such care to every detail and so near to so many attractions a mear boat ride away with trips to the o2 via cable cars a walk around the visitors centre a trip to the shard,5,2017,02,15
119,Sunborn Yacht Docklands,"Stayed here for one night with my wife in January 2017, was excellent. Food in the evening was also very good we both had fillet steak which was nice and tender one of the best steak we have had. The accommodation is superb as is the breakfast. All in all very nice if you want to go away for a romantic weekend. The location is great as well as the yacht is in close proximity of the Emirates Air line (ski type lift) which takes you over the Thames right into the O2 area.  The bar stays open until late although there was no entertainment just back ground music which was OK.",5,2017,02,14
119,Worth the visit,We had 1 night stay on the boat in a executive balcony room- very impressed with space and location. Food is a bit pricey and put us off eating on the boat so we felt like we missed out a bit there. Maybe a deal for overnight guests on food would be a good option. Worth the visit and the stay to say you have been on a super yacht.,4,2017,02,14
119,Amir ,Really nice hotel.great bar staff.we originally had only booked for one night but the service at the hotel bar was so amazing we booked for another night.special thanks to Mr. J at the bar for his amazing service . couldn't have been any better,5,2017,02,14
119,Fantastic!,Went on a Woucher Deal. Very good value. As it turned out I had not completed my booking via the site so when we tried to check in they had no record of it. It was my wife's birthday and the day before Valentines Day. I could see trouble ahead!  They went out of their way to sort out my error. Finding us a lovely room. Finding us a space at dinner and generally going the extra mile. Food was as good as I have had anywhere and the service was great. Not a cheap night out by any means but worth every penny. Would highly recommend it. ,5,2017,02,14
119,Perfect,This place is amazing! Perfect weekend away for me and my partner. Staff were lovely very accommodating and friendly.. the dinner was nicer than I ever imagined! Upgraded our room to one with a balcony made our experience even better. The whole place blew us away. Would definitely recommend and go back again  ,5,2017,02,14
119,Wonderful Stay,"Just back from a night on this wonderful Yacht. From the time we arrived to when we departed we have to say that the staff and service was great. It is located right on the doorstep of Excel so great if you are going there.

We had a dock side Executive room on the ""2nd Floor"", very large and spotlessly clean with all the amenities you would need. Shower room with great pressure. If I stayed again I would opt for a higher room and river view, but that is a personal choice.

We took a walk around the vicinity, not much out here apart from the Excel! one or two restaurants, a Tesco Express and a lovely small cafe and a few other hotels. 

As we had dinner included we went back to the Yacht and after a short rest went to the bar for a cocktail. Dinner was wonderful great starters and mains, the only thing that was a little let down was the choice of desserts and there not being a cheesboard. The wine list is ok with about a 3 to 4 times mark up, which is not too bad.

The following day we had breakfast again great service and overall good, but my wife thought the choice of ""pastries"" could be improved.

Would we go back?, yes we would if we needed to stay in that area but it is a little trek out of London, you can get the Emirates Cable Car to the O2 but that finishes at 10pm.  Otherwise it is DLR in.",4,2017,02,13
119,A Joy,"A pleasant stay for one night.

Great views,great rooms and great staff.
Very easy check in.
Drinks at the bar a tad pricey, breakfast before 9am was £5 cheaper.
If I was being over fussy it would be the breakfast waiting staff kept hovering near and the moment you put you knife and fork down they were asking if you wanted to have your plate taken away, it felt rushed when there was no need .    ",4,2017,02,13
119,Another great stay,My wife booked the yacht hotel as a valentine treat as we had originally visited in 2007. Although the outside has changed a bit the inside is much the same. The reception staff are friendly and efficient and the cabins are akin to being on a cruise although bigger than the normal standard. They are very clean although there was a small stain on the carpet it did not detract from the high standard of cleanliness. I cannot comment on any meal as we did not have an evening meal or breakfast but it looked like the prices were about par for a London hotel. A word of advice the Custom House DLR station is closed until the end of the year so use Royal Victoria station instead - it's about 7-8 minute walk. Would thoroughly recommend as a base as easy to explore from here.,5,2017,02,13
119,Unusual place to stay,"We stayed in a family room, which was a large double and a sofa bed,  plenty of room,  clean and warm,  nice sized TV,  coffee maker (although could have done with a few more coffee pods) lovely molten brown toiletries. Didn't eat in the restaurant but it looked really nice and the bar was a nice place to have a quiet drink,  but beware prices are on the steep side,  £5 for a bottle of beer,  £3.50 for a fruit juice and £12-£15 for a cocktail. Exactly like being on a small cruise ship,  but something a bit different and I would recommend staying here if like us you were visiting the o2.",4,2017,02,13
119,Xmas present,"I brought this as an extra gift for myself and my husband for xmas as something different.  The ship is amazing, their was a strange musky smell in lift, bar, and lobbies, but the room was very spacious and didn't have a funny smell, we had a light lunch in the bar which was presented beautifully and very nice, we had a few cocktails which were although quite dear very tasty.  We then left the boat for our evening meal which was not nice, so we arrived back on the boat for about 9 and carted on where we left off, we had in our package a complement bottle of merlot it wouldn't have been our choice in red wine but it was drinkable.  We stayed in the bar till after twelve the staff were very friendly.  We also had a complementary breakfast on board and was not disappointed, well stocked the sausages we're especially nice. Would definitely recommend the sunborn yacht hotel to all who would listen.  Something different.",4,2017,02,13
119,Excellent,"Checking in was easy and our room was perfect, we stayed in an executive room with a balcony, dock side view.
I had booked the stay with breakfast and complimentary wine through Groupon, it was my first time using Groupon so I was a bit worried about whether everything was going to have gone through ok but everything was fine. 
We didn't eat on board however we did have our complimentary wine in the bar area which again was lovely and the staff very polite and friendly.
Breakfast was also very nice, there was a great variety to accommodate everyone.
The yacht is just a short walk from the nearest tube station or you could take the cable cars over to the O2.
All in all, I would definitely recommend staying here and we will be back!",5,2017,02,13
119,Great Option If Attending Excel Events,"I love the concept of a yacht hotel.  A great option for those attending events at the Excel Centre. My requests were met And I got the king-size bed as requested and a cabin on the fifth floor facing the river. 

I checked in early and then proceeded to the Excel Centre.  Upon my return my luggage was not in my room as expected and it took a while for it to be brought up which was less than ideal.

The cabin was a good size with lovely woodwork; however the overall decor was lacking a bit of uumph and I think some simple fixes could take it from good to really fantastic.  The bathroom while clean again was lacking the wow factor for me.

Free wireless was available but this should be standard at most hotels.

In theory the concept of the tablet in the room to order full spa services et cetera was good; however my tablet was not working. I did advise the reception but no one thought to have someone investigate. To be fair I could have requested that they send someone but I just couldn't be bothered.

Lunch at the restaurant was quite good quality for a reasonable price and while the dining room is not overly large it had a nice ambiance.

I was pleased to see the high level of secure access to the guest floors which are sometimes lacking in some hotels.  However they nullified this by letting a guest next door into my room while I was in it.  Apparently she locked herself out and gave a passing member of staff the wrong room number.  He should have referred her to reception rather than opening the door for her.

The whole atmosphere seemed lively and buzzing with quite a few events going on and it seemed quite a popular choice.

On the whole quite a good stay and I will check out the one in Gibraltar.  However I think it's a bit on the pricey side for what is essentially a four-star hotel.

N",4,2017,02,13
119,Overnight stay dinner and beakfast,"I booked this as a surprise Christmas present for my husband. We were greeted at reception by Sandra who was a credit to Sunborn London.  I double checked our booking for dinner that evening but it wasn't on the system and they were fully booked. I explained I booked Christmas Day and I have a mobility problem and I cannot walk far. Sandra got straight on to the restaurant, the restaurant supervisor said if I had a booking for dinner I should have received an e-mail confirming this, I dint know this was the procedure so I did not chase my dinner reservation.  Sandra said the restaurant would contact me about getting me a table.  I went back to reception over an hour later and Sandra came to my rescue and called the restaurant manager who offered us a table at 18.00 it was rather early but at least they accommodated us.  Sandra was a star through the whole thing always pleasant ans helpful, what an asset she is to Sunborn.  We went to dinner and the staff in the dining room were amazing they looked after us and made sure I was ok as I walk with a walking aid.  The food was delicious and the view excellent.  The staff were attentive but not intrusive get dinner and lovely smiley staff.  The room was excellent and spotlessly clean.  We went to the bar and had a cocktail, the staff once again were amazing. Gerry Cristina, Jay and Cozmin were very pleasant and they asked us to try their cocktail jelly it was an exciting idea but we did say you need to cut down on the amount of mint and perhaps finely chop the mint, they were all very friendly.  I must say I wished we had booked for two nights.",5,2017,02,12
119,Night on board ,"We travel in to London on a regular basis for evenings and days out. We are always looking for different locations to stay over. 
We have always said that it would be great to stay on the yacht. 
We are so pleased that we did on Friday 10th February 
The room and high quality of service received from the staff was second to none.
We enjoyed the restaurant for our evening meal and breakfast
We will look to stay on board again in the near future. NG
",5,2017,02,12
119,A first class overnight experience in very luxurious surroundings,"Stopped briefly here for a drink last year and wanted an excuse to stay over, so as we were going to the Strictly show the next day i booked us in.You have to take the lift up to the deck and as you come into reception it has a real wow factor, glass chandelier amazing staircase and that was just reception, things you don`t really expect on a yacht.
Most of the staff were helpful ( one or two were a bit pompous) the room was spacious and very deep carpets , big comfy bed, thick soft towels and tea and coffee in the room, the real coffee machine was a welcome surprise and plenty of cupboard space which is always welcome as usually there is never enough.There is also a large rear deck area outside the lounge bar if the weather is good.
Alas we could not book for dinner as it was already fully booked but the menu looked appetising.If you want somewhere to stay, maybe for a special occasion, i would heartily recommend this yacht as i think it is great value for money.",5,2017,02,12
119,Amazing Service ,"Just spent a fab week on the Sunborn London with work.  Such a lovely and unique place to stay, very convenient for the Excel Centre.  The staff were amazing and friendly and helpful.  They couldn't do enough for me. My room was gorgeous, spacious, comfortable, clean and well equipped with everything that I needed. ",5,2017,02,12
119,Ship-shape,"Spent a night on board this super yacht and it was brilliant. All of the staff were lovely - in particular the reception staff on arrival. 
We had a deal where we had an Executive Room with 3 course a la carte dinner and a glass of champagne and breakfast the following morning which made it incredible value for money. The food was beautiful and if there was a negative it was the champagne which none of us were able to drink - just not very nice! 
The boat itself was immaculate and the room was lovely with a very comfortable bed. The underfloor heating in the bathroom was fantastic along with the products and large fluffy white towels. 
A really lovely treat of a weekend and well worth a visit. 
",5,2017,02,11
119,Stayed 9.02.17,"Husband booked a night away with groupon for my birthday present. We arrived just before check in 3pm, very impressed with the outside, to get in you have to go up in a lift, as soon as you see the reception area you are blown away with how grand it looks. Checked in was ok, lady was pleasant enough. We had paid extra to get a bigger room room. Very impressed with the room everything was clean and tidy. We have paid for evening meal, this was ok. Had breakfast in the morning which was very nice, would say the breakfast staff are friendlier than the evening staff. Overall very surprised with the place, all very clean and very grand. Nothing to do outside the yacht as it is in the docking area of London. Yes I would return again. ",5,2017,02,10
119,just went on for a drink and a snack,"a real nice place and well decorated 

we only had drinks and a few snacks but was treated so well by great staff 

very clean and nice soft chairs 

nice surroundings and will visit again 

a tad pricey but you pay for what you get and its well worth what you pay 

well worth a visit if you are close by",4,2017,02,08
119,Good but not great,"If you want somewhere to stay in London that's different then this ticks the box. The Location is next to Excel, so great if you wish to visit for an event. To get into central London however is a bit of a trek, via DLR and either tube or as we used the water taxi's up the Thames. 
The rooms are very well appointed, however, noise insulation could be better. We had massive disturbance from room above, resulting in 2 calls to reception at 3am and 4am which spoilt the experience. However on the plus side the management and all staff are very good and attentive.
We only ate breakfast so cannot comment on food. Breakfast was ok, not amazing
In summary, expensive experience but different. Would have received 5 stars if noise was not a problem",4,2017,02,08
119,Novel idea!,"The room we stayed in was nice and spacious with a small balcony. The breakfast was very good with a wide variety of choice including vegetarian. I would say it is rated fairly as a four star hotel, it is not five star luxurious internally as people might expect as it is a cruise ship but nevertheless pleasant. I would imagine as the weather starts to get warmer the outside decking area for drinks would be a lovely added bonus for your stay.",4,2017,02,07
119,Nina and Nick ,"Loved the sunburn yacht. Had a fab time. Staff were super welcoming and friendly, receptionist, Tillea, was very helpful, couldn't do enough for us. Can't wait for my next visit, highly recommend 👌👌👌",5,2017,02,07
119,Anniversary Break,"This hotel is simply wonderful! The check in process was very straightforward and had a lovely warm welcome when we arrived! We had an executive room with a river view and it was so lovely. The room was very spacious, with a kingsize bed and a sofa and stunning views of the river, perfect for catching a sunset. The bathroom was of big size and the shower was lovely, very warm and relaxing and the molten brown toiletries was a nice touch. Dinner in the restaurant was just as nice and the service there was as friendly as down at check in. The breakfast was delicious too and there was plenty to choose from at the buffet - cooked items, cereal, pastries, ham/cheeses fruit and yoghurts and a range of fruit juices. Cocktails in the bar were also very pleasant, slightly expensive but the atmosphere in the bar made it worth it and you can enjoy some lovely views along the river. There isn't much to say in regards to the location, not many restaurants or bars nearby, but there is a local Tesco and a tube station less than 5 minute walk from the hotel. I would really recommend this hotel to anyone who may be having doubts, yes it's a little bit pricey but completely worth it. I've stayed at a lot of hotels but none quite like this, truly a memorable experience.",5,2017,02,07
119,Nice treat but could improve,"Spent the night here to celebrate our wedding anniversary. Place looks spectactular.Found check in process took a long time, and then our key cards did not work.
Dock view room, but good size.Only 1 robe for double room and no drinking glasses. Took ages to get through to a department to help us, but when the lady did arrive she was very helpful.
Think the staff need to pay more attention to the small things that do make a difference",4,2017,02,06
119,Nearly a very good rating....,"My boyfriend and I stayed at this hotel last night (4th Feb). As we approached the hotel it looked stunning. It is situated very close to the Excel centre. To access the reception area we needed to take a lift. The decor in the reception area is stunning. Check in time was 3pm and we checked in at 5pm. We were welcomed by a very pleasant receptionist and he quickly and efficiently booked us in. Our room had a river view. The room was large and on inspection I saw that we had a t.v., coffee maker, kettle, hair dryer (in the bathroom), safe, iron, trouser press, ipad (attached to the wall) and a fridge. The bed was very comfortable and we had towels and a few Bobby Brown toiletries.There were coffee, tea, milk sachets, various herbal teas, 1 hot chocolate sachet and sugar. The general decor on the boat was luxurious and the bar was very relaxing. We enjoyed a delicious gin and tonic each (£21.50 for two) they were very large and included a piece of lemon grass which I was told brings out the flavour of the gin. Views at night were excellent. Bar staff were very friendly and approachable but a bit slow. We enjoyed a lovely breakfast this morning (£12 on the day) which was a buffet style and had a lot of well cooked and delicious food to choose from.  On the down side and what made this review and average are the following. There were no flannels, no body lotion, only a few coffee pods (3), no peppermint tea bags, only small bottles of water. The bed had empty biscuit wrappers under the Tempura type mattress topper that we slept on which indicated to me that the sheets had not been changed! There were coffee stains on the carpet. The thing that really upset us was that a letter not addressed to us but dated the 6th February and a very nice tin decorated like an English penny with a large piece of chocolate inside was left as a gift to the customer who was going to be staying in our room on Monday two days after us. This did not enthuse us to feel welcome, did not give a personal touch, and in fact I felt that this was very rude. It was a shame that this quirky experience, that we had been looking forward to, was spoilt in this way. There is also not a lot to do around the surrounding area so good for those who want to stay put but you will need to travel to another area to enjoy and evening out.",3,2017,02,05
119,Amazing stay.,"This was my 3rd stay abourd the Sunborn Hotel yacht. The perfect night away started before we arrived when Maryiam emailed me to confirm we could have 2 rooms together and if there was anything she could do to help make our stay any better then contact her. The reception could not have been more accommodating.We got to the room to find chocolates and a personal handwritten letter welcoming us. We went on the top deck to take a few photos and a member of staff offered to take the photos of us together, it was Maryiam. Again she said if we needed anything just ask.She could not have been more helpfull if she tried. There was Molton Brown toiletries in the bathroom, a selection of Twinings teas, hot chocolate and a real coffee maching with coffee pods and complimentary water in the fridge.We had an amazing stay and cant wait to go back again next month. I cant praise the staff enough for their professionalism, politeness and eagreness to please. I give this a 5 star all round.",5,2017,02,04
119,Lovely and different,"Was a lovely boat, summer would have been a better experience as had trouble finding it on foot!  only critism I would say about room - I had river view - is that no face cloths and no body lotion. nowhere for tassimo machine to sit and definately not enough capsules of coffee. Bit mean. otherwise its a great 'something' different to do and stay. but definitely summer would be better next time watching the sunset!  Had dinner in the restaurant and only thing I would add, but its personal for me, is that waitresses and waiters really need to understand that its not a race to get from starters to coffee to evacuate the table.... its an experience to eat out, share food and wine and conversation.. hate being constantly interrupted with the next bit.. like I say a personal view though.  my dinners should take min 3 hours....",4,2017,02,03
119,Quite disappointed ,"Don't get me wrong from the dock the boat is stunning but on entering the room we just didn't feel wowed! I have been on cruise ships and yachts which were much more special. It's quite dated. 
A few points- 
-Shower is extremely slippy
 -Try to con you out of money for an upgrade you don't request
- Coffee machine just streamed watery coffee out
-breakfast hot food is very very oily
- go on the cable car to o2 and eat there
- no mattress just a topper
- only 1 shampoo, body wash, conditioner is daft
 
I won't go on. We did have a lovely time but it was more the company than the surroundings.
Just felt let down for the price

119,Fantastic yacht hotel next to ExCel.,"We had a wonderful stay at the Yacht Hotel at Royal Victoria Dock. Initially I thought how can a staying on a boat be a good idea? Well it was a great idea! Not only were the rooms much more spacious than I expected. There was a really nice restaurant that served a great English breakfast. We went out into London quite a bit so our experience was mostly with the bar behind reception. We were so well taken care of! Everyone who served us were just fantastic. I want to mention Isabella, Nico, Cosmin, and Jay specifically as they were on the same late schedule as we were,. 

All in all I would not hesitate to come back for the next event at ExCel. Being able to walk across the dock in minutes made it so convenient. And we were pleasantly surprised by the upscale accommodations. Thank you!",5,2017,02,02
119,"The cruise that never moves, a great experience.","We celebrated my wife's birthday with a long weekend stay. The yacht really is impressive moored on the dockside. From the moment we entered reception the experience was one of quality, comfort and warm attentive service. Aware of our celebration on arrival we were invited to have drinks in the VIP lounge where we watched the most amazing sun set against the backdrop of Canary Wharf and the 02. We felt like we were on holiday. We loved the room, as the photo on the website, a huge comfortable bed, and a small balcony with pleasant views of the south side of the dock. Amazingly peaceful. The hotel's restaurant, Landsend was very nice, attentive polite staff, a romantic ambience and the food was superb. The fillet steak was to die for, medium rare, flavoursome and melt in your mouth. The hotel bar is large, casual and relaxing. The layout allows privacy with huge comfortable sofas that aren't on top of each other. The hotel is in a developing part of London and future investment is huge. On the doorstep of Canary Wharf and North Greenwich and a short hop into central London the location is excellent. You don't get this quality and space in central London hotels and certainly not at this price. We are Londoners and we feel the wow factor here. Anyone from outside of London can only be in awe. A must to visit. The only other guarantee I can give is that you won't be sea sick on this boat. ",5,2017,02,01
119,Disappointed ,"We were really looking forward to our stay on the Sunborn. 
We arrived: The Staff amazing, very helpful and all were approachable, smart and polite.
The Hotel: We were let down, our room 5023 had a stained Carpet, it let the standard of the hotel down.
The Sky Bar was being refurbished, this we really wanted to enjoy as part of our stay, we were told when we arrived it was closed - however we were not offered anything for the inconvenience.
Breakfast: As the restaurant is also used by city business workers it felt rather impersonal, also there were conferences being held next to the restaurant, not to mention the city workers chatting on there phones; it didn't feel like a break away as this is why we go for a break - to get away from work / phones / busy lives. No room service is offered for Breakfast which would help visitors who do come for a break, we certainly didn't expect to be surrounded by city clientele.
Again staff were amazing.
Photos of the carpet in our room attached.

119,1st Anniversary,"This was an amazing stay.
We spent our first anniversary here and they treated us with a 5* service!
When we arrived, the receptionist Victor treated us greatly and answered all our questions in a happy manner, he gave us a letter which congratulated us on our anniversary. The room was beautiful and absolutely worth the money!
We booked a table in the restaurant where we were served by Carolina and Teodora. They made sure our meal was perfect and treated us with 5* service and made us feel welcomed. A 'Happy Anniversary' slate came out with some cupcakes and a candle after our main meal and really made us feel special! The only downside would be that the menu was very limited, only about 5 dishes to choose from out of the mains. Also I was told to book 2 weeks in advance to be able to request halal meat, which I did and was told that it would be available for us, but when he arrived the chef said he didn't have it.
Would definitely stay again, but perhaps eat somewhere else. I am already planning a night for our next anniversary!!",5,2017,01,31
119,First Rate Crew!!!,"The ""hotel"" is remarkable.  Location, excellent.  Attention to detail, fabulous. But what makes this place is the crew.  They were extremely welcoming and made the stay as great as it was. Isabel, Cosmin, Nico and Jay are to be commended.  They are the reason I will be coming back and recommending this place to others.  You will not be disappointed.  If you have an event at the Excel Centre this is definitely the place for you.",5,2017,01,31
119,Great place to stay.,"Stayed here as part of my Christmas present from my girlfriend. We didn't use any of the facilities apart from the bar, which wasn't too badly priced considering. We declined the offer of  a £70 upgrade for a river view, balcony and breakfast. We were only going to be staying in our room at night and saw a cafe advertising full English around the corner for £7.
The rooms themselves are fantastic, really good size and the bathrooms are really good too. 
The staff were excellent too, very polite and attentive. 
If anyone is having a weekend on the Sunborn, here's a tip. Get the Emirates cable car over the Thames, go to the Greenwich pier and get a river taxi to Westminster. A great way to see London in comfort. Beats the tube any day and it's all contact less payments",4,2017,01,31
119,"Fantastic and memorable stay,very nice place.","I visited the Suborn Yacht Hotel in January with my fiance for a special weekend. The stay was wonderful and amazing . The hotel is super luxurious with a magnificent decoration,very beautiful. We was very impressed with the fantastic hotel and the high quality service ,very nice and professional staff.  We loved the stay and we want come back again.",4,2017,01,29
119,Excellent idea,We stayed for one night during January on board the Yacht Hotel. The decor  is lovely and our cabin was beautiful. The restaurant food and service were very good if a little overpriced. The wine menu could have been better. There's not much to see outside but we took the Emirates cable car over the Thames and had a look around the O2. There are loads of eating places fhere. situated next door to the Excel centre.,4,2017,01,29
119,Stunning Hotel in a great location,"We stayed here this week and we were very impressed with the whole experience.Just wish we could have stayed longer :O)Breakfast was very good and plentiful in a lovely restaurant over looking the river.Very good service in both the bar and the restaurant the evening before.
Comfy beds, but carpet was a little bit grubby for my liking hence not a 5.",4,2017,01,29
119,Beautiful and differentiated stay,"Good option for those who, like me, are looking for a differentiated experience. The property is beautiful and full of fancy details. Looks brand new, but I expected a little bit more on the cleanliness... We seated on the couch and a cloud of dust came up. Minutes later the entire room was covered in dust (kind of disgusting)... Not very nice. Other than that, the staff was gentle and friendly, the location is great (full of things to do either in Victoria docs as well as in North Greenwich - which is easily reached through the cable cars).",4,2017,01,29
119,Luxury ,Wow what more do I need to say? Luxury and beautiful felt special. The staff were friendly the rooms were gorgeous and comfortable with great views across the river. Was a different experience highly recommend staying here. Breakfast was really good and we took advantage of the special offer price they had that weekend. ,5,2017,01,28
119,Afternoon Tea,"I bought an afternoon tea for my in laws aboard the Sunborn as it was something different.

We arrived early and were seated in the restaurant which is lovely with views over the docks. The waitresses were very attentive but not  intrusive.

The afternoon team was reasonable, with plenty of choice of sandwiches and cakes, there were multiple teas and coffees to chose from, some very exotic sounding names like African Soltice, Blueberry Merlot etc.

All of the food was fresh and we were offered more sandwiches and tea as we had eaten them, we had a second helping and was then full up.

The only downside was there was some building work going on which was noisy, I mentioned this to the waitress who kindly gave the whole party a complementary glass of Champagne.

Worth a visit, for a different experience

119,"Fantastic stay, totally impressed by level of service......","I visited the Sunborn Yacht Hotel in January to celebrate my husband's birthday and bought a nights stay with dinner through a Groupon deal  It was a birthday surprise and my husband is not easily impressed but he was so impressed with the luxuriousness of the hotel and the high quality of service.  The food provided was excellent and the hotel suite (ours was situated overlooking the Thames) was magnificent. I have been on luxury cruises before and this definitely had a feel of a cruiser line albeit on a much smaller scale even though we were berthed on the Thames!  The check in staff realised it was my husband's birthday and bought chocolate truffles to our room to wish him a happy birthday and welcome us onboard.  After dinner he was presented with a cake with happy birthday written on the plate and was so touched by this kind gesture.  The yacht although rated as 4* definitely provides a 5*  customer service.  The staff are polite, friendly and approachable and made our stay pleasurable.  I hasten to say that I will definitely be staying at the Sunborn again in the not too distant future!",5,2017,01,28
119,Fabulous stay,Spent the weekend on board the sunborn yacht. When we arrived our booking couldn't be found but this was soon sorted out. Our room was on deck 1 and was lovely and spacious and clean and tidy. The location may not be best suited to do some sightseeing but for what we wanted it was ideal. The DLR is close by as is the emirates cable car over to the O2. We booked our evening meal at the restaurant and it was superb service and food were faultless we both had the beef fillet and it was perfectly cooked. We had breakfast too and there was a good variety of food. All in all a lovely place to stay and all the staff were very helpful and polite. Would definitely recommend. ,5,2017,01,27
119,"Something different, very nice at a price","My daughters bought us a night on this yacht hotel for xmas through Groupon , which has proven to be a very nice hotel. 

The Groupon process was no difficulty at all, the Executive Room was booked and ready on arrival, we did ask about upgrading to a suite, but decided not to. Which as it turns out was a good decision, the executive room is great too, spacious, clean, seating area, very comfy bed, nice bathroom and a standing balcony, all in all a nice room.

My only issue there is an empty mini bar - surely a hotel at this price level can fill the fridge!

We had a complimentary bottle of wine in the bar , the bar , deck, reception, and restaurant are all very nicely decorated as you would expect at this price point. Expect £5 for a small bottled beer and about £12 for a cocktail.

We had dinner in the restaurant , the food was very nice if not a little on the expensive side and the service was perfect. I hope the 12% service charge that is added to the bill is given to the staff, they deserve it . Unfortunately being charged an extra £12 on my bill doesn't leave me much in the mood to leave a cash tip for the staff, who deserve it.

Breakfast was pretty standard English breakfast but nice enough , I did have to insist a little for staff to clean a table for us to sit and have breakfast by a window.

All in all check in and out , bar, room, dinner etc were all very good, but at over £200 for a room and about £50 a head for dinner and other hotels a few steps away, just feels a little over priced.

Last thing to note, whilst the bar , restaurant and small decks are done to a high standard, there doesn't seem to be anywhere else to go on the yacht, you can't exactly go exploring the rest of the yacht.

Would I go again, if I was paying probably not, if my daughter is, for sure :)",4,2017,01,25
119,Very disappointed,I was looking for something special to celebrate our special day! Find this yacht hotel! For one night £350 for 2 people! Firstly disappointed room! On the picture it's looks huge but it's not at all! It's nothing special. Do not recommend this hotel for that price!,1,2017,01,25
119,Fabulous!,"Great location and what a fantastic idea for a hotel stay with a difference! We stayed here for 2 nights in December 2016 and could not fault our room, which was enormous and looked out over the dock towards the Thames. Lovely Molton Brown products in the bathroom which was a nice touch and Nespresso coffee machine in the room.
Fantastic value for a hotel with a difference. Buffet breakfast was great and there is a lovely bar area - perfect for sundown drinks.
Located right outside of Exel and 2 minutes walk under a covered walkway from Custom House DLR station and a 10 minute walk from Emirates air link (to O2). Approx 12GBP Uber ride from O2 at night.
Highly recommended",5,2017,01,25
119,Great birthday weekend,"I would like to say special thanks to Maryiam from reception, for personal taking care of my stay at the hotel for my birthday weekend. My whole experience was amazing from the food to the service and staff. I will definitely be returning and recommend this hotel to all my friends and family.",5,2017,01,25
119,K & B Pendred,"Thank you, all the team especially Ines from Landsend restaurant, you made our stay wonderful, nothing  was too much trouble. We would recommend the Sunborn Yacht Hotel to everybody it is just exceptional.",5,2017,01,24
119,Amazing night stay,"I booked an overnight stay for my wife's birthday and it certainly didn't disappoint. We managed to check in slightly early with reception staff extremely courteous and our room was absolutely stunning. It was immaculate with a balcony and a river view. I had booked a spa treatment for both of us and once again the service was excellent and staff really friendly. When we returned to our room there were some hand made chocolates and an invitation to a meet on the VIP deck where we received complementary drinks for an hour. These little things help so much to make night out so memorable. I highly recommend anybody who is looking to do something special for a special occasion to look no further than booking an overnight stay at the Sunborn Yacht Hotel. We had breakfast which was excellent and I would imagine the evening meal would have been very good as well (unfortunately I had already pre-booked somewhere else to eat). All the staff were very professional, helpful and friendly and would like to say thank you for making my wife's birthday treat such a wonderful occasion.",5,2017,01,24
119,Fantastic!!,"A fantastic location and hotel with gorgeous views down the river and perfectly placed to visit the O2 for a show which is just across the river via the Emirates Cable Car ride

Parking is expensive nearby but not too bad at £25 a night 

Good food selection and good breakfast but a tad expensive for what it was",5,2017,01,22
119,Fabulous birthday trip 🍾,"We've just returned from a night at the Sunborn which I bought as part of a birthday treat for my fiancé. 

The nearest car park is literally 3 minutes walk away the Royal Victoria carpark with a flat rate of £15 for 24 hours which is brilliant value! The tube is also a stones throwaway so it's really easy to get to. It's also right by the O2 arena and Londons Excel so a perfect location for anyone attending anything at these venues. 

The hotel itself is a gorgeous sight when you walk round the corner. It has lifts through which you enter from the street and they open onto an amazing reception. Check in was really efficient, worth noting they take a refundable deposit on your credit/debit card at check in.

We had room 4029 which was gorgeous! The rooms are really big and have a large mirror opposite the bed and one full length one on the back of the room door. 

We had bath robes each and slippers and their were Molten Brown toiletries in the bathroom. There is also an iron and ironing board and safe in the room as well.

There is the usual kettle and complimentary bottles of water (one still and one sparkling) but also a Lavazza coffee machine as well which was a lovely touch! 

As it was for my fiancé's birthday I had arranged for a bottle of Champagne to be waiting in the room. The hotel also provided complimentary chocolates for us as well which was lovely. 

The rooms are really quiet we didn't here any noise from anywhere! 

We opted for a full English breakfast in bed which was fantastic!

The room also has a tablet from which you can order room service, contact reception and it has general information on London and the sights which was brilliant if you're not familiar with the area.

We also had afternoon tea and an evening meal at the Lands End restaurant on board the hotel. Both were absolutely exceptional!

We thoroughly enjoyed our stay. All of the staff were incredibly polite and attentive. They really went out of their way to make sure all of the guests where happy. We will definitely return and have already recommended the hotel to friends and family. 

Thank you for a fabulous stay!!",5,2017,01,21
119,Sunborn Hotel London ,"I was treated to a night here for my birthday by my girlfriend. A lovely unique hotel. The room was very spacious, the staff helpful and the food in the restaurant was good. 

We enjoyed our stay, but you are paying tourists prices. I'd stay again maybe in the summer when you can sit out on the deck enjoying a drink and watching the world go by..",4,2017,01,21
119,One night stay for birthday treat,"We stayed for one night this week and on the whole had an  enjoyable stay. The yacht is located in the Royal Victoria Docks, right next to the Excel Centre and  easily accessible by the Docklands Light Railway; situated a few minutes away from the cable cars that take you direct to the O2.
We paid extra for a junior suite  with a riverside view. This was a great size room with a separate lounge and dining area and a large bathroom with a huge bath. It had a balcony affording you views of the docks, Canary Wharf and the O2 which was lovely especially as the weather , although cold, was clear and bright. There were TV's in both the living area and in the bedroom. The room also had vast amounts of storage which given that the boat is now moored, and guests wouldn't  be staying as long, seemed excessive and there could be better uses of the space yo my mind.
However there were a few things that I thought let the hotel down in terms of the description of luxury  ( especially considering the costs of staying here were high compared with other locations). For example there are tea and coffee making facilities provided in the room, a coffee machine and a tray with a kettle connected. However to boil the kettle you need to take the tray and locate a plug which are all at floor level . This means you end up with the tray on the floor all the time. Quite poor as there is a large dining table that it could easily be situated on if one plug was at a mid level. Or some of the storage could be altered so this could be at a convenient height for the guest.
I also found the toiletries selection to be quite poor. Yes they were Molton Brown but they were miniatures ( 1 set of shampoo, conditioner and body wash that is to be used by 2 people)  . For example there was no bubble or foam bath and whilst I appreciate many rooms have showers and is therefore not probably standard issue   I found this to be inconsiderate, especially considering the premium you are paying for such a room. There were also only one or 2 tissues provided in the tissue box. This all seemed quite miserly and gave completely the wrong impression.  I have found much more offered in more basic hotels. 
Also things like the dressing gowns provided. Again, if you want to really consider this to be luxury, then  I would expect these to at least be soft which they weren't. 
Also the standards of housekeeping was poor. There was a glass coffee table in the living room area that had a film of dust over the entire table. I ended up cleaning this off myself. Smears over the cabinets etc. The curtains in the bedroom didn't close properly and the heating in the room wasn't very effective. There was also not a 'tablet' available in the room as I had been led to believe was offered in all rooms.
Some of this seems quite picky but I think given the prices that we paid and the branding of the hotel as 'luxury' I was  disappointed. 
I think with hindsight it would have been better to stay in a standard room ( with a riverside view) and save myself quite a bit of money .
If considering staying I would absolutely recommend paying the extra for a riverside view. The Dockside view is in fact a view of the Excel Centre, other hotels and residential blocks and an area of grass in front of the yacht. 
We didn't eat in the restaurant or have any drinks in the bar as there is plenty in the local vicinity to choose from that is much cheaper.",3,2017,01,21
119,Lovely ,Really lovely stay. Reception is stunning and very friendly staff. Room was lovely cant fault. Breakfast had a good selection although the food wasn't hot unfortunately. And the only thing I would complain about is our king size bed as it was actually two singles and we found ourselves unable to to lie in the middle as we would 'fall down' ,4,2017,01,21
119,J`Yacht`st what we were lookng for!,"Folks....This review, I`ll put a different spin on it..........

Anyway...10th Wedding anniversary - decide not to do one `long haul` schlep, couple of weeks stay on-or-about-the exact date we married in Vegas blah blah blah.....So, what`s the option.....Put together a set of `getaways` of differing theme, length and location.
For us, January`s tight for leave, so, To start off with, somewhere totally different for the two of us, novelty value, deluxe, short and sweet and not a `million miles` from home....We `happened` upon a special deal online - A pamper break on the Sunborn Yacht hotel.....ticked all the boxes and as with the Title, `Just what we were looking for`....

In Feb we`re off to Tenerife for a week, middle of the year we`ll use some of our two weeks to do another short hop multi-centre break and our other 2 x single weeks will be fly drives to pastures new. We`re even `pricing up` the Sunborn Gibraltar for a week in July..........Little and often you could say but different venues and experiences make it an exciting way to celebrate our `10th` for sure.

Anyway, here`s where I break away from the `usual` / almost predictable type of review text..... Main reason being that there`s already a huge amount of feedback and reviews already posted.
Having read very many of these reviews, they, in many ways make me think that they describe a different venue & experience to the delightful one that my wife and I will remember.

I say `in many ways` as some of the negative comments and observations made are accurate and are not contested. For example, the restaurant charges, some service delays and queuing at reception. However, all the positive comments are on the mark.

The one common denominator from the majority of the negative posts is that they are all as a result of customers failing to invest time to research their visit and use some common sense before arriving at the venue.

Potential customers should read a good handful of the reviews & make up their own minds of course. However, prepare and be open minded with your approach to the Sunborn experience, just because it`s in the UK don't make any assumptions about it, research it as you would an overseas venue, research ALL of its facilities including getting there, parking etc...........We Google Earth it - know how to get there from:

1. Station
2. Car Park

Don't assume that there`s `This facility` or `That facility`, find out that it`s not available and then slag the venue off for it!

Anyway, back to the normal format - My wife and I would return to the Sunborn London in a year or so, it is good advice to watch out for any `online` special deals......we will be.",4,2017,01,20
119,Get High,Lovely unique experience - one feels rural almost or off the grid: There is a massive difference between the lower levels and the upper levels - so well worth paying the extra for higher levels with large balcony and water view: The check in staff are nice and the boat does indeed go up and down with the tide - so the entrance lift may confuse one ....but adds to the fun depending upon the tide: Note - I didn't see an easy way to drive right up to the entrance ...once must walk the last Klick .....well maybe not that far ....call it 200 metres....but that all adds to the seclusion. The LCY departures do not annoy and indeed they don't start early anyway. I think this actually add to the scene not detract. The area is easily reached by public transport as well:,5,2017,01,20
119,Return visit for boat show,"Back again one year on from our last visit. We must think it is OK otherwise why would we be coming back? This time we booked one of the executive rooms with a river view. This was over twice the price we paid for a dockside standard room last year. Was it worth it ... in a word ""no"". It may have just been the luck of the draw last year but our dockside lower level room was about twice as big as the ""executive"" room. True this year we did have a river view which was great but frankly, in January we didn't make much use of it. Visit here for the experience but in our view the standard room is good enough. Service actually in the hotel was better this year than last so it looks like they are making improvements. Just don't bother trying to phone them. We called 9 times on our three hour journey to get there to check out the restaurant table situation . Never got through to a human, left two messages and never got a call back",4,2017,01,18
119,Unusual ,"I booked this hotel for two nights as I wanted to surprise my husband for his 50th. After a slight detour from the DLR station - no signpost to show where the hotel was - It didn't disappoint on 1st impression. Stunning entrance stairway, reception very pleasant, room amazing. We had a classic room overlooking the river and it was very tastefully decorated. Coffee machine in room, great touch, as was the in room tablet, which detailed lots of info. Also had tea and coffee making facilities. Bathroom spotlessly clean. Very close to the Emirates cable car, which we went on. Discounted if you have an Oyster card. We didn't have breakfast booked so ventured outside along the docks and found a fabulous cafe which did freshly made full English breakfast and steaming hot cuppa for £15.50 for the two of us. Fully recommended. Tried to book dinner the first night but fully booked so settled for the second night. We ate out at the Lebanese restaurant nearby on the first night, again fully recommended. Unfortunately the second day we were there there was a tube strike and it poured with rain so we didn't venture far, just over to the Excel centre which is a short 2 minute walk. Had a couple of drinks in the lounge bar. On the yacht. Very expensive and a service charge is added. 
The dinner on the second night left a lot to be desired. We arrived at our booked time, in fact a few minutes early, and were seated by the window.....ordered a bottle of wine and our starter and main course.......then waited.....and waited. After about 35 mins, I saw one of the waitresses pass and look at our table and then speak to her colleague who had taken our order and the next minute we were served with a couple of glasses of champagne by way of an apology as the chef had overcooked my husbands crab cake ( I should think he had having to wait 35 mins for our starter to arrive!!!! The main course was delicious - fillet steak - but cannot say it was very well presented, there was no colour (greens) on the plate. Then the pudding came and on checking the prices on the in room tablet they had overcharged me by another £1. Considering the wait and the price we paid I was not impressed to then be charged a service charge of £16.88. In all it was a very disappointing experience and I had wanted it to be a memorable one for my husband and this just put a bit of a dampener on it.
In summary - different kind of hotel, stunning bedrooms and friendly staff. Would definitely stay again but certainly wouldn't eat on board as the price I paid I would have expected a better service and not have to pay the service charge and be overcharged for my dessert.",4,2017,01,17
119,A special place to stay,"I stayed here on business last May and didn't really get to appreciate the place but it was clearly a special place. 
It's main benefits are location as the links to O2 and beyond are extensive and very close by - this time we specifically wanted to be close to the O2 and the cable car. Then there's the uniqueness which the yacht has an abundance of both inside and out. Finally the rooms (king classic river view) are very spacious and have warmth, great day and night views across the water (attention to detail would be to have cleaner port holes though) and good equipment provision with a kettle and separate coffee maker, iron, iron board and a good clean bathroom which doesn't have a bath but that's not an issue for us. 
It should be a 5 out of 5 of even 5 out of 6 but for two issues. One is that both my visits I have never really felt a warm, happy welcome from reception staff. I'm generally as polite as they come which is normally reciprocated but poker face, methodical staff gives me the impression that they are not overwhelmed to be working aboard the yacht. It might be a misperception but it's mine nevertheless. The second is the so called discretionary service charge which I thought the government had actually banned but obviously not yet. The cost of drinks in the bar are what they are, luxury boat, luxury view, luxury prices but adding a so called discretionary tip and providing a receipt which also has a row for further gratuity is putting the customer in a situation that's unnecessary regardless of their worth. ",4,2017,01,17
119,Unique Stay Near the O2,"Imagine staying on a floating, elegant yacht with a small spa and restaurant onboard. Views to the O2 and within walking distance. If you don't prefer to walk to the O2, take the sky tram. I even found a great place that will do your laundry (between the Sonborn and the O2) for less than the hotel's rates. Lawn area across from the Sonborn if you have your children with you. A tranquil stay with a great view. A luxurious feel while being practical. Keep in mind, since this is a yacht the rooms are a bit smaller, but ours had a comfortable bed (can't remember if it was king or queen), a small living area with a good sized TV (sofa folds out into a bed). We also had a nice view from our room and our family of three was quite comfortable.",5,2017,01,17
119,Not so Lush,"My partner and I stayed for one evening following a visit to the London ExCel Boat Show 2017.
Perfect location for the Excel but not clearly sign posted exactly where it is and parking although a short walk away in a multi storey car park (£15 per day)  is still a walk away with luggage!
First impressions are good, nice reception area, impressive  staircase and chandelier.. disappointed to find this was really the only showpiece statement. Reception staff were pleasant. I had booked a classic room at a cost of £140 for the night, no extras, with a dock view.. not sure it's worth the extra money to be waterside. Room was bigger than expected ( as classic rooms have no balcony the room is bigger! Bonus)
Big bed, comfortable with nice pillows. Spotless clean bathroom , good shower, toiletries .. little moan there was only two tissues in the tissue box and no spare toilet roll!  Two complimentary bottles of water ( one still one sparkling) in the minibar fridge that wasn't turned on! 
Nice coffee machine if it had worked... it was replaced so ok! Selection of teas but no biscuits... we would have expected these little touches.
Biggest moan is the contradicting hotel information. On booking we checked out restaurant and dining options. Set A la Carte menu looked great value for money if in fact they weren't changing the menu and it so happened the day we stayed it was off the menu so to speak! Although the in room tablet ( nice touch.. if it showed correct info) said the menu was available. Then again it also said room service pizza was £0.00 Great but when we tried to order... opps free pizza not available 😊 
Too tired to sit for formal meal in the restaurant ( expensive too) so can't comment on the quality but we did have nibbles and a burger in the bar. Still pricey and not particularly fancy.. no garnish. 
Pleasant atmosphere and bar staff very attentive but drinks far too pricey. Cocktails £12+ 
(Tesco and Nisa  local just down the road... go buy a bottle of wine and chill in your nice bedroom) 
Didn't partake of breakfast.. we've eaten all over the world in a variety of star hotels .. £20 per person for breakfast is an unnecessary extravagance. 
In my opinion it was a different option to stay on the Yacht Hotel , not worth any more money to upgrade rooms ( classic is fine) clean, big and comfortable. But delusions of grandeur... to command their prices for food and drinks(even in London ...they have too much competition) they need to up their game and sort out the inconsistency  . Offer luxury and opulence or be just another average different experience. Would I stay again? Yes for location convenience but I would eat elsewhere , plenty of local options and pack a bottle 😊",3,2017,01,16
119,Definitely a little different,"First up, I can't say how much we paid, as my girlfriend paid for this as a birthday surprise.  Nonetheless, I'll review based on the prices I saw, only those on the menus!

We had a cabin on the 4th deck, and with its 6 foot Super King bed, lounge area with newbuck leather 2-seater settee, and balcony the room was very comfortable, nicely appointed.  The bathroom was on the smaller side, but still a decent size, and would class as slightly above basic in terms of it's fitments, which were not cheap, but a long way from luxurious.

We had lunch onboard included in the price.  Although the starter and main course were very good, they were only in line with the reasonably high price tags of between £9 and £12.  We both had a maincourse of fillet steak, marked at £32 on the menu, so we expected this to be superb.  However, whilst it was a good thick steak with no fat or gristle at all, it was a little too dry and not flavoursome enough to attrach it's pricetag.  I've had much better in London for £22-25 (sometimes halved on a Tastecard :-)  ).  So we were a little underwhelmed.

The only other disappointment was the fact you can't get to the front of the boat, only the back where there are two bars and the restaurant.

The staff were beyond fault, and with no exceptions, they provided a 5 star experience.  However, all in, I'd have to rate at about 3.5 to 4 stars.",4,2017,01,16
119,Great taste of luxury,"Perfect location to visit either Excel or the O2, rooms luxurious, including heated bathroom floor, which was great on a cold winter's day.  Lovely view from the restaurant overlooking the city, even in a slightly cloudy day.  Close to the emirates sky line to get to the O2, convenient for London city airport and the dlr.  would definitely stay there again.",5,2017,01,15
119,"Lovely hotel, just awful customer service","Overall service was awful. the lifts were broken when we got there, followed by a power cut (which turns out not to be an isolated incidence to our stay) which then led to the inability to eat in the restaurant, despite managing to fit other guests in (there were only 2 of us). We had planned to eat aboard and not actually leave the hotel, instead we walked round in the bitter cold for something that may have resembled the 3 course meal we had been looking forward too for months. I contacted Sunborn after our stay and got absolutely no response whatsoever, hence the low mark. I can only think that because we got our room at a bargain price that they decided we weren't worthy of the service. Hence the low rating. Lovely place, but anywhere turns into a bad experience when the staff don't care about you.
I can see from other reviews that many praise the staff for their services. It may have been a mixture of small things that went wrong, but the bottom line is that I contacted them with my issues on how we were treated and we didn't even get an acknowledgement. For me it has to be the lowest rating unless someone decides they want to get back to us, but after more than a week, i shall not hold my breath.",1,2017,01,15
119,Highly recommended!,Really enjoyed our stay at the yacht during the London Boat Show 2017. Very nice room and great staff! Extra points to the bartenders Nico and Jay for excellent drinks and service! Definitely coming back! Thank you! ,5,2017,01,14
119,Great rooms and location,"Celebrated my 30th birthday here and had a great stay, although no upgrades as some suggested they had received on request. I did get a birthday card but nothing else. The rooms were beautiful, the hotel interior in general was really nice. The bar area was comfortable and there were great reviews over the Thames at sunrise and sunset, on a clear day the setting really is beautiful. There is plenty near by to enjoy, including restaurants and bars and even a local tesco. I would recommend the nearby Lebanese restaurant. However l, I wouldn't recommend the Lands End restaurant on site for your stay and have done a separate review on my experience there. I think it could go some way in improving the quality and standards of the food to match that of the hotel. There's better food to be eaten across London in comparison for the same price. I would return for a stay at the hotel but I would arrange to book meals etc elsewhere. ",5,2017,01,14
119,what an experience,"A gorgeous place to stay, service was excellent, lovely room, the bed was comfy and the food was good, Molten Brown bathroom products, lovely views over the dock and docklands in the morning (even in the fog) and a bottle of Merlot in the room - what more could you ask for?? We'd both highly recommend giving it all a whirl!",5,2017,01,14
119,Leaves a bitter taste!,"After seeing this beautiful hotel on our visit to the London boat show last January, we decided to book it for our visit this year.

Whilst you cannot dispute how lovely this yacht hotel is with its beautiful reception area, lovely rooms, cleanliness and great views, unfortunately it falls short in many other aspects.

Firstly, the staff are very unwelcoming on the reception and made the checking in process very complicated. 

We did change rooms because we were on the first floor with views of the dock land but because we were so low, all you could see through a small porthole window was people's feet! The room was lovely but so dark and gloomy it made us feel claustrophobic. We upgraded to the fifth floor with river view which cost £70.  The new room was lovely.

We would have loved to have spent a few hours in the bar having a few relaxing drinks but the bar prices are extortionate, they also stuck an 11.5% service charge on top! Two small beers £11.50. Even at London prices this is ridiculous and whilst we don't mind paying a bit more for something special, it is the feeling that you are being ripped off that leaves a sour taste in the mouth. We decided to go across the square to another bar.

Dinner was disappointing, very limited choice, sticky toffee pudding was more like a sticky brick!! No cheese and biscuits!

Breakfast - be prepared to pay 19.50 per head! It was terrible. We would have expected table service for the price but it was buffet style. No eggs, food was only Luke warm, by the time they brought the eggs we'd almost finished eating. There were several waiters loitering around but none of them seemed very willing to do much, we had to clear our own table and get our own milk for the coffee.

We will be staying in the Ibis next year!",3,2017,01,13
119,Boat show stay,"This is a lovely hotel in a great location,however we found the prices extortionate.£11 for two 330ml bottles of peroni,
The breakfast (20 a head) was simply terrible.The food was luke warm at best and the service was none existent.
I had to find condiments,butter and milk from other tables as the staff,when asked just wondered off certainly not justifying the 11.5% service charge.
We have had much better experiences in other local hotels.
This was our first and last visit to this hotel",3,2017,01,13
119,Yacht in town,"I travel often to London and pay visit to my son who lives in this magnificient city.
I used go to South Kensington, but he recently moved and I had the chance to visit different areas of London.
This time I picked Sunborn London, a Yacht used as a Hotel, no engines, in Royal Victoria Dock, close to Excel London.
It is a new and modern area, with spectacular views and ultramodern buildings still being constructed.
Not far from the Bridge of London and the City.
The Hotel is perfect, service excellent, rooms tidy, WiFi works very well, breakfast excellent.
The Hamburgers at the bar not special.
Connectivity is good, close to DLR station.
Service friendly and professional. 
I did not try the Restaurant as it was fully booked.
In general.a good experience, I would repeat it.
Price reasonable with the level and the location of the Hotel, much.better than South Kensington.
It was fun!
",4,2017,01,11
119,Time for a refit,"We have been staying on the Sunborn for the last 3 years. It is in the perfect location for London City Airport and easy access to the centre of London using the DLR or the clipper. We love the uniqueness of staying on a ""yacht"" in the nations capital. 
The breakfast is comprehensive and the staff are very attentive. The cocktail bar is a great place for a post dinner chill out.
The rooms are very comfortable with large beds, excellent powerful showers and tea and coffee making facilities. The room was meticulously cleaned and the staff were all extremely accommodating.
We think the management may have changed recently as things don't seem to be quite the same as last year. The room we had this time had a large number of bad stains on the carpet, facings in some of the public areas were damaged or missing and a number of under lights were out so perhaps it's time for a refit?
We will go back again the next time we are in town.",3,2017,01,11
119,That Sinking Feeling,"That sinking feeling

Date of stay: Night of 28th December 2016.

Perhaps three stars could be seen as a bit harsh for this London hotel sold as luxury accommodation in a cruise ship setting but then circumstances may have had a part to play. What did result in my downgrading of this hotel, however, was the poor service and apparent lack of contingency or training for the staff and for this there is no excuse. 

We had been looking forward to staying on the Sunborn for some time, especially as it had been described to my wife and myself as a luxurious experience on a cruise liner that does not actually go anywhere. Cruise liner this was not and for anyone who has been on a cruise with one of the premium cruise companies then I would advise that you look at this in a different light. Having said this we did have a spacious, clean and comfortable room and had it not been for the poor service and unfortunate circumstances of the evening then we may have felt differently about our stay. Certainly by the morning and after a walk by The Royal Victoria Dock it did seem more affable than first impressions the previous day. So what caused such a poor first impression?

Having found the Sunborn (it would have been so much easier if there had been instructions saying head for the Excel centre as the hotel is next to it) we then waited patiently at the reception desk.  This took some time, despite there only being one person in front of us.  However the receptionist insisted on personally taking the customer (there are no porters!) he was serving to an area of the ship that this customer was enquiring about, leaving us waiting to check in. The same receptionist then left us waiting again, when he returned, as he then answered the phone despite the fact that we had, by this time, been waiting some time. I suppose it gave me time to look at the reception area focusing on a plaque stating that this hotel had received the award of excellence from Trip Advisor (really!). Eventually we were severed. As we had prepaid for our stay this process should have been straight forward and QUICK but alas there again this was not to be. Despite producing a printed confirmation of our stay (including the fact that we had pre paid) and the electronic version on my phone the receptionist insisted that the stay had not been paid for. I pointed out the wording Pre Paid but still he felt it necessary to leave us waiting again whilst he consulted with a manager. Five minutes later he returned informing me that yes I had already paid and that this payment going through as we spoke? Eventually, a good twenty minutes after arriving on board we made our way to our room. We had been in the room for less than three minutes when all the lights went out. We checked by looking out but could see the Excel Centre clearly lit and upon looking out the door saw another guest also looking to see if there was an obvious reason for the power failure. Clearly the problem was on the Sunborn. We waited a good ten minutes, thank heavens for the flash lights that smart phones are equipped with these days, but no information was forth coming. I decided to try and find out more and ventured out into the corridor. The emergency lighting appeared to be working so I made my way to where I thought reception was, passing clearly bemused cleaners aimlessly wheeling their trolleys. I really thought that maybe I had actually stumbled onto the set of a disaster film! The sliding doors in the corridor appeared to be working so I was able to make some headway (excuse the pun). Ironically I came to a mechanically locked door from my side and opened it for a manager who was trying to gain access from the other side; he then scuttled off before I was able to ask what was happening. No one shouted “cut” or “action” so this was real in some bizarre way. Eventually I reached a candle lit reception. The receptionist started apologising for the loss of power. I stopped her and stated that mechanical break downs do happen but what was their contingency plan, especially as it was a cold night and the heating had also gone off. Unfortunately she was unable to give me any information regarding this apart from saying that it was being looked into and perhaps I could bring my wife to reception for a complementary drink. I can only describe the scene as chaotic as clearly none of the staff knew what to do in such an emergency and the guests had been given no information being left, literally, in the dark. As I was about to leave the area the lights came back on and the receptionist gave a sigh of relief and stated that everything should be okay now as the power failure was unlikely to reoccur. Another five minutes saw my wife and myself sitting in the bar area sipping our complementary drink. We had been there approximately ten minutes when we were plunged into darkness again. Shouts from other guests of “I’ll have another brandy please” failed to relieve the tension so we decided to get off the ship and go into London as soon as possible. We managed to gain entry to our room but were unable to shower and change properly before leaving as there was no light. The power returned as we were leaving. When we returned later that night the power appeared to have been restored.

Problems
•	Poor initial service at reception
•	A complete lack of information to the guests about the power failure either during or after the event
•	A sense of panic in the staff as clearly there was no contingency plan.

I would be interested to know if such power failures have happened in the past or, indeed, since our visit. 

Would I book again? Probably, as potentially the stay could have been a lot better, circumstances permitting.",3,2017,01,11
119,In town for business,"Stayed at this property as was in town on business at Excel which is 1 minute walk. The hotel is nice however, our cabin floor was quite scratched. The room was well appointed and reasonable size as you expect on a ship,  there were no wine glasses in the room however, apart from this it was perfect. Staff were very friendly and helpful, good property to stay in and will stay there again when in London on business next time.",4,2017,01,11
119,NIGHT OUT WITH MY WONDERFUL GIRLFRIEND,"This was her birthday present amongst others, and she thoroughly enjoyed it, food was very good, as was service and the surroundings typical of a luxury yacht, there processes caused me a hick up, as I wanted flowers to be handed out at the end of the evening, they found this difficult, so I got a local florist to deliver for me, and all was good.",4,2017,01,09
119,New Years Eve stay,"My boyfriend and I stayed at the Sunborn for New Year's Eve. The hotel is easy to find (the boat is hard to miss!) and about a 5 minute walk from the nearest DLR station. The hotel really does give you the ""wow"" factor, the sheer size of the ship and the beautiful staircase in reception. 
Our check in was prompt and we went to explore our room straight away. We had a classic double suite with a riverside view. The riverside view was lovely and our room was spacious. The coffee machine was a nice touch and the bathroom was modern and clean. The hotel had left us a personal note to enjoy our stay along with a token gift from Fortnum and Mason. V.impressed! 
One thing to mention is that the carpet is quite tired, but nothing to complain about. 
We decided to have our dinner off the boat but we did enjoy a drink to see in the New Year. The prices are on the steep side but it was so lovely to be on the deck and watching the fireworks to bring in the New Year. 
With slightly sore heads we checked out with ease.The staff are very friendly and helpful.  I would return to this hotel again as a treat. The prices are expensive, but it was to be expected on New Year's eve!",4,2017,01,09
119,"Beautiful rooms, beautiful views","I came here with my girlfriend for new years eve. Our room cost the gross national product of San Marino- I went for a king room with river view, which bumped up the cost- to book, but it was worth it. 

The room was huge, the bed was very comfortable, and as promised, we had a view of the Thames from the large, landscape window. There was a stain on the carpet, which had been cleaned but not removed entirely, but why did that matter? 

The bathroom was a good size and the shower was wonderful, even if I was too hungover and almost weeping in pain on new years day to fully appreciate. We didn't have dinner on the boat, since they were doing an extortionate special festive menu, (we ate elsewhere) but we did go and have drinks up on the deck at midnight, which offers views almost as stunning as my girlfriend, of the Thames, Millennium Dome and City of London. 

The ornate staircase and chandelier in the lobby is a marvel to gaze upon, and the staff at reception are polite and efficient. A perfect place to take a loved one for a birthday surprise or a dirty weekend. 

A short but sweet stay, no faults.",5,2017,01,09
119,Background music from outer space!,"Excellent accommodation & lovely surroundings, however the background music in the bar is simply awful. It's a mix of garage type out of beat unknown music, it makes you feel very edgy and unable to relax, it constantly distracts you. Basically have a drink and go. We would have dined there but the music gets so under your skin and is heavily irritating. 
Simply this would prevent me staying again as I do like a drink in the bar and to relax with friends. Not really an option here unless into every strange tunes. Sorry but true!
",2,2017,01,08
119,Amazing overnight stay aboard the floating hotel,"This was my second trip to the sunborn yacht hotel. This current visit was for an  overnight stay for a birthday treat.
On arrival aboard the sunborn yacht, we were greeted by helpful and professional  staff.  The member of staff who checked us in on arrival made a point of finding out if we had visited the hotel before, which was a nice touch.  We were also given complimentary breakfast as we had previously visited the hotel. 
The room was clean and comfortable with all the usual touches in find in your hotel room.
If you are staying at the hotel, I would recommend checking out the restaurant.  Although the restaurant is not large, it is worth booking a reservation when you arrive.  
The quality of the food in the restaurant was of good quality and the service was excellent.  After dinner you can relax and have some nice cocktails  in the hotel bar, which is open until 2.00am weekend, especially if you are there to celebrate a special ocassion.
Although this is quite an expensive hotel, for celebrating a special occasions, it worth the visit.
Highly recommended!!!!!!",5,2017,01,08
119,Afternoon tea,I booked the afternoon tea for 6 of us to celebrate our Aunt's 89 birthday and wanted to make it special. It certainly was! The staff are amazing especially Lency our waitress. There was an incredible selection of tea to choose from and you are not limited to a single cup. We were even allowed to have some more sandwiches as they were so nice. There was a lovely selection of cakes to complete the cream tea. Lency even bought out a birthday candle in some treats so we could sing happy birthday.  The view of the dock and the cable car was lovely but it was a grey January so would be better in summer. Thanks for making Aunt's birthday so memorable. (She had to keep a tea bag as a souvenir.),5,2017,01,08
119,Different,"Stayed here with friends after visiting the boat show. We thought it would be appropriate considering the reason for our visit.  Lovely rooms and lovely entrance.  Check in was a little slow as we arrived at approx 3pm which is the regular checkin time and lots of others had the same idea.  The bed was really comfortable, but I didn't like the coffee machine as it made strong coffee, I wish there had been just regular/decaf coffee.  Service in the bar was really good, beer and cider prices reasonable, but spirits, cocktails and soft drinks are rather pricey.  We had a burger and fries (again pricey, but very nice) and a chicken and mayonnaise triple sandwich with fries (pricey for a sarnie).  Fries on two of the meals were only luke warm.  Bar prices have a discrectionary 12.5% service charge added, which again can make a big difference to your final bill.  We paid extra for breakfast as there was an offer of eating before a certain time cost only £7.50 per head.  We got a table easily, but found they were a little tight.  The toasters weren't working and I was stood for a good 5/10 mins before another guest told me that there was a problem, the staff never said anything even though they were milling about.  There was NO brown sauce for the fried breakfast which I think is MOST disappointing!! and the Xmas tree was still up with the lights on!!  I would recommend as somewhere to stay which is different but there is a real lack of restaurants nearby so you may have to venture further.  Try to book this hotel when you can find an offer, it can be quite pricey.",4,2017,01,08
119,new year,"stayed on-board the sunborn again for new years eve , and had a fantastic night . The gala dinner was first class , rooms were amazing , staff were excellent , entertainment was very good . will definitely be returning very soon",5,2017,01,08
119,Flash & Friendly,"Attended an event here, very big & comfortable rooms, impressive bars & restaurants and good food plus novelty factor of it being a yacht.

Overall impressive and enjoyable place to stay, standard rooms are big & comfortable, some more expensive rooms have outside terrace/access.  Good WiFi freely available everywhere onboard",5,2017,01,07
119,Christmas day,I took my mother as a treat here for Christmas day lunch and overnight stay we had rooms with balcony facing the riverside we felt truly blessed to spend Christmas day on here with a very reasonable priced beautiful Christmas day lunch the staff were friendly and helpful and made it a Christmas to remember I'd love to return in better weather we even received a Christmas card from the staff thank you for a memorable quirky rare Christmas treat ,5,2017,01,05
119,An Amazing Stay,"My wife booked this as a suprise for my Christmas present. It consisted of Bed Breakfast and Evening Meal. The entrance to the reception is spectacular with a lovely staircase surrounding a chandelier.

The Executive Dock facing room was lovely, very spacious with a balcony looking out over the Excel Centre. There was a fridge in the room which was handy to keep our Champagne nice and cool.

The evening meal we had was very nice, not a cheap place by any means but very good quality.

The breakfast was good, plenty of choice from cold buffet to hot food with a lovely view over the Docks towards the Cable Cars.

A lovely hotel with very nice staff and we will return again.",5,2017,01,05
119,Unique Birthday Treat,"Having researched and seen some of the reviews on here, both positive and negative i opted to book the 'Romantic Getaway Package' for my wifes 40th Birthday treat. I have to say we weren't disappointed. Yes its a 30-40 min journey from Central London via Tube and DLR but my wifes surprise upon arrival was worth it. The Yacht itself looks stunning. First impression of reception with the magnificent staircase was amazing. Check in staff aswell as all staff we encountered on board were polite and helpful.  We chose an Executive Riverview room and i have to say it was worth it. The view over the river from our balcony to Canary Wharf in the distance was magnificent. 
We had a sandwich in the bar area upon arrival which was tasty if a little expensive when viewing the menu, however when the plates arrived, the portion size was huge, so in reality worth the money. Tips do get added onto the bill in the bar area but we were happy to pay for the table service we received. Bar staff were very attentive and meant i never had to leave my seat. 
A 3 course evening meal was included in our package and i have to say i was impressed with the standard of food provided and complimentary glass of champagne. 
Breakfast was simply amazing. The choice and quality of food on offer surpassed our expectations. 
Rather than using the DLR and Tube to get back into Central London the next day we opted for the 5 minute walk over to the Emirates Cable Car. Fantastic experience and views across the city. From there a short walk to Grenwich Pier to pick up one of the Thames Clippers boats for the 40 minute journey all the way to Westminster. Great way to relax and enjoy the sights of the city from the river. 
Overall a fantastic experience that my wife loved.",5,2017,01,05
119,Very Good,"First time stayed here and on a yacht 

The executive river side room was large, comfortable large bed, good bathroom and lots of wood 

We had a snack in the bar and a drink overlooking the river which was nice

We didn't eat here and breakfast at £20 each seemed a bit expensive adding to that reviews of breakfast I'd seen weren't very good 

The staff seemed a bit short and sharp at reception like they were in a rush but there were only us and another couple to been checked in 

I would stay here again and it's something different 

I have pictures too ",5,2017,01,04
119,A luxury yacht without the inconvenience of going cruising!,"The Sunborn Yacht Hotel is somewhat of an paradox. It is in every way a sleek, modern, ocean-going cruise liner with all the associated luxuries of grand cabins, open sun-decks, superb dining and ultra-attentive cabin staff and stewards. Yet this magnificent ship has (so I believe) no engines, other than any which may power ancillaries, and is never intended to venture back onto the high seas since its delivery. Built in Finland (as with its sister ship which now resides in Gibraltar) it is moored permanently in the Royal Victoria Dock alongside the Excel Centre, west of London.

It is luxurious, well-appointed and quite pricey, but so one would expect. I imagine that when there is a major event on at the Excel it is nigh impossible to get a cabin but at other times deals are offered that compare favorably with local conventional hotels of far less quality and novelty. 

If you want to test out the experience before booking your stay why not call in for an afternoon tea which, enhanced with the spectacular views of Canary Wharf, the Dome and all the other sights, is quite as enjoyable as tea at The Ritz.

The Sunborn is situated in a remote part of London (a common complaint about the adjacent Excel Centre) but it actually has good rail links through the Docklands Light Railway, is close to London's City Airport (but not noisily so) and there are always Uber cabs and black taxis about. The Yacht Hotel is also within a few hundred yard's walk from the Emirates' Cable Car which is quite as impressive as the London Eye. It carries you at high level from north to south of the River Thames, crossing almost above the Millennium Dome, and is worth experiencing both during the day and at night when one can see the whole of London lit up. Once south of the river it is a long walk or a short cab ride to Greenwich for the Maritime Museum (free entry!) and the recently (and quite spectacularly) restored Cutty Sark tea clipper. When in Greenwich look for the brass stars set in the pavements which mark the line of Zero Longitude (Nought degrees, where world time starts). From Greenwich Pier you can pick up a River Taxi which will take you in stages up to Westminster Pier, the London Eye and the Houses of Parliament.",5,2017,01,04
119,Not special enough,"Stayed for 2 nights st the end of December, was booked as a special birthday treat for my two daughters birthdays, an 18th and 21st. The first problem was the wrong post code that was emailed to me, which took me miles away from my destination. We found the correct post code and continued, unfortunately we had difficulty finding the car park and tried for 30 minutes to contact reception. Finally we made it and walked to the hotel, we were welcomed and shown to our room. We requested extra pillows as we had only been allocated one each, there is a Tablet with hotel information on and the option was selected for extra feather pillows, 2 hours later I went to Reception to be told that they don't offer feather pillows (I politely suggested they check the options on the room tablet). We slept reasonably well, the rooms are very warm. Breakfast the next day was disappointing, it is a tiny restaurant and was not able to cope with the number of people, we had to wait 20 minutes for a table. We had to wait for all of the food to be replenished and it seemed chaotic at times. Overall due to our experience and the location we would not go again. I have emailed all of my concerns to Sunborn and await their response.",3,2017,01,04
119,Put this on your to do list,"Tip number 1,,,,,I booked this through ""Secret Escapes"" getting the bed and breakfast plus 3 course evening meal with Champagne deal, this also gave me an executive room all for less than the official Sunborn web page deal for the same deal but with a basic room,,, 
Tip number 2,,,,, Tell your partner you're staying at the Ibis (Just up from Sunborn) and get a pic of his/her face when you declare your practical joke like I did.
The Sunborn is absolutely jaw dropping, it oozes class, and delivers just that. Our room was virtually at the bow of the yacht on level 3 giving us a good view and a balcony but in December its too cold to fully maximise. Perfectly adequate for the 1 night we stayed. Our evening meal was fantastic, with a reasonable selection considering the deal gave us a limited selection. As the restaurant is at the stern you get a great view of the London skyline and Canary Wharf. Being the 21st of December we had the added magic of the Christmas spirit and decorations. 
Breakfast was exceptional, Sooo much on offer and plenty of attentive staff to make sure you are completely satisfied. 
I can't recommend this experience enough - This was my partners birthday and I'm sure she won't forget it.... Especially as she was inwardly grumpy when I told her we were staying at the Ibis..... Ha :)",5,2017,01,04
119,birthday stay !!,"Stayed here for my birthday in December what can I say!?  From the moment upon entering the vessel with glamorous staircase and being welcomed by the reception staff what a way to start! The service throughout the stay, from the reception, bar And restaurant staff was touching as all members wished me a Happy Birthday. The service from one particular member stood out was from the Guest Relations Manager Maryiam whom lovingly arranged a personal letter and chocolates for me and my friends to enjoy. For breakfast plenty of choices were available from pastries, fruit and the full english!  Very easy access to with the DLR with a few minutes away. Would definitely recommend a visit!!!",5,2017,01,03
119,Nice but not special,"We booked 4 rooms for two nights. Firstly not much of a deal and breakfast is expensive so we ate elsewhere. The fixed price dinner menu is OK price-wise but finishes too early really. Nice rooms. Overpriced drinks, albeit nicely presented. Gin is £8, plus the tonic!

Everyone is pleasant but to be honest we expected better. Better attention in the bar. Ideally someone asking a rather loud lady to stop swearing in the corner and go to bed. Recognising on check out that we had spent a thousand pounds with them and getting more than 'do you want a receipt?' on check out. 

We have stayed before and thought it would be a nice treat to bring the extended family. We would get the same service anywhere to be honest, and whilst this is different, it is somewhere we would like to use again but probably won't given the rather impersonal service received this time. Last time was a little better. 

They really should 'go overboard' on service if they are to compete with a lot of other hotels close-by. 

Parking is dreadful, with no luggage drop-off and the need to park in Excel and walk. 

Nice in summer. A bit noisy with the airport close by and worth a one-off stay for something special. For the regular traveler it is not overly expensive for London prices I guess and has good transport links with two DLR stations nearby and Excel..",3,2017,01,03
119,Can't wait to go back!,From booking to leaving the staff and the hotel were fantastic. The staff were so friendly throughout. They knew it was my boyfriends birthday and we arrived to white truffles waiting for us in our room and a personalised letter. The room and other areas of the boat were so clean. The breakfast was really tasty and was a real variety for all. Would love to stay again!! ,5,2017,01,02
119,Boxing Day lunch set menu ,"My husband, adult son and I went to have lunch on board this lovely yacht Hotel on Boxing Day 2016. We chose the set three course menu  at the amazing price of just £22.50 per head. Both the choice and quality of the food was excellent. The portion size was quite sufficient and the service was excellent. 
Whilst the wine and alcohol are a bit pricey they are probably more typical of good London Hotel prices.
We have been on board before for drinks but not to eat. The exceptional price of this set menu would definitely encourage us to return, although I am not sure how long this set menu option is on offer for?",5,2017,01,02
119,New Year's Eve to remember ,"Wow, what can I say my boyfriend (now fiancée) booked this for New Year's Eve and it was amazing from start to finish. Upon arrival we were greeted with a very warm welcome. We had a classic river view room which was gorgeous. The room was massive and had all the amenities that you would want coffee machine, fridge, complimentary toiletries and plenty of towels. We had already booked a meal at a local restaurant so didn't sample the gala menu onboard. We came back after dinner to watch the jazz band and singer in the lounge and it was great. We also went up to the top deck to see in new year with the Dj and also watched the fireworks around London from the deck. After a very romantic proposal which I accepted we went back to the jazz lounge for some more drinks. The waiting staff were very friendly and came over to chat to us and wish every one a happy new year. What an amazing experience and would highly recommend the sunborn and am looking forward to booking again xx ",5,2017,01,01
119,Night out with friends,Great place to go for a night out with friends. We've been to the bar to have some drinks and we were amazed by the design of the place and by the quality of the staff service. The bartender made some excellent cocktails and the food was delicious. The staff was very friendly and promptly.,5,2017,01,01
119,amazing night spent just after Christmas....,"Luxury from the minute you step on board , staff attention excellent they all appear to enjoy their role genuinely  friendly and not working from a script , genius chef Frank Katemesha prepared an amazing evening meal , relaxing drinks in the bar after , Irish coffee to die for ….. The rooms are huge and luxuriously appointed; my suggestion is not a room port side looking over Excel,
Buffet breakfast served till 10.30 ensure a lie in! Recommend ……..cannot fault just go and enjoy.",5,2017,01,01
119,A Great Hotel,"I fairly enjoyed my stay at Sunbourn, the food was good and the room was clean and spacious. However I came across 2 problems. We accidentally went in the Service lift and it's not clear which is service and which is normal lift. But my second problem was it was quite far away from central London and takes us a while to get there but apart from that it was a great stay.",4,2017,01,01
119,30th December,"Was disappointed with our stay after being very excited about the visit London for the night with the kids. Firstly check in was delayed and we did not get into the room until after 3. This was rectified with a free drink but still annoying after paying £300 for the room. 
We also had no air conditioning which I contacted reception three times about but it never got fixed. We had to turn it off in the end as it was boiling with it on. Hence we had a very poor nights sleep including the children who were up at 5.30 as they were too hot. Again we got £20 taken off the room for this but as it spoilt our whole time in the room this was not really acceptable.
Apart from this breakfast was good. Watch for service charge on drinks from bar also as although this is not compulsory to pay it is not clear.
",2,2016,12,31
119,Birthday treat,"I was a bit disappointed I expected a better service with the cost of this hotel. Our breakfast was empty dishes, our tea took over half an hour to come so we left before it was served. The room was a nice size but pretty average, the carpet had marks all over it. The location was good for the 02 apart from that it was a very quiet area not much going on.",3,2016,12,31
119,Night before new year,"Great place to stay food was excellent the rooms were very clean tidy and spacious the staff were attentive to the last detail breakfast was excellent and non rushed you could eat as much as you possibly could the views from the dining room were stunning as was that from our room
I would recommend this as a.place to stay if you are flying out of city or visiting excel it's a smaller version of a cruise liner but well worth a visit to tick off the bucket list",5,2016,12,31
119,Rubbish,Breakfast was awful. Bread had mould on it and no one was interested when everyone complained. No entertainment seeing it was Christmas and on a boat. Will not ever be coming back. Tried to charge an extra £50 for a kids fold up bed.,1,2016,12,30
119,Two Night stay,"We booked as we have stayed on Sunborn Gibraltar and we wanted to see if the experience was as good. We had a river view executive room, it would be lovely with the balcony in warmer weather, the view was still good though.
The staff were very attentive, we checked in early and they stored our bags safely whilst we explored the area. When we went to our room our bags were already there.
We ate in the restaurant both evenings, we booked via the in room tablet (if you book before 7 pm there is a special rate menu). The food was very good. 
The reason for 4 stars is the fact that breakfast was an extra cost, when you are paying for the room (we booked directly with Sunborn) you would expect breakfast to be included.
You are asked to pay a £40 per person when checking in. This could be clearer in the booking details.",4,2016,12,30
119,A very 'Tight Ship' which doesn't meet the standard it aspires to.,"I've just returned from a two night stay with my teenage son.  I chose this accommodation for the novelty value.  Apart from being a traveller, I've been a manager in the hotel sector for 15 years and I'm very observant of customer service levels and standards of accommodation, aware of operational costs and methods of savings. 

Despite sending a reminder email within 24 hours of check-in and receiving a reassuring response, the twin-bedded room I'd booked 2 months previously was not prepared and we were shown to a double.  (2045) On returning, to reception, tired and hungry, I was told that it wouldn't be possible to make up twin beds in the allocated room and we would be allocated another (2025) if we would wait just a few minutes in the bar area where we could get a drink.  We did get a drink and were charged £7.50 for a cola and a soda water: a complimentary beverage may have been more appropriate whilst we were kept waiting half an hour.  (There are higher costs to providing a twin room rather than a double and some hotels avoid this deliberately as frequently short-stay guests will arrive so weary that they'll just accept the double and save the hotel the inconvenience and laundry bills.)  This also happens with 'hard to sell' rooms which may be noisy, cramped or have awful views: it's common practice to place guests in those first and hope no one complains.  Our new room was one of slightly larger rooms to facilitate the twin beds but otherwise very similar.  

Not a grievance, just a useful hint for other travellers; the decor is dark and dated with lots of shiny wood which would have been popular in the 80s / 90s.  There is nothing luxurious about these rooms they are just hotel rooms, hotel beds, a not very comfy 2 seat sofa, wardrobe, bedside drawers, TV and a small fridge which never really got cold. The two small glass bottles of water with a 'compliments' note were hardly a generous offering at the price paid.

The tea tray and cups had to be fished out from the dark recesses of a low cupboard.  Perhaps they hope guests won't find it and order Room Service for a cuppa instead.  Everything from Room Service comes at a £4 additional 'delivery' cost.  There are no extra pillows or blankets in the room (usually a basic) and with Sunborn's prices and pretensions to luxury, if you expected a bathrobe - these are actually available at £95 per robe.  
It would have been nice to have a two drinking glasses in the bathroom instead of one (one day 2 still only 1 glass) after all we were provided with two complimentary bottles of water. There wasn't a note pad or pen, again standard fare and one of those small conveniences much appreciated when one has an itinerary to plan.  Sunborn really do run a 'tight ship' and I believe, take advantage that many of these very small conveniences may go unnoticed by giddy guests who are out to eat, drink and be merry.  They might notice next morning when the water from the washbasin is dripping on their feet because of the leaking plumbing underneath though.

We didn't sample the cuisine 'on board' as breakfast wasn't included in the price and we were out all day in the centre until late evening.  Sunborn's breakfast from a buffet service at £18.50 per head, doesn't compare too well with the freshly cooked options available around the corner by the Emirates Airline from £4.95.  The dining room is rather dull anyway after you get past the dazzling chandelier in the stairwell.

Summing up, the Sunborn is a mediocre hotel in a boat, permanently moored in an East End wharf off the Thames.  Once through the door you will not be aware you are not in a building.  You will however be aware that this is in no way like any cruise ships you may have travelled on.  It stops being a boat at the door but if you're in one of the marginally cheaper rooms on the 'dock' side, you will eventually realise that as it is actually a boat as all the electricity on board, 24 hours a day, is coming from the enormous 'truck sized' generator parked on the quayside.  It's incredibly noisy and there's nothing you can do about it.  

The Sunborn is transparently a money making machine where, customer service and accommodation is trimmed for efficiency.  It's as good as a Premier Inn but no better.  Clearly there are people who've and had a great time and enjoyed spending on the additional options available.

Sunborn trades on its novelty, being a boat in the East of London with a view of Canary Wharf at night.  It's convenient for nearby London City Airport as you can see the runway lights from the quayside footbridge and hear the roar of planes taking off.  No doubt it benefits from the relatively affordable cost of its mooring compared with an actual plot of London land: the owners must enjoy great profit margins with all the penny pinching as well. 

It is the only place I've ever stayed where I wasn't asked if I'd enjoyed my stay as I checked out.",2,2016,12,30
119,Woe not Wow!,"My husband and I stayed at the Sunborn for 3 nights, including our wedding night, in early November. On arriving at about 2am, after our wedding party, the receptionist who checked us in treated us like an inconvenience and the welcome was as frosty as the weather in the dock outside.

My husband had booked our stay as a surprise for me and asked for a bottle of champagne to be in our room on arrival. There was no sign of it - not a major problem as we had drunk our fill of it during the day, but it reflected a lack of interest, poor customer care and attention to detail that was evident throughout our stay until the day we left. As with many other reviewers, we then checked the minibar for a nightcap and found only two bottles of water! Still, probably good for limiting the hangovers!

We had dinner in the restaurant on the second night. I attempted to iron a shirt for my new husband (showing willing to begin with!!) before we dressed for dinner, but the iron was pathetic and when I finally got through to someone to ask for another (I rang every extension and it took about 10 minutes to get a reply), they brought me another iron of the same quality - no steam irons on board apparently (I swear I took better travel irons on holidays in the 80's!)  There were few other diners and the dining room was chilly, so no one saw his crumpled shirt as we couldn't bring ourselves to take our jackets off. When we mentioned that it was quite cold, waiting staff were disinterested and we were told there was nowhere warmer to relocate to, so we had no inclination to linger. The food however was good.

On the positive side, our room was warm and pleasant with fabulous views, a lovely, big, comfy bed and good facilities apart from those I've been critical of above. The reception area as you board the yacht is impressive and we enjoyed the novelty value of being on a vessel without an engine, going nowhere!

Overall however, staff on the Suborn were business-like rather than warm and personable,  despite trade being quiet over  the weekend - the only exception to this was on the day we checked out, when the yacht was packed with punters staying for the Travel Trade Fair at Excel. The irony wasn't wasted on us and the Sunborn has some way to go to do right by leisure rather than corporate customers. We had a memorable stay as it was the first few days of our honeymoon, but sadly, we will remember the staff and some services for nothing more than their mediocrity. Must try harder!",3,2016,12,29
119,Not sure. ,"We went to to the boat as a last minute surprise for our family.
Boat was not full but unable to book a table in the restaurant fully booked. Not happy.  The bar and eating areas would in my opinion be able to coup with a full boat.
Bar closed at midnight 

Lots of bars and restaurants in the area. ",2,2016,12,29
119,Beautiful,Stayed here with my partner for my 25th birthday and had a phenomenal stay. The rooms and the hotel in general was absolutely amazing and the room service breakfast was divine. Would highly recommend this hotel for any length of stay.,5,2016,12,29
119,Christmas Trip to London,"I booked here as a Christmas treat for my partner, and we weren't disappointed.
It's a little way out from central London, but well worth going the extra distance.
The rooms, we booked a standard without specifying 'waterside' but we're lucky enough to get a room with a view of the water, are spacious and luxurious. Soft, deep pile carpets, a huge bed, and plenty of space.
The breakfast was incredible, but the best for us was a hot chocolate in the bar the night before. If you go here, you simply HAVE to try the hot chocolate - yummy!!
It's well worth a visit to the Sunborn",4,2016,12,29
119,Sunborn London,"Great boutique style hotel on a permanently moored yacht! 
Very close to the excel centre and the Emirates cable cars... 
Local eateries and also the LDR (London dock lands railway) is nearby to get into central London with relative ease...
Rooms are luxurious for a four star hotel, restaurant is quite small.. Good security with card access to lift and room floors..
Good views if you have a waterside room.. Dock view can be bland views... Nice for romantic weekend with London trip.. Or if you are using the excel! ",5,2016,12,27
119,Massive Disappointed More Fun At A Funeral,"What can I say about my stay on board Sunborn London  “Not Much” First I booked via a booking app and they got my dates wrong by one week and that’s not Sunborn London’s fault in any way and they were happy to change the dates once I cancelled the other date saying they could find a room for us but it would be some £100 more emm ok but we will throw in breakfast for free. Moving on we had a room which was ok but not that great for £210 for the night plus they would need to take a £40 on our card for mini bar/bar, But being told it was one of the better rooms I would hate to see the not so better rooms? I must say I did check via an app re booking this hotel later in my room and was offered it cheaper!  On walking to our rooms 2 food trays left outside other rooms, which was unsightly and smelled of chips not good for a 4/5 star hotel. The mini bar had 2 bottles of water?? . When we checked in we were told the main bar closed at 12. So we arrived 11.15 and it was not that busy but there were staff around so we gave our orders and also asked is they’re any bar food? And was told no sorry kitchen is closed but it would be better to get to our room and order room service. Then some 20 minutes had passed and no drinks yet then I had to go to the bar and ask for my drinks, which was now 11.50. After leaving the bar we went to our room and sat down to go through the room service via a tablet in the room we order honey roast ham sandwich it maybe a baguette but in multigrain please and a chicken with avocado on white it did come with fries at a cost of £12 per sandwich. We waited over 40 minutes. And when it turned up I was asleep and being woken up to find 2 white breaded towers of poor quality sandwich’s which one should have been in multigrain and the chips were cold no salt or pepper or sauces. Which when telling the waiter about the long wait! He said we would not be not charged to our room that’s ok but I’m not looking for a free sandwich. If I was the management I would not offer such rubbish at any cost and supply fresh good produce and stop thinking we are paying a premium for being on a floating boat. in the morning the breakfast which was a buffet and I seen better buffets in a 2 star Hotel, Lack of everything with dirty spoons near the beans doors below open so hitting my leg and staff looking around trying to look busy? . Would I visit this place again? I would rather sleep in a box at the side of this boat",1,2016,12,25
119,Enjoyed one night stay ,"This is a really nice place. Booked it with a bit of trepidation as wasn't sure what to expect but definitely wasn't disappointed.
The yacht lives up to it's description.
The room was spacious and clean. There is a minibar in the room however it only had 2 bottles of water in it.
Cleanliness is great. The staff are very polite,very helpful and smiling.
The bedroom, although was great,  the decor is a little bit tired now as is the shower room. However I have to add, I do have a critical eye on detail so perhaps it's just me.
I think the breakfast selection can most definitely be improved.  There isn't the usual variety you'd expect from a hotel of this class or star rating.
Nice views of Canary Wharf from the deck at night.
Overall I'd be more than happy to stay here again.",4,2016,12,25
119,Wedding Anniversary in london,"The Sunborn ticked many boxes, great Location, spacious rooms with good facilities including all the complementories you could want and need, Staff were very welcoming and helpful from start to finish, however the only reason I'm not giving 5 out of 5 was due to the lack of continuity of service when dinning in the restaurant. At Dinner we were sat at a fabulous table with views of and magically lit dockland, and then left waiting and waiting and waiting to order pre dinner drinks and food 20 mins in total, in the end we skipped to just wine. I ended up stopping one of the young waiters and asking if we could order some drinks, a shame really as it wasn't due to lack of staff I think the opposite to many and not clear who was responsible for taking orders ! The same happened at breakfast only we got a chance to order tea as we were sat,but it never arrived, once again I had to stop staff and ask if we could get some tea ! service was let down by this small error but an important one, management need to take time to brief staff at the binging of any shift and delegate these responsibilities to ensure guests are looked after all the way through.
The food at dinner was tasty and we'll presented, breakfast had a great choice too, would we stay again.....
Probably, the rail links are brilliant and every where is a short train or tube ride away. The Sunborn definitely has the different factor than just a regular Hotel. Thankyou for a pleasant and memorable stay the truffles and Anniversary card in our room on arrival were a lovely touch 😄",4,2016,12,23
119,Amazing,"This was a 50th birthday celebration,  The staff were pleasant and friendly, very willing to help and courteous.  The décor was very plush and made me feel like I was royality. The room and shower room was very clean and the bed very comfortable, so relaxing that my partner did not even get up for breakfast "" I could have slept all day"" were his words.  I would not have believed I was still in East London.  I am already looking to book another weekend stay.  

Thank you to all the staff at The Sunborn Yacht Hotel London",5,2016,12,23
119,Mr,Had a fantastic couple of days aboard the Sunborn great Staff great food great accomadation. Will definately stay again.The cabin was spotless and spacious the staff very very helpful. The food was also spot on. All in all a realy great stay.,5,2016,12,20
119,Great for O2 and Excel.,"3 night stay; room was good, tho possibly a little tired (some staining on carpets for example). 

Hotel might be a little noisy for some, plane noise from city airport (I found this to be ok) and footsteps echoing in corridors; bathroom doors tend to slam shut a little hard too.

Had a Caeser salad in the bar which was massively overpriced and a bit limp. Room service was much better tho (chicken sandwich).

Transport links are ok, not as good as central London of course, Emirates airline cable car to O2 was fun and fairly cheap really.

Staff were nice.

I probably would not stay again, preferring somewhere closer to central London. It was a good fun alternative location tho.
",4,2016,12,20
119,Family birthday,"Visited with my wife, daughter and her partner for my daughters birthday treat, we arrived early and check in was painless and quick with staff ensuring we had a joining rooms.

Both cabins were spacious and very clean with good wi fi speed and excellent tv channels.

We spent the afternoon in the Sundown bar drinking cocktails with eats all excellent, good value but not cheap two cocktails plus a bottle of wine just over £50.

Unfortunately we could not get a reservation for the Lands End restaurant so went out and eat on the dock but returned after dinner to the Sundown which had great views of the  Emirates cable car and dock.

We took advantage of the weekend breakfast deal and for £12.50 had an excellent start to the day.

Taking full advantage we spent the morning exploring locally and took the cable car to Greenwich all in all a memorable and great visit!",5,2016,12,19
119,Xmas party,"Great Christmas party on Sunborn yacht hotel and fantastic stay over.  The food, drink and service was amazing.  The rooms are very luxurious & so spacious and we thoroughly recommend this hotel to everyone :-)",5,2016,12,18
119,Birthday weekend,"What can I say apart from amazing, the yacht is stunning and the rooms are spacious clean and beautiful. We were stunned by the beautiful chandelier in reception and the polished brass and glass everywhere. The Christmas decorations are lovey and most of the staff are polite and helpful.
On arrival we were advised that once we had got to our room to look at the menu for the evening as the restaurant was filling fast, 10 minutes later we tried to book and were told the resteraunt was already booked  for the evening, as you can understand we were very dissapointed and the rude young man that spoke to my husband was the only member of staff that let the place down. We were dissapointed as this was my husbands 65 birthday weekend treat which the hotel were aware of from my booking and at no time was this mentioned and we had to go and find somewhere to eat .On return we were advised we could have eaten at the resteraunt as there were tables empty!!!
We did eat there for Sunday lunch and it was absolutely amazing .
My advise is if staying  book the resteraunt before you arrive to avoid dissapointment and call to find out what the menu is as I e-mailed to ask if there was a festive menu and no one replied and the menu on the website is out dated.
Also if there is a function going on paying guests are made to drink  in a make shift bar upstairs which was not suitable at all.
The Sunborn is the most beautiful hotel and I will defiantly return but I would call first to ask a few questions before booking
Well done to the rest of the staff you were very polite and curious ",5,2016,12,18
119,A unique experience in London,"A fabulous place to stay. Really comfortable room overlooking the dock area. The neighbouring London City Airport couldn't really be heard through closed doors. Food in the restaurant was excellent and the spa treatment that my partner had was very good too. One or two small points stop it getting five stars in my opinion. Firstly I think that some kind of meet and greet could be provided at the edge of the road for those arriving by car. It's only 100 yards to walk to the yacht but then when on board to check in you have to return to the car to go and park your car. Valet parking please. Secondly, some ambient music in the lounge would be nice. Still a great experience. Thank you. ",4,2016,12,18
119,A Place to Treat Yourself,"We have stayed in many places but would like to say this was by far the best. Good room layout and felt we were in a bit of luxury, good location to surrounding area with the choice of going out and enjoying or locking yourselves up and enjoying each other.",5,2016,12,17
119,Christmas Part,"Amazing work Christmas party on the Sunborn, food was assume, staff / service was fantastic, and amazing views from the deck, had a great evening partied till late

The rooms are very spacious, great night sleep 

",5,2016,12,17
119,A pleasant one night stay,"Arrived mid afternoon but sadly my room wasn't ready so decided to eat a late bar lunch. The bar is pleasant but a little underwhelming given the nature of the hotel. Whilst the views are fabulous the decor was pretty much like any bricks and mortar hotel which surprised me. Anyway lunch was fine if not cheap.

My room (is it a cabin) was spacious and well looked after although a little on the warm side. Facilities were good. 

I guess the best part was the price although the nearby Excel was closed and the hotel is far from convenient for central London. The room rate was good given the size. 

So overall it was a good value stay, pleasant and clean room but rather lacked the wow I was expecting given it's a yacht. I've stayed in some far more exciting bricks and mortar rooms. Sadly I had to leave early so missed the breakfast experience! ",4,2016,12,16
119,Wedding anniversary stay,"We stayed on the Sunborn London,as we have done all the high end hotels in London and wanted something a bit different,it doesnt dissapoint,we had an executive river view overlooking the O2,i had booked the rose and swan package and had complimentary champagn vouchers with a hand written message from the management which was nice,it is easily reachable by the cable cars but they do stop at 9pm on a week day so it is dlr from Canning Town,we didnt eat on the Yacht but did try ordering breakfast through room service at 11am but were told breakfast finished at 10:30,we werent offered any alternative other than the restaurant opening at 12:30 for lunch!but other than that was a very pleasent stay in luxurious surroundings.",5,2016,12,16
119,Very good,"I get motion sickness, I cant go on cruises so this was perfect for me. I loved the experience and trying something new. My other half loved it too! it's amazing! When i arrived i got a room that was too close to the water level and it kinda made me feel unwell and they gladly moved me to a different room on a higher level which was kind of them",5,2016,12,15
119,Great,"Booked as a bit different ,i stay a lots of hotels but this is great with DLR and tube to central london and good value did not eat here so cannot comment on this but give it a go uou wont be disappointed ",5,2016,12,15
119,1 nights stay to visit o2,"Stayed there week comm 12th Dec 2016, not bad to park! Use the excel centre park as far to the right of the car park as you can, 5 mins walk.
Great looking place and grand entrance to reception, which is where the impression is tempered by the poor service. Not booked in, then found it, hear people arguing over thier Bill.....
Rooms are great though! Good balcony, strong wifi! Comfy bed, nice and  clean.
Opps! Go to bar, difficult to get eye contact and and soneone who can understand english, but ordered drinks ..... 15 mins later wrong drinks rock up....
Go to restaurant, not booked, but empty, manage to squeeze us in.....
10 mins menu, 10 mins order drinks, 10 mins get bread .... Patience thin!
Food was above average, but to fair not that expensive. 
Returned later for drink... 10 mins to order, 2 drinks wrong, not a happy face when asked for another bowl of nuts! (We already had one between 6 of us! Naughty)
Morning, nice view, good breakfast! Nice poached, all good ! Go to check out, not good, tried to charge me again fir my room that was booked and paid for in advance, same happened to our guests! Not impressed! Overall, bit quirky, nice rooms, crap service!",3,2016,12,14
119,SOS - Terrible Crew sunk our voyage before it began - and cost me £200 in the process!,"I don't like writing bad reviews, as I think it's too easy to complain or find fault. 

I also feel that it is more important to take time to offer words of praise, rather than scold or simply be critical. As such, I take the opportunity offered by this website to share great experiences and positive comments with the hope that others might try places that deserve more attention and more business and possibly try something they may not have thought of doing. 

I also realise that there are examples of poor service or a less than satisfactory experience that might be a one-off, or the result of someone having a bad day, or even just bad luck and Sod’s Law. So I'm willing to give a second chance and try again - and I'm often pleased to see how much better the second visit or encounter can be. 

However, when that does not occur on the 2nd, 3rd or 4th experience that is a sign of complete failure, and given the nature of the complete failure which I encountered with the Reservations staff at the Sunborn Hotel - and how one member of staff managed to turn an much anticipated adventure for me and my daughter into a completely disappointing and VERY EXPENSIVE failure, I am going to take the opportunity to share my very negative and disappointing experience with this hotel - with the hope that others may take heed and maybe the hotel might pay attention and wake up to the terrible impression they make. 

As if they don't, this boat might sink quickly! 

And with that introduction I begin the tale of dealing with a Reservations Agent who I call Absolutely Terrible. 

My 13 daughter and I love finding new and interesting adventures to experience in the city that we live in, and when I heard about the Sunborn Hotel, it looked like it would be a perfect choice. We both spent much time on the hotel's website picking out the treats we hoped to enjoy on board and even guessing where our room might be and what view we might enjoy. 

Little did we suspect that due to the complete indifference and total lack of courtesy or interest demonstrated by the hotel's Reservation Agent (who, for the sake of courtesy I will refer to by only their initials AT rather than give their full name) we never even got to set foot on the boat. 

After deciding to book a night on the boat I was quite thrilled to find that a night's stay at the Sunborn was available at a special rate through Groupon, which I purchased and then upgraded to an executive room and bought a breakfast and dinner package to ensure we had as special a visit as possible. 

I noted that the coupon needed to be used by a specific date and, as it turned out, unfortunately when I contacted the hotel to enquire about availability there was limited time before the coupon would expire, but certainly enough time that I expected to be able to book a room. 

Unfortunately the Absolutely Terrible reservations agent at the hotel did not assist, or even try. 

In total I had exchanged emails with Absolutely Terrible over a 4 day period during which the responses I received were uniformaly curt, terse, rude and unhelpful.  From an initial response of “we are fully booked and therefore do not have availability to redeem your voucher” it was clear to me that this reservations agent, and therefore the hotel, had not interest in being helpful or suggesting some way that I could get some value for the £200 I had already paid for the Groupon voucher.

The situation became more frustrating when a last minute cancelation was received by the hotel and I received an email from AT to “call immediately”.   In response I confirmed that I would take the room on that date, although it meant cancelling pre-arranged plans.   However, after confirming I could take the room and then contacting Absolutely Terrible again, I received a terse email advising; “We are fully booked on [that date]”.

No suggestion of an alternative.

No indication that they regretted the inconvenience.

No indication that they even cared.

As far as I could tell from these responses, from the Hotel’s perspective they had already received my money and couldn’t care less whether I got to use the voucher at all.  

It may be the case that the Sunborn Hotel regretted the fact that they had participated in the Groupon voucher offering.

It may also be the case that the Sunborn Hotel does not have to worry about clientele who might use such vouchers.   I assume that the likes of me are beneath them – or at least beneath the “elite” group that they wish to attract.

Or it may be the case that this hotel is just so successful that they don’t need to worry about frustrating and turning away potential business.   If so, I wish them luck – as they’re going to need it as that kind of attitude will not serve them well in the long run.

So in the end, my daughter and I never got to enjoy our much anticipated adventure and although I had spent £200 in advance, that did not let us put even a foot onto the deck of this hotel.

So unfortunately I can’t actually review the quality of the meals, the comfort of the beds, the water pressure for the showers – or even what it’s like to enter the Sunborn Hotel – as AT defeated my efforts to do so.

I recognise that this review has been long-winded and highly critical, which as noted at the outset is not my preference or my general practice.  And because of that I fear the reason for my lengthy comments may become lost in the telling of this tale.   

It was not the fact that in the end we could not stay at the hotel that was so very irksome.  I understand that hotels are fully booked from time to time and that means expectations and plans might need to be modified.   

What is not understandable or acceptable in my opinion if the attitude of the hotel – as represented by the reservation agent AT, which was so completely indifferent.   It clearly did not matter to this hotel whether or not they could help me or not, or whether or not I would be disappointed or troubled that I had spent a good sum of money for which I would receive not benefit, and that the hotel would receive without incurring any cost or output.   

The most important quality of any restaurant, hotel or attraction is service and attitude – as in many cases a lumpy mattress or a cold meal can be forgiven if it is clear that the people that you are dealing with are doing their very best even if the circumstances are not working in our favour.   

So it is for that reason that I have taken the time to share my unfortunate experience with this hotel.  In my case I don’t feel that they did their very best – or even try to do anything close to it.   From the start I was treated as an irritant and a bother – and that’s not a nice way to feel or appropriate.

So I would suggest that AT and the Sunborn Hotel really need to shape up or ship out.",1,2016,12,14
119,AMAZING,"Not only is this hotel on a stunning yacht but the staff made the experience. It is clear that all the staff get on and enjoy what they do. They are happy, friendly and cannot do enough for you. I cannot wait to go back just to see the staff again.

To everyone at the Sunborn...Thank you so much for making my stay an experience I will never forget.",5,2016,12,14
119,Perfect,"Booked package, which included one night stay and breakfast,  facial and afternoon tea with a glass of fizz, through Secret Escapes.
Executive room on floor 5 was lovely and clean and spacious with bathrobes and slippers and Molton brown toiletries. Complimentary tea, various types, and coffee and water. Bed extremely comfortable and very quiet. 
Facial was 30 minutes and very relaxing.
Afternoon tea was very enjoyable, sandwiches, cakes and scones were nice and fresh and served with tea and a glass of champagne. 
Bar prices were about par for the course for location and venue. Gin and tonic £11 and ameretto  £7.50.
Breakfast was delicious : full cooked, cold meats, cereal, fresh fruit, selection of breads. Juices and hot beverages.
Service throughout our stay was excellent and friendly. All areas of hotel were very, very  clean and polished.
I would recommend a stay on board.
Our package was value for money in our opinion.

119,BBC Music Awards,"Just a short review great for the excel and 5 star for the accommodation but 2 star for service. After the awards 40 mins to get a drink, after talking with reception who seemed little concern  when checking out ask if enjoyed stay answer no. Cost £ 270.00 for one night NO APPOLOGY from anyone.",2,2016,12,13
119,fab for a special occasion,"we stayed for one night with another couple.First impressions are really good as its such a novel place to stay and check in was fast.I thought seeing as we`d made the booking for all of us at the same time quite some time ahead we would have been on the same floor but we werent.Rooms were really spacious but as a top hotel we were surprised at some of the stains on the carpet.The bed was really comfy but we couldnt get the air con any cooler so hardly slept as we were too hot all night. We had some snacks in the bar which were good value for the size of it and ate dinner around the hotel in a resturant not to far & also popped in the pub just five minutes away.Went back to the bar for a irish coffee night cap and were shocked that 4 drinks came to £50 !. All in all its a fab place to stay for a special occasion ,just dont drink on the boat.",4,2016,12,12
119,Celebrating sons birthday ,Excellent place to stay. Especially if you are looking for something special and memorable. The Sunbourne is exquisite and deserves a five star rating. The reception is amazing and the staff friendly and helpful. I will definitely be coming back here. The room was spacious and we had a balcony overlooking the Excel centre.,5,2016,12,12
119,Birthday stay ,"Beautiful hotel, lovely comfy beds, quiet with nice surroundings and loads of local cafes and restaurants. Only thing that upset us was we were told we could go to their restaurant which we were looking forward to. So we got ready and choose what we wanted to eat, and headed up and we told it was fully booked although it was empty. This struck us as odd as we booked and executive room and were not informed booking was necessary. Also, the drink prices were expensive, though my cocktail was lovely. 
",4,2016,12,12
119,LOVELY.,"The Sunborn London is lovely, we only stayed for 2 nights but had a lovely time. The room was great and spotlessly clean, the bed was so comfortable too. The only small thing was the check in time is 1500pm and our room was not ready until 1530pm, they did apologise but we were in a hurry to get showered and changed as we had a taxi booked so that was a rush.  When we checked out we asked for 2 latte's before we started our journey home, we waited 10 minutes and then were given 2 black coffees, we explained we did not ask for that and we wanted latte's, we waited another 15 minutes and nothing arrived, we gave up and left.",4,2016,12,12
119,Amazing,"We stayed here on a Friday night as part of my wife's birthday treat and boy we weren't disappointed. This is an amazing place to stay, from the moment you walk up it looks so impressive and when you walk out the lift into reception it just gets better. As you should expect this is fitted out to a very high standard and everything about this oozes a little bit of class. we loved it. We had the 'under the sea' afternoon tea which was superb during the day before venturing out into town for a meal and a show. When we got back we enjoyed a drink in the very impressive bar but we were disappointed by the service a little which was slow to say the least. We were also given some complimentary nibbles and found a bit of plastic presumably from the box or whatever they were kept in. We were equally as disappointed that despite telling staff, not one senior member of staff came over to speak to us or anything like that. This is a five start hotel done out superbly a little bit of customer care and concern wouldn't go a miss in situations like this. We would go back despite this as we love the hotel, we got a deal on groupon and would recommend this as its very good value for money compared to the 'normal' rate.",5,2016,12,12
119,The perfect accomodation for LYC travelers,"I usualy come to and leave London for short trips through the City airport. The airport is around 20 min away from sunborn door to door. Used to stay in hotels inside of London which means tiny rooms for crazy money. Sunborn is the opsite in both aspects plus a lot of extra details. The place definetly exceeded my expecatations. If you tend to get seasick: no worries, this ship sits in very calm waters and does not move.",5,2016,12,11
119,Night on a ship ,"For 120 pounds which I paid no complaints at all the room was larger than most hotels rooms and if you are visiting the excel centre for an exhibition the place to stay but if you attending the 02 , it's a bit of a trek ",4,2016,12,10
119,"Novelty hotel, well worth the stay","Stayed here as an early birthday treat with my wife and our friends, and very glad we did. Had a lovely and unique stay here , it's a great concept, a yacht hotel. The room (river facing with balcony) was for a London hotel at that price spacious and comfortable. The carpets were plush but did have some stains, everything else was spotlessly clean and very pleasing to the eye. The room has both a kettle and capsule operated coffee machine, a choice of teas and hot chocolate. I enjoyed sipping on a coffee whilst watching life from the balcony. Breakfast was of a good quality but wasn't warm enough if I'm honest, a good choice nonetheless. Reception were very friendly and professional and offered to look after our bags after checkout, always a nice touch in London.",4,2016,12,10
119,Goodbye,"Lovely stay with girlfriends, rooms are very big, very clean, Staff were fantastic. Breakfast was very good, Close to docklands railway so very easy to get into town we went to Greenwich by cable car, 2 mins walk from the Sunborn .would love to stay again.",5,2016,12,09
119,Epic fail,What a massive let down.  Although we arrived before check in time we were hoping to be allowed an early check in as we had been travelling for over 24 hours. We were tired and in desperate need of a shower.  We were made to wait 4 hours for our room.  The view that greeted us was disgusting.  The pics show the filth and rubbish in the river.  So disappointed and will not be back.,1,2016,12,09
119,A steady ship,"A lovely place to stay. First class accomodation in lovely large cabins. The Sunborn is moored next to Excel, out in Victoria Dock. Transport into London City is easy using the DLR, a 2 minute walk away. The O2 arena is an easy 'flight' away on the Emirates flight which is an attraction in its own right, with superb views across London. 
There are an abundance of restaurants locally and in the O2 arena, it's easy to walk to them and as we were there when there weren't any exhibitions on it was nice and quiet. 
In regards to the Yacht - I really enjoyed staying on board. The cabin was spacious, with a comfortable king sized bed. There was a coffee maker and kettle, a fridge, large sitting area and it was quiet. The bathroom is adequate in size with a shower not bath. The toiletries were Moulton Brown, which I particularly like.  We were invited to the VIP reception on our first evening and enjoyed several glasses of prosecco! We also dined on the boat one evening in the attractive dining room. The staff were attentive and pleasant, there was fairly small selection of wine but of a good standard, however,  I can only say the food was reasonable - tasty -  but the menu was not remarkable. Glad we did eat on board though because it was a totally pleasurable experience. The breakfasts are ok but not amazing, there is plenty to eat but the hot offering wasn't very hot. 
I would definitely recommend the Sunborn for that slightly different experience in London!",5,2016,12,07
119,Disappointing,"After having wanted to stay here for a while, finally did as part of a theatre trip to London, shame it turned out to be so disappointing as it was a birthday treat. Our room was not ready when we arrived, then we discovered that not only were we on the lower level 1, but that the view from our room was not over the Thames but of a concrete wall. Did complain to reception, but were told they were fully booked, everyone else in our group had rooms overlooking the river on upper floors. The room was ok, but not luxurious as expected. Breakfast was an absolute shambles, had to queue for over 15 minutes, staff all wandering around with no clue on how to wait or clear tables, waited nearly 20 minutes for a simple pot of tea, had to repeatedly ask for cups and cutlery. Rooms need refurbishing and staff need some decent training",2,2016,12,07
119,Highly Recommend!,"We stayed at the Sunborn during the winter, my dad had booked it as a surprise, as we arrived we were so shocked as I had never heard of it. As we walked up it was beautiful, the reception staff were lovely. We had to pay for the breakfast but it was reasonably priced for London. We enjoyed our stay very much and have booked to stay again in February! 😀",5,2016,12,07
119,It was extremely excellent experience staying in Sunborn Yacht London.,"I enjoyed staying at Sunborn Yacht in London as the staff, room and the services were excellent but the only the thing disappointed me was asking for a deposit of 200£ in spite of the fact That i paid 4 nights. I suggest that the management should not ask for this deposit. I would recommend them to friends and stay again. Thanks",5,2016,12,06
119,Great Place,"We stayed here for 2 nights as a family of 4 (children aged 15 & 11) for an event at O2. Loved the room, had a mini balcony which we weren't expecting, very comfortable beds, robes and slippers which the kids loved! Molton Brown products and a Lavazza coffee machine in the room.  Staff were superb! Incredibly friendly and helpful right from check in, through room service and bar service. Unique experience. Took the Emirates cable car over to the O2 at dusk which was fab. 
",5,2016,12,06
119,"Decadent stay, well worth it ",I stayed here as I went to a gig at the O2 and didn't fancy a long journey home afterwards.  The yacht is luxurious and a short walk from Custom House DLR and the cable car to North Greenwich.  I loved the wooden panelling and the bathroom was spotless.  While I was there I had an enjoyable lunch and a relaxing treatment in the spa.  My room (cabin?) had a view and balcony looking over the water to the other side of the dock. It was very peaceful and I slept well.  Breakfast was a buffet so there was plenty of it.  I would love to stay here again.,5,2016,12,05
119,Novel but expensive,"The Sunborn Yacht looks impressive on approach and check in was efficient although rooms aren't available till 3pm. Rooms are spacious and clean and the bed was very comfortable although the pillows were not so. A single bed had been set up in our room which was not required and took up the seating area, we couldn't find the coffee machine either but neither concierge, reception or housekeeping were answering phones. After visiting reception someone did come to remove the bed and showed us the coffee machine, hidden behind the TV. We ate in the restaurant and food was nice but, for meat eaters,  choice was limited to either a turkey dish or a chicken dish. The rest was either fish or vegetarian.  The bill was £260 for 4 including 2 bottles of wine. A round of drinks was an additional £50 and they put service charge on everything. breakfast is not included although they do a good value early deal for £7.50 each. The room was £230 for one night and personally think it's a bit expensive even for the novelty value of staying on a yacht.  The staff were helpful and friendly and we enjoyed exploring the area. It's really handy for O2 and the Emirates cable car and Greenwich. They are lots of bars and restaurants in the area so you could eat out to keep costs down.",3,2016,12,05
119,Sunborn London,"Had a lovely stay on the yacht; this was our second visit.
Good location, great accommodation and friendly helpful staff.
Very comfy bed, and facilities.
Only down side was a noisy disruptive child in dining area.",5,2016,12,04
119,"Old time glamour, average food and staff service","We were really looking forward to staying on the sunborn. When onboard you will not be disappointed with its old time decorative charms. The lobby has a stunning chandelier and beautiful wood effect panelling. 

However, our check in was average, no details on times of services in the restaurants and bar with little information passed across about facilities in the hotel. 

We had afternoon tea booked, and whilst the view was amazing on a glorious sunny day, the sandwiches were really dry and curly at the sides, you could tell that they had been sitting around for some time in a fridge before being served. 

The restaurant staff were not very attentive, bar staff were better. 

I would, recommend staying for the experience but do not have high hopes on food and service. ",3,2016,12,03
119,Excellent Start to the Festive Period,"A group of eight friends chose to dine in the Sunborn restaurant for a festive Sunday lunch last week.
The atmosphere, cuisine and service were first rate.
There was a little confusion regarding the rate of pricing structure but our waiter - LASZIO dealt with the matter swiftly and professionally and the outcome was accepted by all concerned - needles to say, the company homoured our original booking conditions.
All of the staff were friendly and professional, with LASZIO, exceptionally so - thank you.
We will certainly repeat the experience.",5,2016,12,02
119,Let down,"I stayed for an event taking place at the ExCeL and thought that the Sunborn was my best bet given its proximity to the venue. I felt really let down and certainly wouldn't go back.

The room was good so no complaints there, it's is really the room service that annoyed me. The menu is very small meaning that I had pizza all three nights of my stay. The pizza on the first night was poor but improved on nights two and three.  Each evening I asked for a bottle of water but the size varied each night from a large bottle to a very small bottle, the price however was always the same.

My biggest complaint however was that I ordered breakfast to the room at 8am on my final morning but it didn't arrive until 8:30. When it finally did arrive instead of the full English i selected I got a bowl of muesli. I didn't even have time to have the incorrect order as I had to leave for work. Really annoying to leave with no food before a long day on my feet at the event.

The boat itself is nice and the staff friendly but I'll be staying elsewhere next time.",2,2016,12,01
119,Good Hotel but don't waste your money on the breakfast!,"Rooms are comfortable and surprisingly spacious. A nice experience being on the water with a great view from the porthole.  However, a very expensive £39 for breakfast for two and it was all stone cold (not exaggerating). We were also not offered tea or coffee by the waitress! I emailed Sunborn this feedback and have received no response. Very poor customer care, happy to take your money though!",2,2016,11,29
119,Luxury,This on one of the best and most luxurious hotels we have stayed in for a long time. When you enter reception it is like walking into cruise ships we have been on. Entering your magnificently enormous room brings gasps of delight. All staff are friendly and efficient and we wished we could have stayed longer to enjoy our experience,5,2016,11,29
119,Gimmicky and average ,"This hotel is basically a docked yacht that has been converted into a hotel. As far as accommodation goes, whilst it's certainly different it's just not up to scratch v a 4 star hotel equivalent.  Very small bathrooms, worn and dirty carpets, very old decor and chintzy.

Ordered room service pizza and it was the worst pizza I've ever had. Room service menu also very limited. 

Not enough UK plug sockets- there's EU plug sockets as well.

Overall this hotel is nothing more than a gimmick. Save your money and book in at the Novotel.

",3,2016,11,29
119,Decent afternoon tea - left us stuffed,"We decided to have a spot of afternoon tea, something different and this was certainly the case.

We went for the underwater classic afternoon tea and their was a good selection of food, teas etc. We were lucky enough to get a window seat overlooking O2 / Canary Wharf which was nice.

I love Molton Brown so to see they had it in the bathrooms were very classy.

We had a great afternoon so thats all that maters. Thank you",4,2016,11,28
119,Terrible ,"Worst afternoon tea we have ever had, got 1 round of sandwiches for 3 people so not even two slices of bread each, bread was rock hard as was the scones. The cakes were from a cheap shop with no taste. Not one thing was freshly baked. Very disappointed for £26 per person. Also only got 1 tea bag per person this should be stated on the website before people book. All three of us left hungry and definitely won't be going back. ",1,2016,11,27
119,Excellent,"Stayed overnight for my birthday, absolutely faultless. Rooms are spotless, service was impeccable. Chocolates left in the room on my birthday, the staff are very friendly and can't do enough for you. Can't wait to stay again. Use the cable cars, fantastic experience.",5,2016,11,27
119,Unique hotel ,"Surprised my Husband with an overnight stay on this fantastic yacht hotel!
We got the dlr to excel customs house and it was about a 5 minute walk away. Passing the excel arena on our left, the Sunborn can be seen to the right.

We stayed in a family room and it was very spacious! The sofa bed was set up already for our little one. 

The bathroom wasn't the most modern bit it was clean and had a shower and Molten Brown products.

The bed was comfy, there's tea making facilities and also a mini fridge with complimentary bottle water. 

The bar allowed you to go outside to the deck and had a great view of Canary Wharf  and planes that flew over to London City airport. The planes did not interrupt your sleep at all.

After being out for most of the day, when we came back into the room they had left some biscuits and macaroons with a letter for my husband to wish him a happy 50th birthday even though it was booked for his 40th! But still, it was a nice touch. 

It isn't the most central for London, it really does depend what you're after. We have done it now and glad to say we did. ",5,2016,11,26
119,Stunning,This floating hotel is stunning. The staff are so polite and very helpful. This ship is absolutely stunning we will stay again. It is in an ideal location for the O2 and if you want to slip into London it has every means of transport to hand. Thank you for a memorable stay,5,2016,11,26
119,Lovely,"It's a lovely hotel. The room was great - lots of space and spotless. The only niggle we had was the lack of information with regard to parking. We drove up for a number of reasons and it was dark when we arrived. It was a complete mystery tour as there are no signs for the hotel or information as to the best places to park, how far etc. When we mentioned it on checking in the Receptionist looked at us in silence for a few seconds then carried on checking us in. The spa description is a little tenuous. Yes you can book treatments but that's not what I would call a spa hotel. Didn't worry me as that's not why we chose it but some may. Bit disappointed the terrace bar was closed. Drinks with the view would be nice. I can't see why it couldn't be open to sit even if you have to go to the main bar to buy drinks. A bit more easily accessible local information on the tablets would be helpful but overall a lovely hotel",4,2016,11,26
119,Birthday surprise,"Our trip was a surprise for my husbands birthday, he loved it when we arrived and he saw where we were staying. We stayed for 1 night, wish it was more. The yacht is lovely inside and out. Our room was a good size with a balcony, very clean and comfortable. The staff were excellent, they were welcoming and helpful. The dinner and breakfast was delicious. The views from the deck of the yacht was amazing, especially at night when it was all lit up. We loved the area as it has easy access via the DLR to the centre of London. The cable cars are also close by. Will definitely be returning for another stay",5,2016,11,24
119,Family night away,"Came here for my mother in law's birthday. We were looking forward to the stay for a long time before coming. From seeing the yacht it is very impressive! The lobby area and bar are beautiful and the rooms are also. One of the rooms wasn't ready an hour after check in, but complimentary drinks were offered to apologise. Got to the room and they were beautiful, clean and impressive. Bed was very soft which I like but my other half struggled with! Coffee machine needed cleaning as was spouting out dirty water but a housekeeper was more than happy to come and repair this. Only complaint was room was very warm- even after turning down the air con, but when it is so cold outside we shouldn't moan too much! Reception staff very apologetic when we mentioned this. Breakfast was delicious and lots of choice. Would definitely return! ",4,2016,11,23
119,sheer luxury,"stayed for 2 nights, wish it was longer, beautiful boat, lovely staff, very welcoming,close to the DLR and the cable cars for the 02 arena.had a meal in the restaurant which was very nice, sat by the window looking out towards canary wharf.",5,2016,11,23
119,Not really nice,"We spent one night and it wasn't what we expect. On the ariving nobody told us informations about breackfast or room service or dining or some information.In the room we didn't had menu for room service. 
We had coffee machine but all the things that we need it for coffee ware hidden in the draw. 
The worst thing that can happen to someone in a Monday morning is the fire alarm. Nobody inform us that they have it at 10 o'clock. Which is before check out and totally unwelcome.",2,2016,11,22
119,What an Amazing Hotel!!  Just WOW,"The whole experience here was amazing.  My Husband and I work away a lot so stay in many different hotels. We don't get to spend a great deal of time together and this was a special weekend away for us.  This hotel exceeded both our expectations.  The actual hotel itself was incredible - I didn't expect it to feel like we were staying on a yacht once inside but you total do - they have completely kept the integrity of they yacht itself.  The staff were amazing - friendly, helpful and do everything to make sure your stay is good.  The food in the restaurant was fabulous.  I love this place in fact so much that we have booked to stay again at Christmas!!",5,2016,11,22
119,Not recommended,"In theory sounded like a good idea. I was picking a hotel with a spa from the suggestions list here on trip adviser. It was one of the top ones. However to a massive disappointment it was incorrectly advertised. There is no spa. I don't consider a massage room with massage therapist that you have to book in advance a spa. You can get such a better hotel for the same price with a good quality spa. Like Dorsett or K West, that both have therapy rooms and spa available with hydro pool, steam, sauna etc. The only thing is the view of the river and Canary Wharf, that u can get sitting around in a pub in docklands for far less than room cost plus £5 beers in bar area. We were also charged £40 deposit for mini bar as described by the desk person. Mini bar was empty, except for 2 bottles of water. Room was ok, coffee table was covered in dust, sink had some weird stains on it, water pressure in the shower was bad, water didn't get hot enough. Not recommended at all. It looks good from outside and sounds good in theory, not when u actually stay there.",1,2016,11,22
119,Great Experience,"- About Hotel
Rooms are large. We stayed @ 2nd deck, with a view to the river. Had breakfast only and the food was tasty. Very nice atmosphere with friendly staff. Quiet room but from time to time you might hear airplanes taking-off or landing on the nearby airport (but it happend only twice in three days..)
The bed is fantastic. We slept like babies. 
TV is Freeview only so do not expect anything else to see on TV.
Inside it does not feel as you would be on a sail yacht. You do not feel that the hotel is on water. The room has fixed portlight so if you want fresh air, turn on the AC. 
- Arround the Hotel: 
There are a few close restaurants, indian, chinese, spanish (if you preffer to eat out and still be cose), Starbucks, NISA and Tesco Express (if you need something quick for snack or water). Close to DLR station ""Custom House"". You can get via DLR/Jubilee at Waterloo Station in just 20 minutes. 
- Prices:
Although the room was expensive.. well.. it's a yacht! I believe it is an experience which worths the money. We booked via hotel.com, but you can book on their website too.
-Overall:
Left with a very good impression.",5,2016,11,22
119,Very nice Birthday Treat,"My wife and I , sister in law and husband had a one night stay with evening mea plus breakfast l on the Sunborn . Front office staff very helpful , cabin accommodation excellent with lovely river views . The evening meal was ok nothing special , waiting staff not really at the standard you would expect at a high end location like the Sunborn Hotel . Wine prices not too bad but the bar prices very expensive , rum & coke and a gin & tonic £27!! self service breakfast very nice and overall had a lovely time .",4,2016,11,22
119,Nice Experience and good service ,Stayed in this hotel for the food trade show. The yacht hotel is next to the exhibition center so that's very convenient. At arrival my name was not in the system because of a booking under an other name true booking. After 10 min they found it and apologized for the inconvenience. No problem they where very polite. The room super and the bed fantastic slept very good. Only negative point is the airplanes flying over during the day. Dinner in the restaurant was good and you have a perfect view. Super place to stay!!,5,2016,11,22
119,Amazing,"My boyfriend and I stayed here as it was my 21st birthday. It was a complete surprise to me and when we were arrived I was taken away. Walking in to the Lobby was absolutely amazing, views out on to the docks was something else. Staff were absolutely lovely. We stayed in the executive suite which was just incredibly spacious - could not fault the room. We also had an inclusive breakfast the following morning which was amazing. I am a vegetarian and their were plenty of options for me (no quorn alternatives which was the only disappointment but I do understand that this is not always possible). For those interested, the buffet breakfast had everything imaginable from the classic english breakfast to bagels with salmon and cream cheese. Attentive staff and beautifully decorated hotel. 

I can not wait to come back here in the future.",5,2016,11,21
119,Met our expectations and more,"I booked The Sunborn for my partner's 60th birthday.  I upgraded our room to Executive River view.  The room was large and well appointed with everything that you could possibly need.  It was super clean, had nice furnishings and was very comfortable.  Monica had arranged some chocolates as a birthday surprise when we got to our room with a lovely letter which was a nice touch.  Dinner was very good and the food was superb.  Our wait person, Lency was very good and  very friendly and welcoming.  A small cake with candle was brought out at the end of our meal, which again was lovely.  It definitely has a WOW factor and I would highly recommend, especially if you have a special occasion.  All the staff were lovely and helpful and we will return.",5,2016,11,21
119,WOW! ,"I took my partner here for his birthday as a surprise & from the minute we stepped foot on the yacht we were treated to a fantastic experience, we arrived just before 2pm & had lunch in the lands end restaurant whilst waiting for our room (check in is 3pm) the food & service in the restaurant was 5* we couldn't have asked to be treated better. On checking into our room we were asked if we'd like help with our luggage which we declined. Upon arriving in our room we were gain surprised with the level of service, I had informed the hotel it was my partners birthday when booking & when we entered our room they had decorated it with balloons & banners & left us a birthday cake & truffles to enjoy. Our room was spotlessly clean & had everything & more we could want while we stayed there.  We left the hotel for the evening but they got us a car within 5 minutes, & wished us an enjoyable evening. The following morning we went for breakfast (hot & continental buffet) again the service & food was 5* & we had a very enjoyable breakfast experience. When checking out we were asked if we required any help with our luggage or if we needed a car service. 
I didn't read any reviews for this hotel & restaurant before we arrived but after having read them I felt I needed to review our experience as we were treated to the most warm, welcoming & wonderful experience from the moment we set foot on the yacht. I couldn't have wished for a better experience for my partners birthday & we will most definitely be returning to the venue!",5,2016,11,21
119,wow,This hotel certainly has the wow factor.From the moment you walk into the reception area you can see the place ousese class.We upgraded to the river side view which is worth the bit extra .The room is clean and  comfortable and we enjoyed the complementary wine over looking the river.The breakfast was great with all the staff being attentive.Although a bit pricey  Would we return.... Yes like a shot thank you for a great time ,5,2016,11,21
119,Daughters birthday treat,"We booked this hotel as a birthday gift for our daughter after she had seen it earlier this year and had been wowed! We were not disappointed in anyway. The boat was delightful in so many ways, from decor, facilities, view and presentation, through to staff and food. We will not hesitate to book again and will look forward to other opportunities. 
The complimentary drinks on arrival to make up for our few minutes of waiting for our room made it even more superb 😀👍",5,2016,11,20
119,Pleasant stay,We arrived and we're delighted with the look of reception. One room was ready the other not until 40 minutes after check in time. Reception was very very slow. The food is superb and staff pleasant. Breakfast was good apart from the coffee which is awful. We had to ask three times for coffee as we had been forgotten about! When it came I wish I had ordered tea.... we would stay again but go out for breakfast. We would eat in the restaurant again in the evening. Lovely spacious rooms with good lavazza coffee machine (I know the irony of it!) great location. ,4,2016,11,20
119,"Ibis across the road is better! Staff are useless, spent more time at the front desk than in my room. ","The best thing to do is go visit the reception area of this hotel and stay at the Ibis hotel across the road. You'll probably be treated as an actual guest over there. 

Save your money and spend it elsewhere.  Paying such a price you'd expect to be treated with a little respect. 

Massive let down. 

This was supposed to be a relaxing break.  After hearing good things about this hotel. We decided to stay, everything was supposed to prebooked. It was nothing but a shambles. 

Upon check in, nothing was confirmed. We had to ask about the bottle of wine in the room. We also had dinner booked in the restaurant the next day with a deposit upfront of £100 for dinner in the evening, no mention of that. Again had to ask at the front desk. Both the front desk and restaurant did not know what was going on. The staff were just running around like headless chickens. 

After all the trouble and standing at the front desk constantly asking for something or another that this hotel has forgotten or missed. We decided to take a different approach and tried using the phone in the room. We tried to double check our reservations instead of constantly going to the front desk only to find no one answering at all.  

I tried the following:

Restaurant (called 6 times - had some annoying answering machine) 

Front desk (no answer - called 7 times) 

I rang every option on the phone. No answer, yet there are staff constantly running around the hotel. 

The lands end restaurant was a complete waste of time, they missed a delivery, which was embarrassing to say the least. 

Only 2 starters available. (what's the point of going to a restaurant, where you are restricted just to eat a main?) absolutely no mention of this, despite making the reservation 3 weeks before and again on our arrival, again on the day of our arrival and again the day we were supposed to eat in the restaurant. 

The reason why the menu was poor was because a delivery had been missed! What a let down.

119,Pleasant but not amazing as expected ,"Lovely yacht, very secure as a key card is needed to access floors. Room was nice, although the carpet had lots of brown/black stains around the sofa area. There was only water in the minibar, which was disappointing. There was no room service menu or any kind of information on the hotel in the room and the website is also limited. Tried to order room service but they never answer the phone!! 
Rooms were quiet and comfortable. ",4,2016,11,20
119,Unforgettable Night,"Booked in for one night for my girlfriends birthday expecting it to be a really nice stay. But I was blown away by how amazing the experience was. 

The executive room was divine. Loads of space to relax, bath robes to walk around in all night, and a beautifully comfortable king-size bed.

The staff were all lovely, making us feel very welcome, and they even let us take home the free bottle of wine that was meant to come with our room but we'd forgotten to ask for!

Breakfast was a lovely buffet, featuring a huge range of items from a classic full English, to bagels and smoked salmon.

All of this on a bloody boat!!

Overall a fantastic night in a fantastic place, would definitely recommend to everybody and will 100% be going again!

119,Excellent location for visiting the Excel,"I booked the Sunborn for it's location next to the Excel for a conference. For this reason it was excellent with a 100 metre walk, meaning a lie in and a leisurely breakfast. 
Check in was efficient and the room I had looking out over the water was very good. It was spacious and clean and well appointed. 
Breakfast was good but a bit over priced at £19.50 each.
Staff were helpful and efficient.
I wouldn't stay here if I was going to a show, as the tube ride in is quite long with 2 changes but for the Excel or O2 it's perfect.",5,2016,11,20
119,Superb staff and excellent boat,"My steps into the hotel were tired because booking.com has failed to book me a room in London, not informed me - and noticed that late in the evening when asking the situation in the hotel in which according to the reservation code I should have stayed. Sunborn staff listened to me, realised my situation and organised to me a room with suitable rate, even offered coffee and cakes. And I did also get the best possible breakfast. What a relief to face kind and understanding people, who are ready to put the effort and find the last possible room to stay overnight, eveen it takes some tasks to do.",5,2016,11,18
119,Very poor afternoon tea,"I visited here after my friends daughter who is from out of London chose this for an afternoon tea present.I have to say I was very excited after viewing the place,but sadly it did not live up to expectations! 

The quality of the actual food was truly appalling..Questionable fish option sandwiches, extremely poor quality cakes left me literally wanting to vomit ! The staff were all friendly but not attentive at all and I struggled to get more tea out of them..

I didn't complain at the time as my friends daughter had booked it for her 50th and they are firstly not the type to complain ( unlike me ) plus I didn't want to ruin the day for them...

Not good value for money or a nice afternoon out at all..Book with caution as the price they charge is a rip off for poor quality..",2,2016,11,17
119,WOW! Amazing!,"This hotel was just fabulous!! Had an Executive room with a balcony overlooking the river. It was just before bonfire night so could see fireworks going off over the other side of the river. Very romantic! We didn't eat on board so can't comment about the food. Drinks a little expensive - Cocktails around £11 and a bottle of wine around £28. Room was very well equipped, huge comfy bed, flat screen TV, fridge, tea/coffee maker, and there is a tablet provided free of charge. We stayed because my boyfriend was at an exhibition in Billingsgate.  We got an excellent deal from Hotels.com £348 for two nights, so very good value indeed when you look at the average nightly rate. Can't wait to go back.",5,2016,11,16
119,Great value and good location for O2,"Stayed 2 nights in a family suite with river view balcony. Lovely place to stay if you want something different and quirky. Easy ride over the river on the emirates cable car to the O2. Comfortable rooms, staff attentive and anticipate needs (we got offered extra towels and shampoo/conditioner without having to ask.) we didn't eat on board since the prices seemed rather expensive even by London standards, but maybe the price tag means the food is worth it.",5,2016,11,16
119,Disappointed,Came here for 2 nights the yacht is stunning and well maintain but that were its ends. Its too far away from city and westend having to get 2 or 3 tubes to there and a taxi back to the yacht is £35 pounds.drinks on the yacht was very expenisive so we drank esle where. Not alot to do around this area. For the money we paid I would rather have booked into travellodge in covent garden and use the remaining money for a slap up meal.,4,2016,11,15
119,Very comfortable!,We stayed here for a few days whilst in London and although it is located a long way out of the centre of London that meant it was quiet and a real place of solitude.  The room was extremely comfortable and the staff were polite and helpful.  We enjoyed some lovely cocktails at the bar.  To be honest the distance to travel into the centre of the city would mean we would probably stay more central next time but this is definitely the best choice if you are looking for a location near the O2 or Excel Centre and the hotel itself cannot be faulted!,5,2016,11,15
119,Amazing,"A beautiful place location wise 
Looks beautiful from outside 
Lovely atmosphere and just as truly amazing inside 
Room is amazing
View is beautiful 
Need to be checked out to believe
Feels like a yattcj holiday :))",4,2016,11,15
119,Absolutely amazing!!,"My Partner and I stayed at the Sunborn on a Saturday evening in Nov as a birthday treat and we couldn't have been happier! The staff were so lovely and you genuinely felt as if nothing was too difficult for them, you felt very special and made a fuss of. We loved it and can't wait to return! ",5,2016,11,14
119,Glamoursly different hotel stay.................,"Measuring 394ft long approaching the yacht is quite impressive.

Queue upon check in.  Reception staff efficient though.

You would be advised to book rooms facing out onto the water. Portside rooms come with considerably less inspiring views of the ExCel centre.

The bar, restaurant and top deck Sky Bar (all open to non-staying guests) are in the stern of the ship, and gaze towards the city & o2 with the steel grey cranes lining the dock either side of the water.

We paid £260 for what was called an executive family room, queen bed, convertible sofa (not comfortable) & a small balcony. 

We took afternoon drinks in the Sundown Bar.  You are encouraged to take a seat & then have your order taken at the table & be served. There is however an added 12.5% service charge added for this so beware & the service was slow too.  I had to ask to be served in the end & indeed each time we wanted a drink we had to get someone's attention. £40 for a bottle of Prosecco, really, come on I know we are in London but still, they did not have to go to Italy to get it for me.

Breakfast was an extra £25 for the 3 of us (children free I think).  Had to wait for a table to be laid. Buffet style help yourself hot & cold selection, very nice & tasty. Had to ask for plates for the food though & glasses for the juice. Also had to ask for butter for the bread which came out rock hard straight from the fridge so tore the bread apart upon spreading. Good sized tea & coffee pots providing 3/4 cups from each I would say.

Worth staying if nothing else but for the alternative 'super yacht' style accommodation.

You cannot drive up to the hotel entrance, there is 24hr parking nearby (5mins walk) in a car park opposite the Novotel @ £15 flat rate cost for 24hrs.

No swimming pool although there is a Spa on board apparently, we did not visit this.",4,2016,11,14
119,"£27.00 for drinks, I want a drink not a share in the place","This is a floating hotel berthed in the Royal Victoria Docks. As you approach the yacht you can start to appreciate its size. There is a lift dockside to let you gain access into the foyer. You are greeted by a mass of polished brass both on the walls and the ceiling and a highly polished stone floor. It gives the appearance of sheer opulence. This is reflected in the bar prices. They are to say the least exorbitant. You certainly wouldn’t want to stay and quench your thirst as you would be bankrupt. A small bottle of beer cost £5.00, for £3.00 more you could get a dozen box of the same beer from the supermarket a few hundred yards away. A bottle of fruit cider was £6.00 and the wine per glass was £8.00 so for 4 drinks the bill was £27.00. I don’t mind paying for the privilege of salubrious setting but I didn’t want a stake in the place. We have been in fancier setting and paid a lot less for similar drinks so I don’t know how they warrant their costs. All in all it is worth a visit but bear in mind it could cost you a lot if you stay for a drink.",3,2016,11,13
119,Fantastic & Different,"Really unusual to find this style of hotel, with very large comfortable room. Great breakfast with spectacular views.
Highly recommended. The location could be an issue for some travellers however the DLR is close, no on site car park the only downside.
",5,2016,11,13
119,Simply Beautiful,"From the moment you approach the Sunborn yacht hotel you cannot help but take a second look.
she (the yacht) is stunning and would not be out of place if she were anchored in the south of France or in Monaco.
On entering the hotel through the port side you immediately step into a well it lift which takes you up to the reception deck.
The staff on-board manning the reception were fantastic, polite courteous and answered every question I asked. We were immediately offered a room (Cabin) upgrade from a quay side cabin to a canal side cabin of which we snapped up and didn't regret it.
the room/cabin itself was again stunning with all the luxuries you could expect from the top ranked land based hotels, plush sumptuous, spacious warm and welcoming.
the bar although small was well stocked and the service was first class.
The Al la cart menu was simply amazing and once again the staff went to the fullest extent of their duties to make you meal the most enjoyable that it could possibly be.
the drinks were priced as they would be if you staying in any hotel in London.
Breakfast was a combination of continental and full English and was plentiful.
not much to do when on-board the hotel but then again we went for a one night stay and simply sat in the bar looking at the beautiful London skyline",5,2016,11,12
119,Great for a quiet night away,"Stayed here as a surprise birthday treat for my other half, found a deal on Groupon that included dinner. Very quirky idea putting a hotel on a yacht and loved the novelty of it! Executive standard room with excellent facilities and the king size bed was like sleeping on a cloud. Food was incredible and staff were very professional. Small issues I had: huge red wine stain on the carpet in our room on arrival? Doesn't bother me but surprised it wasn't dealt with considering the caliber of the accommodation. When we went for dinner, the waitress quite loudly told us in front of other guests that we could not eat the more expensive meal options as we only had the basic deal that we bought on Groupon (a little embarrassing as it made us look cheap although it still wasn't a cheap night!) also if you are planning on going into central London be prepared for a 45 minute tube journey and a lot of changes, it is really on the outskirts of the city!",4,2016,11,10
119,Work visit," NIce hotel, big rooms. Right. Next to the excel convention center. Overall a good experience. Free wifi.
My phone didnt have reception in the room, that was anoying for work.
Food was good, nice steak and croque madam.",5,2016,11,09
119,Hotel needs some TLC - Restaurant disappointing,"So travelled across London and raced over the dock like an excited child to this magnificent looking yacht singing 'The Love Boat' all the way! Got the lift which opened up to the gold glitz reception and spiral staircase that blows you away.  Staff very attentive and polite. Was a great start. Had decided to pay extra for the balcony room overlooking the Thames- couldn't see the point of spending a night on a luxury yacht and having a small porthole overlooking the dock. Wasn't disappointed as there is something about being on the water that is just magical.  Loved the fabulous views of Canary Wharf at night and watching the crazy people swimming in the Thames in the morning. Shame when you sit down on the balcony chair you can't see anything though but hey, I get they don't want you falling off. The room was hit and miss. Hit: lovely big comfortable bed, nice sized room with little lounge couch, fridge, coffee machine and nice bathroom. Miss: dubious looking stains on the carpet - husband thought they were red wine but looked like blood to me.  And just an overall 'tired' feel.  It's the type of place that if they don't invest now to bring it back to its former glory - will lose appeal completely.  Now for dinner. Friends had recently gone to the afternoon tea and been bitterly disappointed but this didn't put us off. It should have.  I have to say that the meal was really mediocre. I had the grilled radicchio, orange, goats cheese and pine nuts starter. The balance was totally off with a very strong balsamic, and strong bitter raddichio. Hubby's confit duck and lobster terrine was dry and tasteless. Mains weren't any better (can't even remember what we had) and the dessert was just laughable. I basically got a couple of slices of mango on a plate with vanilla ice cream and what looked like a Tesco store bought meringue nest. Not impressed!I
I think there is great potential for this venue to be absolutely spectacular. But it needs money invested. The furnishings (tables, chairs in bar and restaurant) reminded me of a typical conference centre and even though the staff were fantastic, the restaurant and 'tiredness'' lets this place down.  We still managed to have a fantastic night away from normal life - but wouldn't go back at least until they clean the carpet.",3,2016,11,09
119,Amazing from start to finish,"We arrived at our hotel via the emirates (much to my husband's displeasur, but with 2 happy boy's in tow) and were pleasantly surprised to see a lovely green area beside the hotel! After chasing the boys around for 5 minute's we headed straight to the lift and walked towards the beautifully elegant reception area. The stair's and the chandelier captured our attention and made the family even more happy with our choice. We were greeted by a very happy and friendly receptionist, who, even though she was busy, took her time to sign us in and show us the direction of our room for the night. Excited to use their card key's the boys went in search of our room and happily let themselves in. The room was clean and perfect for our night stay, with its stunning view of the docklands and the overhead sounds of the air traffic from London City Airport. We all took advantage of taking a shower, and found this an easy process. The bathroom was clean and well stocked with the usual toiletries you come to expect. We then took a little stroll and loved the freedom that being just outside of the busy hum of London gave us. The local shop's were handy and meant i could stay clear of the minibar! We had dinner at the premier inn hotel's resturant, situated at the end of the docks about 15 minute's walk from the hotel and arrived back to find the boys bed had been constructed and more toiletries redecorating the bed with some careful placed towels. A lovely note and some cakes where left for my husband (i failed to mention it was his 40th that night). The boys made a point of going out and thanking the reception team with a hug for one of them. After a beautiful nights sleep (the planes don't seem to fly after a certain time and all was peaceful) we headed for breakfast, as the only family present at the time we were seated at the far end with the stunning view's through the glass doors and our breakfast arrived swiftly, and from the mouths of babes..'it was delicious'. We left our key behind and left the hotel feeling confident that we would definitely be staying again and headed towards the docklands light railway (there was no way hubby was going on the emirates again) and enjoyed our journey back into the madness of the busy London crowds.",5,2016,11,09
119,New concept,"We booked the suite and were not disappointed.
The room was spacious and well appointed. From the deck we could see the dome in one direction and the excel to the other.
The bathroom was amazing two showers spa bath and sauna.
The restaurant had 3 menus to choose from and was overall good value.
 
If you are looking for something different and within 15 mins of the city by DLR give it a go.",5,2016,11,09
119,"Great setting, but poor service in lounge & bar area","We based ourselves in their lounge during the past two business days to hold multiple meetings with different clients. It's just outside of the Excel Exhibition Hall and the World Travel Market it on. 

We had coffee, soft drinks, sandwiches, burgers, which were all good quality.  Unfortunately the service was consistently poor.  Very very slow, but also disorganised so that the staff always seemed rushed or forgetful even during times that were not busy. 

I didn't personally stay.  One of our clients did and said the room was very nice, but the service was very poor (not sure which part of the hotel she was referring to, but I wasn't surprised).",3,2016,11,08
119,5 Star Luxury Yacht Heaven!,"I really enjoyed my stay at this unique concept 5 star location in London's docklands area.

Really close to Custom House DLR train station near Excel London.

Check in was very quick, I prearranged a non-refundable room through a well known online booking company and got a near 50% discount to enjoy.  The rooms are about £200 per night.

What did I enjoy?

The design concept (come on people, a yacht!), room (very spacious and comfortable) restaurant, has a spa, staff (very friendly, kind and helpful), locality to local transport, cool view of the lake and fantastic halfway carpets very warm and cosy.

The security locked doors concept to hallways, outside and the lift areas were all very good.",5,2016,11,07
119,Something different,"Stayed here one night and the room was really lovely, large, comfortable and extremely clean.  The staff were friendly and helpful.  The location is quite strange as its in the middle of Docklands, so nothing to do here but enjoy the boat.  Very elegant surrounding and very novel idea.  You can see most of the City from here and its close to the O2 and next to Excel.  It was winter so we didn't venture outside on deck but I could see its attraction in warmer weather.  

Dinner was good with a small but adventurous menu.  Breakfast was a little disappointing, as it was all in ""keep warm containers"" which was a disappointment as as the cost of staying on board, it should be served at the table.  It was also cold with things like butter and coffee missing from the table and had to be asked for.  Its a shame, as it could have been so much better.",4,2016,11,07

119,Special occasion that wasn't so special ,"Stayed at this hotel as it's different and quirky for a partners birthday. Book a king room with a dockside view, but before I arrived I called up to change to a river view. Once I arrived we checked in and got to our room, first impression was good but after looking in the bathroom there was a horrendous smell immediately. We then opened the curtains I had a dockside room.  I phoned guest services and was move to a riverside room. There's was a number of issues, the safe didn't work, the wood floor was all marked and scuffed, the window was dirty. I wanted to grab a shower after my journey down from Sheffield before going out for the evening and while I was in the shower, the shower screen fell onto me which was a huge health and safety breach as the glass could of shattered onto me. I was livid, I went up to guest services to complain and the told me the duty manger would ring me. Once she called I asked her to come view the room for herself, she agreed it wasn't in a safe working order and upgraded our room to an executive suite (with a dockside view). She then told us to join her in the VIP lounge at 4pm for the free bar and later we could receive a complimentary meal, which was all well and good but we had plans as it was bonfire night to go out so instead she offered us drinks vouchers and room service for when we arrived back. Upon our return we went to enquire about the room service. We got told by a very arrogant duty manger (male) she hadn't told us about the food which was a blatant lie. I am appalled by the service from the staff here. Overall i wouldn't recommend this hotel on my personal visit.",1,2016,11,05
119,Time out,"We chose the Sunborn on Secret Escapes having looked at it a few times . It was a really good deal including , afternoon tea, dinner & breakfast . The food was amazing & restaurant very polite & helpful. Couldn't fault it in anyway . 
We upgraded from an executive dock room to a riverside room which I'm glad we did as the crazy characters from the Comic con exhibition were outside the front of the yacht all day & some of the evening , although they all looked fab . The cabin was very comfortable & large . There isn't much around that area but was perfect for us as we just wanted a chilled weekend . Would thoroughly recommend. ",5,2016,11,04
119,Weekend get away for me and my wife,"We stayed for one night in an waterside room from a secrete escapes deal and it was great, chocolates and champagne with dinner all included. Service was good, booking in took longer than expected as they could not find the deal we had. The manager help and this was resolved quickly. Same happened at check out, not a problem.
Would recommend staying here as its a good location for the O2 and get the over its great. Good to spend time in London and see the sites.",5,2016,11,03
119,Not luxurious but nice place to stay,"I have stayed near excel many times and as I was taking my husband to cycling at the Olympic park I thought something a bit different was called for.  The boat is not a luxury hotel despite the bling in reception. Only one entrance lift was working so it took some time to get into the hotel. Rooms are very large but basic, the carpets need a good clean as there were stains on them. I asked for a couple more coffee pods which were delivered to room whilst we were out.  Staff are all extremely pleasant.  I asked if there were any rooms with a bath and was told there are only showers in the hotel.  I don't think this is the case but for overnight stay it didn't matter.  Having spent a long day in London and the Olympic park I was looking forward to a good night's rest.  Unfortunately there was a very loud knocking sound at side of boat which vibrated through the bed.  I spent the night on the sofa as it was too loud to be able to sleep. I didn't want to change rooms in the middle of the night but I wish I had as when I returned home I was exhausted and didn't feel I had a nice break away. The duty manager came to our room next morning and agreed the noise was not acceptable and said we should have requested a change of room.  She deducted 50% from our bill as we did not have a pleasant peaceful stay. Breakfast had plenty of choice but needs to be hotter as indicated by previous reviews. I think the hotel next door is better value for money with lovely bathrooms.",3,2016,11,01
119,"Girlfriend Catch-up""","We both had a wonderful stay here last Wednesday 26th October.  The rooms were just as shown on the Website and the staff were very friendly, especially Vadim.  We both said it would be great to return so with time and planning, we hope to do so.  Really great stay.",5,2016,11,01
119,Quirky hotel with a few service issues,"We spent a night at this hotel recently after reading good reviews previously. The hotel itself is very clean and looks impressive with all the polished wood and glass/mirror finishes. Rooms are very comfortable and spacious with nice touches such as the Nespresso machine and tablet - although there were only 2 milk capsules in our room so obviously they weren't expecting you to enjoy too much coffee! The bed was comfortable and all the linen and toiletries were good quality. The minibar fridge was rather noisy so did wake me up a few times in the night. Breakfast was good value and was very nice, with hot and cold buffet available.
My main issue with the hotel was the service and attitude of the staff which was not up to the standards I had expected. We arrived at about 12.30 so tried to check in but our room wasn't ready (check-in is 3pm). I asked if it was possible that our room might be available before 3pm but was told that it wasn't. We finally did get our key at 3pm, but there was no attempt to see if another room was ready - it was a flat ""no"" and came across as being unhelpful and uncooperative. I know the hotel was busy, but the attitude of the front desk staff was not welcoming. We went to the bar to wait for our room to be ready, but until you have a room number you can only get 20 minutes of guest WIFI. 
We were told that our bags would be taken to our room as we were going out for the remainder of the day. When we arrived back at around midnight there was no sign of our bags in the room. I tried calling the front desk about 4 times and each time I was cut off halfway through my conversation. Eventually they did bring the bag, but it had taken about half an hour by this time.
We had stayed there with other family members. When they tried to check in they were told that there was no booking in their name. We knew this to be untrue because when we checked in, they had asked which of the 2 rooms under that surname was ours. The staff again were not very friendly and took some time to resolve the issue - which eventually turned out to be their mistake as they had checked in both rooms at the same time. 
This is a nice hotel, in a good location and some of the staff were helpful, but it was let down by the attitude of front desk staff. There is a way to treat paying customers and we all felt that they fell short of the standards we were expecting. If they could iron those out then I would be happy to recommend.",3,2016,11,01
119,Fantastically different,"This hotel is lovely. The decor is gorgeous and the whole experience is different and feels special. Staff were lovely, rooms very comfortable. We had the best buffet breakfast we've ever had.
The location is a stone's throw from the excel and 10 minutes door to door of the O2 if you use the cable car.",5,2016,11,01
119,Special visit,"Super novel hotel. Rooms beautiful very shiny and full facilities including a tablet and own nespresso machine. 
Had meal in the restaurant and staff very attentive , lovely meal. Breakfast plentiful. Dining room has fab views.
Disappointed that spa was closed for refurb
Would return",4,2016,10,31
119,Lovely Night at The Sunborn,Stayed at The Sunborn after a day at Comic Con with my teenage daughter. It was perfect the staff were friendly & courteous. We got a choice of rooms and once we were in our room it was very nice spotlessly clean with a view over the conference centre. If you have event business or pleasure in Docklands this is an ideal place to stay. ,4,2016,10,31
119,Fabulous,"Have sailed on all 3 Cunard ships and the Sunborn Yacht is just as elegant.  Chose this to celebrate our 40 years since meeting.  A unique experience with an amazing view of the O2 and Canary Wharf.  Paid extra for an Executive Dock View room which was beautiful with bathrobes and slippers, comfortable bed, coffee machine, balcony, TV and room service.  Lovely bar with outside terrace and cocktails.  Food in the restaurant was delicious.  Highly recommended, especially if you are celebrating a special occasion, spemdimg the day at the Excel Centre, or after an evening at the O2.",5,2016,10,30
119,Static cruise experience,Good for romantic couple stay. Silent and honeymoon like stay. 5 star service. Elegant food. Smell the sea.  Also good and convenient for the trade fair visitors and exhibitors in excel. Strongly Recommended. ,4,2016,10,30
119,Very good. ,"We stayed in a family room for 1 night (2adults and 1 child). Unable to check in early which is fair enough so off we went into London for the day. Parking is £15 for 24 hours in the close by Royal Victoria car park. Only a 2 minute walk to the Emirates air line cable cars across the Thames to the o2 then about 15 minutes on the tube to Waterloo. 
On our return we checked in immediately and went to our large family room, an excellent size for London. It was well equipped, comfortable beds, nice river view and luxury Molton Brown toiletries. The only problem was the temperature of the room. It was far too hot and as we didn't check in until the evening, there wasn't time to cool it down. Despite turning the heating off and using the supposed cool air fans, it was far too hot and a shame as it spoiled our sleep and our stay. 
Otherwise it was excellent and I would use again. ",4,2016,10,30
119,Quality on board,"What a place. Reception was amazing, rooms lovely and clean. Spacious room and bathroom.
Easy to get to and parking is five mins easy walk.
Drinking in the bar outside area was amazing looking over to the 02 arena. 
Very relaxing break highly recommended.",5,2016,10,29
119,View to die for ,"We have just come back from a couple of days in London , the location for the sunborn is just perfect as you get to use the cable car to get to the hotel which is a novelty in itself , we used the river clipper boats for the rest of our travels in London from North Greenwich which made for the stress free break we had wished for , the highlight has to be the view from the restaurant of the Thames with a sunset that beats any we have seen abroad , with the O2, Thames and cable car amongst the view , huge and very clean room  ",5,2016,10,28
119,Great unusual hotel,"Stayed for a family break before and now on business. The staff were very attentive and went over and above that of any other palace I'd stayed. The rooms have heated floors in the bathroom and thickly piled very luxurious carpets. River View is a must, had that last time but this time had a view of the Excel not quite so glamorous.

",4,2016,10,27
119,Birthday surprise,"Had a enjoyable night away for partner's birthday . Booked the romantic package which included dinner, bed and breakfast. Room was lovely but only inland view of exel centre. Dinner very good but did have to remind waiter we were supposed to get a complimentary glass of champagne (funny as the young couple next table had to ask the same thing!) Bit embarrassing! Staff all friendly that we met.
Had one drink each in the bar after dinner bill came to not far short of £30 (service added to bill ) , did feel like I'd had open wallet surgery! Breakfast good but self service. Would recommend for a special occasion but certainly not cheap! ",4,2016,10,26
119,Family treat,"Stayed here primarily because of our kids attending an event at the O2.
I arrived late in from work, wife had already check in and was enjoying the hotel. I left early for work next day so was unable to enjoy or sample breakfast but the family told me they enjoyed it all.

For an event at either the O2 or attending Excel j think this is a novel and great place to stay. ",4,2016,10,26
119,The WOW Factor ,"Booked this as a surprise for my husband as part of a belated retirement celebration. Didn't disappoint.  Had an executive river view room with the Romantic Package. Everywhere is scrupulously clean.  Staff very friendly and welcoming. Nothing too much trouble. Delicious 3 course dinner and nice breakfast, although plates could have been hotter. Definitely recommend for a special treat.",5,2016,10,25
119,ship shape,"This venue was a lot of fun to stay at. I am prepared to guess that you could find cheaper accommodation with maybe more facilities but for the shear glam factor I rate the Sunborn as well worth it.
It looks exactly as you would imagine a super yacht to look but it was actually custom built as a hotel and has 5 decks for accommodation.
We paid for an upgrade and had a balcony suite which was roomy and comfortable.
The breakfast was fairly standard but plentiful with a wide selection of things to get you well sorted for a day out.
I think if you were looking for accommodation with a difference with good transport links to central London, the LDR is within 100 metres and London city airport close by then give this a try",4,2016,10,25
119,A different experience....,"We stayed in Room 1038. It was very noisy, I think it was the air conditioning - even though it was switched off, but not sure. Didn't have a good night's sleep. The carpet could have done with a clean. It was nice to have a sitting area, but for price I paid I expected a room with a balcony not one below decks with a port hole - certainly didn't look like the picture when booking on Hotels.com so be careful what you book. It certainly was different but wouldn't go again.",4,2016,10,24
119,Quirky and fun ,"What a cool thing to do as an alternative to a standard London hotel. 

It's a great quirky place! It's a little out of town so takes a while to get where you want to go but worth the trip. 

The rooms aren't as plush as I imagined they would be, but everything you need is there and it's all clean and tidy. 

Was fun waking up and going out on the balcony to watch the Sunday swimmers along the Thames! 

Great good, great staff. A fun thing to do ",4,2016,10,24
119,"Impressed? Yes, but...","Just returned from a lovely weekend with my wife.  Impressed? Yes, but...

My wife booked via Secret Escapes.  It was a reasonable deal, with dinner and full English/breakfast bar included. We really loved the location. The space of being by the old docks takes away that sometimes hemmed in feeling, which London can provide.  The weather was really quite exceptional for the time of year, which added to our enjoyment. 

We liked the Sunborn, we really did, although with only one of the two lifts working, that soon became tiresome. 

Booking in and check out went well. Plenty of efficient staff. 

The room (2009) was lovely, although why say there is a mini bar if it only has two bottles of water in. Oh, the door doesn't close well either, so it was cool rather than cold. 

I had read reviews that commented on stains on the carpet and ours certainly had some good ones on it. The Executive room was good. Nice size, with a good sized shower cubicle. The bed was ok too, good size.  The Samsung TV which although it was a reasonable size, could have delivered a better picture. I thought it insipid. I had hoped for more than Freeview too.

The Lands End restaurant was very good. Excellent service and food which met expectation.

I thought the inclusive breakfast excellent, accompanied by an excellent coffee.

So, any problems? Mmmmmmm, noise. That was about the worst sleep we have had since a tortuous night some years ago in a Travelodge with Mari using drunkards running along the corridor. The cause this time was possibly just noisy staff. So far as I could work out, the noise came from directly overhead and that appeared to be a staff area adjacent  to reception. There was an exceptionally noisy door, or is that an average door used improperly by unthoughtful staff? Jury is out. It certainly went on all night, interspersed with some very noisy chair movement...

Looking at the rear of the yacht hotel, looks like it could do with a coat of paint, a bit like they constantly do on cruise ships. 

That said, all in all it was nice. But the company and a brilliant trip on the Emirates Air Line made it really memorable.",4,2016,10,23
119,Overnight stay,"Beautiful hotel. Stayed here overnight for my birthday. Rooms were very clean & staff very welcoming & helpful. Considering it is close to city airport we did not hear the planes at all. Would definitely stay again 
",5,2016,10,23
119,Trip with the mother in law,This was mainly booked for my mother in law as she loves boats and it ticked all the boxes she was so happy we did not eat here as had booked a few other bits as her birthday treat we where not disappointed.,5,2016,10,23
119,Awesome ,"Dear Lord!! Opulence to the extreme , surprise gift from son one night on this magnificent yacht , feeling like royalty it was Devine , room beautiful , quiet and so relaxing , had drinks on deck overlooking the London skyline it was just breathtaking . Thank you to all concerned  will definitely be coming back. 😊",5,2016,10,23
119,Excellent Hotel ,"Love this Hotel and if you look at different sites you can get for real good price. Service was excellent rooms fantastic would upgrade to a water view room. 

Yaught looks amazing quality quality well worth money. I would definitely book to go again love it",4,2016,10,21
119,Last Minute Gem,"I stayed here with my boyfriend last minute a few days ago.

It's really easy to find but no parking available. The car park near the crowne plaza is £15 flat rate.

The check in was quick and the staff were polite.

Ordered room service which took a while to come but was ok.

The room was spacious and clean and I can't fault my stay. Would recommend and would stay longer next time so I can use the spa.",5,2016,10,21
119,Business & family trip ,Excellent accommodation with great hospitality nearby Excel London make it more convenient to attend seminar etc. Nearby DLR Custom House station or may option for Emirates Cable car within 5 minutes walking from the hotel. ,4,2016,10,20
119,Amazing,"Wow what a fantastic place to stay, my husband took me here for my birthday we stayed in an executive suite, the suite was very luxurious. We had dinner in the restaurant which was absolutely delicious and worth every penny,
Staff were very friendly and helpful. I would definitely recommend staying here.",5,2016,10,19
119,Life on a Yacht,"A night on a luxury yacht sounded good, and it met our expectations, and more.
Our room was very clean and roomy,nice comfortable settee, with TV etc. The evening meal was good with lovely views over the docks. Break fast was just as good.  Every thing was very good with very friendly and helpful staff.  There was only one small thing which let it down was only two milks for the tea and coffee making, not even begin to be enough. But apart from this small item we had a great weekend and would difinatly visit again.",5,2016,10,18
119,Sunborn Yacht,"We went for a 1 night stay and from the moment we arrived we were treated exceptionally well , we did both use the spa (which was pre-booked) whilst it was OK we both felt it was a little pricey .. the room was excellent , and we ate on board and the food was fantastic and very reasonably priced , would definitely recommend to anyone to go and stay there .",5,2016,10,18
119,Visited for a drink,Were due to stay here in November for a weekend. So thought why we were in the area we would call by and take a look. Wow it looks incredible inside and had a couple of drinks at the bar. Shame the weather wasn't a little warmer as we could of sat on the deck but still had great views from the bar area. Food looked delicious too! Cant wait to stay.,5,2016,10,18
119,Very nice boat,Staff were lovley and couldn't do enough to help you. Was disappointed to see lots of stains on the carpet and a very stained sink. the bed was very comfortable and everything else was just perfect ..,4,2016,10,18
119,An amazing hotel,"From the moment you arrive this place is the place to be.  The reception area, is opulent, with a huge chandelier   sitting in the middle of the circular staircase,  Every where is decorated to a very high standard.  The bedrooms have a wow factor.  they are spacious and decorated to a high standard.  Would definitely go back.  Every staff member was professional, helpful and friendly.  We could not fault this hotel.",5,2016,10,17
119,Salon international ,"Every year my friend Louise and I have gaze lovinley over at the Yacht when we arrive to Salon international . This year we decided to forfill our dream and stay over . 
We booked a family room . Check in was prompt ...The room was fabulous and so was the rest of the Yacht . The drinks were very expensive although food ie bar snack was well worth what I had , but my friends prawn salad had 3 prawns so she wasn't so happy . Service in bar was somewhat slow and felt like we were bothering the waiters although they were polite ...just not forthcoming . Family room you'd expect coffee tea for four ...only had one hot chocolate no milk and 2 bottles of water ...family would suggest wed have more of everything but no ...not even a biscuit !!! 
The fun started in middle of the night ...my friend was kept awake all night by the sound of a fridge that clicked in and out and sounded like a hairdryer . She didn't wake me or ring reception as that would have disturbed me . Kind friend . But tried desperately to unplug it but short of having a screw  driver as it was completly encased and no way of getting at the plug . We told receptionist and she really did not seem to care . 
All in all I'd say I enjoyed our vist but my friend didn't and it really didn't live up to the dream we'd created over the years . 
Next year's show . We will be staying in the IBIS ...could not fault that and it is half the price . ",3,2016,10,17
119,Olga & My AWESOMELY OUTSTANDING stay at the Sunborn,"Olga & I came to the Sunborn London as it is so near to the O2 Arena as we where going to see Jean Michel Jarre that evening. From check in to check out we couldn't have done more for us. To have a surprise invite to join Maryiam on the the Sundeck lounge (fifth floor , which was our floor) for drink & nibbles was a very gracious gift and greatly recieved. 5 mins walk to the Emirates skyline cable , so getting to the O2 was very easy indeed. Balcony looking over the river was great and watching the planes land at the city airport was a highlight for Olga (as she loves planes and took many photos of them. The noon checkout was such a nice gesture as after the concert , we retired to the hotel and sat in our chairs on our river facing baclony drinking and still buzzing from the JMJ concert , looking over to the O2 and feeling the energy. Check out was prompt , professional. Would we return , yes without a shadow of a doubt , especially if attending a concert at the O2.",5,2016,10,15
119,60th Birthday Celebration,"Went to the Sunborn Yacht Hotel for my partner's 60th birthday . We chose the Ultimate Romantic Getaway Package , and it really was fabulous!  The room was huge and spacious and we were even given complimentary wine and card for my partners birthday, which was a lovely touch. Prior to our evening meal we were invited to the VIP lounge for  complimentary drinks by Maryiam which was a lovely touch. Maryiam made us most welcome and chatted with us, took photos and have to say she is an absolute credit to Sunborn!  What a fantastic member of staff you have in her!  Our meal in the restaurant was excellent as too was our breakfast.  Thoroughly enjoyed our stay and will   Most definitely be returning. Excellent!!
",5,2016,10,15
119,Excel expo - best location ,"I stayed here for one night whilst attending an expo. The location is amazing and great to bring clients to for a drink . Rooms are well finished and to a high standard . I had a room with a balcony, which being a smoker was great. One problem was breakfast, it's over priced. And bizarrely the four members of my team, all had the same price charged to them for breakfast, except one, whose was £4 more expensive? When question was told it was there tip!! Even though 12.5% service charged has been added already!! ",5,2016,10,14
119,"Extremely Average, get more for your money else where","I booked the Sunborn as I came across a discounted room on booking.com, and what with staying on a yacht in London it seemed quite the novelty and I expected it to be a glamorous experience , considering the price tag. The offer was a room at £180 instead of £240 for one night.

First impression outside of the Sunborn, as probably could be expected, a little rundown and out dated. The entrance is nice with bright blue/purple lights and the sign looks modern, but on the inside the decor is extremely out dated, can be compared to a cheap cruise ship, tacky almost. The carpets are the biggest let down as they show the age of the boat and decor, covered in scuff marks, which was consistent on entrance in to our room for the night.   

Our room was small but that's to be expected from a boat/ cabin room. We stayed on the top level with a room facing out to the water with a balcony. Our carpets had makeup marks on the floor, we had a coffee machine but no coffee or cups, no guest book, and no guidance from the receptionist at all on check out times, or the fact we had a 'tablet' which Is to be used for the likes of room service or any other service for that matter. The bed was comfy-ish, the pillows were naff, the remote for the t.v was disgusting and balcony wasn't particularly clean ether. 

The bathroom was cleanish, apart from the curly hair in the shower and marks on the tiles. The only thing that I was impressed with was how clean the mirrors were, spotless and no streaks!

Breakfast was extremely overpriced at £19.50 for a bog standard self serviced breakfast bar with no frills other than seasoned mushrooms. 

Room service was also a huge disappointment. Microwaved pizza and a Brie sandwich, both flavourless. We complained and they removed it from our bill.

All in all I am being very critical as the room was not cheap, with the receptionist implying it was a very nice room. I would
Honestly say a premier inn would be my preferred choice after staying at the Sunborn, it's extremely overrated, I would not consider it a 4 star in the slightest, completely mediocre and I cannot emphasis enough how outdated it was on the decor front. 

",3,2016,10,14
119,Night at the 02,"Great hotel for access to the 02 arena. 

Something a little different, not many can say they've stayed in a Luxury Super Yacht.

5 mins walk to the Emirates skyline cable car past a few restaurants and bars. Cable car over to the 02 took 10 mins and then 10 mins walk to the 02 and all the bars and restaurants there. So very good location for that and the Excel, however a little far out if you want to venture closer to the city.

The hotel was spotless, really clean and a little upgrade upon check in was most welcome. Balcony looking over the river was great and watching the planes land at the city airport was a highlight ( for me at least! )

Breakfast in the room was great, even though i was a little worse for wear! - Lovely cooked breakfast, hot and on time.

The staff were very friendly and helpful, the room was as we expected for the price we paid, but the experience overall of the yacht was great. Nice that its a 12noon checkout too.

i would highly recommend this place, would have liked to have stated longer.

Parking is 5 mins walk away and costs £15 per 24hrs, which again, for London is cheap",5,2016,10,14
119,BIRTHDAY CELEBRATION,"We stayed at the Sunborn Yacht Hotel, London, for my partners birthday on 10th Oct 16'; we had a wonderful time; the boat is breathtaking & the interior especially the entrance is very grand indeed; we booked Dinner for two & was seated by the window, with spectacular views; service was exceptional, Carolina our server was fabulous; attentive & accommodating to our every need with a smile; she recommended the Lobster which we ordered, it was absolutely superb. They were aware of my Partner Ian’s Birthday & they did a lovely dessert platter. They also were aware of his food allergy which they catered for.
We then went to the Bar for champagne; where we sampled a type of jelly shot/cocktail a new initiative by Jay & Alex who offered exceptional service.

Only negative & this was due to the chambermaid staff not the hotel; on first entry to our room; the Bed was not completely made so the initial wow factor we expected was not there (not as in the pictures) we contacted reception whereby they sent a member of staff to rectify; we went to reception & spoke with the manager who apologised upgraded us & gave us complimentary drinks; The upgrade was superb.",5,2016,10,14
119,Somewhat unusual but nice.,"It would be interesting to understand the numbers which compare the commissioning a floating hotel with a brick-and-mortar one. Whatever they are, the result is a very comfortable space for guests. The rooms are generous by London standards (smallish bathrooms, but big enough for the purpose). The rooms are clean and pleasant, with an abundance of wood panelling. The hotel lounge and deck offer good views of the river, with the added entertainment of being on the final approach path for City Airport (although we never heard a plane from our room). The breakfasts were good (although the staff seemed a bit stretched on our final Sunday morning). The restaurant is expensive, but there are several more reasonable options within walking distance. The Docklands Light Railway is only a few minutes away, and trains to and from London are frequent.
We had originally booked a room with a ""porthole"" window, but we found that this could not be opened. Not liking to sleep with the air conditioner running, we elected to upgrade to a room with a balcony (which had the added benefit of breakfast included), where we could leave the balcony door open at night for fresh air. Our ""cabin"" faced the dock rather than the river, but this proved to be absolutely no problem.
The desk staff were friendly and efficient, both at check-in and in dealing with the room upgrade.
We would definitely stay here again.",4,2016,10,12
119,Pleasant but a few things lacking ,"Stayed here for one night before moving on to another hotel for a family party, first impressions very glamorous and glitzy but lacking any customer service on check in, room was great, clean spacious and a great view, bathroom had a hand Molton brown soap, shampoo and a conditioner, no shower gel, not very 5 star even premier inns supply shower gel. Had a few drinks in the hotel bar and a snack which was beautifully presented and great service so full marks there, next morning I tried several times to make a coffee in the machine in the room but it didn't work, as we were getting close to check out time I gave up and pointed out the couple of points when to reception when asked if we enjoyed our stay. The receptionist reply was you should of reported this at the time. Overall a nice novelty stunning hotel but let down by lack of customer service at reception and attention to detail of the little things. ",4,2016,10,12
119,Cruising without moving,"Fantastic room with great view and quality fittings, air con worked beautifully and was easy to operate, the bed was superb as were the bathroom and toiletries. Staff were amazing in particular at the reception, if you're looking for a great London experience without the crowds and stress Docklands is a must as is Sunborn",5,2016,10,11
119,Over priced and poor service,"I would write a long and detailed review but I do not wish to be reminded of the poor service we received.

The boat is beautiful, and our room was comfortable and warm. 

Afternoon tea was enjoyable and everything was tasty other than the brownies. 

Breakfast was cold and not what i would expect from a hotel of this standard.",2,2016,10,11
119,Amazing customer service and lovely hotel,"Booked a room for the Saturday the 8th of October (my boyfriends birthday) got a birthday package and breakfast in the room for an amazing price. 
Everything was done just the way I asked for, beautiful king room, very organized and super attentive staff. 
We will defiantly be coming back and hopefully going to the one in Gilbraltar in New years eve. 
a shout out to Sandra at the reception (I think that is her name) she was lovely. 
Thank you for the breakfast It was absolutely fab worth the price.",5,2016,10,11
119,Perfect Location,"Booked to stay here with my wife for 3 nights (11th-13th August) which was a very popular time. We managed to get 2 nights  in a Riverside view room and the 3rd night in a Riverside view with balcony.

Our Son was getting married at a church near Stratford and having the reception at Tereza Joanna which is next to City of London Airport, so we wanted a location that was central to both, so this seemed like a good one. In addition to that many of our friends and family members that were also going to the wedding had booked in at various hotels nearby (Aloft, Hilton, Ibis, Travelodge etc) for a price that was not too dissimilar to what we were paying for this. 

My wife also thought we were staying in a Travelodge/Ibis and it's only after we got out of the car and started walking along the dock towards the yacht that she realized. The vessel really does cut an impressive figure in the water and stands out from everything else around. The boat sits right outside the London Excel Center, near to The Emirates Cable Car Ride, close to 2 (LDR) tube stations. There is also ample parking close by. 

When we boarded the vessel and went up to the reception area we could feel the wow factor. Once we checked in we were given vouchers to get 2 glasses of champagne from the bar which we thought was a rather nice touch. Our cabin was clean, spacious, large comfortable bed with nice views over the water. On our 3rd night we had a balcony cabin which was a larger room with an additional sofa/bed. Having the balcony was an additional treat and I definitely got some ""brownie points"" for that.

We booked on a b&b basis so enjoyed a nice breakfast every morning.We had a snack in the main restaurant which was very filling and we thought good value for money. Our favorite part though was at the main bar at the stern of the boat. In the afternoon we sat outside enjoying the glorious sunshine and drinking champagne.

We found the service on board to be very good and had no complaints whatsoever.
We had a wonderful stay and plan to stay here in future if we need to stop over in London. Special thanks to Jay(told you Usain Bolt would do it), Olivia and a very nice Polish Barman whose name I cannot remember.",5,2016,10,11
119,"Excellent service, friendly staff","Friendly and helpful staff, good breakfast buffet tidy and large room. I loved the sweets in the room and a personal welcome note. Check in went smooth, my only feedback from my last stay was the hassle to get on the free internet (after check in, it was all fine, but I arrived early morning, with a busy schedule, and a very busy reception, so I think that could be made complimentary) ",5,2016,10,11
119,Tis a stunning sight to behold!,"Our breath was taken away by the majesty of this vessel and the prices!
The cabin could not have been better, with doors onto a deck overlooking the Thames.
Only two teabags and no milk!
As the old seagdog saying goes ""This ship was being spoiled by a hayporth of tar.""
The service was excellent.
It` seemed silly for us to pay the obligatory £20 for breakfast because we only usually eat a bowl of cereals and take a cup of tea. We gave it a miss.
It is a lovely hotel make no mistake and well worth the money. We would not have missed the exoerience.",4,2016,10,10
119,Birthday Treat,"We were really looking forward to this surprise trip, after looking at the Web site. A bit disappointed as a wedding party was going on and we're not told about this, no room service because of this and a bit noisy - we were expecting a pool on the boat but no pool, tried to follow the signs to the ""wheelhouse"" couldn't fins anywhere.
We have certainly stayed at better hotels for the same price.
Good location and great breakfast 😁",3,2016,10,10
119,Posh yacht experience all in the heart of Newham!,"I booked a 2-night stay as a treat and whilst the 'promotional' cost was eye-watering, it was a lovely experience. The staff were very friendly, rooms 'on point' and food absolutely delicious. 

My main gripe is that a few days before my stay, I was told that the spa would be unavailable. A very expensive stay without a spa indeed! It wasn't until I checked in that use of an alternative hotel spa was offered (should have told me this before), at a 'discounted rate' of £10. I met with several other guests who had not been made aware; the spa was a 'pull' factor for them. Sunborn should note this fact and consider offering a proper spa - not just two treatment rooms - when the service is available. They would be onto a winner!",4,2016,10,10
119,Awesome hotel,"Stayed here for 2 nights, room was amazing with views of river with balcony. Staff were very polite and helpful very clean and excellent value for money considering its in London would defiantly stay here again",5,2016,10,09
119,Our London experience ,"What a wonderful weekend we had on the sunborn London, the cabins were great with all the facilities you could want, the atmosphere on aboard was relaxed and the staff very helpful and friendly, 
The location of the hotel is perfect for exploring London, we took the cable car over to the O2, which was great fun, and the access to central London was very easy with the DLR only a short walk from the hotel, we enjoyed a fantastic meal at Wright Brothers fish restaurant, and then a few drinks around soho, 
If you are looking for something a little bit special as a treat for a loved one, the sunburn London will give you just that ",5,2016,10,05
119,A bit disappointed,"We booked this hotel via an offer on secretescapes so we did get an deal on the stay, however it still was a lot of money. On arriving at the boat first impressions are great, check in was friendly, the reception area looks lovely with a sweeping staircase.   We stayed in room 3021 overlooking the dock and excel centre, would have been nice to have river views but understand not everyone can have these. 
The room is a great size, bed really comfy and large, heated floor in the bathroom and  the style is just as you would expect from a boat. 
Our package included wine in the room, when we got to the to the room it wasn't in there, went back to reception where they said it's not in there as we didn't know when you would like it. Surely this should be asked on check in then? 
We also had to ask for shower gel as there wasn't any in the room, I had checked on the website before coming which said this was all there. We asked for this shortly after arriving at 3pm, and a further 2 times after this, finally getting some shower gel at 11.40!!!
We had to ask for more tea and milk too as there was only 2 tea bags and milk in the room. 
At Breakfast the following morning, the buffet looked great, lots of choice from fruit, pastries and cooked options, however when eating the cooked food from the buffet it was cold. We did mention to the waiting staff that it was cold and she did offer us a freshly cooked breakfast however had eaten other stuff by then so declined. 
Overall I think this place could be a great hotel, however for me with the price we paid the basic simple things make such a difference, and to have to keep asking for things in a hotel of this standard shouldn't happen. The breakfast should either be freshly cooked, or kept at a suitable temperature.
Unfortunately we wouldn't return or recommend this place to anyone as just don't feel with these niggles it justifies the cost.

119,Mixed service with a hint of sarcasm!!,"We went here as a treat from my daughter, to celebrate my wife's birthday. We had the tea, cakes, sandwiches in the afternoon.
Lovely surroundings, great views and parts of the experience were very nice.
Sandwiches exceptional, coffee for me was nice but my wife returned one cup of hers as it was full of coffee grains. One of the cake selection, a mini brownie tasted like cardboard. The most annoying part was right at the start when we were asked by a waitress if we wanted water and we said yes, within less than a second she produced a bottle opened it and poured. I asked if it was included in the price and she said no. I said you didn't mention that before you quickly poured it and very rudely I was told you didn't ask, resulting in her prancing off to the kitchen without another word. In the event it was not added to the bill, probably because I questioned it, nevertheless we could have done without the attitude!!!",3,2016,10,04
119,Will return,"I stayed on the Sunborn last night, with my husband and friends, which was an excellent experience.  Dockside view (ExCel Centre) room 3041 was clean, spacious and light. The bar and housekeeping staff were polite and helpful.  Vadim on reception provided a professional service and was helpful with advice about restaurants and facilities in the local area.  I travel with work and stay at hotels often and this is one of the quieter hotels I've experienced.  While some activities of other quests could be heard, which is only to be expected, it wasn't intrusive.  We look forward to returning.",5,2016,10,02
119,Wonderful ,"My partner and I stayed for one night on a Groupon deal £119 which was a suite with dock view. We parked nearby in Excel - £15 for 24 hours. First impression- luxurious reception. Very professional friendly staff. Our suite was lovely - spacious, massive comfortable bed with nice bedding. TV, coffee machine - could have had more supply of coffee/milk. No hot chocolate or biscuits. Lovely bathroom with Molten Brown products. Nice large towels. Fixtures and fittings were immaculate and luxurious. We ate out as restaurant was fine dining and not to our taste but if you get the cable car over to Greenwich there are loads of restaurants... a night trip on cable car is a must. The views are amazing. We came back and had drinks on the terrace overlooking the Thames ... lovely and relaxed. Drinks were usual London prices. We had an incredible time and will definitely return and would recommend for a special night.",5,2016,10,02
119,"Mixed feelings, displeased with service but nice facilities and room","Now I booked this hotel as a birthday surprise for my woman, and booked specifically a river view on the Internet. Booking this river view cost me £34 more than an ordinary dock view. 
I get there to check in and Filip is the man on the desk. Now this is where the problem begins. We get to the room and find we have a view of the dock. To transfer to a riverview room it will cost an extra £20 even though it's already cost me more than necessary and at midnight the likelihood of someone coming and paying for that riverview room is slim to none yet, Filip won't change the room. Didn't try and contact the company to figure this out or in anyway look after the customers (myself) which is not good. He done nothing but stand there a repeatedly say yes we can move you for an extra £20. 
Now this displeased me greatly. 

The room was nice. Facilities nice. But the bed was not comfortable. But waking up to a carpark ruined my stay considering if I wanted to wake up to a terrible view I would have just found a cheap hotel in the city. So thanks for that. So to conclude for the price I paid to be disappointed, I wasn't left with a good taste in my mouth upon checking out. Yes it only takes one thing to ruin a night. And if you like overpaying for a night out and an uncomfortable sleep this is the place to stay.",2,2016,10,01
119,Birthday suprise,"My other half took me here for a surprise birthday night away. 
The concept of the hotel is great particularly as I love yachts & being on water.

The suite we stayed in was beautifully done, the bed was large & good quality bedding. The bathroom was a good size with Molton Brown products. We had a balcony overlooking the city and the sunrise was pretty.

We didn't rate the breakfast as it was luke warm as it had been out in the dining area. We ate at 08:30
so it wasn't late into the dining times.

The biggest disspointment for my boyfriend was that on arrival when the receptionist checked us in she said how much it was to pay and asked him if wanted to pay more to upgrade. As this was a surprise & I am guessing many of the guests who stay are there was a celebration, it would be good to be more discreet as this ruined it for him and he was quite angry about how the receptionist went about this. 

I would love to stay again but this is a one off treat at the price it costs (now I know)",4,2016,09,30
119,A Real Mixture and Different,"First the good things....Parking was very easy in Excel , the service was excellent especially Gery who looked after us very well during our evening meal , the room was lovely with a very nice view , and the restaurant was delightful to be in with an exceptional view of the city at night.Now for the downside ...the food is very average in the evening , breakfast is a mixed bag with some things being lovely ...the croissants....and others not so good for example the food was not kept hot , the bacon had been frozen yet the sausages were great.A mixed bag but well worth a try because everybody wants to please...",4,2016,09,30
119,Really bad service in afternoon tea ,"We booked a table for 8 for an afternoon tea on a Sunday. After all the reviews we checked and obviously the yacht thing experience, we were expecting to have an unforgettable experience. Unfortunately this did not happen. They offered us a table just close to the stairs and close to a wedding celebration , when sometimes we felt a bit uncomfortable as we were surrounded by guests and we did not have  privacy. What we don't understand is why they did not offered us a table in the restaurant were other guest were having the afternoon tea, when we saw there was enough space for us. 
We ordered and we luckily were served by a lovely waitress , if I'm not mistaken was from Dominica republic. Impeccable service. When we decided to order the refill of the sandwiches the waiter advice us due to the wedding celebration they were going to take 15 min for the refill. We agreed and what happened next was, after 30 min of waiting and obviously being ignored by waiters my colleague went to speak to the receptionist and explain what was happening. Having even complained, it took another 30 min to bring us two trays of sandwiches with only two varieties of the 4 we requested. 1 hour waiting for 2 sandwiches???? On top of this, when we requested the bill we realised that they were charging the service charge. I can understand is a company policy, but after all the incidents that we had, it would have been great  to have omitted the charge. 
knowing you had a wedding and you could not provide the service, why did you confirm our booking? ",1,2016,09,29
119,Anniversary made special,We booked the romantic getaway for our anniversary and it was lovely. From check-in until check-out I couldn't fault it. It was our 1st wedding anniversary and the stay here made it one to remember. I would definitely go back here. Would definitely recommend paying the little extra for a river view as the view is beautiful. Staff very friendly and professional. Room was perfect. Very nice dinner and breakfast too. Honesty can't wait to stay again,5,2016,09,29
119,An unusual anniversary treat.,"We stayed here for one night to celebrate many many years of marriage. Rather than stay in hotel in central London we thought this would be different.
Arrived about 20 minutes before check in and our room wasn't ready but it wasn't a problem and we sat in the bar and had a light lunch and some drinks. The lady from reception came and told us when the room was ready. Our case had already been taken to the room. May have been nice if we had been shown our room rather than told its up the stairs and at the end of the corridor but that's me being petty.
Our room was stunning, probably the best one on the boat. It was a large suite with 2 showers, jacuzzi bath and our own sauna but best of all was a huge balcony which was big enough for at least 12'people. It,was river side too.  The room was clean, the towels soft and enormous and slippers and bathrobes were provided. Wifi was good. 
We had booked a table for dinner and requested a window seat if possible. They were all occupied but we had a drink in the bar and a lady came to tell us when a window table was free.  Dinner was excellent and service good.
Breakfast was buffet style and we were not offered anything freshly cooked like omelettes but the buffet was fairly hot and there was a good selection of fruit etc.
We had a great experience here and I liked the location - close to the cable car and very easy for us to go and explore Greenwich.
I have given this hotel a rating of 4 as a few little things needed to be ironed out but it wouldn't take a lot for me to give it 5.",4,2016,09,29
119,Not a bad place to stay,"This is an unusual hotel - we stayed for two nights. Ok getting there - we flew to Gatwick and got a taxi in to the hotel. First little issue was that when we stopped the hotel was not in sight - strange as it's pretty large! Walk on a  little further along the street (which is a cup-de-sac) the Sunborn becomes very evident. First impressions - very nice!
Checking in - strictly at 1500 - we spent a couple of hours in the bar - great - the sun was shining and (despite other reviews was good!)
We checked in and our room was fine - we had one on the 'land side' of the hotel and it was remarkably quiet.
We decided to eat at the bar later - but first of all we had our 'spa treatment' - a small problem in that our pre-booking hadn't been received (we had received confirmation of the booking!) Not a big issue we simply re-scheduled and had ours about an hour later. 
We decided to eat at the bar as we were late for our arranged meal in the city, it all seemed fine and we had a couple more drinks before retiring. Unfortunately for us we were both ill following our meal. We had not dated all that day so I can't put this down to anything else that we ate. We spent our two days in the room not feeling too great - we did have room service which was fine. So - all I can say is that - we had a great room - it was quiet and comfortable - staff are great - not too sure on the 'bar food' - maybe it was something from the day previous ? Im not sure really - give it a try - it's a little way out of the City centre and I couldn't really see a great deal of anything close by.",4,2016,09,29
119,Anniversary,"Really lovely and fun venue for our Anniversary. Room was very spacious, well equipped and impeccably clean and comfortable.  Brilliant food and service in the restaurant too. Will be back soon and definitely would recommend to everyone",4,2016,09,29
119,Bling on water,"Being a seasoned cruiser, I've long wanted to try this hotel out.  I've been passed it many times and stayed in other nearby hotels but never had the opportunity to try it out.

At last my chance to board.

The ship was clearly very opulent and still is.  It has a large central spiral staircase with a large chandelier, lots of brass and chrome on view, the corridor ceilings giving a reflective gold tint.  It's all a bit gaudy - not in an off-putting way, it's in no way untasteful, but it can feel a little brash and over the top.

Check in staff were a dream.  The rooms (we had dock view exec rooms) were large and lavish with a veranda, adjustable aircon, a large (50in?) LCD screen - king size bed and lots of storage (a surprise for an ex cruise  ship).  

A first for us was that the en-suite had underfloor heating, which was great when getting on of the shower.

Breakfast was a bit of a let down.  First the lifts indicate the best and worst time to go to breakfast in terms of traffic.  We had to be up early which got us in there in an apparently quiet time.  However we found it was anything but, being very busy.  It may be this was an anomaly but it was nonetheless disappointing there wasn't more space to ourselves.  After waiting for about three minutes they decided to put together a couple of tables just outside the main restaurant part.  That was good of them except that we then became a bit forgotten.  Took a while for someone to offer us tea or coffee rather than immediately like everyone else.  Then it took 10-15mins before they brought it.  It wasn't until a kindly waitress realised what was happening and took us under her wing.

The self service buffet was nice with a good selection.

Other problem was a bin in the room not being emptied and only having one bathrobe between the two of us.  These things happen and I measure a hotel not on mistakes but by how well they rectify them.  We told reception about both issues who wrote them down.  The rubbish was emptied however the second robe never materialised.

We did mention it at reception when we checked out, who did apologise and promised us a room upgrade on a future visit.  So that went some way to restoring our view.

I for one would like to go back, if only for the upgrade.  My wife says she's not really fussed.",4,2016,09,28
119,Anniversary stay with afternoon tea,"Stayed here in an executive room for our wedding anniversary and enjoyed champagne afternoon tea on the deck. Really enjoyed the experience - lovely room and the afternoon tea was spot on. Hearty breakfast the next morning as well. If you fancy staying somewhere a bit novel, this is a great choice. We plan on heading back again sometime soon, with the kids in tow!",5,2016,09,27
119,birthday treat,"Booked an executive suite with a balcony over looking the Thames.
What we got was a tired room , with a stain carpet ,( very dubious looking red stains ) balcony the size of a small sofa, over looking the pavement , 
Very disappointed",2,2016,09,27
119,Overall - very good but pity about the noisy air conditioning.,"A stay on the Sunborn is an amazing experience, BUT the stay was spoilt by the air con unit which, depite being switched off seemed to whirr away all night. Fortunately my partner and I both had earplugs, which we normally use to blot out noise from rooms above us. OK, so that's the negative out of the way.
So the stay itself: 
Firstly it should be said that coaches etc., will drop you off a 2 or 3 minute walk from the Yacht, this isn't a big problem, as the walk is level with no steps or slopes. Entering the yacht is done via a lift which takes you up to the reception area, exiting the lift into reception brings the first of many ""wows"" The staircases which leads to the restaurant level are spectacular and surrounds a very large chandelier. The check in staff, in common with every other staff member we came into contact with were very polite and welcoming. We stayed on a Sunday night as part of a short coach holiday to London and as such we were allocated ""Classic"" cabins on the side facing the dock, but we still had a view and not, as we'd expected the dock wall! 
The Classic cabins are of a high standard, with wooden flooring in the room and a tiled floor in the bathroom. There was a real feel of quality even in what are the cheapest rooms. One feature which we liked was an in room Tablet, which as well as giving loads of information about the yacht and its services and amenities could be used to check public transport timetables, etc., This same tablet has 2 or 3 kids games on it, to keep the little ones occupied. There is a minibar in the room, but all it contains is two bottles of water. Tea and coffee making facilities (with a coffee machine) are available in the room, We found the bed comfortable with good pillows. The room also contained an iron and ironing board, adequate hanging and drawer space. One thing we found strange was that there was a nice glass topped coffee table in the room - and ONE armchair for a room that is clearly set up for TWO people? Had we been staying for more than one night we would have requested another chair.  The bathroom has a shower - no bath and has a hairdryer. Complimentary toiletries and good quality towels are provided. As mentioned earlier access to reception is by lift, these same lifts take you to your floor for your room and of course to exit the yacht. We ate breakfast in the restaurant as it was included in our package. The restaurant is surprisingly small for the size of the yacht, but we didn't have a problem getting seated. The breakfast itself is a buffet affair with loads of choices from continental to full English. Tea and coffee is delivered to your table. 
The yacht is a short distance from London City Airport and the flight path comes right over the top of it. We never heard any noise from the planes in our cabin. 
Victoria Dock (where the yacht is situated) is an up and coming area with loads of restaurants within a couple of minutes walk. The Excel centre is ""on the doorstep"" The Cable car across the Thames to the O2 arena is also a short walk away, we had hoped to get it across the river, but there was a long queue for it and we were short of time. The location of the Sunborn isn't ideal if one plans to travel into Central London, there are no direct transport links to the centre. Also, there are no parking facilities associated with the yacht - there is a multi storey car park at The Excel, and one for the Victoria Dock itself, but both of these are expensive. 
For a little touch of luxury, I can thoroughly recommend The Sunborn.",4,2016,09,27
119,Anniversary Treat,"Booked this as a anniversary treat, the experience was generally nice (mainly because it was on a yacht) but was disappointed for a few small things. There were giant stains on the carpet, clearly visible as soon as you walk in, the tablet for room services  wasn't use able because it wasn't charged, I would have expected a bathtub for the price but there wasn't one, chipped cup. Just the general quality and attention to detail was lacking.",3,2016,09,26
119,Good exoerience,"Nice experience. Good location near theO2 but not suitable for central London.
Spacious rooms. Nice staff. I needed an HDMI cable to connect my MacBook to the TV but they didn't have any, I think it's better if they have a couple of cables for emergencies like this it'll give the customer a good impression about the hotel.",3,2016,09,26
119,Hubbys birthday,Had a lovely night staying at the sunborn for my hubbys birthday! The staff were friendly and very helpful and we even got chocolates and a letter in our room to wish him happy birthday! The bed was very comfy and the curtains kept the early morning sun out perfectly! We had cocktails in the evening on the deck and the service was fab and have to say the mojhito I have ever had (was not in the menu but requested and they delivered. Fab!!) my only negative I would say is that there was a bit of a dodgy odour coming from our bathroom and there were some stains on the carpet which you would not expect from a hotel of this price and standard!! Other than that we would definately visit again!,4,2016,09,25
119,Sunborn Yaught ,Was unimpressed room was tired looking scruffy carpets no bath £300 then we HD lunch evening meal and breakfast another £350.. the only impressive thing was the staircase 1 bar 1 restaurant overpriced ,2,2016,09,25
119,Excellent hotel,"We stayed on board sunborn for 2 nites on arrival I thought wow as entered reception that staircase . Timea our receptionist was fantastic made things really special  for us. The room was exceptional really large with balcony overlooking dock. Room was very  clean . Everybody on board made us feel very welcome  and special.  Will be going again soon . Only niggle for me and probably  petty to some there was not enough  tea and coffee in room , but the location was superb plenty restaurants and bars locally so easy to get to by public transport.  But the best bit was seeing  sunborn  at night all lit up . Would recommend  to any one ",5,2016,09,25
119,luxury experience,"The room was massive, big enough for a family. But breakfast and Spa facilities should be included in price. We couldn't access the spa as out of service but only notified when asked at arrival. Staff advised therevwas no provision for veggie sausages, however thank you to Lency for checking with the chef  and making my special veggie birthday breakfast, it was lovely and going the excel mile deserves recognistion.",4,2016,09,25
119,Fantastic experience ,"Lovely hotel on a yacht.
 Although I didn't feel like i was sleeping on a yacht.
Fantastic view of the docklands and the O2 from the back of the yacht where the bar is. 
The sunborn looks prettier at night. 
Definitely upgrade to sea view.
Would recommend and was a very nice experience. ",5,2016,09,25
119,Honeymoon in London,"Finished our honeymoon with a 2-night stay aboard the Sunborn Luxury Yacht in London. Everything about the stay is unique, from the lifts to come aboard, to the state room style accommodation. We had a great room with balcony and view along the water. Only downside was cost of any food or beverages - we chose to eat in different locations in London, including breakfast. We did have a drink at the bar prior to departing (one wine and one lemonade) and it was verging on extortionate! That aside, our stay was a memorable way to finish our honeymoon and we would recommend if you are looking for a unique accommodation option in London town.",4,2016,09,25
119,Lovely stay,"Our room was lovely so quiet and peaceful, I was a bit worried about being able to hear the planes landing and taking off, but could not hear a thing at night. The breakfast was of good quality with plenty of choices, easy journey into the centre of London on the DLR then tube. Would definitely stay again if we are ever in London.",4,2016,09,24
119,Fab overnight luxury stay,"My best friend & I spent a wonderful night on this amazing yacht for my 40th. What a treat. Brilliant location for the O2 & just a short tube ride from central London. Room goegeous & comfortable, staff attentive & made us feel so welcome. Relaxing stay plus delicious breakfast. Can't wait to go back! We went on the Emirates Cable Car which was an amazing experience & at night the surrounding area lit up is magical & just blew us away. Fab memories forever! We didn't eat on the Sunborn but were informed by other passengers it was lovely.",5,2016,09,23
119,Amazing place with fantastic views of London,"Would I go again? Absolutely 

We didn't stay at the hotel but went for a drink in the bar.  From the dock side you get the lift down to reception, which is also stunning and the bar is just behind the reception. 

We sat outside as the view over Canary Wharf and the 02 was stunning.  

Loved it so much we stopped for a 2nd bottle of wine and decided to order food.  We didnt use the restaurant just had the bar food.

Had the burger with blue cheese and wow...it was one of the tastiest burger I have had in a long time.

The staff are great, friendly and excellent service. 

I can't wait to go back ",5,2016,09,23
119,Perfect for early LCY departure,"We found this hotel on booking.com whilst looking for a hotel near London City airport as we had a 6:40am flight and thought it would be a bit different

The boat is very impressive on arrival, you get a lift down to the lobby where you check in and the loopy with sweeping staircase and chandelier is also impressive.

The room we had was a good size and had a view out across the Thames. The room was clean, bed comfy, temperature good and bathroom fine (I think It may have heated floors?  As seemed really warm), and has molten brown complimentary goods.

We had room service - Caesar salad and pizza - which was below average and would not recommend

We otherwise fully enjoyed our stay and would recommend and would like to come back with the kids 

Good price for £115 for the night",4,2016,09,23
119,Great stay,This hotel was beautiful.  Very clean. The double Thames view room was huge and pleasant. The bar area was cosy and the restaurant was amazing with great food.  Loved it would return and recommend.across the river from 02 and many restaurants ,5,2016,09,22
119,Amazing location and excellent staff,The staff were very welcoming and friendly. They all took the time to explain things and made you feel valued. The boat was beautiful with great rooms and a taste of luxury. I will definitely return as it was brilliant value for money.,5,2016,09,21
119,Amazing Yacht hotel,"We stayed here for my birthday, loved it, what a beautiful yacht to stay on, the cabin,  the staff,  and the food, amazing. It's a little expensive for drinks, but hay it was my birthday. My family came aboard to join us for the evening meal and we were not disappointed it's was lovely. What I stay again, yes in a heartbeat. And the weather was fantastic.",5,2016,09,20
119,Afternoon tea on the deck was lovely,"Fabulous afternoon spent on the deck eating scones and drinking tea. Lovely tranquil atmosphere, decent food, and generous tea refills. Thankyou especially to Lazlo who made our experience so enjoyable, even though he didn't get my jokes.",5,2016,09,19
119,50th wedding anniversary,"stopped on 10th September . all the amenities first class, dinner at night delicious
reception staff were great. a special thank you to Sandra for taking the photo's and suppling the captains hat. The room had a balcony overlooking the dock same floor as the restaurant which was handy",5,2016,09,19
119,Let the boat out - its worth it!!,"We took our son there as a surprise for his 21st birthday. Such grandeur is normally twice the price (we paid £320 for 2 rooms one evening) and due to the new O2 cable car and Thames ferry service anywhere in London is only minutes away - and much cheaper and relaxed than cabs or ubers. Its great for special occasions and the hotel ensured us a window table for a wonderful birthday breakfast. The feel of the hotel and room is in-keeping with luxury cruising. Drinks are expensive but it is London and it is luxurious so a price worth paying. Looking forward to our next ""special occasion"" Probably best to book when there are no shows on at Excel. ",5,2016,09,19
119,Romantic anniversary night,"My partner booked the Romantic package to celebrate our first anniversary together. 
It was a surprise and a beautiful one at that. 
The venue was exquisite, the hotel entrance has a beautiful chandelier in the middle of two winding staircases which lead to the dining room. 
The room was beautifully designed with tea/coffee making facilities, a mini-fridge and T.V.
There was a heart shape on the bed made of real rose petals and 2 swans made from towels sat near the heart. 
Dinner was delicious, the food and service was amazing. 
Nothing was too much trouble",5,2016,09,18
119,Sanctuary in London,This is the second time we have stayed at the Sunborn. We had a lovely suite with a balcony overlooking the dock. Very spacious for my husband and myself and our 2 Granddaughters. The service was good as was the food. Very accommodating staff. A perfect base to escape after a day in the city.  Even better in the warm weather when we were fortunate to breakfast outside on the deck.   All in all a lovely relaxing stay. Definitely recommend.,5,2016,09,17
119,Absolutely beautiful ,"Booked an overnight stay at the Sunborn for a birthday treat for my partner, I wanted a trip to London and was looking for something a bit out of the ordinary and I thought this place looked promising. We were not disappointed, it is absolutely lovely. 

On arrival we were impressed by the stunning reception area and the charming and helpful staff (crew??) who showed us to a beautifully appointed (state?) room. It was spacious, stylish, superbly fitted out and comfortable, we wanted for nothing and the bed was without exception, the most comfortable I have ever slept in, imagine being enveloped in a cloud......

We ate out in the evening but enjoyed some beautifully prepared and delicious cocktails out on the deck which has spectacular views, we also tucked into a great breakfast in the lovely restaurant before checking out.
 
Having seen a lot of planes flying low overhead due to the proximity of the airport I was concerned that we may be disturbed by noise, I needn't have been, it was the most quiet and peaceful room I've ever stayed in anywhere, we did not hear a sound.

The reception staff recommended we try the Emirates cable car and a river taxi as an alternative way to the city centre which we we tried and it was wonderful, on the whole, the Sunborn experience was flawless, I can't wait to return.",5,2016,09,17
119,Afternoon on the Sunborn London,"I celebrated my birthday on the Sunborn yacht hotel London where I had the most amazing time , sitting on deck enjoying the beautiful weather could be compared to any other destination in the world.  The staff were welcoming and hospitable, the atmosphere and decor impressionable . 
Will certainly be visiting again thank you for the wonderful experience .",5,2016,09,14
119,Fancy something different,"The sunborn hotel stay was awesome , sitting out on deck with a glass of wine looking over the Thames . Rooms were roomy and clean and really quiet ( was surprised as it was fully booked ) . Breakfast was great , everything one would want and service first class.",4,2016,09,14
119,Wedding anniversary ,Having enjoyed afternoon tea here we decided to stay for our second wedding anniversary. I really like the hotel location  it's away from all the tourist hustle and bustle but close enough if you want to get in the mix of it. The room was clean and modern. The hotel had a power cut that night which led to very annoyed guests who took it out on the staff. Their behaviour was embarrassing. The power cut didn't affect us and we enjoyed a complementary drink in the bar while we waited. When life gives you lemons make a G&T! ,4,2016,09,14
119,Want something different but still classy?,Stayed overnight on this beautiful yacht. We were on deck one but had a view across the dock. The view from the rear towards the shard was absolutely beautiful in the early morning. From here you can see all the famous landmarks.,5,2016,09,14
119,Short stay,"The Sunborn is close to unique, a converted luxury yacht, and the hotel has managed to retain the opulence of it's past. Great staff, and fantastic food, and considering the quality and location not overpriced. 
My only criticism of the stay was when I signed to bar bill there was the usual add a gratuity option, so I added a tip, only to discover that there's a mandatory 12.5% service charge as well.",4,2016,09,13
119,A real treat,"We asked if it was possible to upgrade from our dock view room, this was done quickly & efficiently even though there were a lot of people checking in at the same time.
Our room was very luxurious with everything we could possibly need including a coffee pod machine. It was nice to have a balcony even if it was very small.
Great dinner & breakfast.",5,2016,09,13
119,Excellent in very way,"We stayed on the sunborn Yacht whilst on a tour of London.  The accommodation, breakfast & service were excellent.  Unfortunately the restaurant was fully booked for our stay & we were advised to eat at adjacent places.  Sadly they were not of a similar standard to the Sunborn: a Chinese & an Indian restaurant were fine of their type. There is also not a lot to do in that particular dockland so although superb in itself the location lets it down a little.",5,2016,09,13
119,Overnight on business," Very impressive accommodation, grand entrance well maintained, staff did seem very interested but like robots, room was not what we booked but looked clean and tidy very much an upmarket cabin on a ship. 
But it stopped there, the bed is the worst I have ever slept on and I have stayed in some poor hotels but this takes the biscuit,I never got a good night sleep it fell to bits at one stage, also No windows that could open had to have air con on all night keeping me awake, we did get it as a deal so maybe that was why but very disappointed.",3,2016,09,13
119,Birthday ,"Great time on the boat , only thing that disappointed was the fact the picture showed a casino but they are on their 5 star boats and this one is 4 star .... But we up graded the room for £40 to be waterside which entitled us to 20% off all food and drinks purchased . The food was fantastic the staff were very friendly but not in your face ... Would defiantly go back .... Btw if you don't like heights do not get off the train at Greenwich because the cable car is the only way across 😬😬",4,2016,09,12
119,Sheer luxury,"We had a wonderful stay at the sunburn yacht hotel in an executive dock view room.  Very luxurious and the evening meal was exceptional.  All staff were very friendly and helpful.  We can recommend the cocktails also, scrumptious!!! ",5,2016,09,11
119,Diserpointed ,"My wife booked us a room for our stay over in London we arrived early after a terrible time finding it as the website we used informed us that the nearest station was Prince Albert and it defiantly  isn't it's the excel so we had a long walk back on ourselfs  when we arrived we where informed checkin was 3pm so we needed to wait 40 minutes so sat in the bar had a few drinks (watch out for the service charge 12.5%) on the bills as standard.
Managed to check in behind what looked like a stag do and our room was port side 1003 the room was lovely shower no bath and the view was a little brick wall and the rubbish floating in the water between the boat and dock.
Decided to go out for dinner and returned back about 10pm settled down for a nights sleep now the problem is I think our room was below the bar or works area because all night all you could hear was people walking  or moving above and it went on till about 12.30 1pm time which kept waking me up its defiantly people walking about you can hear a thudding sound.
Again in the morning about 6am was awoke by the same noise moving about above us, went for breakfast at 8.40am as we payed extra to eat, there was four tables in the Restarant it looked stunning well set out, staff sat us straight away we ordered one tea and one coffee then the wait began we had fresh juice, (no hot drinks) we had cereal (no hot drinks) asked a member of staff they said no problem they will get it, had a hot full English (still no drinks) asked again 
A tea and a coffee arrived as we had finished our breakfast 30 minutes after we had sat, we wouldn't of minded but there was only 4 other tables in the Restarant with us and the staff where ample with managers and servers so in our view a very poor breakfast service.

When my wife told me we where staying I honestly thought the service and experience  would of been a lot better then what we received for the price they want and with all the competition in London I think they need to improve there game to keep up.

119,Rude receptionist,"We visited the Sunborn Hotel on Friday 26th August to celebrate my birthday and engagement. We had read on this site that all groupon deal rooms are allocated dock side but had also read that you can upgrade for £20 to a river view so upon arrival we requested this.  We were then informed that it would cost £40!! When I challenge the gentleman he became very put out and asked me to prove it and show him where it was written. He was not very helpful and was very grumpy when I said we would stay with the original room as we felt that £40 was extortionate ( we ended up dock side lower floor looking at a concrete wall) I came back on this site and found a reply from the Front House Manager explaining that Groupon customers can upgrade for £20 so took this back to reception to discuss the matter.  I spoke to a lovely lady who was very apologetic but then the obnoxious man came and stuck his nose into our conversation and said where is the proof, give me your phone then grabbed it. He then went on to say that was then and today it's £40. He implied that was what Groupon customers were charged!!  I explained that he was completely ruining our stay  and that I found him very aggressive and he was not bothered. We couldn't wait to leave and go home.  I did speak the the Manager on checking out and he was very apologetic and gave us a bottle of Champagne which was very kind but I would have rather just been met with more respect upon arrival. If you care about your customers they will recommend and return.  Unfortunately I will not be doing either.",2,2016,09,11
119,"Beautiful Hotel, very impressive.","My husband and I stayed at the Sunborn Hotel for his birthday, booked it through trip advisor. We got of the DLR at Royal Victoria and walked along the river. Custom house station is easier and closest. The yacht was very impressive and is moored in a nice area. We arrived around 4pm to check in. Still a few people checking in. A little busy due to the boxing at O2.
When we did check in we were booked a  executive room which was beautiful and  very spacious, we were land view which was still lovely views. We were on the 2nd floor. The only thing is you can hear people walking above which I think was children. 
 The room was clean with plenty of storage. The fridge had 2 free bottles of water and a coffee machine. The bathroom was a decent size, the shower was big enough for 2 people, the bathroom comes with Molton Brown products. 
We watched the football in the local bar Fox's. We didn't stay for our evening meal as we had found restaurant close on tripadvisor.
There are lots of different restaurants around the area plus a Tesco Extra & Nisa which is great and open until 12pm. 
 The Sunborn Hotel is in a great location to go on the cable car over the Thames which we did and also if you were visiting the O2. Would highly recommend especially for occasions. ",4,2016,09,11
119,Great place to stay!,"We choose this hotel due to it's location near to the excel centre as we were attending Star Wars Celebration.  We had stayed here before and it's a great base whether your going to the excel centre or to the O2, or indeed if your visiting Central London itself.  The staff were very friendly upon check in and our room was river facing, so we had great views over the river from our balcony.  We stayed with our son who was six and he really enjoyed staying on a boat and felt extra special as the sofa bed faced the TV in the room, so he felt he had a TV all for himself!  He also got a colouring in pack on arrival and the staff really took the time to make him feel special throughout our stay.  The restaurant was fully booked, so it's worth booking a table prior to your stay, but we had snacks in the bar out on the deck which was great and a nice experience.   We all got a good night sleep, the beds were really comfy and the room was quiet.  We had breakfast included, although its not too much to add.  There was a great selection, so worthwhile having on board. Overall another great stay at the Sunborn.",5,2016,09,11
119,Singapore sling,"It's a great relaxed yet accessible location in a fantastic setting. Good sized rooms, very clean. Friendly helpful staff and the bar staff (Jay, Isabel, Alex & Vicky) made us feel very welcome with the best Singapore Slings. Would definitely stay here again 😃",5,2016,09,10
119,Great place to stay,"My husband and I stayed at the Sunborn last night, booked it through Secret Escapes so got it at a reasonable price too. We travelled to London on the train and got the tube from Kings Cross to the Excel, which was really easy. The yacht looks really impressive on arrival and is moored in a nice area. We arrived early, well before check in but they allowed us to leave our case whilst we went out exploring. When we did check in we were booked in an executive room which was lovely, very spacious and a nice big bed. The room was clean with plenty of storage. There were 2 free bottles of water in the mini bar and a coffee machine. The bathroom was a decent size, the shower was big enough for 2 people. Watch out for the step up into the bathroom, I stubbed a toe and it's now very bruised and sore. We didn't stay for our evening meal as we had found a tapas restaurant close by that we wanted to try. There are lots of different restaurants around the area plus a Tesco Extra which is great if you want to purchase some alcohol for your room!!! We did have a drink in the yacht bar after our meal which was expensive, it cost £32 for 3 vodka and sodas.  We had breakfast this morning, there was plenty to choose from, full English breakfast, cereals, toast etc. We were shown to a table for 2 and ordered coffee which was very slow in coming, we had to remind them but overall a lovely breakfast. As I said earlier we booked our stay with Secret Escapes so got the room at a discounted rate, I don't think I would have paid the full price, it is expensive. Really nice to stay somewhere a bit different.  The yacht is in a great location to go on the cable car over the Thames which we did and also if you were visiting the O2. We did the walk over the O2 which was amazing.  ",4,2016,09,10
119,Amazing 😍😍,"I visited last night with my partner, it was the best hotel I've been to in London the spa treatments were great it's so clean staff were very welcoming the food was lovely especially the breakfast 5stars ",5,2016,09,10
119,Fabulous and different ,"We booked the Sunborn via a Secret Escapes deal months in advance. It was an anniversary celebration, so we treated ourselves.
The recommended car park was only a 5-minute walk away and check-in fast and easy.
We had upgraded to a river view room on the 4th floor and glad we did. The view from our room was fabulous, looking out towards the O2 and Canary Wharf.
The room itself was attractive and well appointed and the bed one of the most comfortable we have ever experienced in a hotel.
After settling in and having a drink 😆 we took a stroll along the dockside to the nearby Emirates Cable Car. This takes you across the dock to the O2, with fantastic views of the surrounding area. At a height of nearly 300ft, I was a little unnerved, but still thoroughly enjoyed it.
Anyway, back to the hotel, via a detour to a dockside bar for another drink, we chilled for a while until it was time for dinner. The main restaurant was on the same floor, so nice and convenient. Be warned, though, that the restaurant is expensive and, in my opinion, could offer more choices. So, if that bothers you, there are other restaurants nearby. But, for us, the convenience outweighed this and the food was good.
The service, which I know has been criticised in some reviews, was absolutely fine.
All in all, a highly enjoyable visit and one which topped off our anniversary celebrations perfectly.",4,2016,09,10
119,Anniversary Present,"Our children bought us a night on the Sunborne with dinner and breakfast as an anniversary present.  The yacht really has the ""wow"" factor when you step onboard. Our room was fabulous, really large with a balcony.  It was a really hot, humid night in London and thanks to the air conditioning we had the best night sleep.

I had not booked the restaurant in advance so we could not get a table until 9.30. Dinner was okay, not a lot of choice and very small portions so you may need  to order side dishes.

It was a lovely evening so after dinner we sat on the deck and had a drink. The bar is very expensive.

We were very lucky to be able to have breakfast on the deck the next morning.  The cold selection was very good.  But I was very disappointed that there was not a, cooked to order, Full English Breakfast.  In other countries it is a bonus that they have pre cooked hot breakfast items but in England you expect a full English Breakfast!  The eggs were rubbery, the black pudding like chalk and the bacon was like a slice of cardboard.  Nothing was hot only lukewarm.  For a ""luxury"" hotel (as advertised) I would expect a much better restaurant.",4,2016,09,10
119,Great stay again.,"Room was lovely as usual and staff where all very polite. However on this occassion Breakfast was a let down. Bacon was on the turn. black pudding dryest ive ever tasted and toms and mushrooms way to over seasoned. But i certainly wont be letting it stop me visiting again as it is a awesome Hotel , which we frequently recomend to others.",4,2016,09,09
119,Total luxury from start to finish and never wanted it to finish,"It was a treat for my family which consisted of daughter, son in law, two adult grandsons and husband to celebrate an important anniversary.  The were not aware where we were going it was all a surprise and I have to say what a surprise.  I was delighted with my first impression as the yacht sat quietly on the Royal Victoria Dock for everyone to see.  People were coming around the corner from hotels etc. just to gaze at her beauty.  We boarded and checked in, welcome was very impressive, we had already had a telephone call in the morning to remind us our dinner booking was for 8 pm in the Land End Restaurant.  We checked into our cabin, big is an understatement, we had a lounge with the window almost the whole width of the cabin and a super queen bed where you could get lost!
We changed for dinner, and made our way to the bar for pre-dinner drinks.  Their range of cocktails was excellent and we sampled a few before making our way to the dining room where from any table you would be able to look out over the water to the twinkling lights of  that apart of London.  Very impressive.  The food was excellent and beautifully presented, attention to detail and attention to the diners was of the best.  Nothing was too much trouble.  Our nights sleep was peaceful and we had decided breakfast at 10 am this was again in the same dining room, although there are several private rooms for private parties, and your choice was from a continental breakfast to a full English.  A buffet style this time but tea or coffee was served directly to your table.  All bills for meals already have a gratuity added and if you were not satisfied you can ask for it to be removed.
A really enjoyable and luxurious time with everyone really happy having had a very pleasant time during their stay.",5,2016,09,09
119,Hidden Gem,"Best hotel I've ever had in London for £153. Friendly staff, very large cabins fully knitted out with all the essential and fast wi-fi. Having a snack on the sundeck with a bottle of wine on a hot September afternoon watching the open water swimmers and the Emirates cable car to the O2 (see separate review) was so tranquil. Drove up from Essex and parked in the Excel secure car park which is only 100yds away for £15 per day - a bargain. Travelled into the city for a day on the underground which is only 200yds away made it a pleasant un-rushed stay and will definitely be going back. Can understand why others rated it so highly.",5,2016,09,08
119,Excellent experience ,"Excellent experience staff polite and friendly and rooms spacious and comfortable, bar prices slightly pricey but then I'm northern so not used to paying London prices. Overall a really enjoyable stay and I would highly recommend a visit.",4,2016,09,07
119,A Taste of Luxury!,"We had visited the Sunborn for cocktails at Christmas time and been so impressed with the concept we promised ourselves a stay at some point. We went to visit our son last weekend so decided to give the Sunborn a go. We were not disappointed. What a wonderful welcome from the staff! Our room faced out over the water and really did feel like we were on an ocean going yacht! Everything you could ask for was available on board. Super views across the water to Docklands, exquisite at night with a drink in hand out on deck. Breakfast was excellent. Our only disappointment was on waking in the morning we were still in London and not moored up in the Mediterranean!",5,2016,09,07
119,Fab! ,"Had a fabulous time at the Sunborn London. Had trouble finding it at first and this made us late for checking in. We had a table booked in the restaurant and we only arrive at the hotel 5 minutes before the reservation as the taxi driver took us to the wrong place. Anyway although the hotel couldn't change the time of the reservation as the restaurant was fully book they didn't mind us bring late and was very understanding. The meal was beautiful, the service was good and the staff are friendly. We had my 6 year old son with us and he loved it on the yacht. Great experience for a family trip. Lovely rooms or should I say cabins with Molton brown toiletries, bathrobes and slippers in the cabins. Tea and coffee making facilities and a fridge in the cabin. Tasty breakfast although the staff had to keep filling it up all the time as only a small area which did mean you had to wait at times. However it was nice and enjoyable. I will be returning. ",5,2016,09,05
119,ANNIVERSARY TREAT!,"Stayed on The Sunborn for one night in an Executive Riverview room for our Wedding Anniversary having booked a Romantic package direct with the hotel.....
Warm welcome on arrival and our first impressions were good.....

Our room 4030 was very large with a small balcony. The bed had been beautifully decorated with rose petals and towel art swans.....the bathrooms are very small with a shower, loo and hand basin....fine for a one night stay but I'd find it cramped for longer.....also the door to the bathroom is very stiff.....not good if you're elderly.....on closer inspection, like other reviewers we had stained carpets in our room and one of our hand towels had a huge hole in it....not what you expect in a hotel of this standard!!.....
The rooms are well equipped with tea/coffee making facilities, iron, safe, robe and slippers.....there is a tablet giving you all the hotel info which is easy to use.....

The staff were all very friendly and obliging both in the bar and the restaurant.....

Our package included a three course dinner and breakfast.....
Dinner was of a very poor standard....lamb dish seemed boiled with slimy fat all round it which hadn't been browned off....yuk!....
The desserts were also very average and tasteless.....
Decor wise:- more stained carpets!
I pointed these issues out to the front of house staff when we left the restaurant and she said she'd pass my comments onto the chef......
The breakfast was lovely with a good choice of both cooked and continental food on offer.....one gip here though was we were offered tea and coffee when we sat down but there was no explanation as to what we had to do regarding the buffet breakfast....and no offer to cook anything special I.e omelette or poached eggs!....and no offer to refill our pots of tea.....VERY POOR FOR A HOTEL OF THIS STANDARD!!....

On the whole we enjoyed our night on the yacht.....there just seems to be a few underlying issues that if rectified would make it a much better experience.....
1) New carpets everywhere 
2) Updated bathrooms
3) Newspapers offered in the morning 
3) A new chef in the kitchen
4) Retraining of staff in breakfast restaurant

I would stay here again but probably only on a GroupOn offer as I didn't think it was worth the £370 we paid.....

119,Lovely experience ,"We stayed at sunborn London on the 2/9/16 to celebrate our 16th wedding anniversary. The room was beautifully decorated just like on their website. The staff were very nice and friendly. The food was small portions but surprisingly very filling and delicious. My husband and I had a lovely experience and would definitely go back there again. I would highly recommend it to my family and friends. 
Firdowsa",5,2016,09,04
119,Expensive,"First visited this hotel a few years ago when it first opened it was a really good experience .Beware when going back to places you enjoyed .This time there was no proper wine glasses in the room I suppose they get stolen .The fitments are all getting marked and there was coffee stains over the carpet and at these prices you expect to be spotless The breakfast was very good but when you ask for something different it was hard to make yourself understood. We did not eat or drink in the hotel as we found it a bit pricey so I can not pass comment but people who did said it was okay.There are better hotels at these prices ,but if you want to try sleeping on a yacht on the river  then give it a try.",3,2016,09,04
119,Overrated ,"So looking forward to lunch here, food and service were ok but the overall experience did not live up to expectations.

Parking in Excel car park excessively expensive and a fair way to walk to venue .

You could find better !",3,2016,09,03
119,Accommodation good service in restaurant awful,"We enjoyed the views across the water from our suite and the cleanliness of the yacht. The service in the restaurant was awful and quite  few of the guests were, like ourselves, complaining, the bar service in the evening was very very slow. obviously not enough staff. Do not expect a large meal it was very small portions. please be prepared to pay eyewatering prices for drink including water. to finish our day/overnight stay  my husband has a piece of metal in his fried egg at breakfast!",3,2016,09,03
119,Not worth the money! Not a 5 star.,"I stayed here on Thursday and to be 100% honest, it was not what the pictures make it out to be. It is very deceiving. It looks very tired, and noticed a very used smell. We slept right outside the door which everyone uses and all we heard from 5:30am onwards was banging and talking. The lift was not working and my dad cannot walk up the stairs so made it very difficult and the staff didn't seem like they cared. I didn't even eat at breakfast as the range of food they had was very small. The only good part was the view outside if you stay in a room with a balcony. Doesn't deserve its 5* not sure who rates it that! Not going back.",2,2016,09,03
119,A Unique Experience,"Enjoyed our stay aboard the Sunborn although there are some improvements to be made.
We thoroughly enjoyed the views and the rooms are very spacious considering it's a boat.
All the staff are efficient but ( due to language difficulties ) appeared brash and had an answer back when querying something. Customer training needed we think.
Breakfast was very good but slow service and very expensive.
If you fancy a different hotel experience in London it can be recommended.",4,2016,09,03
119,Super stay,"We arrived early, checked in then left suitcase until our room was ready. We explored the area, had lunch then came back and sat in the sun on the deck, people watching. Our room was super, spotlessly clean, plenty of room and very comfortable. Dinner was very good with an excellent view. After dinner we went into the bar which had the same view, we loved watching the cable cars when they were lit up in the dark. Would we go again? Yes we would",5,2016,09,03
119,Outstanding ,"Absolutely outstanding, thank you so much to Victor for making our stay so perfect. We are returning customers and this is out third stay. Your customer service was definitely above and beyond. Breakfast was exceptional. See you again soon. ",5,2016,09,03
119,Great hotel ,"We went on a deal with booking.com where I got the best deal half price .room was amazing really big although the double bed was two singles pushed together . 
Hotel looks fantastic from the outside and was easy to find I did the route from London kings cross my husband did the route is his car he parked At the Royal Victoria car park which is £15 for 24 hours and is located 5 min from the yacht I've seen reviews saying the car park is unsafe however we have a Porsche and it was fine ..
The food was extremely expensive but to be expected on this type of hotel . 
We went to the o2 via cable cars 7 each lots of better places to eat .
They took my room money twice and I have to wait five days for it to go back in which was a shame
Overall A lovely concept and would return 
",5,2016,09,03
119,Wonderful Stay,"We stayed on the Sunborn for our Anniversay and we had a great time. The Yacht is kept spotlessly clean and the staff are very friendly and efficient. We booked an Executive room with river view which had a small balcony. Our room was very spacious and very well furnished, and we enjoyed siiting on the balcony in the sun. We ate in the restaurant to celebrate our Anniversay and the food from the a la carte  menu and service was amazing.",5,2016,09,03
119,Love this place but they weren't on their game for this visit!,"We have stayed at the Sunborn before and absolutely loved it (see previous review).  So when a Groupon deal appeared for an overnighter the was roughly in the middle of my wife and my 50th birthday, we jumped at the chance.

We arrived excited and for a small charge upgraded to the better side of the boat & made sure they realised that it was a celebration.  We went to the restaurant and it went a little down hill.  We waited for quite a while before our orders were taken.  Our drinks arrived and then we sat there for about 30 mins.  We mentioned twice to the waiter that we hadn't had our bread to no avail.  The Head Waiter brought our starters out and realised the mistake, so quickly gave us our bread. But obviously our waiter hadn't realised and brought our starters out again about 2 minutes after our bread had arrived.

The meal carried on - food good, if service a little sluggish still.  We ordered a cheese board to share as our dessert, which duly arrived.  It was at this point I happened to notice the Maitre d looking concerned in our direction as she was talking to the Head Waiter. So after we had finished our cheese, a slate with Happy Birthday written in sauce on it, two macaroons and 2 chocolate truffles (4 of which were already in our bedroom).  It wasn't really what we wanted after having a savoury dessert.  

It was all just a bit average for somewhere aiming at high-end cuisine.  (There had already been a bit of a scene with another set of diners).  We didn't want to cause a big hoo-ha but didn't leave a tip and wrote on the slip, politely, our reason why.

Afterwards the Maitre d and the Head Waiter spoke to us and reduced our bill gave us a free bottle of champagne by way of apology.  The reason given was that they were very busy in high season, especially with the Groupon deals.  However, this isn't the point, they should be geared to deal with this as a quality restaurant.  I would rather pay in full and receive quality service.  And, really, it would have been a better (and cheaper) touch to offer each of us a free glass of champagne for our 50th!

Again, on checking out, apologies were made and service charges waived.  

We will be back but please get things right!!",3,2016,09,02
119,Afternoon tea,"My friend booked us and her son to have afternoon tea on the sunborn, when we arrived we were the only ones and were given the choice where to sit it was an extremely hot day we were going to sit outside but there was no umbrellas to keep us shaded so we decided to sit inside by the door we had a lovely view of the river. We were greeted by a very nice lady who explained all the lovely teas on offer. The whole experience was very nice I really enjoyed it and the yacht is absolutely beautiful definitely will be back. ",4,2016,09,02
119,Not what I expected. ,"Saw this super yatch on line and it looked like the perfect getaway for a night or two. After my research and looking on trip advisor I thought it would be a perfect place for us. Not easy to find but I suggest parking in the Excel car park £15 for 24hours and then a minute walk away. It looks amazing! Check in very quick and the two ladies on reception were lovely and could not do enough for you. Our room keys would not work in the lift and after two lots of room keys and no luck we gave up. We had an executive room on the 2nd floor one down from reception which is on the 3rd. Somewhat very disappointed. Not the wow factor we expected. Carpets stained all over, toilet like a caravan porta loo. Just run down. Not the £230 I paid by a long shot. Mini bar empty apart from a complimentary small bottle of water each. 
We paid for breakfast on the 4th floor which is all buffet. Not labelled etc milk full fat or semi, bread not labelled so you don't really know what is what. At £20 per person a let down and very boring and sparse. There is a 24 Tesco Express a minute away very small and does not stock a lot. To eat we ventured out but the only place we liked the look of was the Docklands and the food was superb but pricey and cocktails £9 each but well worth it. Staff friendly and made the meal. My daughter had room service at 11.30pm, the pizza was amazing but small enough for one but we then ordered a sandwich which took 45minutes and we then received a call saying it was being prepared as they were busy! I don't believe at 12.45pm that this was the case.
So sum the whole stay up very expensive, but the quirkiness of being on a yatch and river view is great. Would I pay again NO! 
Just a mention to Jay and Isq on the bar who made the cocktails. They were perfect. Very friendly staff.  ",2,2016,09,02
119,Wonderful overnight treat!,"We booked an overnight stay to celebrate our 10th wedding anniversary. Great location, quite peaceful, in fact, but with lots of excellent sights and restaurants nearby. We caught the Emirates cable car across to the dock and arrived around 3pm. There was a queue to check-in, as the computer system had crashed, but everyone waiting was given a free glass of champagne and a voucher for a further glass of champagne as compensation for having to wait longer than expected. The reception staff were very helpful and apologetic. The interior of the hotel is lovely, especially the crystal chandelier and spiral staircase, and our executive room was gorgeous- classic, elegant but with all the mod-cons such as an in-room tablet. Food in the Lands End restaurant is gourmet therefore quite expensive, but the dishes we ordered were fantastic. My husband had the saddle of lamb and I had the wild mushroom and welsh rarebit gratin with duck poached egg. Cooked to perfection! The view is also amazing, particularly at night when everything is illuminated. We had fine weather, so were able to sit outside the bar on deck with a drink and enjoy the atmosphere and surroundings. Service was very good and breakfast the next day was excellent too. Overall, we had a lovely, romantic, relaxing stay and would definitely return in future.",5,2016,09,01
119,Stay aboard,What a wonderful place to stay. Absolutely enjoyed it. Great room (very big) lots of wardrobe space and large shower. There is a very nice restaurant but be sure to book a table in advance as they get fully booked quite quickly. Will definitely be coming back again soon. ,5,2016,09,01
119,Short Break,We had a wonderful time here at this hotel to celebrate my husbands birthday.  Our room was larger than we expected and had a balcony overlooking the water.  The bar at the rear of the yacht was a lovely place to sit in the sunshine and enjoy a nice pre dinner drink with nibbles. The Dinner was fine dining and we were spoilt for choice.  The staff were friendly and efficient.  We felt like royalty.  Would definitely go again.  ,5,2016,09,01
119,Amazing. Highly recommended to anyone visiting London for the first time. 😃,"It was my friend and colleague Caitlin's and myself first time to London and we both wanted to make it as less stressful and more relaxing as possible. Upon arrival we were slightly late for a table booked for dinner but it wasn't a problem at all to the staff and they were happy to seat us as soon as we arrived. The meal was beautiful and the right temperature, the right amount and presented on the plate beautifully. We both had a voucher from Groupon which enabled us to a executive room which I have to say was an amazing room with a lovely view from the terrace, it was clean, spacious and exactly what I booked. Both off us slept really well and looked forward to our amazing breakfast the next morning. Making our way to breakfast we were greeted by a waitress who kindly told us that the tables are full and that we would have to wait a bit which was completely fine, working in a 5* hotel myself I'm aware what it's like. After being seated another waitress asked us if we wanted tea and coffee and told us about the buffet breakfast. The food was lovely and there were lots of it, the scrambled egg was a little on the cool side but I suppose it can't be helped, the Danish (croissants etc.) were cold which I didn't know if they meant to be or not. Apart from that it was a wonderful breakfast, lovely staff and a wide range of fruits, cereals and hot food. Checking out couldn't be easier, the receptionist told us we had a refundable amount of money which was put like a tab on our room upon checking in which he asked if we wanted it refunded or not and asked how our stay was. All the receptionists were really helpful smiling all the time and didn't make anything to confusing. All together it was a brilliant stay and we both would highly recommended to anyone who wants a brilliant night sleep in an iconic yacht hotel. Thank you Sunborn hopefully see you next time.

119,Very nice,"A little out of central London but worth the journey in.

Cannot fault the staff. Very helpful and friendly.

Had a waterside balcony room. Very big and peaceful. Had to pay a £40 upgrade fee but see another reviewer got the waterside room for no extra.

Drinks dear but that is what you expect from a London hotel. Had a great gin based one. (Thanks Jay and Viki).

Would visit again. ",5,2016,08,31
119,"Great venue, nice staff, disappointing cream tea","First time visit here for special occasion. Fabulous setting, lovely staff, great service but disappointing food.  Some of the bread for the sandwiches was slightly stale, and whilst some was very tasty the white bread was bland and tasted of nothing.  The extra cost we chose for the lobster, prawn. crab and cod sandwiches was a complete waste of money.  Quite tasteless apart from the prawn, not much filling in any.  The sandwiches on the cheaper option were ok, but nothing special.  

Scones were fine.  The cakes were very disappointing, nothing you couldn't pick up in M & S or Waitrose.  Tea was fine, but both my milk jug and tea pot were chipped.  
Overall, edible, some bits quite nice but nothing special, certainly not value for money.",4,2016,08,30
119,Birthday Celebration,"Booked through groupon for a 1 night stay including an evening meal in the Lands Ends restaurant. The whole experience was wonderful, staff were plentiful and extremely polite and helpful. Our room was clean and comfortable and the food was outstanding.
Drinks were a little pricey but it was London.
Very easy to get to, just head to the Excel when you get off the DLR.

I would definitely go again and recommend this hotel to all my friends and famiy.",5,2016,08,30
119,Fantastic stay again ,"This is the 2nd visit and again it didn't disappoint. I got such a great deal off of Groupon, which included one night stay, a main meal with a glass of wine and breakfast also included for £200. This was a birthday treat for my partner and he loved it. The rooms are very spacious and very fancy. We had a riverside view, so was lovely to sit outside on the balcony looking out to the river and taking in the views. The food is delicious and cooked to a very high standard and the service is just as good. Only thing that was slightly disappointing was that I had emailed a few days prior to our visit asking if they would be able to maybe bring out a desert for my partners birthday but I had no response and they clearly hadn't received my email. We also had afternoon tea, which was lovely but not worth the price you pay for it. Besides that was a wonderful stay and I can't wait to stay again.

119,Suprise anniversary ,Very disappointed with this hotel booked it for suprise for wife had all ready told hotel was special anniversary did mot make a fuss nothing in room even though they say they left chocolates and card in room for the money you pay at hotel you xan get far better for your money does not include any food or breakfast in the hotel price disappointed as expected nicer hotel surroundings etc drinks very expensive check in was at 3 room wasn't even ready and nothing fancy in room very plain you can get much nicer in center of London fir the same price,2,2016,08,30
119,sunborn review,"We stayed here on the 7th August 2016.
We had a state room which was, clean and very comfortable.
I would highly recommend. 
The breakfast was very tasty and the choice was excellent.
The staff were helpful and friendly.

The drinks were expensive, but has a one off we thought it was fine.",5,2016,08,30
119,Anniversary Treat,"We booked through booking.com as a treat to celebrate our anniversary. Beautiful settings and easy to get too. We had lunch on the terrace, which is beautiful if you have the weather as we did, service was a bit slow and i didn't see much staff around so maybe this is why? The restaurant was fully booked so we couldn't get a table for dinner but a short walk across the bridge and we were at a lovely tapas bar. We took a stroll back and had a few more drinks in the bar before heading back to our room and spending the evening with drinks on the balcony over looking the river. The rooms are Stunning! Great size, fridge to stock up if need be, huge bed and nice dressing gowns to give it that luxury feel. Reception staff were fab, very helpful.
This is special night away, i would 100% recommend.",4,2016,08,30
119,Poor quality...not a 5* spa hotel at all!,"Myself and a friend visited this hotel yesterday... admittidly we were there on a package deal but still paid alot of money for the stay. On arrival we were told our room was not ready which was fine as we were early. The receptionist took our bags, failed to give us a reciept and requested we returned at 3pm. She also said dinne reservation was not available so perhaps we should book ourselves. 

We tried but was told the only reservation time left was 9pm. Thats way too late to eat a meal.

However we booked and went out for lunch. On return to check in the que was enormous and as we had already waited this was slightly annoying.

The rooms are lovely but not 5*

We did hold out for dinner but the restaurant appeared only part full throughout the evening. The deal included main course and wine.

The meal was tiny and only luke warm. I had the pork and my friend had the salmon. Her dish was so salty she could not eat it. I ordered a side of new potatoes. These were clearly microwaved and then cold. There was approx 7 small potatoes for over £4. 

The staff appeared to be so tired they couldnt wait for the restaurant to empty.

Breakfast this morning was ok! Lots of choice, however we arrived just at opening as we were travelling early. The hot options were only luke warm again. This may have been because the restaurant was extremely cold. We was not offered more tea or coffee.

Extremely disapointed with whole stay. We were looking forward to it so much. Maybe if you dont stay on a package deal it may be better",1,2016,08,30
119,waste of money,"on arrival we were shown our room (supposed to be a good room with water side view on the upper deck)
the room was average with a tiny bathroom ,the airccon was set at 15 which made the room like a fridge, and the carpet was stained after 1/2 an hr of adjusting the heating we complained ,in the new room the aircon worked but the carpet was just as bad (had i been offered a refund I would have taken it and run ).We had booked to eat in the restaurant on board ,parts of my meal were tasteless and the fillet of sea bass was taken from a fish that should have been thrown back as it was so small,the potatoes were cold (as though they had been removed from the freezer and dropped in a fat fryer and then served),very disappointing.We had tried to book two nights but could only get the one (just wish it had been fully booked now ) The boat is dated inside and not luxury just tired.",2,2016,08,30
119,Groupon offer,"Booked in May as overnight stay with meal and wine. We had a lovely experience room fab I recommend upgrade to balcony, river view and get your room as high as possible we were on 5th floor and the view was stunning. A hot beautiful day so sat outside the bar with drinks. Only downside was the horrendously slow bar service outside then drinks were incorrect... It took 30 mins from getting drinks menu to receiving drinks then an hour between drinks to be served again. I would say the Sunborn is more 3* than 4* but nonetheless had a wonderful memorable stay. Be warned about the constant booming planes taking off directly ahead it can be a conversation stopper!  ",4,2016,08,29
119,A wonderful place to stay!,"We booked a one night stay on the Sunborn & would highly recommend it! We couldn't fault anything - the staff were very helpful, the food at dinner & breakfast was delicious & our room was very spacious, clean & extremely comfortable! The Sunborn is in a great location with very easy access to the 02 and central London. We had a great time & will definitely stay here again!",5,2016,08,29
119,Unable to accommodate dining although room booked and paid for,"Unfortunately I have had another bad experience in London. I booked a stay at this supposed 5 star hotel for a special occasion, my Girlfriends 60th Birthday, of which they were well aware from previous communications to find we are unable to dine at the Restuarant, although we are paying Guests .., and not that impressed my I add. 
I find it unbelievable that although we hadn't reserved a table they could not sort something out anytime tonight bearing in mind the circumstances. We have had an absolutely brilliant experience at a Hotel nearby over the last few days, of which you are more than welcome to read my reviews but unfortunately this experience has ruined the celebration and brought it to an ubrupt end which is distressing 
......,,",2,2016,08,29
119,A hotel with a differences,"Once we saw this hotel, we just had to book it and at the time was a great price.

The room we were allocated was very spacious and the cleaning standard was one of the best we have seen.

The area surrounding the hotel is very quite at night, the bar had some amazing cocktails and the view was just great - especially at night.",5,2016,08,29
119,Beautiful and restful,"Our 2 night stay on board this luxury yacht hotel was wonderful. This was a special treat for us and I had also bought one of the romantic package as a surprise for my wife, which she loved. We booked a classic room which was lovely and roomy with mini fridge safe, tv and a tablet computer next to the bed, the bed was enormous and soo comfortable. I am disabled and use a mobility scooter and there was plenty of space in the room for it. The room and shower room was spotless, and air conditioning as standard. The staff at reception were very helpful and polite asking my wife if she needed help with the suitcase to our room. Because I am disabled and have a blue badge for the car I was allowed to park right outside of the yacht at no extra charge which is brilliant. We had cocktails in the bar on our last night, which has a balcony looking over to the O2 and London skyline. All in all a brilliant weekend and definitely recommended. Well done The Sunborn for making it special.",5,2016,08,29
119,nice place,"me and my longterm partner checked in to this yacht hotel for our anniversary...its a lovely place, and we all loved the amenities in our room... the breakfast is superb, topnotch! would love to go back for a longer stay... thanks a lot to Timea who has been very friendly on the reception 😀",4,2016,08,28
119,Quirky and gorgeous,"We stayed at the hotel on Friday night as part of a Groupon offer that I got. We paid £199 for two, with breakfast and dinner (main and wine) included and it was well worth the money. 

The staff were very friendly when we arrived. We weren't able to check in until 3pm so we dumped our bags and headed to the city. We got back early evening and got ready for the restaurant. The food was amazing - nice small selection and superbly cooked. We added starters and desserts on and these were priced as per a good restaurant price wise. Mains around the high £20-mid £30 mark. Starters were around £5-6 and desserts the same (if I remember correctly - check menu online though). The cheesecake was out of this world :)

Later that evening we had drinks on the deck (I'd say London club/hotel prices) and then made our way to the upper deck where a retro gaming and silent disco was taking place (no extra charge to enter). It was brilliant and so much fun. The vibe was great and the age ranged from early 20's right up to 40's. A really lovely atmosphere.

Our room was very spacious, with large balcony and had a really huge bed in it, which was very comfortable. I'm sure the rooms must be soundproofed as well as we didn't hear any outside noise (and city airport flight path is just over the boat). The room has amazing black out curtains as well so you really do get a great nights sleep. All guests have free wifi as well. 

Another bonus was that breakfast was served until 11 which meant we could have a lie in (bliss) and check out was 12. Breakfast was really nice - buffet style - well stocked up and refreshed often. 

We had a great time at the hotel. It was very quirky, clean and tastefully done. I'm not sure what the full price room rates are and I'm not sure I would pay more than what we did just for the B&B but we had a great night and really enjoyed out Groupon bargain.

There are also pubs/bars/restaurants close to the boat if you wanted to eat/drink out. ",5,2016,08,28
119,"Beautiful yacht, noisy cabin","The yacht is a few stops out of London but this didn't bother us as we wanted something special as it was our last trip away before we have our first child. The yacht was beautiful and the facilities were amazing. The only major downside was the air conditioning generator which was outside our window, was on all night whether you were using it or not. This was very noisy and I didn't manage to get any sleep. When I complained in the morning as it was the worst nights sleep I had had in a hotel I was told all the classic rooms were the same. If I was told this at the start I would have not booked as for us £137 per night was meant to be a lovely treat. The next day we went straight home instead of spending the day in London as I just wasn't well enough. So disappointed but would say pay the extra money for a cabin with a balcony and maybe you won't experience the same problem but for us we could afford that.",3,2016,08,28
119,Lovely hotel In a great setting,"Stayed here for my birthday 

Easy check in , all the desks were manned so not much wait . Stayed in a water side room and we were impressed how large the room was for the money . 

We had a few drinks in the bar which was expensive but on a par with other top hotel prices so not a rip off . There are other bars nearby that are cheaper if it bothers you .

Breakfast is expensive at £19 per person so we wandered to the left off the ship and eat a full breakfast at the Marina Grill for £14 for both of us including tea . If you want a better quality breakfast the wander down a little further towards the cable car and there is a place on the right that does a full breakfast for £8 per person.

There is a Tesco express down towards the cable car if you want to stock up on your own food and drink.

It's easy assess to the centre of London or Stratford International via Custom House DLR station so good for tourist visits.

Only minor niggle is that despite it being a couples room there is only one tea bag and only one sachet of hot chocolate , a strange cost cutting when they use Moulton Brown toiletries in the bathroom as I'm sure a tea bag costs pennies .

We will stay here again ! ",4,2016,08,28
119,brilliant customer service,"Upon arrival very friendly. Room was clean and of a high standard.  The bar area was prestige with an outside smoking area which also had table service.  The bar staff in particular Isabel, Victoria and Say were perfect and we will be definitely be coming back",5,2016,08,27
119,"Lovely hotel, but expensive","Had a lovely nights stay but we're very shocked to discover that despite the cost of drinks being quite expensive we were charged a service charge on top at the bar.

Nice night, but not sure we'd return due to high prices.

Staff were very friendly and helpful but high prices spoilt it",4,2016,08,26
119,Week break,"My wife booked out summer break at this hotel on group on as a deal which came with a main meal and glass of wine at diner.
My wife is a vegetarian with a garlic allergy, we arrived on the Wednesday and our diner was booked for the Friday night my wife told them of the dietary needs and looked forward to our meal.
Well there was nothing prepared and they just left half the produce from the meal which my wife could not have, just like fish and chips but leave off the fish.
They had two full days to prepare something and failed.
The staff were friendly and tried to give a service but it fell short.
They couldn't Evan get a drinks order right.
Will not stay here again Evan if it is a deal.",2,2016,08,26
119,Birthday Treat,"Just returned from an overnight stay on the yacht for hubbys birthday. We did not book direct with Sunborn as it was cheaper via another site. Check in (from 3pm) was very efficient. £40 is deducted from your card towards any expenses and refunded upon chwcking out if not/partially used. We chose to ""upgrade"" to a river view cabin which was under £140 for the night (breakfast not included). Lovely  room. Very clean, comfortable and spacious with large bed and lounge area. Plenty of wardrobe space but only 4 coat hangers?? TV with freeview channels, iron and ironing board, in-room tablet for browsing, free WiFi, spacious shower (no bath), molten brown shampoo, conditioner,soap and bodywash, hairdryer (not very powerful!!), coffee machine and kettle. Small selection of teabags but only 1 of each variety? Bottle each of still and sparkling water in fridge (free for use). Nice bar with small outdoor seating deck. Good selection of drinks with typical London prices. We chose not to eat onboard as had made arrangements to eat at a nearby pub in the evening but menu looked nice although quite pricey. Breakfast £20 (I believe) each. Normal London hotel price but we had a ""full English"" breakfast in Marina grill (right outside, turn left) for £4.95 which was exactly as expected!!! Plenty of places nearby as right next to Excel. Overall a fantastic stay. Good age range of guests and a smart/casual environment. Would highly recommend and can't wait to return. ",5,2016,08,26
119,Fantastic a wow factor 👍👍👏👏👏,"Went on this lovely yacht,for my husband birthday.We had a fab room,staff friendly food wonderfull,the whole 24 hours on board fab. Would recommend this experience.Thankyou sunborn for a truly memorable time👏👏👏👏👏",5,2016,08,26
119,Sunborn Hotel Yacht,"I booked a night's stay through Groupon for hubs BD.  Lovely location but room didn't have water view,,,
Staff very friendly but service appallingly slow, wasn't just us but others muttering about having to wait for a drinks waiter to come and take our order. Only 2 staff at the bar both working the bar and terrace,,,
Dinner was very nice but again service not good, a vital part of main course was left off, but we weren't informed upon ordering, as they had run out,,, they did kindly take off our started as an apology...
At breakfast, buffet, we had to wait for about 20 mins for pot of coffee to arrive. Another lady was clearly disgruntled that she had to wait for 15 mins for a new server of hash browns to be replenished.
No brown sauce or English mustard...run out...
Staff very polite but clearly poorly managed..
We did speak to the manager upon leaving who was very apologetic but we just wanted to make them aware so that they can make improvements,, again our drinks bill was not charged as an Apology, which we weren't looking for .  It was such a shame as it is a fabulous venue and we were both really looking forward to it..
I do hope that things improve and we are sure that we weren't the only people airing our frustrations from that trip.",1,2016,08,26
119,Amazing ,Everything was perfect. We had a Groupon voucher and the service and food was excellent.  The room was huge with bathrobes and slippers provided. Reception were friendly. Would recommend for a luxury break.,5,2016,08,26
119,Upset,"I booked this back in May for my daughters 50 th with the manager Andreas who promised me we would be looked after cause he was away August .

So although my daughter was upgraded which was lovely ,the evening meal for 6 of us turned out to be disappointing .Faulty towers comes to mind ..
The manager was apologetic it wasn't his fault ... But I'm very sad at the whole episode and experience .",3,2016,08,26
119,Awful,"Don't be fooled by the reviews, dirty stained carpets, food really awful (dry chicken with bones) fishy fish and tables weirdly low so expect bruised knees. It's right next to London city airport so enjoy regular overhead planes. Staff nice enough but not to the standards of the prices. More stressful than relaxing. Location not great, views pretty ugly - except on deck.",1,2016,08,26
119,A very special setting with friendly staff but.....,"I booked this as a birthday treat and there is no denying it offers something very special and very different. It is a beautiful ship; very luxurious. I loved having supper and breakfast looking out towards the city of London. The bedroom was great, with a really comfy king size. The reception staff and waiters in the restaurant are very attentive. However food was mediocre. (  Beautifully presented but my steak was over done!) and Service was the slowest I have ever experienced. ( 20 mins waiting for a cheese board) You also need to be aware just how close it into city airport! 
Nevertheless we thoroughly enjoyed our stay- it was a special deal and I feel worth what I paid but I would not have said it is worth the prices they quote usually. 
A tip.....if using it to visit London....walk to the cable cars and cross the river and then take the river bus from North Greenwich Pier. A wonderful way to see London and very reasonable.",4,2016,08,26
119,Four star with five star feeling,"We thoroughly enjoyed our stay at Sunborn and although this is not a reasonably priced four star hotel it provides excellent service and quality food in a very nice environment.
Our party of three couples were all impressed and all want a return visit. 
The dining experience was relaxed and all meals were first class. The John Dory was cooked to perfection.
The lounge bar was relaxing but a shame we could not enjoy the decks as it was raining.
The rooms were very comfortable and surprisingly spacious with a balcony too.
Great weekend break and thank you to the management and staff for making us feel so welcome. ",4,2016,08,25
119,location and dinner was amazing,"the boat is lovely and the rooms are very spacious and have the most lovely view on the balcony. The décor is quite dated but as it has such a luxurious feel its not really something to ruin the experience.

the dinner we had was AMAZING! the lamb and beef dishes myself and my boyfriend had were without doubt the best of those kind we've ever had. I even popped my head into the kitchen to compliment the chef on the beset lamb I've ever had.

Our waiter Roman was very accommodating and friendly and made sure we had a good dining experience.

The breakfast massively let our trip down however. Lack of food and rude, bolshie staff rushing around.

We paid £200 for the night with dinner through groupon which we thought was good value for money. We're not sure how much it would normally cost but I wouldn't have paid much more than that.",4,2016,08,25
119,"Glamorous, modern and great fun!","My wife, son & I thoroughly enjoyed our stay here. We ended up driving and parked in the Excel Centre (only £15 which is cheap for London; took someone else's advice and parked on the west-side so it was a short stroll to the hotel/ship!).

The ship was incredible, plenty of space, really attentive staff. We decided to get room service as we had our young son; it was fairly reasonably priced and was great quality. We washed it down with some yummy cocktails.

The location is great; access to the whole of london via the DLR.",5,2016,08,25
119,Do not bother,"My Mum booked this for my 50th Birthday treat. The Yacht looks super impressive form the outside and the reception area and rooms also look ok. My room was very nice 5034 there were black marks on the carpet and a bit of dust on the tv but not too bad. 

The meal...another story.

We were not in the restaurant but away from it by the stairs there was 6 of us so hardly a large group. The Manager n the restaurant explained in broken English that we was put there because he wanted us to feel comfy. ...ok... we got ignored not once but several times.My sister ordered 2 mock tails, one for her as she was driving and one for my 14 year old niece, however when they arrived she tasted it and thought it had alcohol in it, oh woops said the waitress the barman thought I said 2 mi-ti and not bi-ti. So the manager was called who offered us a paltry free drink after the meal. Not good enough.

We finished our starter which was pretty poor and waited 45 minutes for someone to clear the plate. I asked for more bread, that took 20 minutes and 20 minutes for another jug of water.

The main course arrived, I had pork loin that was dryer than a cotton wall ball and so tough I had to saw at it several times. My daughter and niece had chicken and didn't eat it all as they said it was just like normal chicken and tasteless.

Again we waited , my sister complained again and the Manager stated our paid for meals would be complimentary, to me this was just a joke.

Again we waited for menus to chose our sweet then the manager had to be reminded that my mother had bought a birthday cake which he eventually bought out.The stroppy waitress stormed over to retrieve the menus after we said we wasn't having sweet as we couldnt be bothered waiting an hour for it, my Sister told her she was the rudest person she has encountered that day and of she went with her tail between her legs.
  The manager asked for our room numbers...no idea why because when we checked out he had done nothing to our room bill to eleviate the sadness I felt.

I got home and realised I had left a t shirt behind and the woman on the phone told me I would have to pay postage for I to be sent back, I told her I would not be paying £2.50 postage for a small t shirt and the lest they could do after the horrendous performance they showed in the restuarant was to send it to me at their expense which she agreed.

I feel quite sad that my Mum put in so much effort to make me happy for my 50th and to go to such a posh place and be treated like a peasant was not on my bucket list.

Remember don't judge a book by its cover

119,Lovely night away,"Me and my girlfriend stayed and ate here for a birthday night away back in July. 
We stayed in an executive suite and payed £20 extra for a river view (which in my opinion was worth it) 
Unfortunately there was an extra cost for the little touches to make my girlfriends birthday nicer when entering the room (which we have had in another recent London hotel for nothing..) which we decided not to go for because we found the cost high for what was offered... 
The room itself was nice with a big super comfortable bed. 
A few marks on the carpet though which wasn't so nice but overall the room was adequate. 
The food we has was amazing and both enjoyed very much. 
",4,2016,08,24
119,"Friendly Staff, facilities good, but prices a little indistinct","The Sunborn is a beautiful yacht, our family room was lovely. The housekeeping staff kept the room clean. The reception staff were very friendly and attentive.
The only downsides we found were these: the quick flush in our bathroom did not work and even when reported was not fixed. Our door cards kept deactivating, on one occasion I had to go back to Reception to ask them to activate it two times the first time was because we couldn't get in the room, so I had to ask them again, on the second time it worked.
When we left the yacht my husband paid and afterward showed me the receipt.  We had been given an email price of £230 per night for our three night stay, but the bill said that the price went up each night - the third night was £300.  Even though it was explained to me, I still couldn't understand how I could have an email invoice stating the bill was to be £230 per night, I now had to pay more and nowhere in the email did it suggest that the rate would change daily. The Receptionist said that IT department was trying to rectify the discrepancy so that it was clearer.
  I hope that they sort it as I love staying there, but I don't want any surprises next time!!",4,2016,08,24
119,Absolutely gorgeous yacht,"We booked this through a deal and we were not disappointed at all.  The check in was quick and efficient in beautiful surroundings with the sweeping staircase.  Our room was a dockside room and was absolutely beautiful.  The bathroom was spotless as was the room.  The bed was comfortable and there were two dressing gowns and slippers provided as well.  The whole room had a touch of luxury about it.  

We had drinks on the deck as the weather was beautiful when we were there.  The cocktails were amazing and the service was great.

We had dinner in the restaurant on board and although a little on the pricey side it was well worth it.  The food and service were all brilliant.  Breakfast was in the main restaurant and there was plenty to choose from.  Cereal, pastries, toast, cooked breakfast, smoked salmon and fruit.  All delicious.

I cannot fault this yacht at all.  We had an amazing weekend.  Thank you :-)",5,2016,08,24
119,A real treat.,"Stayed for a couple of nights as a couple in August. Wow, just wow. Luxury surroundings, scenic views, extremely attentive and helpful staff. The rooms have been soundproofed and so you cannot hear any of the usual noises you get from hotel corridors. Obviously all this doesn't come cheap, but I would definitely recommend treating yourself to a stay here. We will definitely be going back!",5,2016,08,24
119,Fantastic stay,Great place to stay so different.  Staff were very helpful and decor and cleanliness excellent.  Lots to do Emirates cable car really good for having a different view of London. The bar and cocktails of an evening are great with the view at night.Can't wait to go back we found lots of new places to explore in London and realized that there is more to London than museums and shops.,5,2016,08,24
119,Fabulous Location - different and great experience,"This looks like a super yacht and feels like a good hotel. Its immediately next to the Excel and a stones throw from the O2. 

I upgraded to a suite and that was incredible. Bathroom size of small apartment with sauna and jaccuzzi. Private terrace that could have hosted a party for 30! big bedroom and separate lounge which converted to a very sizeable second bedroom.

Staff work hard and are all foreign so you do need to ensure that they actually understand your requests and actually get on it I did have to chase them on a couple of occasions. 

Food.... breakfast was typical hotel fare... fine and hot... suggest order the omeltte as its fresh and good where as the breakfast didnt I admit look the best.

Dinner .. didnt eat their at night but it looked good.

We were plying from City Airport which is just five minutes away... good call!! Made for great start to our holiday!",4,2016,08,24
119,Great place to celebrate a special occasion,"Nothing is too much trouble for the staff at Sunborn.  We planned our function via email from Australia with Carlos who had everything organised when we arrived.  We were waited on all evening by the bar staff, Alex, Julian, Arturo and Nico.  Our party guests were all very impressed and we all agree that Sunborn staff are the best when it comes to hospitality.  Thank you to everyone for yet another amazing visit to London.  We will see you again for sure!",5,2016,08,23
119,London for $100/Nt?! ,"My hubby and I were in London for a few days to attend his childhood mate's wedding.  We wanted to stay somewhere relatively cheap, but still clean and well located.  We are also more adventurous, so the idea of a floating hotel sounded very appealing.  This place worked out great.  The rooms are spacious, clean, and quiet.  We didn't eat there, so I can't vouch for the food or room service.  Also, we wanted a balcony room, and we were told that the hotel was completely booked. C'est la vie!  It is located right by the ExCel Convention Center, so I can believe that it was booked up.  It is probably one of the best deals in the area if you are going to the ExCel.  Speaking of the area, it has really been cleaned up over the years, and is very charming now with shops, pubs, and eateries all around in every price range.  Also, the Emirates Airline Cable Car Terminal is only a few steps away, accepts Oyster card, and drops right off at the O2 Arena where the North Greenwich tube  access is located. Alternatively, there is a platform that leads to Silvertown and you can connect from there, but the views from the cable car are really a welcome change!  One star off for parking, which is a complete pain...you have to park in the giant parking garage attached to the ExCel, whereas other area hotels have ample on-site parking.  If, however, you don't have a car to worry about, you'd be fine.  Definitely a good deal for the price!  ",4,2016,08,23
119,A great find,"Great place for something different . Moored up , a floating hotel . Very luxurious . Huge bedroom , huge bed . Very attentive staff , lovely decor . Everything you need in the room . Wi fi good even a tablet to use ( at times a little sketchy ) Beautiful foyer . We took at boat to Greenwich and the o2 cable car which drops you a short walk from the yacht , all very James bond ! Definitely worth a visit",5,2016,08,23
119,"""Ruby Wedding Anniversary Night""","We stayed for one night as part of our Ruby Wedding celebration .  We had a lovely room over looking the Dock , it is definitely worth paying extra to have a dock side room with balcony to get the feeling of being on the boat .
The evening meal was excellent as was the service.
The only reason I'm not giving it full marks is I feel the breakfast is very ordinary. It's buffet style English breakfast which is very tasty but for this standard of hotel I would have expected a cooked to order breakfast with a few more interesting options. Also the only fresh fruit was melon the rest was tinned. That said we did have a very lovely stay and I would recommend it.",4,2016,08,23
119,Something Different but very enjoyable!,"Over the weekend we spent a night on the Sunborn Yacht - Executive room with a river view (4th Floor). We parked our car over night at Excel for £15 per night. TIP: Park near the exit at the far end of the carp park because you will only have a short walk down the ramp to the Yacht, which is on the left handsome, parallel with the Novotel. The reception is accessible via a lift. Once the lift doors open on the third floor you will be presented with a nice brass staircase. The reception is on the right hand side and we were greeted by friendly staff and some fresh orange juice. The bar/lounge is directly behind reception - several nice sofa's and you overlook Victoria Dock, the O2 and Canary Wharf. The Restaurant is on the fourth floor (on top of reception and the lounge) - again you overlook Victoria Dock etc. Make sure you book a table in advance and if you are lucky, you might get one of the tables overlooking Victoria Dock. On the fifth floor there is a Sky Bar, however this was not open during our visit - not sure why. The rear of the boat has an open deck area with seats and tables - floors 3 to 5. All deck areas are accessible via the Lounge, Restaurant,  or Sky Bar (depending on what floor you are on). Our room was really spacious and well kept. There were some nice chocolates on the coffee table for us to enjoy and balcony area was a nice to have, albeit quite small. There was a window tablet in our room, which provided us with plenty of information about the spa, restaurant etc. We were amazed with how well kept the room was - particularly the wooden furniture! We spent the afternoon in the lounge area - had a couple of Rose Champagne and shared a healthy platter for two. We also booked a table in the restaurant and we were lucky enough to get a table for two right at the front of the restaurant over-looking Victoria Dock (as described above). The a la carte menu had a great selection of meals, some really good wines and deserts. I thought the price of the a la carte menu was a little on the expensive side but all in all a great experience. The staff were good and attentive as well. After dinner we went for a walk around the key side where we actually noticed a number of different restaurants - Lebanese, Grill, Japanese, Indian and a Thai Restaurant over by the water sports centre. TIP: If staying for two nights, consider Dinner on the Yacht and then exploring one of the other restaurant another night. After the walk we retired back to the bar and had a couple of cocktails - very tasty! Breakfast was served in the restaurant again (7am to 11am - Sunday). Great selection - cereals, breads, pastries, fruit, smoked salmon and a buffet cooked breakfast. After breakfast we checked out - earlier than 12 and went for a walk. We took a trip on the Emirates Cable Cars over to the O2 before coming back and taking a walk around Victoria Docks and back via the tall bridge that sits just in front of the Yacht. We thoroughly enjoyed our stay on Sunborn, we were looked after by the staff and we would definitely consider staying there again if we were visiting Excel or O2. I hope you find this useful - sorry about the length of this review.",4,2016,08,23
119,Amazing!!,"My partner brought us a stay here for two nights on a groupon deal. We truly got our money's worth! 

The room was amazing, the service spectacular and the overall look of the hotel was amazing. 

Although the bar is quite pricey, we enjoyed our meal. If it wasn't part of our offer we most probably would not have had dinner there due to the prices. Breakfast was exquisite! 

I thoroughly recommend here! ",5,2016,08,23
119,Fabulous cocktails ,"We were staying close by but could not resist having a drink on this luxury hotel yacht. Overlooking canary wharf in the distance and close to the Emirates sky ride to the 02 arena the area is full of bars and restaurants, highly recommended ",4,2016,08,23
119,Date Night Pt 2,"OMG, OMG, OMG this hotel is beautiful and unique, i cant believe its in london, i find out about this amazing hotel from deal website and when to have drinks there but not stay but after the drinks i so come back to stay

The staff are amazing, friendly and happy to find you with picking a good cocktail and any other in question - i cant wait to go back to stay hopeful in the summer",4,2016,08,23
119,Wonderful ,"After reading mixed reviews I was not sure if our stay would be as good as we hoped. Not to fear it was wonderful. Lovely room, very friendly and helpful staff and fabulous food. Thoroughly recommend it. 
Sadly we didn't get to use the spa but would definitely return and will book a treatment next time .",5,2016,08,22
119,Bar and Restaurant Only,"Sunday evening around 6pm.  A group of 5. We sat by the bar and were told it was waiter service only (what's the point in having a bar?)

Moved over to our seats in the restaurant. Very friendly staff. It's a pity that we often had half a dozen staff around our table due to the location of the table.

The food; definitely not worth the price.  It was ok. 

Overall, it's quite tacky. If you want to spend your hard-earned on a nice family meal, I would certainly look elsewhere.",2,2016,08,22
119,"""Truly spectacular""","We stayed at the Sunborn London on 18th August and were extremely impressed.

The entire yacht hotel is spotlessly clean and is furnished to a very high standard.  The suite that we stayed in was very spacious and we had a fabulous view of the water from the balcony.

The restaurant has excellent views and serves a quality breakfast with lots of choice which included a traditional or continental variety.  The dinner menu has a very good selection, the lamb and pork cheeks were both exceptional.  

The staff are friendly, professional, efficient and cannot do enough for you.  Special thanks to Olivia on reception for her excellent service and to Rita in the restaurant for resolving my query with my table booking.

I cannot wait for my next visit to the Sunborn!",5,2016,08,22
119,"Great Hotel, Great Location","I recently spent 2 nights on the Sunborn Yacht Hotel in London. We had a fantastic stay with there being so much to like. The staff are very attentive, and their customer service is very good indeed. They always greeted you with a smile and nothing was ever too much trouble. 
The rooms are so spacious, and the bed is amazing. We had great nights sleep on both nights, and the rooms themselves are very well presented. The food was great, and once again, well presented. 
The Yacht is also very clean indeed, and the cleaners do a great job, all with smiles on their faces. 
The Sunborn is in a fantastic location being close to the Excel and O2, but also close to the DLR so you can be in the centre of London in 30 minutes. 
Overall a great stay, with great staff which very much enhanced our weekend experience.",5,2016,08,22
119,"Great concept, location and value for money","Great concept, location and value for money. The Sunborn is moored in Royal Victoria Dock alongside Excel Centre – but you do not get any sense of floating or motion as the vessel is securely fixed to the dockside. We stayed here for one night arrived around 3pm to find a check in queue. Check in took 15 minutes and as queue lengthened behind us as more guests arrived it would take much longer. Not a good start but thereafter everything was fine – top 5th deck executive room with balcony very swish, cruise ship style and spacious also well equipped with safe, mini bar fridge, tea/coffee making, ironing board, dressing gowns and slippers.  You get a kettle and Ritazza machine which we could not get to work. Only thing missing in room was a note pad and pen. Free wifi everywhere albeit we could not get it to work – but had our own mifi.  We chose not to dine en board after the check in but did have a drink in the bar. There are good selection of restaurants nearby within 5 min walk - Italian (Zero Sette and La Barrique), Chinese (China Palace), 2 Indian (Bollywood Brasserie and Marina Grill), Brasseries (Top 1 Forever), Spanish (Tapa Tapa), Lebanese (Al Masar).  Breakfast was buffet style and very good. Location is handy for Excel and O2 events (via Emirates Cable car), London City Airport (you do get low flying aircraft overhead) and alongside DLR Customs House station. Overall very good and if they sorted out check in could have been excellent especially considering price of £170 B&B. ps: you get a fantastic night time view of London skyline and aircraft taking off from the Royal Victoria Dock Foot Bridge, which is also the best place to photograph the Sunborn Yacht - well worth climbing the stairs - lift is dubious!",4,2016,08,22
119,A different kind of hotel,"As a Londoner, I'd recommend the Sunborn, particularly if you're in town for an event at excel or the O2. Beautiful boat with plush reception and bar and large cabins even on the lower deck. Rooms tick all the boxes with lots of mirrors, hanging space and plug sockets. Nice touches such as Lavazza coffee machine, complimentary water, Molton Brown toiletries and vouchers for free champagne in the bar all make for a luxury stay.",5,2016,08,21
119,Luxurious and extremely comfortable,"This yacht hotel is a unique luxury experience in London. We stayed there for the night as a couple and all we can say it is wonderful. We arrived early for the checkin and already there was a queue but it moved quick enough and a welcome drink while waiting was very refreshing. 

We stayed on the 4th floor facing river. It is a good size with large mirrors facing the large bed. Everything in there was well laid out and clean. It was also surprisingly very quiet.

We didn't have dinner at their restaurants, so can't comment on that. We hadn't booked breakfast, but could just walk in and had an early breakfast which was way cheaper than advertised. We were initially thinking of having breakfast outside. There are so many cafes near to royal docks and excel London which are just few minutes walk from hotel. We decided to take early breakfast offer and were not let down by the food. It was delicious.",5,2016,08,21
119,Palatial,"After a great day climbing the O2 and travelling via the Emirates cable car we were blown away by the magnificent beauty of this yacht in dockside, just outside the excel. 
Reception was busy and check in rather laborious, but friendly.

Our cabin was enormous, a standard room, so no need to pay extra for an upgrade, the beds are to die for, best night sleep ever in a London hotel! Gorgeous toiletries, fluffy towels and posh coffee and a fridge in the cabin.

What a view whilst dining in the top quality restaurant, the pigs cheeks were mouthwatering beautiful.

Everyone was dressed for dinner and there was a real sense of occasion, celebrations for groups of hens, anniversary couples, first dates etc. very special place and a great find.",5,2016,08,21
119,Fab time,"Great staff; amazing location: real treat. The rooms here are comfortable bright and modern - definitely worth having a balcony cabin with river view
The restaurant was great for both dinner and breakfast
A few restaurants in the area and you can use the Emirates cable car to get to the O2 facilities until 23.00 now which is a bonus ",4,2016,08,21
119,A lovely stay ,"We stayed here for one night . We parked in the excel centre for s cost of £15 and had a 5 min walk to the yacht. We arrived at around 1pm on the Friday and went to the bar for a drink until we could check in at 3pm . The whole stay was just lovely . The food was really nice in a beautiful setting overlooking the London skyline . Breakfast was really great .. So much choice and was included in our stay ... When we booked it did state that breakfast was an extra. We walked out after breakfast onto the bridge and got some good photos. The staff could not be nicer.. Particularly Miriam on reception who couldn't do enough for you . 
You do not feel as though you are on the water , there is no movement whatsoever so good for anyone who suffers from motion sickness . 
We will definitely go back . We had a great weekend . ",5,2016,08,21
119,Celebrate in style,"Booked 19th Aug 2016, this really is a celebration destination, something different and a great experience. If you have time also walk along to the Emirates cable car, even better at night. The hotel attracts  people who want that special place to go to when you have something special to celebrate, even if that's just life itself. Just normal people out to enjoy the location, which near the DLR is ideal. The rooms and hotel itself are just great. Breakfast was plentiful and you are looked after by staff who care. Expect a warm welcome and enjoy your late night drink in the bar which has views of the city. Easy to get to, easy to find,easy to enjoy..",5,2016,08,21
119,What a delightful stay,"I went to the Sunbourn Hotel with my husband on a midweek night break. I had read the reviews on here - some bad but mostly good - and I was looking forward to staying get here. I was not disappointed. 
Making the reservation was so easy and simple and I was helpfully assisted by the reservation team who confirmed they had allocated me a lovely room.
 When we arrived there was a bit of a problem in driving into the allocated disabled car park; however that was soon rectified when a member of staff ( Agnes) came to meet us, directed us to the parking spot and helped us with our luggage. This gave us an indication that the service was going to be top notch. Agnes then booked us in, which was extremely efficient, and showed us to our room.
The room was amazing - Room 5032- and the view from the balcony was stunning. Definitely worth the extra £20 for a balcony looking over the river. Very comfortable and luxurious. We dined at the Lands End Restaurant where the service was top class and the food was absolutely delicious ( I had the saddle of lamb which was the best lamb I've tasted and I've had lamb at The Cliff in Barbados). Breakfast was equally as tasty and there was a huge variety of food. The late check out is a bonus also.
There is absolutely no doubt that I will be booking another night here and I would just like to thank all of the staff, especially Agnes, for making our stay so memorable. The staff are a credit to the hotel.

119,You wont need sealegs,"We spent  one night on the Sunborn  to celebrate  our pearl anniversary.  What can i say excellent  from start to finish. Check in was  a little  slow  but efficient . The room was lovely , roomy lovely furnishings , queen size bed lavazza coffee machine nice size bathroom  lovely  fittings  and Molton brown  toiletries.

119,What a gem,"Wow! Great surroundings, wonderful tea.
Very attentive team & beautiful touches to the cakes.
Felt like a princess being fussed over.
Pleasant team, clean & a fab view.
Go ""sea"" for yourself.
Enjoy the views, even from the ladies.

119,Classy and luxurious,"Beautiful boat, with well appointed rooms, picturesque views and lovely food.

Expensive, but a fantastic experience-Perfect for a night away with the missus (the getaway package includes dinner, accommodation and breakfast).

Hard to imagine a better hotel experience than sitting on the rear deck, in the sun, overlooking the river, with an ice cold drink in your hand!

Can't recommend highly enough.",5,2016,08,18
119,Comfort in a surprisingly good location,"The prices for Sunborn vary quite a bit and as it was a but of a bargain (cheaper than the ibis for example) we had a night there

The room/cabin had a view over the water and was spacious for London and very comfortable. The bed especially was great.

We fancied some cocktails but chose to explore the local area with the plan being to have drinks later in board. In fact the local bars and restaurants were so good we didn't actually use the bar or restaurant here

The Sunborn is more than just a novel, it's a very comfortable hotel, ideal for the O2 or exhibitions but also a great Base to explore the area and into London ",5,2016,08,18
119,Excellent first class service...Spectacular yacht!!!,"Not far from Canary Wharf, the yacht is situated in a quiet and relaxing dock, offering a selection of cafés, restaurants and even a Tesco. There's a sky-ride and a super man-made beach area nearby, excellent for keeping children entertained. The train station (DLR) offers travel into the centre of London otherwise private taxis are a good option (try 'kabbee' on Google). The Sunborn itself impresses immediately...glass lifts, stunning Reception area, wonderfully polite and friendly service (a special thank you to Timea), and great views including the Dome. The large room included a super comfy queen-sized bed, triple wardrobe, tv, dressing table,  sofa, coffee table,  large wall mirror, iron and board, and a safe. The bright and spacious en-suite had a double shower, heated floor, hairdryer and plenty of soft towels. The room was immaculately clean throughout thanks to the many room service attendants...excellent accommodation!  The bar and restaurant areas are 1st class. This has been an unforgettable experience and hope to return next year...a BIG thank you to all. Darren and Lorraine (room 1029).",5,2016,08,18
119,Birthday Visit,"Brought deal from Groupon for 1 Night for my partners birthday, large Que. on check in, large Que. on check out, when you offer a Groupon please have the staff to cope with the amount! however staff were extremely nice and very efficient, so no fault there. Dinner and wine glass each included, purchased beer and starter as extra, starter at 16.00 duck and lobster terrane, very pland,  plus cheese and biscuits to share, the food is nicely presented but way over priced and the walnut bread/crackers were appalling and so little cheese, this was 12.00!!! The room was nice, shame the balcony was not a little lower or the chairs not a little higher so we could see if we sat down. One suggestion would be a tie so the door to the terrace does not keep shutting. We were lucky with the weather and used the cable cars to arrive, purchased a bottle if prosecco, cokes, crisps and nuts at Tesco metro before boarding as were aware from other travellers that there was a fridge in room, this was a plus has drinks on board are expensive but thats London for you. The room was nice and clean, the bed very comfy, yes u do see and hear the planes but my partner loves that, so no problem for us.  Breakfast in morning was chaotic as asked to sit in side room, miles away from buffet, it was a firm no from me. Waited while they relied a table with a lovely view, however at now 1015, there was hardly anything left and had to keep asking to replenish the buffet!!!  I have stayed in far nicer and eaten in much better restaurants but this is a one off stay and i will never repeat it, so happy with experience but not A1 by any means.. ",3,2016,08,17
119,Best sleep in London ,"My husband and I have stayed in various hotels across London but this was the best nights sleep I've ever had. Quiet and dark at night. Reception were brilliant, very helpful and the rest of the staff were polite. Excellent location to visit the o2 arena. We had snacks and drinks outside on the terrace of the on board bar, all very nice and the breakfast was very tasty. We will definitely be returning ",5,2016,08,17
119,Engagement in Yacht - Outstanding Service by staff. Well Pleased with our stay,"Amazing service by staff - particularly 'Peter' from Czech Republic.
Proposed my partner to marry me on this beautiful yacht. The view from room no-5022 was breathtaking as its close to upper-deck, restaurant and bar. Although I would say the tablet inside the room was out of battery needed that charging stand all the time with it otherwise it would switch off completely. This can be addressed of course they would help without hesitation, but it didn't bother us. Room service was great! English breakfast - they forgot to include slice of bread but again it didn't bother us. (if knit picking)
Food at its best hands down and big thanks Chef for baking the engagement cake and excellent 3-course meal.",5,2016,08,16
119,It may have been a luxury yacht but it's certainly no cruise.,"First, beware if booking through Booking.com as I thought I'd searched for bed and breakfast and when this  ""hotel"" came up as luxury bargain, I agreed, so booked for two nights only to discover that breakfast wasn't included. No breakfast is worth the £19.95 Sunborn wanted to charge. £11.50 for a pot of tea and bottled beer was also a bit steep but hey it's London! The service for the latter was also extremely slow.

There was a major problem with the card keys. It took three attempts to get two that worked consistently. As the cards are needed for the crazy lift system as well as the room this proved to be a major annoyance. Rooms cannot be accessed by lift without using the card. The instructions for finding the stairs in case of emergency or if you can't use the lift because the card won't work are woefully inadequate, if not illegal. (We will be taking this up with the proper authorities)

If you can make it as far as the room and you're on the lower deck with a dock view you will discover that is exactly that, not a view of the dock side as opposed to a water scene but the dock wall. (See photo) However as we only wanted to sleep in the room it was only a mild disappointment. More annoying was the noisy and cold air conditioning unit that could not be adjusted or switched off.

On the plus side the room was spacious, comfortable and clean, with tea and coffee making facilities but I expect that of any reasonable hotel let alone one that's described as luxury.
The staff, who were mostly foreign, were excellent. Despite dealing with management failures they were unfailingly polite, helpful and supportive.

The Yacht is well placed for events at the Excel and O2. Transport links are very good with the DLR a five minute walk away and the Emirates Airline cable car ( £3.50 a trip) seven minutes walk to take you to the Greenwich peninsula. Car parking is at the nearby Royal Victoria Car Park (£15 for 24 hours)",3,2016,08,15
119,Amazing stay!,Had a one night stay on Sunborn – amazing! I arrived a bit earlier than check in time (3pm) so sorted the relevant paperwork and handed over my luggage before coming back at 3pm to pick up the room key. Bit of a queue to check in at 3pm but it moved quickly.  Upon check in £40 is deducted from your card and anything you have during your stay will come from this £40 and whatever you do not spend is refunded back to you.  At the bar you just give your room no. and sign once you leave.  My luggage was brought up to my room very quickly. Rooms are lovely with everything you need. Hairdryer/iron and ironing board/coffee machine/bottled water in the fridge/dressing gown and slippers and even mini Molton Brown shampoo/conditioner and shower gel. Breakfast was included in my booking (offer on secret escapes) and was very nice.  Buffet style - full English/fruit/pastries/cereal.  Check out time is 12pm.  We checked out a bit earlier and they were able to store our luggage which we popped back to collect later that afternoon.  Custom House train station is the closest to Sunborn – only a couple of minutes’ walk.  Along with the Excel centre/a Starbucks/a pub and a tapas and Indian restaurant.  Overall a lovely stay and have already recommended to friends and family.,5,2016,08,15
119,Beautiful ,"Stayed for a birthday weekend with my partner. Beautiful yacht in a quiet location a stones throw from the ExCeL. Classy and stylish with a large spacious and luxury clad room. Although our room was on the lower deck and port side it was still a great experience. The in room air conditioning worked beautifully. 

Extras such as the barista style coffee machine were a lovely touch as well as the Molton brown travel toiletries. We did not eat dinner on the yacht but heard very good reviews, however did have room service ordered via an in room tablet to order a pizza during the night which was delicious. 

I would throughly recommend for a lovely romantic weekend getaway in a quirky luxury hotel. ",5,2016,08,15
119,Loved it - Totally Ship Shape!,"Booked the Sunborn as a birthday treat.  Very easy to find from the Excel.  Checked in at 3pm, there was quite a queue to check in but it moved quickly and upon arrival at the reception desk staff were very attentive and welcoming.  Check in was quick and before long we were in our room.  We had an executive room overlooking the dock, perfect view and it was a beautiful sunny day too so that made the view even better.  The room was so spacious and very clean and tidy, some marks on the carpet but that wasn't an issue to us.  Molton Brown products in the bathroom was a lovely touch.  The linen was crisp and white and the bed was huge,  Tea and Coffee making facilities in the room, loved the idea of having a coffee maker in the room.  We had drinks on the sun deck and the staff were very attentive.  Drinks are pricey but then it is London prices.  We didn't have dinner on the boat as we had chosen to eat elsewhere.  We did have breakfast though and I have to say it was one of the best breakfasts I've ever had.  Breakfast is served from 7am to 11am (Saturday) and we were at breakfast for around 8am and we were the only ones in the restaurant, we were given a table overlooking the water and the table was laid out with crisp white linen, drinks order taken straight away and we were informed that breakfast was buffet style and to help ourselves when ready.  Such an excellent range of food, from fresh fruit, cereals, pastries and the usual cooked breakfast, along with facilities to toast your bread.  Staff cleared away the unwanted plates.  I would totally recommend a stay on Sunborn and really hope to return in the not to distant future.",5,2016,08,14
119,Family event  ,A SENSATIONAL EXPERIENCE 5 star all made possible with the 5 star customer service which was lead by MANAGER PETER of the sun born staff    .the engagement under on the hotel had more then 20 people we where fed well.the staff made us feel at home and gave us every opportunity to maximise on the event .,5,2016,08,14
119,Weekend with the kids,"Children had a weekend event at the excel centre, originally booked ibis then changed at last minute, so glad we did, on arrival staff were so friendly, I room wasn't ready at 3 so we were given complimentary champagne and room key was given after only a 10 minute wait.  We had an executive suite with river view and balcony, what a great evening for the kids, so many little cafes and bars around we were spoilt for choice.  The room was clean and very well presented we wouldn't hesitate to stay again",5,2016,08,14
119,Mr kennedy,We had a outstanding stay at this lovely hotel. From a great location getting  around London 15/20 mins back to the south bank. We had a very quick check by Sandra very polite and helpful. The room was great very large and spotless . We had a dock side room and it was very quiet and blackout curtains for a great sleep. We had drinks in the hotel a little expensive but you are in London. We paid extra for breakfast  again the service was outstanding and lots to eat with a lovely view. I would recommend this very unique hotel to everyone and will definitely return again.  ,5,2016,08,14
119,OK for ExCel,"Room was a good size, and clean. Staff were a little unfriendly, a bit disconnected. Probably won't stay again to be honest as nothing really stood out as being good value. Tip: plenty of cafes within walking distance where you can get a decent-priced breakfast.",3,2016,08,14
119,The best place I have ever stayed.,"Stayed here for two nights with breakfast and an evening meal.  There were many restaurants, cafes close to the hotel.  The hotel was only a minute or so walk from the train (DRL) and obviously right on the 02 doorstep.  The room we had was really luxurious.  King size bed with en-suite.  outside balcony.  The bed was really comfortable with mattress toppers for extra comfort.  Facilities in the room were coffee making machine, iron, ironing board, safe, hairdryer, large flat screen tv, tablet, robes and slippers.  The room was of the highest standard and immaculate.  The service in the hotel was second to none.  There was a large bar area and terrace to the back of the yacht with full waiter service and well staffed.  In the main reception area there was always several staff on hand to assist.  The large restaurant area was very well staffed with highly professional waiting staff.  The food was of an excellent standard and reasonable variety. The breakfast was well organised with full English breakfast (can highly recommend the sausages!) cereal, fruits, pastries and breads.  The furnishings in the hotel were lavish and well maintained.  There was a slight problem with checking in but the staff were attentive and dealt with these problems professionally.  A very big Thank you to all the staff at Sunborn that made our stay so memorable.",5,2016,08,14
119,Lovely Stay for a Special Occasion,"We stayed on the Sunborn last week for a night as a birthday treat from friends.
The rooms were lovely and spacious, each with a balcony, some facing the Excel Centre and some over the water. Dressing gowns and slippers provided and there is fridge in the room if you want to take your own refreshments.
Bar a little bit pricey, but as it was a special occasion and a beautiful sunny day, so we sat on the deck having a drink. Bar open till 1am.
Did not eat on the yacht as it is moored very close to a number of restaurants and the Emerites cable cars, so we went over to the O2 to eat. Fares on the cable car reasonable £9 an adult and £4.50 children, but if you have an Oyster card or day return ticket, you get a discount. Views good going over in daylight, but much better coming back at night.
Another lovely day the next morning so had breakfast on the deck, which was lovely.
Prices go up at the weekend.
City airport very close so noisy during the day with planes taking off, but did not hear them at night.
Only disappointing thing was the en suite, looked very clean but very bad musty smell. Would still recommend.",4,2016,08,14
119,Expected excellence. Didn't quite match expectations.,"We booked through the Groupon deal for Dinner, B&B. For this you got main course, a balconied Exec room and breakfast. 

The room was excellent and very clean, except for some marks on the light carpet and nicks out of some of the woodwork. Air conditioned and very quiet. 

Check in was very slow, with quite a queue even though 3 receptionists were working hard - they said it was due to the computer running slowly. 

We had booked one room but for some reason they had reserved two for us. Easily sorted but worrying. Also having already confirmed I wanted the river view when I booked they asked if Wanted a river view - extra 20 GBP so I wonder how good the booking system is. 

We had booked a table for dinner and as it was a special occasion we were told we would be given a nice table. On arriving we were told we had a table for four - no we booked for two. Quick look around to find that 'nice' table, but we were parked somewhere in the middle of the restaurant. Very disappointing. 

One of the waiters was very helpful, very attentive and to be honest made the evening more enjoyable. We liked the relaxed atmosphere and chatting between guests and waiting staff. 

I was comparing the food to that of the Laura Ashley hotel where we stayed recently. To be honest I think having dinner included in the deal but it only including the main course feels a bit tight. Starters started at about 8 GBP and a cheeseboard was 12 GBP so it soon adds up.  I didn't think the food lived up to the Laura Ashley restaurant for price, taste or presentation and to be really honest I have had better in business class on long-haul flights.

There is a nice sun-deck aft but the staff were not very attentive and we sat there for some time without being noticed and eventually left without having a drink. Bizarrely we were then challenged on the way out in case we had had anything and needed to sign for it! Chance would have been a fine thing. 

The top deck was closed for a private party, ironically for Premiere Inns, who clearly know where and where not to celebrate. 

Breakfast was a real disappointment. The white tablecloths of dinner get replaced with wipe clean mats and bare tables. On arrival we were told the restaurant was full and were seated in an overflow room that had no atmosphere and was sterile. There were plenty of available tables in the restaurant but some had not been cleared. It would have been better to ask if we wanted to wait or to be placed in the overflow area, rather than being ushered like second class citizens into steerage! We did complain and were moved back to the main restaurant and views over London. 

Even though breakfast is almost 100% self-service the staff didn't seem able to keep on top of refilling the buffet or in getting a cup of tea as we had to ask three times. 

So on balance, a nice treat for the Groupon price and we will be going back (at normal rates) with the family - though will probably eat at one of the many waterside bars and restaurants nearby.  

I have actually booked four rooms later in the year, though I am disappointed that for the price I will only be getting classic rooms with no breakfast. 

I didn't find the website helpful when trying to sort out car parking. For those travelling by car, there is a taxi drop-off point about 30 yards from the hotel and parking in the Excel car park at 15 GBP for 24 hours. It does not require pre-booking and the machines take cash and cards. I would drive to the first floor parking as near to the entrance as possible, then walk through Excel and down to the ship. There are stairs and ramps if needed. 

London City Airport is nearby so planes taking off in the direction of London can be a bit noisy but this is short lived.",4,2016,08,12
119,"Enjoy Your Stay, but Be Sure to Leave Nothing Behind","My husband and I loved every minute of our stay at this property, which happened to coincide with the hottest day of 2016 thusfar in London. Our room was luxuriously comfortable and cool, we had a lovely view (though of the pedestrian area, not the River) and the meal (included in the price of our stay) was absolutely scrumptious.

We were warmly greeted on arrival, complete with glasses of cool water to drink while we checked in. We enjoyed the amenities of the room and were greeted promptly when we went to dinner at the on-board restaurant. Despite being in the flight path for London City AIrport, we heard *nothing* in our room and had a comfortable, cool night's sleep (something I'm sure we wouldn't have had at home). Breakfast was also quite nice, and also included in the price of our stay.

Upon checkout, I asked where I should have our taxi come for us, since regular traffic does not come right up to the yacht (except for deliveries, it would appear) and received helpful and friendly advice as to how to go about getting transport.

The only problem I had, and it is a vexing one given how positive everything else was, was that I accidentally left a small item behind. It wasn't valuable, thankfully, but it wasn't free, either, and it will take me a little while to replace it (not due to cost, but due to how I found it in the first place). I immediately wrote to the hotel upon my return home and discovery of the loss, and received a response that they were ""looking into"" the matter. That was on July 20. I have heard nothing since, despite two follow-up emails on my part. Not even a notification that the item was never found and an offer of small recompense. I'm very disappointed in this. I realize I should have been more careful in scanning the room upon departure, but I can't be the first person who has ever left a small item behind on check-out. There really has to be more suitable assistance when such a (hopefully rare) event occurs.",4,2016,08,12
119,Birthday Stay,"Stayed here back in March for my husbands 40th. Purchased a deal via Groupon which included a meal, massage & breakfast. 
Such a great hotel! We checked in early & reception were happy to take our bags whilst we went round London. Once we arrived back and were given our key we found that we had been upgraded to a suite! Wow, it was AMAZING!!! Such a gorgeous room with a huge balcony.
As I said, dinner was included in the deal and the choice was great. Every course was delicious! We went for a drink in the bar area after, nice chilled atmosphere. 
Breakfast the next morning was, again, delicious. Good variety.
The massage was lovely too. Nice and relaxing.
Overall we had a fantastic stay here and would definitely go back. ",4,2016,08,12
119,"Found it 2nd time round, don't drive there! Use the train ....","After a failed attempt to find the Royal docks , getting stuck in traffic for 6 hours before deciding another 3 hrs till we would arrive would finish us off due to heavy traffic in central London, we sadly turned home tired and hungry. After a call to the hotel to explain this and we were told due to it being groupon, we couldn't change the day. I was very upset as it was our 5 year anniversary and my upset turned to anger as it was fully paid for 4 months in advance . We did receive a call back from a lovely lady whom honoured our booking and offered us another date which we gladly accepted. We have just arrived home after a lovely stay , and so glad we went. The lands end restaurant was really nice, and the salmon was cooked to perfection. I had the wild mushroom with butternut squash with a poached duck egg.. It was delicious . The service was excellent , maybe a bit to excellent as my husband felt he was being watched, but the girls were lovely. The desert was the best I've ever tasted. Chocolate parfait.. Out if this world. 

The hotel room was overlooking the river, the aeroplanes from city airport kept my husband amused !! He loved watching them so close. But the noise was blocked by excellent Windows when they  were shut.

The room was clean and tidy, the water was complimentary in the rooms mini bar. 
Bed was very comfortable.

All in all I'd stay again. 

Thank you for a nice break away and offering us another date. Very much appreciated .",4,2016,08,11
119,Fabulous break away!,"Booked this fab hotel as an anniversary treat for my husband and I.  It did not disappoint from getting the lift to the reception floor.
Old world glamour and the biggest chandelier taking centre stage with the curving staircase around it. Polite service at check-in.
Our room was great, a small suite, looking out towards excel from the balcony. Dinner in the restaurant was lovely, despite a power cut, it was a lovely experience.  This was reflected in an extremely  reduced bill. Super king bed was extremely comfortable, air con so the room was just the right temperature. Nice big fluffy bathtowels and robes,  no complaints whatsoever! In all a fabulous experience  and will definitely go again. Next time would book a riverview.",5,2016,08,11
119,Loved this Boat Hotel,It was a perfect gift and way to spend an evening. We had a meal inside the yacht and then went into london to watch a show. This is a fabulous place to stay. We had a very nice room and a lovely view of the Thames. It's quite pricey for drinks and food but it's a one off experience.,5,2016,08,11
119,Love it here,"Second time here. Just love the quirkiness of being on a yacht hotel. Rooms are spacious. Would always opt for riverside balcony for fresh air and privacy reasons. Bed is so comfy and loads of storage space. Fridge in the room which is restocked with water and of course Molton brown toiletries which we love anyway. Agree with other reviewers about slow bar service but we bypass that by going to bars on the doorstep. Love that there are many places to eat a few minutes walk away. There is a tesco express a few minutes walk away too. 

Staff are very friendly and helpful. Surroundings feel luxurious and clean. There is air con in the bedrooms and blackout curtains for a good nights sleep. Very quiet at night. 

We wonder why the hotel doesn't provide wine and water glasses in the room, there is a cocktail cabinet in rooms but is empty. 

",5,2016,08,11
119,Overpriced for the Service,"we stayed at during August, Its a good hotel but the decor is very blingy and very outdated and gives a feeling of a left behind Yacht of an Arab Sheikh/Oil Baron or Russian Oligarch. Too much Golden and Formeaca Wood decor very outdated. The views are very good from Balcony Exec Rooms, However, when we stayed there the electricity was out for good few hours, which put a dent in our stay as no lifts were in operations, The Staff at the reception, bar and resturant did not have good customer service skills, they never offered us any complimentary stuff for the inconvinience that we had because of no electricity. The towels in the bathroom had stains on it and the bathrobe had holes !!!!! The staff spoke english but were not helpful and had a strange attitude for employees to work in Hospitality business, very slow service at the bar, and deck of the restaurant is no go areas for people staying there, I would not stay there again,  It was ok for an experience but overpriced I would recommend looking for secret sales for this hotel and dont pay the overpriced rooms !",3,2016,08,11
119,Slightly deflated,"I was super excited to visit this hotel, it has gorgeous surroundings but it is lacking somewhat and I was left feeling disappointed. Hotel staff were slow to take orders on the bar and told both my boyfriend and his dad that they would come to the table to take our order and 10 minutes later we were still waiting. The bathroom had stained towels and bath mat, and a foul smell whenever the taps were ran which made me heave.

Like I said beautiful hotel, lots of potential but lacking somewhat.",4,2016,08,10
119,Very enjoyable stay,"Stayed at the Sunborn on the 7th August  with family the staff were  friendly and welcomed us and checked us in quickly taking time to explain things. Enjoyed having drinks on the terrace as the weather was good, our room was spacious clean with comfy
Bed and soft towels. Food was very good. Looking to book again",5,2016,08,10
119,Birthday & Wedding Anniversary,"After a hectic day sightseeing in London it was a pleasure to walk into the calm,inviting entrance of the Sunborn Yacht. We were greeted by Vadim, the receptionist,who was extremely helpful and friendly. The accommodation was excellent and we had a very relaxing evening. We ate in the restaurant which had great views over Canary Wharf and the O2. Food was good but not outstanding. The location is perfect for the Excel exhibition centre and the O2 but to get back into the centre of London you have to take the DLR. We walked to the Emirates Royal Dock and took the cable car to the O2. We would certainly stay again.",5,2016,08,10
119,Disappointing service,"Struggled with entering hotel ( entrance by lift only ) know one available to show use of system ? On entering reception appeared to take for granted that you knew your way to rooms & remained behind reception desk until they realised I was getting frustrated with reception attitude. Breakfast staff seemed to be surprised at the arrival of guests for dining, when asked for table for 4 instructed ( not requested ) to wait in waiting area ?? until called, although tables available but not cleaned, finally had two tables for 2 which were not together as requested. Breakfast, no hashbrowns, sausage & bacon containers empty, these were requested, eventually gave up on hashbrowns as bacon & sausage was now going cold, wife could not locate marmalade, this was requested, after 10 minutes I walked to marmalade area, this had been restocked but we had not been informed ?? Overall for such a venue & cost it was terrible breakfast experience.",3,2016,08,09
119,Fab hotel,"I had a fantastic stay at the Sunborn London. I stayed here so while at a conference at the Excel (2 min walk away). The location was excellent, just a stones throw from where I needed to be and not much further from the closest DLR station (Custom House).
The entrance to the hotel is spectacular and the rooms where very spacious. 
The only annoying thin about the hotel is that there are only 2 lifts - and you can only enter / exit the hotel from the left - i often had to wait a while for one to be going in the right direction to let me out!",5,2016,08,09
119,Worth a stay,"The Sunborn is very easy to get to on the DLR and less than a minutes walk from the ExCel centre. 
The staff were helpful but very busy. Some guests are more needy than others. 
The hotel/ship was clean, and came across fairly luxurious. Certainly the prices cater for a more upmarket scene. I booked via secret escapes, for a big discount, a spa treatment, and breakfast. The package was easily worth the price. However I would be loath to say it would be worth paying the full value. 
The room was clean, and the bed comfortable. There were plenty of amenities in the room, such as tea, coffee, bottled water, slippers, soaps etc. The shower had great pressure and the bathroom floor seemed heated. The downsides were the air con seemed to be stuck on so the room was cold all the time. There was also a rattle as the vibration of the ship caused a glass cupboard door to vibrate all night. My wife didn't sleep well as a consequence. 
The room came with a balcony, but the view of ExCel (the dock) is underwhelming. I expect the view across the river is better. 
The spa was very relaxing and a welcome perk of staying. But my favourite part was breakfast. Lots of options, in making a full English, or Continental breakfast. 
I would stay again. ",4,2016,08,09
119,A great stay,"We stayed here for six nights as a family and really enjoyed it. So nice coming back to a spacious comfortable room in the evening after spending the day walking round London.
We'd booked a basic room but I had emailed in advance to ask whether we could have a river view so we were delighted to find that we had a room with a view of the Thames.  Our son thought it was really cool to see people swimming past the window on the Sunday morning!
We found the desk/housekeeping staff to be polite and pleasant.
We'd certainly go back there again.",5,2016,08,09
119,Absolute disgrace,"Arrived to be told there was no electricity.  We had come to London for my daughters 18th birthday and couldn't even check into our room at 6pm never mind 3pm. 
We had a restaurant booked for 8pm and ended up not going because we couldn't even get checked into our room...never mind a shower and get ready.
Staff knew about this planned power cut in advance but no guests were informed until arrival and then it was made out they didn't know but after a couple of hours one of the reception staff admitted it was a pre planned health and safety power cut.
There plan was to ply everyone with free drinks and think everything would be ok, but for us our daughters 18th was ruined.
Bar staff smirked at us when we were complaining and one male behind reception told me it only would take him 5 minutes to get ready so I shouldn't take any longer. Just one pure idiot that had no customer service skills what so ever.  
We were able to check in by 7.30pm. 4 and a half hours later than planned.
Once in the room it was nice enough but no signage directing you to any exits to enable you to get out.
We ended up not paying for our room due to the total incompetence of the service that was meant to be provided.
I would have rather have stayed in a travelodge than be so let down by the sunborn yacht hotel.
Your daughters 18th birthday happens once in a lifetime. Sunborn ruined that for ourselves and our family.
Never again.",1,2016,08,08
119,Excellent Sunborn LOndon,We have just spent an excellent evening on board the Sunborn yacht. This is a must stay in London.. Staff are excellent. Food in the restaurant is very good and the river view room we had was one of the best we have stayed in while in London.We would highly recommend staying at the Sunborn yacht hotel.,5,2016,08,08
119,Afternoon Tea Birthday Treat,My daughter treated me to afternoon tea at the Sunborn.  From the outside it is a very impressive yacht and on entering I was impressed with the lovely staircase and decor. The restaurant was well laid out - tables arranged well so you were not overlooking others. We had a lovely table looking out onto the outdoor decking area and a view towards the O2 and Emirates Air Line. The tea was served on a lovely porthole shaped stand and all looked fresh and inviting. We were well attended to by our server. This was a really lovely venue and a very good tea. I would definitely come here again.,5,2016,08,08
119,"Great time on Sunborn, London.","Very nice service, very nice to sleep on a boat in London. 
Staff was great to me. Room with balcony and very nice when you sit there and holiday people make pictures from the boat (with you). 
Will come soon to my new home in London and for sure i book Sunborn again.
Looking forward to it.",5,2016,08,08
119,Sink or Swim the Receptionist Sank,"Nice hotel but the reception staff need to brush up on their customer service skills Unfortunately the restaurant was fully booked but the staff shouldnt say "" If you wanted to dine with us this evening you cannot because its fully booked."" At least apologise and offer some alternatives in the local area. ",3,2016,08,07
119,Package overnight stay,"I stayed in this hotel with my girlfriend as a final night after three previous nights in the bustling City of London. 
The first impression is simply stunning. The hotel is situated 2 minutes walk from the Excel Custom House station and there is plenty of convenience stores and a few bars/restaurants nearby. 
We booked an Executive Room with dinner, breakfast and a 25 minute massage each within the Spa. On arrival we were moved to a river view room, which was much appreciated, where we could chill on our balcony and enjoy the view and peacefulness - something seldom found in London city centre accommodation. 
This, in itself, leads onto the first issue some might have. The hotel is around 45minutes away from the city centre (i.e. Covent Garden etc) with 3/4 changes depending on destination. It is also in Zone 3 of the Underground map leading to increased costs for travel. So if you are planning a stay to explore London's tourist attractions then I wouldn't recommend this hotel. If you are planning to stay at the end of a trip for relaxation purposes then I would. 
The yacht is very relaxing other than one (major) fault. The yacht is situated directly under London City Airport's main runway. No exaggeration when I say that every 5 minutes during 4pm-9pm a plane passes over the yacht producing a noise so loud you can't hear the person sitting a metre away from you. 
I must concede that the frequency decreases as the night progresses, however, it is still an irritating noise. 
Moving onto food; the breakfast is as good as I've had at hotels across the country, matched only by the Fairmont Hotel chain. The dinner was overly priced in my opinion for what you got but the food itself was cooked perfectly and I appreciated the waiting staff explaining how the chef suggests you order your food. 
On check-out (12pm) we eagerly awaited our massages before the travel home to Scotland only to be informed we could not get them as the spa was fully booked. This was very disappointing as I had already paid for these a week previous. The two massages would cost £84 from the hotel's brochure and as compensation for their inability to accommodate us we were offered one bottle of house wine (£30 on menu; probably costing the hotel itself <£10 to buy). For me this was a slap on the face and really left me with a sour taste in my mouth. No refund or acceptable compensation was offered as we booked with a package from another company. Now starts the long process of trying to recuperate the cost of the spa from both the company we booked with and the Sunborn group. 
In conclusion, I would recommend this hotel for anyone staying in London for purposes regarding the far East of the City or for an experience of relaxing luxury. I would also suggest that you book any extras within your stay incl. dinner 4 weeks in advance (this is what the reception staff said to me which is ludicrous in my opinion). ",3,2016,08,07
119,Beautiful hotel on a yacht.  I was amazed at the size of the room.,"This was an amazing experience.  The manager was awesome.  We had a room with a balcony.  The room was extremely large, clean, and very modern. The food was excellent and the drinks were comparably priced, given it is in London.  Damien was a perfect host and got us checked in quickly. We had not made a reservation, we were at the excel center for the Star Wars experience, and ended up staying late and didn't want to drive back home that late.  I cannot say enough about this hotel, you will love it.",5,2016,08,07
119,"Great room, comfy bed, amazing view!","Stayed for one night after visiting the excel centre next door. Room was clean, comfortable and had a fantastic view of the 02 and the city. I'd read reviews that the food was a bit pricey so we took a picnic to eat in the room. 
Very peaceful nights sleep in a comfortable bed. Would highly recommend but make sure you get an executive room with a balcony and river view- totally worth a little extra £££
",4,2016,08,06
119,Sunborn Yacht Hotel,Looks great from the outside but really just a gimmick. Mediocre breakfasts because they were cold. Excellent room. Excellent service. Difficult to get anywhere except by Docklands Light Railway or a cable car (no good if you don't like heights.Parking a short distance away but if it raining expect to get wet because you can't drive close.,4,2016,08,06
119,A Chrome-Plated Containment Zone,"Looks great from the outside, but once inside you're trapped! I had to have my card keys reset four times in 36 hours - requiring me to walk back and forth to/from the room through two sets of electronic doors and an elevator system which would only work if the key cards did!

Nice idea was a tablet in the room chained to the wall from which guests can order breakfast online - except that didn't work either. 

Nothing on draft in the bar, which is table service only - which meant an extended wait for everything. Although booked into the hotel, I was not permitted to eat in the restaurant (fully booked both nights I was there), and was told I could get basic snacks in the bar (croque monsieur and chips), served by a coterie of well-meaning and almost-competent Europeans, who appeared to have been well trained in bland apologies. 

I also wonder how you are meant to get out of this hotel quickly if there's power outage or a fire - it can't be easy when trapped on a lower deck by two sets of electric doors and a card-triggered elevator - which worked one time out of four. The windows/portholes are sealed shut, and the only other exit appeared to be a single gangplank - at the other end of the ship...

Final straw was that I was obliged to haul my baggage about 150 yds from the hotel entrance because taxis cannot get to the entrance - and no offer of assistance from the staff despite requesting - luckily for me it wasn't raining the day I thankfully checked out. 

I will not visit this hotel again and do not recommend it.",2,2016,08,05
119,Wow!!!,"This place is great! The hotel don't have its own parking so it's best to park at royal Victoria car park which is next to crowne plaza, for £15 for 24 hours, and it's only 5min walk to Sunborn Hotel,
On arrival we were greeted nicely and the kind lady delivered drinks to our room at the exact time we asked for. The room was clean, bed was perfect we had a nice view of the dock. We had to wait for breakfast because all tables were full but once we were seated the breakfast was very nice. One thing I was really impressed with was all the staff were full of smiles, the receptionists, waiters, cleaners were all very nice and very helpful! Can't wait to come back!!!",4,2016,08,05
119,Excellent visit ,"We have just returned from a fantastic stay here. The gentleman who checked us in on reception was very friendly and professional. It was my dads birthday and we all received a complimentary glass of champagne, a very nice touch. The Yacht itself is immaculate. The rooms are very comfortable. Ignore the negative comments. Cannot wait to return.",5,2016,08,05
119,Great place to stay,"We stayed for one night recently, cannot fault the accommodation, location or staff attitude, we had one small issue that the staff dealt with immediately and helpfully.
This is a really unique place to stay and we loved it.  I really do not understand the negative reviews so don't be put off.  We will definitely be return guests.",5,2016,08,05
119,Birthday treat,Would definitely recommend. The rooms are big and the bed comfy. Lovely food champagne on arrival. Staff friendly. Easy upgrade. Very quiet so enables a good night sleep. Beautiful decor. Restaurants and shops nearby. Most rooms have River Thames view. Defo going back 👍🏽 ,5,2016,08,04
119,"Great, unique stay","Had a fab stay at the Sunborn recently as a birthday treat bought as part of an Internet deal. Was disappointed to read some negative points in the reviews prior to going but none of the points made seemed to be justified. The beds were very comfy (the mattresses seemed to be thin, but we had an excellent night sleep and were very cosy) and the linen was clean but not too squeaky clean or starched like some other hotels. The toiletries were just what was needed for a one night stay and the room was decorated with what we felt was classic 'boat' style with wood but this added to the feel; modern decor would have seemed out of place. We stayed in an executive room with dockside view but the bar had a fab view of the docks, the o2 and Canary Wharf. We ate only breakfast but that was lovely with lots of choice. Drinks were a little on the steep side but it is London so prices were not out of place. All staff were lovely, attentive and very friendly. All in all we had a wonderful stay and didn't want to leave! 

As it was a week day, we drove around the m25 and into the east side of London to avoid congestion charge and parked in the Excel east. Cost £15 per 24 hours and was handy to have somewhere to drop our luggage back to the morning we checked out. Was just around the corner with easy access to the DLR to get into central London. We also ventured to the o2 for dinner using the cable cars as an added extra which was a short walk from the boat. There were also restaurants the same side of the river had we chosen to go to one of them. 

Thank you for an impressive and unique stay in an excellent location! ",5,2016,08,04
119,Heaven and Hell,"What a fantastic location! We LOVED the room, it really did feel like being on a luxurious yacht. We could have sat all night just looking at the view and pretending we were on the ocean. 
The whole experience was let down by the service and the breakfast. 
We stayed at the Sunborn for the soft opening when again we loved the room but found they did not have their act together to serve breakfast. No one seemed to know what they were doing, they kept running out of dishes ( even basics like butter and jam) and the service was VERY slow. We put it down to just opening and because we loved the bedroom and the idea of being on a yacht so much, we decided to go back many months later and give them another chance to impress us. 
Sadly, the service had not improved at all. Breakfast was agony, again, slow and running out of many dishes.
We will NOT be giving them a third chance. Someone who knows how to train staff needs to take charge to improve the service .
Sunborn have lots going for it, location, accommodation but until they sort out the service problems, they will continue to have dissatisfied customers.",3,2016,08,04
119,Unusual & Unique Hotel!,"""Yacht Hotel"" is very unique and unusual place to stay! 
The location is nice with good transportation. The room is clean and has enough space  but the mattress of the bed is so thin, mostly like a duvet only.... It is really not a good type of bed to sleep....😟
The restaurant is nice and the bar as well. Staff are kind and friendly especially the staff in the bar. ",5,2016,08,03
119,Feeling disgust,"I've booked to stayed with my husband in July sadly my husband suddenly past away with funeral arrangements and greif I totally forgot to cancel..sunborn took 198£   cancelation fee when I spoke to them to explain my situation they ask me to send death certificate to prove I'm not lying.. What!. However I've sent it only to be told they can't refund me as the certificate dated 8th June 2016,I've only got my husband laid to rest on 8th July 2016..sunborn decide they can't give me refund as my husband death is not recent... Omg..what an insult to myself our kids/family and my late husband....disgust I am..",1,2016,08,03
119,Great Place to stay.,"We booked a short break and I must say this is great place to stay. The staff are really friendly and helpful. On arrival in London we had to get the tube then the Docklands Light  Railway. You get off at Custom House station which is then a 10 min walk to the hotel. The Yacht is moored in a dock right next to the Excel Arena. The Hotel is spotlessly clean and the food was great. We had an evening meal booked with our package and there was 4 of us in our party. Unfortunately if you do not pre book the evening meal prior to arrival you may not all be given the same time slot especially if the restaurant is fully booked as we found out. We had a 6 pm booking and the other couple a 10 pm booking as the hotel was extremely busy. This was quickly sorted and we we where able to eat together in the bar area and order off the restaurant menu. The breakfast was great and had plenty of choice and was constantly stocked with everything freshly cooked. The drinks are fairly expensive but what do you expect as this no different to the majority of hotels anywhere. 
There are plenty of bars and restaurants within a short 5 min walk in any direction. 
We had a executive room that faced the dock with an outside balcony. The room was extremely clean with plenty of room and storage space. There is coffee and tea making facilities. There is also an iron and ironing board that folds up and hangs in the wardrobe.The bed was really comfortable and we all slept well. 
The area is fairly quite but it was a Sunday night when we stayed, but just a short walk along the dock there are plenty of bars restaurants and places eat if you just want to grab something on the go. You are also really close to the Excel arena and if you walk in the other direction you come to the Emirates cable car that takes you over the dock and Thames to the O2 Arena with fantastic panoramic views all over London. When you arrive at the 02 you will find numerous bars and restaurants within the 02 Arena. Check times though as your  return on the cable car may not run late at night.
Location is great, as we all felt we where well out of the hussel and bustle of London, but close enough to jump on the DLR and then the underground and get to anywhere in London.  
We all loved it and would defiantly return to the Sunbourn as there is still loads to do and see and this is a great place to base yourself during your stay.",5,2016,08,03
119,Fantastic hotel for special occasion,"Wonderful time spent at Sunborn Hotel thanks to Anton.  We booked for our 25th Anniversary and 50th Birthday celebration but had a few issue but as soon as we bought these to Anton the Managers attention he was more than happy to upgrade our room and wow!! what an upgrade, we had a fantastic suite with sauna, twin showers, jacuzzi bath and lounge area, it was superb, would highly recommend this suite for a treat.  Wonderful stay celebrated with champagne in the room.  Lovely staff very clean hotel.",5,2016,08,03
119,Definitely 5* plus accommodation,"We stayed for just one night but wish it could've been longer and without a doubt we will definitely return.  We were a little hesitant initially particularly concerning safety.  We did not need to worry every aspect of our stay was superb.  Our room was one of the best we've had, breakfast was excellent too. Unfortunately we did not have time to use the restaurant, instead we ate at one of the many restaurants adjacent to the Yacht.  We will, as I said earlier definitely return.",5,2016,08,03
119,Good but dinner overpriced ,We stayed here as a treat having spotted it online. It's a great idea to have a hotel as a ship but try and get a cabin that faces the river otherwise your view is of the ExCel arena which isn't quite as good. A really nice night away but the dinner menu is overpriced for what it is. I don't mind a bit of nouveau cuisine but I was so starving after my main I had to invest £12 in the cheese board to avoid going to bed hungry. I'd go again but would probably dine elsewhere. ,3,2016,08,03
119,great family weekend,"We had an awesome weekend wandering around and enjoying London.  It was a novelty to stay on the Sunborn which gave a different perspective of the area.

All the staff were spectacular and interacted with the children as well as the adults.  Maryiam on reception was particularly attentive to our family but I can not fault any of the staff",5,2016,08,03
119,Fantastic ,"Had a fantastic night at the sun born , the night was arranged for my birthday. Beautiful meal , staff were first class . Rooms are excellent. Can't wait to stay again . Not the sort of hotel you expect to find in London . Absolutely amazing all round . ",5,2016,08,03
119,Anniversary treat,A huge thank you to Anton The Manager for arranging a luxury upgrade and champagne after we experienced a few problems this made our Anniversary stay a memorable one.  Would thoroughly recommend this hotel for a special occasion and would recommend the 3 course set menu deal and room with a river view,4,2016,08,03
119,Wow!,"The yacht looks spectacular on arrival, you enter into a lift which takes you straight up to the 3rd floor reception where you're greeted by a really friendly, efficient team.
We had booked a suite & the receptionist was proud to tell us we had the best room on board and wanted to know what we were celebrating.
The suite was located at the front of the yacht and is totally a wow room! So huge, a hallway, lounge & then the doors open onto the deck where you literally have the entire front of the yacht to yourselves. If the sun is shining be sure to pack your bikini as there are 2 loungers to catch the rays.  Flat screen TV's in lounge & bedroom (which is an ample size) but the bathroom is totally amazing! Double showers/wet room, a large jacuzzi and a full size sauna room! 
Everything else you would expect at your disposal is also catered for: hairdryers, toiletries, robes, iron/ board/ safe, Lavazza coffee machine.
Bar area is nice enough if a little corporate feeling, but good choice of cocktails and nice music throughout. 
The restaurant again was nice enough, feels a little corporate hotel, but food was of a good standard if a little rushed by overly keen staff, lovely view after dark. ",4,2016,08,02
119,"Wonderful ""micro-break""","Checked in after having a lovely lunch in the hotel's restaurant (Land's End).....great value set menu. Hotel willingly upgraded us to a river-view suite as a result of an electrical fault in the bathroom of our executive dockside room. We were disappointed to find a limited selection of toiletries given the high standard of accommodation, but really enjoyed the spacious suite with lovely furnishings & bathroom.",4,2016,08,02
119,Beautiful Hotel,"I am currently staying at this hotel and thoroughly enjoying myself. The decor an ambience are superb.  The best thing about my stay so far has got to be the staff. They are attentive supportive and very professional with a capital P.  i found my room cold and contacted the staff initially two members of staff arrived at my room and activated my heating.  I then became warm and tried to turn it down only to make my room cold again!!!,  I contacted reception who i admitted my mistake and he rectified it with a deploram I admired.  Three staff members who I must mention for their attentiveness are Ramint, Rasa and Indre.  I want to say a big thank you for your assistance. There was nothing to big or small for any of you and I really appreciated your attentiveness.  Tonight i will be trying the restaurant, lets see how that goes?  Judging from my first night....... I am looking forward!!!",4,2016,08,02
119,"Excellent staff, service and beautiful and clean hotel with an amazing river view of London",My husband and I stayed at the yacht and hosted dinner for our wedding. The staff ensured our special day was memorable by paying attention to details and even upgrading our room and banquet hall for free! The food was amazing and the room was breathtaking with beautiful river view. We thoroughly enjoyed our day and our friends were more than impressed with the dinner and venue. Special thanks for the staff who made it happen - especially Meri! Thank you so much Sunborn xx,5,2016,08,02
119,Underwhelming,"I recently stayed here with my wife for our anniversary and had paid a fair amount of money which on first appearances seemed well spent. 
The ship is impressive from the outside and is in a good location despite the air traffic noise (stops over night though). 
Once on board I was surprised to see the interior didn't match the modern exterior and was more of a classic style.  This isn't a bad thing, just wasn't what I had expected.  
We waited to check in and struggled to understand the receptionist through her accent (as we did most staff we met). She couldn't get hold of the restaurant to book us a table despite realising a few moments later that she was calling someone about ten feet away.  
They gave us a free upgrade which turned out to be the suite I'd booked in the first place.  
When trying to find our room it wasn't listed anywhere in the corridor numbers and after we'd asked a non English speaking staff member we found it.  
The room itself was nice, large and pretty well equipped with a lovely balcony view over the dock and water.  
The bed was a good size and decent and the tv's were great despite being too dark to see some stuff and not being allowed to change the brightness through the remote.  
There was a mini bar that was empty accept for a bottle or two of water and no welcome pack. 
Instead there was a tablet device which we presumed was there for ordering room service etc.  
I wanted a bottle of champagne for the room but the tablet hadn't been charged and wouldn't turn on. 
My wife called multiple times to either get the tablet sorted or to just get a menu delivered to our room.  
Nearly two hours later it turned up by which point I didn't order out of principle.  
So we went to the bar before our meal for a quick drink.  
The sun terrace is lovely and would have been better had I not had to fetch my own drinks menu (it's supposed to be table service) and then flag down a waiter to take our order.  We'd waited a good twenty minutes and lots of other people around us had been served already.  
The drinks are hellishly expensive at £5 for a bottle of peroni, £8 for a single whisky and coke, £8 for a glass of wine etc.  
We had a three course meal which was fine.  Some parts of it were great, others were pretty average but the service was good.  
We had a massage as well, there is just a couple of rooms for this so don't expect to turn up early and relax as they wont let you in.  We were whisked into different rooms, pummelled by an angry woman for half and hour and booted out pretty quickly.  

This hotel is lovely, unfortunately it wasn't up to the five star service I'd paid for and overall I was really disappointed.  
I'm hopeful that my experience was against the norm but I wouldn't stay here again. ",3,2016,08,02
119,My 50th birthday ,"Amazing place to stay 😃 my daughter got me this trip with her & my mum for my 50th 😃 we had the balcony room which was amazing with the best views of the city & river,breakfast was brilliant too,so we're all the staff they all actually give the feeling that they enjoy being in work 😃😃 last night we went on the United emirates skyline over to the 02 arena which is a must.",5,2016,08,02
119,Excellent Stay,"Stayed for one night whilst sight seeing.The staff were extremely helpful and the room was clean, spacious and very comfortable.  The riverside view was lovely and we really enjoyed our stay. We would certainly recommend this for a special holiday.No complaints at all.",5,2016,08,01
119,Average,"I am always looking to stay somewhere 'a bit different' and booked this for our anniversary.  Was really looking forward to it. The entrance is lovely and staff helpful.  The room was quite average though.  After requesting a high deck room, we were put on the bottom floor.  After reading Molton Brown was supplied, I was disappointed to find one tiny bottle of shampoo and that was it.  There were no robes in the room, which I would expect as standard here!  The hair dryer is locked in the bathroom and not transferrable.  Therefore, after showering, and the bathroom steaming up, I was unable to dry my hair - of course you cannot open a window to allow ventilation.  Silly things, but important really.  The carpet was stained and after paying an extra £90 for the romantic package, we arrived to a very nice rose petal display, but 4 chocolates only and a bottle of Prosecco. Not £90 worth of spoiling!  We didn't eat on the boat due to being advised the food weren't All that so went up the steps to Tapa Tapa, which made the night!  Overall, a nice evening away from the kids, but not worthy of the price - done it, but wouldn't book again.  Excellent location though.",3,2016,08,01
119,Amazingly Nice Place & Location,"The location is Fabulous, the Ship is immaculately decorated and clean throughout.
The rooms were very spacious.
Regret I was ill the Majority of our stay so did not do as much or see as much of the Ship or surrounding area as would have hoped.
The reception staff were very attentive and always offering assistance.",5,2016,08,01
119,Birhday,"I booked on Groupon for my husbands birthday and upgraded to a suite as he
Loves saunas the room was lovely the fridge only had two small bottles of water
We went down to bar ordered a cocktail which took 20 mins and they wernt that
Busy in the evening table was not ready not a big deal didn't have to wait to long
We were shown to our table given menus waited and waited no eye contact to ask 
Us what we would like to drink I just feel that customer care should be number 1
Just get staff to look at all times perhaps allocate staff for three tables so they focus
and give first class service i paid £450 one night 
which is quite a bit and just felt a little dissapointed as we travel a lot and stay in luxury accomadation and have good service little things mean a lot perhaps front desk could
ask would you like a paper in morning come on sunborn turn it around a bit.",3,2016,08,01
119,"Lovely hotel, service and food","We had a lovely suite with balcony. Everything was spotless and gleaming. The food was fantastic, portions large. I had the lamb and got 2 steaks. We had Lovely weather and it was great drinking wine on the balcony. Staff were very friendly and their was a great atmosphere.",5,2016,08,01
119,Been Three Times,"I have been to the Sunborn Yachet 3 times, the first time I had the lunch menu and the other times I had afternoon tea. The last time I attended was for a friends birthday, we were treated very highly and I can say that the service was impeccable. Would highly recommend this for anyone celebrating something special as you feel like royalty.",5,2016,08,01
119,Friendly and something different,"My boyfriend surprised me with a visit to the sunborn hotel for our 3 year anniversary. When we arrived the staff were helpful and friendly and when we got to our room they had gone that little bit extra and written a hand not congratulating us on our anniversary and hoping we would enjoy our stay. We couldn't get dinner reservations in the restaurant as it was fully booked so we are in the bar on the deck, me being vegetarian the bar menu wasn't huge but I went for the vegetarian soho burger which I have to say was the most amazing vegetarian burger I've eaten, the flavours were amazing. My partner had the New York burger which he also thoroughly enjoyed. We stayed in the bar area till closing and the whole atmosphere and ambience was brilliant. The rooms were very spacious and the whole experience was just different. We will definitely be visiting again it was an amazing little find and Vadim and the rest of the staff made us feel very welcome. Kelly & Tom",5,2016,08,01
119,in a tinny with my twinny,"again another place i have wanted to stay for quite a while. unfortunately  disappointed. i stayed here for one night with a girlfriend so we could do the tourist stuff around and about. the sunborn it self i found lovely, beautiful stair case and chandelier in reception, quick lifts, really large room, and bathroom. all clean. i thought the customer service was very poor. all quite miserable. drinks took a while to be served and the food was more than slow. this alone has marked it down big style for me. we did however have a fantastic tourist day around london and this was a good location. the staff need to smile and remember worse things happen at sea.",3,2016,08,01
119,Not what we expected ,"We arrived to a friendly receptionist who was very helpful. Although was asked for confirmation on what time our table was booked for dinner but had to chase for an answer. 
The room was nice - paid extra for a room with a river view. Good wifi and TV. Very clean room but couple stains on the carpet (room 3040) 
Paid for meal upfront with groupon - was ok but not great - fast service though. 
Costs a lot to have extra on top of main meal. 
Went to bar cocktails are very good.
Now on to the noise....... I would recommend asking for a top floor room - was like the people above were going to come through the ceiling..... Worst ever experienced. Complained in the morning and we were greeted with a frosty response ""did you tell us last night? There's nothing we can do unless you tell us"" nothing was offered as a good will gesture and felt like the blame was on us. 

Good breakfast selection

Nothing to do in the ship other than a small bar and the restaurant. Would of thought may of been a singer or club. Very far away from central London. 

Wouldn't stay again and would not recommend. I also requested something for my partners birthday was told there may be something in the room or at the meal - I didn't take a cake cause thought this would've been done so really disappointed. ",3,2016,07,31
119,stress free  holiday  best  ever  staff  in  history  of  holidays,probably  the  most  brilliant  place  in  London  I  was  speechless  all  the  staff  were   best  people  in  the  world  definitely  the  best  holiday  me  and  my  wife  have  ever  had  only  because  of  how  brilliant  the  staff  were   thank  you  very  much  everyone  at  sunborn,5,2016,07,31
119,Way beyond a travel Inn!,"Wonderful first impression on approach, and not disappointed on arrival. Beautiful 'hotel' next to 2 chain lodges make you wonder why people would book there!... Because Sunborn appears so decadently expensive - but isn't! Beautiful comfy room. Perfect. Our first check for availability will be here next time.

",5,2016,07,31
119,Something Different ,"We visited the the Sunborn for our 6th wedding anniversary this weekend. We parked at the 02 and took the cable cars over the river to the hotel which was nice. I told my wife where we was staying while on the cable car and the hotel was in view. We arrived early (around 1pm) and had a drink on the deck, then to a nearby pub as we was told our room is not available until 3pm. We returned just after 3, however our room was still not ready.  We was giving 2 complimentary drinks vouchers which we was more than happy with! All the staff was very friendly and helpful.  The yacht is good to look at on the outside and the lobby is well presented. I was slightly disapointed with the room as it was not much better to look at than a normal 3* hotel plus there was a lot of stains on the carpet.  It is worth upgrading to the river view room. We never ate at the restaurant so can not comment on that. Drinks are normal London prices. We went up to the sky lounge when we got back to the hotel after dinner to find it is was closed. For the price (£325) I would say it was a good experience but we would not return as we have done it.",3,2016,07,31
119,Excellent stay again at the Sunborn,"Second time we've stayed here, and booked our next stay whilst checking out!! Love the friendly staff, we stayed in an exec river view room and it was excellent. The bed is sumptuous and the linen fresh. 5 star all round. Great location for the O2 and restaurants there, although we went to Cafe Spice Namaste for the evening and had lunch at the O2 travelling over on the Emirates Airline.",5,2016,07,31
119,2nd time around excellent,"Hi first time we stayed was not good but clearly they have redeemed themselves it was so good and could not fault it in anyway ,well worth staying there and had one of the best nights sleep I've had in a hotel we got up late but o well we're on a break,thank you for a good time.",5,2016,07,31
119,London stay with a difference,"We booked as two couple for the Romantic Package to celebrate our birthdays, we wanted something a little bit different. On arrival to check in the service was excellent, really lovely helpful receptionist, we were early so left our bags at reception whilst we wandered off to have a look around and enjoy a trip on the cable car which I can thoroughly recommend great views.  We arrived back on board at 3pm and our rooms were ready.  The rooms were lovely, immaculately clean and much bigger than we had anticipated.  We were greeted with a lovely display on our bed of rose petals and swans!! We all then ventured to the deck to enjoy a G&T in the sunshine, drinks are not cheap but this is London so it's what you expect, we were very impressed though with the choice and quality of the drinks, can very much recommend the various G&T cocktails!! We opted to eat on board as this was part of the package, very impressed with the menu choice and the quality of the food was excellent, I ordered the beef and it was cooked to perfection and there was certainly plenty of it.  We each had a glass of champagne a part of the package but also ordered 2 different glasses of red wine and 2 glasses of Prosecco, when we left and wanted to sign we had actually been charged for 2 bottles by mistake, the member of staff was very apologetic and hoped it hadn't ruined our evening however upon check out the next day when we received our bill, these two bottles of wine were still there and this in my opinion is why I haven't scored it a 5 out of 5 as we then had to spend time explaining to the receptionist that we had in fact only had 2 glasses and not 2 bottles and there was no apology for this.  This left us feeling rather disappointed after what was supposed to be a lovely special occasion.  Breakfast was good, however they do need to ensure they keep on top of replacing items and we did have to ask on several occasions for our tea/coffee but in fairness they were busy.  Overall I would most definitely stay here again, there are excellent transport links into the city and the yacht is very luxurious. ",4,2016,07,29
119,A perfect short break,"Well located and easily accessible. Check in was very efficient, staff pleasant and professional. Had ordered the Romantic package with champagne and swans etc., etc. Absolutely stunning display, nice champagne awaited on ice and was well received. Large cabin had everything we could need, beautifully comfortable bed and a waterside balcony was nice. Upon walking to our restaurant reservation, 3 or 4 members of staff greeted us with good evening...a nice gesture. Restaurant service was very good and the food quite excellent, more than impressed. After dinner sat outside on deck for a few cocktails and watch the dusk descend on Canary Wharf and the City..lovely. Awesome location if involved in something at Excel...not badly priced for London. Very romantic....for us young lovers. (I wish)",5,2016,07,28
119,Groupon offer,"My daughter got this and we had a great stay , reception was very friendly when we arrived we paid extra to be on the river side , our room was lovely . Read review before saying ' treated different as Groupon ' we didn't find this at all ! Our meal and wine was lovely and we paid extra for a lovely pudding . Had a lovely walk along the river after dinner then sat having drinks outside in the bar which was really nice . Breakfast was good although a little on the cool side plenty of choice full English continental fruits and cereals . I would recommend this and I would definitely go back .",4,2016,07,28
119,Luxury stay!,"We recently visited London and stayed for 1 night at the Sunborn Yacht hotel which was an Anniversary treat. We had stayed the night previous in a Travelodge just to make the trip a little longer and more affordable, so was able to leave our car and travel on the Docklands Light Railway to Custom House stop, and a very short walk to the Yacht, which looked impressive on our approach. We were not disappointed, on viewing inside, the beautiful entrance with shiny brass staircase and crystal chandelier the luxury scene was set! We were treated with a friendly smile by a young lady who checked us in to room 5032. An executive cabin with balcony and with a Thames view. The corridors to the cabins seemed very wide, which gave an air of luxury, and  the decor complemented the theme. Once inside our cabin, we were surprised on the size which again was lovely and spacious. A very comfortable bed, with information accessed via computer tablet, kept the upmarket feel. Tea and coffee making facilities, iron and ironing board in one of wardrobes if required. Large TV and fridge with complementary bottled water was also available. The bathroom was small, but perfectly adequate, with miniature Molton Brown products to use. The view from the Balcony, was good as we could see the Emirates cable car and the 02 Arena. We enjoyed a relaxing drink on board before our evening meal, which we had booked well in advance and would recommend to do before you travel. Our meal was delicious, and we celebrated with wine and dessert. A thoroughly lovely time, just so sorry it wasn't longer, but hope to go back again soon.",5,2016,07,28
119,Great venue for a concert at the O2,"Myself and my husband stayed here for 1 night. Beautiful hotel, spacious room with small balcony with view of O2 arena. Short walk to the cable car which takes you to the arena but it closes at 10pm so probably best to get the tube from Excel only 2/3 stops. Close to a few restaurants. Would stay here again ",4,2016,07,28
119,Fabulous stay,"This was my second stay on the Sunborn sadly only for one night. Again everything was perfect with just one little blip, at breakfast despite the attempts of a friendly efficient and very polite member of the dining room staff no marmalade could be found for my toast. Even so a fabulous stay.",5,2016,07,28
119,A birthday treat,Had a brilliant stay with Lunch and breakfast and afternoon tea. Staff were brilliant very helpful and accommodating.  Food was fantastic. Chose this location for easy access to lots of London sights. Room was beautiful and very comfortable.,5,2016,07,28
119,A birthday treat,"This was a real treat and something that was 'different' from a usual hotel experience. Our sons arranged a 'romantic break' as a surprise for my husband and I on my birthday and there were many ways in which I was made to feel special - towels arranged as swans and a heart shape in pink rose petals on the bed, chocolates in the room and at the end of the meal, too. We felt that check in at 3pm was rather late and would have thought that check out at 11am and check in at 2pm was more reasonable.",4,2016,07,28
119,Enjoyable and would go for a one off,"We stayed here for a girl's night out and very much enjoyed it.  The room was good , very clean and big. Not much of a balcony or view but ok.  The 3 course meal we had in the evening was fantastic. Make sure you have the 3 course meal at  £22.50 ( have to eat before 7pm but very lovely and excellent value ) . The only thing we found is that you have to wait ages for drinks to the point that you are starting to think have they  forgotten you !  Enjoyed sitting out having a drink over looking the cable car etc. Overall a good experience and would recommend.",4,2016,07,27
119,Well worth a stay for something different,"Had agreat time 'On Board ' haveing got a good deal with Secret Escapes.
The cabin we had -an executive dock view was fantastic and very large .The Dinner was great but choice slightly limited and £32
Only down side we had poos table service in the bar before dinner resulting in no drink",4,2016,07,27
119,Fab fab fab,Spent the night for our anniversary. Check in smooth. Got a free upgrade to suite with balcony. Slippers and gowns.  Left sweets in the room for our anniversary. 3 course Dinner to die for in their lands end restaurant. At the end brought out a tray with sweets again but wrote in strawberry sauce 'happy anniversary'. Buffet breakfast was superb Inc black pudding! Right on flight path which can be a bit loud. ,5,2016,07,27
119,excellent Hotel,the rooms are very spacious and well appointed queen size bed with sofa and table safe and fridge food excellent staff very friendly and helpful very secure moored in Victoria dock with a lot of eating places close by,5,2016,07,27
119,Birthday stay ,"I got treated to a night at this stunning hotel, and it was absolutely gorgeous! Everything felt very fancy and luxurious from the moment we stepped inside to check in and onwards. The whole interior of the boat is beautiful, lovely reception with a big chandelier, bar area was nice, the deck you could sit out on for a drink was lovely and the restaurant was fantastic too - as was the food! Our room was brilliant, very large and with a view out onto the Thames. We had rose petals decorated on the bed and chocolates, and two additional things I liked about the room was tthe air conditioning  - like a freezer if you wanted! And nice dark curtains to keep all the light out in the morning.  My only negatives about our stay here would be the bar prices which were crazy, and that the only thing offered in the minibar was sparkling water - which personally I can't stand and would have preferred just still! But that aside it was an unforgettable stay that I thoroughly enjoyed and if the opportunity ever came up I would definitely stay again! ",5,2016,07,27
119,Unique ,"Stayed here for our 2nd wedding anniversary as the closest thing I could get my wife to a ""cruise"" experience! So glad we did. The reception staff were friendly and knowledgeable, in fact all the staff were, the hotel has a fantastic feel about it and met all our needs and requests. If I have one slight niggle, it was that sat on our waterside balcony you are right under the take off path from London City Airport which does stop overnight but is my one and only criticism. ",4,2016,07,27
119,An Absolutely wonderful experience ,"My husband & l have just spent 2 nights on the Sunborn Ship & it has been a really wonderful experience & we would definitely stay here again & we would highly recommend it. The rooms are spacious & classy. The restaurant is very expensive but there is a very highly rated Italian called Pepenero which is walking distance from the Ship, we have eaten there many many times and it is always wonderful. ",5,2016,07,27
119,Terrible experience,"Not a good hotel! After a less than stellar check-in with a trainee, the air-conditioning in our room was broken. Our room temperature was nearly 90 degrees Fahrenheit and the hotel would do nothing... Someone came to look at the air-conditioning and said there was nothing they could do except lend us an small fan. This is not acceptable. I paid very good money for the room and the quality was sub par.  I do NOT recommend this hotel and I will never stay here again!",1,2016,07,26
119,Disappointing,"The Sunborn was a bit of a disappointment, the yacht hotel lacked ambience and atmosphere.  The staff were good and helpful.  The room was large enough and the bed comfortable, bathroom was not big but was okay, but had only a small amount of amenity items. The wooden furniture in the bedroom was a sort of orangy colour, not very bedroomy and more like an Arabian restaurant!!!!!  The exterior drinks etc area was small but very pleasant, the interior bar was very ordinary.  A late night drink in the interior bar  was pretty boring apart from noticing a few women who because of the way they dressed and looked could well have been ""working girls"", probably not the image the Sunborn would be happy with.
Very pricey food, very pricey drinks in fact very pricey everything.  It is a unique place to stay but I won't be rushing back or recommending it.",3,2016,07,26
119,A fantastic unique hotel in an excellent location.,"A fantastic and amazingly comfortable room with lush decor. Ideally located within walking distance from the DLR, shops and Excel Arena. Nice Greenway to relax in just outside the Hotel entrance and breathtaking views of the O2 arena and Emirates cable car. Loads of nice restaurants nearby. Overall one of the nicest hotels I have stayed in within London.",5,2016,07,26
119,Amazing hotel ,"We stayed here using a Groupon voucher and I had previously read that people using this voucher were given inferior rooms with a poor view etc. This wasn't the case for us at all. The room was huge, especially for London standards, and had a balcony overlooking the river. The view was amazing and we could see Canary Wharf and the O2 in the distance. The balcony is lovely to relax on and take in the ambience of being on this yacht hotel. The room was beautiful and complete with robes, toiletries , a fridge to use, complimentary water and a coffee machine. The service from the staff was fantastic and all the staff were friendly and very helpful. We ate in the restaurant for our evening meal and for breakfast and the restaurant is also beautiful. Breakfast was buffet style with plenty of choice-including vegetarian options which is very important to me. Plenty of shops and bars in the surrounding area which is away from the chaos of central London. The hotel is a little out of the way and takes about 40 minutes to get to from central London but the hotel is perfect in every way and is well worth the trip.",5,2016,07,26
119,WOW what a amazing place,"Me and my husband went to the Sunborn last thursday with friends to celebrate his 50 birthday, Marvellous place, hotel staff was really friendly couldnt help us enough, rooms was huge and spacious  and  the views was amazing over Victoria Dock 
Resturant was luxury and food was amazing, i will defo be returning to this ship and would advise everyone to visit its well worth it !!!!!!!!!",5,2016,07,26
119,Romantic Getaway,"We booked the Romantic getaway package at the Sunborn London we had an amazing time.. The rooms were lovely and spacious and the we had a room and balcony overlooking the Thames which was also lovely.. The towel swans and petals Were a lovely touch. We ate the restaurant as this was included and again can not fault, the food was amazing..

Only downside is they the dirty people
Above us kept throwing their unwanted drinks off the balcony above which sadly meant it kept landing on ours, and the people Next door done nothing but argue and fight but neither of the above deterred from the lovely night away we had.

Would 100% recommend X",5,2016,07,26
119,An experience to remember,"This was an surprise birthday treat for my husband? An absolutely amazing experience. We can not wait to visit again. We both loved everything about the stay. Location was nice. The fine dining was first class. The staff were second to none. Everything you'd expect from a 5star establishment. Can not fault this experience at all, it was a truly magical experience that I've thought about ever since.",5,2016,07,25
119,Absolutely spot on,Beautiful 'cabin' - massive with top notch fixtures and fittings. Amazing value to be so central - perfect for a London getaway from City airport. Sense of style and grandeur. Really nice bar area.  We had a dock view but fun didn't feel short changed as trees and Excel was a cool view. We will return!! ,5,2016,07,25
119,Visiting Olympic park,"Very quaint place to stay. Friendly staff. Waiters and waitresses fantastic at their jobs. Management should put more waiters on late in the evening. Arrived back late due to the athletics at the Olympic park, very trying visitors who were less than polite to the waiters. Staff were efficient kind a courteous at all times. 

Travelled on the Emirates skyline over to the O2, 2 stops over to Stratford, great. 

Would certainly visit again. 
View from Emirates cable car to the sunburn ",5,2016,07,25
119,Awful Service ,"We thought we would try this place for a cocktail as it looks impressive and it is, after all, a boat. 
We thought it would be quite nice to sit on a balmy summers evening, cocktail in hand, watching the sun go down over London. 

Getting into/onto the boat was the first challenge. You get in an elevator (isn't that how you board ALL boats?) and press the button for level 5. This is the level for the ""Sky Lounge"" which we presumed would be where the cocktail bar was. 

However the lift didn't move. We were in the elevator with a couple of people who were staying on the boat and they didn't know how to get it going either, so it's good to know these things are explained to you if you stay! I suppose everyone should know how to use a lift on a permanently moored pseudo cruise ship. 
They tried their key card but to no avail. 

So we pressed the button for level three and, hey pesto, to level three we went. 
Climbed the stairs to the Sky Lounge only to find it closed for a private function. 

Presumably this is why the lift wouldn't take us there (our names not being on the list) but even if you stay here overnight it appears you are not told about such things either. 

Anyhoo, we ordered our £12 cocktails and were brought a small bowl of nuts. 
We chatted whilst we waited for our drinks, mainly about the pretentiousness of the place, and enjoyed the ambience. 

We chatted some more whilst we waited for our cocktails and then, after 40 minutes, ran out of small talk. 

So we left, just as four drinks headed to the general vicinity of where we were previously sitting. 

Were they ours? We'll never know.......

119,A fabulous stay,Was lucky enough to have been gifted this for a special birthday and the gifters got a great deal on Groupon... Our stay included an evening meal and breakfast.. Both were absolutely delicious.. So much choice for breakfast we were absolutely stuffed.. A nice change staying on a yacht and pretending we owned it.. Slightly disappointing view of scum and rubbish ( Inc shoes) in the water dock side which is where our balcony overlooked... I'm sure could be scooped up or something for a better view.. But that was the only complaint! Beds were super comfy ... Loved it and hope to return sometime ( when Groupon have  another deal!),4,2016,07,25
119,Cancelled our reservation but still charged our card,Feel very disappointed with our booking service. I had booked a room for 22nd July as a birthday treat but due to unforeseen circumstances I had to cancel the booking which I did a week before. The original booking was through Booking.com which stated free cancellation if done by the 20th. On checking my bank account today the Sunborn had decided to charge my card 100.00 for no reason. It took a telephone call to my bank to get the 100.00 re-credited! Not a happy customer and would definitely think twice about booking again!,1,2016,07,25
119,A London Stay - With A Difference,"Stayed at Sunborn as I fancied a bit of a change from the regular London Hotels I stay in. Firstly - it is what is says - it's a boat, and the beauty is it still feels like a boat. Maybe gone a bit OTT with the maritime feel, bit the standards are excellent, the accommodation is exceptionally spacious, as good as any hotel - better than most. 
CLEAN - Spotlessly clean.You could eat from the floors, if for any reason you felt the need to ever eat from a floor!  ACCOMODATION Furnished to a very decent standard, spacious, all the home comforts you would need. NOISE  I was a little concerned about the noise due to the location, but in truth it was not noisy at all - much less than most central London hotels. The wooden floors though do mean that if you have an insensitive lady (or man perhaps?) walking around in high heeled shoes in the room / cabin above - it can be a little irritating.  FOOD   Very impressed by food.   SERVICE  Superb. Staff friendly, helpful, not pushy.  LOCATION:  I wanted to be in docklands so perfect, but really close to DLR so you could get around very very easily.    Would most certainly stay here again - tried it for something different, and glad I did.",4,2016,07,25
119,Fabulous night spent onboard,"I must admit I was a bit reluctant when my husband told me he'd booked this hotel, mainly because of its location - I had wanted to stay somewhere more central. I am so glad we stuck to our booking as we had a wonderful nights stay onboard this yacht. The room was charming and the lovely weather meant we spent a very happy couple of hours on the deck bar watching the cable car go across to the O2 with a back drop of Canary Wharf. Our boys loved staying on the boat and we all slept really well and had a great breakfast. If you are going to book make sure you request a room that overlooks the water rather than the pedestrian side as there is a noisy generator outside the boat. It didn't reduce our happiness with our stay as we kept out balcony door closed and used the aircon. The location turned out to be brilliant. In the evening we walked to the local waterfront bars and restaurants and in the morning we took the cable car and then the city clipper boat to the centre of London which took the same time as the underground but was much nicer. The hotel staff were excellent and we couldn't fault the hotel! I would definitely stay here again as a couple or with my family.",5,2016,07,25
119,Very grand 😊,"Had been waiting since Valentine's Day for this stay.. Yes it was worth the wait! In a nice quite area of London sat on the Thames it was a delight. The reception staff were very polite, Vadim especially, lots of smiles and very chatty. The reception was grand, the staircase is well worth a few pictures. The rooms were very old fashion styled. Very ship like :) we were offered a river view for an extra £20 which of course we took. A balcony looking out on to the old docks and watching the cable cars over to the o2 :) a great idea of having a bath robe and slippers each in the room not only made a great photo but was nice to lounge around in. The bar looking out on the water was great, as night time came it just got more and more romantic. We didn't eat in the hotel but would have if we didn't have a meal booked. Would I come back to this hotel? Yes definitely in a heartbeat.. Overall a great hotel. Great location, room, staff and views. Thankyou sunborn :) ",5,2016,07,24
119,Yacht hotel near Excel Centre.,"We choose Sunborn as it's within walking distance to the Excel Centre, extremely convenient. Also because it's a Yacht hotel on the Thymes river which made it interesting. We had a room not on the river side therefore not a very good view. The rooms are huge and bathroom with shower were ok. Wi-Fi was not good at all. Some front desk staff were not very friendly, others were. Restaurant and room service staff were very nice. Breakfast buffet was very good and if you have it included in the room rate. Nice view from the dinning room with river and Dockland views with the cable cars. There are a few resturants and 2 small grocery stores near by, we did not eat dinner in hotel restaurant so can not comment. Restaurants around Excel Centre were not good in food quality or service. Unque experience on a Yacht hotel. Thank you.",4,2016,07,24
119,Not worth it! don't waste your money ,"Visited this weekend and must say we were deeply disappointed with a few things. 

I always give honest assessments and this was obviously only in my experience. 

We paid £150 through a groupon deal and stayed in a dock view room (please note, we thought this was a view of the river) its not, please ensure you call and make sure you have a river view. 

If you are unfortunate enough to get the dock side, you can enjoy the constant drones of the generator that powers the boat 24 hours a day. You will also get a lovely view of the Very dull concrete area in front of the excel arena. 

We also had a room on the 5th floor right next to the hallway entrance door which everyone makes sure they slam open and closed throughout the night! 

Having looked at the possibility of upgrading the room for the evening, we were bot there was nothing available - this obviously couldn't be helped

cannot comment on dinner as we didnt eat.

we did however go down for drinks, where we were seated outside with a great view, the waiter said he would be with us in a minute to take our order. 10 minutes passed so we decided to head out and leave it! the waiter wasn't aware we were sat there waiting for so long.

The rooms are nice, but no different to a premier inn at half the price. 

Breakfast was very nice. 

Wouldn't recommend, and wont be returning ",2,2016,07,24
119,Not Great,"Usually agree with trip advisor reviews on the whole, and Sunborn receives some pretty good ones.
Staff were lovely really helpful, hotel very clean, rooms large not exactly scruffy but very 70's/80's in style and fairly poorly equipped, silly things, complimentary water but no glasses to drink it from (and we had 2 rooms neither with glasses). Air conditioning cannot be turned off, so always fans running.
Breakfast was fine, not top quality but no real complaints, service in late night bar was non-existent, but due to lack of staff who were trying. We cancelled our restaurant reservation because we weren't that impressed with the rest of the hotel so cant comment.
Location is ok if you need to  be that side of town, but the prices are pretty high, have stayed in much nicer, more central hotels for that money.
Also have noticed that Groupon are now doing offers, great if you want a cheap break, but not a sign of a luxury hotel. It was fine but the good reviews surprise me.",3,2016,07,24
119,40th Birthday Celebration ,"What an amazing experience for my partners 40th birthday!!!
From the moment we arrived until the last moment of our departure everything was perfect! 
The staff is amazing! Room was perfect! Food was amazing! Spa was amazing! 
It is an experience everyone should live it at least one in their lifetime!!! 
",5,2016,07,24
119,Luxury Yacht with a personal feel,"There are luxury yachts and luxury yachts;  Having no idea what to expect from this incredibly great Groupon deal, which was quite a surprise and scheduled to take place at the same time as the Chelsea Flower Show, I must say that I hadn`t really looked too much at this accommodation booking (it was one of those spontaneous things that my guy does) as I was more interested in the flower show. However, as always great plans go wrong, and, although it was supposed to be a non changeable, non refundable booking, the ladies on the yacht booking team, were absolutely SO accommodating and personally steered me (scuse the pun) the way to get a better room with only a small additional cost, and for me to ring her on her evening shift to ensure there WAS room on the re-arranged date to visit.
I THEN looked at the boat/ship/yacht and was STUNNED, at what a beautiful yacht it is. Bedrooms on cruise ships are just boxes, the ensuites you cannot turn a cat round in, but THIS one was absolutely wonderful (ME ? saying that ?) Mirror mirror everywhere, and the most ingenious gadget in the en=suite doubled as a hair washer and bidet. Must have one in my next house build. Anyway; About the ship/service/meals.  The whole trip was SO gorgeous. People swimming along the Thames on a lovely (ONE lovely summer night) in England, and dinner in a beautiful restaurant, floating -admittedly not going anywhere - but the wonderful  view of the fantastic London skyline - there are not that many better in the world, and then breakfast with an even better, closer to the window.  It was really an experience not to be missed and I cannot say more than that. Only one thing, do not wait until you get there to book your dinner table (like wot we did). You will have to wait awhile maybe. DO take the monorail (1/4mile walk up the dock side to the monorail station) and hop over to the Thames Clipper (for the uninitiatted, towards the water), down the ramp and get the Thames Clipper (every 30 minutes £6.40) to every dock and stop on the Thames. Absolutely great trip, great value but give yourself an hour at least.  We alighted at Embankment to go to the theatre (Beautiful - fabulous show) 
Altogether, the first date that had gone slightly wrong, was replaced by an absolutely sensation mid week trip, running to catch the last train home to the North. My feet were KILLING me.",5,2016,07,24
119,You want to stay in a ship...take a cruise!,Would not call this place luxury at all--its ok- a small boat docked on water-tacky gold stairs from the 80s. restaurant food is horrendous--seriously bad. Luckily they have a few good restaurants near by. Only stayed there due to a congress at the centre which is right next door. to go into central London you take the DLR and then the underground. There are 2 normal hotels next door--Novotel and Ibis--stay there so you dont have to battle one working elevator which is the ONLY way out. You cant just walk on and off--too annoying especially when you take a one sec quater floor lift to floor one---you can see the outside but cant get off without the slow elevator.,3,2016,07,23
119,surprisw weekend,"excellent hotel service really good and great location, the only disappointment was that the restaurant was fully booked however staff suggested a local place which was also very good
amazing views on the Emirates sky shuttle",5,2016,07,23
119,Nice enough,"We were in the basic room.  Nice size, nice wooden floor, good condition, lots of storage, bed was quite comfortable the the aircon not too loud.  Bathroom needs an update on the grouting and maybe the shower door needs replacing. The coffee is Lavazza - plenty of supplies.

The bathroom amenities are lacking.  No flannels and only shampoo, conditioner and body wash.

It's nice to sit on the deck just outside the bar, especially while the sun is setting.",3,2016,07,23
119,3 Nights Groupon break,"We stayed in room 2008 18/7/2016, Balcony with a river view.
Room was not quite ready for us when we arrived . Staff were most apologetic and offered us complimentary drinks in the Bar. Very impressed with the professionalism and friendliness of all of the staff.
Breakfast choice was excellent,as was the evening meal that we had. Thoroughly enjoyed our 3 night break and would most definitely return again.",5,2016,07,23
119,Wonderful luxurious break,"This hotel provides excellent service, amazing food and wonderful rooms. We had an executive suite with balcony and loved the experience. It is easily accessed by th DLR and there is the cable car nearby which you can walk to along the Thames that takes you to th O2 arena.",5,2016,07,23
119,A very different place,"A well set out room in a yacht moored on the Thames very near the Excel Conference centre. Stayed here for three nights while attending a conference at the Excel centre.  Room was spacious, beds comfortable and hotel service exemplary. The bar and restaurant was very good too. Breakfast, lingering over a cup of tea, looking over the Thames was very relaxing indeed. Will certainly visit again.",5,2016,07,22
119,Luxury & style,"Booked three rooms for a family celebration.  Can not praise this hotel enough.  Staff were extremely professional and helpful and made you feel special and welcome.  The rooms were immaculate, large kingsize beds, spotless and elegant.  Worth upgrading your room to a balcony and dockview if you can.  the location perfect.  If you are looking for a luxurious stay somewhere completely different look no further.  Ideal for the 02, cable car and thames clipper  thankyou to everyone for making our stay so fabulous particularly Vadim who went that extra mile .  We will be returning - why wouldn't we!",5,2016,07,22
119,Golden Evening,"We took friends here as part of their Golden Wedding celebrations - They Loved It!
Booked two river view rooms, which were very clean, large and comfortable with all you could desire.   Lunch was ok with shared platters of meat, cheese etc.  Meat fine but cheese was very disappointing  - nearly empty platter for price and four very small glasses of wine cost £38.
We took advantage of a Groupon Offer D,B&B but was surprised to be informed at dinner that the deal only included the 'main' course - no veg, starter or dessert.
BUT it was fantastic food!   Beds were very comfortable and the breakfast buffet contained everything you could imagine and was fabulous.  Excellent staff who were friendly, helpful and professional.  Do Go - you won't be disappointed.....",5,2016,07,22
119,Very different but very good,"We stayed for only one night, but access is pretty good being next to ExCel centre, easy to check in and being on a motorbike meant free parking in the excel centre... Might be different if the was an exhibition or event on though!
Glad it wasn't raining or you would want an umbrella for the walk to the entrance!!
Room was reasonable size and clean with good soapy bits in the ship style bathroom, great view over Royal Victoria Dock (with open swimmers in the morning brrrr)
The windows are so good you only notice city airport when you open the doors!!
Didn't eat or drink here but looked to be good services with a sundown deck overlooking the water.",4,2016,07,22
119,A great deal on a 4-star hotel accommodation in London,"This is s great deal on a 4-star hotel property in London. If flying into London City Airport- all the better - the hotel is a 5-minute cab drive from the airport. All the staff were very welcoming, attentive and helpful. We had a room and breakfast deal - breakfast was plentiful and well-prepared. I would suggest upgrading to an executive room/suite with a balcony - but that is a personal preference - the night Canary Wharf high-rise skyline is well-worth it. We used the Emirates Air Line and the MBNA Clipper river boats to get around - very convenient.",5,2016,07,21
119,Beautiful Yacht but staff need a little bit more training!,"Stayed for one night on this lovely yacht.  Had a standard room but it was huge!  The bed was really comfy too.  The breakfast next morning was great with continental and hot breakfast, toast, juice, tea, coffee etc.  I did however have a problem with getting tea.  They first brought a pot of Earl Grey, and whilst I like Earl Grey I didn't want it with my breakfast, so I asked them for Breakfast Tea and guess what.....................I got Earl Grey again.  I gave up and just had juice. The other problem I had was with the bar staff.  I went out for my dinner and when I came back I thought I would go up to the bar for a cocktail (expensive thought they were!).  I sat on a high stool outside studying the cocktail menu and was out here for aroung 15 minutes.  In that time NOT ONE of the bar staff came up to me to see if I was OK and wanted anything.  Anyway the stook was not comfortable and there were no other tables available so I went inside and sat by the door.  Again after 30 minutes NOT ONE of the staff approached me to see if I wanted anything.  So, I went to my room and had some wine there (which I brought with me!!)  So although the boat is lovely and comfy, the staff need more customer relation training.  Was it because I wsa a female on my own??  I don't know but I don't bite and I am not invisible, I also think a female on her own should be looked after a bit more........................... what say you??",4,2016,07,21
119,A lovely oasis away from the hustle of touristy areas.,"Our two-night stay was a birthday present to my husband from our family.  From the moment we stepped ‘onboard’ all the staff were very friendly and welcoming.  Our large Executive room, which had a balcony over-looking the Excel Centre, was well furnished with excellent TV, coffee making machine, fridge and the ensuite shower room had Molton Brown  toiletries.  The free internet was far better than we expected. We enjoyed a drink outside with views to the O2 and Canary wharf in the distance.  There were restaurants in the area but we were booked for dinner in the restaurant.  Dinner was fantastic – full of flavour and we found the portions just the right size for us to be able to enjoy three courses.  
Having booked for one of the hottest days in London this summer we were pleased to discover the air conditioning in our room was very quiet but very effective.  The room were also quiet and we heard no noise from either outside or in the corridor. With the most comfortable bed we had the best night’s sleep.  The buffet breakfast was very good with plenty of choice and even the hot food tasting freshly cooked.
We were also booked for lunch and the view at The Shard.  It was only  5 minutes walk  to the Emirates Cable car to the North Greenwich peninsular then 30 minutes on a Thames Clipper boat to London Bridge.
Having had a late lunch when we returned  to the Sunborn we enjoyed a bar snack of a shared cheese platter while we sat on deck watching the sun go down.  There was a private function going on in the main restaurant but we never heard them leave even though we were on the same side as the exit.
We would definitely recommend to anybody wanting something different for a special celebration and plan to return again ourselves.",5,2016,07,21
119,Birthday treat ,"Decided to treat my other half for his birthday. What an amazing hotel, beautiful  decor, lovely spacious room. Molten Brown bathroom essentials. Robes & slippers. Everything you could wish for. Food was superb & staff where all very kind & helpful. It really was a special treat.  Cable car & O2 only 2minute walk away. ",5,2016,07,21
119,Unusual hotel - especially while working at a conference at ExCeL,"As we made may bookings, we received an excellent room rate so stayed at the Sunborn for 4 nights. The rooms- or should I say cabins - are spacious and very well laid up - it felt exactly like being on a cruise.  The entrance lobby was also excellent with really friendly, knowledgeable reception staf.  Only the service during breakfast let the hotel down.",4,2016,07,21
119,Quiet luxury stay,Booked to stay for two nights on this super yacht.  Git a special offer with evening meal included.  Position is great away from hustle and bustle.  Nice bars cafes and places on dockside to visit.  Rooms where fabulous and even had your own coffee machine.  Lovely views over docks.  Dinner and breakfast was fantastic .  Lovely bar sitting outside on docks.  Dlr great links to Greenwich and London centre.   ,4,2016,07,20
119,Date night,"My boyfriend took me to the Sunborn for drinks.We were able to get a table on the deck which was nice as it was hot and sunny.
The staff were very friendly and welcoming. As well as drinks we ordered food from the bar menu which was very tasty.

Next visit will be to try the restaurant and stay on board for the night.",5,2016,07,20
119,Brilliant yet again,"Stayed on board the Sumborn in April as I was going to a concert at the o2. Fabulous location for this venue, took the Emirates airline across to North Greenwich which makes for great fun, 

Advised the hotel in advance that I was a repeat visitor and was given a room upgrade on arrival which was nice.

Breakfast was lovely, all u can eat buffet with plenty of choice.

The staff were helpful, friendly folk who would happily help with anything.

Will definitely return when attending anything at the o2. If I was just having a weekend in central London I would choose somewhere slightly more central but for the o2 u cannot fault it.

Any questions please ask

119,First class service and attention to detail,"We Booked the Family Room as we were visiting the Star Wars celebration at the excel centre next door. We arrived early and our room had not yet been vacated so the staff booked our luggage in so we could go on to the excel centre without delay or having to lug our cases around with us. When we returned our cases were already in our room.
We were offered a river view upgrade on our room on our arrival too and I am so glad we took up the offer not only because we received a 20% discount on the fantastic breakfast but watching the sun go down over the dock was wonderful.
The room was very clean and well laid out and the soft carpet felt wonderful under very tired feet. The bed was huge and perfect to starfish on so I had a very comfortable night.
The staff I found to be very friendly and helpful and when asked to setup the extra bed in our room the night receptionist said ""He would see to it personally"" and when we returned later that evening it was done and extra bottles of shampoo and shower gel etc. had been left out for us too.
On checkout we mentioned that we were thinking of getting the cable car and river clipper to take us into the centre of London where we would get the tube home and we were told that tickets for these could be purchased through the hotel and that the tickets would be cheaper.
So to sum it up this hotel is first class luxury accommodation at very competitive prices and if visiting the O2 or Excel it is a must.",5,2016,07,20
119,"Amazing hotel, location and price ","I stayed here for business but added a bit of couples time! This hotel is as nice as it looks. It is surprisingly spacious inside yet luxurious. My room was very nice and spacious and had a balcony overlooking the dock. The room could do with a bit of tlc. The breakfast was very nice and very reasonable. Dinner was also nice but a little overpriced. Sitting out the back of the boat at the bar was amazing in the sun.
Highly highly recommended hotel and can't wait to stay there again!!!",5,2016,07,20
119,First class afternoon tea in London,"Just want to thank the staff of the sun born yacht especially Gintare and Lench for looking after us so fantastically and making our afternoon Birthday tea so special for our group of five girls yesterday .The food was great ,severe great ,and the boat is fantastic. This afternoon tea is not to be missed if you are looking for a special treat Anne Smart and the girls",5,2016,07,19
119,Wow oh wow.,"I booked this through Groupon for my husbands birthday.A little way out,beside the O2 and took the Emirates cable car to the destination.A beautiful sunny day,which made it so enjoyable.We arrived earlier than we anticipated but the staff could not of done more.We were offered a £20.00 upgrade to have a River view which we took and so glad we did.The room or I should say suite was stunning.
The evening meal did not disappoint either and the restaurant surroundings were spectacular,and as before the staff are attentive but not overbearing.Breakfast was also included in the deal and it's another wow for that.
I will definitely look out for another deal like the one we got,pure luxury at an affordable price.
Special mention to the wonderful staff,you are all really nice,Thankyou to you all.",5,2016,07,19
119,Would not recommend!,"Groupon do a fantastic sell on this Yacht Hotel, looks can be deceiving and so can being treated as second class citizens.

I'm sure glad we didn't pay full price as £199 is over priced in my opinion. The offer included an overnight stay with breakfast and main meal with wine in the evening. We had chosen to stay here in a group of two couples as a special occasion.  

We arrived prior to the allocated check in time at 2pm , check in was from 3pm. There was no option to gain our rooms early. Bags we could leave at reception and we chose this option on the proviso they would be in our rooms later. 

We visited the bar while we waited for our room. The bar was like a cruise ship, felt very close and I'm not tall perhaps the mirrored ceilings didn't help. Never mind the staff rallied around and did their best offering a good level of service. 

The room itself was spacious and clean but our view was of the Excel Arena and a very dirty watered dockside. See attached images. We, both parties attempted to raise a complaint but no offer of being moved or any upgrade options!! I'm sure the Yacht was not sold out. 

For dining on the evening we were forced into a table booking at 1830 and there was no ability to change this other than till gone 2100 hours. On being seated there was plenty room and availability to have us eat later at a more suitable hour but as other reviewers have indicated, because we are Groupon we don't get a choice. 

The food itself was adequately presented  and tasted alright, l wouldn't have paid over £20 in a restaurant willingly though, fortunately it was thrown in. The only up side was that we were allowed to change the wine option to either beer, water or other soft drink. 

After a very early meal, the options for nightlife were lacking. Whilst it is within a walking distance of the tube l wouldn't quite fancy walking the area by night so we all went back to our room to watch TV! 
 
Breakfast was what you expect. Our friends found it salty. I stuck to the continental option which let's face it you can't get wrong. 

Checking out what a farce, the staff didn't know their right hand from their left. The system was up, the system was down. Our  friends had a balance to pay but had to leave card details, on pushing that we wanted to pay cash we were told oh a receipt can be emailed later!! Forgive me, but is there not a paper invoice book in the management office or am l just cynical and old. 

All in all ..... Hotel manager, please pass on our thanks to your bar staff/ waiting staff/ cleaning staff and front of house manager who were very nice and polite but some of the girls on reception one of your most front facing roles perhaps need to learn a skill or two in customer service.  

Despite what the hotel state is their position on treating everyone as a VIP on my friends review, this is clearly not the case and whether they wish to or not you are discriminated against by booking through Groupon. The reviewers are not wrong. 

Would l recommend here?? Absolutely not and you can do far far better for both the location & the money.

119,"Great Hotel, Great Location, Disappointing Staff","How can you have a hotel so lovely as this, set in a location as great as this and you train your staff to smile but be ineffective? First of all the hotel is super and the rooms are first class but you need a card key to you floor, we were on the 5th floor and the landing door was faulty for 4 out of 5 days of our stay.

It meant no matter what time of the day or night you had to go to reception on the 3rd floor and get someone to come and open it or go to the 4th floor and use another entrance .....provided someone had left the door open. We were working 15 hour days at Excel and to have to keep going down all the time when all they needed to do was wedge it opn and put a sign up till it was fixed. Poor, poor management and attention to detail. Ruined our stay despite the hotel being first class. The staff mostly smile, listen to your complaint and do nothing.",3,2016,07,18
119,Spot On :),"Brought on a Groupon for hubbies birthday.  Great Location for Excel Centre & O2 that we had tickets for and went across to on the £3.50 cable car few minutes away with our travelcard (lovely day and night pictures to be had)  Everything onboard was brilliant, clean and shiny!  Massive room with free bathrobes & iPad use - 20 mins free on all your devices, lavaza coffee machine as well as kettle, a small balcony in the room that we used due to some Thai Chi exercises in the gardens opposite.  Lovely areas onboard to sit, drink and chill.  Even a spa that we could of paid to use but had a full day and night planned.  Excellent food - evening meal with glass of wine and plentiful buffet breakfast was included in the Groupon.  Very efficient, smart staff, nothing was any trouble or bother to any of them and a thank you to Vladim on reception check in for a complimentary glass of Champagne due to a few minutes delay👌🏽 Custom House DLR stop is next door.  Thank you all for a memorable stay  😎",5,2016,07,18
119,Another wonderful stay,"This is my second visit to the sunborn London, and again what a lovely experience, the staff especially Vadim (who went beyond to help) are so friendly and helpful, the room was spotless, I really cannot rate this hotel highly enough. Cannot wait to stay there again :)",5,2016,07,18
119,The perfect ending to a perfect day ,"My partner and I went to the Star Wars celebration and we decided to have a drink at what seemed to be the most interesting place around (after the Death Star of course!), the Sunborn Hotel. 
Honestly,it was a good choice. 
We enjoyed the sunset on the deck and we had few good aperitifs. 
Nicolae was friendly and very welcoming and the bar manager (sorry I didn't ask for your name) was just outstanding. This young guy was informative and very courteous. He spoke to us about the company and he seemed to be genuinely happy and enthusiastic about his work and where he works. After this visit we then decide that we will book a room for our next week end off.
Thank you guys. You ended my day ( which was great) in a perfect manner.  ",5,2016,07,17
119,Somewhat disappointed,"Stayed here last week, the yacht is immaculate, our room was also very clean, all needs facilitated and great views. This was marred by the disappointment of booking for a birthday occasion and not being advised that the restaurant was full, we weren't even told this when we checked in despite being asked about our intention to dine and us confirming our intention to dine! That said, we could have dined in our room but did not wish to, and the bar staff offered to serve our food in the bar but the tables in the bar are very low so inappropriate for dining and it was too windy to dine outside. Anyway all of that is irrelevant as the kitchen disagreed with the bar staff and refused to cook from the main menu leaving us with the option of the bar menu. The bar staff were great, very helpful, very friendly and bubbly, most of the other staff encountered seemed stressed but were probably busy. Finally, the room we stayed in (5020) was noisy, lots of very loud banging at 1.45am and 7.45am, presumably for closing and setting up of something or another. All in all we were left flat.",3,2016,07,17
119,Fabulous in every way.,"For what we paid (£119) this was an excellent choice. The staff,  were lovely, from the reception to the bar staff, and dining room too. It is pricey to drink or eat on board but worth treating yourself to a lovely sundowner on the deck with a great view towards Canary Wharf, the O2 and London. Diner was excellent but pricey and we had to ask for the set menu that we had noticed earlier, as we were initially just given the a la carte menu. There is a wonderful ambience and view from the dining room. Our room was on the lowest level and looked out onto the dockside. There are rooms with much better views but somewhat more expensive. The room itself was beautifully spacious with a seating area, very comfy beds and Molton Brown products in the bathroom. The décor of the boat is lovely too. There are plenty of more reasonably priced eateries, bars and corner shops in the area to try.",5,2016,07,17
119,Excellent stay,"Booked this for anniversary and were impressed from the outset.  Staff extremely friendly and the room was spacious and comfortable.  Wonderful location right next to DLR and cable car ride.  Drinks on the deck in the evening afforded a wonderful view of Canary Wharf and we enjoyed it all, very different from a conventional hotel.",5,2016,07,17
119,Afternoon Tea,I can honestly say this is the worst afternoon tea I have had in London. Firstly the sandwiches and cakes were served or thrown on two dinner plates. The brownies were so dry I couldn't eat them. Barely any cream in the cream horn. Not enough cream for the scones.   No offer of a tea top up.  The cup cakes didn't seem to be the standard of Hummingbird.  When we finally got someone's attention to ask for the bill then they asked did we want anything else after being ignored for an hour. Then had the audacity to add a service charge!!,1,2016,07,16
119,"Nice, but not mind blowing","Having stayed at the Sunborn Gibraltar, I was expecting the same level of luxury and service however Sunborn London wasn't quite up to it. Our dock view room looked at the dock (it was lower ground) and the dirty water going past, however the bed was comfortable, wifi good and room amenities were good quality. The hotel's prices were a little expensive for the average traveller but there is a nisa (selling vegemite - hooray!), Tesco and restaurants nearby.",4,2016,07,16
119,super yacht super stay well done,"we booked into the hotel with the lovely girls everything explained and off we went to our room,everything gr8  staff 1st class,we booked for dinner and glad we did,food excelent and staff gr8 and  we were treated like vips by ladieslav gr8 chap  ",5,2016,07,16
119,A room with a view,"Had a great one night stay here as visiting the area and wanted to stay somewhere different. Definitely lives up to its billing and located next to the Excel Centre is a must if going to an event. Booked a Exec Room Riverside and was amazed at its size considering it's a boat. Bathroom was on the small side but understandable. Views were good, especially if you like plane spotting! Rooms are very well insulated though from overhead noise. 
We booked a reservation in the Lands End Restaurant with the Early Bird offer (5-7pm). We had 2 very tasty courses and a bottle of house Red to savour with it. 
Drinks are quite pricey, but that's London for you!! With did get two 25% vouchers off our first drinks in the bar which was a nice touch. Friendly staff, easy reception, though an extra £40 is secured as deposit for extra's?? Think it's more a decent 4* hotel rather than the 5* as advertised. 
Overall though, a very different hotel against the others located nearby. ",4,2016,07,15
119,Ms Louise Rice,"Had a lovely stay although there was a couple of things that disappointed me. 1. I asked if it was ok to take our drinks out on the deck as it was a lovely day and it seemed to be hassle for them to agree that this was ok which was a shame and the hand rail in the sauna was hanging off the wall which when considering the cost of the room again I found disappointing. Other than that we enjoyed ourselves, thank you",4,2016,07,15
119,Awesome !!!!!,"Stayed here for our 10th wedding anniversary and had the most amazing stay, the staff were incredibly friendly and overall a very relaxed weekend, will definitely be returning in August with our daughter who is very excited.",5,2016,07,15
119,Lovely views and large room.,"Yacht looks lovely from afar, and has a lovely foyer. There was a slight hold up finding our reservation as my phone had died and couldn't remember the email i had booked on - found the staff friendly, but obviously were skeptical of me (not sure what to make of this!) We were told there would no dinner booking available as we arrived around 6pm, reception recommended a restaurant a few minutes walk which was OK. Room was very large, good facilities, including coffee machine (my partner loves coffee!) and a nice shower, shame there wasn't a bath. Interior was quite outdated and carpet, which was a greeny colour was looking old and had marks all over it. Breakfast was lovely, great selection of foods and nice view whilst eating. We had to wait 15 minutes to be seated and after sitting down for 20 minutes were told they were packing away shortly so that was quite disappointing would of liked to of had a longer breakfast. Would say overall unique venue and good price on secret escapes.com at £149 i wouldn't of paid much more.",4,2016,07,14
119,Brought as a gift,"Great staff, lovely but a few things weren't working so we ended up being offered another night there at a discounted rate which was given to my niece and her chap. Food was nice? Breakfast was lovely, overall a nice stay! You can see the 02 arena from the boat. Be lovely in the summer! ",3,2016,07,14
119,A gorgeous one night away from reality,"My partner and I stayed here for one night last weekend and we were not disappointed. Check in was seamless and our room was a dock view room, which I thought would be small (ish). How wrong was I? A great size, plush carpet, even the guest services are on a tablet rather than a book. The shower room was surprisingly spacious And Molton brown products were a nice surprise.
The actual interior throughout is stunning, Windows, mirrors and brass. All clean and In great order.
We had cocktails in the bar before dinner which were lovely and then had a three course meal in the main restaurant. 
I had a feeling the portion sizes would be tiny, but no they were generous and the food was beyond delicious. Luckily the service matched this and we had a very enjoyable meal finished with us sitting out on the deck afterwards to enjoy the view and finish our bottle of red.
A 12pm check out was a lovely treat for our sore heads the following morning. The service we received throughout our stay from every member of staff we encountered was faultless. 
Overall we were actually sad to leave, I wouldn't have changed a thing to the point we have already rebooked to return.

Absolutely recommend to anyone looking for some time out away from real life with a little bit of luxury thrown in for good measure.",5,2016,07,13
119,unusual venue,"We stayed just one night and cannot recommend it highly enough. We were on an organised trip so were not involved in the booking. Check in was quick and efficient. The room was well equipped and delightful, looking out on to the river, beautiful at night. Lovely comfortable bed and very quiet location. Had checked the restaurant online but didn't book as didn't know when we would arrive. Unfortunately,they were fully booked. Very disappointing. Breakfast good apart from hard fried eggs",4,2016,07,13
119,"A very enjoyable visit, sadly spoiled by a poor staff member","I booked a room on the Sunborn for my wife's birthday, I was planning on staying elsewhere in London but then came across the Sunborn and the unique factor got me  and after looking at the reviews and facilities I went ahead and booked it.
Upon arriving we made our way to reception and were greeted by a friendly and efficient member of staff who checked us in and directed us to our room and thankfully made no mention of the romantic package I had added to our room as a surprise (a lovely arrangement of towel sculptures and fresh rose petals in the shape of a heart on the bed and a tray of chocolates) 
We made our way to the room, on the fourth floor which was very nice. We had a great view over the water and the room was clean well maintained and well equipped. There was a fridge with 2 bottles of complimentary water. A good coffee machine and tea making facilities as well as a king sized bed, sofa and table, large shower ironing facilities and bathrobes. All in all very nice and comfortable.

In the evening the bar was very good, very friendly table service and great drinks, my wife who in 3 months pregnant really appreciated the choice of 3 ""mocktails"" which were delicious and a welcome break for her as she has been stuck drinking lemonade or juice every time we have been out recently. The views from the bar terrace were stunning at night the light of Canary Wharf look quite beautiful.

We didn't eat in the restaurant as the time we wanted was fully booked but did have breakfast in the restaurant in the morning. We were seated quickly and asked if we wanted any coffee or tea, coffee for one was ordered and while we were waiting it, helped ourselves to breakfast from the buffet. The quality of the food was very good and was hot and tasty. By the time I was around half way through my breakfast I asked the lady that seated us if she would be able to find out where the coffee was as it had been 10-15 minutes by this point. She told me to wait and that it was being made and would be out soon. We continued to eat and by the time we had finished our breakfast there was still no coffee. We had also noticed by this point that no other tables around us were getting their hot drinks either, lots of people were getting visibly annoyed by this point. I asked another waitress how long the coffee would take and she responded ""you want to order coffee?"" I told her we had already ordered it, spoken to another member of staff about it and since finished our whole breakfast. She responded in a very snappy tone and seemed quite annoyed and asked why we hadn't asked her before if ""we'd been waiting so long"" I repeated that we had ordered and chased and did t feel I should have to order for a 3rd time to get something so simple. She continued being short and rude and said she would get the coffee for us. A few minutes later she came back and banged 2 large jugs of coffee onto our table and walked off. Not sure why we got enough coffee for 3-4 people when only one was ordered, or why she felt the need to be so rude about it but it sadly took the shine off our visit.

Other than this experience everything was great I would definitely recommend the Sunborn to a friend I would just hope they aren't served by the same girl in the restaurant.

I think 3 stars or ""Average"" may be a little bit of a harsh rating, but 4 stars is ""very good"" and due to the rude service I don't feel very good would be accurate either, so 3 stars it is.

It's a shame that 1 member of staff can spoil a visit so much when every other staff member were completely professional and very friendly ",3,2016,07,12
119,Where to start....? ,"We booked this with friends through Groupon for £199 which included over night stay with breakfast and main meal with wine in the evening. 
On arrival we were a little early as we had travelled a long way. Unfortunately our room wasn't ready, but were able to check in and leave our bags at reception. The reception manager was polite and friendly and our bags were taken to our room when it was ready.
We visited the bar while we waited for our room. The bar was lifeless and expensive but the barman was again polite and friendly.
Our room was spacious and clean but our view was of dockside and concrete... 
We were only able to book a table at 1830 and there was no ability to change. The food itself looked nice on the plate but was incredibly salty. 3 out of the 4 of us left at least half on the plate. 
After a very early meal, there was not much else to do. The Sky bar is just an empty room at the top of the yacht but we thought we could get a cocktail to finish the evening. 
There is nothing nearby to see or do. So all of us went back to our room to watch TV! It seems the Love 
island final was our only option. 
Breakfast was a nice selection of cereal/continental and cooked but again very salty. 
Checking out turned out to be a lot of hassle with systems ""going down"" and unable to pay our bill on a card and when I offered cash they were unable to provide a receipt. Needless to say I let them call later for my card details when it was up and running. 
All in all ..... Hotel manager, please pass on our thanks to your bar staff/ waiting staff/ cleaning staff and front of house manager who were very nice and polite but some of the girls on reception were quite rude and unhelpful. 
We felt that being Groupon customers we were treated differently and there was no option to change our table booking to later due to fact we booked via Groupon. 
 Even though the restaurant was half empty at 1930 onwards. 
Would we stay here again?... No!
We left wanting more and felt quite disappointed. ",2,2016,07,12
119,Excellent hotel,"This was a really lovely weekend spent in London. The exterior of the hotel is very pretty and the inside matches to a tee. Location is down by the docks and it easy to get to via the DLR. You can get to the 02 via the Emirates air line cable cars, beautiful view at night. The room is huge and has everything you need.

Just around the corner you will find a few restaurants and a shop if you need it. 

All in all a really nice hotel.",5,2016,07,12
119,AN UNBELIEVABLE EXPERIENCE!,"From the moment we found our way to reception,to the moment we checked out,this whole new experience was outstanding!
Firstly our cabin was overlooking TheThames (its worth that little bit extra just for that!)
it was larger than we anticipated with a sumptuous bed and wonderful pillows(quite rare nowadays!)
The cocktail bar,again has views of The Thames and was very inviting,all the staff were very attentive.We had booked a break that included dinner and a bottle of champagne.
There was a little bit of confusion over this but eventually one of the senior members of
staff soon rectified it.
Dinner was superb!We even felt that we had had private dining,as we were on our own just at the top of the staircase!Can I just mention Ben in the restaurant,what a nice guy!
He had only been working on the liner for a few weeks,but interacted with great confidence with the four of us!Hold on to Ben Sunborn!!
Can't wait to visit Sunborn again,next time we will make the stay longer!",5,2016,07,12
119,Yacht hotel on the river ,This was surprise trip for two nights visiting London for the weekend. The Sunborn is a luxury yacht near the excel with easy access to central London on the DLR but out of the way of the noise of a big city. We had a room overlooking the water which was fantastic. The rooms are very spacious and nicely decorated in keeping with what you would expect on a cruise liner. This is fantastic place to stay and an alternative to a normal hotel. If you want something a little extra special I would recommend this to anyone.  ,5,2016,07,11
119,Booked this trip for my 40th birthday ,"Had the most amazing time staff were very helpful in ever aspect of our stay our room was beautiful with fantastic view , we had booked table for dinner food was outstanding presentation was lovely staff were told it was my birthday so they came out with slate plate with happy birthday wrote on in strawberry sauce and chocolate truffles. We also booked massage in the beauty salon for the next morning they were very professional and very relaxing will definitely be going back again very soon .",5,2016,07,11
119,Out of the ordinary,"Stayed overnight as part of a 'Groupon' gift package. Dinner (or, more precisely, a main course') and a glass of wine were included in our deal.

Location is a comfortable walk from Custom House Station on DLR. Reception was friendly and we were asked if we wanted a non-landside room (at extra cost) which we declined. Our room, or should I say cabin, was on Deck 2 immediately adjacent to the Hotel Entrance. It was an 'Executive' room so quite spacious and also had a small balcony. Curtains were of the 'black out' variety so light ingress at night was not a problem. Similarly, there are no night flights from London City Airport so aircraft noise was not an issue post 9pm but could be if you wanted an extended 'lie in'.

Bed was large and comfortable and the bathroom fine with bathrobes provided. Adequate storage but only five clothes hangers provided - no doubt more would have been provided on request but we felt there should have been more there as a norm Ironing board and iron also in wardrobe. Largish flat screen TV had access to all 'Freeview' channels and there was a tablet bedside for accessing the hotel directory and surfing the web ( free Wi-Fi). There was a mini-bar in the room but, apart from two complimentary bottles of water, it contained nothing else.

A largish bar is located behind reception and this has an open rear deck area for those wishing to sit outside (or smoke). We didn't go outside but, as non-smokers, would not have enjoyed sharing the space with those that do.

The Lands End restaurant was one deck up and reasonably busy during our visit. Food was fine and the service just right, we weren't in a hurry. Three main courses carried a supplement (£5) for those on our package. I opted for braised pig cheeks and they were delicious.

Breakfast was in the same location and was buffet style with, generally, only tea and coffee being brought to your table. The variety of fare on offer was quite extensive but, as with most buffets, the hot offering was often warm rather than piping. The fried eggs looked pretty solid and the bacon quite limp.

Finally, you need your room keycard to move about the hotel/ship including the elevators. Overall, we enjoyed our visit.",4,2016,07,11
119,Gleaming yacht hotel in the heart of Excel,"What a great couple of days was had staying on the Sunborn,  A luxury yacht moored at Excel which literally gleams.  Really comfortable room (we did upgrade to a riverside room though don't expect a stunning view) and very friendly and courteous staff.  The meal included in our package was excellent and particular mention to the bar staff who were attentive at all times.",4,2016,07,10
119,Impressive reception but disappointing overall,"I booked a night away for myself and my husband to celebrate our 21st wedding anniversary. A friend who visited the Sunborn London said she loved it so I thought it would be the perfect place for us to go.

Firstly, its a yacht but it doesn't have the buoyancy of a yacht, it doesn't move at all. I really thought it would! The reception of the yacht hotel is impressive and the room was very comfortable, but those are the only points I liked. Our room faced onto the Excel and had a balcony. When I stood on the balcony and looked down into the water, there was loads of litter floating there - bottles, plastic bags, shoes etc. I thought the hotel would have had a cleaning regime by which they collected the rubbish, it was so unsightly. A large net on a pole that people use to clean swimming pools would do. 

After we checked in, we went to the bar for a cocktail. The bar was pleasant but it didn't have the right 'feel', its hard to put my finger on what was missing about it. The cocktails were lovely but the tables and chairs were dirty - they hadn't been wiped down from previous customers and there were kids running in and out of the heavy door that leads onto the deck at the front of the yacht.

Dinner in the Land's End restaurant was also disappointing. London prices for food that does not equal London quality. No ambience, no atmosphere, no communication between staff with regard to menus, no background music and very brightly lit. 

We paid £428 for one night stay that included 4 cocktails, 2 course dinner and bottle of wine. There was no breakfast included with this price and we didn't have any, we preferred to leave straight away and have breakfast at home. If the atmosphere was better, the bar was cleaner and the food was exceptional, it might be a 5 star review from me. But I'm afraid it wasn't exceptional and sadly, we won't be returning customers.",3,2016,07,10
119,Quirky but ultimately dissapointing,"Although a little off the beaten track the yacht looks great when you arrive and it ticks all the quirky and different boxes.The reception area looks fantastic and our room on the lobby level was very good. We didn't have a river view, which may be a deal breaker for some, but it wasn't a big issue for us.

The room rates are on the high side given the out of town location and it's possibly this that leads to the slight feeling of dissapointment. When you pay top dollar, you expect top dollar goods and services and it doesn't live up to expectations.
The pre-dinner cocktails in the bar were excellent but the bar area itself was not up to standard. Dirty tables not cleared or wiped down and very noisy with the door to the deck area constantly opening and banging shut with kids running around.....not the relaxed, snug, club feel we expected.

The restaurant didn't quite hit the mark either. Starters and main courses were best described as average (again at a top dollar prices) but my main criticism was the lack of atmosphere. Poorly lit (far to bright) with a bad table layout and no background music to make it feel a bit more intimate.

So, quirky and different but without some improvements in key areas not value for money v's a quality Central London hotel.
",3,2016,07,10
119,Lovely but sneaky,"A lovely boat, lovely staff,  lovely rooms! But we paid for meal room and breakfast. When it came to meal staff several times said meal included...we ordered meal (starter really wasn't my cup of tea, still frozen and tasted horrible)  after meal we asked for bill as we had extra drinks & drinks only was on that bill!!!!!!! When checking out next day we then had another bill from restaurant with starters and puddings coming to £90 ish!!!!!!!!! This was not made clear enough and we found how staff went round this was very sneaky!!!! This was the same for others people staying too and felt the same as us!!! We did enjoy our stay but to be honest won't go back.",4,2016,07,10
119,Super experience,"My husband and 10 friends have returned from a two night break from this fantastic hotel. Very difficult to find fault with anything. The room was great.  everywhere was spotless, couldn't find a speck of dust anywhere. We paid for an executive room and it had all the extras including a Tablet to use with free wifi. The beds were super big and super comfortable. The room was very well soundproofed, we heard no outside noises at all.  If any criticism is to be made it would be the drinks were a bit expensive and you paid extra for small bowls of vegetables at dinner.  There again buffet breakfast had lots of choice and plentiful. This was made extra special as we were in a party of 12 and the staff laid breakfast up in a separate room. I wouldn't hesitate to stay here again or recommend other people to.",5,2016,07,10
119,Fabulous,"We stayed for one night in July after seeing Seal at Greenwich. We were met by a lady called Sandra at Reception. She was very helpful and efficient. Cannot rate her highly enough. Thanks Sandra. 
Our room was on the waterside so we had a fab view of the Thames and the room was spotless with a really comfy bed.
All the staff were very accommodating and polite. Would definitely recommend as something a bit different. Bar food was lovely and plenty of it. Breakfast was plentiful and very tasty.",5,2016,07,08
119,Fab anniversary stay,"My husband and I stayed at the Sunborn in London for 1 night back in August last year, for our one year wedding anniversary, and had a fabulous stay.

Check-in: my husband had emailed ahead of our stay to let them know it was our anniversary, and on check-in we were thrilled to be upgraded to a junior suite. The staff were very friendly and helpful, and check-in was quick and smooth.

Room: the room was wonderful. As you entered the bathroom was on the right, and was large and very well-appointed, with high-quality complimentary toiletries. There was then a separate living area complete with dining table and chairs, sofa, coffee table, mini-bar and television, and then a bedroom with king-size bed. Storage space was plentiful, and furnishings were a high standard.

Decor was traditional bordering on slightly dated, so might not able to everyone, but personally I felt it very in-keeping with the fact it was on a boat (lots of wood and brass, for example).

The best feature for me personally though had to be the deck: it ran the length of the room and was huge, with views over the docks and to the Millenium Dome. We were lucky with the weather and spent several hours out there enjoying the sun with a bottle of bubbly.

Bar: we had a couple of cocktails at the bar after dinner, and would recommend it. The cocktails were of a high standard, service was excellent, and the prices were not too bad for central London. They have seating outside which I would recommend if the weather permits.

Location: probably the only real con; it would not be a good base for sightseeing as it isn't very accessible, but for our needs was fine. There are several bars and restaurants in the area; we tried a couple and enjoyed them.

Summary: we would definitely return again for a short trip on a special occasion, and would try to stretch to two nights if we did; one just wasn't enough! Great experience, would recommend.",5,2016,07,07
119,Outstanding,"My friend and I recently had the privilege of staying on this stunning yacht hotel, from the time we set foot into the beautiful reception/check in we were transported in to pure heaven...
The staff were exceptional from the manager to the service ladies and gentleman, we were made to feel very special from check in to departure, our only disappointment was we weren't there long enough, hopefully we will be lucky enough to stay again some day.",5,2016,07,06
119,FABULOUS EXPERIENCE AT THIS BEAUTIFUL PROPERTY,"This venue may not be in the fashionable and popular tourist mecca that is the West End. But if you've done that and seek a point-of-difference that is quiet, palatial, unique and stimulating with beautiful appointments and staterooms supported with a very comfortable lounge area with views and great staff at every turn for every need, then you should seek-out the best package you can find, and afford yourself this very special 'Treat'. Please say Hi to Alessandro and Ben and give my love equally and especially to Timea, Isabel and Ligita; thoroughly recommendable.
Tip: arrange to arrive via the Emirates Air Line Cable Car via Nth Greenwich Tube.",5,2016,07,05
119,Afternoon tea,"Very disappointing , sandwiches tasted like they had just come out if the fridge, all the fish tasted the same, the scones were cold  when asked for them to be warmed, they came back as hard as a rock, brownies were too big, and very dry, miniature cupcakes, were bland....it was awful, I would never go bac k.",2,2016,07,05
119,Wonderful experience ,We booked this hotel for a birthday weekend away. It is a truly wonderful hotel in a fabulous location. Food was lovely and the staff delightful. Perfect location for the O2 where we were attending a concert. The cable car is convenient and a must. Beds were comfy and shower excellent. 5*. ,5,2016,07,05
119,Much more than I had expected,"Bigger than I had expected and even more luxurious than I had expected. The reception staff were very friendly and helpful; the room was large, very comfortable and had all mod cons with an excellent view over the docks. The bar staff were very friendly and provided excellent service. We shall go back for another special occasion.",5,2016,07,05
119,Something different,"I booked a Groupon deal which was a nights stay, massage and dinner and it was a great price so cant complain there!
We got the cable cars over which was a great experience, once on the yacht it is a quirky experience and rooms are nice would of been nice to have been offered an upgrade to river side as it would of been worth the extra cost!
We found the restaurant to lack atmosphere and food choice was limited! There isn't much in the local area as other have said we headed back over to the o2 for the cinema.",3,2016,07,05
119,Anniversay Treat,"We were looking for something different to do for our anniversary and found this on a Google search.

The Receptionist was very helpful and explained all the relevant information. Our cabin was very comfortable with all you need for a nights accommodation. We were lucky to have a view of the quay so suggest you request a quayside cabin as the view is so much better.
We had dinner in the restaurant which had mixed opinions. My girlfriend had sea bass which was served cold and her main was chicken which to be brutally honest was fairly plain. My main was lamb and that was lovely.

The bar lacks a bit of atmosphere but if you are fortunate to have a clear sunny evening the views sat outside would be great.

Certainly worth a visit and would do this again.",4,2016,07,05
119,Beautiful Hotel,"The Sunborn was a stunning hotel, pure luxury, we upgraded to a Thames view room and it was completely worth it - we had a stunning view of millennium point and when the night falls the streets light up and light up the waters it's beautiful. We had dinner and breakfast on board to which both are highly recommended whilst you enjoy your stay. Would def stay again! ",5,2016,07,04
119,Amazing this hotel is a must!,"Booked this hotel for my partners 40th birthday night. We was not disappointed! Beautiful and pure luxury from the start. We booked a suite as it was a special night and a complete surprise for my parter. We arrived at the boat, and was delighted! Even just standing outside the boat waiting for the lift was pure luxury. The suite was amazing ! Clean, bright, offering a balcony. We never ate in the hotel, but we did use the bar. Staff we're fantastic and very polite and the bar offers the most amazing views of London. We did however bring a bottle of champagne and chill it our selfs in the mini fridge in our room. We are very much looking forward to our next stay at this hotel.... In a suite again and I have recommended this beautiful hotel to all of our friends and family.",5,2016,07,04
119,Birthday Celebrations on a Cruise to Nowhere,The best experience in a hotel ever.  We had a great stay at the weekend and staff were excellent.  The ship was clean and very luxurious.   The Afternoon tea was the best ever. Would recommend for anyone to stay especially if you are celebrating something.,5,2016,07,04
119,Lovely visit,"Had a lovely night stay here, just wish it was longer. The whole experience was very enjoyable and very relaxing.  Paid £20 for an up grade to dock lands view from our executive room which was worth it for the stunning views.  Excellent food and very friendly staff. Would definately stay again",5,2016,07,03
119,Cruise to nowhere,The sunborn is a very nice hotel with a difrence rooms are big all you need staff are freindly bar food was nice didnt try restaraunt drinks are quite good.molton brown toiletries kettle coffee machine and complimentry water would stay agsin.,5,2016,07,02
119,"Earth, Wind & Fire @O2","Another great night spent on this wonderful floating hotel 😎 Just perfect, with attentive, friendly staff in the bar and a superb Club Sandwich, great Margarita and Devine champagne..
The book in and check out process is smooth and easy.
Can't wait to book again for a third trip 😎🍾😄",5,2016,07,02
119,unusual hotel,"The yacht is absolutely beautiful. Our room was spacious and well equipped. Molten Brown in the shower,very nice.
The bar and restaurant overlook the back of the ship, very nice apart from the rain.
Staff all very friendly.",5,2016,07,01
119,"Beautiful yacht, great location.","The Sunborn is a beautiful yacht in a great location.  It’s like enjoying a cruise without the seasickness and rocking! The cabins are spacious and well-furnished as is the bathroom. There is a bar with great views across the Thames and the breakfast buffet was excellent. The only thing that let it down was the staff, they seemed rather aloof and forgetful.",4,2016,06,29
119,To go up the shard,"This a fabulous boat hotel even as you walk in the reseption  staff are excellent especially Mayriam a chuckily lady 
The main stair case is all glass and brass rail impressive .
The rooms with the river side and balconies are best .we didn't eat theie preferring a steak restaurant up the road .

If there was a downside would be the air planes taking of and landing at the very near city airport ,they don't run al night stopping at a decent hour and the doors are very heavy to open on the boat that is 

It's a good location for the shard walk up the dock side go across the dock on the cable car (great views and the planes landing and taking of ) jump on a river taxi and they go quite fast up the river and do the Same return trip

Would we go back there !!!!!! In a heart beat",5,2016,06,29
119,All aboard for a trip to nowhere ...,"Booked as the venue for a special event the Sunborn did not disappoint. Permanently moored near the Excel exhibition centre the hotel has a bar open to the public, with some outdoor seating for those balmy summer days [if you pick the right 2 days in a British Summer] and the prices are modest for London, or you can book a table for lunch or dinner and the food is excellent.
Friendly staff and good service complement the cruise ship atmosphere.
Great place to visit or stay overnight. The rooms are of good size and specification.",5,2016,06,28
119,excellent,"If you are a tourist and want to come and stay here, get the Clipper boat and then the Cable Car.  You will not be disappointed,  Beautiful rooms, very friendly efficient staff.
Beautiful bar, excellent facilities.  Try and ask for a river view room.  We have stayed her and been here a few times.  The only negative - if you don't like lifts ask the staff to let you out via another route.  Our lift got stuck last year and the engineer came and let us out.  In a confined space, I nearly had a panic attack.",5,2016,06,28
119,Sunborn hotel,Very pleasant experience.. Rooms very spacious even for families. A special atmosphere. Food very good. Drinks fairly pricy but to be expected. Look on group in for deals before you book as you could get a better deal. Close to emirates skyline and excel west field shopping centre about 10 minutes in taxi. Greenwich about 15 minute drive fir the cutty Sark and O2..,4,2016,06,28
119,Business lunch,"A most unique experience. This beautiful boat was right next to London Excel and a wonderful venue for a business lunch (for 50). We had a presentation room which was fairly small as one would expect on a boat but well laid out and beautifully serviced - water, still and sparkling, on the tables and tea and coffee near the door. The staff were really great - friendly, professional and generous. The food, served as a buffet in a bright room with an incredible view, looked incredible and was just delicious. Could not find fault with my experience here at all. Lovely venue. ",5,2016,06,28
119,Large Rooms in an Far Away Neighborhood,"If you need to stay in the Royal Victoria Docklands, this hotel offers very large rooms (for a London hotel) overlooking the water.  The rooms are very clean, in good order, and the facility is well maintained.  The atmosphere feels like ""high 1990s"" style, with too much chrome and awkward modern furniture, so I would not call it sophisticated, but upscale.  The Royal Victoria Dockyards, in case you don't need to stay there, is an uninteresting area of the city offering very few restaurants and night life.  I would recommend that travelers attending events at Excel or The Crystal stay in a more interesting part of London and ride the tube and DLR to the area.  The Jubilee line offers the most direct service between the Docklands and more vibrant parts to town.",4,2016,06,27
119,Overpriced!,"Stayed here at the weekend with my partner, checking in receptionist was very blunt and unwelcoming, nice enough room with a nice view, bed was comfy, however considering the price I paid the room was very tired looking, plastic part on shower fell off after using it for no longer then a minute, mini bar in room consisted of 2 small bottles of water. Decided to avoid the restaurant as the a la carte menu prices were ridiculous so ate out at a restaurant nearby, however we decided to have a few drinks in the bar in the evening, £20 for 4 small bottles of Perroni's! Checking out receptionist tried to charge us additional £20 for apparent room upgrade which I refused to pay as I don't believe this was confirmed when checking in and I had already forked out £300 for a one night stay! ",3,2016,06,27
119,Fantastic!,"We boarded the Sunborn to have a meal in the restaurant for my birthday. We were treated exceptionally well. The food was delicious and the service was second to none. Peter was outstanding and kept our Champagne topped up :-)
We will definately be returning in the future.",5,2016,06,27
119,Nothing was too much trouble. It couldn't get any better!,"A very rare visit to the Capital & three nights of bliss. . Spacious cabin, enormous bed, balcony & sitting area. Transport links couldn't be easier, whatever you want to visit or wherever you want to go. The view after dark is stunning especially with the Emirates cable car crossing the river,(a trip well worth taking especially if you want  the O2) Dining in makes for very relaxed evenings, Great breakfast buffet,  Reception;  in particular one young Sandra B couldn't have been more helpful as was the entire team on duty in all departments throughout our stay, including I.T. should you need it. Just fabulous from start to finish.Close your eyes sitting out on the open deck on the aft end, you  could be ""transported"" to any port in the world!   Car parking nearby is not part of the hotel but should you want it  £15 per 24hr in London. Oh my!",5,2016,06,25
119,Comfy bed,"Stayed on the Sunborn for three nights. Nice rooms with balcony. Comfy beds, hot shower, very quite considering where it is. The breakfast was very good with excellent views over to Canary Wharf. Reception staff were excellent But the bar and bar staff was disorganised. Would I stay again....Yes!",5,2016,06,25
119,Average overpriced stay,I stayed here with my partner whilst in London for 3 nights we paid £340 per night (the first night didn't include breakfast ) we were very disappointed the room was spacious and had a nice large comfy bed but was no different to any other room in a average hotel room we expected more for the price we paid we also thought for the price you would of got a bath instead we got a basic walk in shower however the breakfast was delicious and had a great choice however the hotel was a bit outside the centre for us so unfortunately we won't be back ,3,2016,06,25
119,Great stay ,"My husband and I stayed on the Sunborn as part of a groupon package. We upgraded to a riverside view which was lovely and had breakfast and dinner included. The bar area is really nice and cosy, staff are very attentive, the evening meal was very nice two, although the service was a little slow at times. Staff very professional and friendly.
Would recommend this hotel, it's easy to get to and lovely to just relax  and enjoy the view.
The breakfast was lovely, and so was the coffee. Would stay again.",5,2016,06,25
119,We Will be Back,"We went for our Wedding Anniversary last Sunday (Room 3045) and we would never forget the food, the facilities. 
Only downside for us: we book it for one night.

Would definitely come back for more than one night.
Utterly Brilliant Experience and would recommend to anyone who has the opportunity to go",5,2016,06,24
119,really good location,"the hotel is situated in a lovely position and the room was vast, the bed big and really comfortable, the shower was very powerful. However be careful if you drink in the bar, 3 small lagers were £16.85!. Breakfast were very expensive. Eat ashore, just down the road we had 2 full English for £4.95 each. I would recommend this hotel if visiting the 02.",4,2016,06,24
119,Sunborn London for Excel exhibition,"Incredible experience, convenient to Excel Exhibition.. Staff were incredibly helpful and polite..Only downside i dont like London Drinks prices ...Rooms were spacious and well laid out ...Breakfast was a great Buffet ...nice to see good quality bacon and sausages ( a definite rarity in London) We booked this hotel at a really special price in advance and i would look out for the offer again",5,2016,06,24
119,Great service and great views - but afternoon tea is nothing special,"Okay - so I really LOVE afternoon tea and I chose the Sunborn for its location near to the cable car.  The service was very good, the view was excellent - across the dock to the City and beyond, watching paddle-boarders and water skiers on the water (and sometimes in the water!).  It was quiet on a Sunday and we had a table at the front of the restaurant with uninterrupted views.  
So far so good.  We ordered ahead for a vegan tea: some very nice vegan sandwiches, followed by sliced melon? No effort to make vegan scones or cake, somewhat takes away the point of afternoon tea.  The non vegan afternoon tea was okay - the sandwiches were fine but unexceptional, the scones (plain, one small scone per person with jam from a jar and thick cream) were warm and there were three small cakes each.  We had a miniature cream cone, an average brownie and a very good but very small macaron.  I was recommended hot chocolate - very good, and it was replenished for free.  
It felt like the afternoon tea was just for tourists who don't know what to expect. As I said the service and the view were very good but I wouldn't go back for afternoon tea.",3,2016,06,24
119,Go to for the bar,"We visited whilst at ExCEL for a few drinks with colleagues staying on the Sunborn. The weather was fantastic and we sat out on the deck and enjoyed a few drinks. There is no draught beer on the Sunborn, it is only bottles but they do have a great selection. The staff were good as well. It is not cheap but you certainly pay for the experience. It can be loud once every so often with London City Airport being close by, however we knew that and didn't mind at all.",5,2016,06,24
119,Birthday celebration,"Booked this yatch to spend some time checking London out! Fabulous yatch great staff
 Rooms very spacious almost opulent ! Food fabulous with great attentive staff
! A bit further out of London, but that can be a benifit as the DLR is nearby! 
There's so much to see and to around here! 
Great. John views",5,2016,06,23
119,A Hotel Stay with a difference!,"We stayed at the Sunborn for our Honeymoon night and had booked the Romantic Getaway package. We weren't disappointed, real rose petals on our bed, chocolates and hand written card from the reception staff wishing us well. Room was spacious and very well presented with the bonus of Molten Brown products in the bathroom.
The bar manager made a personalised liqueur for us both, beautifully presented when they found out we were newlyweds. The food for both dinner and breakfast was lovely, presentation again was lovely.
The whole experience was lovely, made all the more pleasant by exceptional staff inn all areas.
We will be returning!",4,2016,06,23
119,Amazing,"I booked this as part of my partners birthday present and WOW! This place is amazing

We had a riverview! The rooms are absolutely stunning! As it was my partners birthday ot was a nice touch to have balloons and banners and also a lovely victoria sponge cake upon arrival! 

The staff for attentive and engaging

I would definitely recommend this especially for couples who want something different than just a hotel",5,2016,06,22
119,Afternoon tea - not likely,"Booked a what I thought typical English afternoon tea experience for visitors from abroad.
Restaurant was really quiet, only 3 tables occupied.we were greeted by not too friendly staff,showed to our table, menue shoved in front of us no explanation of any sort anything we asked was answered with no interest.
Tea was nicely presented and that's where it stopped everything after that was just awful.
Sandwiches, scones & jam, and desserts all came at the same time,and looked as they were just chucked on the plate,yes all was served on a white cheap looking plate, no cake stand and no nice sandwich display.Table was so crowded , so awkward to eat.
Sandwiches were not fresh ate 2or3 then moved on to the desserts,brownies rock hard,the rest old and sorry looking,however scones were quiet nice
Complained to the supervisor and was told they had an accident in the kitchen everything got broken,hello that should not stop you serving good food with pleasant service.
So embarrassing  to come here with guests and get something that has no resemblance to what was advertised on their website.
Asked to see the manager , was left waiting for 10minutes with no one around ,seemed that staff mistiriously dissapeard .
Finally meeting the manager he was very apologetic and handled the situation well , although we didn't have to pay , whole afternoon was ruined.,",2,2016,06,22
119,Hotel with a difference.,"We stayed here on the night of the 5th of June as part of a GB Tours excursion. 
As the hotel is a yacht I was not quite sure what to expect in term's of layout, although fair to say I expected some sort of deck arrangement leading to the cabins. Boxed in somehow because of H & S.  However, it's not like that. To enter you travel to the 3rd deck reception using small lifts. When you go to your room it is by walking along internal corridors. At this point you would not know you were on a yacht. It's like walking along a corridor in a land based hotel. The room is a large, having a bed area, en-suite and settee lounge area. The room has tv, free wifi, drink making facilities and the bed was comfortable. Breakfast was the usual type of buffet and quite acceptable. I did not have an evening meal as I did not think there was much choice on the menu. There are plenty of places to eat a short walk away and I used one of the street vans on the dock side. I did have a drink in the lounge which is at the rear of the yacht. Be careful, not cheap! I suspected something was up when I when to the bar to check out the beers on tap, only there were none!!!  Service comes to the table with a priced menu. Just for the experience I had a 330ml (small) Peroni..... £5.00 + 12.5% service charge! That's £5.63 !  Another couple close by were surprised that their two drinks were just short of £12    :-)
Rooms are air conditioned which is noisy when trying to sleep. For some reason our's would not turn off. 
The yacht is moored in Victoria dock and I assume firmly anchored to land as I never felt any movement.
I'm not sure how many ""stars"" it has but in my opinion  3 to 3.5 would be enough.
It's position is good. 3 minutes walk to the Excel centre and a cable car ride (£9 return I think) to Greenwich which is well worth a visit if you like hustle and bussle markets and streets. The Cutty Sark and National Maritime museum are there.
Quite a nice hotel but expensive if you have to pay the full rate. Even some of the last minute deals were expensive, typically £160 night.
I did notice a ramp on the bottom deck to the outside so I assume there is some disabled access but check it out.",3,2016,06,22
119,Stunning ,Great location for a conference and overnight stay with a backdrop of Canary Wharf. Great catering for over a hundred people. The bedrooms are truly wonderful with more space than I expected and everything you need for your stay! The breakfast was amazing.,5,2016,06,21
119,Beautiful hotel,"Only stayed  overnight  but this place is a real gem. The yacht is stunning and the surrounding area is fab also. Right near the Emirates cable car so great for the 02 arena.
The reception area is beautiful and the bar area looks out over the London skyline. Will be going back soon.",5,2016,06,20
119,Pleasant stay,"I was fortunate to get a discounted stay at the Sunborn. The riverside room was a very good size and the bed comfortable.
Breakfast was a disappointment - not particularly hot.
The staff were excellent on the reception desk. However, whilst it was a pleasant stay I probably won't rush back. I'd have been unhappy had I paid full price. The bar is particularly expensive and somehow this place doesn't quite deliver.",4,2016,06,20
119,Nice but could improve,"We just returned home from an over night stay.The room was lovely and very spacious the bed was big and comfortable.The hotel staff are nice and will do their best to welcome you.The only problem we had was with the food unfortunately it was very disappointing.It not what you would expect from 4*.The presentation was good but sadly that's as far as it went.I sent my starter back and was hoping my main would be better,which it wasn't.The beef was dry,chewy and tasteless.I went to bed hungry and dreading breakfast,However I have to say Breakfast was really nice and lots on offer.The staff poached my eggs for me when I asked and they came out fast.I would stay again in hope my evening meal was just an unfortunate experience.",4,2016,06,20
119,What a backdrop!,"We had a one night stay as a treat and that's how it felt.  luxurious large room, huge fluffy towels, attentive staff and the most fabulous view of Canary Wharf as a backdrop to our late night cocktails",5,2016,06,20
119,Spoilt at the sunborn !,"A fantastic stay at the Sunborn London, all the staff were helpful and friendly and had a good knowledge of the area.
The yacht itself is beautiful and immaculate inside,  the bed was so comfortable i didn't want to go out for dinner, I would suggest to take a room on the riverside as we had a fantastic view of the Thames especially in the evening.  We didn't eat dinner on the yacht but did have breakfast and again wonderful staff, excellent selection of both continental and full English.
I will be booking again very soon but this time it will be for the whole weekend not just 1 night.",5,2016,06,20
119,Delicious food,"I am. It sure wether to review just the restaurant or that and the hotel etc and I am not sure if can separate them so will just do them together.

The hotel is novel, I liked the fact it is a boat because it just feels like you are going on holiday! The accommodation was nice with a balcony, view of the river, and inside we had a sofa area. 

The restaurant had cosy lighting which I like, the tables were a little two much on top of each other which I don't love specially when you can hear the people talking next to you. 

I had saddle of lamb which was delicious, it had a carrot on there which had an amazing chargrilled taste. My wife had the salmon with muscles, that was very nice but could have done with a bit of sauce.
The bread and garlic butter was delicious I kept asking for more butter!
My wife had a chocolate desert which was out of this world!

The food really was quality at dinner time, but breakfast wasn't so, it was just average low quality, I really enjoyed salami on bread though and some smoked salmon.

It wasn't a cheap deal but it was different and the first hotel boat I have been on.

(I wish I knew how to rotate images on trip advisor on my phone!?)",5,2016,06,20
119,Treat,"Stayed here for one night, check in was quick and receptionist was welcoming and friendly. We were on a groupon deal so upgraded to a river view for £20, the rom was very nice and spacious , your feet sank into the carpet. Clean and nicely decorated. Food and drink quite expensive, but there is quite a few restaurants outside. There's nothing to do in the area except the cable cars. You are very near city airport so planes going over a lot but you get used to that and they stop about 9.00pm. Definitely worth a visit. ",5,2016,06,20
119,Afternoon tea !!!,"What a shame. Came up to London today for what could have been a wonderful experience, leaving bitterly disappointed.
No nice presentation as in all website photos , sandwiches dry and deserts were made yesterday and tasted like it too!

Staff seemed uninterested when we informed them and offered no substitute cakes ......",1,2016,06,20
119,I do not normally write reviews.,"My partner and i stayed on the sunborn on the 15th June 2016 in room 4023. We caught the train to marlybone station then jumped onto the jubliee line (siver line) on the tube and got off at the 02 arena. We then went over the river on the emirates cable cars lovely views and you could see the yacht as you came over. The yacht looked beautiful just like it did in the pictures and as we went up the lift to the reception and was very kindly greeted by Vadim who was brilliant. Our room was perfect loads of space super-king bed heated floors in the bathroom. We ordered dinner @5pm however changed it as it was a bit too early to 6.30. Our table was perfect and the food was unbelievable. The only issue i had was that i found a small hair in my side dish. they offered to cook the whole meal again which i declined as i was pretty full up, they offered free deserts again we declined as we was pretty full up. So they said both our meals are for free and also offered us a free drink in the bar as an apology. The service you receive on the yacht is unbelievable all of the staff are a credit to the hotel. very polite and very professional. In the morning we had a full English breakfast and it was delicious. i asked kindly if they could cook us some poached eggs which they kindly obliged too. I would go back again and i would definitely recommend the sunborn as one of the best places to stay in London. Give it a go you will not be disappointed.",5,2016,06,20
119,Staff could not have been kinder or more helpful,"Booked last minute for afternoon tea today (Sunday) to celebrate a special birthday.  Weather unpredictable but warm and blustery when we arrived.  Previous table occupants tardy leaving but staff offered to set us up on the outer deck in the sunshine.  Lovely food (Under the Sea menu all round), generous serving of champagne, variety of teas and no smirks when one ordered coffee (!) and refills / water on demand.  
An excellent afternoon, with the offer of seats in the bar later to warm up....lovely...go  - spoil yourself - pretend you're in Cannes!",5,2016,06,19
119,Unique hotel in superb location,"A had a very friendly welcome when we arrived. I had booked a long weekend to surprise hubby for our anniversary. We paid more to upgrade to a river view with balcony which was well worth it. We had a spacious, well appointed room with a huge comfortable bed. The room was quiet and we slept well. We appreciated being near the city airport to watch the planes come and go, which stopped by night fall ;-). The breakfast was a buffet style, so you could really fill up if you so wished.
All in all a very enjoyable weekend away.",5,2016,06,19
119,Fantastic surprise stay💕 Loved it! ,"My hubby booked this stay as a surprise months ago and I loved it! I was eager to get aboard when we arrived and I was not disappointed, thank you! We upgraded for £20 to an Executive room with a view of the Thames. Worth it! 💕 

We had fun looking around our room with the view of the Thames! Fantastic! Great comfy bed and amenities. I would have preferred more coffee and milk put in the rooms as a coffee drinker!

Lovely evening meal, delicious and we even got Prosseco instead of wine! We could have easily sat in the bar admiring the views but no off to a show ""The Lion King"" with a taxi called for us by the hotel! Thank you, Perfect to see London without the stress of driving or the busy underground!

After the show we arrived back to the boat/hotel and purchased a bottle of Prosecco (£40) but worth every penny to sit back and take in the night views of the Thames and London on the deck outside. 💕There were a few noisy revellers who disturbed our tranquillity and even woke us again at 4am in the morning but it didn't spoil our stay too much. Attentive staff, a lovely cooked breakfast and delicious coffee made up for the lack of sleep! I would recommend! 💕

We did ask about stating another night but were told it was £199 without anything else so we declined, shame!

My hubby and I loved our stay, the food, the views and the tranquility of the location! We would love to stay again but not for £199 with no breakfast!

119,Amazing,"Found this place on TripAdvisor and was instantly amazed by the cool idea of staying on a yacht. Stayed here with my girlfriend. 
As you approach you're welcomed by a gold colour lift and welcomed up to the reception. Receptionists are very professional and offer a 'want to help' approach. 
Went back in the lift and then used the room key to go onto the right floor (good security). 
The room is bright, fun and clean. The bathroom has a heated floor - ideal after you hop out the shower. 
Had dinner at 7pm and the food was beautiful. When it gets dark the boat is nicely lit. 
Breakfast again nice (Buffett style) and the staff wanted to make you feel welcomed. 
Over all a brilliant stay and worth trying out. ",5,2016,06,16
119,Great Groupon Deal!,"Visited the Sunborn with friends, it's looking a little tired in places, but a pleasant experience. Dinner was beautiful really super food. Breakfast was ok. Staff were super polite and friendly no problems at all. A nice experience just wouldn't rush back.",3,2016,06,16
119,One of those experiences that you simply never forge,"I booked 7 twin rooms at the hotel for my friend's hen night, totalling fourteen guests. Each one of us agree totally that the entire experience was one that you simply remember always and one that undoubtedly prompts you to return, So content were we, that six of us stayed an extra night. The venue oozes glamour, the rooms are clean and spacious and there is pure decadence everywhere. The crockery, cutlery and glassware are simply divine, which just adds to the glamour of the place. 
From the first instance of making the reservation to the actual check out, we were treated with respect, courtesy and helpfulness. 
This can be summarised by the fact that it became quickly a home away from home.
Amazing cocktails need a mention, in particular the 'porn star martinis.' We indulged in afternoon tea, with the most wonderful tea bags, packed individually in pyramid shaped boxes and a very varied choice of breakfast. 
Took the names of some of the employees we were privileged to meet, who deserve a mention: Agne, Julian, Raul, Jay, Isabella, Lency and Timea, thank you for an amazing memory.
Overall, a perfect experience, with amazing views and the added touch of knowing you're on a yacht. Sunborn, will see you soon, stock up on passion fruits please......",5,2016,06,16
119,The Worst Hotel,"From checking in to the worst experience ever. Reception rude staff unwilling to help.
Compared to the Sunborn Gibraltar this is nothing compared to that in terms of service and professionalism. This is infact a 2 star hotel as the heating in the room doesn't work. Premiere inn is better then this hotel. Staff just unfriendly and useless. Absolutely disappointed. Hated every moment of my stay here. Never again. Don't come and waste your money here.",1,2016,06,15
119,First impression let it down,"We arrived at the Sunborn Yacht hotel around 4.30pm, after travelling since 11am that morning. Took the lift to the 3rd floor where we were greeted by a receptionist which obviously was not in her second nature to smile. She reeled off a lot of instructions , nothing seemed personal as she spoke. We were given our room key  for 4033. When we arrived to our room which was an executive suite , we were surprised to find we had been double booked with a swarm of flies. Not just one or two but about 10, all around the air conditioning. I know we had booked out break through groupon but expected better than this. Want back down to the reception, same receptionist😡 explained the situation. She looked at the system and asked again ""so what is wrong with your room"" . I said again there are flies in our room, another member of staff was behind her who did not lift an eyebrow when I said this. And  when she did actually say sorry it was very flippant . By this point I was losing my patience, I was tired and wanting to get to my room as I had made plans to meet family at 5.30 and then have a meal at 6.30. Finally she handed me a key for room 5027 and stated it will not have a chair but a desk . Did not really understand what she meant but by then I just wanted to get myself freshened up . It was 5.10pm by the time we got to put room,  it seemed ok , very clean but slightly smaller than the first.  But had no flies so grateful, we got ready and want downstairs to meet out family. Bar staff were excellent and went out of their way to make you feel comfortable and the same for the lands end restaurant,  excellent meal , great value for money and staff who you could see really did enjoy their job. 
After a pleasant evening we returned to put room, whilst waiting for the bathroom I was browsing on the tablet and then I'd came to my attention that we had actually been DOWN GRADED to a classic room instead of something similar to what was originally booked. It was a shame we had that first impression and our complaint not managed appropriately, especially when the bar and restaurant have everything down to a fine art. ",3,2016,06,15
119,Nice enough,"We booked this for one night as a base for a trip into town.

The nearest car park was about 5 mins walk away and costs £15 per day. The DLR is about 2 mins away at the Excel centre.

Reception staff were friendly and we could leave out case with them whilst we went to town, as we arrived before actual check in.

We had a room facing the Excel which was quite big and very clean. Bed was actually surprisingly comfy and shower nice and clean. Very few toiletries available, nothing in mini bar at all and no biscuits or snacks available.

The room contained no literature as to facilities available or meal times.

We had dinner on board. The waiters were very polite set all meals and service good. The food itself was very limited in choice for vegetarian and I would not recommend the restaurant if you are veggie. Other meal choices seemed OK if you like meat.

Coffee was £12.50 per cup and 4 small bread basket tolls were £4.

Breakfast was a good choice of full English, fruit, cereals and toast and service good.

On checking out, at least 4 people ourselves included had trouble with charges to their rooms, but staff politely sorted things out.

A pleasant stay, good service, clean rooms and good, quiet location, albeit not a pretty view.",4,2016,06,14
119,Disappointment,My wife booked the Sunborn as a treat for a special birthday and we were looking forward to views from our room over the Thames. Instead our room (which is admittedly well appointed) Disappointingly looks over dry land with no river to be seen.  Might as well be in any old hotel.  We asked to change room but nothing was available.  We're determined to have a pleasant stay but I would advise anyone thinking of booking not to bother unless they can be sure of a Thames view - the whole point in coming here. Michael Hawkins,3,2016,06,14
119,Birthday treat,"on arrival we were made really welcome and very thing explained, room ,wifi meal tmes and floors for bar and restaurant. The room was large with tea and coffee , wifi and lovely shower and fluffy towels. We had a lovely meal in lands end restaurant which I booked before and then drinks in the bar. The breakfast had great choice but I had to pay separate for it but others had it paid for in their package",5,2016,06,13
119,Afternoon tea ,Afternoon tea was very nice. The staff were friendly and attentive. Drinks after in the bar which had a fantastic view and was very comfortable. The day visit has encouraged me to book a stay for an upcoming anniversary. ,4,2016,06,13
119,Amazing ,"What an amazing hotel! I booked this as a surprise for my boyfriends 21st birthday and it didn't disappoint. The lobby/reception area is incredible, takes your breath away as you walk in and the rooms are equally as amazing. The bar has a wide range of drinks and snacks although we chose to eat elsewhere. Breakfast is well worth the extra money, has a fantastic choice of hot and cold items and was great for me as a vegetarian. Already looking at when we can go back! ",5,2016,06,13
119,Fantastic!,Absolutely loved our stay aboard the Sunborn. Would totally recommend it. Bedroom was beautiful and we received a free upgrade on arrival to a river view. The Thames at night is glorious and the whole experience was magical. My fiancé arranged roses scattered on the bed and chocolates were waiting. Staff were helpful and efficient. Would I return!? Without a doubt.,5,2016,06,12
119,Wow,Took my partner to stay on this romantic boat and could not fault it from checking in to the nights stay everything was perfect. Room service is abit steap but what else can you expect from such a lavish hotel.,5,2016,06,12
119,Quirky,"We stayed here for a evening for my birthday, it is expensive for what it is if you take away the novelty of staying on a yacht moored in London. The suite we had was large and clean but lacking in final touches which would have justified the high price. Having the staff were very good and attentive",4,2016,06,12
119,Fantastic hotel shame the service let it down,"Had a wonderful weekend, rooms amazing and everywhere so clean.  Everything you have is subject to 12.5% service charge, where we found the service was the only thing that let it down.  Ordered two gin and tonics and waited 35 mins! Didn't mind as sat on deck in the sun. Breakfast so unorganised no glasses for the juices, no plates for the toast or pastries, no butter. Ran out of bacon, then eggs so waited for an age for more to come out.  Not blaming the staff think they all trying to juggle all jobs. Ordered 2 black coffees and one expresso!! Upgraded for a Thames view and so worth it.",4,2016,06,12
119,Even got lovely soft carpet in the rooms!,"Really nice and relaxing hotel. Rooms are great, service was great, no complaints at all. We got to know the barmen Alex and Jay who really made an effort to make us feel welcome every day. We will definitely stay here again.",5,2016,06,12
119,Zero customer service,"I stayed here recently for my brother-in-laws 40th.  I have to say that the lack of personal service for a 4 star was appalling.  My OH and I stayed in a standard dock view room which was large, clean and comfortable.  Upon arrival and check-in without a smile no information was given as to where we might find our room or on the amenities.  My sister and brother-in-law stayed in one of only two top executive rooms for the price they paid they should have received one to one personal service after all the video stream on the reception wall does state that you will experience executive extras. They weren't told how to use the sauna (which was turned off and should have been turned on for their arrival) or jacuzzi bath.

The bar service is extremely slow. My OH and I waited half an hour for one bottle of beer.

Upon check-out I heard someone else complaining about the total lack of service such a shame for a unique hotel.

Would be reluctant to stop here again.",3,2016,06,12
119,No wow factor ,"Stayed for one night 11/06 as a birthday treat for Mrs and was looking forward to a bit of extravagance and while the room was more than acceptable it was a bit of a let down interior is nice but it was basically the same decor as a newish static caravan, stains all over floor and the shower hose for the backside was black and filthy room 1025, also the view was errm great for a river rat.

Don't get me wrong the yacht itself is impressive and I would stay again as the price is only slightly more than a standard hotel and staff were very helpful.

I think it is that I had an expectation before I checked in and it didn't quite match up so if you visit the hotel just take it as a normal hotel and you may walk away happier than me.",3,2016,06,12
119,Zero service at Sundown Bar,"We came for a quick lunch at the bar as the restaurant was full. We ordered mushroom soup that took 40 minutes to arrive. The soup was spicy and looked more like a dark broth of an onion soup. Caesar salad was not fresh with soggy, tired looking Romaine lettuce, croutons were too large and chunky. 
Service was slow and uncoordinated. Very disappointing. ",1,2016,06,11
119,Lovely short stay,"We booked this for our honeymoon and paid a little extra for a riverside view, something we would recommend. Rooms were very nice, head maid checks daily whether you are happy with her staff's work,
Bar staff friendly. Cocktails were nice.
Restaurant staff were very accommodating and professional. When booking they thought to ask if we were celebrating a special occasion. They then ensured our meal was extra special.",4,2016,06,10
119,Amazing,"We visited the Sunborn for a three day brake to celebrate our wedding anniversary,  having read about the hotel  in various articles and on Tripadviser. This really is a beautifully appointed luxury yacht originally built in Finland as a Spa, no engines so floated to London Docks and moored as a hotel tewo years ago.
From the moment we stepped aboard to the time we left the staff could not have been kinder or more polite and helpful.  A beautiful room (cabin) overlooking the water and so quiet and peaceful. The first and second night we ate dinner in the restaurant again with impeccable service and the food was excellent and well priced.
Not possible I know but if we could we would rate this hotel, service, location, staff, amenities and restaurant as 12 out of 10 and if we return to London this will be our venue.",5,2016,06,09
119,Amazing Experience,"Mr Jon C Everett and Miss Vaiva Podziute, 

Just recently returned from a two night break on this fantastic yacht hotel and we were blown away with just how amazing it was. From the moment we stepped on the yacht to the moment we checked out we were made to feel very special. The friendliness and helpfulness of the staff was 5star. Our luggage was even taken to our room by the professional friendly staff as we completed our paperwork at reception. Opening the door to our room and seeing everything was spotless and clean with high attention to detail including Molton Brown accessories in the bathroom we just knew it was going to be a pleasure to stay. On the yacht itself the cleanliness and phenomenal brass detail around the place was second to none. We enjoyed and evening meal in the restaurant which to our experience was again 5star from the service to the high quality presentation and taste of the delightful food. Full respect to the staff and there manager Ramoa for such a fantastically well organised hotel and a 5star experience. Will definitely be returning later in the year.
Mr J.C.Everett 07/06/2016
Miss V.Podziute 07/06/2016",5,2016,06,08
119,Brilliant Experience,"I treated my partner to an overnight stay as a birthday surprise. We had a fantastic time from start to finish lovely dinner and romantic drinks on our balcony which had stunning views of the City.
I would highly recommend this hotel for either a stay or just a visit to the bar which serves delicious cocktails.",5,2016,06,08
119,Mr M.J.Layford,"We have just visted this absolutely fantastic yacht and am pleased to advise to anybody wishing to visit that they will not be disappointed.The complete experience was mind blowing starting from the professional reception and all the staff were so helpful and so polite and made us feel so welcome the moment we stepped onto the yacht.The room was spotlessly clean with huge bed and very comfortable plenty of wardrobe space and space to relax,the complete shower room was immaculate and towels very soft and plenty of utilise from Molton Brown to use free of charge.The whole yacht I can quite honestly say that I've never been on such a clean and polished place ever from the carpets to the staff polishing the immaculate brass so you can see your reflection.The bar was lovely with plenty to offer for various drinks but what completed it for us was the service and the restaurant,the food should be awarded as its if the highest class and very reasonable priced.in my experience this should be no less than 5 star instead of been rated of 4 star.The manager was so helpful and so professional and I will be definitely be going back very shortly for my partners birthday in October of this year.
     Mr M.J.Layford 07/06/2016 ",5,2016,06,07
119,Another nice stay,"Third visit to the sunborn in London and as always it felt special, checked in earlier than 3pm with no issues and given some 25% off drink vouchers.
We did have to move rooms because of some selfish idiots next door who thought it was their own personal yacht and felt the need to shout about all afternoon but the front desk were very helpful in us making the switch and this was not their fault.
Think another year from now and it will need some new furniture in rooms and bar area and will probably need a spruce up to keep it up to standard. Thanks for another wonderful stay!",5,2016,06,07
119,Michael,"Stunning looking yacht but not so fancy inside. Made a booking 2 days before via booking.com (specified arrival time after 8pm) for family room with sofa, but upon arrival reception could not find a booking and after 20 minutes waiting (no drinks or coffee were offered) we were given small room at the end of bottom level which had very bad wifi and almost no phone network. Staff didn't show us bar or a restaurant or anything else, they literally couldn't be bothered. Disappointing experience.",3,2016,06,06
119,Very disappointing!,"Friday 3rd June 2016
Stayed 2 nights  in the executive suite for my husbands 40th bday.

Good points:
Perfect setting
Room is spacious and large terrace over looking the river.
Bathroom has a double shower, Jacuzzi bath and sauna.
King size bed so comfortable.
All the accommodation was Spotless.

Bad points:
Welcome of hotel not good, very slow, no smile and greet, no info given at all about what the hotel has to offer.
Bar area, carpets and sofas need a little attention looking a little worn for a four star.
Staff in bar slow, again no hello or smile when entering the bar or being served they seemed unfriendly and disinterested. 
Room, no minibar, tablet was not in the room, room was cold and heating blowing cold in the living area although working  in the bedroom.
Sauna off and no advice on how using this when we checked in, however called reception a few times, finally getting an answer the young man came to our room he  was polite and showed us how to use it.
This was the only time I felt that the service  was good.

5/5 for the setting and suite
1/5 Customer service

The Customer Service shocking for a four star.
We love London and will return but Sadly we will not return or recommend this hotel to our friends or family, for the money we paid it was a big let down.

I can see a lot of the people that are not happy are all complaining about the same thing, the CUSTOMER SERVICE and see that the reply they get is they will look into these complaints, but it's obviously not been dealt with. As your all in hospitality you know that Customer Service should be your priority if you would like your guests to return.
",2,2016,06,06
119,A Touch of Style,"Just had a wonderful experience at the Sunborn Yacht Hotel Custom House, Excel.  Despite being someway out of central London in the East End it was in a super position, very tranquil and pretty.  Accommodation, bars and restaurant very comfortable and of a high standard.  The reception area is very lush with its winding staircase to the next floor and dining room.  All the staff were very pleasant and friendly and the outside bar areas a treat (made so much better by the sun that shone for us). Short walk to DLR and Emirates cable car making for easy travelling around London and the O2.  My only disappointment was the service at Breakfast, tables not cleared, no plates and glasses on hand and had to ask twice for our tea.  The food on the other hand was good quality produce and very enjoyable.  There was a lot of waiting around for eggs.  Besides this I would give this hotel 10 out of 10 and look forward to returning for another break.",5,2016,06,06
119,Great staff making it an amazing time ... thanks to brian & Vadim,"The whole experience was just fab from start to finish , we had the most brilliant time even though the weather was not great the staff made every effort to make us happy .. thank you brian for the restaurant service funny and chatty , and Vadim on the front desk thank you from Christine & Keith/",5,2016,06,05
119,Excellent Hotel with a lovely style,"Me and my girlfriend went here for a 2 night visit as a birthday suprise. Everything about the hotel was great. Very clean, and friendly not one member of staff including the cleaning team failed to say hello. 

We were a little worried about rocking and sea sickness however this was not an issue at all, also we were worried to be close to London Airport however once inside the hotel not one plane could be heard!",5,2016,06,05
119,Something a little bit different,"I wanted to book something a little bit different as a birthday surprise for my husband. This ticked the box - a hotel on a yacht! It is permanently moored so there is no movement on board the yacht. It has an impressive reception area with sweeping staircases and huge chandeliers. The room was lovely, very spacious. We had dinner in the restaurant which was lovely, highly recommended. We also had breakfast on board the yacht which was equally as good. There's not too much to do in the area although it is only a cable car ride across to the O2 and a very short walk to the Excel Centre. However, we stayed on a very windy November evening so the cable cars were closed! But we were there to relax and that's exactly what we did!",4,2016,06,04
119,Hotel on a Yacht,"Very convenient if you are visiting Excel or O2 Dome as it's moored (permanently) at Victoria Dock. As it's permanently moored there is no motion of the ship, it's as solid as if it were on land, well soundproofed rooms too so no worry about aircraft noise from City Airport. The rooms and public areas are well maintained and clean, beds comfortable and usual hotel facilities provided. The restaurant food is good, a decent menu and well cooked. Bar has a good selection of wines and spirits but only bottled beer. To sum up, the good points are: it's an interestingly different hotel which provides a good level of service, the not so good are: it's better in summer when you can be out on deck without freezing and the area has little of interest beyond Excel and O2.",4,2016,06,03
119,Birthday lunch,"My son and I went there for the set lunch as an early birthday for him. Beautiful setting despite the cloudy cold weather for June. Great service, I was unsure about the soup so they very kindly offered us a taster before ordering. It was nice but I opted for the goats cheese starter, salmon and a divine cheesecake whereas my son went for the sweetbreads, pork cheek that was delicious and chocolate parfait that was to due for. Very good value in fab surroundings, will definitely be back. The afternoon tea looked amazing! ",5,2016,06,03
119,Disappointing ,"We stayed at the Sunborn on 2nd June for one night and whilst I cannot fault the look of the hotel, the views, the room we were allocated and the customer service we received the food was absolutely diabolical and VERY expensive for what was served! I have no problem paying money for any experience I book or for quality food, but my husband and I both expected a lot more than we got. £26 for a cold main course where half of the ingredients were practically raw. Potatoes which looked lovely, but again cold and rubbery as if reheated and some green inedible stuff? My husbands meal was £32 for a small piece of sirloin steak which although was tender had no flavour and was definitely not worth that amount of money. £4.50 each for small bowl of vegetables so £9 for two spoons for peas and carrots. I expect to pay above the norm when staying in such a hotel and in the location it is situated, but I also expected a certain standard for the price charged. As mentioned before I have no issue with paying top money for top food and from the look of the hotel and the prices charged we were looking forward to eating at the Sunborn and thought our meal would be enjoyable, we were sadly disappointed. There is a large selection at breakfast cereals, pastries, cooked food. However, the cooked food was cold and again at £20 a breakfast I expected it to be above room temperature. I know i sound like one of the people who review and find fault over the slightest thing, but I'm really not. Would I go back again?? To sit on the deck have a drink and look at the view most definitely yes as the hotel is relaxing and has a lovely atmosphere. To pay £249 for a room and be served inedible food/food which doesn't match the standard of rest of the hotel no I most definitely wouldn't. ",3,2016,06,03
119,Yachtastic!,"Stayed for one night for other half's birthday and booked a river view room. We were pleasantly surprised by the size of the room, the massive king size bed and the views of the Emirates skyline. Instead of a hotel folder, there was a nifty tablet affair to answer queries and book services such as the spa or room service. The stay was comfortable and surprisingly quiet! The location was great for hopping on the skyline and having cocktails over at the O2.
Breakfast was on the expensive side but was a buffet of hot and cold to be enjoyed on the back of the boat. 
The only shock of our stay was departing on Sunday to find the X Factor auditions queue!",5,2016,06,01
119,Surpassed our expectations,"Have just returned from a night at the Sunborn yacht hotel, an experience we can thoroughly recommend. The room was perfect, pristine with great facilities. Rarely have we slept in a more comfortable bed and in a quieter room.  The restaurant staff were exceptionally attentive, especially Ben, and the reception staff welcoming and helpful, particularly Romao who went out of his way to make my wife's birthday special. Cannot wait to return for a longer stay.  If you are looking to stay in a more unusual hotel this is the one for you. ",5,2016,06,01
119,Sunborn Treat,"Romantic stay - setting is absolutely lovely, room was fantastic, food was delicious, good bar and excellent staff who are friendly and attentive. Well worth treating yourself to this hotel. Location is a bit out of town but this just made us take a river taxi and cable car to get there which all add to a great stay.",5,2016,06,01
119,"Great Stay, Great location. Surprisingly quiet...","Stayed here for the MCM Comic Con.  It's a yacht, so that's a bit different! Nice views of the O2 and Canary Wharf off the back of the ship bar, cocktails are about 10 pounds (average price).  All in all, not the cheapest hotel near the Excel, but would defiantly stay again.",5,2016,05,30
119,A special place to stay in London,"Had a night in an Executive River View room to finish off an evening at the O2.  Ideally located for using the Emirates Air Line cable car to the 02.  Great night time views of London on the return trip at night.  Room was very spacious, clean and well equipped.  Nice to have a small balcony too. Seemed to be plenty off staff around to help and the service was first class. We had the afternoon tea and breakfast on the yacht, both of which were good but not excellent. Overall, expensive but I would definitely stay here again.",5,2016,05,30
119,First class hotel,"We booked the Sunborn via a Secret Escapes email. Like most people these days, we never purchase anything at the original price and hotels also come under this advice. We got an upgraded suite, breakfast and a three course dinner plus a bottle of champagne in our cabin. We were greeted well at the hotel early in the morning as we dropped off our luggage and went directly into town for a day in London. Remember that the Emirates flyer in 5 minutes walk away which will transport you across the Thames to catch the Clipper boat/taxt west towards the City. Arriving back late afternoon we checked into our beautiful cabin. Everything is here that you could possibly require. The only issues are...1) London City Airport runway thresshold is very close indeed and the Sunborn is on the approach flightpath. This means it is VERY NOISEY from 0600 to 2300hrs. 2) You MUST book your restaurant time well ahead of time. We were lucky and gained a 6pm time. One of the last, other than this iot was 2130hrs. Far too late for us. In fairness the Sunborn allowed us to drink our free Champagne at our table. On the whole it was a first class stay in a well situated hotel. We will certainly use this hotel again. PS: Make sure there is not a show on at the Excell if you are planning to stay mid week.",5,2016,05,29
119,Spa and dinner break,"I visited the hotel with 3 friends and we all had a wonderful time. The staff are exceptionally helpful and friendly, the hotel is  unique, exceptionally clean and the food is excellent.  We all had a treatment in the spa which was lovely.  The view over the river was great.  We can't wait to go back again! I would highly recommend this hotel if you just want a relaxing time away or a great place to stay if you want to visit the sights of London.  ",5,2016,05,28
119,Great for the O2 arena & excel centre ,"Stayed here for on a Friday night in October, to see Michael McIntyre at the O2. Paid for a harbour view room and was given one on the 1st floor (bottom of the boat). Room was spacious, clean and comfortable. Really close to the Excel Centre (a stones throw) and a short walk (5 mins) to the Emirates Skyline, for a 10 minute trip over the Thames, which drops you off right next to the O2 arena. Unfortunately, there was a loud knocking noise from underneath our room that the staff couldn't resolve, but without hesitation they moved us to a room on the 5th floor with a harbour view and balcony. The breakfast wasn't included, but was good and worth the £10 (I think - it was a weekend special deal) we paid each. Not so sure this is ideal for central London, but if visiting the O2 or Excel, this a great hotel to make your time extra special. ",5,2016,05,27
119,"Great Stay, disabled visitor","My partner and I visited this hotel with a Groupon Voucher. My partner easily managed to manouvre the hotel with his mobility scooter and was able to charge the battery in our room. The staff were helpful and friendly, the room was lovely and the food delicious.  The views from the restaurant were amazing, all the fabulous architecture of London, it looked like a futuristic pretend world to me, loved it!  I enjoyed the sunshine sitting on the balcony in our room watching the swimmers and the aeroplanes!
We were asked during the booking process if we would like to pay an extra £20 to have a riverside view, we declined this offer but got one anyway.
We amused ourselves trying to guess what other visitors were Groupons!  I think they were the ones who had gone a bit pale  deciding if they wanted to pay an extra £4.50 to have some spuds with their dinner! (we did, they were lovely)!
I really recommend a night at this hotel, we thoroughly enjoyed the experience.
Oh yes, check on your key card holder for the Wifi, its written there. We noticed it as we were leaving!",4,2016,05,27
119,This was a 60th birthday treat for my wife in April 2016,"I cannot fault our stay.  The staff were attentive.  They all wished my wife a happy birthday and made her feel special.  Excellent facilities, the room was spotless.  Our evening meal and breakfast were excellent.  I would definitely recommend this hotel and we hope to visit again soon.",5,2016,05,27
119,Luxury stay!,"Stayed in this beautiful yacht for 2 nights. It was in a lovely setting with a big grassy square to the front and the Excel next door but not too close, and the Emirates dock was a lovely walk to the nearby Emirates Air line cable car, which we went on 3 times!
The yacht was stunning both inside and out. Our cabin was spacious with lovely fittings and very comfortable beds and the carpets throughout were sumptuous. Our only criticism would be that the breakfast was very expensive considering it was self service.
We would certainly love to stay again! Thankyou Sunborn for the memories.",4,2016,05,27
119,Unique and Relaxing,"Beautiful cabin, clean, free wifi, coffee, fridge, overlooking the Thames River. Friendly staff, nice bar, overpriced drinks and food. Good housekeeping. Room service a bit slow
But adequate. Dinner menu limited but several good cafes and restaurants within a short walk. On the flight path to London City Airport so must tolerate jets landing every
5 minutes. No fitness center. Close to tube stations in East London but a £50.00 one hour taxi ride to central London. Recommended for special occasions but not extended stays in London.",4,2016,05,27
119,All Aboard,"We stayed for one night with our grow up family, being allocated 3 different rooms on 3 different floors.
We enjoyed dinner & cocktails and the amazing views of the river. 
Breakfast was also very good although we had to wait quite a long time for a table.
Both our daughters rooms were right next to the corridor entrance doors (On different floors) and they were disappointed with the loud banging all night from the doors shutting and the noise in the corridors from other guests. Both daughters and their partners didn't sleep very well.
The rooms are spacious and well equipped and we had everything we needed apart from a good nights sleep.
it was a nice hotel to visit but I'm not sure we would stay again",3,2016,05,27
119,Best Afternoon Tea in London!,"As a birthday celebration, my sister and I visited Sunborn London on Monday 23rd May.The Under the Sea Afternoon Tea was simply delicious..! The champagne made the whole experience even more special.  All staff were pleasant, welcoming and looked after us really well. Amazing views made this a brilliant experience not to be missed.
I would definitely be recommending this floating hotel to my friends and family.",5,2016,05,26
119,excellant,amazing place to stay  staff very friendly nothing was too much trouble. breakfast was superb. a lady on reception was called terane I think she was there with a gentleman called vadim. who was also very helpful. will most definetly go again,5,2016,05,26
119,Could be better,"We visited this lovely floating hotel as a treat with an offer from Groupon. That in a way says it all. This hotel is situated close to London city airport, the O2 and the Emirates cable car. It's really quite a good location with transport links into central London just a few short stations along.  
We enjoyed our time here very much. We couldn't gain access to our room till 3 and I would hazard a guess that no one would be permitted to enter their room even if it were ready as I suspect they use your eagerness to make money on their extortionate priced drinks in the rather sterile bar. £22 for two drinks included a service charge of 12.5%, discretionary of course but there nonetheless. 
The rooms themselves are excellent, large, clean and cabin like. The rest of this hotel is lovely but I do think they do not make enough of their unique selling point which is the fact that it is a ship! This is not exploited nearly enough. I saw only two porthole Windows, the uniforms for the staff did not make them appear to be from anywhere other than a hotel and all in all the hotel did not provide me with any illusion of being on a ship. I certainly would not class my experience as an experience. The staff were friendly, the food excellent but basically it felt slightly sterile. I would ask that the manager who reads this does not dwell on my good comments as these favourable comments should be a given in this four star hotel. What I wanted was the slightly extraordinary and I'm afraid it did not quite deliver. I also felt that more should have been done to help the passengers promote the venue, leaflets to take home, a guide to the concerts and other events close by would have all gone some way to assisting customers when thinking about return visits. Concierge service was not available as far as I could see, if it were it again should have been more visible. Groupon customers loved the bargain but I do feel return custom would come if more effort were put into trying to get return custom. Just a thought. 
After all that surprising negativity please do understand I would recommend this hotel to others and will endeavour to return and to be honest it is quite expensive so another voucher would help the likelihood of returning shortly.",4,2016,05,25
119,"Fantastic Hotel, Great Food & Excellent Staff ","I booked this hotel for our 20th Wedding Anniversary.  My wife an I arrived however I had booked the following night, this was not a problem Vadim/Zivile reallocated us a room moved our dinner reservation over looking the O2 and canary wharf. While playing down my embarrassment!! With no troubles at all as I was my mistake! The food was 1st class, one of the waiters recommended a cocktail bar in soho, which was also excellent.  The rooms are spacious and luxurious.  This is a well run hotel, where the staff take great pride to ensure they give you a stay to remember.  The slight movement on the river Thames added to the feel of being on a luxury yacht too.  Definitely recommend and we will come back here! 5*  ",5,2016,05,25
119,The Best Boat Going Nowhere,"We (two couples) booked this one-night stay on the beautiful Sunborn yacht via an offer, which though not cheap, was still a decent saving on the ""full"" price. Included was dinner, breakfast, and a bottle of Laurent Perrier champagne per couple.  

The yacht had been the venue for our 25th wedding celebrations not long ago, and it was that brilliant two-night stay that had prompted us to suggest to friends we go back to the yacht with this offer. 

On our first stay we were absolutely delighted by the first glimpse of Sunborn, nestled in a corner of Royal Victoria Dock, almost adjacent to the ExCel. Easy to get to via the DLR, its sleek and beautiful shape has the wow factor that tells you straight away that booking here is a good decision. The impression of modern, tasteful grandeur carries on once onboard, with polished wood, gleaming glass, brass and mirrors, all making a statement of modern elegance.  The same impression hit us when we arrived for this second stay, and much to our delight, our friends felt exactly the same way. 

The yacht interior itself is beautiful, but what makes Sunborn worth the visit is the incredible staff. Polite, professional, friendly and extremely smart throughout. From the reception staff, those looking after the bar, colleagues in the restaurant and the staff keeping our rooms immaculately clean and provisioned, we never on either occasion came across anyone that didn't have a smile on their face, or that didn't come across as nothing would be too much trouble. 

Although we arrived well before the check-in time, we were able to complete the necessary formalities and leave our cases with reception - thank you Robert. We were going to travel into the city for the afternoon anyway and so didn't need to get into our rooms until later. One tip - if you are intending to dine onboard phone ahead, or ask on arrival to make a reservation. We left it until returning to the yacht around 5.30pm and as a consequence only had a choice of 6pm or 9.30pm. We opted for the earlier slot and despite rushing around to shower and change quickly, it worked out ok. The only disappointment though was for the whole evening the restaurant was half empty, and we struggled to understand why our choice of time was so limited. Let's give them the benefit of the doubt and assume lots of people booked but failed to show?

Between first arriving on the yacht and returning later that afternoon we took advantage of the Emirates Airline cable car (£3.40) over the river to the O2, from where we picked up an MBNA clipper to Tower Hill (£6.50). What a great way to get back into the city, and back to the yacht later on. 

On this and our previous visit we were given Executive River View rooms, which are well worth asking, and if necessary paying an upgrade for.  Beautifully finished, with balconies overlooking the dock, these rooms are guaranteed to impress and to give maximum comfort. Spotlessly clean, with flat screen tv, fridge, tea & coffee, and a bed you can lose each other in. 

Waiting for us in the room was a beautifully handwritten note from the manager, wishing us a pleasant stay. Alongside were four beautiful chocolates, elegantly presented on a slate board. Both were very considerate touches and much appreciated. As too was the champagne, which because we we rushing into dinner, we asked if we could drink at the table. Not a problem; the bottles were collected from our rooms - thanks Agne - and chilled in the restaurant, where they were served to us through dinner. And very nice they were too. 

The meal itself was superb.  Starting with delicious warm bread rolls, followed by an Amuse Bouche of smoked salmon with goats cheese and lumpfish roe. The next three courses for all four of us were stunning. Our first courses were a delight. Three opting for Dorset Crab, and one for quails eggs. All four main courses were fish dishes, which were perfectly cooked and presented. Desserts were a delight, although I couldn't resist the cheeses which were spot on. The service in the restaurant was first rate - thanks Ben and colleagues - and certainly matched the wonderful food. This would give most top end city restaurants a run for their fine dining money!

Despite rushing to get to dinner, we still managed a pre-meal cocktail. We'd enjoyed cocktails on our previous stay and were determined to repeat the experience. The choice and execution is once again faultless. The bar area is very comfortable, and, as too the restaurant, has an outer deck area on which to enjoy the views as you sip or dine. We thoroughly recommend the cocktails, and ask at reception for a discount voucher for them. 

After dinner we enjoyed a few more drinks in the bar and then fell happily into our rooms, and our very comfortable beds. 

Breakfast is served in the restaurant, and is an absolute feast!  Fruit, cereals, breads, cold meats, cheeses, yogurts, smoked salmon, and all the makings of a full English are available. Who were we to refuse any of it?

Reluctantly though we had to check out, and after promising the very pleasant and helpful Vadim that we'd be back, we made the short walk back to the DLR. Another tip - we then went to the Sky Garden at 20 Fenchurch Street, for the most amazing views of London. You must pre-book, but it's free and incredibly worth a visit. As well as an amazing viewing gallery, up on the top floor is a large cafe, comfortable seating, a brasserie and a fine dining restaurant. 

Another great trip into a great city. Bring on the next one.

119,Wonderful Proposal,"My partner surprised me with a trip to London over the weekend. We had lunch at Tower Bridge and took from the Thames Clipper to The O2. From there we took the Cable Car over the Thames to Royal Victoria Dock and we walked along the water towards the hotel. 
Our hotel was a massive yacht which was so impressive. At the beginning I ddint know that we were staying on the yacht and we were making photos in front of it. When we saw the decks, where guests were sitting outside he asked me if we should have a drink there, before we were going to our hotel. While we were waiting for our drink he went to the reception and picked up the keys and went with me to our room. What an amazing surprise. The room was very big and we had a balcony. The hotel arranged swans (made out of towels) with rose petals, chocolates and a bottle of Champagne. There was also a handwritten welcome letter from the hotel management. 
We went for dinner to the restaurant and had my partner proposed to me, while we had a drink on the deck afterwards. It was like a dream. 
The next morning we had a massage and we went afterwards to breakfast. It was such a wonderful memorable stay and we have decided to stay there again in July, because we have already tickets for a show at The O2.",5,2016,05,25
119,A perfect treat,"Celebrated our 25th Wedding Anniversay chose the Romantic Package fantastic value for money. Very professional, attentive and considerate young staff, their whole purpose is to give each customer an experience to be remembered.  It began with a wonderful welcome from the receptionist Tamoe who was very interested in our celebration, then there was Ben who smiled all the way through Dinner regardless of the pressure of service, this was only topped by Isobel the server in the Sundown Bar in the evening she was welcoming, attentive, her ambition was to meet the needs of the customers no matter how demanding she is an absolute credit to the Sunborn and her profession.  Then there was Jay who created some wonderful cocktails in the bar and was a pleasure to watch.  Jay and Isobel made a great team supporting one another with always an air of professionalism.  Every member of staff from cleaners, serving staff etc where friendly and courteous.  
We highly recommend the Sunborn to any visitor to the Excel area of London, absolute luxury that caters for everyone.  We had a river view room however this wasn't necessary to enjoy the ships location as the best view was from the bar and restaurant deck with a superb view of the O2, cable car, Canary Wharf, you could even see the Shard and the Gerkin in the distance.  For us personally we loved the fact that the Sunborn is on the flight path for City Airport which is an incredible sight but not a noisy distraction because the flights stop before bedtime.  
A glamourous but down to earth taste of onboard luxury, deck shoes not required as the boat has a luxury onshore hotel feel.  Only recommendation would be to take a hairdryer as the only one onboard is a fixed dryer in the bathroom, so much nicer to dry your hair at the beautiful dressing table.  Our room was a Classic room the bed was huge and the furnishings were immaculate. 
The evening meal was wonderful and worth it for an amazing treat but other restaurants are in the area if you want something less extravagant however the bar meals where wonderful too and good value for London.
Even if we don't get the chance to stay again we would definately make the effort to at least go onboard for a meal and occasionally treat ourselves to a little luxury.
Check in is 3pm and check out is 12 noon.",5,2016,05,24
119,Excellent hotel,"Excellent hotel in a great location, we were very close to the Emirates cable cars which was great for getting over to the o2.  We were made very welcome by all of the staff, we stayed in a standard room but it was great, very spacious and nicely set out.  I would highly recommend this hotel.  We are hoping to return with our children later this year. 😀😀😀😀😀😀",5,2016,05,24
119,Amazing!,"I booked this as a gift to myself - to continue to honour my new year's resolution of increased self care.

From start to finish my experience was amazing. I felt so welcomed at check in, the staff there were so nice. I didn’t go for dinner as I already had plans somewhere else, but looking at their menu,  I should have given it a try - and I will next time.

I did have breakfast the next morning and they happily catered for my gluten free and wheat free special dietary requirements.  Nothing was too much trouble and I felt very well taken care of!

Thank you for an amazing service, an excellent stay. I'll be back!",5,2016,05,24
119,It's a Knock Out,"Second time we have stayed at this brilliant hotel. Excellent location for events at the O2 Arena, Will be staying again next month and is our hotel of choice. 
The staff (Gytis and team) are more than willing to help and are always extremely pleasant. Only downside is the level of food and drink choice on board. 
Overall would highly recommend the hotel.",5,2016,05,24
119,We had a splendid time.,I took my boyfriend for his birthday and this was our first time visiting the sunborn hotel. The staff at the reception was absolutely fantastic. They gave us information and history about the yacht.  We stayed out the first floor....with a beautiful view of the river and the Emirates carts in the distance. We both enjoyed out stay and we will be definitely be visiting the yacht hotel again..,5,2016,05,23
119,Anniversary Weekend,"Rating this hotel a 3 seems harsh but a 4 would be to good.

As a couple who enjoys trips away for special occasions in good hotels this did not live up to our expectations.  

The rooms were well appointed, the bathroom functional. Key card access was intermittent and three times I needed to get the keycard reprogrammed, but of course it was our fault that the card had lost its programming.

Personalisation was missing and the only point where any personalisation occurred was at our dinner in the 'Landsend' restaurant, where the Maitre d' confirmed that this was our anniversary. At all other times there was no personalisation in the conversation.

The dinner meal for my wife was tasteless and feedback was provided at the time.  

For an anniversary weekend away this was disappointing and the value for the experience of sitting in the Royal Docks far to high.  This is a one off for us at this location.

",3,2016,05,23
119,Marathon Stopover,"Booked two nights (before and after the London Marathon).  We had stayed on Sunborn before around 2006/7 I think and loved it.  But this visit was not so good.  The room we had was so hot and there was no air conditioning. The maintenance person tried to fix it but we melted in the night - not very good before the big race.  They moved us to another room the next night but that was under the reception area and it was so noise with people walking up and down all the time.  
It was such a disappointment as we had wanted it to be a luxury event.
We also ate in the restaurant for the second night - it wasn't that great and they didn't charge us for a large proportion - but that wasn't the point as it was a big event for me and I was disappointed with the whole experience.",3,2016,05,23
119,Unique hotel in Docklands,"Stayed at the Sunborn Yacht Hotel recently as part of a business function. It’s an interesting idea – a large luxury yacht turned into a floating hotel. It’s moored in the ‘Royal Victoria Dock’ just next to the ExCel centre in London. And a few minutes walk from the Emirates cable car, DLR etc. So the location is great.
Travelled down by car and parked in the Royal Victoria car park adjacent to the Crowne Plaza hotel, about 5 mins. walk away. Good value at £15 per night.
Check in was fairly painless and the first impression of the room was ‘wow’! A lovely large double with a nice shower room, Molton Brown toiletries, powerful shower and plenty of cupboard space. But a few downsides – a nice ‘pod’ coffee maker is in the room. But only two pods which is a bit mean. And no large cups if you want to make a cup of tea! Wi-Fi (as ever in hotels so it seems) was rubbish. Painfully slow and continually dropping out. Phone signal (‘EE’) was also erratic. So not so good from that perspective.
The bar area was good – the open deck with a view of the O2 was especially nice (although a bit noisy as you’re on the direct flight path out of London City Airport).
Can’t comment totally accurately on the restaurant as I was there as part of a corporate do. But the food we had at that was excellent so if that’s the general standard – thumbs up!
Breakfast was good also with a wide choice – the downside was that the room was packed and it was difficult to locate a table. 
One general irritation was the entry / exit to the hotel which was by relatively small lift. You can be queueing / waiting at busy times.
But, overall, it was a nice stay and I’d like to go back sometime – preferably when there isn’t a company function going on!",4,2016,05,23
119,Amazing Place to Stay,"Wow! this is the place to stay in London if you don't need to be right in the city centre. The yacht hotel is situated right next to Excel London, it is a very short walk to the nearest station on the Docklands Light Railway station, it is only a 15 minute journey to the Tower of London. We were greeted at reception and breezed through check in with the minimum of fuss, we were directed straight to our room, the hotel is spotlessly clean, our room / cabin was very large for a basic room with a massive double that was very comfy. The ensuite was immaculately cleaned with Molten Brown products.The bar area and restaurant look very nice but we did not use these as we used the restaurants in the city centre. I can't wait to stay here again.",5,2016,05,23
119,Hidden gem! ,"What an amazing place, a truly hidden gem!

We booked an Executive room with a riverview, the room was so spacious with a comfortable king size bed and a seating area. They have Molton Brown toiletries in the bathroom!

The reception staff are very friendly and attentive, we had a smooth check in.

We went for dinner in the restaurant after having a few drinks in the bar, the view from the bar deck is stunning, I had the duck and lobster terrine and the John Dory fish, and my husband had the grilled radicchio and the pancake cannelloni. Our meal was well cooked and very well presented.

The service in the restaurant was also very attentive.

Next morning we had breakfast, plenty of choice and well cooked.

Amazing experience, very much recommended, we will definitely come back!",5,2016,05,23
119,A different side of London,"We stayed a few weeks ago on the yacht Sunborn Yacht in Gibraltar and wanted to try also the yacht in London. It is not as big as the other one, but the service is as excellent as the one we experienced in Gibraltar. Spacious rooms with Molton Brown bathroom amenities. Powerful shower and you have a tablet with complimentary Wifi in your room. 
There are many restaurants and two supermarkets in walking distance and you can take the DLR to Canning Town. From Canning Town it takes you just 20 minutes to Central London with the Jubilee Line. It is not really close but, the 40 minutes trip back to the yacht is ok, if you can enjoy the special atmosphere on a yacht so close to London.",5,2016,05,23
119,When I found this place online I couldn’t believe that there is a floating hotel in London!,"A yacht in London? When I found this place online I couldn’t believe that there is a floating hotel in London!
We arrived with the DLR and we got the WOW factor when we saw it! The lift takes you to the 3rd level where reception is. The staff are friendly and very efficient. We got the keys to our room.
The room was spacious, with a balcony overlooking the river and had everything we needed, even a tablet next to your bed and Molton Brown toiletries.
The area is really nice with plenty of dining options. We took the cable car over to the O2 as we were attending a show. So convenient.
We came back and ordered pizza from the room service menu, it came fast and was well cooked.
My friends couldn’t believe me either when I was showing them the photos, we will definitely return.",5,2016,05,23
119,Lovely meal in Lands End Restaurant,I was part of a group of friends enjoying a meal out but it would be an equally nice venue for couples or a special occasion.  I had a lovely crab starter followed by some beautiful tasty salmon.  I don't usually get as far as dessert but I couldn't resist the chocolate mousse with champagne sorbet which was really delicious.  All the staff were friendly and attentive and there was a nice relaxed atmosphere.  Great views of the O2 and good transport links make it a nice place to stay if you want to be out of the busy city areas.  No traffic noise is always a bonus!,5,2016,05,23
119,Very pleased with our stay at Sunborn,"Really enjoyed my stay at Sunborn. Me and my partner stayed for just one night but would definitely return. The whole boat is very clean and staff are very friendly, the food was nice and our room was spacious with a nice river view. The planes are quite loud as it is close to the airport, this might bother some people but it didn't affect us. Overall I was very happy.",5,2016,05,23
119,Over the top and over priced ,"Stayed here for my wife's birthday, long queues on arrival for checking in only 2ppl checking in
Stayed in a king size room quite nice however their was a constant knocking as it was windy.
I found the stay pretentious and over the top. For the money their are far better places to stay in London 
I also requested a welcomed note to be placed on the TV screen nothing 
Drinks are astronomical and the Land end restaurant very expensive 
I would not be returning this yacht not for me. Over priced and not value for money.
The good this was security as you could not get to your cabin without your card.
Only saving grace ",2,2016,05,22
119,Nice,"Missed flight at LCY otherwise wouldn't stay here to be honest. Price wasn't bad. Didn't really use many amenities at the hotel. Isn't much in the local area either. 

The room is quite dated but still luxurious, surprisingly quiet and a decent sleep. Bathroom is quite small to be expected. 

All in all quite a forgettable trip - I certainly don't understand why anyone would book this as an ""experience"" unless they were an enthusiast. I don't think it's luxe but any stretch. IMO - your mileage may vary. 

No complaints however, staff were very friendly and helpful. Just seems like a gimmick. The views are very but atmosphere, wind and location is just undesirable.",3,2016,05,22
119,Luxury conference stay,"Enjoyed a splendid room with a balcony. Super comfy bed. Breakfast good, nice selection of the expected but also good fresh fruit and breads. Bar staff stayed the distance ☺ Used meeting rooms and banquet dining - all a good standard.",5,2016,05,22
119,Girls night out,"We booked to stay on the Sunborn for my Sister in laws 40th, we were all pleasantly  surprised at how accommodating and polite the staff were. We had a couple of drinks with bar snack in the bar area after arriving, which was a very relaxing atmosphere. We had already arranged our entertainment for the evening, so am unable to comment on the evening dinning experience but found the breakfast very fresh and well worth what we paid.. We all had a very goodnight sleep and we are all going to arrange a return visit and maybe book something at the O2 as the cable carts over the O2 are only a short walk from the Sunborn. I would advise to anyone it's well worth the experience.",5,2016,05,22
119,Fantastic experience,"Not like any other hotel I've stayed in! Staff were friendly and helpful!
My husband really enjoyed his birthday present!
Rooms were spacious and comfortable!
Ideal location for travel to London and the O2!
Will definitely be booking again, hopefully in July!",5,2016,05,21
119,Party on a yacht ,Stayed here last night and had a fabulous time. The rooms are comfortable and modern. The staff couldn't do enough for us and made the experience a memorable one. I can't praise it enough it's everything it promised and more. I will definitely be back. ,5,2016,05,21
119,"A special place to stay, without worrying about seasickness","The whole experience is special, the rooms are large and perfectly appointed, 5 star plus accommodation with an nautical outlook to savoir. Handy for the Excel Center and a short step from public transport that connects to the rest of 'The Greatest City in the World'. If you wish to eat and drink offboard there are numerous really good establishments within minutes.
Would always stay here if we can afford it.",5,2016,05,21
119,Top notch luxury,"Stayed here with my husband in an executive suite. The room was spacious, well equipped with fridge, hair dryer, molten brown wash products. The service from all staff was exceptional from reception to the bar and restaurant staff. Not the best if you want to be in the midst of London activity as quite far out on the DLR line but if you're looking for something a little different then this is a great option. Food was great especially breakfast which had everything you could possibly imagine. ",5,2016,05,21
119,Want somewhere unique to stay in London????????,"I was absolutely blown away by this amazing boat on the Thames in London....a fantastic moored hotel.....I stayed here last month and was so blessed by the hot sunny day for my experience.....I walked toward the impressive sight of the boat glinting away in the sun and knew instantly Inwas going to be amazed. Entering via a small lift up to the reception it felt like I was about to embark on a cruise. Simply beautiful. The staff are immacutely turned out and helpful from the outset. I was shown to my room...which was simply huge!!!!! With my porthole window looking out onto The Thames glinting away in the sun. After a quick unpack...I ventured up onto deck...to chill...ordering a cocktail and lunch...both mouthwatering. I whiled away the afternoon watching the planes fly over into London City airport. In the distance you can observe the pleasure of crossing the Thames on the Emirates Cable Cars offering superb views of London...a treat which I encountered the following morning. The Sunborn may be located a little out of central London but has easy access to the Underground to get into London and plenty of cafes, restaurants and bars around it to keep you fed and watered. I would most definitely stay here again....",5,2016,05,20
119,Pure Luxury,"A beautiful oasis close to the Wharf.  Excellent facilities, friendly staff, very comfortable rooms and easily accessible.
We used it as a base when we went to a west end show, came back and had cocktails in the bar whilst admiring the lovely views of Canary Wharf by night.",5,2016,05,20
119,something different,"Very good service ,the room was very spacious even a tablet at the side of the bed, coffee machine for coffee lovers a pity we weren't  there long enough to enjoy the room very comfortable  beds a great experience. The views overlooking London and the dome are wonderful. A little way out at Victoria docks but not a problem these days of instant travel, and the cable cars are nearby. Next door to the excel centre. One downside is the entrance to the  sunborn is by lift and if many people arrive it can be a nuisance. If you don't want to eat in the restaurant there are plenty of eating places nearby. The food is also very good I recommend  the restaurant for evening meals",5,2016,05,20
119,Pure Luxury - Have booked to go again,"Amazing, my husband bought me the stay on this amazing hotel as a Christmas present, loved every minute of our stay... The staff are brilliant , really cheerful and so helpful. We ate in the restaurant and the food was amazing, Great breakfast too, nothing to complain about and will go frack again very soon.",5,2016,05,19
119,Docked but they still care,"I dined twice last week at this exciting venue. It was fun to be in the world of a cruise ship without leaving the dock. All the amenities and niceties of a luxury ship at sea. Great happy faces and attitudes, eager to help and the food was amazing! 
Get the warm radicchio salad! 
The GM or should I say Captain came by our table and assured that we were happy customers. When I needed assistance on another matter he personally assured that it was handled. I'll be back. Wish this were near my home, I'd be there every week. Dine on the deck or indoors. Both are fun.",5,2016,05,19
119,Luxury,"It was our 32nd wedding anniversary and I was looking for something different to surprise my wife. We had booked to go to the grand design show at excel centre. Which gave me a good chance of surprising her. When we arrived at st Catherine's dock the sunborn does look very impressive and as we walked up to it and I said that's where we are staying she didn't believe me.
Anyway a few minutes later in our cabin looking over the Thames it was lovely and luxurious. We toured the yacht and could not believe how beautiful it was. We had drinks outside on the sun deck  and booked an evening meal.
The evening meal was not the best II sent my meal back as the potatoes weren't cooked vegetables cold as was the lamb.
They cooked another meal but potatoes still not cooked.
The staff were excellent the accommodation high standard would definitely stay again but dine else where

119,Lovely. Will return ,Went for a friend's birthday and stayed in the exec suite. Omg a must. We did pick the best weekend weather wise. Sunbathing on the deck was great. Food great. Drinks great. Afternoon tea great. Couldn't moan about anything. ,5,2016,05,18
119,Great Hotel,"The Sunborn is a great hotel, if have a room with a balcony or stand on the deck by the bar you can imagine you are on a cruise! The rooms are sumptuous, and very  comfortable, the bar area is good and attended service. It's in great location if you attending an event at the Excel or even at the the O2 as the Emirates cable car link is a short walk away. But be warned the cable car link shuts early, so getting back from the O2 late could be a taxi ride which will be around £20. ",5,2016,05,18
119,Birthday Trip Stay,"I booked this floating hotel as  part of a overnight stay with a theatre trip for my friends present.
It was a beautiful setting by the River Thames and the boat itself is stunning inside and out.
The room i had chosen was a Family Executive which had a balcony and it's such a spacious room and very 
Tastefully Decoratedwirh the most comfy beds slept on anywhere.",5,2016,05,18

Overall a great stay, will definitely stay there again next C2C 2017, looking forward to it.",4,2016,05,17
119,Lovely Experience,We visited this hotel for three nights and wished it was longer. Staff were very polite and friendly. Our room was huge when you consider some I've stayed in London. Room very clean and tidy and big bathroom with Molton Brown toiletries.  The bed was massive and very comfortable. Only half an hour from the centre of London and 5 minutes from London City Airport.  Loved it so much tried to stay longer but fully booked.  Would highly recommend this hotel and will definately return in the future.,5,2016,05,17
119,What a treat!,The hotel itself is wonderful. Our room was upgraded to a river view and my fiancé had arranged for chocolates and rose petals which was delightful. The staff were very attentive and the bed was comfortable and very clean. The bathroom had underfloor heating and the shower was very powerful. The only annoying thing was that the emerites cablecar stops at 2100 so tube only option if your visiting the o2.,5,2016,05,17
119,Unique hotel in London,"Not many yacht hotels in London that I am aware of , but we got this place for a decent rate and stayed on the lower deck without balcony. The room was very spacious with a lounge area and the toiletries/tea/coffee were all of a high standard.

We didnt eat or drink at the hotel so cannot comment on that , but at 19 pound a head for breakfast we thought we would give that one a swerve. There are a few restaurants nearby within walking distance and if you are at the ExCel for any reason the location cannot be beaten.

A unique venue with a wow factor and I would definitely stay there again.",5,2016,05,17
119,Luxury,"Stayed here in March, staff were all very professional and helpful. Making every individual feel important. Room was 'OK' expected more for what the hotel actually offers.
Very grand setting. breakfast was lovely, fresh food always being put out. staff in the restaurant were also very polite and helpful. always having a smile on their face.
will be returning in the near future.",5,2016,05,17
119,Cocktails on board,"Spent a wonderful Saturday afternoon on this beautiful Sunborn Yacht hotel sipping Cocktails  .
What an amazing place to be .Get the cable car over to the O2  so it's a great place to stay if seeing a concert .
Even better for a special celebration",5,2016,05,17
119,Amazing,This hotel is awesome!! Staff unbelievably friendly and soo helpful!! Made u feel so at home and even hotel manager spent time with us!! Breakfast included was worth it too!! Dinner was very good too!!!,5,2016,05,16
119,Amazing !!,"Wow what a wonderful experience. We visited for a suprise present for my partners 40th ( not that we told anybody that). A super yacht so clean and gleaming. We checked in without and problems. We had a meal in the restaurant which was beautiful our waiter Brian was very attentive very polite. Our room was sparkling clean and very comfortable. The staff were wonderful and couldn't be more courteous and polite. Breakfast was buffet style and included everything you could want and gain was very nice. On check out Vadim was very helpful and very polite. 
Great location. Great hotel. Amazing time and win definitely be returning.",5,2016,05,16
119,Slow!,"My husband and I spend the night here hoping to have a romantic night in London. Upon arrival we were notified that the room we reserved was a dockside view which was not clear when we reserved the room. Then they informed us there was no availability for dinner between 630-10, again not clear when we reserved the room and three course meal that we needed to call to make a reservation to eat at a normal hour. The waiting time for check in was very long, equally the same long wait at the bar. We ended up having to upgrade our room to get a water view and paid an arm and leg for it. Ended up going offsite for dinner since they couldn't accommodate us. 
The room was very nice, lots of room in the junior suite, and comfortable bed. It's too bad the other parts of the stay were so poor. Should have know when I saw them on groupon that something was off here. Good luck management in getting your service up to speed and updating your webpage. ",3,2016,05,15
119,Afternoon Tea,"Excellent afternoon tea, superb staff, very attentive,  particularly with regard to my egg allergy.  Fantastic view over the Emirates cable cars and the city of London from the restaurant and the lower deck bar.",5,2016,05,15
119,Birthday celebration with friends,The setting was fabulous with the London skyline as a dramatic backdrop. The dining room was spacious with plenty of room for the plates champagne flutes pots of tea and coffee pots. Finger sandwiches were tasty as were the small cakes and scones. We had orange jam and strawberry jam and clotted cream. Service was superb. Every one who served us was charming and attentive. We had some further drinks in the bar downstairs and once again the service was fabulous. Highly recommend the place for people looking for a relaxed event,5,2016,05,15
119,Great location,Very nice Hotel and location. Food not so good evening meal was average and service during breakfast was very slow. We had to ask 5 times for our Tea and Coffee. Room was clean and bigger than average for London. Great location for exploring.,4,2016,05,15
119,Yatch a suprise,"I purchased a one night stay with dinner main course only with a glass of wine  and breakfast in an executive room from Group-on for my husbands 65th birthday.
We traveled by undergroup and DLR which was quite easy to get there.
On arrival we went to reception and booked into our room which overlooked a small paved and tree lined frontage.  Plus other buildings including Excel. The Room was clean and tidy we had tea and coffee and complimentary water in our fridge. We went out for a couple of hour and visited the 02 arena via Emirates cable car which was well worth a visit, stunning views with aeroplanes coming to land at City Airport very close by.
Dining our main meal was included in our deal with a glass of wine I choose one of the most expense items on the menu to find out we had to pay a £5 supplement and another £4.50 for a tiny bowl of roast potatoes. If I hadn't  of got our meal in the deal I don't think we would have eaten in the restaurant at those prices which were very expensive.
Good nights sleep very comfy bed, very hot shower, and great breakfast.",5,2016,05,14
119,slow service for our afternoon tea,"We visited for afternoon tea, there we're six in our party and it was for a special birthday  occasion-the restaurant wasn't at all packed but the service was so slow, we had to send  the bowls of fries back as they we're nearly cold and waited 20 mins or so for coffee and had to ask again it finally arrived 10 mins later also the sandwiches were a bit dry on the top slices needless to say we will not be rushing back anytime soon",3,2016,05,14
119,Hotel good but private dining food not good,"Quite expensive private dining for a party. Food late and not good. Long, long delays between courses. Very disappointing as hotel is good and staff are nice. Definitely lets it down as this a unique venue.",3,2016,05,14
119,Unusual idea,"My boyfriend and I have just returned from a one night stay on the yacht after he booked it for my birthday treat. Upon arrival I was instantly impressed! It is such a unique idea for a hotel - I have been on several cruises and the decor on board the yacht was very similar. 

The staff were all so friendly and our room was lovely. We went for a couple of drinks at the bar which was in a lovely location with great views of London. 

We ate dinner at a restaurant nearby so didn't get a chance to eat at the hotel restaurant but the menu looked nice. It looked a bit expensive but I'm sure if the food is good it would be worth it. 

Bed was very comfortable. We ate breakfast on board which was a lovely selection of pastries, breads and full English. Again, all with an amazing view.

I will definitely be recommending to friends who are looked for somewhere to stay in London.",5,2016,05,14
119,Nice concept but disappointing,Stayed on the yacht for one night when visiting Excel. Arrived at 2pm to be told rooms weren't ready and to come back at 3. Went on to the terrace to have a bite to eat and a drink. Had to ask 3 times just for the menu! It ended up taking an hour and a half for 2 club sandwiches and 2 drinks each and cost nearl £50 and they added 12.5% service charge for the appalling service. Rooms are nice and the addition of the terrace is very good. Had dinner on board and the menu is quite good but the actual food disappointing and bland. 2 X 2 course meals and a bottle of wine was well over £100. Breakfast had a good selection but it was all cold or luke warm. All in all very disappointing and expensive,3,2016,05,12
119,Yachting for Landlubbers,"Every year for our wedding anniversary we try to pick unusual places to stay. This year it was the Sunborn Yacht hotel moored very close to Excel Centre. We reached it by the DLR Custom Quay stop or you could use the Emirates cable car from The O2 arena which would be a great way to arrive. From both locations it's a very short walk to the hotel which is obviously located by the dock. Dockside view is quite pleasant as it is adjacent to a small square with plenty of greenery and benches and a view of Excel. Riverside views are mainly of opposite blocks of flats, cranes and other industrial machinery and of course distant views of the London skyline, O2 arena, Emirates cable car, and naturally, the river.

Reception is on 3rd floor via a lift. One's first impression is of bling and glitz, plenty of shiny brass, glass and polished wood with an overall impression of vague Art Deco style. Reception staff are really friendly and helpful, and yes they are not English but we understood them fine. The bar is located on this floor with an outside terrace as well for sunny days, or smokers I suppose. Guests are given a 25% off voucher to use once in the bar. Drinks and especially cocktail prices are a wee bit pricey but of course it's London so almost expected. I chose a Dark and Stormy cocktail having drunk rather a lot of these in my past. It arrived as a Light and Sunny and after trying to persuade myself it was ok I swapped it for a glass of white wine. Very disappointing. Bar snacks were not at all badly priced although we didn't try any.

We had an executive room overlooking the river. Very large room with comfy bed, sofa, drinks area, small frig, tea and coffee making facilities. Wardrobe with robes and slippers and ironing board and iron. (Doesn't work on wrinkly bodies, shame). Free wifi, so a big thumbs up for that, I'm fed up with paying exorbitant prices in UK hotels. Bathroom was a good size with really cosy underfloor heating and  a large walk in shower. The balcony is small, just about room to move and have 2 chairs. However the edge is blocked in with metal so when you sit down the view  largely disappears which is a shame. We are both tall but mostly got a view of the very tops of buildings and the sky, where was the river?  When we returned to our room at night we found the curtains would not pull together as someone had left curtain rings in the way. Maybe Madonna likes to reveal bits of her body to the public but we had no desire to copy her. We sort of propped them together and told reception next morning and hey presto sorted when we returned later. Carpets could do with a bit of spot cleaning where previous guests have dropped tea and coffee.

We had a disastrous meal in the restaurant on the 4th floor which was a shame. The views are pleasant and the room nicely laid out. If you dine midweek before 7pm make sure to ask for the set menu which is good value. We found the a la carte prices high and expectations were not met. If you set the bar high you need to deliver quality in all respects. Because of this we opted out of our planned breakfast aboard and had a great English breakfast at Bonanne further along the quay. There are plenty of other places to eat and drink only a short stroll away and a Tesco Express and cash machine.

I wouldn't say this was my favourite of all the unusual places we have stayed in, no wow factor for me, but it's fine and it was great to explore an area of London which we are unfamiliar with.",4,2016,05,12
119,If you fancy something different....,"From the moment we checked in to when we left, staff were very approachable and helpful! We were really lucky with the weather so to sit out on deck drinking sundowners was bliss! We only stayed one night as we were there for the basketball finals. Breakfast was absolutely fine and served with a smile. Just 2 minor things, one of the lifts wasn't working which was a bit annoying and the toilet in my friends room keep flushing by itself. She managed to get breakfast off the bill which was a nice gesture! Rooms spacious and we had a river view, beautiful in the morning....",5,2016,05,12
119,Excel-lent,"Thoroughly enjoyed the short stay.
Courteous and friendly staff. Fantastic views all around. Taxi driver couldn't get to the front door but it's good easy access everywhere, even to the Excel. 
The room was perfect with a very comfortable bed.
My only niggle is that the balcony has solid metal front with two patio chairs on but if you were to sit on the chair you'd be staring at the backside of the metal ship.
Perhaps these should be swapped for a pair of bar stools so you can look over the handrail. ",5,2016,05,12
119,Everything was great,"I spent a couple of nights on the Sunburn and everything was great. It was easy to find, check in was quick and easy, my room was great with an awesome view over the harbour.

In the bar behind Reception, Jay and Alex, were always attentive, even after the bar had closed.

Breakfast in the morning was extensive.",5,2016,05,12
119,Glad we've done it,Lovely big and comfortable room but bathrooms were not in keeping.  Small rooms with plain white tiles were not attractive.   Great location and very quiet despite being in London.  Breakfast choices ok but a bit limited.  Service ok but reception staff all had very heavy accents and were very hard to understand. Just speaking English is not good enough.  It needs to be understandable.  The yacht decor was mostly good with exception of bathrooms.,4,2016,05,11
119,Not a pleasant experience,"If only one issue happened I would let it slide however from the moment we arrived I did not enjoy this experience. Reception did not acknowledge us for 15 mins, serving other customers whilst we wait. Eventually another member took us to the spa. We were told that we receive a massage/facial with the scrub but then were asked to pay for it - explained we only wanted scrub so they didn't charge us but by this point we felt bad. My scrub was didnt include the exfoliating scrub or a chance for it to sink in before I was asked to wash it off and oil applied. I've done these before and this is not how it should be done. To top it off - I have emailed to complain and not even received an acknowledgement!",2,2016,05,11
119,Stunning setting but a few faults ,"The Sunborn London has the potential to be amazing . It's stunning to look at and the views from your room (if your river view) are excellent views over the river and you can see the O2 arena and the cable carts going through the sky . The reception and bar area is nice and the decor in the rooms is pleasant . Our experience wasn't as good as it should've been for a few reasons which I will explain now . On arrival we were told our room would not be ready for half an hour . We had tickets to watch the UFC at the O2 so were on a tight schedule. Our room should have been ready as we didn't arrive until an hour after the check in time . After half an hour we went to reception and she told us it would be another half an hour . I don't think this is good enough . We went back to the bar for another drink when all we wanted to do was get into our room get unpacked and get ready to go out ! The reception were not apologetic and didn't deal with us the way we would expect to be dealt with . Finally got to the room and we had to rush out so we couldn't take in the fantastic view from our balcony . There was a red stain on the carpet which looked like a thick blood stain ,about 3 inches in circumference, this was right in the middle of the room so we covered it up with a pair of shoes so we couldn't see it . When we got back from the O2 arena we were a bit peckish so we ordered room service which was not good at all , poor quality food at a very expensive price . We weren't that bothered about that though as we were ready for bed by time it arrived . The bed was comfy and we had a good nights sleep . The next morning we had breakfast and it was one of the best breakfasts we've ever had in a hotel , absolutely delicious ! everything fresh and hot , wide selection of hot and cold food and good selection of drinks . If we hadn't been kept waiting for our room for so long and there wasn't a blood stain in our room this hotel would have got a five star rating but I had to choose a three star based on the two big negatives . Shame because without the delay to the room and the bloodstain we would have had a perfect stay in a stunning setting . I would like to give it another go sometime and hopefully be able to give it a five star review . ",3,2016,05,11
119,MOSA ,"Stayed at the sunborn hotel in March as I wanted to stay somewhere special for my wife's 40th birthday with our 2 children.
On booking the surprise stay the receptionist who took my details said as it is my wife's 40th birthday they will do something special for us so I even upgraded to a executive family room but on arrival we were met by a couple of staff on the reception desk chatting away to each other and we were made to feel as though we were an inconvenience and we were interrupting there conversation but as it was my wife's birthday I didn't make a song and dance about it so I carried on with checking in then went to the room where I thought this should be good I wonder what they have done special in the room for her but when she opened the door they had done nothing not a thing which really spoilt it for me because I hadn't asked them to but they had got my hopes up by saying they were going to do something special which was unfair if they had no intension of doing so I had even had confirmation of my booking which said it was my wife's 40th so I rang just to confirm the details they had sent and again they said they had made a note and would do something.
I was going to order breakfast at £80 but after the lack of surprise and the attitude of the receptionists I couldn't wait to leave and go on to our next destination which I must say was far better for half the price. Hotel is ok but won't be returning as it didn't meet my expectations.Sorry if you have booked just make sure if they promise you anything don't get your hopes up as you will be disappointed.
Hope you enjoy more than we did

119,Birthday surprise ,"Having stayed many times and making us both very welcome.
We have always enjoyed the luxury on ever occasion .
This time being a birthday celebration  the manager Apostolos surprised us with a lovely gesture ,balloons as well.
All the staff are lovely and helpful cannot wait until next stay

Thank you all Andrew & Teresa x",5,2016,05,09
119,Attending a show at the O2,"Stayed at this hotel as part of my big (50th) birthday celebration as we were attending the comedy gala at the o2. Vadim checked us in & out the next day & there is nothing negative i could say. From start to finish everything was perfect including the weather. Friendly helpful staff, gorgeous room, comfy bed, sunny balcony, lovely view. Thanks for everything, am already planning our next trip & bringing friends.",5,2016,05,09
119,Fantastic place to stay,"Wow, I can only say good things about this hotel. It's very impressive especially the very grand reception area.
Our room had a view over the river which was great and it was very spacious. The hotel was very clean and tidy. The products in the ensuite were Molton Brown. Very nice. We had two complementary bottles of water in the fridge and a Lavazza coffee machine.
The hotel is in the docklands of London which has fantastic transport links into the city. A five minute walk to the DLR station and even closer was the cable car across the river. We had visitor Oyster cards which we used on both.
There isn't a carpark for the hotel but there is a multi storey carpark a short walk away and it charges £15 for a 24hr period. There are a few restaurants close by and a couple of  convenience stores. The Excel exhibition centre is next door. 
The bar on board was lovely and if it's nice there are tables out on the deck. It is expensive to drink onboard but it's London!
The staff were all polite and helpful and check in and out was simple and fast. Also great that you can get free wifi for up to 4 devices during your stay.",5,2016,05,08
119,Sunborn Liner London,My friend treated me to lunch in London on the Sunborn Linerfor my Birthday. Fantastic meal and fabulous surroundings. The decor is a very high standard. The  Manager and staff are absolutely lovely and made us feel very special.I definitely would recommend the Sunborn to my family abd friends.,5,2016,05,08
119,The top of the hotels!,"Second visit to Sunborn London and it exceeded our expectations again. Smooth check in, very friendly reception staff, we met the duty manager Apos who was great, we stayed in an executive Riverview room, huge and comfy bed. We had dinner in the restaurant,  again staff were very attentive. Amazing experience overall. Thank you for everything. We will be back soon .",5,2016,05,07
119,We will return to Sunborn again for sure!!!,"Apart from the excellent scenery and view,  we received adequate, integrated but most of all proffessional service from all the members of the staff (reception, bar, restaurant). The rooms were more than clean and elegant! Additionally,  Sunborn was really close to many interesting places ( O2 arena, where we watched a show, ExCel) and of course central London! We are definitely coming back again!",5,2016,05,07
119,great hotel,"We had a groupon voucher for this hotel; which was excellent value given our 2 children went free. The room was excellent everything you could need and a very very comfy bed. Breakfast was fantastic, and our evening meal in the restaurant was delicious. You are quite a way out from central london, but easy journey on the DLR. Not much in the surrounding area, but this didnt matter for us, as we only used the hotel as a base.",4,2016,05,07
119,Outstanding service!,"My boyfriend took me to London for a couple of days to celebrate my birthday. We arrived at the Sunborn to check in and had a small issue getting the room key to work in the elevator. We waited at the reception desk where we were greeted by Andreas, the General Manager of the Sunborn, who took us to our room himself. Upon arrival he said he would try and find us a different room with a balcony as we were inconvenienced with the room key. We said how lovely that would be as it was my birthday after all. Five minutes later he returned and took us and our luggage to an executive room on the 5th floor with a beautiful balcony overlooking the Thames. The room was spacious, the bathroom was beautifully clean with Molton Brown toiletries, there were white fluffy robes and slippers available in the wardrobe, a decent TV and also tea and coffee making facilities. 
Later we went out for drinks and dinner and on returning several hours later Andreas had left a beautiful hand written letter in our room thanking us for staying at the Sunborn, along with four delicious macaroons. Such a wonderful touch, and I certainly felt special! 
The bed was extremely comfortable and we slept soundly all night. Check out was swift and easy and the staff on board were all very polite and helpful.
All in all a brilliant experience which certainly makes us want to stay on the Sunborn again.",5,2016,05,07
119,Mr Jiten Vadher ,"Lovely night very nice and clean place nice staff food i feel i was in Titanic i came here with friend son for his 25th birthday celebration for one night it was great he likes too i give 1000 stars to hotel and the staff ;)) hope to see you soon  
If you are on holiday you must visit this Yatch awesome place this place will make your day ",5,2016,05,07
119,Second visit and still lovely,"The positives
It feels like true luxury 
The bed and pillows are amazing
Great shower
Coffee machine 
Stylish and essence
Lovely staff

Negatives:
The view out the window if you can't afford to pay a £70 upgrade
The fact it's £40 for two people for breakfast..
Like I'm really not sure what sort of food you're serving for breakfast but I would kind of want lobster and caviar for that price...

",5,2016,05,06
119,O.M.G....... AMAZING!!!  Absolute perfection.  Best place I have ever been to.,"Where do I start!!  From arrival, walking into the yacht, the experience is just incredible.  Staff are beyond helpful, polite, yet treating you completely as an individual.  We arrived early, expecting to just ask for our luggage to be stored, but the room was ready, which was a bonus.  Everywhere was impeccable.  Clean, polished, attention to detail is perfection.  The room was fantastic.  Spacious, clean, robes, slippers, coffee machine, etc.  Beautiful.  The food was amazing.  We had breakfast both days and everything you could want was available.  We had an evening meal one day, which was the best food I have ever had!!!  Everything you could hope for and more.  You really dont feel you are in London.  Brian, one of the restaurant staff, was such a lovely chap.  Really attentive and just spot on.  Vadim, one of the reception staff was also just the best.  Honestly couldnt recommend this enough.  We will definitely be returning!!!  THANK YOU for the best 40th birthday ever!!!!",5,2016,05,06
119,Attention to detail required,"Booked 2 nights for our 49th wedding anniversary and was somewhat disappointed by the lack of Wow factor.  The outside of the vessel is very low key and when we arrived, only one lift was working - a situation that we see all too often.  The Reception staff were very friendly although we had to go back as one of the keys failed to work.

The Executive rooms are quite big and have a sofa, a small fridge and basic tea & coffee making facilities. The outside balcony just takes 2 chairs although sitting down you probably only see the tops of the houses on the opposite bank as the side of the boat blocks the view.  Since the riverside balconies face south, you will get some sun in the afternoon.

The shower is a very decent size and has a washing line for small items.  The bathroom is heated so washed items should dry overnight. 

We had to get them to remove surplus runners on the curtain rail as the curtains would only close leaving a six inch gap which meant the room was fully light at about 5am.  To their credit, this was fixed the next day.

The beds are large and comfortable although I found the duvet too thick and hot.  The tea and coffee stains on the carpet attest to a certain carelessness by guests.",4,2016,05,06
119,A real treat!,"Stayed for my husbands 50th with 15 and 12 year old daughters (I checked it was ok as booking said family room was for 12 and under).  We had an executive family room on the 3rd floor with river views - it was so exciting!  We got there by using the Emirates Skyline so saw the yacht from high up, what a grand arrival.  Entering the lobby you are met by a grand staircase and huge chandelier adding to the feeling of luxury.  Reception, bar and dining room staff we encountered were all very professional, polite and courteous.  The room was lovely, lots of mirrors, my husband loved the tablet on his bedside table, my daughters loved the Molton Brown toiletries  - I loved the balcony and views to the O2 and beyond.  We ate in the bar to suit all our tastes enjoying the views and had breakfast in the restaurant - lots to choose from.  We've already told several people about the hotel which is so unusual and they have already booked to stay!",5,2016,05,06
119,Best hotel by far,"Stayed on a Tuesday night with my husband. Arrived early but they had a room ready for us. The receptionist was very friendly and professonal, she made us feel very welcome. We stayed in a room with a balcony over looking the water. Very impressed with the size and spec, everything just as their web site said.  Huge comfy bed, loads of space, all the extras you would expect from a 5star hotel. Had both air con and central heating. The view from the balcony was next to none. Great nights sleep with no noise, could have been that overall they didn't seem busy. Had breakfast in our room which was the best I have had, still warm when it arrived :), lovely lady that delivered it, the staff are just the tops. Love the tablet in the room, ordered out breakfast with it, quirky but very handy. Will most defiantly be back this year and would recommend a visit without a doubt.",5,2016,05,05
119,1 May  3night stay,"Just returned home from a great bank holiday stay on the Sunborn Yaht. It's positioned just outside of London but with the tube service a few minutes walk away, this really did'nt stop us feeling secluded and making the most of all the sights of this amazing city.

Breakfast is fantastic £12.50 the list of choices where endless. Fresh salmon, full english breakfast, choice of cereals and lots of fresh fruit, drinks and pastries. 

We stayed as a family and my children aged 8 and 3 just loved it. Something different than the usual ""hotel stay"". 

The reception staff where friendly and the maids done a great job. The room was cleaned daily. The coffee making faciliries where great!.

Dont let the distance from central London put you off and make sure you have a contactless debit card for the London underground, rather than a £12 daily oyster card, contactless allows you to scan and travel anywhere on the underground for £6.50 pwr day.

Perfect holiday and i would love to return.",5,2016,05,04
119,Wonderful stay in a fantastic hotel ,"My wife, 10 year old daughter and I stayed at the Sunborn, London for 2 nights from the 30th April til the 2nd May and had a fantastic stay. 
The boat is beautiful and to a very high standard. We had a family room which was spacious and looked great. 
We also had a river view which with the help of the great weather added another nice touch. 
The staff were friendly and helpful. 
We had breakfast included with our reservation and the food, like the rest of the hotel, was excellent. Great choice of fruit, cereals, pastries and cooked food as well. 
The location of the hotel is also great, a short distance from London City airport and only a few yards from the Excel arena. A short tube ride away, or cable car ride, is the o2 arena. 
An added bonus was the X Factor auditions taking place on Sunday right outside the front of the boat where my daughter got to see Dermot O'Leary!
The Dockside area around the boat is also very nice with some resteraunts and a very handy Tesco Express. 
We didn't buy any drinks or food on the boat so unable to comment on price etc. 
Overall a fantastic stay which we intend to do again next year. ",5,2016,05,04
119,Amazing stay! awesome hotel!,"Everyone should at least stay on this boat at least once! I had a groupon for 2 massages, dinner with wine and a room overnight.
The ladies in the spa were excellent and the food was so tasty, can't recommend this stay enough.

Only down side was them taking £40 off of my card before we stayed, surely your card should just be pre approved. Also a local car park would be handy as no where to park that is reasonable. 

I would stay here again in a heartbeat, the surroundings were just beautiful and staff were so lovely, cant wait to come back!",5,2016,05,04
119,Amazing hotel!! ,"Me and my boyfriend stayed here from the 1st may - 2 may over bank holiday weekend!

We arrived about 2 and checked in did the paper work but our room wasn't ready till check in time at 3 so we sat in the bar and then we went to sit outside on the deck! we got given drink vouchers from reception so our drinks were okay in price however I can see that usually they are very expensive. we loved sitting out on deck watching the world go by - this weekend the xfactor auditions started which we never knew about so it was great to sit outside and watch all the hopefuls wait their turn :)we then checked in at 3, speedy service our bags were in our room before we was :), we was amazed by the size of our room! it was like a living room massive! the coffee machine was a great touch and the bed was super comfy!! we watched tele for a while before heading out to the 02 center in which we went by Emirates cable car we loved it! and cheap with a Oyster card too! then on the way back we got the dlr back which was very quick and convenient for us! we had a amazing sleep and we had breakfast delievered to the room wow!! the choice was mental and the presentation and food quality was amazing! nothing was to much trouble!!  we loved loved loved our stay everything about this amazing hotel made our weekend! the price was amazing to considering it was a bank holiday weekend! we cannot wait to return and already looking into booking again soon!
everyone should 10000% try this hotel as its a unique lovely hotel?! :) xxxx",5,2016,05,04
119,Wonderful stay onboard this floating hotel,"Stayed for a 50th celebration , perfect venue, delicious food and drink. Service was first class by the staff. Breakfast also very nice. There were 12 in the party that all felt it was a wonderful experience. Lovely molton brown  toiletries to use, shower was excellent and room spacious with  a great view on the river side. 
A unique stay, we shall return. We used the Emerites cable car (5 min walk from yacht) to cross the river to then travel on the river taxi up to central London , it was a perfect connection and saved using train/tube. Great to see the sights, roughly about 40 mins onboard.
I would recommend staying onboard the Sunborn for any occasion, I shall return!",5,2016,05,03
119,Lovely Stay aboard the Sunborn,"My partner and I stayed here for one night this bank holiday weekend and was really impressed with it. Check-in was quick and easy and the rooms were spacious. The whole yacht is really well kept and spotlessly clean. 

We had sunny weather so sat ondeck for drinks then moved inside for our food as it got a little windy around 5pm. We both had burgers that were cooked wonderfully. We both really enjoyed our meal but thought the drinks were a little on the steep side. 

The downside to the bar was there was no entertainment whatsoever so on a Saturday night, it was a little dull. Even some background music or piano player (something light hearted could be what this needs). We got a little bored and went back to the room around 10.30. You could always go across to the 02 but we wanted to enjoy our time on board and this would defeat the object of staying at the Sunborn.

We didn't manage to get into the spa as you have to pre-book, they get booked up quickly. 

Would go back again.",4,2016,05,03
119,Excellent Hotel and location,"Had a lovely stay at the sunborn, Great location for the O2 and lovely spacious rooms with fantasticViews of canary Wharf and the o2, staff were really friendly and helpful. will definately return here. 2 night just wasnt long enough",5,2016,05,03
119,"Amazing stay, will defiantly be going back","My husband and I came and stayed with friends (another married couple) for our wedding anniversary. 
From the moment we walked onto the yacht we were impressed with the level of customer service received from the Reception staff, we were dealt with by Vadim who was very polite, professional and had an excellent level of customer service. We upgraded our rooms so that we had a balcony and with that we were well looked after.  
We really enjoyed our stay, the bar staff were also very nice.... We were never left with an empty glass for long :0)
Nothing was to much to ask of them.

The rooms were really lovely and comfortable, anything you needed you had. The view from the balcony was beautiful and so nice to wake up to on a lovely sunny morning to look out on.

Anyway to cut a long story short, we can not wait to book again and come back maybe in the summer.
Just would like to say a massive thank you to Vadim, because if I'm honest I think the main reason we are coming back is because of him.
See you soon
Mr & Mrs Baker/ Mr & Mrs Collis",5,2016,05,03
119,Excellent if attending the Excel or O2,"Check in was quick and easy with pleasant, friendly and helpful staff.  We were offered an upgrade to an executive room including breakfast for an extra £50 for 2 nights but we declined as we weren't planning on spending a lot of time in the room to warrant the cost of a balcony. 

The room was a lovely size with a river view as booked.  It had a settee, table, tea and coffee making facilities, safe, iron and board, wardrobe and the all important bed.  Unfortunately the bed was not the most comfortable I have ever slept in and we woke up every morning with a bad back.  The bathroom was a good size with a double walk-in shower and plenty of hot water. Although the temperature is a little bit fiddly to get right.  The rooms would benefit from carpet to dull some of the noise from upstairs.

I had to call reception twice the first time because I could not open the safe to put my valuables in and they arrived very prompt, the second time to get my valuables out. This time I had to call reception again after 20 minutes before anyone arrived.  

Check out was quick and easy. 

Service in the bar was very slow and like cruise ships they add 15% service charge even if you go to the bar yourself.  I cannot comment on food as we did not eat here.

It is quite a way out of the centre of London and took us 60 minutes to get back to Paddington.  Mind you I think you are better getting off the DLR at Canning Town and getting the train to Bank rather than going to Tower Hill.

Would I stay here again? Possibly if I was attending the O2 or Excel

Would I recommend this to a friend? Yes if they were attending the O2 or Excel.",4,2016,05,02
119,Very nice hotel. but with some reservations.,"We stayed at the Sunborn from 25th to 28th April. This visit was a present from family for my wife's birthday. Cost of visit about £400 for 3 nights. Good value for London although a long way from the center.
It's fair to say at the outset that we did quite a lot of reading up on the Sunborn through Trip Advisor, so had a good idea in advance of what to do and expect. With that in mind we upgraded to a room with river view on the same floor as reception. The room was excellent. Everything worked as it should (apart from the safe The battery was flat but was changed by the maintenance man within 10 minutes) and was spotlessly clean throughout our visit. The balcony though small, was big enough for 2 chairs and ideal for our sundowners with a view over to the O2. The hotel is on the flight path for London City Airport which is very busy. Planes come in low! Earliest flight about 7-30am latest flight about 9-15. With doors closed hardly heard the planes. We live on the flight path to Manchester so are quite used to noise.The bed was one of the most comfortable we have slept in compared to lots of other hotels.
Our first evenings meals were a bit of a disaster. Part of my wife's meal was stone cold and the duck I ordered was tepid and like rubber. The head waiter quickly rectified the situation with fresh meals (and a reduction on the bill). However the saving grace were the scallops, superbly cooked to perfection and hot. After the meal we went to the bar downstairs to find it deserted. Already knowing the prices of drinks on board this didn't surprise us. 
Breakfasts on each of the days of our visit were very good with excellent service and more than enough and variety of food to choose from. But, and its a very big but, get the plates hot so the food doesn't get cold before you have finished eating it, and buy some toasters that don't take half your breakfast time waiting. We didn't eat on board the second night, however on the third night both our meals were excellent though we had a small issue with the bill. This was quickly resolved by the restaurant manager.
Conclusions.                  
For: The Sunborn really is a very good and different place to stay.
        Close to Excel exhibition center.
        Close to the Docklands Light Railway and tube links to central London.
        Close to the Etihad cable car (recommended) for O2 and river taxis.
        Close to several restaurants and a local pub.
        The service from start to finish was excellent

Against: Getting there by car. 
              We stayed with friends in Kenley who drove us to the hotel. Took us 2 hours.   We returned to Kenley by train in 52mins!
              Cars cannot approach the ship so you have to carry your luggage about 150 meters. 
              The food in the restaurant could be better. There is no excuse and nothing worse than serving cold food which should be served piping hot.
               Cold plates for hot food.
               Toasters. Re hot food cold plates.
               Might bother people who don't like living on a flight path.
               Cost of onboard drinks is prohibitive.Take your own
Note to the management. It's the simple things that make the difference from being just ordinary.",4,2016,05,02
119,What a fantastic place,"My wife and I visited here with friends this weekend, what an astounding hotel, complete wow factor. Really nice spacious rooms, lovely afternoon tea in a really chilled atmosphere and a comprehensive breakfast menu. The staff are all excellent and nothing is too much trouble, we would definitely love to come back one day. Very much recommended .",5,2016,05,02
119,A stay to remember!,"We stayed for one night with a river view and would certainly return. The yacht is incredibly pristine from the rooms to the restaurant. The rooms are spacious and authentic, the bar staff were very helpful and polite, the breakfast was perfect, location was great. A wonderfully romantic break! ",4,2016,05,02
119,A beautiful gem in the big city ,"Where to start? This hotel is stunning. It's hard to find such a peaceful and tranquil spot in London but here it is!
On arrival we checked in early and the staff were very helpful, our room wasn't quite ready but they took our belongings to the room whilst we had a drink at the bar. 
It was our anniversary, we found as we entered the room that we had been upgraded and there was prosecco on ice and chocolate truffles - delicious and free of charge!
The room itself was spacious and well maintained with a huge bed and lots of pillows. 
A niggle and the only negative of this experience was that the room was hot and the a/c didn't appear to work too well. However, it wasn't unbearable.
Service from the staff is great, they are all consistently friendly and helpful.
We received a message to our room from the hotel congratulating us on our anniversary which was a nice touch. 
The Views from the bar, restaurant and room are excellent. From the bar you can see canary wharf and the emirates airline. 
Breakfast was excellent, plenty to choose from to include continental and cooked. The pastries were warm, I particularly enjoyed the smoked salmon with Philadelphia cheese. Cooked breakfast items were all good quality and not greasy. 
Drinks in the bar were averagely priced for London. 
Easily accessible to the o2 and North Greenwich line via the emirates airline. 
We will definitely be returning to this hotel in future. An elegant and romantic setting. ",5,2016,05,01
119,Great experience,Visited with a coach party and was not disapointed. Lovely large cabin on deck 1 looking over the Thames. Breakfast was buffet with limited choice but well cooked. Drinks were expensive with only small bottles of beer and wine was £8 per glass. Staff were very pleasant.,4,2016,05,01
119,Stunning,"The boat is fixed and does not move or rock.We were early but they checked us in and let us leave our cases so we only had to pick up the keys later. They take £40 from your card in case you spend any money onboard, but refund it if you don't. We bought 2x gin and tonics and got £17 refunded back to card so drinks are expensive.The room was large with a river view and King size bed and a tablet for internet. Fridge with 2x bottles of complimentary water, real coffee machine and kettle for tea. Blackout curtains and the room was so quiet not hearing other people except in hallway. Staff cant be more helpful especially on reception There are a lot of restaurants nearby and the Emirates cable car was great to ride across to the Millennium Dome to eat, There is a Tesco metro and a Nisa nearby to stock up on your alcohol. Check out at noon .So good we didn't want to leave.",5,2016,04,30
119,I slept on a Yacht on the Thames in London !,"Sunborn Yacht Hotel

Wow & Awesome- is the words that come to mind on initial viewing. 

Instead of a boring old standard hotel room you get to board a yacht and check into a large cabin with great views. 

The staff were very accommodating and helpful. They even opened up the barrier for us to drive direct to the yacht and unload. even when we checked out I went a fetched the car but the concierge/Porter had loaded everything onto a trolley and came out with a brolley for the guests as it was hammering it down with rain all the way to the barrier. 

late check in not a problem - late check out not a problem. 
cant fault it - Thanks karlos & the team.",4,2016,04,29
119,Wow factor,"Unfortunately I wasn't staying in this hotel myself but I met up with my 2 friends who were- Lucky people. Only about 8 minutes away from London City Airport and within walking distance of the O2  this refurbished cruise ship offers a glamorous setting for your trip to London. We enjoyed lunch in the bar - great range of delicious burgers amongst other things- lovely ,friendly staff.",4,2016,04,28
119,superb hotel,"fantastic hotel, great value. Miriyam on the front desk was super friendly as are all the staff.  the river view rooms with balcony are superb. you can order drinks from tablet to your room and they are fast.

Restaurant is excellent but i do not understand why it was quiet, better marketing maybe required because its excellent. If you are staying in docklands, not worth looking anywhere else",5,2016,04,28
119,Something Special,"We spent a few nights to celebrate our anniversary and it was special.  The Executive Rooms were lovely and spacious, bed huge and layout very user friendly.  It was nice to have a balcony, unfortunately weather too cold to sit outside.

We had dinner one evening and this was a bit pricey but worth every penny.  Service excellent and the portion size of the food very good.  Breakfast is a feast with a good variety of choice if you are a vegetarian.
Locality may not suit everyone as it is not in central London but perfect for the O2 and Excel Centre.  Plenty of restaurants around the area and transport is quick and easy.

If you arrive early and room not ready, there is a luggage store which is ideal if you wish to go off an explore.

As it is billed as a luxury yacht, just a very few small points need checking in the bathrooms which let themselves down, cracked tiles and stains on carpet in main lounge.  Lovely Molton Brown toiletries.

Definitely would recommend a visit and cannot wait to return.",5,2016,04,28
119,"You need to try this place out, you just can't go wrong!","Service is excellent, rooms are clean and i like the staff they're laid back.Meaning they won't let anything ruin your stay which i appreciate. Not picky in terms trying to scam you for money and charging you a late check out fee if you're a couple of mins late. The classic family rooms are huge, easily for four adults and there's parking all night for £15.00. It's not the cheapest of places but it's really worth the experience..i mean how often are you going to be sleeping on a yacht in London! perfect for couples and families, i'm definitely returning.",5,2016,04,27
119,A great experience,"We decided on the Sunborn for a few days stay in London and we were seeing ELO  at the O2.  We arrived early with the intention of leaving our bags prior to checking in,  the receptionist said that our room was ready so we were checked in early.  A £40 per night pre authorisation was taken against my credit card but that was no problem as it did clearly state that when we booked.  We went to our room which was an executive room on the dock side of the ship.  We were pleasantly surprised at the size and standard of the room, topped off with a huge comfortable bed.  We went out to get an idea of what was around.  Within a few minutes walk there are several different restaurants.  We chose to cross over to the O2 on the cable car where there are dozens of different restaurants for a lunch.  

In the evening we dined on the ship in he Land End Restaurant.  It was a very good meal good portions and excellent quality.  If here a any negatives the wine at around £30 a bottle is a bit steep but in a London location it's about what most charge.  
We stayed for two nights with breakfast on both mornings which was an excellent buffet selection.

Would we stay here again?  With out hesitation good value for money in a good location with central London easily acessable",5,2016,04,27
119,2 night stay,"Loved this hotel - we were going to the O2, took the cable car over and the tube and DLR back. The room was large with a seating area and everything was spotless. Very quiet at night with a lovely huge bed. Would definitely stay again.",4,2016,04,27
119,A wonderfully different hotel,"We stayed here for the 2nd time in October 15 - apologies for the delayed review. We loved Sunborn, The staff were wonderful, the room was spacious and well appointed. We loved the novelty of staying on a yacht. Would recommend this as an alternative to a traditional hotel.",5,2016,04,27
119,Beautiful,"Solo visit last year in October during Comic Con. I opted for Sunborn as I knew the other hotels around ExCeL would be loud with the guests. I explained to staff that I had problems sleeping over the months and would manage only 3 hours a day. I stayed in the Executive room with the river view and it was absolutely beautiful. Watching the sunset was perfect if you're into photography. The room itself was huge and made you feel right at home. As I was alone the bed was massive and I couldn't fault it at all. It was the best sleep I had that Year and my sleeping patterns have resumed to normal since. Your team members were excellent and consistently friendly throughout my stay, I was approached a few time in the lobby to ask how my stay was and that made the visit even more welcoming. Thank you for making my visit great. ",5,2016,04,26
119,A nice weekend away!,"Myself and partner spent a weekend away in London at the Sunborn Yatch hotel. 
The service when we arrived was helpful, however, we were told there would be an additional £80 charge (just incase we used room service or tray collection) - it would have been nice to know before or just adding the charge at the end if we did use it, as we now have to wait 5 days for this money to return to our account.
However, we were upgraded to a Junior suite - which we think may have been due to a loud wedding party on the same floor - although, this was still appreciated!
The room was really nice and spacious and the King sized bed was a highlight. The balcony and chairs would have been well appreciated had the weather been better - but we are still in Britain after all. Our one complaint with the room was that when we turned the TV on in the living area, it also turned the TV in the bedroom, which did become quite frustrating. 
We also found the aeroplanes departing and arriving at London City Airport very loud during sleep times - which is not advised when booking. 
The breakfast was buffet style and had plenty of options for guests to choose from. Whilst we did enjoy breakfast, I have to admit, some of it could have been a lot hotter and the mushrooms, which were described as ""herb grilled mushrooms"" appeared to only be seasoned with a high amount of salt.
On our second day the staff welcoming us at breakfast told us it was not included and would be charged to our room, which was incorrect, but she was quick to call hotel reception and rectify this mistake.
All the staff were friendly and wished us a good day each time we departed.
Check out was quick, easy and friendly. The £80 was refunded into our account without having to ask, however, it could be an inconvenience to some people having to wait the 5 days for it to be returned.
The boat is described as being in central London, and while it was only 1 relatively short train ride from the Tower Bridge train station, it is definitely not 'central London'.",4,2016,04,26
119,NOTHING SPECIAL,"Its not a bad hotel at all, but there is absolutely nothing special about it, the bar is such a waste, great unused potential. Its almost like someone who new what they were doing has started the job and then left. Very disappointed, Very expensive !!",3,2016,04,26
119,very good but could be improved,"Stayed on Saturday 23RD of April as attending ELO concert at the o2 great location very convenient. Room was spacious for London standards but a had seen better days lots of wood and mirrors and an externally dirty porthole window. Overall a decent experience but not exceptional.
Dinner food was very good and reasonably priced,nice restaurant with great views towards the city. Service was not brilliant considering we dined at 5.30 and the restaurant was quite, lacked the the personal attention and customer care experience one would expect in such an establishment.
Very comfortable bed and quite, secure and safe. Very welcoming receptionist who was pleased to help check in and out very smooth.",4,2016,04,26
119,Beautiful,"Amazing concept.  Gorgeous rooms with top end toiletries to boot.  Bed was exceptionally comfortable and there is no movement felt.  We were on floor 2 in room 2044.  It was an amazing room.  The only downside was that the floors are wood and so occupants of room above can be heard when they have shoes on in the room.  The same is true of us in our room with shoes, carpet in the rooms would have been good.  Check in experience could have been better.  With the hotel being a yacht I expected something special but we could have been checking into a travelodge as the receptionist behaved like she was doing us a favour.  Quite annoying when you pay a lot of money to stay and get treated as an inconvenience.  It was only one girl on reception that behaved like this to be fair the others were lovely and friendly.  Just unfortunate we got this one.  She asked if we planned to dine on board but slipped in that they were probably fully booked so we didn't bother and went to the Indian restaurant across from the yacht to eat.

Overall a lovely stay in luxurious surroundings. We would definitely recommend Sunborn Yacht Hotel",5,2016,04,25
119,Something different.,"Stayed at the Ibis next door previously and saw this and was surprised it was affordable.   We booked an Executive room with views of the water.   Really big, luxurious room, comfy bed and spotless.  You can only stand on the balcony, but it was good for some fresh air and it's on the flight path to city airport so you can see the planes coming in overhead.  We stayed to see ELO at the 02, if you do this for any other event, book online the Skyline and get a return ticket for £9, note it shuts at 11pm.  Breakfast at the weekend is £12.50 each, alternatively walk round the corner for a fiver.  A bottle of beer and a vodka was £14.50 at the bar, alternatively walk round the corner to the Nisa shop and buy what you like for your fridge.  It's not about being tight, it's about extortionate prices that are unwarranted.   Over all a nice hotel boat (it does not rock), very classy if you fancy a treat and it's right next door to the Excel Centre.  Nice staff also and you can even get married on it.",5,2016,04,25
119,Wow - highly recommended,"We have just visited this yacht . Omg it is stunning from the rooms, restaurant , location. Staff were very welcoming and understanding for my gluten free diet. We got the clipper thames taxi to greenach , then followed by emirates cable car which had amazing views. Great all round birthday treat 😃",5,2016,04,25
119,a fantastic birthday surprise,"my wife booked us in here for my 60th ,I was bowled over.having spent many years at sea working and now cruising ,this ship was beautiful.from the Atrium through to the rooms/cabins it was immaculate, brass and wood work gleamed .
 Staff attentive,we ate in the restaurant in the evening and watched London light up .walked to the cable car and got a night flight round trip to see the sights from a different angle.well worth it.all in all a great find and a happy Sailor.
.Last but not least we had a drinks with our meal ,when my wife checked the bill in depth after we had left she thought we might gave been overcharged.But with the whole week being taken up with more birthday surprises it was forgotten about.she informs me somebody spotted it and she has been reimbursed to her bank account.Now thats what we call service and can not speak more highly of the staff.",5,2016,04,25
119,Sunborn Yacht Hotel,Absolutely fabulous from start to finish.Try to get the upper decks over looking water.Lovely size balcony.A short walk for London transport.Restaurants&emirates' to o2 approx 10 min walk.Room has that clean crisp cabin feel.Staff have fantastic customer services.Great breakfast& restaurant overlooking water.very romantic..,5,2016,04,25
119,Amazing stay in the centre of London!,"What a fantastic 2 day mini break in London and so convenient with the cable cars to the 02! 
From the word go nothing was too much trouble. The foyer was a spectacular introduction to the hotel, the welcome was genuine and very helpful. 
The only surprise was that the key only gave access to our room, the lounge and dining room. I suspect that later in the year with the better weather, you would be able to sit out on the deck, but it was too wet whilst we stayed.
The room was clean and spacious and enjoyed a lovely view over the dock. We also had the benefit of Molton Brown toiletries, sumptuous fluffy towels and a Lavazza coffee machine, which was a lovely touch.
We did not get an opportunity to sample the dinner menu, but the breakfast was amazing and bountiful with all tastes catered for. I would definitely love to visit again.",5,2016,04,25
119,Amazing!!!!!,Me and my partner stayed for a night and it's the best hotel we have stayed it it's lovely the service is great it's very clean it's worth a visit we will definitely be going back in the summer make sure you ask for a balcony view to over looking the water A class place 👌🏽,5,2016,04,25
119,Great experience but more suited to older couples rather than young,"Great experience, 
Wouldn't return as I believe this is more suited for 40+ who seem to comment on what a wonderful time they've had.

I would suggest to the staff not to assume that every young couple comes to the sunborn via a voucher or discount deal. As people like us paid full price yet seem to of been pushed aside to accommodate the 40+ 
For example when we went to eat dinner we were seated for 15 minutes before anyone came to us to take our drinks order/food, and within them 15mins an older couple came and we're seated next to us they were served there DRINKS,STARTER'S AND FINISHED THEIR MAIN COURSE before we even got our main which in my eyes is not great customer service especially when the bill came well over £100.00... so how else does this look apart from favortism.
So with that experience I will not come again or recommend it to people of my age
",3,2016,04,25
119,Novelty,Went on a Groupon deal which was a massage with afternoon tea. The massage was ok but the spa very small for a yacht and a bit lifeless. The afternoon tea was nice and actually very generous portion sizes. The yacht has never been sea worthy and was built as a hotel so a bit of a gag really. The bar area was comfortable but absolutely freezing cold. We moved around the room 3 times trying to find a warmer spot. I did ask for the heating to be adjusted but this was not adhered too. A reasonably experience but would not rush to return.,3,2016,04,25
119,Great location,"We chose this as it is a really convenient location for the O2 - just a short ride on the Emirates Airline. It's also a short walk from the DLR and next door to Excel.

The reception staff were friendly and check in was quick. One of the lifts was out of action so that slowed us down in getting round. The room was great - a very comfortable bed and a spacious room. My main criticism is that everything is a bit clinical and corporate - it doesn't really have any personality. Oh and everything is ""fixed"" (hairdryer etc) which makes me feel like I'm not trusted.

The bar is fun - with a nice view over the river and good cocktails but the service was very slow. We didn't eat here as we were out in the evening and there was only a buffet breakfast available.

We stayed here on a promotional rate which made it good value & we'll use it again at the same rate. But I'd be extremely reluctant to pay full prices.",4,2016,04,25
119,Fabulous yacht hotel,"A lovely hotel to stay in,  very smart, very friendly staff and the a la carte food is amazing.
The rooms are fabulous, immaculate, could not pick fault with any thing at all.
Stayed for my birthday and cant wait to stay again.",5,2016,04,24
119,Lovely one night stay,"We stayed here mid week and we had a lovely time. Rooms were large and clean and it felt that you were actually on a cruise yacht and might slip anchor any moment.
The only bad mark I can give was the breakfast. The scrambled eggs were tasteless and rubbery. It was a buffet style breakfast but was not worth the £19.50 each we were charged. Shame really....",4,2016,04,24
119,Overpriced,"Booked this for an overnight stay as we were going to a concert at the O2 and this was pretty close. Reception staff were helpful and welcoming if a little difficult to understand, the room we had was a lower floor and so there was no view apart from the wharf wall. Whilst the room was spotlessly clean, the shower head had a crack in it and therefore you couldn't move the shower head without a jet of water shooting over the top of the cubicle onto the floor and sink unit. A hairdryer was provided in the bathroom with a plaque advising to press the red button to activate. I could see no such button and glad to call my husband in to look. After some puzzled looks he found it on the side of the bracket that housed the hairdryer but not in the outside but on the side of the mirror. I'm rather small so had no chance of seeing this. The bathroom was rather small but functional although you could not leave the door open as it automatically closed which was rather annoying as there was no fan and it got hot and steamed up the mirror. Tea and coffee facilities were provided with cups the size of thimbles, I like a proper sized cup for my tea. Bed was large and comfortable. Air conditioning unit didn't work very well.  Stopped in the bar for a drink after the concert and ordered a bottle of prosecco.the waitress brought it over, opened it and we asked to pay in cash. The bill was £5 more than the price in the menu and when my husband queried it the waitress more or less flung a receipt at him muttering something about service charge. We have stayed in many hotels, some of which have been significantly cheaper and gad better facilities and service.all in all it was very disappointing and appears to be extremely over rated. Will not be going back.",2,2016,04,24
119,A luxury get-away in the heart of London,"This yacht isn't very well-known so a hidden gem - although at the size it is, it's a wonder it's hidden!
Easy to get to and a superb location for getting around - more about that later.
The yacht is spotless - clean, shiny, excellent customer service, beautiful rooms, bar and dining area.
The views are amazing - both day and night.
We stayed one night but could easily have stayed more and used it as a base for day-tripping!
The location is fab - right near Excel if you want to go there, but for us, we walked 5 mins the Emirates Cable Car to go for dinner in the O2. Bowling and cinema in there too, but we just had dinner and did the Nissan experience which is fun for all ages!
We also got on the clipper from the O2 and went all the way down the river to London Bridge - fab way to see the city, without the trains and tubes! 
Definitely recommend for a top weekend.
Great when we got there but booking was a struggle - all resolved once I spoke to a manager but had to wrangle the rate as it's 'flexible' - which in my experience translated to: 'we'll make it up as we go along and pluck it out of thin air each day'.
Excellent place to go once the improve the email bookings though! ",5,2016,04,24
119,Fabulous One Night Stay,"We had a wonderful one night visit to the Sunborn London on the 14th of April, from the moment we arrived the staff were very welcoming and made us feel at ease. Our room was more than comfortable with everything we could ever need. We enjoyed the breakfast which was complimentary with our upgrade, which had something for everyone and set you up for the day. Special mention to Gytis who could not have been more wiling to in make our stay enjoyable.

P.S: Make sure you do the cable car which is walking distance away.",5,2016,04,23
119,Amazing Experience,"I booked this trip as a surprise for my husbands 40th birthday. First impressions it's an Amazing yacht. Our room was not ready upon arrival but we was more than happy to sit on the deck with a glass of wine, after an hour it was still not ready you do not mind waiting but having to queue at reception every time to be told it's still not ready became a bit annoying however the offer of a complimentary glass of wine made up for this. We eventually got to our room which was lovely and very clean, the hand written note and truffles was very welcoming however the bottle of champagne I ordered upon arrival was not in our room, I rang reception to be rudely told that it can only be brought after your arrival as the ice will melt?, we had been waiting to get in our room for over an hour surely this was enough time given for it to be put in the room before our arrival?
The lands end restaurant is lovely and Peter the Head Waiter could not do enough for you, however the first night they forgot about our main meals and had us sat for over an hour until we asked where they were, Peter jumped on this immediately when mine came it tasted amazing but was cold!! We was offered a complementary bottle of wine. Unfortunately the restaurant got many complaints but not due to the food or service as they simply can't do enough for you but due to a private party directly above, very noisy and spoilt the ambiance for diners. Due to all of the above we was asked to return the following evening so they could restore our faith in the excellent service they say they always strive for, and they did! the meal, service and ambiance on the second night was fantastic, eating dinner looking over the Docklands to the 02 is amazing. 
It will not stop us returning, we had a fantastic stay, and it's in a perfect part of London to enable you to sight see during the day but relax in the evening. The Managers and Staff do everything to rectify your problems immediately, I just wish the problems didn't occur initially.",4,2016,04,23
119,Very helpful and attentive crews & fantastic service!,Booked this hotel for my husband's birthday and our wedding anniversary.  The lady name Marilyn at the reception is very helpful when our booking failed.  Helped sort things out for us.. Second time around.. Carolina from the restaurant (Land End Restaurant) is very attentive to us... Fantastic service!,4,2016,04,22
119,Excellent,"My wife and I stayed on a Saturday night recently as part of a weekend break to London. We were greeted by pleasant, helpful reception staff upon arrival. The room we were given was clean and comfortable with plenty of amenities. 
The dock location is good it makes it a pleasant place for a Sunday morning stroll.
The nearby car park was a safe and secure place to leave the car as we used the nearby DLR Station (5 minute walk) to get into London. Breakfast was well presented with tasty selection to choose from. Overall the visit was a very pleasant experience",5,2016,04,22
119,Luxury at a low budget,"If you're going to Excel or the London O2 and fancy something a bit more interesting than the usual dull Ibis/Premier Inn room this is for you. Staff are v friendly. Yacht is a little dated with the red wood, mirrors and gold bling but a fun place to stay. Rooms generously sized, clean, decent shower and bed large and v comfy. Went to the bar and it was very expensive, but then you are in London! Only shame was there were a couple of middleaged rowdy drunken groups in the bar area who were a bit annoying - f'ing and blinding etc. so glad we hadn't expected a quiet romantic time. Think they do special deals on Groupon and maybe they weren't the usual set. Would still recommend though.",4,2016,04,22
119,Great experience,I recently went to the Sunborn London and had food on the yacht which was brilliant! Presented very nicely and tasted great too. I would definitely recommend and would love to stay in this hotel in the future. The staff are very friendly and accommodating.,5,2016,04,21
119,Fabulous hotel pure luxury,"We had a memorable stay for one night after a concert at the O2.  The hotel is beautiful, rooms very comfortable but what made our stay really special were the staff who were attentive and engaging.

We were lucky enough to have an exec room on the upper deck where we had a wonderful view of Victoria Dock and enjoyed watching the planes landing at London City Airport.

The view across the Dock to the city at night from the back of the ship was breathtaking. This view was revisited at breakfast when we sat in the window watching the commuters and tourists making their way around Docklands.

Novelty hotel, comfortable beds, good food and friendly attentive service - what more could you want from a hotel.  I heartily recommend you stay and see for yourself.",5,2016,04,21
119,Outstanding!,"Attended a business meeting in one of their meeting rooms. Standard of the rooms are amazing, and lunch here was excellent, amazing service the staff looked after us the whole way and outstanding food, what a venue!",5,2016,04,21
119,Excellent Accomodation,"We stayed here for 2 nights and was very impressed with the accommodation. The rooms very comfortable, clean and spacious, All the staff was very friendly and helpful and a great location to discover a different side of London. I would definitely stay here again and have already recommended it to family and friends.",5,2016,04,21
119,Beautiful purpose built hotel,This yacht has been built to be a beautiful hotel. It's stunning inside and out. All of the staff we met were foreign and very efficient and friendly. Our room was unexpectedly large being as it was on a yacht! Everywhere is spotlessly clean. The dining room is stunning. The only complaint at all was that the food was quite bland. Nothing had been seasoned properly prior to cooking. A real shame as the menu is good and all of the food was excellent quality.,5,2016,04,20
119,Stunning!!,"My daughter and I had the pleasure of staying here last year, we had the basic room but it was superb we where very comfortable and had lots of space! The staff where very helpful and lovely, we saw people on the river performing a water sport, maybe filming? it was nice and usual to spend the night on a yaught.",5,2016,04,20
119,Excellent,"Stayed here for 2 nights. All staff where polite, friendly and couldn't do enough for you. Rooms where cleaned and tidied for both days to a high standard. We stayed in executive suite which was glorious with balcony and free coffee/tea/water. Robes and slippers also provided. Food was excellent. Overall not a bad word to say. Would definitely stay here again. A very enjoyable 2 day/night stay.",5,2016,04,20
119,Amazing all round - particualrly the bar and bar staff ;-),"There were about 15 of us staying for the weekend for an expo happening in the Excel centre. The bosses had been generous enough to fork out a bit for us all to stay nice and close to the cente, and have some fun. Everything about our stay was excellent, checking in involed filling out a single form and that was that. Room was immaculate, bed was about 8 foot wide!!! lovely! Balcony was pleasant offereing as good a view as you'll get in that part of town. Special thanks must go to Alesandro, Teodore, Lulian and Jey (not sure if I spelled their names correctly) all of whom were exceptionally welcoming and facilitating. Anything we needed they were all happy to help the entire time and I would like to thank them all for this. Breakfast buffett in the morning was also top notch. I would definitely stay again, 100%. A lovely experience all round and a great bar worth visiting just for the cocktails. Thank you Sunborn!",5,2016,04,20
119,Restaurant,I had a great meal on the Sunborn Yacht next to Excel Exhibition.  A waiter Borja served me and was more then helpful and very pleasant.  I can recommend the Devonish crab to start with and the cod as a main course.  The interior felt like I was on board a cruise liner and the views of the Thames overlooking the O2 and cable-car rides was spectacular.,5,2016,04,19
119,Luxury stay on board the sunborn ,"Had a delightful overnight stay in the sunborn yacht hotel. Staff were friendly and helpful at every turn, the room was impeccably clean and the bed was very comfortable. Little touches of luxury like Molton Brown toiletries and dressing gowns made the stay very romantic and the river view from our little balcony was just lovely. We got a great deal so we can't complain about value for money but the only thing I would say is that the full £210 per night cost is very steep for a hotel 45min outside the city centre. Having said that it's a stone's throw to three DLR stations which will get you where you need to go and the industrial gentrified banks of the Thames are so nice to walk around. We didn't get a chance to use the spa or bar or restaurant so can't comment on those but what we saw of the hotel other than our room was beautiful. There's a tablet in the room which is really useful and on checkout the desk staff kindly printed out our boarding passes for the flight home which was nice. If we got a good deal we would definitely stay again. Thanks for a great weekend Sunborn staff! ",5,2016,04,19
119,Fantastic for a special occasion,"A massive thank you to all the staff on the Sunborn for making our stay wonderful and my wife's birthday so memorable. Sunborn have recently started doing a 'celebrity of the week stay' which we were fortunate to be a part of. We are certainly no POSH & BECKS but we were made to feel very special. We got upgraded to the Executive room where on arrival we had a fantastic array of canapés and drink to tuck into. The Sunborn is a must, nothing is to much trouble for the wonderful staff. Hopefully you'll be as lucky as my wife and I when you book....",5,2016,04,18
119,"Unique hotel, great location","The Sunborn is located on the doorstep of the Excel Centre, a 2 or 3 minute walk from the DLR Royal Victoria station and 2 minutes walk from the cable car over to the O2.   There are plenty of resturants within less than 1 minute walk however the food at the hotel is outstanding (if a little expensive).
We stayed in a balcony room with a river view, it was very comfortable, spotlessly clean, airy and well appointed.  We had bathrobes, slippers, Molton Brown toiletries, tea/coffee and complimentary water. 

The hotel is more or less at the end of the runway of City Airport so there is aircraft noise but flights stop bang on 10pm so there is no noise to disturb sleep.
All staff were very helpful, the reception area is beautifully decorated and the breakfast was one of the best I have ever had.  Highly recommend",5,2016,04,18
119,A business trip made extra special!,"We chose this hotel for the close proximity of Excel where we were exhibiting over two days.  Everything was excellent from the staff to the food and the room, which had the most comfortable bed we have ever slept in outside of home!

We did not have breakfast but dined both evenings in the restaurant and the food was exceptional.  The service was also excellent and it was a pleasure to meet Carina  from our ""holiday and second home"" in Portugal, who is an excellent ambassador for the company.

We will certainly visit again and hopefully soon!",5,2016,04,18
119,Nothing too much trouble,I had never thought of staying here but I have to say it was amazing. The staff were so attentive and professional. The facilities are first class and certainly memorable for being so different. Will definitely stay there again,5,2016,04,18
119,Convenience and pleasure of the Sunborn,"I stayed at the Sunborn while attending a conference at Excel.  The location is perfect, a two minute walk to the entrance of Excel!  The rooms were very comfortable, with balcony and king size bed.  Staff were friendly and helpful with all requirements, even keeping the kitchen open late one night when many delegates returned from an evening session at Excel.  Particular thanks to Julian at the bar for looking after everyone and particularly for making sure we had all we ordered from the kitchen, even after it had closed.
Thanks",4,2016,04,18
119,"Fantastic, not to be missed","Looking for a room with a difference?  This is one you should not miss.  Beautiful rooms, amazing staff, nothing too much trouble.  Bar food very good (highly recommend the cheese board to share).  A real touch of luxury at an amazing price.",5,2016,04,17
119,With improved check in/out would have been excellent,"I had the luxury of one nights stay here and I can honestly say it is lovely and was totally an unexpected find, so close to London's centre. The rooms were immaculate and the views were great too - both night and day. I was alone so had no issue with a smallish bathroom but it's more than adequate. 
My room viewed across the dock which was nice and the breakfast room view was even nicer looking across to O2, Emirates Cable car, Canary Wharf and London City. £19.5 is acceptable for a breakfast with this view. Recommend. ",4,2016,04,17
119,Very different hotel,"My partner booked this as a treat for my 40th birthday and upgraded us to a room which had river views.

The hotel is very nice and well maintained. We were able to drop our luggage off when we arrived as we couldn't check in until 3pm. 

When we arrived back later in the afternoon our luggage was already in our room. The room itself was huge with a large bed and sofa area. The room has tea and coffee making facilities including a fancy coffee making machine, it also has iron, ironing board, hairdryer, fridge, safe and toiletries in the bathroom. We were surprised how quiet the hotel is we didn't hear any noise at all from our cabin.

We didn't eat in the hotel we explored at night and found an Italian. The area of the Excel was very quiet at night it isn't a hugely populated area it is still up and coming so if you are expecting a lively night out the area doesn't offer that unless you venture further afield.

We had drink on board the yacht but be prepared to pay a service charge which we were not warned about which makes having a drink expensive.

The hotel is well located for the Emirates airline over to the O2 which is worth doing as you get great views of the area and beyond and we pre books our tickets to avoid the queues. Once your at the O2 you can jump on the jubilee line to get into the city and the O2 area has more to do at night.

Tips 
request cabin with river view
Be aware of service charges
Explore beyond the area for more nigthlife",4,2016,04,17
119,Never Fails to Impress,"We have just had our 3rd visit to the Sunborn London and we just cant get enough time there.  We just love this place and the people.  We had two great nights in this fantastic luxury accommodation.  We upgraded when we got there and had breakfast included for a change, which was ok and didnt really do the whole experience justice especially for the price it was supposed to be worth.  In the future i think just a room and the company of the Sunborn team.  

Still a top notch hotel and still love it :)",5,2016,04,16
119,Outstanding Venue,"Begona, Alessandro and the whole team gave excellent service and attention to detail. A fabulous venue and hotel.  The location is ideal for access to the O2 and cable car across the river.  The rooms and suites are luxuriously fitted with good quality toiletries and appliances",5,2016,04,16
119,Love Love Love!,"Stayed here on a romantic package deal for mine & my boyfriend's 6 year anniversary, and it was flawless! Customer service was ace, and the food even better! Definitely a luxurious stay for anyone looking to splurge for a special occasion. We had our own private balcony, so watching the sunset from our room was beautiful, especially as the day was had stayed was sunny and warm! So when it got a bit chilly, it was nice to enjoy a cup of tea in the privacy of your own balcony. The room was nice, clean and spacious. Loved the heated flooring in the bathroom too - that was the cherry on the top for me! Will definitely be going back. Beautifully built hotel, being a yacht made it that bit more luxurious ;)",5,2016,04,15
119,A little bit of Luxury on the Thames,"My friend & I had a cheeky weekend away in London , she wanted to stay somewhere luxurious & I being a budget penny pinching traveller found this wonderful place. Pure Luxury & the novelty of staying on a luxury Yacht in the fabulous London Docklands with killer views, great network links into central London, just fabulous really & at a fantastic price.

It was really easy to find very close to the excel centre with 2 Docklands light railway stops nearby , Custom house & Prince Regent. It is great for the O2 arena & Westfield shopping & does not take long to get into central London about 20 mins , top up your Oyster card. 

It is really unusual to stay on a Yacht, the lobby has the most fabulous chandelier & sweeping stairway. The staff are very polite & were more than happy to stow are bags away until are cabins were ready. The Cabins are huge , much bigger than many hotel rooms , with a seating area , we luckily had a river view which was lovely. 
The bathroom was fabulous & came with complimentary Molton Brown toiletries, something to look forward too after a long day sightseeing or shopping. It had a drinks machine which was a nice touch & a Sony tablet in the room to surf the Internet.

The bed was very big & comfortable & we had a good two night sleep. The bar & deck were lovely areas , but we did not eat or drink on the yacht as it was very expensive. But the staff did not object to us chilling in the lounge without a drink. We did not have breakfast as we felt that nearly £20 was expensive ,but I am a penny pinching budget traveller , for what we paid for our cabin it was excellent value for money. I would definitely stay again, I would be interested to stay in her sister ship in Gibralter , I like the concept of staying on board a ship.

We did not use the Spa you had to book well ahead for treatments & the ship does not actually have Spa facilities , but offers treatments , so felt it was a little misleading. 
Overall the Sunborn is a fantastic hotel I highly recommend this yacht.",5,2016,04,15
119,Different type of hotel ,"This is one of Finnish company Sunborn's floating hotels, similar to the one in Gibraltar, but smaller. Very different from any other hotel in London. Slightly more expensive than average but quite manageable if you get a regular room : cabin. I wouldn't pay too much to get a view, because 1) no great view in any direction and 2) you see the views from the bar, restaurant and breakfast room. Perfect location for the Excel, otherwise a bit far from downtown.",4,2016,04,14
119,Nice experience but won't return again,"The room was clean and average although it was an upgraded river view room. Waited 40 mins for a bottle of wine to be delivered to our room. Bed was really comfy. Airplane noise was loud. Close to tube&excel. Evening dinner was fab! Breakfast was average. Reception chandelier and staircase is pretty.
It was pleasant but not special enough for us to revisit.",3,2016,04,13
119,Birthday treat,Great stay at the sunborn lovely room friendly helpful staff great breakfast would definitely stay again lovely room great views great prices great spa and very convenient for visiting the o2 and easy access to central London by tube,5,2016,04,13
119,Great if you are looking for something a little different,"Just stayed for two nights, got a good rate through Groupon, included dinner on one night and two breakfasts. Food was very good and restaurant and bar service excellent. Rooms are very nice, with a balcony and worth the £20 upgrade to have a view of the river. Room furnishings and cleanliness is spot on, although in room 5020, which is right next to the security door into the corridor, you do hear this slam every time someone passes through, which is annoying when you are trying to sleep. If you get a room by this door and you are a light sleeper, I would ask for a room a little further away from these doors. A lovely hotel and ideal for the O2 via the Emirates cable cars or Excel, but it is a bit of a trek into central London, so for this reason...as nice as it is I will probably book somewhere more central next time.",4,2016,04,12
119,Sunborn Yacht / Lands End Restaurant,"Our experience here was OUTSTANDING. 

First of all the Sunborn Yacht looks absolutely amazing and it's the same on the inside with it's classic look. 

We went for our anniversary dinner here and we wasn't at all let down by the exceptional service. The food was delicious and definitely 5* (Kudos to the chef). They put us on a table with a perfect view of the Canary Wharf and o2 skyline. 
The manager Alberto was a polite and well-mannered man who knows how to treat his guests. He went out of his way and used his time to give us an exceptional experience especially when he knew I was going to propose. He made everything run smooth and effortless and gave us plenty of time in the private hall upstairs with it's own deck! Well done Alberto! An exemplar for all managers in this industry! 

After our time on the deck, we walked downstairs to the bar where Alberto greeted us with a smile. He was on hand to answer any questions about the drinks provided and had a in-depth knowledge about many types of drinks on the list. 

Thank you to Alberto + Julian and all the staff involved in making our day special, 

Ali",5,2016,04,11
119,"Glorious boat, poor service, poor location","Not much to do or see in this area of London (at the moment), but the skyline on a clear day is impressive.

We arrived for drinks and asked to be seated outside.  It had clearly been raining over night so the tables and chairs were damp with pools of water...no one cleared this for us.  We did wait, quite some time, but in the end we sorted ourselves.  

Price wise, a cup of coffee was £4, a glass of prosecco was £8...plus service charge (which was a cheek given that we didn't have any service).

As I say, we sat outside.  The boat is directly under the flight path for City Airport...rather nosey at times.

Would I return...no.  The boat itself wasn't special enough to make me want to go again.  Nicer hotels in the area.",3,2016,04,11
119,Great,I had a great time the staff are really nice had good chat with the bar staff(Julian) I'll deffently go back . It's a nice quit area so can properly chill out it it does not take long to get to the centre off London on the train,5,2016,04,10
119,Great stay! ,"We had a wonderful stay and such a unique experience! We was initially put in a room next to the elevator but as soon as I mentioned this they went above and beyond to move us. We was upgraded and put in a lovely room! Easy to get via the tubes and right next to the station. Would definitely recommend! 
",5,2016,04,10
119,Amazing stay on the yacht,"Surprised a friend with a stay on the yacht. Arrival was so great and all team members throughout the stay were always attentive and friendly with a smile. We booked a with a balcony where we enjoyed some drinks. Nice touch having a welcome letter from the General Manager. Told my friend I would like to come back for my birthday!
",5,2016,04,10
119,"Gorgeous yacht, gorgeous stay!",We went to the O2 for the concert of 5 SOS. Had a exciting flight with the cable car and prior to that a delicious burger with excellent cocktails in the bar. Took the tube after the concert and slept wonderful in the most comfortable bed ever. Will come back in August. ,5,2016,04,10
119,"Something a little bit different for an overnight stay, loved it!","We celebrated my Husbands 50th Birthday on the Sunborn with an overnight stay and dinner for 12 people. Rooms were lovely & very spacious, staff were great and food was delicious. Drinks were a bit pricey but no more so than a typical London hotel. There's not much around there by way of pubs & clubs but we took a late afternoon Emirates cable car over to the 02 and had a few drinks in the trendy Ny-Lon bar which was a lovely way to travel & the bar was great too. All in all a wonderful stay, thoroughly enjoyable and would definitely recommend.",5,2016,04,09
119,A Special Occasion Venue,"From the moment you walk aboard the Ship, you feel special. It's a super yacht. Usually these vessels are the playground for the worlds elite. the 1%ers. 
The staff were fantastic, we used both the bar and restaurants, both were excellent. A drink on deck overlooking the dock, was a pleasure in itself.
Rooms were lovely and had everything you would want. Fixtures are first class 
I would also say a special thank you to the general manager, who does his upmost to make sure your stay is memorable.  He runs a good ship.
If you have thought about going. My advice, Do it.....  
He certainly succeeded with us.",5,2016,04,09
119,"Friendly, relaxing with exceptional service","Stayed 1 night as part of my 50th birthday celebration weekend. Very spacious cabin for 3 adults .quick efficient service when requested extra cup/coffee. Breakfast lovely choice good value. staff very friendly, smiles all around. Only downside was couldn't find any information on local area or facilities on board ship in the cabin(would have loved some info. on yachy itself history use etc). Sure it would have been provided but I like to have details on hand..         Not sure if it would feel overcrowded if you booked when full but will look at booking again. Much better than a city based hotel.",4,2016,04,09
119,A wonderful experience,"It was our 25th Anniversary, and from the time I phoned to make the initial reservation we were treated so professionally. The hotel was stunning, staff friendly , attentive and helpful at all times. I have dietary requirements and they were catered for without a fuss. The food was top class. They made the whole experience so memorable and we are thrilled to recommend it and will definitely return.",5,2016,04,08
119,Surprise Night away for Birthday Celebrations,"Just arrived back from a one night away for birthday celebrations on board Sunborn London. Wanted to find something different and this hotel hit the spot, everyone who attended thought it was something very different and a new experience for most of us. The reception staff especially Marviam were very friendly, professional and made you feel at home as soon as we arrived. We stayed in an Executive Room with river views and a balcony, The room was fine with everything we needed for a one night stay and a lot quieter than most main hotels we have used in London before. We used the bar area to meet family, only downside was the good old British weather so we were not able to use the Sun deck at the back of the yacht. We have already discussed going back, just hope next time we pick better weather so we can use the outside areas.",5,2016,04,08
119,Excellent hotel,"Me and my partner booked a 2 night night stay over Easter 2016 as it was my partners 40th birthday. 

Originally we booked the king room, but when I booked online I mentioned it was my partners 40th birthday and wanted it to be a specially occasion for her.

When we got there we were surprised to see we were in a suit. when I queried this , I was told it was a free upgrade because of the special occasion . Wow ! Thank you so much. 
It did indeed turn out to be a fantastic birthday for her and she didn't want to leave the room as it was that nice lol. She especially loved the sauna and jacuzzi style bath .

Thank again, for making both our dreams come true!  Would highly recommend staying . We are going to be booking again soon, hopefully the weather will be better next time lol. ⭐️⭐️⭐️⭐️
",5,2016,04,07
119,Best Choice for East London,"Sunborn Yacht Hotel is my favorite choice when i have to stay in London. Perfect Location as it is only a few minutes from London City Airpot and DLR Station.During summer i love to stay at the terrace with the stunning view to Canary Wharf where they servie international drinks. After so many stays at Hotel i am still impressed when arriving to see the wonderful Yacht on the Water. the spacious rooms are well equiped and have very comfortable beds. as the location is very quiet you'll have a pleasant night The staff is international, very supportive and well educated. The breakfast buffet leaves nothing to be desired, from healthy fruit plate to English breakfast and various cereals, they offer everything.",5,2016,04,07
119,Event with family and friends,"The  whole experience was fab, staff were so helpful amd caring especially Maryiam and Ligita . Food and coctails delicious. room was clean fab view .loads of bars and restuarants close by ,Excel a stones throw away car parking close by (£15 ) for 24 hours which i thought reasonable for london and of course the O2 arena, will definitally  be staying again ...",5,2016,04,07
119,Lovely birthday treat,"My husband booked a night away at the SUNBORN for my birthday treat - when booking he was offered an upgrade for £20 which he decided to avail of and we were given a suite - the room was amazing - clean, spacious, well equipped and complete with chocolates and a coffee maker - the suite had doors out unto a small deck which overlooked the river with two seats and from here you could watch the ducks swim by or see the planes take off overhead.  Once the doors were closed a night no noise could be heard. The bed was comfy and we had a great nights sleep 
We ate both breakfast (buffet style) and dinner in the hotel as part of our package.  Dinner was very much fine dining and we had the veal was delicious. The breakfast buffet had a wide variety of offerings to suit all tastes (sausages and bacon, cheeses, yoghurts, smoked salmon, a wide variety of breads & juices, signs to ask you to inform them if you required gluten free options etc etc
The staff were friendly and with the upgrade this was a very special treat which will stick in my memory for a long time 
",5,2016,04,07
119,Excellent ,"Stayed at the sunborn hotel for my fiancé's 21st birthday. The staff at the reception were very accommodating and very helpful, as we arrived we got given 25% off vouchers for the bar once they had realised it was for a special occasion. The room was lovely and spacious, had a very comfortable king size bed and what felt like heated flooring in the bathroom. There was a nice amount of channels on the TV so didn't get bored in the evening. We had dinner on the first night at the landsend restaurant as part of a Groupon voucher a glass of wine and a main meal was included and anything else was extra cost which we didn't mind. The staff at the restaurant were lovely as well and gave an excellent service, once we returned to our room after dinner a letter had been left from the general manager to wish us a comfortable stay and to thanks us for choosing them for my fiancé's 21st! 

Overall had a fantastic stay and will be coming back sometime in the future :-) ",5,2016,04,07
119,Amazing trip! ,We stayed for my partners birthday and watched Dynamo at the 02 during our stay! It's the perfect location for the 02- you get the Emirates cable cars across- amazing! The boat itself is lovely very luxurious and such a different way to spend you might rather than being in a hotel. Would definitely recommend you won't be disappointed! ,5,2016,04,07
119,Complete comfort,"From the moment you check in you are surrounded by pleasantries. The rooms are of very high standard. The restuarants on board are decorative, fresh and airy with great views of the Thames and London, the food is exceptional.
We have stayed three times now and cannot wait to return.",5,2016,04,07
119,Night away at the Sunborn Yacht Hotel London,"I stayed at the hotel for one evening. The hotel room was very clean and the view was great!! All staff at the hotel were friendly and they was always willing to help! We also ate at the hotels restaurant, which again was lovely. My overall stay at the hotel was fantastic and I recommend anyone booking this hotel. The atmosphere was relaxed and all staff were polite and always there to help.",5,2016,04,06
119,Nice stay but could of been better but staff very polite and friendly,Couldn't walk around the yacht as your key card is locked to your floor and bar restaurant and reception ... After asking at the desk If I can see the spa area I was told the key doesn't let you in but it's just 2 rooms... I was looking forward to a coffee on the deck like the photos on the website but there's was no seating just an and empty space which was closed due to slippery surface ... We looked and it wasn't wet or anything and was a lovely day so was quite disappointed ... I also asked if we could have a walk around to the other side of the boat but again she said there is nothing to see as they are all suites. Don't get me wrong we had a lovely stay but it's just your room the bar and the restaurant. Obviously the spa if you pay extra but no pool or anything. Afternoon tea was very nice but I think a little overpriced for what you get also be aware there is a service charge on your bill each time. 2 bottles of peroni £5 each but with service charge total bill is £11.60. ,3,2016,04,06
119,Feel like a Millionaire!!!!,"This is the second time my partner and myself have stayed onboard the Sunborn yacht hotel. It is truly wonderful. The yacht itself is amazing, the food wonderful and the service and attitude from the staff is second to none - and we have tried many places!!! Thank you Sunborn. Hope to visit you again soon.",5,2016,04,06
119,Fabulous stay,"Can't praise this hotel enough! It's something a little bit different from the norm. Short tube ride to everything, with the best staff, clean and lovely hotel.  Food was also good! Only complaint is the 'lounge' music in the lounge!! Reception staff very helpful, Vadin in particular.  We will be back!",5,2016,04,05
119,Unusual and different,"My partner and I stayed 2 nights,an upgrade to a view of the dock waterside is advisable,the room was comfortable and had everything we required.The staff were all friendly and helpful.The food was excellent both dinner and breakfast.The location is good for the cable car trip and various attractions in Docklands.we enjoyed it very much! Vadim was especially helpful.",5,2016,04,05
119,Lovely break-try something different ,"This was our second stay, our first around 8/10 years back. It seems nothing has changed and we still enjoyed it. My one criticism was there were a few separate groups complaining at different times- to me it seemed they were after something for nothing but maybe they had genuine reasons.
Try and pick a nice day to make the most of it.",5,2016,04,04
119,Restaurant - pick eater review ,"Firstly the review stars that we turned up for a booking I had made- to find i had messed up and booked a similar named restaurant. The staff were amazing. I was upset as it was out wedding anniversary. They Asked if we could wait and they'd fit us in. Took us to the bar and gave us the best table by the windows to wait with an amazing view. 
We then were called as our table was ready. Again given bet table due to most bookings having already eaten (8.45 by this point). 
Now the food. What can I say. Amazing. I'm an incredibly fussy eater but still found something to eat. As with these exclusive restaurants handful of options. Only one thing would have made it better- chicken on the menu. Mosty fish orientated. Only option we would not eat again (all 4 of us had different selections) was the scallops. Compared to the veal and oxtail options- it was a small portion. 
All in all amazing but would check menu before you go. Prices do reflect the amazing restaurant and food so be prepared for that. £8 for glass of wine! ",5,2016,04,04
119,Above and beyond expectations ,"From the moment I saw the boat I was filled with excitement. On entering that excitement increased the first room/cabin was lovely but I upgraded to a room with a balcony over the river. The boat is beautifully looked after and presented and the staff very efficient polite and helpful nothing seems to be too much.
We had breakfast which was plentiful and again the breakfast room was lovely with views of the city and river to complement the food. We ate in the bar one evening and again the ambience was first class with the same views of the city lights. Parking at the local car park quite reasonable at only £15 per day.
Not the cheapest stay in London but worth the spend in the right company. I will definitely return.",5,2016,04,04
119,Wonderful place in great location next to Excel Exhibition Centre and close to City!,"Just 50 m from Excel Exhibition Centre, beautiful Yacht (really special atmosphere) hotel with excellent restaurant and little spa. Perfect place to unwind after busy exhibition or City of London day. And our Executive suite had its own sauna and spa bath, which was wonderful for those cold days beginning of March!",5,2016,04,04
119,My daughters 10th bday,"A beautiful yatch with a lovely, friendly welcome from the staff. We were upgraded to a room with balcony. Lovely spacious clean rooms with all facilities u could ask for. One of the best hotels ive stayed in in london. Enjoyed cocktails in the lounge where they brought my daughter a surprise cupcake for her bday. We had afternoon tea the day after which was ok but compared to the many ive had in london it just didnt come up to par in relation to quantity and price. But we had a lovely stay and would def go back. Thank u☺☺☺",5,2016,04,03
119,Birthday treat,"What a fantastic stay, from the minute we arrived we were made to feel welcome by every member of staff we came into contact with. On arrival into the room there was a personal letter from the manager welcoming us to the hotel, the room itself was large and clean and with the addition of a balcony I couldn't have been more pleased. On arrival into the bar we had a warm welcome by all staff and very attentive to ensuring we had a seat and drink. The restaurant is a lovely area, the food was great and the icing on the cake was a 'happy birthday' plate presented to me at the end of the meal. Attention to detail here is second to none.  All in all I can't praise this place enough and would most definitely return. Well done to all on such a well run and looked after place!!",5,2016,04,03
119,Luxury Yacht that Floated our Boat !,"Stayed for my partners 39th birthday and had an amazing time thank you.  The personal greeting on arrival by Andreas Stys the hotel's GM was a lovely touch and he and his team made every effort to ensure we had a great stay. We had a Exec Riverview room which was worth paying the extra for & was we'll appointed & spotlessly clean with a huge super king sized bed. Had breakfast both mornings & dinner on one night and all food & service were excellent at all times.

Would highly recommend this place to anyone looking for a bit of luxury but also for something that bit different.

Thank you Andreas & team for making Lyndsey's birthday one to remember!

Hope we'll see you again sometime soon.

",5,2016,04,03
119,Birthday Stay,"We stayed here as part of my fiancées birthday trip away in March. We had a excellent time and this place is very luxurious. I would defiantly recommend the river view room as if there is a sunset it looks amazing. We did not eat here for the evening meal but went out to a local restaurant. We had a lovely stay.
Thankyou.
Andy n Linda.  ",5,2016,04,02
119,The yacht itself is absolutely amazing BUT!,"I doubt even the most hard to please will find much to moan about as far as this yacht is concerned. It is a true 4* plus venue. Rooms were clean, warm, large enough and the bed was a king so loads of room!!

The staff on checking in were ok. We elected to go for an upgrade to a balcony room and whilst it was £20 extra per night...well worth this little extra. It allows you to have the door open during the night a there were no windows to open and we like a bit of fresh air!

Large TV and whilst the bathroom was small it was well equipped.  You are directly beneath the flight path for Heathrow so get ready for a plane every two minutes during the day! You loose sound on the TV for 30 seconds every 2 minutes!

That said the planes go somewhere else during the night so between 8pm and 7am ...no planes!!

Right....  we were on a Groupon deal and as stated so far the stay was great. The breakfast was very good, plentiful and on till 10.30am so ..excellent. The staff were friendly and attentive and I wished the breakfast staff had been on for dinner the previous night!! They were not!

The prices on board are stiff to say the ;easy! £9 for a small wine! Starters coming in at over £10! The menu was 'extremely' limited and nowhere near the choice this type of hotel should offer!

The staff were very impressed with themselves and despite my requesting a table for two by a window when we checked in (which did not seem to be a problem at the time)  we were shown to a table in the middle of the room. When I queried this the person in charge said that was the only table available for us at this time. There was a table for four set up by a window but...what the hell...why spoil a good night!

I cannot tell you how annoyed I was when halfway through our meal a couple walked in and sat at the table and the staff cleared the remaining cutlery and 'heypresto'...they had a table for two in the window.....NOT HAPPY!!

All in all....the yacht is fabulous, the rooms a very good, the majority of staff were fine the food quality was excellent but watch out for things like.....when it says 'with broccoli and carrot puree' as you really did have to hunt hard for the  'two minute' broccoli spears and the carrot puree was no more than a colourful 'exclamation mark' on the plate..... 

I personally would not stay again as I could get a similar room in central London 4* for the same money and avoid the inconvenience of the DLR or tube to get there. It is only a 5 minute walk from Custom House DLR station but a taxi would hit you for around £50 from Euston!!

All that said if you were visiting the 'Excel' centre and wished to stay over for the night....it was a unique experience......",4,2016,04,02
119,Marvelous place to stay,"We've been for on first sightseeing-tour to London. We stayed at the Sunborn Yacht, which is a special place to be, since it is not just a hotel, but a huge Yacht, that is placed at Royal Victoria Dock next to the ExCel Congress Center. Besides, it is just a few hundred meters away from the O2, which makes it even more interesting for people visiting a concert, for example.
We had a beautiful room with a very nice and big bed, where I could sleep very well in. Even the starting airplanes of the nearby City Airport couldn't keep me away from relaxing tremendously. The service und friendliness of all employees was overwhelming at any time of day, no matter how busy they where. Always a smile, a decent question, if everything has been alright, really with a lot of care, but never being intrusive or pushy.
I have to admit, that Sunborn Hotel is a bit far away from central city, but being a fan of Underground, you're soon into everything, the city can offer.
In summary we (my 12-year-old son and I) are very thankful for our beautiful stay at Sunborn Hotel and we'll come back as soon as we can.",5,2016,04,01
119,Lovely boat,Lovely boat very clean and comfortable.great views. Drinks are expensive. Staff very friendly. If you go on the Groupon deal please watch the small print we got stung on the dinner. We were told by the staff serving us the set menu was included in the offer but turned out it was just the main course. ,4,2016,03,31
119,Overnight stay for visit to the O2,"Fantastic experience, a really different & top class hotel. Easy to get to & must try the the cable car ride if you are going south of the river from here.
The hotel itself is immaculate, great service and stunning views, the one, very small downside was the aircraft noise from nearby London city airport, but it did not detract from our enjoyment.
",5,2016,03,31
119,Amazing stay!,"We stayed in the best room on the boat with the most amazing balcony that would fit 20 people! We had a living room, bedroom, bathroom (with jacuzzi bath, twin showers and a sauna!), separate toilet and spacious hallway. We were blown away by how nice the room was. Breakfast was included and a great way to start the day with views over the water.
Perfect if you are visiting the o2 or the Excel! The only downside was the noise from the planes in and out of City Airport (although this was cool to watch for the first hour or so!) but it would not put me off staying here again! Great hotel!",5,2016,03,31
119,Shame I could not give 5*,"As it states in the title....and it'so only down to the decor as it feels a bit dated and not luxurious!! Definitely different to the one in Gibraltar!  What a great idea of the hotel!! Love the feel of the hotel, very convenient for o2, staff very attentive, breakfast nice....perhaps I would include it in the price.....but to make it a little more luxurious and cosier would not take long.....would I come back? Of course I would but only it there is a deal!",4,2016,03,31
119,Sunborn - 10/10,"We had a fab time staying on the boat, I couldn't say a bad word about any of it.  The boat was in spotless condition and the rooms were excellent.  The staff were very helpful and friendly.  Lovely breakfast. We are already looking to go back in July. ",5,2016,03,31
119,Lovely hotel in london.,My husband and i recently stayed for our 30th wedding anniversary. We had a wonderful room with a fridge for our convenience with complimentary water replaced daily. We enjoyed a superb dinner with wine on our first evening with first class service as was breakfast each morning. Thankyou for a lovely stay.,5,2016,03,30
119,Sunborn london ,"Myself and my 9 year old daughter stayed at the sunborn for a mother daughter getaway. Our room was lovely and clean and we found the tablet to be useful and a nice touch instead of the more traditional folders. Would also recommend rooms with the river view as it was lovely to sit outside in the evening looking at canary wharf and watching the world go by. Slightly outside central London but still a great location and only a few minutes walk from the station. We ate elsewhere for dinner but breakfast was delicious. Buffet style but had everything from full English to continental, granola, fruits and yoghurt to cold meats and cheese. Will definitely be back and would like to thank Ligitta on reception who made us feel so welcome and couldn't do enough to answer our questions and help any way she could.",5,2016,03,29
119,Visit to Sunborn,"My friend and I celebrated our 50th birthdays with an event at The O2 and then had a wonderful stay at Sunborn. The staff were lovely and solicitous, the room was amazing and the food delicious :-)

Will visit again soon!",5,2016,03,29
119,Lovely for a special occasion,I booked at night at the Sunborn for my husband's birthday. I had got tickets for the O2 and the yacht hotel was very conveniently located for this. We arrived and when we were checking in I mentioned that it was a birthday treat for my husband and a member of the reception staff very kindly gave us a voucher each for a free cocktail in the bar which was unexpected and a really nice gesture. All of the staff on board were really helpful and we had a lovely stay. We were in a river view room which was extra special and the room we had was very spacious and beautifully decoracted/designed. Checkout is at 12pm but we were running a bit late so I rang reception to ask if we could extend it by an hour and they were happy to oblige which was very handy too!  ,4,2016,03,29
119,Sundown Bar at Sunborn,"The highlight of my trip was when I was introduced to Julian in the Sundown Bar. He has extensive knowledge of whiskey and scotch. If this is your thing, I highly recommend asking for Julian and you will not be disappointed. 

The rooms are large and feature a desk, couch, and king size bed. It was at bit cold outside, for my California blood, so I didn't experience much of those areas. From what I saw, it looked like a pleasant area to relax. 

As others have mentioned, it is a bit outside of central London. This was convenient for me as I was attending an exhibition at the Excel center. 

I am scheduled to return next year and will be staying here again.",5,2016,03,28
119,Visit on 27th March 2016,"Me and my girlfriend stayed at the Sunborn London yacht hotel last night 27th March. The hotel it's self was lovely clean and nice. The only bad thing was some of the staff was rude they looked down on us. We are a young couple I'm 25 my girlfriend is 23 and because we don't look upper class and like we have a lot of money they treated us different. When booking the hotel I requested early check in I got to the hotel about 1:50pm but could not check in until 3pm even though we requested it but I was not fussed as the hotel was nice and why was waiting got to have a look around. We was sitting down in the waiting area opposite the reception desk and one of the woman staff kept looking over at us why talking to her colleague they made it obvious they was talking about us, it was extremely uncomfortable. When it came to 3 o clock I went to the desk to ask for the key for the room they didn't bother telling me nothing to do with the hotel about the restaurant what floor it's on even though I booked a table for dinner. I could hear one of the other staff asking her guest about there travel here and telling them about facilities they have on the boat which I got none of that all I got is the key and enjoy your stay why they took payment for the room upfront. We only paid for the room no food included which was fine but when we got to the restaurant they gave us there basic menu where you get the package dinner if you paid for dinner and room deal. When I asked if they had another menu as I did not like the sound of some of the meals on there and mentioning I am paying for our food the waiter said wait a minute and went and got her manager he came over and I asked him if they had another menu as I am paying for dinner and I did not fancy the food options on this one.  They finally ended up bringing another menu over but we felt very uncomfortable as there was 3 of them standing there kept looking over at us, even why we was waiting for dinner I no it sounds silly but it showed we was different. The waiters brought a roll each over to us with butter and minutes after a couple came   and sat next to us. They got there rolls and after finishing they got offered another. I no it's only a roll and I don't want to seem like I'm complaining about a roll because I'm  not I just wanted to be treated the same as the other guests on the boat. We was the only young couple at the hotel and the way we was treated compared to the other guests was a joke. My girlfriend has been hinting for a good while how she wants to get married I was actually going to propose   to her that night as I thought that would be a perfect place to do it. My family like to throw a party for things like that so I was also interested in hiring out there hall to have an engagement party on as mine and her family live all over. But the way we was treated on the boat I did not feel like this was the right place. They certainly need to sort there staff out. If your a young couple I would think more than twice before booking here. If there staff was not stuck up and looked down on people who do not look upper class this would be a nice hotel. ",1,2016,03,28
119,4th March,"We stayed at the Sunborn London for one night whilst visiting Lee Valley VeloPark for the UCI World Track Cycling champs. It suited our purpose very well for getting to Stratford via the DLR and underground. The room was very clean but the outside of the window a bit dirty so that obscured the view a little bit. The hair dryer in the room didn't work, the reception staff were happy to send someone to look at it straight away. The cocktails were delicious but the breakfast was a little disappointing - tinned fruit. Would stay here again.",4,2016,03,28
119,"Fantastic night, couldn't fault anytbinf","We spent one night on this yacht and we couldn't fault a thing. The staff were fantastic from the very beginning. Our room was perfect, clean and tidy and we paid an extra £20 for a river view (which is worth it) 
We didn't feel like we caused any trouble by asking for extra coffee or any extras at dinner. The staff were happy to help at any time. 
The dinner was fantastic and would definitely recommend eating on the boat if you stay. The decor is brilliant too.
Breakfast is a buffet style breakfast and again, was lovely. Staff again are happy to help with any request. 
Would 100% recommend staying here and would return myself.
Extremely happy with our stay. ",5,2016,03,28
119,Great stay,"It was nice stayed in Sunborn yacht hotel.
Although, the location was quite far from central London staying this hotel is worth it.

Only thing I would like to say is that when I stayed in yacht-side room the view was not nice. Like you can exactly see dirty water and many rubbish flow in the water. So me and my partner tried to see other view from other place which is Sun deck (located in 5th floor) was temporarily closed when I visited there. However, the rest were great. Great staffs, facilities and room. ",3,2016,03,27
119,Sunborn magic,The sunburn London is a lovely little get away with parking close by and many local amenities. The yacht itself no longer movers but is 'decked' out well and very relaxing. We used it as a base to go to and from the O2 and it was perfect. The staff are polite and service is great. I would strongly recommend. Plus the rooms are bigger and better equipped than others. ,5,2016,03,27
119,A class Act!!!!,"It was a very special occasion and I was so much looking forward to my stay and the hotel did not fail to disappoint our expectation.

Where do I start with this hotel.....I read the reviews and was just excited like a school kid going to the fair....honestly just book this place..Looking for another excuse to book it again (I might as well have a birthday treat once a month..hehe!)

The rooms were huge by other hotel standards....Loved the space in the rooms and make sure you get a sea-view. Cant say anything about the breakfast as we opted not to have breakfast as we left early.

Point to note: entrance to the bathroom is raised and I kept knocking my toe on it. Also parking is a bit of a walk if you have luggage.

Looking forward to a stay when the weather is nice as it was raining during my 2 day stay.",4,2016,03,27
119,Amazing value for money!!,"Stayed in sunborn London at 11th of March.

This yate is absolutely amazing!

First experience in a yate,
Feels very posh and luxurious
Staff very friendly 
After a night out, when we arrive left us chocolate truffles on room(was amazing)
Just want to thank all the staff and keep going with this amazing job!!

Well done

119,"Lovely big rooms, yummy breakfast, nice staff! Lovely to stay somewhere a bit different.","Lovely big room with a view out over the river, friendly helpful staff (especially the ladies on breakfast), great location - we were at the o2 for a concert so this was really nearby, not much more expensive than a standard hotel and much cooler! Wish we could have stayed a bit longer.",5,2016,03,25
119,London Luxury,"We booked 4 rooms this week for a family outing in London, we got a fantastic price on line and the Hotel was absolutely fabulous in all respects, only down side is about 7 minute walk from the Victoria Dock car park or DLR station,",5,2016,03,25
119,Excellent and amazing hotel,Amazing from the beginning till the end stayed one night as it was my partners birthday what can i say the whole staff were fantastic and very helpful special thanks to the manager made us welcome even though we were early as well as Maryiam at reception Rita our afternoon tea waitress and Edgar our dinner waiter thank you all for making our stay a special one.,5,2016,03,25
119,"Just what we needed, really impressed","Can't recommend this as a place to stay in London highly enough. Right outside the eXcel conference centre, range of bars and restaurants outside. A relaxed and quiet area yet easily accessible by DLR.

Rooms are spacious, clean and comfortable, a good night sleep. Only downside was the attempted upselling at check in, if I'd wanted to pay extra for a Riverview I would have when I booked!

Great place to stay when heading to O2 which is easily reached by cable car.",4,2016,03,25
119,Wedding Anniversary,"This was an special treat for us in our wedding anniversary, it was without a doubt a different experience with a touch of the by gone days of cruise luxury with out leaving London.
We will be back :)",5,2016,03,24
119,Short Break,"Considering we were at this Hotel on a good value combined theatre and hotel break it was amazing. Lovely rooms, breakfast was fantastic ans all the staff were so friendly and helpful. Top marks from me.",5,2016,03,24
119,Amazing,Booked this for my boyfriends 25th via a groupon deal and didnt know what to expect but it was a really special trip lovely relaxed experience lovely chilled bar area with a view the food in the restaurant was good and breakfast was really good! Room was big with a sofa and tv. Biggest thing for me is the staff were all so friendly. The guy behind reception gave us really good service (eastern european man) loved everything about our stay and will be returning!,5,2016,03,23
119,Not a great start,"I feel we may have been slightly unlucky with this trip. 
 Upon arrive a stone (yes a stone) was dropped from the staircase and barely missed my head. The concierge quickly removed it... Was shocked. 
 Couldn't order room service as there was no menu or any information about the boat etc. 
 The television didn't work. The staff said they would call maintenance. It didn't work our entire stay. 
 A member of the staff walked straight into our room with a quick knock... She did look rather shocked to see us. 
 Our key card didn't work, I then walked back to 3 floor to report it, and an arrogant receptionist told me I was on the wrong floor( yes I am now, because reception is on a different level) 
 All of the above has annoyed me, as we where looking for something different hence choosing Sunborn Yacht..... ",2,2016,03,23
119,Overnight for a dinner party with author Kieran Levis and GoFigurative founder Sally Vaughan,"A fantastic location for a unique hotel concept. I was served drinks by Jaroslaw and Tea who were charming and friendly. I can't comment on the food as I ate elsewhere, however the dining facilities looked elegant and tranquil. 
The decor owes a little too much to the owners' probable Middle Eastern provenance (a little glitzy and fussy for my taste) but it is a wonderful experience overall. ",4,2016,03,23
119,Amazing ,"Just stayed here for the night with my partner, lovely spacious room looking over the Thames. Very friendly staff and amazing hotel, well worth the money. Also went to the bar for a cocktail, very strong! Plenty of restaurants near by and the O2 a cable car ride away. Will definitely stay again",5,2016,03,22
119,Best mini break hotel ever,Easy to find.. parked at the 02 and took cable car over river.  Rooms are fantastic with own deck balcony.  Food is a la carte.. cocktails are great.  Lovely breakfast. Rooms are quiet despite under flight path of city airport.  Step away from the excel,5,2016,03,22
119,Amazing Experience,"Everything about this yacht hotel was excellent. It had just opened and the staff were all new but were all very professional and attentive. It was a bit of a problem finding it, however it could have been our cab driver. Rooms were above average in size. Restaurant was excellent. Concierge was top notch.",5,2016,03,21
119,Best weekend break EVER!!!!,"Best weekend break ever!!!! My husband and I frequently like a weekend break away - and have been to many places in England and abroad-
But this beats them all!!! 
A birthday surprise and boy was he surprised- fantastic venue - beautiful views across the river- esp. at night when Canary Wharf is alight!
The cabin was gorgeous and the central staircase was stunning
And then the food!! We ate overlooking Canary Wharf- the food was amazing!!",5,2016,03,21
119,Birthday/Anniversary treat,"Arrived at Sunborn slightly early for check-in, but receptionist was very pleasant and it wasn't even mentioned. Room was beautiful and had everything we needed. Bed was the most comfortable I've ever slept in - even better than my memory foam one at home! Breakfast was delicious and I couldn't fault a thing. They even kept our case until late the next evening so we didn't have to drag it around London all day. Before we collected it, we popped into Top 1 Forever restaurant just down the dockside and had a wonderful meal that was so good, we didn't want it to end! Recommend both Sunborn and restaurant if you're wanting to treat yourselves.",5,2016,03,21
119,Second time was hoping for an improvement ,Well the wine has gone up from 5 pounds to 9. The atmosphere is still the same dead atmosphere there is a bar tender guy that's very nice. But the bar staff let a person who was taking very loudly on FaceTime on her apple laptop was really not a relaxing environment. I did say something but got shrugged  off I was hoping for a nice relaxing glass of wine after work. I should have known better. Such a disappointment again. I won't be going back and wouldn't advice anyone else to for a relaxing drink. ,1,2016,03,21
119,Excellent stay,"What a lovely place to stay. It is beautifully decorated and all in keeping with the boat theme. We stayed for our wedding anniversary and the staff couldn't have been more accommodating. We dropped our luggage off for safe keeping while we explored the sights of London and then when we returned and were given our room key we found our luggage already there. We upgraded to a river view room and we're glad we did as the view of the Thames of an evening was lovely. The food in the restaurant was superb as was the service, we then went down and enjoyed some more drinks and coffee in the bar and again the staff couldn't have been more accommodating. All in all I would thoroughly recommend a stay here",5,2016,03,21
119,Friend's Birthday treat,"Beautiful inside, staff are great, from  the receptionist, the managers, the waiters/ waitress, all just top class professional and pleasant. Booked it for a friends Birthday through Groupon so we had a pretty decent deal. Rooms are a 10/10, food 10/10 can't really fault it. Recommend the Lamb. Absolutely beautiful! Breakfast again was fab.",5,2016,03,20
119,Brilliant experience ,Had an absolutely wonderful experience staying on the sunborn in London. Rooms very luxurious even thought we were in the cheapest rooms. we would recommend this hotel for a wonderful weekend away. The staff are all very courteous and made our stay memorable. Will be returning soon and will be recommending to everyone. Didn't have dinner on Saturday evening however we did have breakfast and really enjoyed it. ,5,2016,03,20
119,Afternoon tea afloat!,"We had a lovely afternoon tea on this beautiful yacht just by Londons Excel Centre. Food was good, service very good and the views down the river made it feel a bit special. Transport links make it easy to get to on the DLR too. I would just warn against drink prices if you use the bar, it was the most expensive G&T I think I have ever had!",4,2016,03,20
119,Expensive but stunning,"We hired out part of the Sundown Bar for a business reception after an event at the ExCeL venue just next door. The staff were extremely helpful and efficient about our booking and all the bits and pieces to make it go smoothly. The views from the bar and the deck over the river to Docklands, with Central London in the distance, were stunning. The drinks were fine, and the canapes were absolutely fantastic, with excellent service. The only downside was that it was very expensive, but that is understandable given the location and the quality. Worth it if you have the money!",4,2016,03,20
119,Groupon Deal well worth the money,Had a brilliant time. Better than what we imagined and well worth the money. We done the Groupon deal for 3 nights and enjoyed every night. It's very luxurious and is well worth the visit. I would definitely do it again.,5,2016,03,20
119,Luxurious mini break ,The yacht certainly has the wow factor . The room was a large suite with a queen size bed and sofa area. There was the usual kettle plus a Lavazza coffee machine. The toiletries in the shower were Molten Brown . It all felt very luxurious. We had a window facing the land . We were offered an upgrade when we arrived facing the water for an additional £20 which we declined . We had pre booked the afternoon tea which we had overlooking Victoria Dock in the spring sunshine. At £22 each I thought it was good value for London. The only downside was the area around the yacht is very quiet with very little going on . We caught the DLR and tube into central London which took approx 40 mins. ,4,2016,03,19
119,Luxurious fun,We found this unusual hotel on a deal . So thought why not as we were very curious to see waht it was like .and we were not dissapointed it was very unique and had beautiful fixtures and fittings the bedroomor should say cabin was very very nice spotlessly clean and looked brand new . With a large queen size bed Good  air conditioning and because of location very quiet we had a fantastic nights sleep.amd didn't want to get up. And had everything you needed .all staff were very helpful and we had a lovely evening meal all very nice and ample breakfast again everything was very good with a huge choice . We found it very quiet on this yacht and the bar very pricey would of stopped for a second drink if it was cheaper very off putting to be fair and maybe some music or just something to stop the boredom. So back to room it was and tv put to to good use. Just wish there was some instant coffee in room when you don't have time to faf around with coffee machine .a tip is it takes 45mins on train in to centre of London but is next to excel. And near o2.,5,2016,03,18
119,Great Hotel,"We stayed here as we were attending a three day music festival at the O2. The hotel is ideally situated for the Excel and O2 Arenas and is close to the Emirates Cable Car.
The hotel is very stylish and the cabin we stayed in was spacious and well appointed with a nice view over the river. The room was exceptionally clean and the bed was one of the most comfortable I have slept on in a hotel. The staff were polite and friendly and the breakfast was fantastic, ( however if you are not into full English breakfast, then it may be a bit limiting. Also the coffee served was just not good enough for this class of hotel, but they did change it for something better when we asked and could not have been more helpful). It is really very very close to transport links and there are coffee shops and restaurants on the doorstep. 
However if you are more interested in central London sights this may not be the most convenient, but I would recommend this hotel as it was a pleasure to stay there and a luxurious treat.",5,2016,03,17
119,Sunborn Luxury,"A stunning place to stay! If you want to feel a million dollars then this is your place!
Every member of staff made you feel special, the bedroom was beautiful and we had a river facing room with a balcony, we had complimentary water in the fridge, we put a few drinkies in the fridge to enjoy on the balcony!
Restaurant was full, and rightly so as the food and service was sublime! We have booked to go back for 2 nights in july",5,2016,03,17
119,The London Boat Show,"When visiting the London Boat Show, where better to stay than on a boat? This super yacht transformed into a luxury hotel has a stunning reception area setting the scene on arrival for your stay. Enter via the lift from Royal Victoria dockside right opposite the ExCeL so perfect location. 
Rooms are spacious and well equipped and have a classic contemporary feel with walnut finish units and a big comfortable bed. 
Staff are very helpful and the whole atmosphere makes the stay feel like a real treat. Try dining in the Lands End; a fine dining restaurant on board overlooking the dock and Canary Wharf.",5,2016,03,16
119,Lovely hotel,"Lovely hotel, esp when you like boats, or the idea of sleeping at a boat. Friendly people at the front desk, comfortable room(with a view over the Docklands), great bed, good shower and an iron board in the room. I slept well, didn't test the restaurant, but the room service was ok (not that many options).",4,2016,03,16
119,Fantastic!,"Best hotel room we've ever stayed in, has everything from coffee machine to Molton Brown in the bathroom and lovely dressing gowns and slippers!  Very friendly and attentive staff. Had a great meal in the restaurant. Fabulous place to stay. Can't fault it and would highly recommend it!",5,2016,03,15
119,Wow wow wow,"Stayed here with my young family for a night before sightseeing in London.
First impressions, a yacht in London? Amazing. And it totally was amazing. The staff were very friendly and always on hand to help.
The room was lovely, very clean and ship shaped. We had an evening bar meal in the lounge, which was spot on just a shame it was a march evening or we would of sat outside on deck and eaten. 
Breakfast was amazing so much to choose from and again was everything you'd expect from being on a yacht. 
Look forward to staying here again in the summer. ",5,2016,03,15
119,A Hotel with a difference!,"Moored in Victoria Dock very close to the Excel Centre creates a great impression on arrival. The hotel is well appointed and all appears spick and span. Reception staff efficient and helpful. Rooms are spread over 5 floors, try to get one overlooking the dock rather than the quayside. Our room, on the 1st. floor was large and airy and had a good view of the O2 building and many other interesting views through the picture window, many more continental style plug points tan uk style, take an adapter or two.
Cannot comment on Dinner etc, but drinks appeared dear. Breakfast was included in our booking and was most enjoyable. For access to Central London the Docklands Light Railway is very close.",5,2016,03,15
119,Behind Excel fair complex,"Amazing room and 5 star rate at all.A lot of staff quiq service at Lobby,bar ,Restaurant
Value for money because original is a 5 star not as official 4 star.Not any noice from engine/generator because the ship take electricity from ashore.
New fresh decoration and our room with balcony and bathroom.queen size bed
Very nice taste at restaurant can rate as 1 star michellin and value for money menu for lunch or dinner",5,2016,03,15
119,Great City break.,My wife and I treated my 10 year old to a night on this lovely boat for his birthday.Had a great time staff and facilities were first class.Thank you It is a real gem.My wife and lad struggled with the food on the menu but the staff let them choose from the bar menu which worked.,5,2016,03,14
119,Great birthday treat!,"I took my girlfriend here for her birthday. We arrived in the afternoon and went up the lift to the very grand reception. The front desk informed us that our room was being prepared so they took our luggage and we went to the restaurant where I had pre-booked afternoon tea. We had a lovely view of the O2 and the dock, the sandwiches and cakes that came with afternoon tea were very nice and the waitress was very attentive. We then checked in to our Executive King Room which was one of the cleanest rooms I have every stayed in, had a huge comfy bed and a very decent shower. The room is also very large and nice to relax in whilst you get ready as well as when you return for the evening. We later had dinner on the yacht which was exceptional, even better than what I was expecting. The service also matched how good the food was and our waiter Brian attended to our every need as well as providing my girlfriend with a birthday desert from the kitchen that we were not expecting. We had a great nights sleep, especially considering how close London City Airport is, we did not hear any noise of the planes at all, not one bit! Even checking out was pleasant with the front desk and manager Romao taking great pride that we had enjoyed our stay so much. I would highly recommend this hotel to any couple for a romantic city break.",4,2016,03,14
119,Wonderful Wonderful Wonderful!,"I've been a few times to this floating hotel and every time its great. The staff and the welcome are lovely, the room is amazing and the view from the bar is awesome. On my previous visit I had afternoon tea and also a massage in the spa. They were able to cater for my gluten intolerance which was brilliant.",5,2016,03,14
119,My birthday treat,"My wife suprised me with a night on this beautiful floating hotel, it was easy to get to and even easier to find. We arrived in reception and was greated by very friendly staff and although we was early our room was ready for us.

The room had a lovely balcony overlooking the Thames. We went for a walk about the ship and ended up in a sun drenched lounge where we were served up our drinks by a great waiter called Julian, who's knowledge on wines and drinks was 1st class.

We then got ready and went to the restaurant where once again the food was lovely and the staff all so friendly and attentive.

Definitely be back ....Marco",5,2016,03,13
119,21st Birthday,"I organised a 1 night stay for my other halfs 21st Birthday and it was amazing from start to finish.
The deal included breakfast, dinner & a glass of wine and our stay couldn't be better. I 100% recommend this hotel. A huge thank you for the staff decorating the room with 21st Decorations that I sent via post before we came.",5,2016,03,12
119,A room with a view!,"This hotel is great if you want something a little different. We had a river view room, definitely worth it to make the most of the experience. The rooms are a great size, well equipped and really comfy. The staff were very polite and friendly.",5,2016,03,12
119,Interesting........,"A cruise without any fear of seasickness!
Glitzy. Lots of glass, gilt, marble and polished wood.
Upsides - the novelty of a small luxury ship in London. Room (superior double) was large comfortable and spotless. Small but usable balcony. Breakfast was decent if unspectacular. The staff (criticised elsewhere) were terrific. From first welcome to final departure and all drinks in between. Discreetly attentive, polite and pleasant. A tightly run ship!!! Very handy for Excel and the Dome. Stylish.
Downsides - far out of town so not an ideal base for a central London break, although dock lands railway is excellent. Pricey! Lounge could benefit from a little brightening up. Bold contrast cushions would lift it. The matching settees/cushions flatten the atmosphere a little in what is otherwise a very glamorous ship. Piped music a tad irritating, but that my simply have not been to our taste!
Overview- a perfectly good experience. If you're at excel, or flying via City airport then far and away the best place to stay. Enjoyed it.",4,2016,03,12
119,Wonderful stay on the sun born.,"We stayed for 1 night last Saturday .. 
It was a wonderful experience from start to finish. Very friendly staff.
We stayed in a dock side room, which was massive. 
The breakfast had a huge variety, all hot and fresh, and at £12.50 I thought was quite reasonable.
In the room they supplied a tablet, which I thought, along with the free wifi a nice touch.
It is a very short walk to the cable car ride, which we also did and can recommend. 
There was a slight problem with our bill which was swiftly sorted out by the very friendly and helpful reception manager, Romao..",5,2016,03,11
119,Lovely!,"Myself and 2 friends went for my friend's surprise birthday. The service received from a particular individual named Edgar was lovely. When we asked him questions about what was presented on the menu, he answered in a clear, friendly manner. The quality of the food was amazing. The taste of the food was so rich. I believe the portion sizes were just right as when we left we didn't feel overly full but we were highly satisfied. 

Would definitely go again and recommend anyone to go.",5,2016,03,11
119,Girls night out,Such a lovely friendly and welcoming hotel the service was excellent food wine 5* quality and the staff were really helpful and lovely too not forgetting the food would recommend that roast duck the best I have ever had. Wouldn't mind going there again not forgetting the rooms nice and Cousy and has everything you need. ,5,2016,03,11
119,Best place to relax,I spend two nights at the Hotel and loved it. its a little outside of the city but still close enough to be within 20 min at the city center. the team provides a great service. the rooms have a good size and offer what a business traveler needs. I will come back with my family next time to have a good time.,5,2016,03,10
119,Something Different....great night...,"We had a night on the Sunborn in early March (Combined Christmas and Anniversary present bought for us by our children). 

We travelled to Stratford Tube Station, and then caught the DLR to Custom House, once there it was approx 5-10 minute walk to the Sunborn. 

We checked in mid afternoon, and were given directions to our room.
The room was fab, large with a king-sized bed, lounge area with settee and coffee table, with window overlooking the river. The room had a coffee maker (pods provided), flat screen TV, mini bar (stocked with complimentary still and fizzy water, anything extra to this needs to be paid for). A beautiful bathroom with large shower.
Must say the bed was the most comfortable I have slept in in ages.

After a scrub up and a coffee we went to the bar for drinks, (little expensive, but hey....it is London and this is something different.....approx £5 for a small bottle of beer, £8 for a glass of wine or prosecco. (But you do get complimentary peanuts.......)

We ate that evening in the Lands End Restaurant, not cheap, but very nice (approx £50/head plus drinks). Excellent service, big thank you to our waiter for explaining what the dishes were.

Breakfast the next morning (£12/person, non residents allowed in....we brought our daughter along to join us for breakfast. Typical buffet, fresh fruit, cereals, croissants, full English....all help yourself....so you wont leave hungry.
(If you don't want to eat on the boat, there is plenty of restaurants and a pub within walking distance.)

Check out is around 12 the next day, but there is a free left luggage room, we left our bags there and visited the O2 for a few hours before heading  home.
(To get to the O2 is easy....approx 150m walk to the Emirates sky lift, the £3.50/person to get over the river to the O2)

All in all....a very nice stay, something different, staff friendly and efficient, food lovely,  
book it...you wont be disappointed. 

Will definitely be returning.......",5,2016,03,10
119,Luxury in Docklands,"Everything was very good.  Yacht was easy to find.  Just a short walk from DLR station.

Check in was smooth and room was lovely. 

The only downside for us was getting a taxi from outside on a Friday night, nothing around.  
Breakfast was ok.  I have had better though.
Would recommend the hotel for the experience.",4,2016,03,10
119,Never slept better,"I booked this hotel using an event site. Big surprise after few weeks when i looked it up and found this was a yacht. I was afraid to have small room and wouldnt get decent sleep.  What a surprise : Big, luxurious room. Amazing view from my room on the thames and surroundings. Never slept better than in this hotel. Breakfast with an amazing view. Dinner was excellent but the amount was rather on the small side and the price on the high side. Overall excellent hotel to which i will return if there is an opportunity.",5,2016,03,09
119,Mother's day - Afternoon Tea only - AMAZING,"With my wife being a lover of afternoon tea and having experienced them in hotels in London, for mother's day I wanted the scenery and set to be different from her norm, so I booked the Sunborn Yacht and from outside, it was spectacular.  The yacht is huge and so clean, so first impression was great.  As we entered the reception, we was directed to the restaurant, but before we headed that way, we had to take in the beautiful decor and lighting inside.  The afternoon tea experience was absolutely wonderful, from customer service to food & beverages.  As my wife said, ""This was the best afternoon tea I have been to"".  I didn't spent any time in the rooms, so I can't speak on that front, but for afternoon tea, I definitely would come back again.",5,2016,03,07
119,Something different and special,"Sitting in the bar overlooking the deck to the dock and the dome is one just one of the things that make staying here that little bit more special than an ordinary hotel on land.  the service was generally excellent (although the drinks service in the bar could be a little slow) and the rooms were excellently fitted out and spotlessly clean.

All in all an excellent place to stay providing you check your late night travel arrangements",5,2016,03,07
119,Group Business Trip,"Reception staff were extremely helpful, the rooms were very clean, large and lavish. Travelled as a group of 13 on a business trip. Unbelievable value for money, backed by superb service all 13 people in the group said they would use the hotel again. Early morning flight from London City Airport so didn't manage to sample the breakfast unfortunately.",5,2016,03,07
119,Most amazing birthday ever! ,A group of 8 of us stayed in the Sunborn for 2 nights. This hotel is stunning. Staff couldn't do enough for us. Massive comfy bed. Posh chandeliers and beautiful staircases. Food was beautiful in the restaurant. Stunning views over London. I would go again tomorrow if I could. ,5,2016,03,06
119,Afternoon tea,"We took our Mum for afternoon tea and I will be returning back.
As you enter you are greeted with a grand staircase with a chandelier which sets the scene perfectly.
The atmosphere is relaxing and the staff are warm and welcoming.
There was a wide range of teas, I had the ginger and pear which was lovely.
There was one hiccup which was the cream had gone sour but this was quickly rectified and didn't ruin our day.
There is a lot of choice and if you would like more sandwiches just ask, there is no extra charge. ",4,2016,03,06
119,Best night's sleep for a while!,"Luxurious, clean and reasonably priced for what you get. The rooms (cabins!?) are generous and extremely comfortable. Sunburn offers a secure and peaceful environment in an otherwise busy Docklands setting. It is convenient for DLR and although onboard prices are expensive (you pay for the setting) there are plenty of alternatives nearby.",5,2016,03,06
119,Could have been perfection ,"Myself and my partner have just returned from a visit here for our anniversary. Firstly I just want to start by saying the staff in the restaurant were amazing. The food was perfection as was the afternoon tea and the staff couldn't do enough for you. We almost missed out on this however, after the reception staff told us it was impossible to eat here without a reservation two weeks in advance. After my partner came back and told me this, he could clearly see my disappointment as he knew I'd been looking forward to our trip enormously, he therefore went up to the restaurant in person where the staff were only too happy to find us a table for that very evening. I'm unsure why the reception staff were so unhelpful as the lady who checked us in was also rude and dismissive, barely bringing herself to hand us the room keys and giving us zero information on our room or how to find it! 
The room was lovely and clean, the only criticism I have is that the windows are dirty and this ruins the river view quite considerably (not sure how often the outside is cleaned given the location and size of the hotel so not really a massive issue and easily forgiven). 
We were hoping to return for my birthday however the reception staff have put me off. I believe the man who told us we couldn't eat there registered this upon our departure as he offered us a free upgrade should we book again. I am however, dubious that this would indeed be the case if I was to call and book for my birthday. 
Overall, a lovely hotel in a lovely location and the food is to die for! ",4,2016,03,06
119,Perfect!,"Wonderful stay at the Sunborn last night. Room was spacious, well equipped, beautiful bed and oh so quiet - perfect! Very good location, quick into central London, cheap parking, very friendly staff and wonderful food. Can't ask for any more than that! Highly recommended!",5,2016,03,06
119,Very good location,"We booked this hotel as we were travelling to Spain via London City Airport.  It was also our 41st Wedding Anniversary.  I emailed to let them know and hoped we would have a little bit  of special treatment.  When we arrived we were given someone else's form to fill out.  (I think they have a language problem at times).  We were given a room overlooking the Excel,  which was very nice but no upgrade.  Booked an early table in the restaurant.  Not a good table and obviously no one knew we were celebrating our anniversary.  The staff were very confused and the waiter changed his mind 3 times trying to explain the starter.  In the end I just asked for whatever the Chef preferred.  (Another lost in translation moment).  I think for this level of dining the staff need a lot more training.  The food was average (crab salad served on a boiling hot plate), Nothing outstanding. The staff apologised and said they would try harder next time.  Too little too late.",3,2016,03,06
119,Fabulous ,"Went with my wife for a special occasion. It 
was so enjoyable and beautiful. Staff so friendly and courteous. Lavazza machines in the rooms! Loved it. Reception happy to give extra supplies. Sundown bar fab! Great food and service. Had olives, bread basket and drinks. ",5,2016,03,05
119,Amazing luxurious and simply beautiful,"The cleanest hotel ever visited. Never seen anything like it. Room so spacious, clean and well presented with bespoke furniture. Staff super friendly. Do visit the Sundown Bar where you can enjoy the ambiance of the yacht to the full. Great staff, clean tables and good food. Free snacks with drinks. Amazing time.",5,2016,03,05
119,Just fabulous,"We spent a night here on 4th March dinner bed and breakfast deal.
I contacted the hotel before our stay and the staff were so friendly and helpful. We were allocated room 3044 which had a river view , stunning room. Only gripe was it was very warm inside and air con not working . We didn't report it until checkout so consequently had a warm night sleep . 
Very quite though so if heat wasn't an issue it would have been even better for comfort. 
We ate in the dining room and staff were very attentive, we had the best table with an uninterrupted  view up the Thames . The meal was outstanding the veal was perfect, thanks to the kitchen staff and chef ! A class ! Great place with lovely staff well done ! ",5,2016,03,05
119,great stay on lovely yacht,this yacht is moored right next to the excel which has good value parking £15.00 for 24hrs. Check in was quick and efficient all the staff were friendly. Our executive cabin was large and really well furnished-molten brown toiletories a nice touch. We ordered lunch which came to £40..00 with a soft drink not bad for London. Dinner in the restaurant was lovely great service and amazing food.A good nights sleep the cabin was quiet and in the morning a lovely self service breakfast. Check out again was quick . I would definitely return.,5,2016,03,05
119,Great venue! Amazing location too,"Smooth check in, great room, amazing facilities on the boat. Loved having lunch on the deck over looking the docks. 
We got upgraded to a dock side view right at the front of the boat and had amazing views of the planes taking off from London city airport.",5,2016,03,05
119,Stunning & Unique,"I stayed at the Sunborn London in March 2015 and would not hesitate to recommend it. Travelling by London Underground, it was a very short walk from Custom House station, and with the purpose of my stay being to attend the O2 Arena, the yacht is a couple of minutes away from the Emirates Cable Car.

Mr room was a Yacht Executive Riverview, beautifully appointed with nice touches such as the Tablet for use, and the view from the balcony especially at night was wonderful.

The staff I encountered were very good, and when arriving slightly earlier than planned there was no issue with early check-in. I also left an item behind and the Concierge returned it promptly without charge.

Overall it was an excellent stay.",5,2016,03,04
119,Amazing ,"We spent 3 nights at this beautiful hotel from Friday till monday, and I could not say one bad word about it. Friday evening we enjoyed a beautiful 3 course meal at their stunning restaurant where the service was impeccable the staff couldn't be faulted at all so professional. The reception team were very helpful and friendly with anything we needed. The bar is well set out and the staffs service was 10/10 and the cocktails were brilliant, we asked for things not on the menu and didn't hesitate to make what we asked for. 
The room was beautiful and spacious. 
Couldn't fault anything about this hotel.
A wonderful stay. 10/10 ",5,2016,03,03
119,'A really unique stay...',"The Sunborn makes a great first impression with a wonderfully opulent foyer. Check in was swift and efficient - staff were not overly friendly but got the job done.
Our room overlooked the dock, which was wonderful. The views from the boat are truly breathtaking and you get a very different experience of London from here. 
The room was well laid-out and felt luxurious and well-equipped. All the information on the hotel can be found on the room's tablet computer - a nice touch. We had to summon reception to get someone to address the screaming row that a couple in room 2008 were having at 1am (thanks for that 2008!) and they dealt with the situation promptly and professionally.
Breakfast the next day was delicious - really good-quality food and friendly and helpful waitresses.
I would (and have recommended) recommend the Sunborn to anyone based on the unique experience that is offers as a mini-break. It is a little gem and you do feel spoiled when you are aboard it. I will never forget the fabulous views of London from the deck of our room. A great experience.",4,2016,03,02
119,Whilst visiting Decleor!,We had a great stay at the Sunborn. Staying 2 nights whilst at Excell and an awards event. The trip was made easy being right next to excel. The food in the restaurant in the evening was superb. Will definately book again.  ,5,2016,03,02
119,Amazing,"I was lucky to live right next to this beautiful ship!! The staff are amazing however service is very slow in the bar I onnce waited 45 mins for a cocktail however what stunning food and location is amazing!!! 

I went ever weekend for a year and loved it to start my nights out!! 

And I stayed once if your a looking for the ritz experience but at premier inn prices this is the place",5,2016,03,01
119,All aboard.... ,"We chose to stay on the Sunborn Yacht Hotel for its location next to the London Excel show. In previous years it was located on the east side of Excel with allocated parking and accessibility for loading. This year located on the west you can't access close enough to unload bags and parking is away near the Crown Plaza which isn't discounted for customers. It was raining and the concierge did kindly trolley our luggage across the pedestrianised court yard in the rain, so the staff do try to assist. Maybe have a rain cover for your trolley?

The hotel was clean, tidy and staff were attentive. Room was a great size with a river view. Bed was comfortable and the bathroom amenities were Molton Brown (very nice). 

Down side was an empty mini bar, no wine glasses, missing little amenity details in the room like biscuits!! 

Bar had great views and comfortable seating but cocktails were average for the price (av.£12.50). You do get complimentary nuts!

Room service was fast and friendly.

Was a good stay but no real wow and accessibility for cars was frustrating.

119,"OH DEAR, AVOID ELEMIS SPA!!","Organisation is not Sunborn London's strong point.  I have visited it now on 3 occasions, once for afternoon tea in October 2015 which was fine, then I stayed in December 2015 and was allocated a dirty room with stained carpets and the view was rubbish in the water outside the room and latterly I have tried to make a booking for a spa facial treatment and afternoon tea for myself and a friend.  This proved to be beyond their capabilities as I requested a date and time, and was offered the date but completely different times and afternoon tea at 12.30pm!!!  I requested a facial and was offered a massage by mistake.  It takes them a day to reply to emails and there is no facility to speak with anyone on the phone to make a booking.  It now got up to 4 emails and no booking was in sight so I have chosen to go elsewhere.  Given that they market the hotel as 5* this is not in my opinion the service one would normally expect and Elemis Spa have let Sunborn down.",1,2016,03,01
119,Awesome.... apart from the pillows,"Fantastic and very unique hotel ideally situated for the Excel Convention Centre, where we were attending an exhibition.

The rooms are truly well appointed and the river view is special indeed. Breakfast is wonderful, the staff are super efficient and very friendly. 

The pillows are rock hard and plumped to at least 30cm in height. A trip to the Physio would have been in order had I have used them..... That's the only negative.

",4,2016,02,29
119,Bit of a gimmick but good hotel,"Except for the 'welcome on board' at check-in (which is a bit awkward through slow elevators) and the heavy swell-proof door in the bathroom you really wouldn't know you're on a boat.  Check-in was efficient, friendly staff.  Rooms are clean and have a lot of wood trimming giving it a luxurious feel.  Ideal for Excel and O2 if you want something different than the Novotels & Ibis's of this world.  Custom House DLR stop is 5 mins walk with Starbucks in the middle.",4,2016,02,29
119,Dinner Date,"Amazing setting on the Docklands Marina. 
The yacht itself was awesome - it's a shame there is very little activities to do in the evening. Example Singer, casino, entertainment etc.

We had dinner in the Lands End restaurant, using their Winter Menu. The restaurant and views over the Thames were quiet breath taking and excellent for couples, business meeting and family functions.
The dinner itself was mixed feeling, the starter was nice, nothing extra special. The wait for the next course took a while to come thru, maybe about 15-20 mins - and for a Sunday that's quite long.
When it did arrive the lamb ( Which I had) was cooked beautifully, however there was a strong taste of bitter and fireness... when I told the waitress, she took it back and returned saying that's how it's cooked. Nothing else.
Was not impressed with that single  dish costing £32.00.
The dessert and rest of the evening was very nice though.

Would I come back? Maybe for a drink in summer, or when Sunborn has a promotion, but not again soon.

119,Interesting alternative to a traditional hotel,"Ended up booking a room for a couple of nights owing to my usual choices being fully occupied.  I'd had my eye on this hotel in any event as I thought it was an interesting alternative to the traditional choices.
Arriving late in the evening feels a little odd because (if there's nothing on at the nearby Excel venue) it's so very quiet in and around the dock.  However, once on board, I appreciated the peace and quiet and the standard of the room and public areas, which are very nicely finished (to a standard better than a Royal Carribean cruise ship).
A drink in the bar overlooking the dock in the evening makes for a pleasant way to pass some time and very different to the usual hotel bars.
I'd definitely consider staying here again in the future, although probably more when I get the chance for leisure purposes in order to take it all in a little more.
Another plus - the friendly welcoming staff.",4,2016,02,29
119,Afternoon tea,"My wife and I visited tye sunborn for a birthday treat. A very unique experience.  Although the local area is rather barren. The view to the city is impressive
The service and tea very good, only a couple of minor snags . It would have been nice to have a fresh plate offered between the sandwiches and cakes,  also £6 for an extra pot of tea i thought quite expensive. 
Overall a very pleasant experinace and good value",5,2016,02,28
119,Amazing 1st year anaversary,Amazing hotel on the water with just the most magnificent views of the O2 arena and Isle of Dogs. Service was at the top of all the staffs list as nothing was to much trouble. The baby cot was broken I have to say was abit off putting bit the manager quickly fix the issue. A must book hotel on London.,5,2016,02,27
119,Anniversary,"We stayed here on our weekend anniversary whilst visiting the London Boat Show. Boat was busy, but staff were great and helpful. That evening we ate in the restaurant, food was impressive as was the breakfast the next day  Really enjoyed and stay and will do again.",5,2016,02,26
119,Wonderful experience,Myself and 3 friend arrived 24th Feb to go to The Brits at the O2. The reception staff are so friendly and helpful. Rooms are lovely with deep plush carpets and so quiet. The bar was nice and very relaxing. Had a lovely time and would have loved to have stayed longer. Will definately be going back again.,5,2016,02,25
119,Beautiful setting convent location ,Stayed here after visiting the excel. You can't get much closer so location was fantastic.  Welcome was warm and friendly. Room was lovely and views great. A little disappointed that there was no decaffeinated coffee in the room when I asked they seemed confused.and unable to help me. The bed was comfy and the in room iPad was useful. The restaurant  was lovely fine dining not overpriced for a London hotel.  Breakfast was very impressive with plenty of decaf!! Overall a lovely stay in a classy big yacht !,4,2016,02,25
119,"Great afternoon tea, rest was fake and pretentious!","Booked in JUN 2015 for FEB 2016, as a taster prior to booking the Sunborn Gibraltar (highly recommended by a friend who visits Gibraltar reg). Our 1st impression was good. We arrived early for the spa & afternoon tea. Vadim requested we complete the pre-check-in process whilst we waited to be escorted to the massage. It was rushed and the massage-OK. Sensed an atmosphere (disgruntled staff dispute) and we were left 'hanging' before being advised how to get back to reception. It was apparent there was no communication among staff; the receptionist told us to head upstairs for the a/tea but it wasn't opened yet. A member of the catering team did, however come back for us and the service- faultless!(Best part of our stay; TYVM!!). At 2.35PM, we tried to check-in and though we informed the female receptionist we had already completed the form and paid £40 pre-authorisation fee, she still gave me a form to complete. I reiterated myself and she informed us there was ""no room available yet"" despite witnessing her locate our booking and getting a key card ready!?! Whilst waiting, we observed another couple check-in and offered free drinks! Hoping for a smoother transaction, we approached Vadim (3PM) who first dealt with us. He seemed professional until we turned our backs and overheard him bragging, ""this is how it's done!""  Despite booking our room eight months hence and requested a quiet room, we were allocated Rm.1019, right by the loading drawbridge (for deliveries) ,nearest to the lifts and right by the engine! Further to this, there were stains on the carpet and the 2 singles beds joined together which left us with backaches in the morning from a noisy, sleepless night!  Our decision to bypass dinner at the Sunborn and to venture out to the O2 on the Cable car helped salvaged a disappointing birthday, prearranged at the Sunborn!
P.S. Contrary to the website photos, there is no bath robes for guests staying in a classic room!",3,2016,02,25
119,Excellent stay ,"Stayed here for 1 night for event at the O2. 

Easy to get to from DLR, short wait for am available room but had a drink tin the very pleasant bar whilst we waited. Maryiam on reception could not have been more friendly helpful and welcoming. 

Room lovely, very clean and good size. Complimentary ipad a nice touch. 

Breakfast very good. ",5,2016,02,25
119,The cruise that isn't a cruise - pure luxury!,"What an amazing experience! I have never been on a cruise but it felt just like boarding a boat to travel somewhere exotic! The welcome was exceptional, the room luxurious and the whole atmosphere quite delectable. We stayed there for 1 night only but wish that it had been for a little longer. It was an ideal location for the O2 but that meant we didn't have enough time on board! 

We will definitely be returning and I am continually looking for an excuse to go back. I cannot speak more highly about it for a unique stay in busy London - just lovely.

Apparently they can accommodate a private dining party and we are seriously considering that as a venue for a family occasion.",5,2016,02,24
119,Lovely stay for our anniversary,"The hotel is very elegant and up market a perfect stay for an anniversary celebration for the night. We were paying for the night in cash however just be aware, like with most hotels they will put the whole charge of the room and i think £40 extra for any breakages to your original booking credit card as a holding charge. the amount was returned to the card after about 5 days 

Room was lovely, we had the executive suite with balcony river view. not much to see to be honest from our room just houses from the other side of the dock. a bit disappointing with the bed, was advertised as a king bed but it was actually just two large single beds pushed together, which considering for the price to stay here is a little disappointing.

Bathroom was lovely and the shower was nice and spacious, much bigger than usually found within a hotel on land. Whilst inside your room / bathroom you would never know that your actually on a yacht, very sturdy with no movement whatsoever

The hand written note left in our room upon check in, congratulating us for our anniversary was a lovely touch and really made the stay feel more personal 

Check out was at 12pm so we had a nice lie in before leaving. Didn't bother with breakfast here as it is £20 on a weekday morning and £13 on a weekend. There is a Café across the road and also a Tesco express  

Lovely hotel and a great stay for an anniversary treat",4,2016,02,23
119,Wow. Just wow,"What can I say? What a great idea for a hotel.
Arrived having booked a standard dockside room and found we had been upgraded to an exec room, with balcony and what a view. The room was fabulous and the info on the tablet brilliant. Upon check out we said how pleased we were and asked if there were others? There's one in Gibraltar. It's now on our bucket list. Will stay again. Thank you",5,2016,02,22
119,The Staff...The Room...The Experience....Whats not to like?,"As a surprise for my parents we booked The Sunborn  for a nights accommodation prior to an 02 concert.
First thing to say is the Sunborn is in the perfect location for such an event. Using the Emirates Air line (at £3.80 p/p) is only a couple of hundred yards away and takes you across the Thames right next to the 02. (a great experience in itself)
That aside you can use this hotel purely as an experience, a treat, you wont be disappointed...we weren't.
The price of the rooms do vary and offer slightly different levels of prestige. so check before you book. (Classic room, Executive room, dockside, riverside etc.) But do not in any way be put off by booking the cheapest room. We booked a riverside (but not too expensive) and were still very impressed. (see photos) However splash out if you want. 
Food and drink are priced relative to the venue. Apparently there are other cheaper restaurants in the area but we
decided to embrace the experience and used the lounge bar for drinks and the main restaurant for food.(there is a set menu & a La Carte menu. We all had Steak........to die for.... Honestly..Food & Staff equally fantastic.
We will re-visit.
",5,2016,02,22
119,1 Night Stay,"Definitely has the wow factor when you walk onto the yacht. Vadim on reception is very professional and extremely helpful. We had one of the 2 suites which had a jacuzzi and a sauna in, really lovely room! Drinks and food are overpriced in my opinion, we arrived an hour earlier than the strict check of 3 o clock so we had 2 small glasses of house wine and a Ham sandwich which cost £32. We are in the Restsurant, good was nice and staff were great. Lovely stay! ",4,2016,02,22
119,Valentines Day,"5 stars as the rooms are of top quality in great location and unique and romantic

its expensive and so is bar and breakfast but you get what you pay for and this is one of them must do things

the main thing for me is the bed is the best bed ive ever slept on so cumfy ",5,2016,02,22
119,Wow!,"A truly wonderful experience. I recently stayed here with my husband and our 2 young children in a luxury family room with balcony overlooking the Royal Victoria Docklands, Canary Wharf and the 02 Arena. Our children loved it here too, they enjoyed the free ipad and a big tv with kids channels in the room and food from a kids menu. We dined at Lands End restaurant with great views of London and chose delicious cuisine from an a la carte menu. I was quite overwhelmed by it all to say the least. It has a 4+ rating but looks and feels like 5+ The staff are very friendly and helpful indeed. We visited the cocktail bar and got treated like royalty by Alex and Luigi, the bottle spinning cocktail specialists. I recommend seeing a sunrise and a sunset on top deck. We look forward to going back and recommend to all. 
Thank you Sunborn.",5,2016,02,22
119,Groupon visit weeknight,"Lovely yacht hotel. Lots of soarkly shiny surfaces making it all feel a bit glam. We ate in the restaurant for a very late evening meal. The food was a fairly decent higher end effort. The service was excellent and cannot be faulted.
Drinks were quite expensive in the bar but there was a nice view of the dock.
The room was spacious, clean and comfortable. A good sized balcony and there were very good mirrors everywhere in the room! Great shower with lots of space.
Substantial breakfast brought directly to the room upon request.
Short walk to the DLR, reasonably priced car park 2 mins away (we paid £15 for 24 hours).
Would def stay again!",4,2016,02,22
119,birthday suprise,"This was a surprise for my partner - had tickets to classic car show and stumbled across this beauty by accident.  Staff very helpful & attentive.  Booked room with river view however as had mentioned in emails it was a birthday treat received an upgrade to a room with a balcony and 25% voucher off drink and to check out at 1pm. Superb views.  

Breakfast is wonderful and cannot fault this place......was very reluctant to leave!!!!!!",5,2016,02,22
119,Mainly positive,"This really is a beautiful hotel. The setting, the interior, the spacious rooms (we had one with a balcony overlooking the water), the cleanliness, the friendly reception and housekeeping staff - all excellent. So why one mark off - noise. Our first two nights aboard passed without incident but our last night was marred by doors banging, talking, yelling, swearing which came and went throughout the evening. After drifting in and out of sleep listening to all this, the final straw came at 3.48 a.m. with loud music, blasting out. I went out on to the balcony and knew immediately that it was coming from the room next to us. Upon phoning reception to complain, it took about another 20/25 minutes for things to quieten down. When spending around £300.00 for a Saturday night stay, this is not acceptable. We were on the boat for a special occasion and although the hotel can't primarily be held responsible for the noise of some guests they do have a duty of care to put a stop to it should it get out of hand and they just took too long in this instance. Would I go back ? Actually yes, I would as were just unlucky with our third night but the hotel needs to take all guests well being into account and not let those who are clearly out to party have their fun looked after. .",4,2016,02,21
119,A unique hotel experience,"I booked this hotel due to the unique experience it offers; a chance to sleep in a super yacht, yet you are close to the city. We arrived at the nearest tube stop (Custom House) and headed to the hotel. It's an impressive sight to see it docked. It's located very near to Excel, and it would also be a good choice if you are visiting the O2.

The staff were extremely professional at check-in, and throughout the hotel they were all very friendly. 

We stayed in a river-view room, which gave a great view of the O2 and Canary Wharf from the balcony. The room was very nice and clean, spacious and well equipped. There was a tablet in the room, with lots of useful information on it. The bathroom was good, with an acceptable shower, and Molton Brown toiletries.

If you want to eat at the hotel, then I would advise reserving a table well before your stay. The restaurant was full the night we stayed.

I would highly recommend this hotel if you would like a unique experience in London. The location is a little out of the city, but if you are happy enough to sit on the tube for a few minutes, then it really is a great choice.",4,2016,02,21
119,Valentine's Day stay.,"My fiancée and I stayed in this super luxury yacht hotel from 14th-15th Feb and it was absolutely amazing! The staff were extremely helpful and polite, we cannot fault the service or the hotel, the hotel was clean & was maintained constantly by maids which was nice to see. We stayed in an executive room which we think is the muts nuts, the bed was the most comfiest we've slept on by far, very professional hotel and staff. We will definitely be coming back! 

A+++++++++++*************",5,2016,02,21
119,LOVED THE LUXURY,"We had a lovely weekend here.  The room was beautiful, roomy and clean (superking bed).  The location quiet.  The staff exceptionally helpful.  Breakfast was well worth the money.  It made a change from the norm.  The rooms seemed to be very well insulated as I didn't hear a peep all night long.",5,2016,02,21
119,Exceptional,"We booked to stay here at short notice as we were visiting an event at ExCel. We do like something a bit different so this was right up our street. It was as luxurious as their website described. 
We parked at the multi story opposite which was £15 a day. Taking into account this and the room price, it was still cheaper than the hotels in the area but worth so much more.
On arrival we were checked in very quickly and went to our room. All I can say is Wow. We only had a basic King Size room but it exceeded our expectations. It was extremely clean and comfortable and larger than any other hotel room I have stayed in (including The Shard). The bed was just the right firmness and had different pillows to choose from.The bathroom was spotless and the shower was very powerful and kept a constant temperature. 
We hadn't booked a table at the restaurant and they were fully booked so we decided to eat in the bar. They had a good selection of nibbles and small dishes/club sandwiches etc or a nice selection of burgers which we decided on along with a bottle of Champagne. The staff could not be more attentive especially Teodora and Katarina and the barman Alex. They were extremely busy at one point but did get to is as quickly as possible and were extremely apologetic. The food was good value for money and we stayed in the bar all evening.
After an extremely good nights sleep, with no noise to disturb us, we decided to have Breakfast although it wasn't included in the price. It was £12 to eat in the restaurant or £19 to have it delivered to the room. We ate in the restaurant and it was worth every penny. The views were stunning and the tables were positioned well to take advantage of this. It was your usual buffet style affair with fresh pastries and fruit as well as the full english. We decided to have the full breakfast and these was lots available and very hot, the herbed mushrooms were amazing. The staff were very quick and discreet even when having to deal with a loud spoken gentleman who's card wouldn't work.
Overall exceptional. Something a little different but with lots of luxury. The drinks weren't cheap and our bar bill cost more than the room, but we would do it all again and were reluctant to check out.",5,2016,02,21
119,Something Different,"Stayed at Sunborn London for a birthday surprise for two nights in February and it certainly delivers. The Yacht is most impressive in its mooring next to the Excel exhibition centre.and it feels that bit special from the moment you arrive. There is no parking or access to the yacht by car to unload ( apart form disabled access ) so be prepared for a short walk. We parked in the excel multi story for a very reasonable flat charge of £15 per 24 hours.

Once you are on board the reception area is again very impressive with a staircase leading you though  an atrium to the upper floors ( or decks )

We had a standard dock facing room which for the cost was very spacious and well equipped. The bathroom with a shower, loo and basin, was small but perfectly formed and had everything needed. The bedroom was in two sections, the first with a very comfortable 6 foot bed and the second part with a seating area with a sofa TV mini bar tea making etc. The room had a luxurious feel to it and felt like very good value for money. We has dinner in the restaurant on the first evening and had a window table with great views across to Canary Wharf and Docklands. We had the set menu, which at £32 for three courses was expensive for the food we received. It was all ok but nothing really that special for the cost. A bottle of Prosecco was £40. It was also quite annoying having to listen to a man  talking loudly in to his mobile for most of the time we were there. This really should be discouraged by the restaurant staff. 

All of the staff we met were polite and professional and provided great service. We didn't have breakfast on the yacht based on our dinner experience, and at £19 felt this was quite expensive.

As it was February we didn't get to experience the outdoor deck areas in the restaurant and bar, which I'm sure in good weather are a great location for a meal or a drink.

There are lots of other cafes and restaurants nearby so there is plenty of choice for eating and drinking within a short walk.

Overall this was a great experience and certainly something that's a little bit different. The accommodation represents really good value for money but I don't feel that the restaurant provided the quality for the prices charged. I would certainly go back and reccomend this as a place to stay in London, especially if you are looking fr something a bit different.",4,2016,02,20
119,GROUPON VOUCHER,"I treated my wife to a night on the Sunborn in Feb 2016.
We arrived at the dock, and the yacht is truly impressive. The staff were courteous and attentive. The hotel clean and impeccable. There was a letdown over the room. Instead of panoramic views over to Canary Wharf and the O2, we were tucked away with our view being one of the now dis-used dock cranes, rising out of the concrete like one of the machines from war of the worlds.
I asked for an alternative, but was told that these were the rooms allocated for Groupon clients.
The dining room that evening was well staffed with attentive waitresses and waiters. Disapointment no two came when my wife wanted to order the lamb shoulder. A £5.00 surcharge would be levied, due to the limitations of our £199.00 Groupon Voucher.
Great place, but next time, I shall not use Groupon. I can't imagine the the price would have been much more booked direct.
Lovely hotel. ",4,2016,02,20
119,Lovely weekend away.,"A fantastic idea. The sunborn is lovely. All the rooms are a fab size and you could easily stay for a few nights. Looks beautiful inside and out and with good weather the deck would be lovely. The reception welcome was perfect. The only let down was the bar and food service, decent food albeit a little bit slow. 

A must stay if you are this side of London. Its a good 40 mins into central London on the DLR and tube but get an Uber back, costs about £20!",4,2016,02,19
119,Loved it,This is the second time we stayed onboard. Both times we have been on coach trip so did not expect to get such great rooms. All staff were friendly and a great choice for breakfast. Rooms very spacious and clean. Only gripe is when a coach party is booking in trying to get on a lift can be a yo-yo affair. This could be solved by having a member of staff giving out key cards on the coach or using 1 lift for reception and the other to get to rooms when booking in a coach party. I felt sorry for other guests caught up in our arrival. Will be looking to book independently later in the year for a longer stay.,5,2016,02,19
119,Massage and Afternoon Tea - Groupon Deal,"My friend purchased an afternoon tea and massage voucher through Groupon for £65 each. Visually stunning and modern exterior, lots of fab photo opportunities at this hotel. Lovely massage on the 18th Feb 2016, both spa ladies where very warm and welcoming. We decided we needed to move the tea time and the lovely spa lady called up and handled this for us. We where given front row seats for tea overlooking the 02 and the relaxing water, which was lovely as my friend and I had lots of chatting to do! As a vege great to have a choice of 2 sandwiches the tomato version was delicious. Lovely little scones and desserts where pretty cute too. I liked that no staff hovered (like they do at some tea places), we felt nice and relaxed. I defo think the afternoon tea at £22 is worth that price. Great service throughout this hotel, I was on a crutch and the staff where so sweet and accommodating. Not too keen on groupon deals as have had less than favorable experiences with them in the past, I felt this was was good value though and a novelty factor to be on a swish yacht. Would recommend and would return.",5,2016,02,19
119,Amazing stay!,"Special thanks to Lorans who was very helpful during our stay. The hotel itself is stuning, had booked Yacht river room with beautiful astonishing view.. had dinner on board which was beautifully presented and was very amazingly tasty! Check out was simple and easy, Lorans stored our luagages and we went to Cable airlines must try if you are in the area! Overall experience was great! 

Thank you Sunborn will book again for our anniversary.",5,2016,02,18
119,Don't waste your time!,"We went here for my birthday celebration with the family. We were attending a show at ExCel and thought it would be good to try something nearby and different, as opposed to the usual 5* hotels. 

The size of the room was okay and cleanliness just about acceptable. Nothing else to say!

Then we went to dinner. The service is not geared for a nearly-full restaurant. After we ordered, we had to wait forever for our starters, for the bread, for the water, for the drinks and so on. Then when we got the starters I had to send mine back as they got it wrong. Then we had to wait another age until the main courses came. Again, I had to return mine as they got it wrong! The worst part, my young son who didn't order a starter, had to wait nearly 2 hours to get his main course. As he hadn't ordered a starter, he was starving. They should have brought his main course with our starters. 

The service was friendly but extremely amateur and naive. It's been said before about places like this but they are trading on their location and views. 

This could be a very nice place for O2 and ExCel but on this showing we will not be coming back or recommending it to our friends. 

",1,2016,02,18
119,Birthday stay,I booked a one night stay on groupon for my husbands birthday. It was a amazing experience from start to finish. The room was so big the views over the Thames was great. Worth the upgrade. The restaurant in the evening with the outstanding food and service added to the evening a special thank you to Edgar from Portugal first class. The buffet breakfast was plentiful one of the best porridges l have had. Will definitely be back,5,2016,02,18
119,Spot on and great night's sleep,"Conveniently located near to the Excel centre and a couple of minutes walk from the DLR the yacht is prominent in the docks as you walk through. With disused and mothballed derricks either side it really looks ready to go, despite being permanently moored. I arrived early and Meri on reception kindly checked me in and placed my bag in storage so it would be ready in my room for later. 
Excellent and friendly staff both in facilities and in front of house. I had a lovely sleep in a very comfortable bed with a water view. Buffet breakfast with good quality sausages and bacon. Coffee was brought swiftly to the table and I was pleasantly surprised by the glass for juice being a decent size, not the normal thimbles! 
I would happily recommend a stay here.",5,2016,02,18
119,Great for a special treat,"Excellent service from the staff, especially Vadim? On reception who ensured  I could check in early to surprise my husband on Valentine's Day. 
Lovely room, great view of dock at sunset enjoying cocktails, pity breakfast was so expensive as would have lined to have finished off our trip with a nice breakfast looking out on the river.

Would recommend if you can get a good deal on the rooms. A little expensive Maine for a normal night away.",4,2016,02,17
119,Another great stay,"Booked an over night stay as my husband and I were meeting friends in London. The customer service from staff was excellent, the accommodation first class and the breakfast was great too all with the view of the Thames. This is our fourth stay and have no complaints at all. Will definitely be returning again.",5,2016,02,17
119,Location is the issue,"The yacht is beautiful both inside and out. Vadim on Reception was outstandingly kind and charming and, probably because there were very few bookings when we stayed, he gave us an upgraded room.  It was enormous and extremely comfortable, and also immaculate.

The location has the benefit of being very quiet, though I imagine this can be different when the ExCel centre is busy and there are consequently many more guests.  On the other hand, it is not especially convenient unless this is the part of London you specifically want to visit.  The key Tube lines are the Jubilee and the Docklands Light Railway.  Despite Royal Victoria looking like the closest station on some maps, Custom House is actually nearer. To reach the yacht you simply follow signs to, and through, the ExCel Centre - but a notice here and there to indicate which way to go to find 'Sunborn' would be helpful!

We ate an evening meal with our family and, with pre-dinner drinks and wine with the meal, it was a fairly expensive affair working out at about £70 per head. That's okay if the food is exceptionally good, and by those standards I would say it was only average value for that price. Service was good - but I requested an additional vegetable, which got forgotten.

Breakfast costs are also quite high; again, if you choose to eat a cooked breakfast, this is not unreasonable but someone who is only really looking for some fresh fruit and a slice of toast may feel it rather expensive.  

To summarise, it was a very enjoyable and 'different' experience and I would encourage others to give it a go for that reason alone, but I don't think it will become one of our regular favourites.",4,2016,02,17
119,Excellent ,"My Aunt took us for an afternoon on the Sunbourn yacht to celebrate her 80th birthday. 
Everything is of quality on board right down to the very last detail. We will certainly return. Excellent staff.
If this review has been helpful please tick the box below as I value your feedback. ",5,2016,02,17
119,Kept waiting,"We stayed here last night and booked a table for dinner it took 35mind for us to get someone to take our drinks order and then the food came before the water, 3 tables came in after us but served before all were offered bread not us, the room was ok but the service was just terrible, left feeling very disappointed, and lastly don't travel by car plenty of parking but a nightmare to get to.",1,2016,02,16
119,Night at the Sunborn,"The hotel is brilliant, the staff are extremely helpful and attentive and can't do enough to assist. The cabins are extremely spacious and well equipped and the bed is very large and comfortable. We had an afternoon tea which was great. Didn't eat there in the evening or have breakfast so I cannot comment on these although I would expect them to be of a very high standard. We also had a treatment in the spa which was very relaxing. The check out time is mid day which means you can have a lie in which is better than some, where the check out is much earlier.",5,2016,02,16
119,Valentine Weekend in luxury ,Booked through Secret Escapes & this should not be kept a secret! Have also stayed at Sunborn Gibraltar which was just as impressive. A unique experience & even if your dock side you still view the water. Service is good and the experience top rated.,5,2016,02,14
119,"Great surroundings, service needs improving","The interiors are stunning and even the basic room was very spacious and well appointed. However, the restaurant and bar service falls somewhat short of the mark. I thought it may have been a one off in the, far from crowded, bar when our waiter “forgot” our drinks order unfortunately, not so. Arriving for breakfast the next morning 20 minutes before closing time we were greeted with a cold stare while the waitress pointedly consulted her watch. So rude that I asked her if there was a problem, to which she mumbled “No”. Then coffee arrived with no milk. We had to ask about the extras available and half the serving dishes for the buffet breakfast were empty, and we were not the only ones asking that some more food be provided, which eventually, grudgingly it was. Overall a great experience for the surroundings and the night time views slightly marred by poor service. On the whole I would still recommend it.",3,2016,02,14
119,Excellent overnight stay,"Stayed overnight on a Groupon deal. Really great value, had a stunning executive room with a balcony overlooking the river.
We arrived early but the lovely lady on reception checked in our luggage and assured us it would be in the room when we came back. It certainly was including a bottle of red wine and 2 glasses!
The staff at this hotel are exceptional and should really be congratulated as they make you feel like a VIP.
The rooms are large and very clean. Plenty of storage space, 2 bottles of water and tea and coffee. Lovely towels, flannels, bathrobes and slippers and hot water. Free WiFi, password is your surname and room number. One tip is to bring a European plug adapter with you if you have a lot of things that need plugs as its half and half sockets in the room.
Really enjoyed sitting at the bar in the evening and the restaurant in the morning overlooking the sights.Breakfast was amazing.
We enjoyed the cable car over to the 02, loads of bars and restaurants here. Had a meal in the evening at Las Iguanas.
The following morning we caught the DLR to go and see St Paul's and Tower of London, £9 each return. Custom house station right opposite.
Paid £15 to park at the Excel, just a tip exit from the West of the venue and the Sunborn will be right in front of you.
Just a couple of small niggles, the cooked breakfast selection could have been a little hotter and perhaps ask for a top floor room as we could hear people walking above us, kept me awake briefly.
Please feel free to ask any questions!",5,2016,02,13
119,Simply fabulous!,"I booked this as a surprise for my wife's special birthday, not having seeing it in person, I was a bit apprehensive but followed the reviews on Trip Advisor and teading between the lines I decided to go ahead.

What can I say, from the moment we arrived we felt at home. We were greeted by Mariam who welcomed us with a huge smile. I reminded her it was my wife special birthday with a smile she handed me the key to our room.

Well, when we walked in we were so impressed with our room. It was large with views over the river, very romantic. 

We booked in for dinner and that was simply devine scallops as a starter followed by their lamb, all I can say is if you do stay here, dinner is not to be missed!

Then next morning we had their breakfast which is a buffet, although you are asked if you want poached, fried or an omelette made to order.

On closing all I can say is a big  thank you to the entire team and I have taken a card to personally write to the management whom I believe is Andrea if I'm not mistaken to congratulate him on creating such a great team.

My next visit, if Andrea can get me a deal will be their sister hotel in Gibralter.",5,2016,02,13
119,Great time and relaxing,"The service and staff was very good and welcoming the staff could not do enough for us and made my time on the boat even better,
The rooms are nice and big very clean big bed all you need in the room, 
Loved that my room had a balcony and was nice to sit out there",5,2016,02,12
119,Wifes Birthday retreat ..,"Stayed here for 2 nights in the river view executive suite for my wifes Birthday, absolutely fantastic, good quality 3 course dinner on the night and a lovely buffet breakfast in the morning, friendly staff that are all happy to help, they even put up banners, balloons and a birthday cake in our room for when we arrived to surprise the wife! cant recommend this place enough",5,2016,02,11
119,Birthday celebration,"Highly recommend staying here not only for access to London but as something different to a normal hotel, we were celebrating my boyfriends birthday got the deal on secret escapes and breakfast and dinner was included in the price, 
We were up graded to a executive suite whic was a lovely surprise, the room was gorgeous with a huge balcony, 
The restaurant was lovely both for dinner and breakfast highly recommend a visit.",5,2016,02,11
119,Sunday Lunch experience,Recently had Sunday lunch on board no one else in the restaurant until later when afternoon teas were being served.  Very quiet with no piped music lacking atmosphere.  Small portions of food.  Would not try again.,3,2016,02,10
119,Managers meeting yearly Conference,We have had our yearly Conference on the Sunborn on the 8th Feb and what a place to hold it the service was spot on from when i walked in and when i we was leaving very helpful staff and the food was amazing and credit to the chef and team that made it a really smooth day my staff had a wonderful time and we will be back,5,2016,02,10
119,Excellent location for O2 and Excel,Spent one night 'on board' this fabulous hotel and was really impressed with the room size and facilities.  The staff were all very friendly and the food was delicious for dinner and breakfast.  Am now considering booking again when visiting the O2 in April due to the handy location via Emirates cable car!,5,2016,02,09
119,Perfect Stay!,"My husband and I have just returned from a two-night stay on the Sunborn Yacht Hotel which was a celebration for my special birthday. Check-in was swift and straight forward and it was explained that the cabin key card is used to operate the lift and for access to the cabin corridor. Our room was warm, clean, spacious and river facing with the most comfortable, enormous bed and good lighting. We were more than happy with the bathroom which had a good sized shower, large white fluffy towels and Molton Brown toiletries. The bar was very relaxing with fantastic views of the London skyline, pleasant music and attentive bar staff. Unfortunately, we suffered the effects of Storm Imogen during our stay and so we weren't able to venture outside on deck but this would be lovely on light summer evenings. The most surprising thing, being in the heart of London, was the quietness of the place at night both from outside influences and consideration of other guests. A good trip, if you have time, would be to take the Emirates Cable Car (nearby) across to the south side of the river and then take a boat to one of the piers in central London. We really enjoyed our time on the Sunborn, all the staff were lovely and seemed to get the balance just right between being friendly and professional - well done everyone!",5,2016,02,09
119,40th Birthday Celebration,"We stayed one night as a party of 14 friends and family.

The hotel looks stunning - a cruise yacht moored in the dock. It is in reality a purpose built hotel with excellent views of the O2 and the Emirates Skyline cable cars.

Our room was very spacious with a very comfortable king-size bed, coffee/tea maker, water, a/c and free wifi.  The bathroom was also spacious with all amenities.  We had a view of the dockside from the large window.  In all, very comfortable.

The bar is attractive with windows and doors leading on to the terrace, which give lovely views toward the O2.  The drinks, although doubles, are expensive but then most good class London hotels are similar.

We had the fixed price 3 course dinner, which gave several choices for each course.  All the food was well presented and tasty.  The breakfast was buffet service and probably the best hotel buffet breakfast I have had for it's quality and taste.

There was a mix-up with our party's time for dinner.  Instead of 8pm, the hotel could  not accommodate us until 9:30pm.  As an apology the manager gave us free drinks before dinner and free breakfast.  

During our stay we went sight seeing by tube using the Custom House station just a couple of minutes away from the hotel.  A small tip, either get an Oyster Card for your London travel or use a contactless bank card as we did.  It was so much easier than queuing for tickets.

An excellent short stay.",5,2016,02,08
119,Great Stay,"Stayed here last weekend for the night and the stay was lovely. The room was clean and had everything you needed. We had the executive room and although the room itself was huge the bathoom wasn't massive but what do you expect on a yacht hotel? The rooms aren't built to have massive bathrooms. We went down to the bar for some drinks and it was quiet but a lovely chilled atmosphere. The staff were all lovely and suggested cocktails for us. We didn't have dinner there as we wanted to go and explore what was local. There wasn't much but a lovely restaurant about a 50 yard walk away that was Spanish. The room was quiet and we slept like babies! 

Breakfast was also lovely, although my only criticism was we had to ask for coffee and butter a few times but they were very busy so it can't be helped. It didn't bother us as we had plenty of time. 

Overall our stay was lovely and we will be staying again-next time though maybe in summer as feb was a tad too cold to wander anywhere!",5,2016,02,08
119,"Great hotel, highly recommended",A lovely clean hotel. Great location for O2. Staff very friendly and helpful. Hotel location is very quiet no noisy sirens like most of London. Great choice of breakfast too. If going to O2 try to use Emirates Skyline. Makes it a really easy journey across river.,5,2016,02,07
119,Sunborn Yacht Hotel,"We have just got back from a lovely birthday weekend on the Sunborn Yacht Hotel the whole experience was excellent from arriving on board to the service and food we were looked after for the whole of the weekend,",5,2016,02,07
119,Great Weekend!,This was a Birthday surprise I had the most amazing weekend. This place is a must to visit breakfast was hot and delicious and the views were amazing. We also requested a late checkout which wasn't a problem at all. All staff were friendly and willing to help with any queries we had. We will be returning again soon. ,5,2016,02,03
119,A fantastic stay onboard a fantastic boat!,"My boyfriend and I stayed on Sunborn London on Sunday 10th January after attending the Movie Club being held onboard that afternoon. Upon arriving at the Sunborn yacht we were warmly welcomed and quickly checked in to our Yacht Executive Room overlooking the river. The room was very spacious and comfortable and we could enjoy the sights of London from our balcony.

Following the movie, we both really enjoyed our three course dinner in the Land’s End Restaurant and were impressed with the attentive service. The food was excellent and we enjoyed a table with great reviews across to The O2 and the Emirates Skyline.

Following a great night’s sleep in the large and very comfortable bed we greatly enjoyed a leisurely buffet breakfast before leaving to enjoy a day in the city. There was a great amount of choice for breakfast and I particularly enjoyed the smoked salmon and scrambled eggs!

I’d definitely recommend Sunborn London as a fantastic destination for an overnight stay or mini-break – it’s easily reached by either the DLR, or the tube to North Greenwich and then the Emirates Skyline – a great way to arrive in style! It’s only a 5 minute walk to the Emirates terminal and there are lots of restaurants and a Tesco Express nearby, plus it’s ideal for visiting exhibitions at the Excel Centre next door or seeing a show at The O2.

Many thanks for a great stay!",5,2016,02,03
119,Disappointing view!,"I booked to stay on board the Sunborn as a special surprise treat for my partner on Christmas Eve. I have to say that the whole experience was somewhat disappointing and not what I had expected. The yacht is very impressive as you arrive but you cannot drive up to it and have to park about 10-15 minutes walk away in a public multi-story car park which is a bit of a pain. When we checked in, although our room was spacious and very nice, we were very disappointed to find that our view out of the window was of a wall and of lots of filthy rubbish floating on the water! They barely had any customers staying on the yacht that night and, yet, knowing it was Christmas Eve and a special evening, the Sunborn didn't bother to try to make our stay nice by giving us a nice view on the other side of the ship despite having many empty rooms!! Our friends, who checked in at the same time, did luckily get a room with a view on the other side and this was really impressive but we were left feeling like the 'poor relations'. When I spoke to the receptionist about this matter, she advised me that the manager would be in touch to discuss this matter and I haven't heard anything since and it's now over a month later!! This says a lot to me about customer service on board the Sunborn!! That evening we had booked into the restaurant on the yacht and were looking forward to a nice Christmas Eve dinner. There were not many guests and so not much of an atmosphere and this was made worse by the fact that our food arrived stone cold and we all had to send it back!! Three of us ordered the festive Turkey dinner and one of us a fish dish but the food was completely cold when we received it and we had to send it back and then wait quite a long time before we received new, warm food - which really took the edge off the meal as my appetite had past by the time it all came back again! I was very surprised that this had happened as it wasn't as though the kitchen staff were rushed off their feet with guests!!!!! We didn't even bother going to the bar that evening as it was SO quiet with no entertainment nor atmosphere at all - it really didn't feel like Christmas!! The next morning we had a nice breakfast (I can really recommend the hot chocolate) and then checked out and left pretty quickly as it really lacked atmosphere and didn't feel at all like Christmas Day or the least bit special!!! Very disappointing!! The staff seemed more interested in getting ready for their lunch covers that day rather than wishing us guests a 'happy Christmas'. ",2,2016,02,01
119,Great Weekend,"Arrived at 'the Yacht' for a long weekend. Reception and staff 100%. We had a lovely suite and everything top notch with one small exception. Bean counters in evidence:
towels in two's, 2 hand 2 bath etc. espresso machine 2 capsules of coffee each. No finishing touches: flowers, turn down service; chocs on pillow. However, a nice weekend, the food on board delightful and not over expensive. One for the list if staying in London and recommended whole heartedly.",5,2016,02,01
119,An experience with a twist !,"We spent a night whilst in London to see a show whilst staying at  this venue. It was a Christmas present from my lady ! The cabin was large with a small outside balcony  and a super king size bed and en suite shower room .All spick and span but the room fridge was totally empty not even a bottle of water, and tea/coffee facility was very limited. Lacked the true ambiance of a cruise ship !

The breakfast was not included in the room price,, but was none the less provided a great choice   . The directions  to the hotel need to be more comprehensive for those using the Docklands Light Railway to access .together with an accurate map and to exit at Customs House",4,2016,02,01
119,For a Special Occasion,"We stayed at the Sunborn Hotel over night for our 25th Wedding Anniversary. The king size room with river view was comfortable and spacious with all the usual amenities. 
The restaurant was fine dining, good food and although pricey, nice for a special occasion. 
Ideally situated for ExCel and the O2",4,2016,01,30
119,"Brilliant, thank you!","Such a lovely place with lovely staff. We loved our stay and upgrade. Evening drinks and food great, breakfast delicious! Would definitely recommend and would stay again. Bit of a journey into the city centre via DLR but not too much of an issue. The evening view overlooking Canary Wharf was brilliant.",5,2016,01,30
119,Christmas getaway break,"Great hotel in a fabulous position, our stay was brought for us as part of a theatre package for my wife's birthday, we loved our stay at Sunborn London and can't way to return in August. Great breakfast as well in the Restaurant overlooking the vista of central London and river. Our room was ample in size and well appointed with a fabulous waterside view, I highly recommend this hotel with great transport links into central London and easy access to the cable car over the river to the Dome!  ",5,2016,01,30
119,Amazing!!!!!,"Was totally amazing from start to finish. The staff was so attentive and room very large with a lovely bathroom.
The tube is only five mins walk away which was so handy as your a little way out from the city centre. 
Would I stay again....hell yes!!!!
",5,2016,01,30
119,Afternoon tea ,"Absolute fab afternoon tea spectacular views lovely service and great value. 
Staff were lovely and very accommodating. Absolutely stunning surroundings. 
The hotel itself was easy to find and great transport links. 
Throughly enjoyable and affordable treat for me and my friend  ",5,2016,01,28
119,Luxury Hotel with a difference,"We stayed for 2 nights on board this luxury Yacht which offered top quality accommodation with outstanding service.
The room was large and extremely comfortable with all the amenities you would expect from a quality hotel. The food was extremely good and the bar area offered comfortable seating in a relaxing atmosphere and a superb view over Canary Wharf.
Highly recommended !",5,2016,01,27
119,Phil Hall Room 3028 22/01/16,"We stayed here for my wife's 60th birthday, the best place we could have chosen. Mari on reception was very polite and efficient.
The whole yacht was immaculately clean and luxurious. All the staff were extremely polite and helpful. Views from the bar and restaurants are unbelievable as was the view from the luxurious room.
I would recommend to any body a truly unbelievable experience and a superb location.
Many thanks for making my wife's birthday an unforgettable experience.",5,2016,01,27
119,resonating hum drove us CRAZY,"Nice place and good rooms - but didn't sleep a wink as the air con/ fan system used on board hums ALL NIGHT with an irritating, penetrating resonance! I have no idea if other people have noticed this, but it's awful. Perhaps they should change or fix their system? I honestly have no idea what it could be and staff I mentioned this to also had no idea. A generator perhaps? If so, just switch the darn thing off after10pm and problem would be solved!",2,2016,01,26
119,Affordable luxury ,"Such a wonderful stay. Staff are friendly and helpful, had a small wait in reception but with put complaints upgraded us to a balcony room. The bathroom was well equipped and with heated bathroom floors, wonderfully spacious room, great facilities and room service. Room has a good interactive tablet to help you with hotel facilities. Lovely Spa.  Would highly recommend. ",5,2016,01,26
119,Week end celebration,"Room was booked as an Executive room for  2 adults and a child.
Room was not too bad but it was set up for one adult .
Location was interesting.  There were places to eat near by if one did not wish to eat at the hotel.   Experience from start to finish was not a pleasant one.  We invited some guests to dine with us as there was a birthday-  the whole reason for the weekend away.
When the room was booked, we were not informed that they could not seat more than 6 people.  This was discovered  when we arrived to book in. We were then told that bar food would be available.  This was a great shock!  We only had breakfast so were were looking forward to being seated for a proper meal.  Our guests arrived and we told them the bad news,  the bad news was, they also only had breakfast that day.  We ordered the bar food which consisted of sandwiches, burgers, salad sausages, dips and various other bits.  The orders were mixed up, people were offered pork when it was not ordered,  those who ate pork did not received it, the food was cold,  one burger arrived not cooked properly.  there were 2 children with us their meals were unacceptable.  One person ended up sharing her meal  with someone else. Most of the food was not eaten.  Those of us who stayed at the Hotel actually went to bed hungry .  We complained, We were offered a round of drinks on the house,  not a bad gesture but having drinks on an empty stomach is not ideal. 
We did not pay for the bar food  this was one good thing.
When we went for breakfast,  again things, went wrong,  peppermint tea was ordered , they brought ordinary tea,  one cup of drinking chocolate was ordered,  2 cups of drinking chocolate was brought to the table.  We had calls and messages from our family and friends wanting to know how we were,  when they were told that the were more blunders made at breakfast  they could not believe or comprehend what was happening.   NICE LOCATION  A GREAT SHAME ABOUT THE SERVICE",2,2016,01,26
119,Wish it was longer!!,I Stayed here from 22nd to the 24th of January and couldn't fault a thing. The staff are very helpful room had everything you needed was totally worth the money and had a fantastic weekend in London because of it . We had the executive room with balcony which gave you a fantastic view of the o2 and its surroundings. You have everything you need around you it's the perfect place to stay.,5,2016,01,26
119,Excellent afternoon tea,"Went to this hotel (yacht) for an afternoon tea as a treat for my parents for Xmas. Everything was top class and lovely. My mother is disabled and you can park right close to it and everything is perfect for the physically disabled to access the place- well done. The food was very nice (not quite the nicest afternoon tea I've had - that was in Carton House, Maynooth, Ireland - but excellent none the less). The service was perfect, friendly and polite. The dining room is gorgeous. The views great. I would definitely recomend this place. Really good (and good value too).",5,2016,01,26
119,Not as good as we expected.,"On arrival, we were told that we could not drive up to the entrance to unload our luggage but had to drag them the 150 metres in the cold to the hotel entrance. We had booked three rooms, two of which were not ready. This was not a real problem as we stored our luggage in the one room that was ready and we had planned on going out for the afternoon. We took the Emirates Cable car across the river and caught the Thames clipper up to the London Eye before making our way back to the Sunborn.

We all met for dinner at 8pm. The Prosecco we ordered was flat. There was no set menu and the al a carte menu was very limited. The wine was very expensive, £30 a bottle and not particularly good quality.

On departing the ship the following day, we observed the al a carte menu for that evening was far more extensive.

Overall the rooms were good and very clean, the restaurant was the big disappointment.",4,2016,01,26
119,Excellent location with great views,"Stayed for a 3-day visit to the boat show. Can’t really fault the place, excellent location, fantastic room and great views. Staff very friendly and helpful
Only slight criticism was there was a distinct lack of glasses in what is a fabulous glass cabinet. Also meager coffee and tea making supplies, but seriously only mentioned this as it was the only fault to be found. Thanks for another great stay",5,2016,01,25
119,Hideous!!!!,"I travel all the time for work and so hotels are a regular thing. This hotel however has got to be one of the worst places I've EVER stayed for Customer Service! The staff are rude, they offer no laundry service and the iron in my room was rusty. When ironing a dress the iron stuck to it and made a huge hole. I asked the hotel to see if they could patch it for me (as it was for a black tie event that evening) to which they told me they couldn't but offered to pay for a cab to take me to a shopping centre (15 minutes before dinner) to look for a new dress! As I could not provide the receipt for the dress (that I explained was 2 years old) they gave me £50 compensation and absolutely no apology despite numerous attempts to speak with the manager (the dress was also worth much more). When checking out I was told he would contact me....that was 10 days ago! The food served at the dinner was also vile. The weird boiled chicken thing with apple was so inedible the entire table left it. My friend stayed at The Crowne Plaza over the road and said it was nice so I'd probably go with that next time.",1,2016,01,24
119,"Great accommodation, slightly spoilt by deposit","Me and my girlfriend stayed here on the night we saw Kevin Hart at the O2. Was a great night!!
Was pretty easy to find the Excel carpark, paid £15 for 24 hour parking, the yacht is literally on the right as you step out the Excel entrance which is helpful! 
Using the booking reference email, it looked like it was going to be easy to get into our room no problem until the last minute, they asked for a £40 deposit that we were never once told about. I checked the confirmation email again and even checked the website, could find absolutely no mention of a £40 deposit. As we didn't have that amount in our account (couple days before payday), we asked to pay in cash, we were informed that it would have to be a cash value of £100, what a joke!!! So in the end we had to phone up and get money transferred over which really put a dampener on the night! Money was put back in the account a few days later.

We got the cable cart over to the O2, was easy and enjoyable but a bit annoying having to catch the tube back as the cable cart shuts at 10pm. As for the rooms, I really couldn't fault them! Very clean, nice comfy bed, decent sized TV, hot shower and a lot of space in the room with a not so bad view of the Thames.

Would have given it a five star if it hadn't been for the silly £40 deposit. That wouldn't even bother me but to not be told at all is just unacceptable in my opinion. Would definitely recommend but make sure you have some money in the bank!",4,2016,01,24
119,Excellent accommodation and staff,"This is our second stay and will not be the last. It is a great hotel, clean, smart, staff extremely helpful. Nothing is too much trouble. Food excellent. We used to cost O2 and excel and brilliant location for that. Westfield not far away and easy access around London. Lovely waking up in the dock.",5,2016,01,24
119,Excellent,"What can I say about the Sunborn apart from it looks stunning, the interior doesn't disappoint either.

The rooms are large and comfortable with all the usual amenities, very clean and well thought out.

The only one downside is that the shower is either tepid or like coolant from a nuclear reactor with such a tiny adjustment between the two it's almost impossible to find a comfortable temperature.

Still love this place though and could spend hours just looking at the view of Canary Wharf and The O2.",5,2016,01,24
119,A real treat!,"We stayed for 2 nights on 14/15 Jan and could not fault the hotel for location, customer service, cleanliness and comfort. Huge room with great lounge/tv area. It was great to look out of the window and see the Thames, O2 arena and Emirates Airline cable cars, with fab sunset views. 

You cannot stay at a better place for the ExCel exhibition centre, and the platform for the DLR is all of a 3 minute walk away.

Didn't have breakfast or evening meal as loads of eateries in and around O2, but the menu did look rather impressive and would probably be worth considering for a special occasion. 

Would definitely return...",5,2016,01,23
119,A Excellent 24hrs  :-),"On a long weekend spent in London,we had the 1st night on board ,I just wanted to say it was a very nice experience for the start ,the food and drinks well excellent ,I would differently use this hotel again. So a big thanks to all the staff .",5,2016,01,22
119,Beautiful hotel,"Stayed 2 nights in a suite for my husbands birthday and what a great time we had ! We checked in before noon and our room wasn't ready, so they took our bags and we went exploring London. On return late afternoon the room was ready and our bags in the room. Clean spacious room with everything you need.
Getting into town is easy - either take the DLR which is a 5 min walk from the hotel or take the Emirates sky walk to the O2 then catch the Thames Clipper into the city - great views travelling on the river ! If you don't fancy the trip into the city the hotel restaurant and bar area is beautiful. There are plenty of bars and restaurants within a 5 min walk - and a Tesco Express ! 
Highly recommended and we are definitely planning to go back. ",5,2016,01,21
119,Amazing :),"I spend the night for my b'day in December as a gift from my Friends and it was just perfect.
Great welcome from reception staff following to the amazing room with balcony, exceptional bar and restaurant  service ....
Room was prepared for a special occasion with some amazing truffles on happy b'day plate.... 
Just love it.....",5,2016,01,21
119,Weekend in London,"We spent 2 days in this hotel. We liked the idea to stay on the Themse on a ship. Both the services and the accomodation were excellent, we liked them very much. The location was also very good, only a few minutes from the DLR station.",5,2016,01,21
119,Excellent for that special weekend,"I chose to book Sunborn to celebrate my boyfriend’s birthday. We decided to have a quick lunch on board before going to see a play. Although, not centrally located, public transport was easy to access, whilst giving an away from London sense whilst on board.
Staff were friendly and we got an upgrade as it was y boyfriend’s birthday. What more can you ask for?
I highly recommend the experience.",5,2016,01,18
119,Something different & Good location for Excel,"All very nice and a great location as we were biding the Excel for the London Boat Show.. You couldn't really get any closer to the expo site.

The ship is clearly not in use as a ship and appears to be a permanent fixture at the warf. It is very secure with solid morning posts so there is no swaying if that bothers you.

The restaurant food was good, the atmosphere in the bar good too.

The accommodation was very good and had a small deck. All very clean, comfortable.

I would certainly stay here again if I had business in the area.

There are also restatuarants and bars near by and no issue in getting taxis.

The manager made a point of introducing himself at checkout.. Nice touch.",4,2016,01,17
119,Comfortable stay,"We booked here as a pre Christmas treat to do some shopping and see family. We had also stayed earlier in the year at the Sunborn in Gibraltar and were keen to try their London offering.

If you are visiting the Excel or this part of London it is a good bet as it is very reasonable for what you get. It is also close to the O2, the Emirates Airline, Canary Wharf and Greenwich. 

We had a river view with balcony which was lovely. The rooms were very comfortable, although it was a bit tricky to watch to in bed due to the angle! Had a brilliant night sleep.

Didn't eat here but had some wine at at bar which had some nice views.

If you have been to the Sunborn Gibraltar, this is a completely different ship and is much smaller. The rooms are no comparison in size or luxury! That said we had a good comfortable stay and would return. It is just such a novelty to stay on a ship!",4,2016,01,17
119,"Seriously good but sash don't tell
A soul","Step aboard for a stay to remember, here in the dock land of London sits a ship that takes you wherever your imagination wants, it's a ship, a small luxury yacht, super yacht, that has a incredibly good crew that makes your time on board special, from the moment you embark to the moment you disembark, first class cruise all the way to your lovely room that promises a night to remember the fittings the facilities the decor the bed the shower the view the space the service the all out intention to make you feel like a bio, yes welcome aboard the Sunborn yacht hotel opposite the excel centre London, the bar facilities are with a view the restaurant though in my opinions limited menu offers a delightful culinary experience,? Breakfast is a feast, and the whole experience kindly brought to you with style. Value firm obey it is, there isn't anything to compete with the Sunborn, but please this is our little secret, please don't tell a soul.",5,2016,01,16
119,Like a cruise without leaving dock,"Beautiful yacht turned hotel.  Beautiful setting inside.  Very clean, smart, comfortable rooms. We had a meal in Lands End restaurant overlooking the dock.  Excellent, attentive service and food. Ideally placed for Greenwich, Excel and the O2.",5,2016,01,16
119,Quirky Hotel in London,"Being from ""oop north"" can make it difficult to know the ins and outs of getting a good hotel deal in London but my husband and I were excited to make a booking on the Sunborn Hotel as it looked like it would be good quality, and different from the usual chain of hotel that you see everywhere.
I booked a river view room and although the view wasn't particularly special, it was still a nice touch to the room. We found the cabins to be small but cosy and the bathrooms had some really nice toiletries in them. We stayed as we were going to see a concert in Wembley and found it easy to get to the underground as it's just a stone's throw away. We also went to the O2 Arena for an exhibition and travelled over the Emerate's airlines which was great. It all felt like it was in the right place for what we wanted.",5,2016,01,16
119,Something a little different,"Booked to stay for one night during the London Boat Show. Very glad we did. The room was excellent. We had a very comfortable River View Junior suite. We stayed 'on board' for dinner which we enjoyed very much. The wine was also excellent. Breakfast buffet was very good. Service throughout was very friendly and warm. Although there is no parking at the ship (except disabled) there is parking a few minutes walk away. We thought it well worth the effort. We also gave the Spa a try and both had a 25 minute massage which was a great start to the day. We will be back next year, if not before.",5,2016,01,15
119,Birthday surprise,"Hi my wife booked this as a surprise for my birthday.
It was fantastic. The rooms just luxurious as well as the rest of the boat. Unfortunately we had hit a lull whilst there as there were not many people on board.
Water view was fantastic. I appreciate some other comments about the food prices but we did not eat on board due to lack of atmosphere with very little guests, I guess this was because it was between New year and the start of the boat show.
Very close to the Thames barrier park and Canary Wharf.
If you like walking it is a good location. Access to the DLR is literally five minutes away at the side of the Excel arena. Will definitely consider going again.",5,2016,01,15
119,Could have been better,"My partner and I stayed here for my 30th Birthday back in October, the yacht was hard to find but we managed to find parking and get to it. When we arrived the receptionist wasn't particulary helpful. We asked if we could book into the spa but she said that it was fully booked and if you want to use the spa you must book in advance. (we were not told this before booking) I asked if there was a pool that we could use just to use up some time whilst on board she replied no, there is a pool at another hotel we can use however there is an extra charge. I asked if we could book a table for dinner and she just about squeezed us in for a late dinner, again apparently this all needs to be booked in advance so I suppose we were quite lucky with that. I asked what time breakfast was and she told us we needed to pay extra as again this was not included, I thought we had booked a room with breakfast but anyhow I didn't bother to challange it as at this point I just wanted to go and rest in our room. There was no help with our bags we had to take them ourselves to our room, however the next day when we were checking out I did see someone being helped with there bags. The room we stayed in was beautiful with a balcony over looking the water, beautiful view, was surprised how big our room was. Very clean couldn't fault it at all. On the table was a lovely message from the manager wishing me a happy birthday with some chocolates which I thought was a nice gesture.
When it was time for dinner we went to the 2nd floor and was greeted by a friendly waiter who took us to our table. We recieved bread and olives to nibble on whilst we waited to order our starters etc. I asked one of the waiters if we could move table near to the window as it was a lovely view and that was fine however, we were left there for over an hour waiting for our food which we hadn't even ordered and when I asked the waiter why we had not been served he said he forgot to tell the other staff that we had moved and they thought that we had gone. I was quite upset at this point as it was 10:30pm and we were very hungry. They did however apologise and we were told we didn't have to pay the service charge. Above all the food was very nice and presented well. All in all this would have been a perfect stay if the information was clear before we booked. A great experience but not sure if I would come back.",4,2016,01,14
119,excellent  well worth the price its been our 7th vist and willl keep going back,the room is fantastic had a balcony it was romantic the staff fantastic always there to help excellent customer service the food was superb we absolutley loved the food well worth the price i had duck which i never had before and i can say it was 10/10 it was lovely i would highly recomend we will be going back,5,2016,01,14
119,"Not Just a Hotel, an Experience","We Stayed here on New Years Day after staying in London for New Years Eve.  The yacht is beautiful, gorgeous feature staircase and lovely decor. Friendly and helpful staff.  We had an executive suite with a balcony which was gorgeous, spacious and very comfy with a queen sized bed. Lovely view of the river. Lixurious feel tonthe boat 

We felt the bar and dining area were a bit too formal so we had a walk around the Quays and there were some nice restaurants and the cable cars over the Thames. 

The check in wasnt great as we were not informed that everyone had a late check out on New Years Day so we did a lot of hanging around until we got our room bur we did have a lovely stay.",4,2016,01,13
119,Excellent Stay,"My husband and I visited at the end of December, the staff were excellent very friendly and welcoming, our room was excellent, so spacious and clean. We had just booked for one night as we were leaving from London City Airport the following day and it was only a short walk away.
The only thing that I was not too happy with was the 12% service charge on drinks !!!!
We did not eat at the hotel but would visit the hotel again and book a table for dinner.",5,2016,01,13
119,Interesting but cheapskating.,"Booked 2 nights here for my husband's birthday. It was plush and lovely and we were upgraded to an executive room where the carpet was so deep that one felt one had to take one's shoes off to go in. 
The room was glorious, big, light and beautiful; it helps that the boat is very new so everything is still fresh and clean. We also had a balcony that looked out over the water to the buildings on the other side. Unfortunately, the tablet in our room didn't work and they had to come and replace it. It would be a lovely idea if one could take it off its base and move around the room with it, but it has a security thing on the back so you have to sit right by it to use it. I can understand that people might pinch it, but then why have it. All the hotel information was on there but I have to say, a folder would have been much more user friendly. 
There was a very posh nespresso machine for coffee, but the cups are smallish so the coffee you get is incredibly strong; far too strong for me. When I went to ask if there were any sachets of nescafe I might have instead, the guy on reception chose not to understand what I was talking about and said I could always have coffee in the bar.....but I wanted in the room, in privacy, and I'd have had to pay for it in the bar. And there were no biscuits or anything to go with the tea and coffee, and that seemed a little mean. 
The mini bar had nothing but a couple of bottles of water in. When I enquired about this, I was told it was so that guests can put their own things in the fridge.....in which case, call it a fridge, NOT a mini bar. 
The bathroom was light and with a wonderful shower but there was no magnifying mirror for make up, or emery board for nails. 
Breakfast was plentiful and varied and our evening meal was okay but a bit nouvelle cuisineish. 
It was fun to stay there but I'm not sure I'd do it again.",4,2016,01,12
119,Sunborn.,Had a lovely stay. Staff very helpful nothing too much trouble. Everywhere spotless . Will return.  Could've been anywhere in the world. Ideal treat if going to excel . Huge room . Good views of London Dome ,4,2016,01,12
119,Beautiful boat,"We booked 2 rooms, one with a sea view. The room are spacious, because you get a little sitting area with a sofa.The sea view room is beautiful, there is a small balcony in the room, so you have a spectacular view. The bar is open till late, so you can relax here until you want to go to sleep. Breakfast was good and the views are amazing.The reception area is beautiful! Would stay again!",5,2016,01,12
119,A welcome break after the London chaos!,"We stayed here for the weekend when we went to the O2 for a concert. It was so much better than I thought it was going to be, after all a yacht docked in London doesn't sound so appealing...

It was really lovely, the staff welcomed us and the first impressions were great. Everything was beautiful and obviously well looked after. We went down into our room and I couldn't believe how big it was- it was huge!! Our big window looked straight out onto the water and was very peaceful and relaxing. It was easy to change temperature and I much appreciated being able to warm the place up after being outside. The bathroom is quite small but I guess thats to be expected. It was clean and cozy.

We had the breakfast and it was lovely if a bit cold, staff couldn't have been more helpful.

Location is excellent, very close to the emirates sky ride, a few lovely restaurants nearby. 

Will definitely be back.",5,2016,01,11
119,What a truly amazing stay,"The service received from the staff was excellent from the moment we entered the hotel to leaving the next day, nothing was too much trouble, the room was fantastic, spotlessly clean and comfortable with everything that you need for a very enjoyable stay close to hand. The location was very close to the Excel centre the 02 arena, with restaurant's close to hand, and a tube station with access to Central London some 5 minutes walk away.",5,2016,01,11
119,Luxury Stay,"Fantastic hotel with the joy of being on a boat! Friendly staff and good food. The rooms are immaculate with iPad technology and Molton Brown provided. 

Great location and close to Stratford Intl station. From the moment you arrive you are treated as you would expect from a quality establishment. Perfect hotel for a special celebration or just a complete chilled weekend. 

Treat yourself and book a stay. ",5,2016,01,11
119,"A real find, tranquility amid chaos!","I have stayed at most hotels around Excel and have found them 'hard and busy'.  This is probably because the guests are working long hours at shows and changing over regularly.
The Sunborn is an oasis.  The welcome was calm and set the tone for the whole stay.
Breakfasts are superb, a wide selection and the dinner was brilliant.
The room was huge with a very comfortable sitting area and a river view.
There are also other restaurants around which opens the choice in this unusual area of London which can feel isolated.",5,2016,01,11
119,Lovely stay,"Stayed one Saturday night as went to London Boat show at excel and wanted a god quality hotel and dinner in the evening. Hotel location is great, very close to excel, about a 5 min walk and I would recommend parking at excel itself as flat rate for 24 hours. 
Hotel was immaculate, great sized room with view across the docks. Dinner was fabulous and cocktails were great. Quick and friendly service. Only downside was breakfast where they ran out of some items quickly so people were stood about waiting for more to be cooked. Need bigger serving dishes for busy times.
However thoroughly enjoyed our stay and would recommend for somewhere a bit different but of high quality. ",4,2016,01,10
119,Very impressive,"Wow, fantastic meal and great service.
Not been here for a year but great that it's not changed. 
Please do not be put off and think this place is expensive because it's onboard the ship.
I would recommend the shredded lamb and the war horse wine.

I can't understand why the restaurants not busier but I really enjoyed it and will look to go back again.",5,2016,01,10
119,Spa treatment and afternoon tea,"I was recently given a groupon voucher as a gift which included a massage and afternoon tea at The Sunborn.  I'd  never heard of it before and was pleasantly surprised to find out it is permanently moored next to Excel in East London - only a 30 minute drive from my home. I'd envisaged having to take bus, train and tube to get there.  Parking nearby seems pricey at £15 per day but that's the equivalent of travel for two on public transport so I was happy to pay. The hotel is beautiful inside and out; luxurious carpet that you sink into,  gleaming chandeliers, Molton Brown in the loos! The 45 minute deep tissue massage was firm but not too harsh and ultimately relaxing.  Surroundings were pleasant.  Afternoon tea included a glass of Laurent Perrier champagne. Tea choices were plentiful including decaff, herbal, fruit. Scones were light and crumbly with generous portions of jam and clotted cream supplied. Sandwiches came in four varieties on different breads daintily cut into fingers.  The macaron,  brandy basket and chocolate cup elements were far too sweet for my liking but if sweet patisserie is your thing then you'd love these. If you don't have a voucher  costs start at £22 for regular tea and £32 with champagne.  Be warned if you order more champagne it's £14 per glass...standard charge in hotels but steep if you're expecting it to be £10! Everything was beautiful presented. Service was friendly, helpful and efficient. I'd go again as it was a fantastic,  extravagant experience.  Great treat for someone's birthday.  ",4,2016,01,09
119,Luxurios relaxation,"This trip was arranged to celebrate my wife's 70th birthday. We were warmly welcomed on our arrival including the receptionist wishing my wife a happy birthday. We had a beautifully appointed room overlooking the water. To mark my wife's birthday the hotel had provided a card and chocolates in our room. I had arranged an inclusive dinner with champagne which was served in the restaurant overlooking the dock with the backdrop of the Canary Wharf complex, O2 Dome and Emirates Air Line all lit up and forming an impressive view. The service in the restaurant was very efficient and friendly. The food was superb. The bed was very comfortable and we had an undisturbed and good night's sleep. Breakfast was to the same high standard as the previous evening's dinner. Checkout was very efficient with no mistakes on the bill. I can thoroughly recommend this hotel.",5,2016,01,08
119,Excellent Accommodation and really good value for money!!,Although the sunborn is slightly out for the centre it is worth the extra travel for the experience and price. The cost is very reasonable and the accommodation is amazing. Rooms are very spacious and light with excellent facilities. The breakfast is slightly over priced but very nice. Bar prices are slightly expensive but thats as you would expect from any hotel. This is my second stay at this hotel and I will definitely be returning. All staff were extremely helpful and friendly. I left an item of clothing behind which was quickly recovered and returned to me via post.,5,2016,01,08
119,Sunburn treat!,"Superb visit/service. Fantastic room (best nights sleep for weeks)!!  Fabulous breakfast. 
Can't wait to stay again!!
The yacht has a way of making you feel special. From the moment you arrive to the time you leave.... You will feel split! I did!
The rooms are huge. We had a river view and this was a great treat, to look across the Thames. 
We were at a concert at the O2 and went across on the cable car! What a treat. The return journey after the concert was easy and the excel stop is right beside the yacht so a nice end to the evening with a drink in the bar.  We waited a while to be served (it was busy) and paid a high price for the drinks but we expected to. It was still the nicest drink of the evening.
The location is perfect for O2 visits and would highly recommend it!",5,2016,01,08
119,Amazing experience,"I had booked a family room with every intention to sneak in a upgrade once i get there, we had booked 5 nights from Christmas day so I thought it would be worth a punt. On arrival I was greeted by a very proffesional team member called Gytis. We struck a converstion straight away and the rest of the family warmed to him too. As I got to the desk i enquired about room sizes making it clear i needed space for my 2 young children to move around in. Gytis suggested i looked at the room option prior to making a decision and he was happy to show us around. Being a bargain hunter i made it clear i expected the best but unwilling to part with my cash. All the staff said they would be happy to accomodate as soon as i decide. The rooms were lovely, as were some of the views. Through the shear effort and the feeling of welcome from Gytis, his manager and other staff we agreed to settle for the exec junior suite. The room was clean and freshened up every day, most important, my wife and kids loved it. We had an amazing time, felt relaxed and looked aftered, Gytis would pop over and call every day just to make sure we were ok. A few things i would look to improve and spoek to the staff about, but over all i was extreamly satisfied and would definetly go back again. Thanks to all the staff, and a special mention to the star of the team, Gytis.",5,2016,01,07
119,Onboard for 5 nights,"The Sunborn Yacht is permanently moored near the Excel Centre in London.  It offers a surprisingly large bedroom (With settee and desk in the room).  The rooms were very comfortable and clean.  The breakfast in the morning offered excellent views over to the Millennium Dome and surrounding area. Even though the hotel is in London, the location is very quiet and I had a great night sleep every night.   The issue I had was the check-in, very slow and to be honest not to the level I would expect from a hotel of this calibre.  I enjoyed my stay as I was working at the Excel centre and for this the Sunborn is very well placed.",5,2016,01,06
119,Wow!,"We stayed here for one night at the end of October. We were blown away by the beauty of this yacht. Our suite was just amazing.... Massive.... Beautifully appointed. 
Upon arrival we went into the bar for champagne and oysters with views across to the O2 arena and the Emirates Air Line.  Perfect spot if you are going to the O2 or Excel arena, which it is slap bang right next to. Only a 5 min walk from nearest railway station, Custom House.  The staff were very polite and friendly. Would recommend without hesitation.",5,2016,01,05
119,A wonderful unique stay on the Thames...,"Booked the Sunborn for myself and my 13yr olds treat for a birthday present, as we were going to Capitals Jingle Bell Ball at the o2 Arena.
What a fabulously unique way to stay in the capital ! We had a classic river view room with balcony ( a must ! ). Rooms are beautifully appointed and very spacious, with complimentary Moulton Brown toiletries, and a tea and coffee maker.
Beds and linen were extremely comfortable.
Alas, we didn't eat on board due to the timing of out stay, however there are plenty restaurants in the vicinity catering for breakfast and meals throughout the day / evening.
We drove to the Sunborn and Parking was £15 per 24hrs at the Excel Exhibition Centre ( try and park by the exit as its closest to the yacht ).
Alternatively, the DLR Excel rail link is 5 mins away.

I will be returning later in the year with my husband - truly fabulous place !",5,2016,01,04
119,Perfect overnight stay,"Stayed here three weeks ago on a Saturday night with three of my children so that we could go to Excel first thing next day for BRICK (the Lego event).  Everything about it was good for us.  We had an executive suite, using the living room as a bedroom for the children.  Hotel added a rollaway to the pull out sofa bed.  There was still space to walk around and a dining table where we could enjoy room service with a view of the place to which we were going next day!  Large terrace made up of half the bow deck of the boat.  Amazing bathroom/wet-room with giant bath and  2 open showers.  Great for family with London grime to wash off and hair to wash.  Also sauna!

Friendly staff very keen to help wherever possible and to check that we had what we needed.  Activity packs for the children.  Room service can be ordered by tablet and comes fast.  Super buffet breakfast which helps with a quick start in the morning because there are things that each child likes and they can have them straight away.  Get to make there own hot chocolate drink!  Left our luggage here which meant that we could sort out our bags and all the paraphernalia that we had picked up at the show in this haven before making our tube, train, taxi journey home.

Pricey, but would stay here again given the opportunity, if I was to want to make the most of a day in docklands..",5,2016,01,04
119,Genuine luxury,"Everything about this hotel was outstanding.  The service on arrival and throughout our stay, the spacious and well equipped room with a view of the river, and the bar and restaurant food and drinks were exquisite.  Particularly nice touch giving my girlfriend a drinks coupon for her birthday.  A little out of the way in terms of location within London but easily accessible from the DLR and worth the hassle.",5,2016,01,04
119,Fantastic!!,"I stayed here with my partner for my Birthday, and it is simply one of the best hotels I have ever stayed at! The staff were friendly and very helpful, the rooms were lovely with a fantastic view of the river. I also received a hand written letter from management wishing me a happy birthday!! We had a drink in the hotel bar in the evening which was wonderful; great service and a nice atmosphere. Breakfast was fantastic; nice variation of both hot and cold food with again, excellent service. We also had a seat right by the window for breakfast so we could look out onto the river Thames. I honestly could not fault this hotel; what a wonderful experience! Would definetely recommend staying here, plus easy to get to other parts of London if going out in the day/evening. I will definetely be returning in the near future. ",5,2016,01,03
119,New Years Eve,"My partner booked a room for the night on New Year's Eve and we were both impressed.

The place has a nice feel to it with the interior being rather stylish.
We found the room to be spacious and very clean.

We also booked a restaurant reservation and really enjoyed the food and tentative service.

Overall a great place to stay if you wish to treat yourselves.",5,2016,01,02
119,Brilliant! Amazing!,"This was a birthday treat, and to walk up to the beautiful boat was exciting in itself! But when you get onboard  it is beautiful! The room exceeded all expectations very large with a massive bed which was the most comfortable we've slept in for ages, just what you need after a day in the Capital! But so quiet and peaceful we didn't hear a thing! The staff were so friendly and polite and the receptionist made sure we knew how to get to the O2 . We will defiantly book here again and only a very short walk from train station into central London",5,2016,01,02
119,Fantastic from start to finish!,"I booked a room for my partner's birthday and he was not disappointed.
I was slightly worried that they do not have parking, particularly as I don't drive and wanted to surprise my partner so didn't tell him where we were going.
I needn't have worried because the nearest public car park is only a minutes walk away and was only 15 for 24 hours.
The boat is spectacular and the staff couldn't have been more helpful.
They even had some birthday chocolates and a card laid out in the stunning room.
We had lunch in the bar which was great and enjoyed a beautiful dinner at the Lands end restaurant upstairs.
We will definitely be staying again!",5,2016,01,02
119,Room with no air,Can't open window...no air...noisy upstairs guests heavy banging all night...ordered room service desserts never arrived....I can't go on deck....floating prison is what it felt like....very poor and expensive....,1,2016,01,02
119,Great location for events at the O2,"We stayed here for one night when we were going to a show at the O2 and I have to say that I was quite impressed, I booked will in advance and was lucky enough to get an excellent price for what was in essence a mini suite, we then crossed the river for the show by cable car which is a fantastic way to arrive! On the morning of our departure there was also an earlybird discount on breakfast (£7.50) which contained really good ingredients.",5,2016,01,02
119,Birthday treat....,We booked this for my birthday as we wanted something different this hotel is beautiful our room was a good size beds are very comfortable bathroom was a little small and there was no bath but still had everything we needed the view at night is wonderful the bar like any hotel was a little expensive but all in all a lovely stay ,5,2015,12,31
119,Fantastic Stay for my Teen Son's Birthday,"A second return to the Sunborn this time for my son's 13th Birthday ( his request)

From the moment we arrived the staff were welcoming and made a huge fuss over the birthday boy he felt really special.

We stayed riverside in a Family Executive room our terrace overlooked the water and the twinkling lights of Canary Wharf put a smile on our faces

We are already planning  a return visit in the Spring /summer where will can then take advantage of siting outside  on the terraces

Thanks Team Sunborn for another great stay!",5,2015,12,31
119,Christmas getaway,"The Sunborn Yacht hotel was amazing, the reception area has a beautiful staircase and the rooms are immaculate. We were upgrading to a room with a balcony which was lovely and can imagine even better in the summer. We had breakfast and it was lovely, the staff are all so friendly and helpful. I will definitely be returning here and will be recommending to friends and family. Thanks for a fantastic stay.",5,2015,12,31
119,Amazing Yacht,"Anchored in Royal Victoria Dock, as you enter the reception which is beautifully decorated with a brass and glass stairs case. The receptionist was very friendly and handed our key. Our room on the ground floor was spacious and we had a port hole looking over the dock and East London, and had the usual TV, coffee machine, radio, IPAD, and free Wi-Fi. The bathroom was very small just a shower and basin which is normal if you have an internal cabin on any cruise ship. Adjourned to the bar area with views of the Emirates Air Line Cable Car, and Canary Wharf. From the bar area you have access to the outside of the yacht.
In the morning went to the breakfast area, again loads of views around the harbour, and had a short wait to get a table, and the serve yourself breakfast was excellent even the poached eggs which you can ask for. 
The yacht is a bit in the middle of nowhere, although moored next to the ExCel centre and a short distance to DLR Custom House. Within easy walking distance there’s a few hotel bars, IBIS and Novotel, and a few restaurants close by just outside the DLR, and along the main road going towards the cable car
The yacht is easy accessible for wheel chairs and can get taxis outside the front door and the area around is all flat. And don’t be alarmed when you see airplane few hundred feet up which has just taken off from City airport 
",5,2015,12,31
119,Birthday Gift,"Our daughter and our son-in-law treated us to a night with breakfast, on the Sunborn Yacht inLondon. We were upgraded as it was my husbands 70 birthday to a cabin with balcony looking over the river and Canary Wharf. To see the skyline at night was magical. The room was so comfortable the whole ship was spotless and the staff could not do enough for you. We cruise regularly but not quite to this standard of accomodation,so it was a real treat. Thank you very much to the staff, and of course our family.",5,2015,12,30
119,"Not great for Christmas, but good for other times of year.","My family and I came up on Christmas Eve to stay over the festive period and first impressions were great. From the outside the boat looks impressive and everything was sparkling clean. The negatives were: a distinct lack of Christmas decorations and for most of the ship you would have no idea that it was Christmas at all.
The only thing to look forward to on the day was Christmas lunch, which was reasonable, but the atmosphere was very lacking. There was literally nothing else to do all day once you had finished lunch. There were no games in the lounge area and with nothing open all day and no transport, this was a real issue. I have stayed at other hotels for Christmas and they make a real event of the festive period, but this was a real disappointment.
The hotel itself is lovely with large rooms and the staff are very accommodating, but definitely not one for a Christmas gathering! We spent the whole day in our room after lunch, trying to kill time. Had we have known there was nothing going on we would have booked elsewhere or brought some things to do. Such a shame because it wouldn't take much to get some games for the lounge area or at least get more decorations.
So, in a nutshell, a beautiful hotel for any other time of the year.",4,2015,12,29
119,Great surprise,"Myself and my partner stayed here on Sunday night and had a fantastic stay. I organised this as a surprise for his birthday and we were upgraded free of charge because of this. The room was beautiful with a lovely view of the river from our balcony, it was exceptionally clean and tidy. We also ate dinner on the boat which was fantastic. Couldn't fault a single thing about our stay, the staff and room was everything we could ask for and more. We highly recommend!",5,2015,12,29
119,Amazing stay in unique hotel,"We stayed on board the Sunborn back in June as we were seeing a concert at the o2 and also for a birthday treat for my mum. After searching through lots of hotels in the area I came across the Sunborn which not only looked amazing but was also reasonably priced.
On arrival the boat (which is located near the Excel centre) was absolutely AMAZING and lived up to all of our expectations!!! The staff were all extremely friendly and helpful and even gave us a free drink each to celebrate my mums birthday. We had a dock side room which although it didn't have amazing views (we weren't worried about that), it was pure luxury complete with sofa, coffee making facilities and a really comfy bed and a lot bigger than some of the high end hotels which I've stayed in when visiting london. The fixtures and fittings were of the highest quality and we liked the fact that once checked in you could only gain access to the room via the lifts and only with use of your keycard. This added security was great especially as we knew that we would be travelling back to the hotel late at night.
As I said the location of the hotel is perfect for a visit to the o2. We took the emirates cable car over to the o2, these are located just a short walk from the hotel along the victoria docks. The concert finished too late to get the cable cars back so we used the DLR which was only a couple of stops to the hotel and was really quick. 
We paid to have breakfast and although fairly pricy it was beautiful with lots of choice from cereal, fruit and a cooked breakfast.
Overall we loved our trip and stay on the Sunborn, so much so that we've been recommending it to everyone we know and will definitely be visiting again if we are attending events at the o2 or are wanting a stay in London. A big well done to the amazing staff who made our stay one to remember, its been one of the highlights of our year. If anyone is looking for a home away from home as well as a stay in a hotel which is totally unique then this is it!!",5,2015,12,27
119,Wow ,Wow was the phrase my wife used when seeing this hotel.  And it is. If nothing on at the excel then this is at a reasonable price. Great receptionist allowed us to check in early and have access to room at 12.30 as one available. Great cabin. River view is better than dock view. The lowest grade of cabin is very good and twice the size of most hotel rooms. ,5,2015,12,27
119,Motionless and clean ,"Lovely hotel enjoyable stay - staff extremely helpful, nothing too much trouble.

We had breakfast very nice they were able to provide gluten free tots and sausages, have stayed five star London and never had the sausages provided. Good base for the 02. 

If booking this hotel request a room facing the river as upgrade once there may not be available. 

Would stay here again, was very windy due to weather at time of stay, however yacht is anchored to side of dock so was a motionless comfortable stay  ",5,2015,12,26
119,"Stunning hotel, not your standard hotel!","Great rooms, larger than most hotels on land. Quality fittings in the room. Reception area looks stunning too.  This is a great choice for something different.  Don't worry about the boat rocking, it is moored in a dock, not actually on the river.  If you can, go for the sea view.  Breakfast is reasonably priced for a London quality hotel at £12 on a Sunday, with plenty of choice.",5,2015,12,24
119,Great ambience ,Great ambience the selection of sweet and savoury for evening tea was okay not exceptional but overall  it was a good evening. The macaroons were more biscuity than mellow the clotted cream and scones were out of this world the sandwiches were a mixed bag. ..the selection of tea excuisite!!!! The champagne glass was not bad!,4,2015,12,24
119,Noval Hotel,"Wanted to do something a little different. So booked this after recommendation from friends.
Very generous afternoon tea with champers, prob the best & cheapest in London.
Best roast duck I have ever tasted.
Massive bedroom & clean
Friendly & attentive staff.
Sadly it doesn't have much atmosphere, even though it was busy.
Location not that good either. This is no reflection on the hotel though, just be prepared to tube.
Fab views over the city at night from the restaurant.",4,2015,12,24
119,One of London's best kept secrets,"The Sunborn yacht hotel is a great place to stay when visiting London.
Easy access to central London on DLR rail to Tower of London.
or the more scenic route by cable car to O2 arena and Thames clipper down to London eye with all the well known landmarks on the way.
The hotel is extremely comfortable and the food is very good. The staff are very helpful.
A great place to stay when there is an exhibition at EXCEL next door.",5,2015,12,24
119,CHRISTMAS TREAT FOR THE FAMILY,"I Booked four rooms for one night, one for myself and husband and the other three for our children and their partners for a pre-Christmas treat on 20th December. We all had a wonderful time, not one complaint from anyone.  We booked a table in the Lands End Restaurant and was pleasantly surprised by the variation on the set menu and when the food was served up it was delicious, again no negative comments from anyone.  It was great to have the Emirates cable car station just a short walk away which we took advantage of and went across to the O2 for breakfast.

The cabins are very spacious, well equipped and extremely clean, it is like being on a luxury cruise liner, minus the heavy seas.

The reception staff are very polite, friendly and helpful.

All-in-all a fantastic stay in one of the nicest hotels in London.",5,2015,12,23
119,Very lovely stay at the sunborn,I have to say this was one of the most nicest hotels I've every stayed in. And the receptionist staff (especially Nazma) were so accommodating. I would highly recommend this to anyone who wants to have a lovely weekend with friends family or their partner.  ,5,2015,12,22

119,Great venue for a Christmas party,"We came  here for our Christmas party.   There was about 100 of us there for the party and food was excellent, great service and amazing location and set up.  They were really flexible and did anything we asked.",4,2015,12,22
119,Fantastic base for the O2 and exploring London,"Went to see Simply Red at the O2 and used the opportunity to visit the Shard and central London. Great base for both and the Emirates Airline for travelling to the O2 is a short walk away. :-) Excellent, extremely comfortable rooms and the king sized bed is one of the best I've ever slept on.",5,2015,12,22
119,Lovely start to Christmas ,Stay at the hotel on Saturday the 19th December and had the most wonderful stay. From start to end all the staff were very friendly and helpful especially Teodora in the bar. We will definitely being staying there again ,5,2015,12,21

Bar staff. PS we went to see Simply Red at the O2",5,2015,12,21
119,Fabulous stay for Wedding Anniversary,The Sunborn Super Yacht is amazing. Great location and the Emirates sky ride is a 5 minute walk away. Great service. Really comfy bed. Good tea and coffee facilities. Did not eat 'on board' as wanted to explore but plenty of choice of restaurants close by. Will definitely stay again.,5,2015,12,20
119,Nice experience being on a boat,"Nice hotel, comfortable rooms, good breakfast. I did not try the restaurant for other meals. Being on a boat is nice, I had a great room with balcony over the water, good views. It's location right next to Excel adds to the picture.",4,2015,12,20
119,Luxury venue,"This was the second time I'd stayed on the Sunborn Yacht and will go back as often as I can. Friendly staff, superb quality build and finish make this my choice venue to stay in London. 
High tech room services system and great service provided. I've had an upgrade each time I've stayed to have a balcony, with views over the water and famous lights of London. The bed was extremely comfortable and I got a fantastic night's sleep. 

I was at a concert at the O2 and after a 3 minute walk, the ride direct over the Thames on the Emirates-sponsored cable car was hugely convenient. Travel into central London the following day is easy using the very close DLR and then tube.",5,2015,12,20
119,Overnight stay for Simply Red Concert,"Comfortable bed, luxury surroundings, excellent coffee & tea facilities
Friendly staff.  Breakfast was the nicest had in hotel, with waterside/front views
Nice touches with dressing gowns/slippers and toiletries
We returned from the 02 to enjoy a drink and a snack in the bar and found that the kitchen had closed, which was disappointing. 

The location is very good for all London attractions, the cable car is a 5 minute walk away, with easy access to the 02 - which we braved, although very high and scarrey!!!  We were even offered a free ride, as we didn't enjoy the experience, don't think we will be taking him up on that offer!!
 We will definitely be going back to stay, hopefully in the summer to enjoy the outside facilities 
Thank you to all the staff for an enjoyable stay

",5,2015,12,19
119,Fantastic Experience,"Stayed here for two nights. First impression was fabulous exactly like the pictures on the website. We booked a family room which looked amazing but we had a problem with the air conditioning and were upgraded to a family room with a balcony. On the first night we had cocktails in the bar, a bit pricey but were really good. On the second night we ate in the restaurant. The food was of an excellent quality although the wine was a bit expensive. A bit of a gripe is that a 'service charge' of 12.5% is added to everything you buy and in the bar a gap was left for a gratuity. I would think most people are well equipped enough to decide how much to leave for good service. That apart, if we were ever in that part of London again we would not hesitate to stay here again.",5,2015,12,18
119,Overnight Stay for a Concert at the O2 Arena,"Very Very nice hotel, great staff, great food, great service set on a very very Nice Yacht . Rooms are a good size. Easy to find. Only one small disappointment,  we wanted to order an Afternoon Tea with Champagne and where told that you have to order 24hours in advance. Seems a little strange as this hotel prides itself on its service. But still I Cant wait to return again.",5,2015,12,18
119,"Great location, wonderful stay.","What a place to stay.........
It starts with your first view, unless you are an Oligarch then this can not fail to impress.
Reception is well staffed and wait times minimal. The hotel being a yatch is roomy, air conditioned and comfortable. Air con not noisy in our room.
Very shiny glitzy interior. Big TV if you want to watch. Communal areas spacious and comfortable.
The room (overlooking the water was large, very clean and extremely comfortable. The bathroom was spacious and has great showers, New skin please....
Breakfast was unending if you wanted it to be, or a light continental should you choose.
Not the cheapest but worth the spend, access to the whole of London via DLR and underground is a short walk away as is the Emirates Air to the O2 arena. 
One point to note. We returned to the hotel at night and a very lively but well behaved wedding was occurring on board. It being loud I thought there goes my nights sleep. I could not have been more wrong.
The room was so well sound proffer I could not hear it at all.
The following day was Fathers day and our Son joined us for breakfast, the hotel were very accommodating and did not flinch when a non guest ate at breakfast.
The staff were all very helpful, considerate and attentive without being pushy.
We had a delightful stay and will again.
My advice is......
Go, spend a little extra and enjoy. If you can afford a suite (I could not) take one.",5,2015,12,18
119,"Very nice hotel, and a bit different","Relatively unique experience, good value for money rooms for a hotel situated so close to London (next to the ExCel centre). Easy access to the DLR, tube network, Emirates AirLine and the O2. Friendly, helpful staff. Very nice rooms. Quiet and comfortable.  Heated floor in bathroom. Didn't eat in the restaurant but the food did look and sound very nice.",4,2015,12,17
119,much more fun than your standard 4 star hotel!!,"We celebrated my wife's 65th birthday on this yacht hotel, it exceeded all expectations!!
It was immaculate on every level,really spacious cabins and good spacious companionways and public areas.
The reception area was light, clean and airy, manned by very helpful and polite staff who were very knowledgeable ,in fact all the staff on the Yacht Hotel were polite and helpful
The restaurants were very clean and well laid out and the service was outstanding, the food and the choice was very good.
The Buffet breakfast had a very good choice and it was eat as much as you want for £12-50p really good value for money.
It was a totally peaceful break with no hassle, cant wait to return!!!!!!!!!!!",5,2015,12,16
119,Sunborn London Hotel,I visit this hotel regular for business meetings. It offers a first class service very comparable to some of the best hotels in London with the added luxury of being located on the River Thames and spectacular views of London. It is also very close to London City airport and within 20 minutes from Central London.,5,2015,12,16
119,Decadent accommodation for a reasonable budget,"When we organised a recent event at O2 London, we were requiring accommodation. 

The organiser suggested a stay at Sunborn London. My first thought was whether I would feel the movement as the weather was predicted to be blustery. 

However, there was nothing to worry about, the boat was serene. 

The quality of the accommodation was very high, the staff very friendly and the location excellent.

As a group we also ate dinner on the yacht. It was a budget stretcher, and probably failed to live up to the rest of the experience. This was not sufficient to detract from the experience, but I will likely choose another restaurant in future. ",5,2015,12,16
119,A little out of the Way but not a bad spot,"We enjoyed our stay at the Sunborn  While it was a little farther out of the historic district than it looked it was not terrible.  We had one day we even made it back out to the yacht and then back to the city.  It was literally right next to the DLR so getting in and out of the city was super easy.  I will say it was a little spotty on the details.  We had three people in our room and yet they continued to replace our glasses with only two, they replaced our towels every day except one when they hung them back up but since we did not know who's was who's we had to request new ones anyway.  Small things but noticeable.  the staff were all super nice and very helpful though.  Things were also very clean.  We would stay there again and are actually contemplating staying at one of their other yachts.",4,2015,12,15
119,What's all the fuss about? ,"Well. We visit MANY hotels world wide and after booking a trip to the o2 we decided to try something a bit different (as we always do) and booked a night in the so called luxury of the sunborn. 
First impressions. It's a big boat next to the xcel centre. The staff need to speak better English. Smart. Yes. Polite. Yes. But communication is limited. You may as well be abroad!!! 
We booked a standard room and paid extra for a river view. Why? The window is so far away from the wall it's difficult to see the view, so why charge more? Of yea if course. Silly me. Money. 
The room was basic. Not as good as it looks on the websites. Clean, granted. But basic. Quiet? Yes. But don't rely on fresh air. You don't get any. We stayed in December so dread to think how hot the room would be in summer. 
We booked a table in the restaurant for 6pm. The 3 courses Xmas meal for £35. Thought we would book early to get to the o2 which is half hour by tube. (Don't listen to anyone else. It's half an hour door to door). So our food took ages. Do much so that we missed the 3rd course BUT we're still charged for it. Joke. 
Lastly. We went for a pre dinner drink. 4 X gin and tonics (singles) £45 quid. This included a £5 mandatory service charge which you then have the option to add to when the bill arrives. So beware. This happened in the restaurant as well. 
So if you are looking for something quirky. This is it. But there are better paces. And beware of the cost. It's very over priced for what you get. And the food and service ain't all that. Just saying.  ",3,2015,12,15
119,Anniversary surprise,"This was the most amazing experience, the rooms were really plush and well thought out., we were upgraded as it was our anniversary.  The staff were very polite and attentive thank you all for making our break one we will never forget",5,2015,12,15
119,Amazing!,"What a great find! A lovely location, perfect for the Excel or, in our case, the O2.  The staff were wonderful, polite, efficient and helpful.  We just had a standard room but it was huge, much bigger than normal hotel rooms.  We were overlooking the Excel so had no view but that wasn,t a problem as we were only there for a concert.  With no traffic it was lovely and quiet at night which made for a great nights sleep particularly as the bed was so comfortable. A quick couple of minutes walk to Custom House tube station and into Canary Wharf or the city very easily. We only had a shower and the bathroom was quite small but that didn't really matter as it was immaculate and the Molten Brown toiletries a bonus.  We had a cocktail in the bar before going out and would love to go back again in the summer when we could take full advantage of the deck etc.  We would love to go back!  We stay in many hotels throughout the year, normally 4/5 star, for work and pleasure.  We have never had a phone call to the room to check if everything was ok, its the little touches like this that make the difference.  Many thanks",5,2015,12,15
119,Winter weekend break ,"Great location, friendly and helpful staff. Clean tidy a fantastic experience, I wouldn't hesitate to recommend the Sunborn to family and friends.
My wife and I stayed for the weekend to celebrate our anniversary, the yacht could not be faulted clean tidy helpful staff couldn't ask for more. We never ate on-board as we had had booked a trip round the Olympic Park and the Jack the Ripper tour and it was a little expensive but not silly money that said the breakfast was a bit much at £20 so we used the airline cafe a 2 minute walk away.",5,2015,12,15
119,Fantastic Stay,We stayed at this Yacht Hotel for 1 night on a Saturday which was a romance package for my birthday.  We arrived early from our drive up where we parked at the Excel centre which cost us £15 and a short walk to the hotel.  Our room was an executive river view which was lovely clean and large.  Dinner was included and the food was excellent.   The only thing that spoilt it for me was the fact there was a party of 6 and one of the gentlemen was very very loud and annoying.  Breakfast in the morning was superb.   If we are in the area again we will stay here,5,2015,12,15
119,An Unexpected Find,"London is not a cheap place for hotels at any time of year and price is not always matched with quality. The Sunborn Hotel is a mini cruise ship moored next to Excel in the London Docklands close to the DLR. I booked through a well known online resource and achieved a great deal in comparison with some of the more basic 'chain' hotels. The cabin (suite) was superb with its own small balcony overlooking the dock. i was only over-nighting and had an early departure so didn't have time to enjoy the included breakfast, but have no reason to doubt it would be good. Although out of the city centre, the DLR is only a short walk away with the Tower Gateway about 10-15 minutes ride which links with the London Underground. I would say allow 25-30 minutes to the West End. About the same time as from Hammersmith or Greenwich. It is however excellently placed for the Excel Conference Centre and, of course, London City Airport in the next dock along. This is a touch of class for a realistic (City of London) price.",5,2015,12,15
119,Amazing,Amazing hotel. Loved everything about it. Would recommend to anyone. The room had everything you could want including a coffee machine. The location is easy to get too and the o2 is in view. I will definitely be staying here again with my fiancée ,5,2015,12,15
119,Christmas present trip,"As my husband and I love being aboard a boat this seemed like the ideal Christmas present and an unusual 'hotel stay'. As we stepped out of the lift we were met with the opulence of an enormous crystal chandelier and immaculate area where the front desk was situated. Once checked in, our accommodation was as spectacular with the cherry wood furniture and deep velvety carpet giving the feel of sheer luxury. Our cabin overlooked the Excel exhibition centre and in the distance other hotels and restaurants. We were not disturbed by any noise from inside or out. We are so impressed as soon as we arrived home I have booked a night for next year.",5,2015,12,13
119,Amazing Hotel,Luxurious hotel.  WOW factor as soon as you walk in.  Very big rooms.  Great amenities.  Very comfortable and quiet.  Didn't hear any noise in the night.  All the staff were so friendly and seemed like they cared.,5,2015,12,12
119,"A great experience, just like a cruise ship.","The room was exceptional, we had a balcony overlooking the River Thames. The bathroom only had a showe but was spacious and had under floor heating. If you've not had a cruise before, I would truly recommend spending a night onboard to get the feeling of what it's like. The views from the yacht, especially on a night, are quite beautiful. The staff were excellent and couldn't do enough for you. The restaurant was superb, food excellent. The location was great, within 100m of the Excel NEC and with good transport links. Both Custom House and Prince Regent DLR stations were within easy walking distance, there are also bus routes nearby.  London City Airport is also nearby, and although the yacht is under the flight path, we weren't bothered by any excessive noise. The Emirates Cable Car across the Thames is also within easy reach, and can be seen from the hotel. Several restaurants nearby, Chinese, Indian, and English qusine.",5,2015,12,12
119,Among the most unusual hotels I have ever been!,"I have been a guest in dozens of hotels across the globe, and I rank this in my top 5 of unusual places to be: a yacht in London. Yes, a real genuine yacht anchored on Thames! It is different than any other hotel I have been, in the good and the bad.

Rooms are comfortable and reasonably large. Mine was facing Thames with a large window and  a small balcony, better view than other side facing the dock. Bathroom is functional but tiny and not nice-looking. I *LOVED* the double power outlets, UK and European (Shuco/Siemens). You can have a wonderful view of London skyline from the hall in the back (behind check-in desk) and from the restaurant upstairs. 

Access is a bit boring, as there are just two tiny elevators not very fast. DLR station is a short walk away, 2 stops (10 minutes) from London Bridge tube station. And, if you would have an event at London Excel, it is the closest hotel: just get out, ramp up the stairs and you are in (North entrance).",4,2015,12,12
119,Excellent,"We've stayed here twice now and booked to come again next year. 
The staff are really friendly, polite and helpful.
The rooms are lovely, very clean and spacious. 
Excellent service and pleasant stay. 
Location is good, near the 02, so can get the cable car across to use the underground or just jump on the DLR. Right next to the Excel so handy for exhibitions. We are at in the 02, but there is restaurants around that look good. 
Would recommend. ",5,2015,12,11
119,Touch of class,"Stayed here to go to the 02 Arena, before I had visited for business but this time was for pleasure, as ever the staff were Superb. Fabulous room, spacious quiet and so easy to get to the concert, went by the Emirates Sky ride. Cant fault my stay in anyway and have booked already again for my next business trip.",5,2015,12,11
119,Thoroughly enjoyed - great service - beautiful accommodation. An excellent experience.,"It was a shame to have to check out, this morning, (from a King room, with balcony, river view), after thoroughly enjoying three nights duration (would have preferred to have stayed longer) in this wonderful yacht Hotel. Everything was superb. The rooms, and communal areas were all lovely, well decorated, clean, and comfortable. The staff were all polite and efficient, and the front desk (particularly Maryiam) were happily accommodating of every task, and extremely helpful answering any query about the surrounding area etc. - we also really enjoyed travelling upon the Emirates Cable Car (Air-Line) and the Thames Clipper river boats. Wonderful experiences, to be repeated. Thank you, all, at the Sunborn London, and well done - we very much appreciated your efforts and professional services.",5,2015,12,11
119,Christmas Mumford & Sons,"Fab location, great style, comfortable bed and attentive staff. Close to Emirates Cable Car which was a great experience too and the concert at the O2 was awesome. Late night room service was speedy and bridged the gap between dinner and breakfast. Well worth the experience.",5,2015,12,11
119,Fancy Dinner,"In this location, you will definitely find harmonious atmosphere, staff very attentive and friendly, lovely views, fabulous food, luxurious and accessible.

It was a unique experience with my friends in London.",5,2015,12,10
119,Stunning,"This hotel was superb, staff were amazing and professional, we didn't stay for breakfast as had to leave early, but the restaurant looked fabulous, will definitely stay here again.

Would recommend every time.",5,2015,12,10
119,Superb and a great location,"We stayed here on our Anniversary, it was a different experience, with a touch of luxury. 

The bar restaurant couldn't do enough for us, really great service and food.  It is in an excellent location not far from the emirates crossing to the O2 (which unusually didn't run as it was high winds).

It makes a change and is more personalised that the standard hotel brands that sit along the docks, treat yourself its around the same price range.  My only regret is we didn't book a spa treatment before we arrived - book yours in advance to enjoy the whole ambience of this luxury floating hotel.

Oh and the hotel provide you with access to a tablet in the room to view its facilities and enjoy the free wifi should you want to catch up on you emails.",5,2015,12,09
119,A different experience ,Would def recommend a visit here as it makes for a different experience.  Some of the meeting rooms are very different and take a little getting used to but once you do it's great.  Food also good.  Lovely room though bathroom not up to same standard.  General bar and reception area is stunning ,4,2015,12,08
119,Dinner at the restaurant,"Beside a very beautiful view from the restaurant and a perfect service, the food was amazing. We had an a la carte menu, everything was so good, I still feel that apple pecan taste in my mounth : ) Congrats to the chef!",5,2015,12,07
119,A unique London Hotel,"Came across this hotel more by luck than judgement during a web search and didn't immediately realise what it was. Very glad we did though as it proved to be ideal for our needs as well as providing top quality accommodation at a very reasonable rate. 
We stayed as part of our belated 30th wedding anniversary celebration and although I knew where we were going my wife had no idea and was very surprised to find herself on a super-yacht. We were warmly welcomed and then offered a free upgrade to complement the occasion. My thanks to the staff, especially Nazma, for sorting this out. It was much appreciated. Of course we never got to experience our original room ( a classic king room with dock view) but I'm pretty sure it would have met the excellent standards of comfort and cleanliness we did enjoy. The Breakfast was very good value and again of excellent quality. I can only assume the evening meals would be so as well as we were out until late. The hotel is definately worth staying at, something a bit out of the ordinary and definitely with more character than the surrounding 'boxes' of competing hotel chains. There are good transport links with the DLR just 5 minutes walk away, with that in turn linking to the Jubilee line for fast access to central London or the O2 if the Emirates Airline cable car is closed, A few minutes in the opposite direction is the Olympic Park and stadium. If you are visiting an event at EXCEL then this venue is literally on the doorstep, or if you want an overnight stop when travelling from City Airport then look no further. We look forward to a return visit at some stage.",5,2015,12,07
119,Good experience,Hotel has a great atmosphere. A few times the ceilings look a bit cheap. The view is great and it is very easy to travel from and to with public transport. Entrance is a bit weird with the small elevators. 1 was out of order the entire stay.,4,2015,12,07
119,fantastic weekend,"Fantastic hotel, rooms huge, very clean, staff very nice, very nice area with lots of bars and restaurants, excellent transport into central London, beds extremely comfortable, cannot fault anything and would highly recommend, will be returning",5,2015,12,06
119,One of the best,"From start to finish, wonderful stay.  The staff were friendly and helpful, the room was one of the best we've stayed in, especially liked the information being on a tablet besides the kingsize bed.  An extra luxury being the Lavazza coffee machine (but no biscuits!!)  We were on the second floor (just above ground level) looking out onto the dock but we were amazed at how quiet it was.  The breakfast is a bit expensive £19 per person and of course the drinks on the dear side too, but we had one just to sit in the lounge",5,2015,12,06
119,"Very friendly staff, good suites.","We stayed here for a night prior to going to a concert at the O2. Unfortunately, the cable car from Excel to the O2 stopped just before we were due cross due to high winds, so we had to catch a cab instead.

The ship is very well presented, we had drinks at the bar but not dinner so can't comment of that but breakfast was excellent, clean, well cooked, plenty to choose from and very polite staff.

I was very impressed with the reception staff who seemed to go above and beyond to make you feel welcomed, my particular respects to Meri who checked us in and out with great professionalism and to Nazma who afforded me the time and with whom I enjoyed a wonderful conversation during the evening. They are a credit to Sunborn and make a difference to the usual hotel stay.

We enjoyed our experience very much and will return again for our events at Excel and for concerts at the O2.",4,2015,12,04
119,What a wonderful base for Excel,"Stayed for business whilst attending a conference at Excel. It was lovely - the staff were great, inspite of being fully booked, the room and facilities exceeded my expectations and it was the first ""conference hotel"" that I have ever been sorry to leave. Also worth noting is that the soundproofing is great - my room was very close to the Sky Lounge, which was being used for a number of evening events, but there was no noise from the lounge at all once in the room.",5,2015,12,04
119,Fantastic Yacht with Fantastic Team!!,"Upon arrival and Reception Team being told of my illness, I was upgraded to a deluxe cabin #44. The whole team of staff couldn't have been more helpful! So much so, that my friends are treating me again for my Birthday in Mid-January....",5,2015,12,03
119,Amazing Experience !!! Treated like Royalty!!!,This is an amazing hotel!!! The manager had upgraded our room as a nice surprise for my Husbands 40th birthday.  We stayed here for two nights and enjoyed the whole experience.  Had a whole afternoon drinking champagne on the bar terrace with views of Canary Wharf and the Emirates sky rides in the distance - will definitely go back without a doubt.,5,2015,12,02
119,Fabulous,"I stayed here Sunday night and  wish it had been a lot longer. Everything is bright shiny and luxurious, the staff in the fabulous reception area are friendly and welcoming our room was larger than most hotel rooms with comfy setee and beds crisp white linen and plump pillows towelling robes and slippers. A fast boil kettle and a coffee machine. The ensuite is large with walk in shower fluffy towels and good quality toiletries. We ate a very good evening meal in the bar at a window seat and were lucky next morning in the restaurant to again be seated at the window where we enjoyed probably the best breakfast I have had in any hotel. I cannot wait to return",5,2015,12,01
119,Luxury London destination with a difference,"I stayed with friends for the night on the Sunborn, a luxury yacht hotel, ideal for the O2 and Excel and good transport links into the centre of the city.  We were made to feel very welcome from the second we arrived, a 'wow' from my friends (fairly critical) 9 year old as we entered the reception area from the lift access from the dock was a very good start.  Very friendly helpful staff, checked our bags in ahead of time so we didn't have to lug them round London.  Food was reasonably priced and very well presented, drinks were 'London prices' but a reasonable range.  Large well equipped rooms, much larger than other London hotels I've stayed in for considerably more money, in fact our two room rates were no more that those of a Premier Inn, with the bonus of being on a yacht.  Breakfast was a bargain, half price between 7 and 9am on Sunday morning, £7.50 for a full range of continental and traditional buffet options and kids eat free.  Well worth the money for a stay to remember, in a good location and luxurious surroundings, highly recommended.",5,2015,12,01
119,"Great Place, novel idea, perfect position, all round a good stay","Stayed for one night B&B to visit the O2.
Great staff, check in was easy, baggage storage before check in and after checking out was efficient and very good.
The boat is fabulous inside and out. The rooms are very comfortable and well appointed. The breakfast was good in a large and pleasant dining room with complimentary papers.
The niggles were...........
Toiletries were of good quality but fairly basic in what was available. The mini bar hid complimentary water which you wont find unless you raid the bar!! Only two tea bags but many different types. No little biscuit!
The breakfast was good except it tool four pots of tea and our insistence that they put more than one tea bag in for four people, before we got a drinkable cuppa!!

So easy to get to the DLR and there are bars and restaurants all around.",4,2015,12,01
119,Romantic Birthday,"Amazing place! We went as a couple for my boyfriend's birthday last week. The place is absolutely amazing! The staff were great, the room was very big and clean. The place was so peaceful and the view was outstanding! I absolutely loved it. We only stayed for one night but I can't wait to go again. Best hotel in London and it's just a different experience. Definitely recommend it! :)",5,2015,12,01
119,Afternoon Tea.,"I visited the lands end restaurant in the hotel for champagne afternoon tea. I really enjoyed the experience as although I've had better afternoon tea, this was a really different setting. We had a window seat and the view was beautiful. A vast selection of teas were available, I went for the citrus mint, which was nice and my partner went for the pear tea, again very nice. The selection of sandwiches were good, however the bread was slightly stale. Cakes, and scones were great. The staff were very attentive and friendly! The restaurant décor is very nice and it is clean, and well kept, as is the rest of the hotel from what we saw). I really enjoyed it and I would like to return and book a room for the night.",4,2015,11,30
119,Daughter's 18th,"Amazing beautiful clean luxurious room. Staff very attentive and friendly. They pulled out all the stops to give my daughter the royal treatment for her 18th birthday. There was a lovely handwritten letter with her chocolates and Happy Birthday in chocolate with her evening meal. My daughter and her partner have returned home raving about the positive experience. She says she will cherish the memories made here forever, no mother could want more for this momentous occasion. Thank you with all my heart for doing so much to make this trip perfect for her. I'm so grateful and highly recommend the Sunbornlondon for anyone wanting a luxurious break!",5,2015,11,30
119,"Unique, luxurious hotel",We stayed here for 2 nights. Yacht was luxurious throughout. Our suite was very large in comparison to some high market hotels. Staff very helpful and friendly. Very centrally located for o2 arena and Excel London. Close rail links. Definitely recommend and we will return to this hotel.,5,2015,11,30
119," Beautiful, unique and friendly","The hotel itself is beautiful and sat on the Thames - perfect for tourists and visitors to the O2. The reception and customer service was helpful and friendly making us feel very welcome. There was no parking but we easily found alternative parking a short walk away via the ""just park"" website (booked and paid for in advance). 

We were able to drop our bags early as we were going to a show at the O2. When we came back we were directed to our room and we found our bags there waiting for us. 

The room was a good size considering it's a boat! The bed was two joined twins but a good size and the only complaint was they were quite hard but that's down to personal preference. The bathroom was clean and toiletries good quality. The minibar wasn't stocked (not that we ever use them) but if you wanted room service you could order it on the tablet in the room. Television  was a good size and there was a balcony. We didn't have the best view as we were dockside (slightly cheaper tickets) but there were chairs and would be a nice feature in the summer.

The best part of the experience was the food! It seems pricey but is definitely worth it - we were full with just a main each and a shared side so it ended up not too expensive. The drinks weren't so good as they only offer wine and a small selection of spirits although they did manage to rustle up a bottle of becks when we asked. We decided to have breakfast too as they offered us an early bird deal meaning we paid £7.50 each instead of £12.50. It was a buffet but the food was really lovely and there was tons of choice! We left feeling well fed and happy! 

Overall a relaxing and high quality experience - we would definitely come back and highly recommend.",5,2015,11,30
119,Amazing!,"What a fantastic experience, a beautiful hotel on the water. Rooms are spacious well appointed with everything you could want. The staff are attentive and friendly. The afternoon tea was great, plenty of food and of good quality, more food was supplied as required. It is situated on the DLR which means it is well easy to access  places in London. We took the Thames Clipper from the pier at the London Eye to the O2 and the Cable Car from there to the Hotel, this was a brilliant way to arrive. All in all this is one experience I would do again and again. Highly recommended.",5,2015,11,29
119,Concert stay,This is a very good hotel with a very service minded and helpfull staff. The Sunborn is really worth the experience and are good for a romantic trip. We stayed at the lower deck and there was quite a lot of noise early in the morning due to delivery. ,4,2015,11,29
119,What a refreshing change,"What a different experience compared to the tedious hotels that are so common. Comfortable, spacious rooms, friendly and helpful staff, fabulous bar area, probably the best breakfast I've had in a hotel - they clearly put real effort and pride into food compared to the very lazy approach of the hotel chains. 
Well done to all there for doing something different, it's the way hotels and their staff should be. ",5,2015,11,28
119,"As a regular business and private hotel user in London, this is by far the best accomodation ever.",I arranged for an overnight stay and one night is not enough! The standard of room and staff attention to detail was splendid and I will certainly book here again. As a business and private traveller I have stayed in many hotels over the years. My old favourite for a personal trip was the Savoy but I now have a new favourite!,5,2015,11,28
119,Special occasion,"Great place to stay, good location , great food. Brilliant place to relax and undwimd after a busy day of shopping in London.

Staff very helpful , couldn't do enough to help , excellent food in great surrondings",5,2015,11,28
119,A tinge of luxury; a small change from the regular properties,"It's a real boat that you'll be staying in; not a lookalike or somewhere in land. It's a boat that's moored along the river. The foyer has a pleasing look to it. A lift (albeit with confusing floor numbers) will take you to the reception. The place really gives you feeling you are inside a boat. 

Although, if you think you'll feel the movements and water splashing (or the sickness?) you're expecting a little too much. 

Off to the rooms, be careful again to ask for a room that has a view. Otherwise - as it happened in my case - you'll end up with a window staring a concrete wall. That'll just be plain .. blah. A colleague of mine got one with a view and that was nice. It's right by the waterway and its pleasing. The rooms are spacious, well carpeted and have a nice ambience to them. Another point to note here is the strange placement of the television. It's neither positioned to offer a good view from the bed nor from the couch. At least in the room I was staying at. 

Out to the restaurant, I could really not try the spread in the menu because we had booked a corporate package. Although, the breakfast was functional. I would liked a little more choice in terms of items - some more meat choices or even cuisines. 

The bar is quite large, opens to the rear end of the boat and offers a fantastic view of London. And if you are on a warm evening, you will enjoy the view along with a couple of beers.",4,2015,11,27
119,"What an amazing evening, it could'nt have been any better","My husband booked this overnight stay, as a surprise for our wedding anniversary.
From the moment i saw this hotel i was so excited,. The hotel had upgraded us to an executive suite, the room was beautiful, very clean with crisp white bedding, the shower was lovely, the restaurant was perfect with white linen table cloths, the service excellent, and when i tasted the food it was superb, the staff warm and friendly, the only down side was we had to leave the next morning. An amazing hotel, The whole yacht is beautiful, from the grand staircase to the most beautiful chandelier.
I would certainly recommend this beautiful hotel, and well done to all the staff for their hard work in making this a memorable anniversary for me, and look forward to returning soon Thank you
Christine P Essex",5,2015,11,26
119,Lovely treat,"Room was fantastic, bar and restaurant excellent such a lovely hotel with something just a little different ,  if I were to be disappointed it would be that room service didn't do our room and wouldn't have done if we hadn't asked at 6 in the evening for someone to clear the evening before a room service plates.  Otherwise fantastic",5,2015,11,25
119,Simply the best,"My husband, and I stayed at the sunborn last week with our son and his girlfriend. A truely fantastic experience!
Excellent location for the O2 and central London.
The rooms were beautifully appointed, spotlessly clean with lovely molton brown accessories,robes/slippers and an amazing coffee machine.
The staff were very friendly and accomodating-nothing was too much trouble for them.
Breakfast was excellent with a great choice of beautifully presented food.
The location and being on the yacht made it more special. The views over the river ,the O2 and London were amazing, especially at night. Sitting having a drink in the lounge with these amazing views at the end of the day was a little bit of luxury.
I didn't get the chance to use the SPA so we will definately being going back!
Thank you all from the Mires family.

",5,2015,11,25
119,LOVE IT,"I stayed at this hotel for a night when I travelled to see a gig at the O2. This is an absolutley fantastic hotels. The whole yatch is looks amazing from the entrance, to the receptions all the way to our room. The rooms are clean and beautiful with a wonderful view, specially at night. The staff are really friendly and helpful and attended to all my needs. The cocktails at the bar are exquisite. I honestly have NO complains. I would definitley be returning to this hotel in the future and I would highly recommend this hotel to anyone.",5,2015,11,24
119,nice treat,"This is a  lovely place to stay . We were offered a free room upgrade which was really nice . Cocktails were really nice , bit pricey but to be expected. Meal was really good quality . Breakfast was quite expensive but still good quality all though it could have been hotter !! Would definitely return",5,2015,11,23
119,A Nice stay,"This is my second time on the hotel. The staff are again very frendly and helpful. I was accommodated in a room on deck five with was a nice room but the view was limited to the Excel venue, not that it made much difference as it was dark when i got to my room. The food was nice and well prepared. I will be going again.",4,2015,11,22
119,Perfect for the Excel but give breakfast a miss,An original place to stay which in itself is hard to find. But this is original as well as luxurious.  My room was only a standard room as I knew I was arriving late in the evening so would not be spending long in the hotel. However this was superb with a large seating area as well as a queen size bed. The room was spacious with the window overlooking the river which looked nice at night with the lights from the other side of the harbour. I would recommend the accommodation for all kinds of stay from business to a spoil yourself break with your partner. Only bad point was the cost of the breakfast. I cannot justify paying £19.50 for what was on offer. Very average fare and very average service. This may be ok if you are on special treat but if you are visiting the Excel pop into there early and get breakfast for less than half the price,5,2015,11,22
119,Excellent hotel,"Excellent hotel, great concept to stay on a boat. Location is ideal for 02, lovely views, staff are so helpful and restaurant and bar great. Would book again as its near to stations, nothing to improve on........................................",5,2015,11,21
119,Lovely hotel with a great price!,"Great location for the O2 or ExCel. Lovely hotel with very helpful staff. 
Total cost to stay here was so much cheaper than other hotels in the same area and we were not disappointed! Our room overlooking the Dock, was spotlessly clean, luxury carpet and very spacious. 
Mital, on Reception, was very professional and helpful when checking us in. 
We didn't eat at the hotel but many restaurants nearby within walking distance. We had breakfast round the corner at Cafe Bonnane, which was lovely and a great price at £5.95. 
Cable car to get to O2, DLR and Tube easy to use. 
Would definitely recommend this hotel/yacht to others and stay here again. 
Thank you to the Sunborn for a lovely stay. ",5,2015,11,21
119,Afternoon Tea,"A huge thank you to the team on board for a fantastic afternoon tea for my mum's 50th birthday a few weeks back.  The hotel is fabulous, food was delicious and the staff were attentive, friendly and couldn’t have done enough for us.
Cant wait to visit again soon",5,2015,11,20
119,Affordable fantastic experience,"A huge thank you to the sunborn hotel just taken my mum and daughter for 2 nights at the sunborn ,we had a fabulous time visiting london and the highlight being our  stay on this lovely yacht .great hospitality and rooms ,coffee machines and tablets nothing too much trouble once again a big fat thank you we hope to see you again soon",5,2015,11,19
119,Amazing Experience - Well worth a visit,"Really easy to find, parking close by. Luxury experience with exceptional standards. Reception and all staff superb - couldn't do enough for you. Mari at the front desk was polite, informative and couldn't be more helpful. We will be going again.",5,2015,11,19
119,Excellent place to stay,This hotel is unusual being a high quality yacht located next to the Excel. Room we stayed in was on level 2 with views of the dock. Could not fault the finish or cleanliness on arrival. Dining is expensive for standard meals but the service could not be faulted. The staff were all very attentive. The post code is misleading and sent us in the wrong direction on two different navigation aids - a better description is Queen Victoria square  E16 or look for Novotel and this location is next door. DLR is 3 minutes walk away (customs house) and there are numerous eateries nearby. Ideal for O2 and Excel or for a London weekend. No parking on site and local car parks expensive (use just park.com).,5,2015,11,17
119,"Super, would definitely stay again","We stayed for one night and as we were attending a concert in the O2, we wanted to stay closeby.  I would not hesitate in staying again, it's a lovely luxurious experience.  beautiful rooms, we were on deck 1 and I believe this was what they called a classic room.  We had beautiful shower room, and our room was spotless and spacious,  the reception, entrance, corridors and bar etc are all spotless and are of high quality.  One small negative, and there is only one, our room was very warm, so if you are a ""warm"" person you might find this too.  If we attend any more concerts at the O2 we would definitely return.  A fabulous alternative to staying in a hotel.",5,2015,11,17
119,"great room, food iffy",Stayed for the second time and will return for conferences at ExCel. But breakfast is far too expensive and food in the restaurant is dull in general and the staff are not really engaged. You can only blame the management. The rooms are superb and there are plenty of nearby eating establishments. Shame that the food lets down what is otherwise an excellent place to stay.,4,2015,11,15
119,Amazing experience,My daughter and I stayed here when we went to see Neil Diamond at the O2 in August. It was fabulous ...I loved every minute of it. I felt like royalty ....it was so luxurious. The staff were very helpful and pleasant .I would definitely recommend to anyone.,5,2015,11,15
119,Saturday night,"My fiancé and I stayed last night, it was lovely, staff were very friendly and the room was very nice.  Although we never had dinner onboard it did smell lovely.  There is no movement from the ship that i could feel even though the weather outside was pretty bad, Would recommend it to anyone",4,2015,11,15
119,Amazing experience!,The staff were very friendly and inviting. The room was plush and made for a great nights sleep in a very comfortable bed. It made a great change from a standard hotel. An experience not to be passed up. An absolute must.,5,2015,11,14
119,Deserves 6 out of 5,"What a wonderful, unique, luxurious treat! I took a client to watch the rugby at the Olympic Park so we stayed here. It was cheaper than some of the budget brands in central London but so much better, just because it isn't quite in central London.It's only 15 minutes on the DLR  I loved the views both from the rooms (mine was on the same level as reception, my client's was higher up so was a bit smaller) and the restaurant/bar. We had some nice food (a meze plate) before heading out for the rugby. We came back for some lovely cocktails - not cheap but oh so good! Breakfast was varied and good quality. Staff were courteous and efficient. I can't wait to come back!!",5,2015,11,12
119,Bullseye Birthday,"A top rate experience. Go if you can. 

I stayed as part of a special birthday and chose the riverside view; it was a small
Surcharge on the regular room rate but the Sunrise over the docks makes it worth every extra penny.

My tip : arrive by Emirates Airlines chairlift (tube @ North Greenwich) at her than DLR. it's much more memorable as an arrival than DLR. by all means leave via DLR if you like.

Rooms are of an excellent standard. Food package is good value and breakfast very good too.

I loved it and wanted to sail somewhere. It's ace. You won't be disappointed. ",5,2015,11,12
119,Super Sunborn,"Stayed on board this fantastic floating hotel, as we were going to one of the U2 concerts at the O2. As we approached the hotel, we were amazed by it's size and it just looked so impressive. From the moment we walked in, the staff were so friendly and welcoming. After checking in, we went to the bar ordered a nice bottle of Pinot, then sat out on the rear deck taking in the amazing views, the O2 looked so impressive across the Thames and this hotel is perfectly placed if your going there. The buffet breakfast was delicious and although it was quite expensive, we certainly got our money's worth. The train and tube links are very close and it was so easy to get around from here, the Emirates air line is also well worth a trip over the Thames and it's only a 5 minute walk away. We intend to visit London again next year and this is the first hotel we will look at staying in. Thanks to all the staff on board.",5,2015,11,12
119,Lovely and comfy,"We stayed here for 2 nights, the place is very lovely, clean and comfortable.
The staff are very friendly and helpful, they couldn't do enough for us.

We only had the breakfast the once, quite expensive if you consider what is around the hotel, but the quality and service again was excellent.

The room was fab, comfy bed and decent bathroom. Radio using the TV worked quite well. We only had the basic room, very good though.

Outside the hotel there are a few places to eat, we ate in one of the local cafe for breakfast and the nearby Tapa restaurant one evening, both very good indeed. I believe the on-board restaurant is very good though, we just wanted a change as we were visiting London from the North West of England.

Overall, excellent place to stay, we would stay here again.",4,2015,11,12
119,Shocking Service  - lack of any form of customer service,"1. Apart from a relatively well proportion room and bathroom (the Aloft is comparable) that's about as far as it goes in praise
2. Breakfast was ok but at £19.50 was excessive as it wasn't brilliant quality, the breads were stale, the mushrooms were soggy
3. The rooms had paper thin walls, so could hear the antics of the couple next door for most of the night
4.  Do not have any form of accident or require any form of first aid as they do not care.  Whilst aboard a gentleman was taken ill (not with our party) and they had no first aid on board and to be honest when an ambulance was required were about as helpful as chocolate teapots. When you have to step in quickly yourself with limited first aid training and ask for a first aider to get a box of Elastoplast is not the appropriate response to what could have been a critical situation (and did not involve a wound)  What's more the response back when I complained to Andreas the GM via email the next day, the staff failed to send the response through to him and lacked any form of acknowledgement or care..... its how orgaisations respond to this that makes the difference in service.  God forbid a bigger issue on the boat - its probably a good job its moored. 

By the way I stay regularly in accommodation during business trips.   I have never seen any organisation with so little in terms of customer service.  Honestly shocking.  The other reviews you read my be good to excellent - I can only assume they were all in good health.",1,2015,11,12
119,Unique and Luxurious - Treat Yourself!,"If you love boats and being on the water then look no further. I was attending WTM and the Sunborn Yacht is mere steps away from the Regent entrance, so great location for my purposes.

From when I stepped onto the boat (via elevator btw) and arrived in the reception, I could tell that no expense had been spared in terms of the finishes. Similarly, the room was very well appointed. I especially liked the coffee pod machine as I'm a bit of a coffee snob and the strength of the free WiFi was fantastic even though I was right at the back on the top floor.

I had several meetings in the main bar/bistro and dinner in the restaurant and I can say that the quality and presentation of the food was beyond my expectation. I found the staff to be very professional, courteous and attentive.

I would highly recommend a stay at the Sunborn. I certainly will be staying here again next year.",4,2015,11,12
119,"Deluxy, great, fascinating hotel & restaurant!","Ideal place to stay when you go to the WTM or any fair/exibition at the Excel in London. Very nice inside, very confortable, very nice & helpull staff! I highly recommend it for people who want to save time and enjoy the luxury of a stay on a deluxe yacht hotel",5,2015,11,12
119,Lovely weekend away,"A fantastic idea! The sunborn is truely lovely. All the rooms are a fabulous size and you could easily stay for more than a couple of nights. Looks beautiful inside and out and with good weather the deck would be incredible. The reception service was perfect. Bar service for both food and drink was sadly slow and also sub standard incomparison to the welcome service we received. That being said it did not ruin our stay or the food/ drink we consumed. 

A must stay if staying in this part of the city. A good 40 mins into central London on the dlr and tube but get an uber back (if in the evening) as this will only cost you about £20.",4,2015,11,11
119,"Lovely hotel, nice and central","We tried this hotel (yacht) instead of the normal Hilton hotel just to say we tried somewere else. We were very impressed with the place, even though as it was a yacht, once under the affluence of incohol, some of the sea steps were tricky.
Rooms were very comfortable and well appointed and we had a lovely view across the dock.
There are some very nice eateries in the vicinity and the dockland light railway is very close so touring is easy
The price was surprisingly good for the level of appointment, dulled slightly by a daft bottle only ordering from the room service (who wanted £180 for a bottle of Russian Standard vodka) though the local late night supermarket was still open so we bought the same bottle for £18, so all was well with the world.
I do recommend this hotel, just not the night bar.",4,2015,11,11
119,"""Unique and Welcoming hotel""","Just returned from a one night stay on the Sunborn Yacht Hotel London to celebrate our 30th Wedding Anniversary. From the moment we were welcome on board the staff were courteous, pleasent and professional. The ambience of this hotel is truely spectaculare!
We were allocated an executive cabin with river view. The standard was exceptional... spotless, spaceous and extremaly comfortable! 
Location is ideal for O2, we attended the Blues festival and took the cable-car to the venue. A must... with great views of Canery wharf.
All in all our stay was delightful, we will certainly be returning with our two children to enjoy the experience as a family.
The hotel is Unique but it is the staff that make your stay so special!",5,2015,11,10
119,Excellent Weekend !!!,"Went to celebrate my Dads 60th and had an excellent time. The yacht was spotless, rooms were modern and spacious and the staff were first class. Went for dinner in the evening and the food was faultless, relaxed after dinner with a few brandies and then had a terrific nights sleep. Breakfast was by far the best buffet breakfast I've had for some time (and I do stay away a lot with work) and when we checked out Romao Catrapona was a pleasure to deal with. All in all, I thoroughly recommend staying here for the evening.",5,2015,11,09
119,incredable,"We only stayed one night sadly; the ship is really a floating hotel and at least five star. The staff were friendly, helpful and organised. I think there are one hundred and twenty eight cabins, all to the same standard. Our cabin was fantastic, big bed loads of room and clean. In truth the whole ‘boat’ is beautiful I would love to stay there again. We ate out for our evening meal but breakfast was buffet, with everything one could want, cooked and presented to a high standard. 
My only gripe, the price of drinks in the bar are a joke. It cost over twelve pounds for two halves of lager. I know London can be expensive but the bar was empty. When the staff outnumber the guests something is wrong. Everyone I spoke to had only bought one drink and gone to the shop over the road for drinks to have in their rooms. That is a shame as the bar area was very nice and I would have loved to stayed on board to have a few drinks.",5,2015,11,09
119,An original alternative,"I stayed at the Sunborn Yacht for 3 nights in a business suite on the upper floor. The Yacht is luxurious although a bit on the kitch side. Staff are competent and friendly. The breakfast buffet is good except for the juices that could have been freshly squeezed instead of bought over the counter, especially for the orange juice (it is advertised as freshly squeezed in the room service menu too but isn't what it says).
The room had a nice view on the dock with balcony. The hitch is that between 7 AM and 10 PM you are situated right under the approach of London City Airport, it's bearable with window closed but you do wake up at 7 AM without wake-up call.
The heating in my room was not working and the room temperature was 18,5ºC so I asked that Maintenance to fix it. On  my return on the second nothing had changed. On my third day a heatwave hit me when I came to my room in the evening, I first thought the heater had been fixed but no, it was the AC that had been turned up to 35ºC.
I think this was a payback from Maintenance seeing they have to purge the whole system they preferred to play a little joke on a paying customer. Not appreciated",4,2015,11,09
119,great stay,"The yacht is great. Lovely clean rooms. We had room 2027 which had twin beds, a settee large wardrobe and although on the dock side we had a great view of Comic con when we stayed! Lovely bed linen,Molton Brown toiletries. Tablets in the rooms.staff all very helpful and friendly.emirates cable cars close for crossing the river to the o2.cant wait to return.",5,2015,11,09
119,Fantastic Birthday Surprise,"My Boyfriend booked a Surprise for my Birthday, we stayed from the 5th - 7th November. This is one of the best Hotels I have ever stayed in, the Staff were so friendly and helpful, the Hotel Entrance is beautiful and we stayed in an Executive Kingsize with a Sea View which was fantastic, so clean and just overall perfect. The location is perfect if you're going to a gig at the o2 which we did and I could not fault anything. We had a meal in the Restaurant which was superb and I even received a little Birthday treat which was some Chocolate Truffles on a slate plate with ""Happy Birthday"" written in Caramel sauce, what a lovely little gesture! Would definitely stay and eat here again as it was wonderful.",5,2015,11,09
119,Amazing,"We booked the Sunborn Yatch for our Remembrance weekend.  The staff were very efficient and polite. Nothing was too much trouble. The yatch its self was spotless, everything shone. Our room was a great size with all you could need and more, all furnishing were of a very high standard. The security on board was very good, bedroom key cards were needed to get around the yatch. Breakfast was plentyful, the only down side was the cooked breakfast wasnt hot.  We pointed this out to a waiter and he offered to get us a fresh one from the kitchen.  We then saw several staff members trying to rectify the problem.
We hope to stay here again as we really enjoyed it.",5,2015,11,08
119,Fantastic stay,"we have just returned from a nights stay , the staff are so attentive and polite , the food was fantastic and the room was lovely. We will definitely stay again. 

The room had its own tablet, and coffee machine. 

Breakfast seemed expensive but was worth it what a choice & quality.

Really close to the DLR and the Emirates thing so made getting in to town easy.

",5,2015,11,08
119,Unique hotel,"We stayed for two nights at the Sunborn whilst attending an event at Greenwich.
Driving across London on a busy Saturday too, longer than anticipated but it was easy to draw up outside and access this floating hotel.     No car parking here but in a nearby car park.
Spacious layout and rooms. All luxurious and well planned.
We did not specify the position of the room and looked towards the dockside. On a future visit, we would request an upper floor with views across the water.
Helpful staff.      Generous breakfast, served on our Sunday until 12 which was helpful ( this may have been a special arrangement for our party however)
Easy walk down to the Emirates gondola which took us across the Thames to the O2 area.   Trains, buses, tube and river boats to all parts of the city and beyond from here.",5,2015,11,08
119,Great Experience ,"Wonderful time, great customer service. Lovely scenery, everything was peaceful. 
Hotel itself does not have a car park, but it has a car park literally 5 mins walking distance which was great. Also emirates cable car was 5 mins walking distance, loved it.
Only issue was the heating in the room, it was ever so hot. But nothing we couldn't live with.",5,2015,11,08
119,Great stay ,"Was a lovely chilled atmosphere which was the intention of the trip to meet a good friend , pleasant staff with a pleasant greeting to our room , will most definetly stay again , the relaxing environment surrounding it also very inviting to stay with you again . Thankyou ",5,2015,11,06
119,Visit to London Docklands,"The only yacht hotel in London, moored in Royal Victoria Dock, East London. Very well appointed. All of the staff were very helpful, particularly those on reception.  Food of a good quality both for breakfast and evening meal. Although prices are a little high (London prices)it is well worth the visit for something different to the usual London hotels. Ask for a room looking out towards the dock, which we had, otherwise you will be staring at the warehouses that house the up and coming eateries in the area. You can see the O2, Shard, Gherkin, Emirates Airline etc from the waterside rooms. You are also in the flight path for the Airport and planes come in low over the dock preparing to land a few miles away - out on deck you can hear the approach but inside, no noise at all. In fact this adds to the experience - it did for me!!
This a developing area of London so it was a little quiet, particularly at night. Easy access to the Docklands Light railway which is only a 5 min. Walk away. The Emirates Airline is also very close, 5 mins away and this gives you access to the O2 and other parts South of the river, although you will need to get other transport - riverboat etc to get to other visitor attractions.J
Overall, a very good experience.",4,2015,11,06
119,u2 could feel like you're in u2!!,"we stayed onboard the Sunborn to attend the opening night of the U2 show at the o2 arena,the location is perfect for the arena,only a cable car ride over the river or a short train trip to the venue,on arriving the staff were extremely helpful and very friendly,the room was a great size with a view of the river and the o2 in the distance,we would fully recommend the Sunborn and will be hopefully returning soon.",5,2015,11,04
119,Super Stay on a super yacht!,"What can I say this place is really something unusual. How often to you get to stay on such an elegant vessel in central London. With access to the DLR and underground a stroll away and views of Canary Wharf, the o2 And Emirates cable cars it is the perfect way to have a luxurious stay on the Thames. There is ample parking in the excel centre a short while away and there are plenty of surrounding shops and restaurants if needed.

We found the staff really friendly and accommodating shifting our restaurant reservation back as we got stuck in bad traffic (it is London 😄). The restaurant was really good, top notch food quality, presentation and service. The lamb we had was really delightful. Breakfast the next day was really good also, great to get a view over the Thames from the glazed stern of the boat.

The room was really spacious and had a waterside porthole view, the bed was one of the most comfy I have every stayed in. All of the floors are key card access so very secure, although I would have liked to take a stroll around the upper decks.!

Needless to say I will be staying here again the wife has already recommend it to a co-worker who has booked to stay in December.",5,2015,11,02
119,Amazing place to stay.,"My friend & I stayed on the night of Oct 26th following the U2 concert at the O2 From the moment we checked in ( all reception staff very friendly & efficient  ) we were made to feel very welcome & nothing was too much trouble.We had cocktails at the deck bar as it was a lovely day & watched the sun go down.We also had a drink in the bar after the concert  even though  the bar was closed ( drinks quite expensive but to be expected as it is a hotel & it is London) we checked out late morning the following day , we had breakfast at a local restaurant as we thought the breakfast prices were expensive.Again the checkout was very efficient & friendly.This is a lovely hotel with courteous staff, lovely comfy rooms & furnishings , fabulous views & handy for amenities  & underground / dwr etc .I would highly recommend & hope to stay again. ",5,2015,11,02
119,"unusual and luxurious, great location","Moored in Victoria Dock this hotel looks and is fab. The breakfast and drinks are a bit pricey for us, but for a special one off stay it was a real treat.The service was really good, smart, friendly staff. The room was extremely comfortable. We were going to a concert at the O2 and it is well placed to get over on the skyline or by London transport.",4,2015,11,02
119,Unusual location but ideal if you think flexibly,"Chose this location as somewhere that would be easy to return to after a Friday night event at the Olympic Park.  Super friendly staff (with one exception), lovely accommodation and adequate eating.  Beware though if you intend more than a nightcap in the bar, best bring lots of money and all your credit cards - bar prices are usurious.",5,2015,11,02
119,The best place to stay in London,"We were there for one night to see U2 at the O2.  What a fantastic experience to stay on an immaculate yacht - great staff, great views and so peaceful! Yes, the food and drink is quite expensive but we really cannot fault the overall stay.",5,2015,11,02
119,Something different for London Hotel,"Had a very pleasant one night stay in this floating hotel. It was nice to experience a very different type of city hotel. The restaurant was not large so remember to book if you want to eat in. Food was excellent, and well presented but the price reflected this. Staff very friendly. Booking process was all a bit of a muddle, glad we had booking.com confirmation because what reception had was very different and not the rate we booked at. Having said this they sorted it and offered us a complimentary drink for all the confusion. If you have never cruised but want to get a feeling for what staying on a ship is like then this is a good place to experience it.
Just some friendly tips, 2 English Breakfast tee bags for a 24hr stay is not enough and a couple of biscuits would have been nice 😀 The bar area after dinner was a bit cold, so worth checking temperature is comfortable. 
I would definitely recommend this for a hotel with a difference....",4,2015,11,01
119,The best stay in London so fat,The staff was very friendly and boat was beautiful. Ideal location but still without the noise of being in central London. We went out for dinner but Breakfast was lovely. We are definitely going to book again. As an ex hotelier the hotel should be proud of its staff. Well done!,5,2015,11,01
119,One night stay for a concert at the 02,"Room was really nice, comfortable, big bed, really clean, no complaints. The cost of drinks and breakfast were just too much. In fact way too much. 2 drinks £15.59, breakfast £39.98 for 2. too expensive",3,2015,11,01
119,Bit of Luxury,"Had a great day we were fortunate to have the sun on that day so we sat out on the deck and had drinks. We enjoyed the lovely views of London, but as the sun went down  we went inside.  We had a simple snack and drinks  in the lounge, the waiter was welcoming and friendly but this time I found the food a bit of a let down.

But I still definitely recommend !!!!",4,2015,10,31
119,Amazing place to stay !!,"The service from start to finish throughout the stay was excellent ! We stayed for our anniversary and the staff and the hotel made it all a very memorable occasion . We had afternoon tea which was very good.
They had arranged for all the extras that I asked for to be in the room ie flowers champaign etc 
We couldn't fault anything and will  certainly be returning again and recommending it to our friends !!",5,2015,10,31
119,Fantastic ,We stayed here for 1 night whilst doing Jack the Ripper tour. We stayed in the executive room. It was very spacious and a bed you can get lost in lol...The staff were friendly and nothing was too much trouble. Unfortunately we didn't have a river view we had dock view but it wasn't too bad as comic con was on and we got to see people in there weird and wonderful costumes. My only gripe was wish they had bigger cups to drink my tea but I would definitely without a doubt stay here again. ,5,2015,10,31
119,Excellent stay,"Just come home from staying 1 night on this boat. Amazing place, staff very friendly and helpful! Room was lovely with a balcony overlooking the river (defiantly recommend a river view). Paid extra for breakfast which was well worth it. Really enjoyed our stay and will be recommending to friends and family. Many thanks ",5,2015,10,30
119,Fantastic base for O2 ,"We stayed here for 2 nights whilst going to the O2.  Our room, although one of the cheapest was spacious and the oversized bed was really comfortable.  The staff were all friendly and nothing was too much trouble.  The facilities and location are fantastic and a real treat.  The only downside was the coffee in the room, a decaf option would have been appreciated and a larger  cup to make tea in but other than that I really could not fault it. ",5,2015,10,30
119,Outstanding ,"I think this experience was just the best.
The room was good, reception and welcome excellent and restaurant service and staff outstanding.
I special thanks to our waitress Veronika whom was outstanding at her job and made us relaxed and knew her products and menu

We will definitely be back ",5,2015,10,30
119,Superb!,"Outstanding experience. Great rooms, quiet, spacious and dark at bedtime with large comfortable bed, a little warm but with a great view. Would have liked somewhere I can sit and do my makeup but otherwise first class. Excellent shower room, decent sized quality towels, nice toiletries, spotlessly clean. Breakfast was hot, fresh and delicious with lots of choice and a to die for view of the water. Service was outstanding throughout. Well placed for O2 and Excel and in the heart of where it's happening in Docklands. Recommended.",5,2015,10,30
119,Friendship from hotel staff,"Good location for businnes (Excel), excellent restaurant, very good room (bed, bathroom and wifi service) and friendship from desk and bar/restaurant attendants.
Easy access to transportation (metro and taxi).",5,2015,10,29
119,Birthday surprise,"Stayed for 1night on the 11th October 2015 ,had a family executive room with a river view lovely, staff friendly cannot fault it, booked through Expedia travel for a surprise for my daughter 15th birthday this was put on as a special request , but a slight disappointment that not a card or balloon was put in the room for her, Cannot comment on the food as we ate off the yatch at a Italian close by, there are plenty of restaurants close to the yatch,a great way to arrive was via the Emirates Cable Car amazing views as you travel across to the Sunborn yatch all in all we had a pleasant stay .",4,2015,10,27
119,Most amazing experience,"Was a surprise treat. It was amazing. Our room was on the 5th floor, very comfortable rooms and spacious.the bed was so comfortable. The decor and feel of the yacht felt like you was on holiday.
Staff were very helpful and friendly. Very nice and peaceful surroundings. Ideal for if you are travelling to the 02 with the skylines minutes away and underground. Would most definitely visit again.",5,2015,10,27
119,Very good choice,"I decide to make my husband a surprise for our wedding anniversary and I found this cool Yatchy Hotel at trip Advisor and decide, bingo! This is the one!! So we park the car at Royal Victoria car park near by. We had a drink at the bar and also I got help from the staff to arrange a surprise to my husband as he didn't have a clue we were spending the night. Very friendly staff, nice room(clean), the Yatchy is quite charming and more that I was expecting to be. We had such a lovely night and definitely coming back. A+ :))",5,2015,10,26
119,Overall the experience was DIFFICULT!,"When trying to book it is im possible to speak to anyone when you eventually do - no one speaks English! I decided to move over to email as this surely could eliminate he language barrier. After 8 emails I finally get a rely. I wanted to book a spa afternoon and afternoon tea for my mother and I. A serious complaint and 8 emails finally i am told we are booked into the spa and for massages at 2pm and then afternoon tea at 4pm. When we arrive there was no sch thing as a spa!! there is NO spa facilities. The massages and afternoon tea was not booked in and they had no idea who were were. we walked around with no hep or guidance for a long time before anyone asked to help us and then when t they finally did there was a lot of tutting and irritation. Even upon showing the email from them to confirm and to ask about the supposed 'spa' there was annoyance on their behalf and tutting. We had a what could only be described as RUSHED and ;painful massage - it was so terrible we were both in the most intense pain the next day - unable to walk properly. The onl reason I have given any rating is because poor Marcos who was helping at he restaurant was so embarrassed and really don his best to help us and that points are for him personally and nothing else. Yes the place is impressive externally and yes internally it has wow factor however you will feel stressed, irritated, ignored and annoyed and like you have been shafted for your money. AVOID",1,2015,10,26
119,"Fabulous weekend ,totally wonderful hotel","My husband & I have just returned from a 2 night stay to see U2 at The O2 and celebrate our wedding anniversary on board The Sunborn, what a fantastic hotel staff so friendly and helpful, accommodation excellent we had an executive cabin the whole experience was second to none. The staff were aware of our anniversary and treated us to a complimentary glass of wine on arrival. The Docklands area is great , the Emirates Cable car an experience with fabulous views, all in all a great weekend, we will certainly return to The Sunborn.",5,2015,10,26
119,A special experience,"Wow, when I search for hotels I've got into the habit of ticking the unrated box to get the opportunity to look at those quirky places.  When I saw this luxery yatch I was completely drawn in.  My family of 5 stayed for just one night and we had a very special experience.

The staff and food were excellent.  Okay so it's a bit out of the way, but the views of Canary Wharf at night were superb. We've not been on a luxery yatch before and it was everything that you'd expect. Smartly dressed staff, polished brass, chandeliers and Moulton Brown in the bathrooms.  

We weren't going to the Excel but it is next door to it if you were. You may not choose this location as a base to explore the city, but it is perfect for a very special evening.",5,2015,10,22
119,Romantic Anniversary,"What a great surprise, when my partner arrived with me at the yacht on the occasion of our 5th anniversary. 
The yacht looks very impressive from outside. You arrive on the 3rd floor for check in, the lobby is very glamorous, especially the chandelier. The ladies at the reception were extremely friendly and likewise friendly young gentlemen helped us with the luggage and escorted us to the room. The welcome in the room was amazing. My partner surprised me with rose petals, Champagne and chocolate in our spacious room with a separate seating area. There was also a personal welcome not from the General Manager. We enjoyed our Champagne on the balcony overlooking the O2 arena and Canary Wharf. The restaurant was very busy and we had a very nice table in the middle of the restaurant enjoying the fantastic view. Service was very attentive and I liked especially the genuine friendliness of the waiter who was looking after us. After the dinner we had a delicious cocktail in the bar. We had a light room service breakfast because my partner booked a massage at the Spa which was just wonderful. We had one of the best anniversaries ever and I made already a booking for my partner's birthday early next year. Cant wait to be back. A big thank you to the entire team. ",5,2015,10,21
119,Hidden gem in London,"Well as much as I enjoy sea cruising, I have never come across this amazing little yacht/ship/hotel which is permanently berthed outside the Excel exhibition centre in London's docklands.
My biggest fear about staying there was accessibility into central London, but I need not have feared, the DLR and Jubilee underground line got me there within 20-30 minutes, and the station is only a couple of minutes from the hotel.
The area is a very nice redeveloped area with lots of restaurants, bars, etc.
Check-in was fantastic. I unusually arrived at exactly 1500 and my room was ready - albeit I think I got an upgrade, but the pleasant lady on reception didn't mention it. A very nice gesture. The room was very spacious with a balcony and a compact but pleasant shower room. Toiletries were Molton Brown - a sign of a good quality establishment!
There is a very nice bar with outdoor area - all service is waiter service, but drinks were very promptly delivered. Prices are expensive for drinks, but that's London, and that's hotels!
On the Sunday morning they seem to have a novel pricing structure for breakfast - GBP7.50 prior to 0900 and GBP12.50 between 0900 and 1100. Perfectly acceptable for a good quality breakfast, but I believe on weekdays the price is GBP19.00 - not as acceptable.

I have booked to stay there again next week for a couple of nights. It is nowhere near the function I am attending, but the service and ambience was so good that I really can't resist going back.  
Room rates were in line with other hotels I was looking at in London - i.e. Novotel, Hilton etc.
Try it! It's great!",5,2015,10,21
119,Great stay.,If you're looking for somewhere a little different to stay Sunborn London is an excellent choice. The check in staff were lovely and the room a good size.and well equipped. The Hotel has a good bar which overlooks the O2 arena and Canary Wharf. The surrounding area is pretty quiet with a few decent looking restaurants. If you're visiting the O2 it's a 5 minute walk to the Emorates cable cars which are great as long as you've got a head for heights ans will take you right there. There's 24 hour room service and the room service pizza's are fab! Late check out time too which is welcome.,5,2015,10,20
119,A hard few days made easy,"Exhibitions are long days and hard work, so when exhibiting at Excel a colleague came up with the idea of staying at Sunborn. What a great idea it turned out to be. Ideally located adjacent to the main entrance doors and an oasis of tranquility and good service after a hectic day. Rooms and public areas well presented, comfortable and in top condition. Never a queue at reception. Friendly helpful staff who even had a sense of humour.",5,2015,10,20
119,Luxurious and Unique,"We had a great friendly welcome from Nazma on reception and nothing was too much trouble for her. We were even treated to a glass of champagne to celebrate our anniversary.

Nazma and Sandra helped us with booking the Thames Clipper and sorted out train times for DLR, the station is a short walk from the yacht and gets you into the center of London.

We ate in the restaurant and had a table overlooking the stern with views over the water to the O2 dome and the Emirates Sky Line both look great light up at night. 

All the staff we dealt with were really great and were a credit to the company.

We would definitely recommend this unique hotel and we look forward to our return",5,2015,10,19
119,LOVELY FOR A DIFFERENT EXPERIENCE,"My husband and I stayed on the Sunborn 9 years ago, but that was a different ship.  This one is bigger and newer, however, they were very similar and rooms felt identical.  Rooms are very spacious, and so are the bathrooms if you've ever stayed on a cruise liner!  Everywhere is very clean, bed and sofa very comfortable and towels and linen high quality.  There was an offer of breakfast for £7.50 - 7am till 9 am on the Sunday.  We took this offer up and it was a very good, extensive buffet breakfast, with lovely views up ahead the Thames of the o2 Arena and Emirates Airline.  We were glad of the chance to have had such a lovely breakfast in the lovely surroundings of the Restaurant at a reasonable price, though would have been mad if I'd paid a much higher price in advance when booking, which I would think many people did...?
Staff were very friendly and professional.  We did have a scare on checking in, when they had 4 rooms booked for us - I had visions of me having to pay a massive bill, but this did eventually get sorted, they said they hadn't received cancellations from internet booking sites and there was also an unexplicable additional booking...I don't know whose fault this was, but it did get sorted thankfully and the receptionist was very helpful, but felt rather stressed for half an hour, till it did!
I would certainly recommend this hotel.  A lovely location for a different stay in London, about 40 mins from the centre on the tube/DLR.",5,2015,10,19
119,Fantastic stay,"Staff on arrival were very friendly and helpful. Room was very big and the bed was really comfortable. We enjoyed the fact that it was away from the noise of the city but within half an hour you was right in the centre of London. Breakfast was exceptional with as much as you can eat and over looking the river with the O2 and cable cars in the background, it was one of the best views you could have. Thoroughly enjoyed it.",5,2015,10,19
119,Fantastic,"I would recommend this hotel and would love to stay again. Just wish my visit had been for more than 1 night.
The rooms are spacious and luxurious. The staff were friendly and helpful.
I didn't have breakfast as I felt £20 was a bit excessive and there are places in the Excel much cheaper, which is just a 2 minute walk away.
A few points, the lift was out of order during my stay which was a little inconvenient and the noise from the airplanes became a nuisance as you are on the flight path for London City Airport. 
",5,2015,10,18
119,luxury at the best,"Arrived here to be very warmly welcomed by great staff, we were quickly booked in and shown our room. The room was very spacious and airy and spotlessly clean. The room  was well stocked with various teas and coffees for you and free bottles of water.
The dock in ehich the yacht is moored is quiet with some nice bars and restuarants.

Well worth a visit if staying in London",5,2015,10,18
119,Sunborn good if your an exhibitor,"Sunborn at Victoria Dock is a floating Hotel that, close to ExCel one of London’s major exhibition halls,its convenient if you are an exhibitor. The rooms are serviceable, beds are comfortable, situated on the Thames and along London City airport flight path and 10 minutes to Emirates Air Line the cable car ride over the Thames which gives you a birds eye view of the Greenwich peninsula and the Royal Docks.",3,2015,10,18
119,Great end to our honeymoon,"Fantastic different place to stay in London.As we had flown into City airport on our return trip from Italy, we wanted an over night stay nearby.....and we found the perfect place. 
Pristine condition, immaculate in every way, beautifully decorated and the best front of house staff we have encountered; Sandra is a credit the hotel.
When we got to our classic room, the lowest tariff room..we were amazed at its size and luxurious feeling.
We decided to eat in the on board restaurant and it was a jewel; professional, discreet, friendly and efficient waiting staff. I will review the restaurant separately as it deserves its own space.
Checkout for us was very early, but again front of house were great..even though they were in middle of a change over Sandra made time to take photos of us for our memories.
We will definitely be returning.",5,2015,10,17
119,Great!,Loved it! Rooms were peaceful and beds were very comfy. Reception staff were helpful. Location for the O2 was perfect. We just got the cable cars over the river. But drinks in the bar were very expensive and the bar staff extremely slow.,4,2015,10,16
119,Real novelty and great location!,"For basically the same price as most other comparable hotel room nearby you get the novelty factor of staying on a luxury yacht.
Ok, its not cheap at the bar or for food but that's a comment you could throw at most London hotels! The novelty factor of feeling like your on a cruise, if only for a night really adds to a short London break and the location for the o2 arena and surrounding area is as good as anywhere you could stay.
Would highly recommend and would stay again!",5,2015,10,16
119,WOW!,"From walking towards this boat to entering our reaction was WOW!
Beautiful decor, very very clean, attentive and friendly staff.
Our room was amazing, so comfortable, sumptuous and room temperature was very comfy.
Advise to stay there and we'll go back for definite.",5,2015,10,16
119,Fabulous stay,"Stayed for one night whilst visiting the Excel, convenient location, I had a lovely comfy room overlooking the river, staff were very friendly and helpful especially at breakfast. Can't wait to stay again.",5,2015,10,15
119,Nice and a bit different,"Let me set the record straight. This is far from being 'the best hotel I've stayed in'. Whoever said it is, hasn't travelled much. 

However, it is ""nice"". It's something different from the usual business traveller type hotels I find myself in.

The staff are incredibly polite and very helpful - not common amongst London based hotels. Food was okay - albeit it needs to expand on its breakfast buffet range - as it currently doesn't represent good value for £20.

The Bar area is neat and it's nice to be able to look out on the river without paying too much of a premium for the privilege.   

The location could be a minor hindrance if you're using this as a base to get into Central London. However, its ideal for Greenwich and the O2 area

I paid slightly more than a London Premier Inn rate. In that regard, this represents a bargain! Would I go again - yes.",3,2015,10,15
119,Luxury in a great location,"My wife and I had a one night stay on the Sunborn Yacht while in London for a gig at the O2. The hotel is in a great location and we opted for the slightly more expensive waterside view which was wonderful as the sun went down in the evening!
The room was immaculate and luxuriously appointed with a very large comfy bed, a coffee machine, complimentary water and free wifi.
The Yacht is right outside the West entrance of ExCel and hence the best DLR stop is Custom House. The Emirates Air Line is within easy walking distance and makes a great way to get to the O2 (note that the Air Line is open until 9pm not 7pm as stated on their web site). There are a few restaurants within walking distance hence we did not dine on the yacht. My only gripe is the price for breakfast: top tip - there is a great cafe about half way between the yacht and the Air Line entrance. We had a lovely breakfast each for much less than half the price on the Yacht.
Overall we would highly recommend the Sunborn London and would definitely choose to stay again.",4,2015,10,15
119,Mr Joseph-Severin,Great hotel one of the best I've stayed in if not the best. Staff are very friendly and helpful. Also has enough places around to go for dinner if you don't fancy what's on board. 10/10 would recommend it to anyone.,5,2015,10,14
119,A fantastic experience!,"This yacht hotel is a fantastic and unique hotel to base yourself. It's location makes it ideal to access DLR, Excel, O2, Emirates cable car, Westfield shopping, London City Airport, Greenwich Clipper and, subsequently, all the sites and places in London you are wanting to visit. The hotel's staff are friendly, professional and cater for all your needs. The hotel decor is outstanding and superior to any 5 star hotel I have stayed. The facilities are excellent, with stunning views of the O2  and Emirates experience in action. The rooms are clean and have a superkingsize bed and lounge area with tea/coffee making, mini bar, tv, telephone, room service and stylish ensuite shower. 
I have no hesitation in recommending this hotel to all travellers and will certainly be returning when in London again.",5,2015,10,14
119,Amazing hotel,I have stayed at this hotel on a few occasions and every time I've started there the sevices gets better. Rooms are a great size and amazing views ideal locations and quick and easy booking/check out. I would recommend this hotel to anyone that needs to stay in this area,5,2015,10,13
119,Luxury stay,"We stayed here for our 35th wedding anniversary and took the opportunity to visit a few attractions in london.  The room was superb. With views across the Thames to the O2 and further up river to the famous buildings in the distance.  We were treated extremely well, and all the staff made us feel very special. Could not fault it, and highly recommend for something that extra special!  We will definitely return.  We have even looked into booking the one in Gibralter !",5,2015,10,13
119,Something special,"Fantastically different hotel on Victoria Dock. 15 minutes from the O2 including an interesting cable car ride. Couple of stops and a change on the DLR to get home as the cable car stops before evening shows at the O2 finish. Luxurious, spacious rooms with a great shower and comfy bed. Reasonably priced bottle of wine bought from the bar and breakfast good value at £12.50. Per night price similar to the Ibis next door if booked in advance. If you are visiting this part of London, this hotel is heartily recommended.",5,2015,10,13
119,Sun Born Hotel London.,"Stayed at the Sun Born Hotel on the 10th October. A very vibrant area to have a Hotel. Never mind a Yacht. As soon as you set eyes on the yacht, you get the wow factor. And when you get on board, you are met with a magnificent steel and glass stair way up to the restaurant, in the centre is a beautiful chandelier. The staff are very friendly and efficient. The room was very clean and comfy. A super king size bed, very comfy, a balcony with dock side view. Didn't eat on board so can not comment on the food. There are a few very nice restaurants  right next to the yacht. Rail link a matter of minutes walk away.  In all a very good Hotel.",4,2015,10,13
119,Outstanding,"What can I say?!  Struggling to fill the 200 word count required.  A beautiful hotel yacht, good staff, good food, a totalling relaxing time.  Thoroughly recommend this hotel.  This was an anniversary trip and we both had a fantastic stay and will definitely return!",5,2015,10,12
119,Wonderful place to stay,"We stayed here on the 2nd & 3rd of October.  The boat has a huge WOW factor, it looks amazing & it is!  Really luxurious.  Went up in the lift to reception & was greeted by a lovely lady who booked us in quickly and smoothly, very polite & no issues at all.  You then have to use your room key in the lift to go up to the rooms.  The room was huge & decorated lovely.  We requested a river view which we got and it was lovely looking out of the large window.  The bed was very comfy – think I might have to buy some of the pillows they use – really lovely and comfy.  The shower was good.  I always take a hairdryer but to keep luggage down I decided to take a chance and use the hairdryer provided, I wish I hadn’t, it was a very small, low powered hairdryer in the bathroom which for me was next to useless plus my husband had to wait for me to finish drying my hair before he could go in the shower, there was no ventilation in the bathroom and the mirror was all steamed up (use the hairdryer to clear it) you had to keep your finger on the button the whole time to keep it on.  Sunburn, give us girls a decent hairdryer in the room!  I expect this when you go abroad as this is standard but not in the UK.  This was my only gripe and can easily be solved by taking your own hairdryer

We had a drink at the deck bar and we were lucky to have good weather so sat outside which was amazing.  Yes, the drinks are expensive and the 12.5% service charge annoying however you’re in London and in a posh “hotel” so is to be expected.  I had the Sunborn Cocktail which was lovely and it was quite a big one so justified the price in my mind!  From the deck you see people walking past the yacht and stopping to take photos of it so we felt like superstars lol.

Perfect location for the o2 & near the cable cars and tube.

We didn’t have the breakfast and didn’t use any of the other facilities.

Wouldn’t hesitate to recommend this hotel to anyone.",5,2015,10,12
119,Excellent,"Really unusual location, but great views and excellent quality of accommodation.  Would recommend paying the extra for a riverside room with a balcony.  Staff were very helpful and friendly - nothing too much trouble.  Great breakfast and excellent cocktails on the deck in the evening, with fabulous views over to the O2 and Emirates Air.",5,2015,10,11
119,Anniversary weekend,"My husband booked this trip for our 20th wedding anniversary. What an amazing experience, we were upgraded on arrival and made to feel very special.  The staff were fantastic, very attentive but very discreet. The room was beautiful. The food spectacular. Amazing can't wait to go back, thank you.",5,2015,10,11
119,"Nice hotel, but....","Stayed here for one night for our anniversary as it was something different.
Hotel room lovely and inside of hotel gorgeous.
However this hotel is obviously used for group get together soon from the Excel so if you want a quiet drink and seat forget it as it all taken up by the exhibitionists.
It seemed more effort was put into the groups rather than visiting guests, as I have mentioned no seats available. Maybe they should have sectioned off part of the bar for this. Obviously a lots of people in the groups were staying at this hotel as well.
Because of this we went out and come back later, ordered a drinky via the waiter which he forgot so went to the bar to get ourselves.
The 12.5% service charge is a bit high considering we never got any and having to pay £40 up front for any expenses was a bit different as everywhere else just takes card details, plus there was nothing in the mini bar anyway.
Nice hotel but due to our experience we will not be returning.",4,2015,10,11
119,Unique hotel,"Having stayed in the summer on the Sunborn in Gibraltar, when I knew I had to stay over for a conference at the ExCeL, I thought i'd book into the Sunborn at Docklands.  It's not as salubrious as Gibraltar, probably because it's a lot smaller, but it's a lovely place to stay nonetheless and the breakfast was certainly as good.  Great views over Canary wharf from the restaurant and bard and the staff were all very friendly.  The sleep quality was fantastic and nice big fluffy towels.  Only dislike was the bathroom, very small and the door always swings shut, so when you're trying to dry your hair (I hate hairdryers in the bathroom!) you can't see as it's steamed up. however, using the desk chair to prop it open sufficed!  A colleague stayed at the nearby Travel Lodge and paid a tenner less than I did, and my breakfast was included, his wasn't and he had a really bad night sleeps due to the uncomfortable bed.  So pleased I stayed here!",4,2015,10,10
119,Great Hotel when visiting Excel,"The Sunborn Hotel is a large floating yacht moored directly opposite Excel Exhibition & Conference Centre. It looks great from the outside and is fabulous inside too. Rooms are very comfortable and well appointed. I had a outside cabin complete with balcony overlooking the Thames, all very nice. Breakfast buffet was excellent as was the overall service. At £170 per night it wasn't cheap but it was inline with the other land based hotels nearby. If you get a chance try the Sunborn, it is so much nicer than the Holiday Inn.",4,2015,10,08
119,3 day break in luxury with attentive staff always on hand...excellent relaxing hotel,"Booked a family executive suite with river view for 3 days. The setting of this hotel is outstanding, not too close to other premises and on the river means it's peaceful with the exception of the planes arriving at City airport, but this is something we knew, and have to say it didn't bother us at any time. From arrival staff were helpful, polite and attentive, and as you will see from other reviews guests are well looked after at all times. The hotel is unique, and shows opulence from the moment you arrive. Our room was perfect, clean, with lovely facilities, and the bed was so comfy, probably the best hotel bed I have ever had. The first night we ate onboard, bit pricey as were the drinks, but we were expecting higher prices. The breakfast was lovely, not bad for £12.50 each at the weekend, fresh and hot, with plenty of fruit, cereals, etc, and plenty of coffee to wake up after a solid nights sleep. Would recommend this hotel to anyone, particularly couples who want a special stay with attentive staff and quality service. Well done Sunborn staff and management, you have it just right for customer service and quality.",5,2015,10,07
119,"Lovely staff, great views - luxury! ","Short break for my birthday. It's 5  star yacht with a luxurious feel to the ship. Room was spacious although bed a little lumpy. Bar and view of London skyline was a treat, and the restaurant on board excellent. Short walk to Emirates cable car a short walk.   ",4,2015,10,06
119,London weekend,"Excellent & quirky to stay on a yacht. friendly & helpful staff, spotlessly clean everywhere, would thoroughly recommend.breakfast bit pricey,but eat as much as you like for £12.50. Only real downside was drink prices.£5. For a beer,£11.for a G & T, £8. For 1 glass of prossecco. I can buy a bottle for much less than that in Sainsburys! Also service charge on all drinks. Expected higher prices for London but thought it was over the top.

service charge on all drinks.over the top!",4,2015,10,04
119,Amazing stay,"We stayed last night and i have read most of the reviews on here and yes i had my doubts. But i'm pleased to say how wrong was i . The hotel is so amazing even having seen the pictures they don't do it justice. We had a river view room with extras as it was my partners birthday. I won't say it was pristine there were the odd stain here and there but you can tell it's been cleaned. We had a huge bed extremely comfy large tv a powerful shower a coffee machine and a tablet. We didn't have an evening meal as we had plans to visit some tourist spots. We did have breakfast and by my standards it was an 8 out of 10 and i have stayed in many hotels i couldn't ask for a better selection from a cooked breakfast to cold meats, bagels, pastries, cereals, juice, coffee and tea so much choice. It wasn't piping hot as it sits in warmers but it was very tasty and we loved it. We did get back in time for drinks which are very good too and a view that is stunning. The service is not as bad as made out in reviews it's not instant but these guys are not sitting idle there's room service a resturant and a bar and for us they are doing a great job. Overall i found the customer service top notch having worked in retail for over 20 years i know what i expect and sunborn you were some of the best. Special mention to Timea, Maryiam and Roberto you were excellent and made us feel very welcome and nothing was to much trouble thank you so much you do a wonderful job. Finally Apostolos Fanaris thank you for all your help and the lovely postcard message it was appreciated we had the most amazing time thanks to you and your staff . For anyone reading this ignore the negative comments and get on board a truly unique experience",5,2015,10,04
119,Great place,"I just left this great hotel, first time I stay on a yacht hotel. When I saw the reviews and booked it, thought there might be some exaggeration from reviewers in saying how awesome is this place, however it's 100% awesome. I enjoyed the fancy very clean room, staff were helpful & smiling, service was great. Definitely will recommend this hotel to others. ",5,2015,10,04
119,Vastly exceeded our expectations,"We enjoyed a delicious afternoon tea on a luxurious yacht. All the staff were friendly and helpful; they made you feel really special. On arrival from the Docklands Light Railway, a short walk to the Sunborn Yacht Hotel we went up to reception in the lift and we enjoyed our first hour on board sitting out on a sunny deck in the bar area, watching the Emirates Airline cable cars crossing the river.",5,2015,10,02
119,Short Break,"An amazing stay, unusual and fun. Quiet yet close to the city for all the sight seeing. Staff really friendly and very helpful. View of the river fantastic.  The room was extremely spacious,  clean and everything  you could wish for. Facilities very good, just wish we could have stayed for longer than two nights but will definitely  return.",5,2015,10,02
119,Amazing place to stay,"I stayed here for two nights as I was exhibiting at the Food Entrepreneur and Takeaway Expo at ExCel.
To be honest The Sunborn is not normally the type of hotel I would choose for a business trip as it is in the higher price bracket. I booked about 6 weeks in advance and after looking on Travel Supermarket I managed to get a very good deal including breakfast which was cheaper than the nearby Ibis or Novotel!
I was very impressed with the standard of the room, it was the Classic Room with a dockside view and although not as picturesque as a river view it was not disappointing. The room is very spacious with a huge comfortable bed (with plenty of pillows) and sofa and lived up to the photos on the Sunborn's website.
The bathroom was of a decent size with a shower you could move around in easily. Nice complimentary Molton Brown toiletries too.
Even though the hotel is close to City Airport and the planes fly directly overhead, it was nice and quiet in the room.
My Classic Room had a sealed window (to be expected on deck 2 as it is a sea-going vessel!). There is air-con which can be controlled so you can set it to your individual heat/cooling requirements.
Good security too as your keycard also needs to be used in the lift to access your deck as well as the door to each deck and finally your room. Had a little problem on our second night when I found the key card had stopped working but the staff on reception quickly sorted it out.
Good choice for breakfast (buffet style) with a great view over the water to the city. There was a variety of hot and cold options from a full English to continental style with ham, cheese, breads, pastries etc. plus cereals, muesli, yogurt and fruit.
I really loved this place and would definitely stay again.",4,2015,10,01
119,Beautiful unique hotel,"Stayed here one night for my partners birthday in an executive room. What a fantastic hotel

The room was spotless and very opulent. We had a dock land view but don't be worried about that it's still worth it.

The hotel itself is gorgeous and so different.

The only downside was was the service was pretty slow in the bar and be warned, we asked for some more water in the room and two small bottles cost us just shy of £7 which we thought was wxtutionat! Should have just run the tap!

All in all thought we would definitely return and recommend to everyone.",5,2015,10,01
119,Interesting place to stay !,"This is a lovely change to the standard hotel !
The staff go out of their way to look after you from the moment you step aboard !
The cabin is very pleasant and very comfortable.
The bed was extremely comfortable and very quiet despite the location of City Airport.
The shower was very good and we had a great stay !
There were lovely reasonably priced cocktails upstairs and it is worth a visit to the bar,
We did not have breakfast as we felt the price was a little steep !
It is easy to reach the location and there are local places to eat or drink.
Well placed to enjoy the Olympic Stadium and the Westfield Shopping centre at Stratford !",4,2015,09,30
119,LUXURIOUS YACHT HOTEL,"We went there to celebrate our 39th wedding anniversary in August 2015, and stayed for 2 nights (Wed & Thurs).  The Reception upgraded us to a Riverview Executive suite with a balcony. Result! This was lovely with lacquered furniture and a very comfortable bed. In fact all the room services were excellent and of a high calibre. Situated right by the Excel and very convenient for the Railway.  We didn't eat at the hotel as the Dinner Menu didn't really appeal to us so we ate out about 200 yards away the first night. For breakfast (which was £19.95 each and expensive) both mornings we ate out in a local place again about 200 yards away where a full English breakfast was about £5.95 and we had a table that overlooked the river for that.  We had coffee and wine in the bar both evenings which was quiet and relaxing and had doors which opened onto an outside deck with table and chairs. Lovely. It is under a flight path to London City Airport and the planes come in quite low, but for a couple of days stay it is no problem. No flights after about 8'ish in the evening so nothing to keep you awake at night, In fact it is quite fun distinguishing what airline the planes were from! Would definitely recommend and stay again.",5,2015,09,30
119,Drinks on the deck,"My daughter and I spent a glorious afternoon on the deck, sun was shining and we met some lovely people who were staying on the ship.  Expensive, but your are paying for the surroundings and the fantastic setting.  Definitely recommend for a special day or night out.",4,2015,09,30
119,Felt like royalty,"This was a wonderful place to come for a relaxing massage and facial.  We had ordered a champagne afternoon tea through Groupon with the massage.  The facial was extra.  Between the treatments and the booking for the afternoon tea we had an hour to kill and we visited the bar.  It was such a lovely setting and we were able to order champagne and sit on the deck in the sunshine.  At the specified time we made our way to the restaurant on the first floor, again gorgeous surroundings.  Unfortunately the afternoon tea is not the best we have had and the service in the restaurant was somewhat lacking.  This spoilt what up until then had been an amazing experience.  It is not cheap and it is very luxurious so that kind of makes up for the service in a way but because of the surroundings and the expense of the place we would have expected exemplary service.",4,2015,09,29
119,Great Hospitality,"I would like to thank you for your great hospitality.

We stayed with you for a sightseeing weekend. We had such a wonderful time with family. Perfect location for Excel and really close to DLR station. 

The rooms are large, really comfortable and well fitted out with most of the amenities you will need. We enjoyed the ambiance from the bar and view from deck, it’s amazing.  The staff was lovely and helpful, especially Kirtan from reception, even though our AC wasn't working in our room which we realised at night when we back from O2. He reassured us by setting up portable fan and willing to help even though hotel was fully booked. He has recommended breakfast in Lands End Restaurant and was delightful. Outstanding experience, good concept too. 

We will coming back to celebrate our 15th wedding anniversary in January 2016.",5,2015,09,29
119,Fantastic place for a drink,We had an idyllic afternoon watching the sun set and soaking up the atmosphere - great to go over on the cable car from the O2.  We did not have time to stay the evening but we did get a grand tour and the rooms look amazing.  Thanks to all the staff there for making are afternoon so pleasurable.,5,2015,09,29
119,Excellence from start to finish,"Opted for the Sunborn based on tripadvisor reviews. From our late Sat arrival to early Monday departure the staff were exceptional and met our every need - late room service meal, printed flight boarding passes, location of ATMs, taxis ordered, wake up calls, taking photos of us on board! etc. every single one knew their job inside out - to look after their customers brilliantly.  As for the yacht, there was a touch of elegance about the public areas. The bedrooms were private, secure, large and comfortable, with the balcony overlooking the river great. Touches such as top of the range coffee machines and electronic information pads were super. All in all a fantastic few nights and for london prices was good as well. Also to note we flew home from london City which is 5 mins away. Also not bad from Stanstead. Stanstead express to Stratford then DLR to Custom Excell.",5,2015,09,28
119,Much more than a normal hotel,"We stayed on the Sunborn on a Friday night after visiting an exhibition in the Excel centre. It was a lovely experience. All staff were lovely and extremely helpful - nothing was too much trouble. The rooms were beautiful, clean and very large with a huge comfy super sized bed. Our room overlooked the water and gave a fantastic view of the O2, the cable car and the lovely new flats in the area. The rooms very very quiet and we weren't really aware of anyone else around.
We had the set menu in the evening which was £32 for two courses including a glass of champagne. The food was very good though service was a little slow - when we mentioned this we were give a large complementary glass of wine which was a lovely touch. Breakfast was £12.50 (weekend rate) and was amazing - everything you could think of - all fresh and beautifully presented. Only very small negative comment was the restaurant was quite chilly.
We would definitely stay again and I would highly recommend.",5,2015,09,28
119,Birthday to remember,"We celebrated my wifes 50th birthday on the Sunborn, and i can honestly say the complete experience was wonderful.
I booked a two night stay in an Ocean view cabin with balcony and also reserved the Wheelhouse private dining room for a suprise party for my wife. On arrival at check in the  reception manager was the perfect host with complimentary drinks for myself and my wife. He assisted brilliantly in enabling me to ""smuggle"" the party guests onboard undetected from my wife. The private dining room was excellent, located at the front of the ship on the top deck. The food was great and the waiting staff were very efficient.
My wife had a memorable birthday and i thank everyone onboard for making it a great weekend to remember.",5,2015,09,26
119,Its as good as it looks,Used sunborn as a base for watching rugby at Olympic park. Great location for using dlr and tube from custom house and canary wharf. Staff were friendly and attentive. A unique hotel and a great place to stay,5,2015,09,26
119,Excellent  place  to stay ,"Great  place to stay,relax great location, 
Gives you that holiday  feeling! 
Extra  thanks to Isabella  and Nazma, for a friendly helpful welcome.
Great cocktails
great nibbles..
The extras  like the Molton Brown  toiletries & the lovley  light  weight dressing gowns,luxury  rooms.
thanks for  great stay,looking  forward  too come back soon, tonight perhaps  :)",5,2015,09,26
119,FANTASTIC YACHT GREAT TIME,"Did not know what to expect, but Fantastic. Yacht is breath taking, staff are very attentive. Snacks in the bar great, drinks to be expected are not cheap, bottle of beer £5 cocktails from £11. We still had a fantastic time. 
Room was unbelievable with a river view room number 2034. In the room they even give you a tablet to use just in case you forgot yours, Molton Brown in the bathroom. All I can say is FANTASTIC, and we will be back. ",5,2015,09,25
119,Amazing Hotel,"I had booked an hotel room just for one night to surprise my finance, the room was amazing, the staff were very helpful and smiling at all times. I want to be back and have requested to speak to the manager about returning at least once a month but nobody has replied yet, if they can organise me staying there on a regular basis I will be extremely happy as the yacht is beautiful. Lastly the beds were amazing best night sleep I've had in a long time.",5,2015,09,24
119,An amazing hotel,This floating hotel is truly a luxury yacht. It has great rooms which are very spacious. It made such a refreshing change to staying in to the usual hotel rooms. The beds were beyond amazing and we enjoyed the best nights sleep ever. The only down side is that I have now got to go out and buy these pillows before I can sleep again. Couldn't recommend the place more. Great value and the staff were all friendly and helpful.,5,2015,09,24
119,Horrendous customer service...,"My partner booked me a night here at this hotel for our two year anniversary. I was extremely excited after seeing photos of this place because it really was a once in a life time hotel stay. My partner deliberately booked the river view so that we got the full experience of staying on a yacht. Just a few days before our stay my partner emailed the hotel to ask about check in times. To my devastation, the hotel emailed us back to state our room had changed to a dock view due to an error of double booking. I was absolutely shocked to hear this news because what is the point of staying on a yacht to look into the docks when we had only booked the hotel for a yacht experience and therefore look out over water. After explaining this to the hotel all they could offer was £20 off our stay or cancellation. The original price was £300 for the night. Did they really think we would be willing to go ahead and still pay a huge £280 to look over nothing other than a dock and therefore have no private balcony as such? Also, if we had not emailed the hotel in the first place when would we have found out about this room error? On arrival, after spending £100 each on a train ticket to London?
The hotel really did not seem to care at all about ruining our plans. They continued to offer nothing more than the £20 off or cancellation. We even wrote to explain our frustration and have since heard nothing back. For such a high spec hotel I really thought they have much better customer service and care about people willing to spend £300 a night on their business.  I would also expect them to have a compaints team at very least to respond to our letter. It is an absolute disgrace and we certainly will not be recommending this hotel to anyone. It is such a shame.",1,2015,09,21
119,Unfortuantely Disappointing,"Having booked this as a treat for myself and my husband for our 23rd wedding anniversary after a year of trying to fight the big C, we were left very underwhelmed by our whole experience.
On arrival we tried to check in being told we had a child staying with us in our room!
They then tried to charge us an extra £70 on top of the agreed room rate.
The receptionist insisted that she could not amend the price without myself forwarding her the email sent to me by the company she worked for!!!
We eventually got everything sorted out and went to our room which was lovely and we had a letter from the manager, some chocolates and a bed strewn with red rose petals and swans made of towels - lovely you may think?.
Our friends had actually arranged all of this including a bottle of champagne that was no where to be seen!
It was only when we met our friends that evening in London that we found this out and then they were also disappointed as their surprise had not been fulfilled.
The electronic info tablet in the room failed to work.
Sunday morning found reception unmanned and no clear indication of where to go and have breakfast. It was only the clinking of china that led the way!.
Checkout was fantastic and the receptionist couldn't have been more helpful, maybe because we were leaving.
On the whole not worth the money or the trek out from the city centre.",3,2015,09,21
119,Friendly and different,"Great room sizes, friendly staff, and just a refreshing change of hotel (being on a yacht!!).
Beds and bedding very comfortable. Good Molton brown toiletries. 
To get to central London takes about 40 mins (dlr to Canning Town, jubilee to town...).",4,2015,09,20
119,Made for a great birthday present,"I booked a one night stay on the Sunborn London for my boyfriend's birthday and we had an amazing time. The rooms were beautiful, as was the setting. It's in quite a quiet area of London but would recommend a trip on the Emirates cable car over to the O2. Dinner was good - the food was delicious and the set menu was good value.  Service was on the slow side at the bar and restaurant and it took a little while to order our drinks. But apart from that it was faultless. ",4,2015,09,20
119,Fantastic Hotel,We booked the Sunborn for a night away for our Honeymoon when we arrived we were upgraded to a Junior Suite which was fantastic.All the staff and Hotel Manager were very professional and friendly. The room was large and the most comfiest bed we have ever slept in! Breakfast was lovely fantastic and lots of variety. We will be definitely going back  this time with our children.,5,2015,09,19
119,Shocking service,"Was left standing outside security gates unable to check in for hours after a 4.5 hour drive then manager blaming hotels.com for not being able to contact us to let us know, this has spoiled what was supposed to be a birthday treat for my partner severely disappointed, thankfully got refunded and booked into the Novotel next door at a cost of £60 more to me!!!!!",1,2015,09,18
119,Amazing Hotel,We stayed at The Sunborn for my birthday and was very impressed. We had lunch in the restaurant whilst we were waiting for our room and this turned out to be great food at a reasonable price. Breakfast far too expensive. Well worth staying at this hotel though.,5,2015,09,17
119,Out of the ordinary,"Good quality throughout. The room, with river view, was very well appointed. With no traffic in the dock it was quiet and completely stable. The public areas were attractive and comfortable. Service was prompt, courteous and efficient. Lunch was available from the bar, freshly cooked and served in a relaxed surrounding. The restaurant was fully booked for the evening when we checked in at 2pm. Breakfast served until 10.30 was excellent. Location is good with DLR public transport links close by. Great for City airport, Excel arena and Docklands. The absence of parking was solved easily by using a parking website.",5,2015,09,16
119,Amazing,Accommodation and welcome excellent. The receptionists especially Mital was so helpful and professional. All staff first class guided by excellent management. Food and service at breakfast and evening meals first class and always served with happy helpful staff. We were a group of 13 with 5 kids and we all agreed the best accomodation we have ever had.  Thanks to all for such a great weekend stay with you.,5,2015,09,16
119,A hotel in London with a difference,"We booked this for our friends surprise birthday weekend.  From the time we booked in the staff were extremely friendly & helpful.  We arrived early and our room was ready so we were able to check in early and change for an afternoon in the city, checking in to the second room upon our return.  The rooms were spacious and very comfortable.  We were all really surprised at how quiet the rooms were.
Great location looking out onto the dock with a lovely night time view of Canary Wharf and the O2.  Very close to Docklands Light Railway which gave us easy access to the city centre.
We had evening dinner on the boat, the set menu was good value as was breakfast the next morning.",4,2015,09,15
119,Just okay,"We stayed here for our 25th wedding anniversary.  I suppose you could say this was unique because it is a ship rather than a building.  The room was large but too warm even with the air-conditioning.  We were disappointed that we could not eat at the restaurant as there was a private function going on.  We had to sit in the bar area, which would have been fine but the food took so long to come, and when it did come it was luke warm.  I would suggest that if you do not want to eat breakfast here, there are plenty of cafes around the area that serve full English for around £5.00.  We actually went to Starbucks and had some breakfast there.  The best thing about this was actually sitting on the deck having drinks, however we were lucky with the weather so perhaps that was why it was enjoyable.  It is close to the Emirates cable car with access to 02 and Excel, but apart from that there isn't much else to do.",3,2015,09,15
119,Cruise ship experience,"Spent a night here this month(September) and was pleasantly surprised. Had been told that as it was still very new it had had a few teething problems. My experience was first class. Rooms were large nothing pokey. The room looked out over the Thames and were able to see the river activity. The only grumble would be the flight path for the city airport it seems to be over The Sunborn, but you quickly get used to the planes and forget they are passing by. Wifi would not connect but not a real issue. Did not use the restaurant for an evening meal, but am told the food is good. We had the breakfast and cannot fault the quality/variety and quantity provided. The staff were all very attentive and pleasant, as was the front desk reception staff a credit to the management.
All in all well worth a stay, would use again.",5,2015,09,15
119,nice experiance.,"pure luxury! tablets in the rooms, Molton brown toiletries. fab location as you can get the cable car straight to the O2. nice boat to sit outside on the deck for a drink- although the drinks and food was very expensive which was to be expected. the breakfast was good- usual buffet. free wifi and great sized rooms. the only downside was that they pre-authorised your card £200 per room for extras which doesn't clear back into your account until 10 days after you leave so I had some bills etc that didn't get paid as I had booked 2 rooms, so £400 was reserved from my account! £200 is a bit much I'd say. the spa wasn't open when we stayed so cant comment.",4,2015,09,15
119,unique hotel,"Great Hotel with very friendly Staff and a super General Manager!
Very comfortable room and bed.
Next time I will stay again at The Sunborn Yacht Hotel.
A very nice place with a great holiday feeling.

Regards,
Jan",5,2015,09,14
119,Pleasant stay,"I booked this hotel for me and my partner to stay while we were in London. 

We checked in around 4pm. The staff were very polite and made it a very smooth process. 

Our room was over looking the dock. Very comfortable bed, good facilties and large room.

We decided not to eat in the evening as it was rather expensive. 

The only downside was that I paid £25 for breakfast on check in and it was advertised at £7.50 per person as a promotion....I visited reception and they declined a £10 refund. 

I wrote a letter but still not received a reply.",5,2015,09,13
119,A different way to stay in London,"Thoroughly enjoyed our night on board this luxury yacht, moored next to the Excel and with easy links via the DLR into town. We did have an upgrade to a room with balcony but the weather was too rotten to enjoy it. Very quiet and comfortable room with everything one required, including gowns and slippers, iron (!) and a good coffee machine! Also safe deposit box if needed and tablet beside he bed linked to the internet. Breakfast was expensive ( perhaps not by London standards) but very good with plenty of choice and good service. Parking not available at hotel but easily and cheaply arranged very nearby (100m)
Only downside fr me was the bed which was two doubles together to form one large super king - but the middle had a ridge that was uncomfortable; one good topper over the top would have solved the problem.
Clean, friendly, great service ( bar meals are excellent!) and convenient. Will definitely return when next in London.",5,2015,09,13
119,Fantastic hotel,Got to say that both me and my wife loved this hotel. Staff were very friendly and helpful. The room was clean & tidy. Parking and access was easy. The hotel was ideally situated to the tube and very close to the O2 dome.  Would definitely use it again and recommend it to friends and family  - 10/10,5,2015,09,13
119,Early flight from city,"I agree with all the comments about the comfort and size of the room. It would be called a suite on a cruise ship. Sundown drinks on the aft deck bar were a real pleasure. However the dinner was a let down. The £32 three course meal with champagne sounds good.  The chicken and leek starter was blended into cold rissoles, bland and tasteless, sadly there was a lot of it.
Sea bass with fennel,I failed to recognise when first served. The fillet was fried in batter and topped with chopped up hard boiled egg.
The fennel 2 ways, one Cole slaw, and also deep fried in batter. Dessert sticky toffee pudding was burnt and dry with dollop of clotted cream.
The whole meal was reminiscent of trip to Russia. Apparently the chef is Polish.  Such a shame for such an unusual venue",4,2015,09,12
119,A brief overnight stay and visit to the O2,"Stayed for one night to enable a visit to the O2 for the 'wear the rose' England rugby event, very well placed for this and obviously was a bit of a different experience staying on a yacht for a one night stay.

Good points. I have to say the customer service is excellent from all the staff, friendly and efficient. The boat is very plush (not super yacht opulent!) but very nice all the same, managed to get this stay on a special offer and it included breakfast. It is a brief stroll to the emirates cable car and there are plenty of bars and restaurants locally. the room was large and well presented, plenty of hot water and lovely comfortable beds. A nice outside patio area just off the bar and watching the planes come in overhead in to London City airport was amusing.

Bad points. The clown who decided to run a heavy metal container up a metal runway right outside our room on several occasions at 5.30am in the morning wasn't my favourite  person that day!  The breakfast was only barely warm which was a shame as it was plentiful and very nice otherwise, the coffee machine in the room didn't work and neither did the television (couldn't get a Sky signal!) the TV didn't particularly bother us but its all part of the deal I suppose.
Overall it was a pleasant enough stay for 1 night but I may have been a little disappointed if I had paid the full advertised rate and the £20 each person for breakfast.

Find a deal somewhere and give it a try if visiting the O2 or Excell centre.",3,2015,09,10
119,1st Wedding Anniversary Celebration,"Absolutely beautiful weekend from start to fiinish.  The Sunborn is a fabulous hotel and all of the staff were absolutely excellent.  We arrived there on the Friday evening and were efficiently and quickly checked in with a lovely young lady, Isabella, showing us to our room 'cabin'.  Nothing was too much trouble for her - we discussed that we were booked to eat in the Hotel the following and she was able to give advices of restaurants in the vicinity.  Our room was lovely and clean and very comfortable.  Breakfast on both mornings was very good indeed which a great choice selection.  Do book the Restaurant for dinner - we opted for the set menu to include a glass of champagne and all of it was just fab.  We have no hesitation in recommending this Hotel to anyone and I think we may even book it for our anniversary next year.  Easy access and trouble free access into central London.  We chose the Cable Car across the River to Excel and then a River Taxi into Westminster - a very enjoyable weekend.",5,2015,09,10
119,Pleasant Afternoon Tea,"Myself and my husband came to the hotel for an afternoon tea.
As we approached the hotel it is well presented, the lobby and surroundings were clean and shiny. We were seated near the window so was able to have some nice views of the surrounding river.
The tea itself was nice, the sandwiches were fresh, the scones were warm and the cakes delightful. I loved the way the tea was presented, they were in lovely triangular containers and had a nice full taste.
The staff were attentive and polite and overall it was a pleasant experience.",4,2015,09,10
119,Lovely place to stay,Amazing one night stay on here. Extremely clean and comfortable in a quiet location close enough to central London. Would recommend to anyone looking for somewhere different to stay in London. Would be perfect if going to the O2 ,5,2015,09,07
119,A treat,"I booked the Sunborn as a weekend treat. The floating hotel moored in London's Royal Victoria Dock is an absolute gem. From arrival you are greeted by professional smartly presented staff.

Centre piece of reception is a stunning chandelier and staircase.

Cabins can be either river or land facing. I booked a river facing executive room and wasn't disappointed. 

The large room had a comfy super kingsize bed, small table, sofa; flat screen tv, fridge, tea/coffee maker, iron and ironing board. There was also a lovely balcony. There is also an in room safe and tablet. The bathroom was compact and very clean but contained a large walk in shower and great toiletries and hairdryer. Plenty of power points in both UK and European sockets.

The yacht has a spa, but we didn't have time to use.

The Land's End restaurant was closed for a private function that evening but was open for breakfast. Breakfast was well presented   and contained both hot and cold items. Staff were extremely pleasant and attentive.

The Sundown bar was a nice place for pre dinner drinks - but could have more staff as we had to wait for some time to be served.

The hotel is easily reached by DLR and the Emirates Airline.

All in all a fantastic place to stay.  Thoroughly recommended.",5,2015,09,06
119,Disappointinnj,"Stayed two nights with a colleague as was attending an event at Excel. This is not a luxury hotel. Yes it's a different type of hotel and has so much potential but parts felt dated in particular the bar and restaurant area. The biggest disappointment was SERVICE! The bar staff were rude, slow and everything else in between! All night long, we'd order (which felt like we were a huge annoyance) wait way too long for the drinks and then within seconds were literally thrown the bill! The staff  hovered and kept coming to check. It was by far the most appalling service and experience. Also, that night it was house guests only, this is understandable but on entering the bar we were questioned in a way that felt like an interrogation! There are polite ways of asking! The uniqueness of the venus was outweighed by the bad service and won't be staying here again (nor will the tens of colleagues I was with).",3,2015,09,06
119,Great choice for a special treat,"We stayed at The Sunborn Yacht Hotel in 2007 and we were very disappointed when it disappeared quite soon after.  So I was very excited to hear that a new Sunborn was in town and booked it for my husband's birthday treat. It is sited the other end of the Excel Centre now which actually affords better views. I am told there  are currently 3 of these in the world. The other 2 in Gibraltar. One planned for Barcelona and there was one in Finland.  If you want the best experience the river view executive king size room with a balcony is a must. The rooms are huge with a comfortable lounge area and I love all the Scandinavian wood. You can order room service, book spa treatments or surf the net on the room pad. Or make coffee with the Lavazzo. Complimentary waters in the fridge. Ironing board, iron, slippers, robe, Molton Brown goodies. Comfy bed. Chairs on the balcony. Which we enjoyed both day and night! There's a plush bar offering a bar menu, sit outside and enjoy the view and a restaurant (set meal £32 as well as a la carte). Breakfast was fantastic value at £12.50, not only cheaper than in 2007 but also much better quality. Staff were delightful especially the young man at breakfast (whose brother had also visited in 2007!). Appreciated the handwritten letter of welcome along with chocolates. The yacht has a 10 year tenancy so get yourself down there, it really is a treat.",5,2015,09,06
119,Pathetic,"We are staying with our three year old daughter. ..we have been given a room below the dance floor. ..loud music and banging on the floor....
Party will go on until mid night means no sleep for us.... ridiculous.",2,2015,09,05
119,An amazing & very special surprise!,"I absolutely loved this floating hotel, very friendly & helpful staff. Our room was luxurious, spacious & spotlessly clean & comfortable. Molton Brown products in the shower room, an excellent shower & soft fluffy towels. We enjoyed a fabulous 3 course evening meal , beautifully presented in the Lands End restaurant & were lucky enough to have a table at the window to take in the London City skyline. We slept very well & stayed for the Buffet breakfast which was very good & a varied choice. We would definitely recommend this hotel..",5,2015,09,05
119,"Different to the usual ""hotels"" - well worth a look","Fantastic location right on the docklands, next to the Excel centre.  It did lack atmosphere, however.  While we were treated well by friendly staff, the experience wasn't ""warm"" overall.  If we had been with a large group of people it might have been different, but for us, while a wonderful experience with clean accommodation, fantastic views and high quality restaurants stumbling distance away, it was very ""touristy"" and staff were well trained, efficient and helpful but in a robotic, formal manner.  I'd recommend upgrading to a room with a balcony and water view - it was stunning!",4,2015,09,04
119,One night on the Sunborn,"A hotel on a yacht moored just next to the Excel centre in London's Docklands was where our friends from South Africa were staying. Being an East End lad whose Father worked in these docks when it was a vibrant working port, I was fascinated to see this hotel. We took the DLR rail link into Custom House and there she was in all her glory. After kissing the girlfriend to say ""Hello!"" we then boarded the yacht.
Great hotel in a great location and the reception staff were very friendly.
Immediate complimentary upgrade given as our friends were already aboard and going down a storm.
Fantastic night in a first class cabin.
I hope my Dad approved !",4,2015,09,03
119,Make your day special.,"Me and my wife had a wedding event on Sunborn. We were here for the first time and were very happy with entire process from start to finish.We couldn't have asked for a more enjoyable time than we had at Sunborn hotel. The views were marvelous, the food superb, and the stuff  fabulous. Our experience at Sunborn was excellent and we will definitely stay here again. Don't miss it.",5,2015,09,03
119,Amazing !!,"I was taken here as a surprise getaway by my boyfriend and it was amazing from the moment we walked in. The room overlooked the river, the bed was huge and really comfy and everything about it was special. The location was good for people visiting the exhibition centre and the train station is a 5 minute walk away to get into the heart of London. This unique place to stay is definitely worth a visit and we are already debating another trip in October.

",5,2015,09,02
119,Great place to stay,Lovely spacious  room even though one of the cheaper room.  Very comfortable beds with nice decor.  Friendly helpful staff.  Easy access into London. By the Excel building with cafe and restaurants.    Will def be going back.,5,2015,09,01
119,Overnight Stay!,"Absolutely beautiful and service was really good.

Only disappointment was that they were overbooked in the restaurant and I could not get breakfast early enough.

If you are going to get a room choose one on the Thames side. 

It is a really interesting lay out and just like a a Yacht on water.
Area not great for alternative restaurants.",4,2015,09,01
119,Excellent Hotel and Ideal for Stays in London,"A last minute trip to London to go to the Theatre and we decided to book the Sunborn. On arrival at the Hotel the staff were very professional but extremely friendly and welcoming.  The room was far larger than other 4 and 5 star hotels we have stayed in when we visit London.  We had a fabulous lunch in the Restaurant.  Again staff and service were first class.  The WiFi was free and fast so I could catch up with e-mails. After the theatre we returned to the hotel and had a late bar meal and drinks - again first class service. 

We travelled into London by train and we were concerned about getting to the hotel - it was really easy on the Underground - got the train to Bank and then London Dockland Railway to the Excel Centre.  We could have got a taxi but with traffic it would have probably take us the same amount of time. 

First visit.  Definitely not the last.  We will be using this hotel again.  Great Team at the Sunborn - wonderful customer service. 

Linda & Phil 
Chester",5,2015,09,01
119,Different but Perfect Accommodation,"Fantastic location with magnificent views.
The room was very clean and spacious with all comforts. 
The area was very quiet and access was easy as the overground & underground was 3 minutes walk from the yacht.
Food was good as well as prices.",5,2015,09,01
119,Short but sweet stay! ,"I'm always looking for somewhere/something a little different, and I found this with the Sunborn London! This was a surprise for my boyfriend's birthday, and it's safe to say he was impressed! We didn't have much contact with staff, but the reception staff were extremely hospitable. We had already made dinner plans, and made our own arrangements for breakfast as £19 each is a little steep! After dinner, we returned to the boat and had cocktails on the deck overlooking the city lights! ",4,2015,08,31
119,Ideal for short stay in London,"Perfect for short stay in London. all transport facilities very close by. Hotel excellent along with all staff, especially Nazma on reception who brightened the day ! Food on boat very good although breakfast a bit expensive at 19 pound, but good full english breakfast for a fiver just a hundred yards away. Will definitely visit again. Loved the cabin with a great view of Canary wharf especially at night when all lit up.",5,2015,08,31
119,Average,"Just returned from a 2 day/1 night stay on the Sunborn in London. I certainly wouldn't say it was luxury; pretty average really. Although the room is quite spacious and the bed was comfortable and nice bed linen, the decor was quite tired looking. The location is too far away from the lively atmosphere of London however on a plus the Emirates cable car trip is only 5 mins walk as is the O2. I booked 2 rooms and upon check in I was asked to pay in full for one of them which I queried as everywhere I've stayed before you pay upon departure. The balcony is not actually a balcony as such, it's 2 chairs where you can sit facing the side of the ship about 6 inches away from your knees but if standing you can actually see the London business district and the O2. Good if you're attending a conference at ExCel or gig at O2 otherwise stick to an area with more atmosphere and not so many tube stops and DLR journeys.  ",3,2015,08,30
119,25 th anniversary ,"Visited the hotel mid August and found it to be very luxurious
Rooms were great and fortunately for us the weather was great so we could sit out on the decks for drinks
Breakfast is very good and evening meal very nice
The only thing that I could fault was the service is a little slow at the bar and the restaurant but we received a complimentary drink for the wait which was nice
Would not have a problem recommending this hotel
We had a very nice stay on this boat
",4,2015,08,30
119,Great find and great price,"Booked a night here as we were flying the following day from nearby London City Airport. After an initial struggle finding the hotel we got checked in and were surprised by the comfort and quality of the rooms.
We loved being able to sit out in the evening with a cocktail overlooking the city.
For London this place is an absolute steal and ideal if you are looking for something different and quirky.",5,2015,08,29
119,Lovely treat for romantic break,"My husband and I stayed overnight for a romantic weekend. We stayed in the classic room without a balcony. Although our cabin window was of the dock and wasn't the greatest view, the room was luxurious. Bathroom and bedroom was decorated and cleaned to a high standard. We unfortunately were not able to book a table for dinner as we left it too late. So we dined at a restaurant recommended by the concierge , Top 1 Forever restaurant which was a 5 minute walk from the Yacht. Very good restaurant and a lovely view across to the O2 and cable cars.

We will definitely be returning. In fact we have already booked for our anniversary!",5,2015,08,28
119,business trip,"for somewhere a little bit different with plenty of style and class I recommend this great place . Just by Excel , but also close and easy to reach the bright lights of London City center . Excellent service and fantastic rooms",5,2015,08,28
119,Amazing!!,"Loved this!! stayed just one night, but could have stayed longer. Staying on the Sunborn the rooms are absolutely fantastic we had second floor river view with big port hole but would have balcony one next time will definatley stay again. Drinks are little expensive but just had a cocktail in the bar outside just coz. Plenty of Bars surrounding area.
Very pleasant experience.",5,2015,08,28
119,Can't believe not many people know about this gem!!,"My partner found the Sunborn via Booking.com. At first when he said it was a yacht hotel I was a bit sceptical, as I do suffer from sea sickness. However, I was wrong to be sceptical. The yacht was amazing and did not move, rock or sway during our entire stay as it is attached to the harbour. I would highly recommend the Sunborn. The service, the décor and ambience are perfect.",5,2015,08,28
119,Good room but balcony not great,"We had a family room with a balcony and view of the land side where we had planned to sit and enjoy the early evening. The problem is that when you sit in the chairs on the balcony you can't see much of a view (you see just the tops of buildings and the sky) because the balcony protection barrier is a grey metal construction; to see the main square you need to stand up. However, the room was nice, big enough for the 3 of us and a decent size shower room. The main bed was comfortable the kids sofa bed not so, it is the type where the sofa seat just pulls out - no mattress. Good service from room staff who were very friendly. Nice area on deck outside the bar for evening drinks and a meal, service here was very slow. Nice and quiet in the area at night. Tesco express and Custom house tube just a few minutes walk which was useful.",4,2015,08,26
119,An excellent hotel with top hygiene standards and very friendly and helpful staff,We stayed here for two nights and found the staff to be most helpful and friendly on reception.  The service in the bar was a bit slow but still very friendly.  The breakfast had ample to chose from and no queues.  The rooms were an excellent size and standard and one of the cleanest hotels I have ever stayed in.  Would thoroughly recommend it.,5,2015,08,26
119,What a treat.,"If u want too do something different.  Please go too this sunborn. Unfortunately this is the only one I have being too.  Absolutely lovely.  The rooms very very nice.  Lounge and diningroom lovely and very nice food. I feel the only downfall was that it had a small lounge or maybe it's only requires one lounge.  But very very nice.  Everything was good, staff, food and service excellent.",5,2015,08,26
119,A great surprise birthday treat,"It was my birthday recently, and my girlfriend decided to book a surprise trip. I had no idea what it maybe, apart from it wasn't far from North Greenwich station...
There are some real amazing activities you can do around the local area of Greenwich before heading towards to hotel, for example we climbed across and on top of the O2, in which you can see the Yaught hotel from the roof. You can also fligh over in the Emirates Cable carts taking in the views of London.

The Yaught is an impressive sight, when my girlfriend walked passed it and said here's your birthday treat, i thought she was joking! It's very unusual and has a classy feel to it.
The decor inside is pretty breathtaking. The first sight is the double stair case going up a deck. The staff are very friendly on greeting, they even gave us 2 complimentary glasses of champagne as it was my birthday :-)

There is a spa on board, although we didn't venture to see what it was like.
The views from the ship are real good seeing the city, the O2, The Gherkin, The Shard and more.

We had dinner on board. The dishes are very posh, Ranging from melted goat cheese, Gnocchi, and more. They were full of flavour. Our set menu included a glass of champagne £32 each, Quite pricey, but its once in a blue moon and kind of expect that price. The service was quite slow though, with others around us complaining about waiting between servings so long.

The room itself is probably the biggest we've stayed in, surprising as i didn't expect that for a yaught. The decor in the room was lovely, lots of mirrors if you like that, and a nice sofa and table. Also if you can make sure you have a window facing out towards the thames as the view is much nicer, and feels more private from passers by. I loved the shower soaps, Molten Brown i believe.

The next day we literally sat on the deck bar all day, had some lunch and some drinks looking out over the thames, perfect for a lazy day.

I would recommend for any couple to have a romantic and different weekend together. Weekend is probably more than enough time for this special hotel. I would go back, but not for a little while, and more so would go back to have a special meal with friends or a client maybe.",4,2015,08,25
119,Excellent views and quiet area not too far from the city centre.,"Stayed with my 7 year old son in July and found the room to be spacious , clean while the staff were helpful and professional. The prices on board weren't too bad considering ti was London. Would visit again.",5,2015,08,24
119,Sunboring,"My boyfriend and I visited for the spa and afternoon tea package. The spa therapists were lovely and the treatment was good, but ultimately the whole place is seriously lacking any charisma. The yacht is eerily quiet, the location somewhat pointless, and staff seemed uninspired. Although I can't blame them, I would be too in such a stale environment. 
The afternoon tea was pretty tasteless, not great quality and I agree with an earlier review which mentioned that the sandwiches were hard and already drying out. The charm that generally comes hand in hand with an afternoon tea was charred by the bland, chunky crockery which felt more suitable for a conference room, and the champagne we were served was clearly from a bottle which had been opened earlier as it was quite flat. 
Unfortunately disappointing - you can find the same thing elsewhere but of a better standard and in a more atmospheric location. ",3,2015,08,24
119,A nice Quirky hotel,"Stayed in the Sunborn Yacht hotel as a birthday (and engagement :-) ) treat! I love a boat so this was a perfect idea and very unusual.
All the staff encountered throughout our stay were pleasant. Especially the reception staff who would go that extra mile to help if needed. The rooms/cabin were huge with a big living space and nice bathroom.
We stayed in a dock side room and the view was a little disappointing. The weather was not great and the only thing for us to look at was the Excel building and a few floating crisp packets in the water. This didn't matter though as we wanted to explore the rest of the yacht and surrounding areas which didn't disappoint (and the sun even shone).
We didn't eat on the yacht but enjoyed some drinks in the relaxed bar over-looking Canary Wharf.
Overall we had an amazing time and i would recommend, although I would suggest a riverside view.",4,2015,08,24
119,alternative luxury!,"Booked for surprise for husbands 40th birthday. staff were warm and approachable ( a big thank you to Maryiam who made our stay extra special) 
The main lobby was stunning with it's glass staircase and chandelier.
The room was huge with a balcony view of the dock. Rooms are well equipped with lavazzo coffee machine and bedside craze tablet to browse. Molton brown toiletries in the shower room.
We took the emirates cable car over to the O2 then an all day hop on hop off thames clipper down to the south bank in central London.
Breakfast in the morning was splendid. fresh breads and pastries as well as continental meats and cheese along with hot cooked food.",5,2015,08,24
119,Anniversary weekend,"Fabulous hotel for our anniversary! We had a lovely welcome on arrival at check in and because it was a very hot day they provided cold jugs of water. The room was beautiful & spacious, the bed very comfortable. We didn't eat in the restaurant but there are lots of nice restaurants nearby. Checking out, we had a lovely young lady who asked if we had been there for a special occasion, we mentioned our anniversary and she said if we had mentioned it at check in we could have had an upgrade!! I have already booked again for my husband's birthday in January. Only little niggle is not enough coffee & milk in the room and a bottle of water would have been nice as it was such a hot day.",5,2015,08,23
119,Wonderful!,"My wife booked here as a 2 night surprise around a concert we were going to at the O2.

This stands out as being really different amongst the developments in Docklands.

Felt really cool to be entering this faux yacht.

Great entrance, friendly staff, well equipped cabins (just need somewhere to dry towels) and lovely to stand on the balcony and watch the river.

Breakfast was great value too.

Strongly recommended.",5,2015,08,23
119,Disappointing Couples Massage  ,"My partner booked a full body couples massage and afternoon tea as a birthday treat via Groupon. The staff at main reception and at the restaurant (where we had our afternoon tea) were very friendly, but it was the 'couples massage' which let our experience down. 

Upon arriving, there were two ladies at reception, one of which who was a blonde slim lady that very unprofessional. We heard an open conversation where the two were discussing who they would like to massage - my partner or I. After choosing to massage my partner, the blonde masseuse totally ignored my presence and took my partner into a separate room for his treatment.

As the massage was listed as a 'couples massage' we both were surprised that the massages didnt take place in one room together (an important detail omitted in the advert).

I am giving 2 stars because the afternoon tea was lovely - Spa experience let us down so would have rated higher. So if you are are couple looking to book a 'couples massage' I would go elsewhere.

 ",2,2015,08,23
119,Unique place to stay in London,"I booked this hotel for my husband's birthday. I had booked for us to climb the O2 and wanted somewhere special to stay. The Sunborn is a beautiful yacht hotel based in Royal Victoria Dock. The staff were so friendly; I'm not sure I've met friendlier. The rooms were vast and really did have the wow factor. We had a river view and could even spy the O2 from our room. The shower was excellent with lovely Molton Brown products. There was a coffee machine and a large sofa to lounge on. The bar had an outside deck and we were given 50% off our first drinks. Sitting on the outside deck sipping a cocktail on a beautiful summers day while looking at Canary Wharf in the distance is a pretty lovely way to spend an afternoon. We were very close to many restaurants and the Emirates cable car over to the O2, so the hotel is perfectly situated. Using the DLR is really simple and makes traveling to the Docklands super easy. We would recommend this stunning and unique hotel to everyone and will be back again.",5,2015,08,23
119,1 Night Bought as a present for our 30th Wedding Anniversary,"Lovely hotel very clean and spacious. Reception staff very polite and helpful. Room was quite big and decorated to a high standard, even had an iPad in the room. Bathroom lovely with Molton Brown toiletries. We had a balcony so was lovely to look out on to the London skyline, with the cable cars to the right. Breakfast in dining room was of good quality, it was a buffet service with the usual cereals, pastries, fruit's smoked salmon cheese salami, and traditional English cooked breakfast. We enjoyed our stay, we just felt it was not the best location that is only our own personal opinion.",4,2015,08,23
119,10 year wedding anniversary,Such an amazing place !!! When we checked in the reception staff very kindly upgraded us to the front of the boat In an executive suite it was fantastic we had our own jacuzzi and sauna !!!! It was all so very clean and staff were all so friendly ! Would defentley recommend this boat as it was very enjoyable and relaxing.,5,2015,08,22
119,Lovely experience,"We cruise regularly so we were really looking forward to staying at this hotel as it resembles a cruise ship on a smaller scale.
The hotel is lovely, a feel of luxury and everyone was helpful and friendly.
We travelled down from Chester without the children to spend some time together as a couple and visit the sights of London.
We booked a river view executive room and it lived up to expectations from looking on the internet. We were given room 2014. Room was very spacious, very clean and comfortable. Lovely view out to the right of London sky line, emirates airline. City airport was to the left but it really wasn't noisy with planes flying over.
Unfortunately we could hear all the footsteps above us as we were directly under the reception area which is laminated. I couldn't sleep with the noise so we asked to be moved. They only had dockside but I was happy to move that night as I just wanted to go to sleep. We moved to 5031. The view isn't as bad as people have made out but obviously preferred the riverside as that is what we paid for. The room seemed slightly smaller and no couch in this one. In the morning we went to reception to see if they had any river view rooms available. Nazma was on reception and she was lovely, she managed to find us a river view room with balcony, room number 4038 right next to the suite. This room was set up on the romantic package so I went back as I didn't think this was set up for us and it wasn't. We were going into London for the day and Nazma said she would sort it for us.

On return at around 8pm we were allowed to keep 4038 and she said enjoy the romantic package, unfortunately the maid had cleared it all! This room didn't have carpet but wooden flooring, but was still as lovely as the first room we were in. Room was lovely and quiet and no footsteps above us. 
We enjoyed a drink in the bar on the balcony area outside and then we went to our room and just sat out on the balcony and enjoyed the peace and quiet from the hustle and bustle from London City.
Breakfast was lovely, enough for a vegetarian too. A little bit disappointed it is all buffet for the cooked which we expected waiter service but this didn't spoil our time here.
Overall we had a lovely time here and would love to come back again one day if visiting the area.",5,2015,08,22
119,Good for relaxing ,"Fabulous hotel..

119,pure luxury,"we stayed at the sunborn as part of a coach party, usually this means you get the very basics, but not on this occasion, the room we had was amazing, king size bed, flat screen tv, a tablet with free internet access, a lounge area with sofa even a coffee machine, it was all tastefully decorated and spotlessly clean. the staff were very polite and helpful, the one down side if you can call it that was the time it took for the food to come to the table after we ordered, we waited over an hour just for a burger and fries, which meant we had to miss an evening tour with the rest of the coach party, that said we did enjoy sitting outside sipping cocktails and relaxing, next time would maybe try one of the many eating places nearby.it has to be said though that when the food did arrive it was faultless the best burger ive had in a long time so  worth the wait, we had the buffet breakfast which was amazing, presented well, plenty of choice, and cooked to perfection, the whole experience ""on board"" was brilliant, would highly recommend, thanks to all concerned for making it a stay to remember",5,2015,08,21
119,Friendly Opulence,"This really is a fabulous experience. Sadly only had one night in this wonderful hotel, but will return. 'Cabins' are large and immaculate - none of the scuffs or scratches you come to expect, and with everything you could want laid on. I shared a twin room with my 16 year old granddaughter and (unusually) she was very impressed, especially with the bedside tablet, the coffee machine and the fridge. The huge mirrors were a big hit too. Our schedule didn't allow for a meal in the restaurant, but we had a great bar meal which was reasonably priced for London. There was a rather long wait for the meal to arrive, but the busy staff are all so pleasant and helpful I still rate at 5 stars overall. Breakfast in the restaurant was impressive and well served with a wonderful choice. Thoroughly recommended.",5,2015,08,20
119,Excellent hotel would highly recommend,"I stayed at the sunborn last Saturday night with my two sisters. We were going out for the evening in London and had travelled down from manchester.
On arrival we were delighted to hear that our booking had been upgraded to an amazing suite which included a huge bathroom with hydro bath and sauna, a huge decked area for sun lounging and large dining/living area and bedrooms. We had a great time living in luxury even if it was only for one night. 
The staff at the hotel provided excellent service were all very helpful and friendly.
I would and already do recommend the Sunborn to everyone who is looking for a hotel in London. Prices are comparable with other more traditional hotels where I believe you wouldn't get the same service or overall experience.
Thanks sunborn we'll be back again in the future.

119,A perfect 21st treat ,"I stayed here with my mum as she had booked for my 21st birthday treat, the staff as soon as we came in were amazing they wished me a happy birthday! We got a beautiful room with a balcony, and even had a letter wishing me a lovely birthday and a fantastic stay and chocolates, I absolutely loved that personal touch, thank you! Being near to the excel there was a lovely tapas bar we went to to celebrate called tapa tapa. We loved the fact that it wasn't in the busy hustle of London but was near enough on the underground or DLR to get to. I'd like to say a massive thank you to the effort all the staff put in for us. I'd definitely visit again and would recommend to anyone. Had a lovely time. Thank you! X",5,2015,08,20
119,'Amazing unique experience',"We stayed in the executive suite last week for two nights, on our honeymoon and we could not have wished for a better hotel. Pure luxury! The suite was amazing with outstanding facilities. We received a warm welcome when we arrived at reception. All the staff were professional, accommodating, helpful and friendly. We can't wait to return to this beautiful yacht. It was a wonderful experience!",5,2015,08,20
119,Treated like Kings & Queens,"I booked a Classic Room for my boyfriend and I as a surprise on his 27th birthday last night. The room was spacious with a table and sofa, the lushest carpet imaginable and a beautiful hand written note on the bed wishing us a wonderful stay from the manager... We were blown away from the minute we walked in. The reception and interiors are all very classic and slightly reminiscent of a 'Titanic' style era.
The food at the restaurant, Lands End, was divine. Artfully presented, amazing flavours and the butteriest mash potato! We'd been given vouchers on arrival for 50% off our first drinks so we ordered cocktails, which were lovely. We could not fault the waiting staff in any way, I've never experienced such polite, friendly service.
During our stay we had our dessert brought up to our room, a bucket of ice brought to us by room service before our meal and even our full english breakfast brought up in the morning at no extra cost. I mentioned to one of the waiting staff that it was my boyfriend's birthday and they brought over a beautiful little truffle dessert with 'Happy Birthday' written in caramel... We were so gutted to leave this morning, we're already talking about going back and getting one of the executive suites with spa access.
Our stay really couldn't have been improved in any way, I will remember it forever.",5,2015,08,20
119,"Cancelled, unprofessional, disappointing","This hotel is absolutely disgraceful. I booked my room in February for my partners birthday in july, paid extra for an excutive suit with thanes view. They decided to email me 2 days before arrival saying they have to move me to a dock view. 
The email itself was disgraceful and so thoughtless. I was excited to stay at this hotel for the experience and was very disappointed how they treated me.  It was 300 room for 1 night so I cancelled as i was not getting what i paid for. I had no present to give my partner and had to cancel our arrangements. Wrote a letter and had no response either. 
AWFUL",1,2015,08,20
119,One night stay ,We stayed for one night as part of a theatre package and had a fabulous time. The yacht was great from the moment we arrived until we left and we look forward to coming back. The service was excellent and although we didn't use the bar it seemed OK. The room was good a few stains on the carpet but they can't change them every time some one spills something but the beds were comfortable and spotless. Having read some reviews before we found the breakfast had everything you need and was replenished often. We had a great time and will be back soon.,5,2015,08,20
119,How to feel like a millionaire!,"Booked a 2 night romantic break. Came across this on a hotel booking site & thought it looked a bit different - and it is! Really spacious 'cabins', ours had a view over the docks water towards Greenwich Village. Very opulent interior. Really looks the part, and it is! Try the bar or restaurant, you will not be disappointed.a bit out of the city, but with the efficient clean DLR didn't seem to matter. I hope we can find an excuse to come again. ",5,2015,08,19
119,Floating Palace ,"I booked an Executive King Deluxe Cabin with Balcony for my wife's birthday.

Our Cabin
Enormous and Stylish are two words that best describe what we discovered when we first opened the door. Dark polished wood a carpet deep enough to loose your toes in.A low bench big enough for two suitcases. Above the large television two smoked glass doors front a cabinet for glasses below the television two dark wood doors hide a fridge to the right and a kettle with complementary tea sugar and hot chocolate to the left.
Beside the TV cabinet is a desk/dressing table with a phone and a coffee maker.
Three large dark wood doors open to reveal wardrobes with hanging space to one side with crisp white robes aka dressing gowns and shelves to the other and a safe. 
Yes the hotel is designed to look like a yacht but please don't expect to find life jackets. 
Although the bed isn't quite large enough to play Baseball on there's plenty of room for other games. ""You chose""
Two dark wood bedside cabinets complete the room 

Bathroom 
One large sink toilet and a very large shower. More fluffy white towels than  we could possibly need.But this is luxury remember. Milton Brown Toiletries complementary of course.

Services 
The Yacht Hotel provide a Tablet Computer 
Guests can book Spa Treatments or Order Room Service and even surf the net 

Car Parking 
My last visit didn't go very well. I called in at the Sunborn because A I wanted to know exactly where the hotel is located and B I wanted to ask about car parking.The Website says car parking £10 a night. I needed to know weather or not I had to precook a space.
I approached the reception desk. I introduced myself and started to make my enquiry.I didn't get very far the moment I said I have a reservation for the. The two people behind the desk stopped listening. One of them turned to walk away the other one started tapping away on a keyboard and looking at a VDU screen and then asked me for my name. It was obvious what he was doing. Turning away+using a computer while I'm still speaking=Not paying attention to me.
It took far too long to get their focus back on the reason for my being there.Finally I got the information I desired. The Sunborn doesn't offer car parking the nearest car parking is at the multi storey adjacent to the Crown Plaza on Western Gateway. 

The Website 
The Website still says car parking at the Sunborn £10 a night     

Would I recommend Yes Absolutely
Would I return.          Yes I've already booked ",5,2015,08,19
119,something missing,"Quirky hotel...spotless, stunning to look at internally and externally...lacked atmosphere...the balcony was disappointingly small , the breakfast ant £19.50 each was well overpriced and our wedding anniversary which the hotel knew about was not acknowledged in any way..the staff were however wonderful",4,2015,08,19
119,Pretty and nothing else,"The sunborn is a beautiful hotel. Very beautiful. But that's about it really. It looks nice. 
After a while the novelty does wear off. 
There isn't alot to do in this hotel, the restaurant doesn't have an exciting menu and is quite expensive. The bar area again looks good but this is irrelevant, when you are faced with very slow service and very badly made cocktails. 
Some members of staff bend over backwards to really assist and make your stay enjoyable, while others pretty much shove you out of the way to get their tasks done. 
I requested a last minute romantic turn down service. Understanding it was last minute I did not expect the world. I was informed the team needed 24 hours in order to produce towel swans and rose petals. Interesting. 
To finish off the sunborn is located near the excel exhibition centre. Now any Londoner worth their weight in fish and chips wouldn't primarily choose this area to have a relaxing weekend away. It's very heavy on the tourists, parking costs £15 for 24 hours (as standard), the area is filled with mediocre restaurants and the views are not the best in London.
The Sunborn is a mixed bag. I'm sure off the appearance alone some people will love it. But for the price range of this hotel, there are some true gems in london which far exceed the level of service offered at the Sunborn.

It is a must see, but not a must stay.",3,2015,08,19
119,Overall a lovely experience which we will repeat in the near future.,We stayed with our two teenagers and were impressed by the helpful service provided in organising two cabins next to each other. The staff were always pleasant and we took advantage of a special offer for breakfast which was excellent value for money. The rooms were spacious and comfortable and the location of the Sunborn perfect for business and sightseeing alike. ,5,2015,08,19
119,The best we have stayed in London,"We stayed one night and it was fantastic. The staff were lovely and the boat was immaculate. 
We had cocktails at the back of the boat overlooking the dock and the O2 Arena.
We watched the international Rugby game in our great room on the wifi which was excellent. I have nothing but praise for this hotel.
We will be back.",5,2015,08,18
119,Excellent,"The Sunborn Hotel is very novel idea, having stayed at the Sunborn in Gibraltar we decided we would stay at the London one too a few weeks later for my husbands birthday, it is a very lovely hotel clean and the rooms were very spacious, the bathrooms were clean but are a little on the small side, the doors are also heavy and do bang, we had a room in the end view of the Thames, we changed rooms due to the stains on the carpet in the first room, housekeeping do need to improve on this. The staff were all very friendly and helpful and the bar staff were very efficient, we didn't have breakfast so I cant comment on this, I would stay again next time were in the area",4,2015,08,18
119,Amazing!,"We had the most amazing weekend on the sunborn yacht, originally planned to stay one night but extended it to two as we were enjoying it so much. Nazma was especially helpful on reception, went that extra mile with her kindness. Best weekend.",5,2015,08,18
119,Going to the O2,Very pleasant feeling when turning the corner and seeing the hotel it's nice to be different and this boat certainly was the staff were excellent very welcoming and attentive the location for the O2 was fantastic as it included a trip on the cable car which was very quick and easy.,5,2015,08,18
119,Loved this Floating Hotel,"Im not normally gushing, i can usually find something a miss even with the best of places but i just loved this hotel. Its a quirky thing, staying on a Yacht anyway and it has the feel of a bygone era in its decor and lovely level of service! The rooms aren't enormous but they are just right and have everything you might need for a good trip. The bed was comfy, room service was good, Molton Brown toiletries were replenished each day and house keeping was efficient and seamless. We didn't manage to get into the restaurant (make sure you book if you want to eat there) but we had snacks in the bar which were fab. Location wise its literally next door to Excel which means there are tubes taxis and buses within easy reach (although i ubered our way round) The Cable cars are within walking distance and there is a great Chinese just across the way. Two nights were perfect for exploring  bit and relaxing watching the world go by on the river.",5,2015,08,17
119,Excellent,"Great room, food and staff. Beautiful views and luxurious surroundings. Would stay again.Very clean bathroom, lovely tea and coffee facilities in a very spacious room. Evening meal was excellent and breakfast just as good with great view of O2 and Victoria dock",5,2015,08,17
119,Celebration of my sister's special birthday,"Our stay at the Sunborn was part of a package I put together as a sister thing. The staff were absolutely superb, so helpful, acknowledging the celebration by upgrading our room. The whole experience could not have been better. It contributed in a big way to making the whole day very special for a very special person. Thank you so much to the reception staff member who looked after us on the evening of the 14th July. You were a star!",5,2015,08,17
119,Saturday night luxury indulgence,"We booked with Secret Escapes for a one-night stay on a Saturday night and had a great time. Our rate included a yacht executive room (with balcony and river view), 3-course dinner with a glass of champagne and breakfast the next morning.

The room (cabin) was spacious with a large bed, sofa, coffee table, TV, fridge (not stocked as a mini-bar, but with complimentary bottled water), tea and coffee making facilities, wardrobe with safe, iron, etc. and bathrobes and slippers. The balcony was cosy, but with space for the door to open outwards and 2 chairs, great view of the dock, with the O2 dome and cable cars off to the rear of the ship. The bathroom had a walk-in shower and Molton Brown toiletries. Instead of a folder of hotel information there is a tablet computer which also acts as an alarm clock, and with the option to order room service, etc. All in all the sort of luxury we expected.

We had cocktails in the bar before dinner, looking out over the great view to the rear of the ship, towards the dome. Service in the bar was quick and efficient. Then we went upstairs to the restaurant for our meal. I really like the way the tables for two are all set so that both people are facing the wonderful view. Our 3-course meal was great, very tasty and with a good selection to choose from, all beautifully presented. The wine list looked extensive, but after our cocktail we chose to stick with our included glass of champagne and have a glass of dessert wine with our desserts instead, which was excellent. We dined at 7:30pm, and there was a function on board which we could hear until the music was turned down. The service was good at the start of the evening, but we had a bit of a wait for our desserts, probably due to catering for the other function, and we overheard later diners being told that their main courses would be delayed. There was also a slight problem with our bill at the end of the evening, but it was promptly rectified.

Breakfast was good too, we made sure we arrived in the restaurant about 8:30am, before the Sunday morning rush, and had a nice leisurely meal with that great view again. It was very busy by the time we left. All the food was buffet-style with a good choice of everything. The food warmers rely on people closing the lids when they have served themselves, which not everyone did, so the food could lose its heat through no fault of the staff. My husband particularly enjoyed the pastries.

We were very impressed with Sunborn London, and really enjoyed our luxury treat.",4,2015,08,17
119,A Fantastic Exerience,"Booked a night's stay at The Sunborn in a August 2015.

It is a great experience and nice to be away from the usual hustle and bustle of the London streets.  Very calming and a pleasant atmosphere.

If you are visiting the O2 or The Excel, this hotel is perfectly located for these venues.  You can even catch the cable-car (Emirates Fly) over the river, which is a far more relaxing way to travel than catching the train.

Our room was very spacious (Executive Room with a river view) with a small balcony.  I liked the thoughtful facilities that were provided in the room; European and UK plug sockets, Lavazza coffee machine, a tablet to surf the net and free wifi :-)

The receptionists were very friendly and helpful and the venue was spotlessly clean.

The breakfast was of a good standard with a great selection of hot buffet, breads/danish pastries, cereals, juices, fruit, etc.

I would definitely recommend staying at this hotel",5,2015,08,17
119,Sitting on The Dock of the bay...........so the song goes. But definitely not wasting time!!!!,"The Sunborn is an impressive hotel for it's location, sheer style and elegance. The whole experience was amazing.

A dock view with a balcony is a must!!! The rooms/cabins are very clean and well presented.  Towels and sheets are crisp and white.  Each floor you enter is bright, super clean and not a detail forgotten.

The staff are smart and more than helpful - Nothing is too much trouble for any member of staff.  The Receptionist on arrival and departure was polite and helpful. The bar area is very comfortable and the staff are excellent.  We had an evening meal included in our package - The waiting staff were very professional. The food was good and the choices were also good.

I would highly recommend The Sunborn for a night away or just for a drink whilst visiting the area.

Thank you to everyone at the Sunborn for a wonderful experience.",5,2015,08,17
119,Great hotel,"Great hotel with great staff.
Good food and services. 
Well worth a visit for a drink or meal or book in to stay. This hotel is right next to the London Excel Centre and the Emerates cable car ride. So great access to the 02 Centre and the Thames River boat services.",5,2015,08,16
119,Fantastic Hotel,We stayed here for two nights to celebrate my 40th birthday and were not disappointed.  Stunning hotel with friendly staff. We had two riverside rooms with balconies with the added entertainment of a triathlon to watch and people channeling their inner bond on water jet packs.  From our rooms and the restaurant we had a great view of the O2 and watching the Emirates cable cars is strangely hypnotising.  We ate in the bar on the first night and had a really tasty burger and the buffet breakfast was really good.  Will definitely be returning!,5,2015,08,16
119,What an excellent hotel!,"What an excellent hotel, cannot recommend this highly enough, friendly and welcoming staff, fabulous rooms, great breakfast. 
On board facilities are great. Also is very clean and well maintained.
Will definitely stay again.",5,2015,08,14
119,Beautiful Birthday treat,"Just back from a surprise weekend in London. We spent a night on the Sunborn and had a wonderful time. We had an executive room which was spacious and came with 6 ft bed, sofa, large TV, fridge, coffee machine, safe and balcony overlooking the dock. The bathroom had double shower, toiletries and hair dryer with robes and slippers. Everywhere was spotless. The balcony is really just for standing on as it is metal and has no chairs to sit out, as you might find on a cruise ship.

My husband  had asked in advance if we could have access to the room slightly earlier than usual as we had a matinee theatre booking, and when we arrived at 12, the room was ready. We found staff really helpful in almost all areas. The only exception was the bar in the evening where service was a little slow and less friendly. After a lengthy wait the chap brought the wrong drink! 

There was music on the top deck with people wearing headphones dancing. This could be viewed from the outside deck of the bar below but we didn't go up.

We paid extra for breakfast the following morning and enjoyed a lovely buffet breakfast looking out over the water.  Breakfast at weekends is slightly cheaper than in the week. £12.50 per person I think, which seemed reasonable as we were able to choose from cereal, full English and continental options, with plenty of fresh fruit too. 

The Boat is docked very close to ExCel so is perfect if you are attending an event there or possibly at the O2 which was on the far side of the water but could be viewed from the rear of the boat.

We used our contactless debit cards on the underground and DLR to travel between docklands and the city centre, and found it cheaper than purchasing the 1 day travel card.

Something a little different which made a very special weekend.",5,2015,08,14
119,"different sure, but  disappointing.","Different sure, but ultimately disappointing.  The location is  quite strange, but easily accessible by DLR, with the closest station only 2 minutes walk from the ship. Rooms  onboard are spacious and comfortable, with good sized beds, but the shower room is small . The public rooms again are quite spacious and comfortable, with a nice open deck off the bar.  It's the bar where the problems start, as three ice was really quite dreadful. We went to eat there on our first night, but left after waiting 25 minutes without being offered as much as a drink. It's waiter service only, so you can't go to the bar yourself to speed things up. Staff in the bar were seemingly plentiful to cope , but seemed  either disinterested or lazy. 
Breakfast is unexciting, and the hot food in the buffet was lying for a long time, even when going early to the breakfast room.
All in all a hotel that offers something different , and with Excel being unused while we were there, the rooms were very quiet, which is unusual for London, but ultimately it let itself down with poor staff and lazy catering.
",3,2015,08,13
119,2 night stay,"My wife and I cannot rate this hotel highly enough. Great location , the staff where fab and couldn't do enough for us.  The decor and overall quality of this floating hotel was excellent. We have stayed in London a few times now but this was something else , will definitely go back again ,o and the river view was great ",5,2015,08,13
119,A Hotel with a difference ,"What a great hotel, the Yacht was moored in the Royal Victoria Docks adjacent to numerous resturants. 
The Cable Car over to the Greenwich area is at the end of the docks, this is well worth a visit with great views of the London skyline. Although the City Airport is very close the noise didn't bother us in the Yacht, the rooms on the Yacht are well fitted out and amazingly quiet, the staff very helpful. We only stayed one night but will be returning in a few months for another weekend break there.",5,2015,08,13
119,"Wow! Lovely setting for drinks, looking forward to returning for an overnight stay","Came here this afternoon for drinks.  The yacht/hotel is absolutely stunning.  The staff were all friendly, professional and attentive.   Good choice of drinks from an extensive bar menu, with of course table service.  Beautiful on a sunny afternoon- depending upon which direction you look you could be in the Med! I am looking forward to returning for an overnight stay",5,2015,08,12
119,Excellent location for London City Airport,"I was looking for a hotel close to London City Airport as I had an early flight the next day and I came across Sunborn London.  I stayed for one night and had a very pleasant experience.  Our cabin which was the basic one, was bigger and nicer than I thought it would be and I had a great nights sleep. I also ate in the restaurant and the food was very good also.  All of the staff I encountered were lovely and very genuine.  I would recommend and stay here again if and when I fly out of LCA.",4,2015,08,12
119,Amazing,Just came back from a couple of days break with Sunburn London although out of London easy to get into London by tube or river cruise. Rooms were good size restaurant amazing would recommend You will hear the noise from London Airport but all stops at night so not a problem.,5,2015,08,12
119,Breakfast let down and plates cold!,This is the second time this year that I have stayed on the Sunborn yacht and although the interior and bedrooms are very impressive when it comes to the breakfasts they are very disappointing! I appreciate they start serving at 6.a.m and we arrived (four of us) at 8.am but  it was obvious that the food had been left standing quite a long time and was only lukewarm. The plates were also cold. This was also the case when I stayed earlier in the year and thought things might have improved!,4,2015,08,11
119,Anniversary celebration,"Wow  what a fantastic hotel.   Yacht hotel to be precise.  Great deco and quite opulent.  Felt like we were on a cruise although it was moored would have loved it to go down the Thames. The staff were pleasant and helpful.  The yacht had up to date mod cons.  Would definitely  recommend this for a glamorous getaway.  Had spa facilities but no gym, steam or sauna but they were not needed was good for just relaxing on deck.  Luckily we had a great sunny Sunday afternoon which made you feel like you were on the Med or in Dubai.",5,2015,08,11
119,Dreadful afternoon tea!!!,"My husband & I treated ourselves to a spa package. This included a deep tissue massage, which was lovely & I would definitely recommend, & an afternoon tea which was dreadful!!!
Once seated in restaurant we were shown the menu & told we would not have to choose a tea blend as all would be presented at our table. Our food was served & our tea didn't arrive until we were a third of the way through our meal. A few teabags,no loose leaf, arrived of different teas with some hot water. We both wanted the same blend but as there was only one teabag of each my husband had to wait quite a long time for a member of staff to appear so that we could ask for another teabag.  Only one teabag for a large teapot, dishwater!!! 
The sandwiches were bland & starting to dry out. The scones were hard, dry & over baked & served with a small amount of strawberry jam & marmalade!!!.  The cakes were small & stodgy due to under baking.  At no time did any staff ask us if we wanted more tea or water or if everything was ok.  
My advise would be to give this yacht a very wide berth!!!",3,2015,08,11
119,Fantastic hotel,"Absolutely loved my 3 night stay. The rooms are magic, beds so comfortable, cocktails on the stern.....views over London and the docks are special
the staff are very accommodating and professional and I want to go back",5,2015,08,11
119,Lovely nights stay on the sunborn,"Me and my daughters thought we would treat ourself and stay some where completely different this year.  I had heard about the sunborn from a friend and after her great reviews I thought I would investigate. 

On arrival we were all very excited. We were welcomed by the staff professionally and were very friendly. Our room was lovely and very clean, only a stain on the carpet. It was a good size with good facilities and it also had a small balcony.  We went exploring, which was good fun! 

There was plenty for us to do in the area. We went on the cable cars over to the 02 and spent the evening there. There are plenty of places to eat and drink and lots of free fun activities for the kids. The next day we were spoilt by the triathlon competition in the Excel, lots to do and see. 

Breakfast in the Sunborn was lovely! Great choices for adults and children and good value for money. The Sunborn is easy to get to from Stratford station and is definitely worth a visit, I would love to go again!m",5,2015,08,11
119,Lovely Stay,"We arrived for our special stay , the hotel looks very impressive and very unusual experience to be saying in a cabin !! The reception staff where very helpful especially Victoria, we where early and our room wasn't ready so we had a lovely snack and drink at the bar and the terrace, the staff where very quick and helpful.. we booked our evening meal and retired to our room which was a lovely cabin on the 4th floor with the Thames view and a small balcony , the room was large and a very comfy bed. Dinner was fantastic, we where sat by the window and lovely views of the London city all lit up, my partner did order he pork belly and was bought the duck by mistake but they quickly sorted this out , the staff where all excellent , we had a very romantic evening there , i would thouroughly recommend a stay here even after reading other peoples negative comments on the slow service etc, we did not receive this at all, infact quite the opposite and we would like to thank everyone including Andreas Stys the General manager for our lovely letter in our room wishing us an enjoyable stay of which we certainly did have , thank you all .",5,2015,08,11
119,WOW!!!,"What a fantastic yacht, so clean, staff friendly, we got an offer on the price, not sure if we could afford to do this very often....would love to though. ideal for that special times.  would recommend",5,2015,08,11
119,What a shame.....,"One gets a very impressive scene as you arrive at the dock and walk through to the lift to take you to reception. Lots of glass, and gleaming woodwork and chandeliers. Some areas of the public areas were roped off, so could not view the river area from the top. The Reception staff were friendly and most helpful. The cabin/room was very spacious and could not be faulted.

However the same cannot be said for either the food or the service in the restaurant and frankly has coloured the whole view of my stay at The Sunbourn Yacht. The evening meal of salmon and the accompanying diced vegetables were over cooked and grey. The pork belly vegetables were hard and could not even be cut with a knife and fork. I swear the the chef had smeared ketchup as part of the presentation? The service at breakfast was a shambles. No milk came with the beverages, only after prompting two service staff did it arrive at the table but too late - my coffee was cold. (no hot milk with coffee at this establishment).  Eventually all tables were given milk for their beverages! It was the same story for the toast - no butter.  Brown bread - eventually! The waiting staff are very slow to react and do not seem to be given any direction by a manager?",2,2015,08,10
119,Shame about the service!,"Arrived in the reception to a scene of total chaos. Staff did not seem to know what they were doing. Eventually managed to get checked in but when we asked if we could make a reservation in the restaurant that evening we were told they were fully booked and as it was the weekend we would have needed to book well in advance. If that was the case surely we should have been informed when the reservation was made. I have stayed in many hotels but have never been unable to eat in their restaurant

Our room was very nice and spacious with all the amenities that we expected the only problem we had was that the safe in the room did not work. We rang reception and they sent someone to look at it. After a short while of trying to fix the problem he said it was broken and he would need to replace it. Much to our surprise he just lifted the safe out of the cupboard and promptly took it away. It was not secured at all and if someone had got into the room they could have easily put it in a bag and just walked out the front door with it !!

After a walk around the area we decided to go to the bar and sit on the deck for a relaxing drink. We waited 15 mins to have our order taken then another 15 mins for the drinks to arrive. After finishing our drinks we then had to spend a further 20 mins trying to get a bill. We had planned to return to the bar  that evening for cocktails before going out to eat but after that experience decided against it. We did go back for a night cap later but the service was even slower.

Due to the terrible service we would not stay here again.",3,2015,08,10
119,Great night away,"Great stay. Absolutely great food and exceptional service.  The cocktails were good. Could have had a wider selection and all ingredients to make those in offer. 

Bar staff, waiters and all other staff were really helpful.  We were made to feel really special on our stay and nothing was too much trouble.  The set food menu and service was so good, it was worthy of 5 stars.

Have given it 4 stars as our bottles of water ordered through room service did not arrive.

Thank you Sunborn.",4,2015,08,10
119,Outstanding support to aid our Charity Event,"Many thanks to the Suborn team who worked tirelessly to create a unique event aboard the Sunborn for our colleague supplier and clients. Many of our invitees have already written to me to praise the food, location, effectiveness of the customer service and the special location we chose. The complimentary shoe shine and laundry service were a godsend.",5,2015,08,10
119,Disappointing,"When we first heard about this unusual hotel we thought we must try it. Booking in was easy and we were looking forward to the experience. Looking at other reviews the hotel experience was described as good but the food was letting the place down. Oh how true! We arrived late in the evening and went to the bar and ordered the charcuterie plate. There was far too much meat and the rolls were rock hard. We did complain and to be fair they didn't charge us for it. Anyway the room was brilliant and the view of Canary Wharf was fantastic. A real treat to sit and take in the scenery. The bed was exceptionally comfortable the room very spacious. The bathroom was somewhat disappointing as there was no bath. Perhaps the marine architect should have saved a bit of room on the sleeping area and increased that bathroom so to add a bath. Never mind it wasn't a deal breaker. We got to breakfast at 10:30 (that's the time they close!) we spoke with the receptionist on the entrance to the restaurant and she was somewhat abrupt about the time we arrived. My understanding is that the restaurant closes at 10:30 but you shouldn't be kicked out then. You should have say 20-25 minutes to finish off. The lady said she would have to speak to the chef, away she went returning she said she would have to speak with her supervisor. She rang but couldn't get in contact. So she decided to let us sit down but asked us not to take too long. Bearing in mind I had paid nearly £40 for two to have breakfast I was getting frustrated and said that we felt we were not being made to feel welcome. There were two other diners in and the food was all still in place (buffet) and to be told not to take too long was not acceptable. The final bill was £270 for B & B and some drinks the night before. In summary what could have been a real fun night was lost due to poor staff training. No rush to return.",3,2015,08,09
119,Absolutely appalling service - AVOID!,"A group of us visited the Sunborn last Friday evening for drinks.  Never again.  We waited about 15 minutes for someone to take our order and then another 15 minutes for the drinks to arrive! When they did arrive, the 2 champagne cocktails were undrinkable. The glasses were covered in sugar around the rim which you had to wipe off before you could even take a sip, they were missing ingredients and were made using flat champagne! One of them tasted like a flat Orange energy drink and the other was equally vile.  We then ordered wine as we thought this would be a safer option and that was another 15 minute wait! The servers also got the orders wrong and just seemed completely disinterested. When I complained about the cocktails being undrinkable I was told by the barman they weren't his creation! All in all a terrible experience and if I was the manager I would be embarrassed.  AVOID at all costs unless you want overpriced, awful drinks with TERRIBLE service.",1,2015,08,09
119,Gorgeous location but very disappointing experience,"The hotel itself is beautiful, but the service is slow and poor, staff aren't attentive, and the chef / kitchen dreadful. They served poached eggs after waiting 20 minutes that were undercooked to the point of inedible. Not able to cater for gluten free at all despite weeks notice. I pre ordered an afternoon tea last visit and got one sandwich and fruit. This time they had gluten free bread but no idea how to toast it. Even simple requests like ordering a taxi were hard work with conflicting advice from staff on where to wait - visit London a lot but won't be returning",2,2015,08,09
119,Amazing customer service!!!,"I surprised my husband for our anniversary with an overnight stay on this beautiful yacht hotel on Friday. Words cannot describe what a fantastic time we had. We were greeted at reception by the beaming smile of Nazma, what a lovely girl, she could not do enough for us. She was so helpful & when she realised it was our anniversary offered us a room upgrade. It truly made our stay so special & we really can't thank her enough. 

The hotel itself is spectacular, spotlessly clean & fantastic views from the deck leading off from the bar area. The room we had was so spacious & again spotless, we didn't have a river view but it didn't matter because you could just sit on the deck for the view. 

All of the staff were lovely from the moment we checked in & throughout our entire stay. I would definitely recommend Sunborn, especially if you fancy a hotel stay with a difference. You won't be disappointed.",5,2015,08,09
119,Poor relation of Sunborn Gibraltar,"If you come to Sunborn London expecting it to be of the same quality as Gibraltar (as we did), then you will be disappointed.
The hotel looks similar from the outside although much smaller than Gib, but the biggest let down is the bathrooms. When spending £200-£300 per night on a static hotel room, I do not expect to have a tiny bathroom the same as a cheap cabin on a cruise ship! I have no idea why the rooms in Gib have large marble bathrooms and London does not - I would assume the same designer was responsible for both yachts.
As for the rest of hotel, it is just OK, but nothing special. The receptionists were however exceptional - a real credit to the hotel.
In conclusion, I think there are better hotels for the price in London, so if you want to try a yacht hotel, try the one in Gib, which now it's fully finished with new restaurant and casino is a really great hotel.",3,2015,08,09
119,Simply luxurious experience  ,"We stayed for two nights and never wanted to leave! The yacht is pure luxury from start to finish. I had let the staff know this was a special Birthday visit and arranged for champagne etc in the room and this was in place and chilled when we arrived. There was also a welcome letter from the manager which was a lovely touch. We love molton brown products anyway so this was perfect for us. We had the river view executive room and it was really spacious and comfortable. The room was immaculate and was serviced to a high standard for our second night too. The staff were friendly and welcoming with nothing too much trouble. We didn't eat on board due to the reviews we read on the service but we had a drink in the bar a couple of times and that was a good experience with reasonably priced wine and complimentary mixed nuts. We received a 50% voucher off our first drink which again was a lovely touch. We loved the experience and cannot fault anything. I booked thinking this was a one off treat but I will definitely be going back to experience this again. There is a place to eat 3 minutes walk away called La Barrique and I would recommend that for food and it is open from morning until night. Don't hesitate to book this yacht experience, you won't be disappointed.  ",5,2015,08,08
119,Very Nice!,"We stayed as a family for just one night and had the executive rooms as we could have our youngest son with us on the sofa bed.  Staff were efficient, friendly and informative.  The position is fab if your going to excell, london City airport or need to be by DLR, it's about 35 mins from central london via either the emirates airline and then the tube or you can go on the DLR with one change I think. Rooms are large and cleaned beautifully with super beds, we had a little balcony which was nice.  The bathroom was good quality and still had the cruise ships original door which does close tight on its own so be careful with young children.  All in all a super idea in an area which is up and coming with numerous restaurants and bars so going with friends would also be a great idea as well as family.  Good value for money too!",4,2015,08,07
119,Fabulous,"Stated here for 1 night in June prior to seeing a fleetwood Mac at the O2 and I cannot fault it. Check in was smooth and we were served chilled water as it was roasting outside, our room had been upgraded free of charge due to it being a birthday celebration, the food at breakfast was delicious and the staff were lovely. 

Will def be back again",5,2015,08,07
119,"Fantastic, recommended ","Stayed here for my birthday and had a great time.
As it was my birthday, got a free upgrade, with a lovely hand written letter from the manager.
The room was lovely, the shower was great, bed comfy.
Will definitely go back.
Some of the feed back suggested the bar was slow, so we just went ashore and had a cracking time.
If you look hard enough there will always be something to gripe about.
But c'mon, for the money I paid for what I got, I walked away a very happy customer indeed and will definitely return and recommend it to people.
The majority of reviews are genuinely enthusing with positivity so give it a go!",5,2015,08,07
119,Outstanding,A very enjoyable stay for my Partners Birthday 20th to 22nd July. I don't normally do reviews but for this special Hotel I wanted to say it surpassed our expectations. Having stayed in many leading Hotels I usually find there is something lacking. But at Sunborn this was not the case .... And I am extremely picky!! It was a pleasure to meet Front of House Manager Apostolos but sad we only had time for a quick chat on check out. I was happy to pass on our compliments. It is apparent that the staff strive to meet the highest standards. We enjoyed our meals in the Restaurant so much that we didn't explore anywhere else. We are already planning another visit in November for my Daughter's Birthday. Thanks to everyone who made our stay so special.,5,2015,08,07
119,Perfect from start to finish,"From the moment you walk up, to when you leave, the staff make you feel welcome and the yacht feels like luxury. A massive thank you to all the staff for making me feel like I was on holiday, even though I only stayed for a night! The rooms are great and massive (I was upgraded free of charge!!) with a beautiful balcony overlooking the docks. Great for a romantic getaway, or to finish a shopping trip. Definitely recommended.",5,2015,08,05
119,A good experience but a word of caution...,"I booked this hotel for a surprise birthday treat for my partner's birthday and she was really taken aback when she realised where we were staying! Walking down to the dock from the DLR station, it slowly began to dawn on her where we were staying! Very unique hotel in a unique location and an experience she won't forget in a hurry. The staff all seemed pleasant enough and our room (with balcony and river view) was very nice. The bed was one of the most comfortable I have stayed in anywhere in the world and was very similar to the excellent quality beds you get in America. OK, so that's the good stuff. I read many other reviews before booking this and I have to say that the gripes other people had, we experienced too. This was mainly to do with the service in the bar. You are asked to take a seat and someone from the bar will come and serve you. That's all well and good IF they actually bother to come over! The first time we were served promptly, although it took a while to pay the bill. The second time we went there after dinner, I went to the bar and just wanted to buy two drinks, but they insisted we go sit down. I told them we wanted to sit out on the deck, which the bar man said was not a problem. We waited 10 minutes and still no one bothered to come and take our order. In the end we got fed up of waiting and decided to go and check out some of the good bars within the dock area. I'm not going to mention the incompetent waiting staff in the restaurant, as I'll review that separately, but they clearly have a problem getting experienced staff who know how to serve properly. I'm not saying they were all bad, but one or two ruined the experience and management needs to sort it out. The only other gripe we had was that despite suggesting this is a 5-star experience, the tea and coffee facilities in the room were poor. They did have a special coffee machine in the room but only provided 3 cups worth. They also didn't leave enough milk for more than a couple of cups. I don't understand these places that charge loads, have nice rooms, bathrobes even, and skimp on the tea and coffee! The bathroom was very nice, although they didn't provide any shower gel. Not sure if that was an oversight as we did have two shampoos, so you might want to bring your own just in case. Towels were lovely and big, although note there is no extractor fan in the bathrooms so they can get hot if the hairdryer is used or someone has a hot shower etc. I do get the feeling that the hotel rather relies on one-off visits for special occasions as they seem to rest on their laurels somewhat. The receptionist asked if we were here for a special reason and I told her it was my partner's birthday and she just said, oh we have lots of people stay here for their birthday. She gave us a 50% off your first drink voucher, but I have a feeling that she gives them to everyone who stays. It was a good experience but at those prices I'm not sure I'll be back.",4,2015,08,05
119,Anniversary trip away,"We stayed a night away in London here for our 25th wedding anniversary and it was from start to finish a wonderful experience.  All the Staff were polite and welcoming throughout our stay. We were upgraded to a beautiful room with water views and given cocktail vouchers for the bar. The room and bathroom were spotless and ready when we arrived early. A  hand written note from manager was in our room, welcoming us and congratulating us on our anniversary. 
A great location for the O2. We took the cable car over with fabulous views of the city.  Returned and sipped cocktails looking out over the city as the sun went down. 
Parked in excel car park next door with only 2 minute walk. Breakfast was relaxing and  lovely with views over the dock and again the staff attentive and friendly.
Would definitely stay again, a little gem! Thank you Sunborn.",5,2015,08,05
119,Fabulous,"A unique experience! Booked for my family to celebrate my birthday. A surprise upgrade to river side and a sweet birthday note from manager was much appreciated. Beautiful rooms, lounge bar, outside deck and view gorgeous. Breakfast was excellent and we were given a nice table by the window and staff wished me Happy Birthday! Never written a review before but had to for this.

Can't wait for an excuse to go back.",5,2015,08,04
119,Special & Unique Experience,"Very spacious and nicely furnished room, friendly and attentive staff who made us feel very welcome and nothing too much trouble. Great views (a luxury in the centre of London) and amazing breakfast. I booked it as a surprise for my husband and I had high expectations but I am glad to say both of us were not disappointed and would certainly stay again - in fact started planning the next trip already! Feel like I want to keep it all to ourselves but that wouldn't be fair on others would it! Only downside was it is a bit of a journey back in to very centre of London but well worth it.",5,2015,08,04
119,Perfect from start to finish,"I must admit this was a lovely hotel and although my expectations were very high - I was not left disappointed. From the moment we checked in, Nazma (who I must say was possibly one of the friendliest and most genuine people we have come across on a hotel reception before) made us feel welcome and made check-in a breeze. She was very knowledgeable of the hotels and the brand and couldn't do enough to make our stay a special one. The hotel itself felt intimate yet we were told it was full as there was a wedding on, but there was never a feeling of being over-crowded and similarly there were never times where we thought we were the only ones there - the atmosphere was just right. 

On to the bar.. We both had a cocktail or two which were expertly shaken and stirred by bar-staff not only knew what they were doing, but were passionate about what they do. 

We didn't eat in the restaurant as we had reservations elsewhere, so can only comment on the room-service which was OK for the time of night (we had pizza) but I don't think I would have it again - yet it wasn't so poor that I felt the need to complain - and we did eat it all!

The room we stayed in was lovely with a nice balcony, amenities were great and there was a lot of space so couldn't fault them

I would have probably expected a gym of sorts (but that's just me) however there was a spa which we heard was fantastic (although we didnt get time to use that either)

All in all a perfect stay and we have already raved about it to friends and family and would definitely stay again!",5,2015,08,03
119,Stay here!!!,"Wow, wow, wow! I could end the review there but I'm guessing you want a little more info. My daughter and I went to London for a couple of nights and spent our first night here...we were tempted to refuse to leave as we both fell in love with this hotel. The yacht looks amazing from the outside but then you get inside and you are blown away. The reception is beautiful and the staff so welcoming, everything is so secure as you can only get to the reception unless you have a room key to activate the lift to the other floors, plus the internal doors are room key activated. Every member of staff we met greeted us warmly and made sure we knew where we were going. Then we went to our room and were blown away. It was huge! We had a big bed, a couch, a coffee table, free coffee maker and a lovely bathroom. Just when I thought things couldn't get any better I discovered the Molton Brown toiletries. The views are fabulous, especially in the evening, the bar is a great place to go for a cocktail...not cheap but delicious and the breakfast was lovely. Just over the road is a pub where you can get delicious food for a reasonable price, plus there are lots of other bars and cafes and a Tesco Express, all just a short walk away. The cable cars are also within walking distance and after checking out we went on them and then got the Thames Clipper back into the centre. I suppose the only negative is that it's about half an hour travelling from the centre via the tube then the DLR, but to be honest this hasn't put me off and I quite enjoyed the journey. It's nice to escape from the hustle and bustle of the centre. If you're looking for somewhere to stay near the O2 then this is the perfect place...in fact forget that, if you're visiting London, this is the perfect place! I love this hotel and can't wait to return.",5,2015,08,03
119,Birthday ,"A fabulous experience, beautiful hotel, yummy food and wonderful staff made for a thoroughly enjoyable stay. Love the cocktail menu too! Such a different experience we would definitely recommend to others and would love to return one day

119,Mrs J Davy,"The welcome we received at the Sunborn Yacht Hotel in London was wonderful, we were met by a young lady called Nazma who helped us and looked after us through out our stay. It was so lovely to meet a genuinely kind helpful and happy person like Nazma, 5* hotel with 5* staff. The food in he restaurant was very good quality. Many thanks for a great weekend.",5,2015,08,02
119,Relaxing view.,"It didn't start well when the receptionist had to call someone over to translate for her - and I'm a Londoner! When ordering lunch we had to show the waiter the menu as he also couldn't understand us. We asked for brown bread and was met with a stare and 'no, we don't have that'! With a bit of persuading, surprise, surprise, it turns out they do have brown bread! We had a riverside yacht executive room which had a balcony with chairs. Lovely room, faultless. The boat is actually moored in a dock, not on the river Thames so passing traffic was canoeists and paddleboarders. Very quiet. Breakfast excellent value at £12.50. Dinner overpriced but my duck comfit was the best I'd ever had (although it was served without any veg at all, literally just the duck with a couple of chef puree squiggles.) Also, they had run out of all ice cream- how is that possible with such a basic item?!! Its an ideal place to stay if you're going to the O2 as you can use the cable car to cross over the river. Its out of town and theres not much around it but its a good base with the DLR near by. Would stay again but would eat out.",4,2015,08,01
119,London Show Trip,"This was the most fabulous hotel I have ever stayed at, staff very friendly and polite and helpful, would definitely recommend this hotel and I would in deed stay here again on my trip to London.  Cable car plus boat trip places to eat on the docks, not far to city centre by car or public transport.",5,2015,08,01
119,wonderful,"Spent only one night here on thursday and absolutely loved it.
We arrived at 8.p.m. and wished we could have arrived much earlier.
The boat is stunning and we were able to upgrade (at a cost) to a balcony room. the room was spotlessly clean and very spacious. We went down to the bar and enjoyed a cocktail whilst relaxing and looking over the water to the millenium dome and cable car.
we did not have breakfast in the morning as I felt £19.50 charge to be over the top.
It is only £12.50 at the weekends.Why???
I was told that it is because it is used by business people in the week, so as a casual user we are penalised as well.
That aside, we had a lovely time. The staff are gentle and kind and very helpful.
We will definitely go back, but unless they are more reasonable on their food pricing will probably not eat there.
many thanks for a relaxing stay.",5,2015,07,31
119,"Pants in bed , otherwise fab hotel","Such a fabulous place to stay. However could not believe to my shock and horror someone's underpants in our bed. They moved us to another room thank god. The safe was broken and the took ages to fix.
The gave us free breakfasts which were very nice and £90 off our accommodation which made up for the bad experience.
I still think it was a great place to stay tough and would stay there again but will check for pants.",4,2015,07,31
119,Visiting London,"I travelled to London by coach.  It takes a bit of time, depending where you're travelling from.  The yacht is London's newest hotel, &truly a sumptuous & luxurious place to stay.  Rooms are between 19 & 23 square metres, so you are not going to be cramped.  About an hour out of central London, but lots of buses around to get you there.  Plenty of eating places & shopping in the dockland area & a very good restaurant too.  Also had a tablet in every room.  Very handy.",5,2015,07,31
119,Great place,"I loved staying there its a yacht at the excel in London 
It's different from the usual hotel and the service is excellent from all the staff I encountered. 
Definitely stay again 
The room I had was pretty large with a lounge area and large port hole. 
",4,2015,07,31
119,Amazing!,"We stayed at the Sunbourn London in April. What a fantastic stay! We were there for mine and my partners birthday and it had been booked for us as a present.  Upon arrival, we received the BEST upgrade from the hotel to their best room! It was incredible, I have never stayed anywhere like it.  The staff were fantastic, very friendly and the food delicious.  Overall a fabulous hotel and would definitely recommend!  Thank you to the manager and all of the staff.",5,2015,07,30
119,anniversary treat.,"Spent the night of our wedding anniversary here and found spending time on the yacht hotel to be a very special experience. The place was spotlessly clean and extremely well presented. We dined in the restaurant. The food was lovely and the staff could not have been more helpful. 

The view from the restaurant into Canary Warf at night is well worth a look.

Two negative things : The service in the bar on the Saturday afternoon was so slow that we decided not to go in there for dinner that night was that. As it turned out dining in the restaurant was definitely a good move.
Only bad thing about the room was the hairdryer in the bathroom didn't work.",5,2015,07,30
119,Great for a very different break,"We went to the Sunborn for my birthday treat to my husband as he is fanatical on boats. We arrived and lucky for us (matter of opinion) I have a Disabled Blue Badge for parking, enabling us to park at the front of the hotel.  Everyone else has to park in the nearest car park and walk to the hotel - not so nice in the rain or snow!!!!  The Reception area when you arrive is beautiful, the staff are helpful (or at least some of them are!).  We sat on the back deck in the glorious sunshine and had lunch (quite pricey), there are only a few tables available and we were lucky with the weather.  If no tables are available the only other place to sit is in the bar inside.  When our cabin was ready after 3pm we went there.  The room/cabin is spacious, well equipped and tastefully decorated.  The bathroom is also very nice and functional.  Molton Brown toiletries are very lovely.  We had dinner on the boat in the lovely restaurant, we had the set menu at £30.50 per head plus drinks as the a la carte is quite pricey also, the food was excellent and service good.  There is nothing to do on the boat/hotel at all other than sit in the bar.  After dinner we went back to our room and watched TV.  The bed is very comfortable and in the morning we did not have breakfast on board as it is not included and we had other things to do.  I would recommend this hotel for a one night break and not for families with children necessarily.",3,2015,07,29
119,All I can say is Wow!,"I didn't know what to expect when we travelled to the Sunborn.  I knew it was a Yacht, that was now a hotel and that was it.  When we arrived and looked at it from the Quayside it was enormous!  We stepped inside the lift to Reception on the 3rd floor, the doors opened for us to be greated by the most beautful Chandelier with a very grand double staircase up to the restaurant on the deck above. 
Nazmar on Reception was very helpful and friendly.  We were in cabin 3039, we walked along the lush carpeted wide corridor to our cabin which was situated toward the front of the Yacht.  It  was very nicely decorated.  There was a small fridge with complimentary bottles of water.  The usual tea and coffee making facilities, tv.  phone and also a safe!  What made me very happy was when I realised that there was a balcony as well.  It was great, although we were dockside we could stand on the balcony and just enjoy lookng 'over the side'!!
We stayed for 3 nights.  Our room was kept clean and it was quiet - nicely looked after by the housekeeping team.
My daughter and son in law had booked a room two floors below us, they had a large oval porthole, and they had a lovely view over the water - it was great.
We had a wonderful time and I would certainly recommend the Sunborn and we will be staying there when we go to the Excel again.",5,2015,07,28
119,Great for a special night out,"I took my 11 year old son here as a special treat to end a trip to London. We had a great time. We booked the morning of our trip and got a reduced rate on booking.com. Staff on reception both on check in and out were very friendly, polite and efficient., as were all the other staff we encountered. They went out of our way to show us stuff on the boat and to talk to us. The boat looks amazing when you arrive and especially at dusk when it lights up. The room was spacious and bed really comfortable and showers warm, powerful and clean. We didn't have a room with a balcony as couldn't afford the extra £50 but we enjoyed the river view from the porthole. I would recommend a river view over a land view. The bar staff were a bit slow but we were enjoying the view and watching the cable cars and planes so were not bothered. Breakfast was good but I thought £20 a little expensive. We only had it as children ate for free. We thoroughly enjoyed our stay and would jump at the chance to go again. Not sure about parking but it would be helpful to know where there is some, as we purposely left our car out of town and caught public transport. The DLR and Emirates Air Line are really close for transport. Also has free wifi and tablet. I also recommend the hot chocolate. Never had one delivered like this before.",5,2015,07,28
119,A Wonderful Hotel,"Our first stay at the Sunborn London, but not our last.   We were warmly welcomed by Maryiam,a receptionist in a million!   We stayed for 3 nights and Maryiam always remembered our names and made us feel welcome and at home.   The rooms were beautifully appointed, clean and spacious.   The view from the restaurant was so interesting and the food and service so good that we ate there every night.   The location was perfect for our needs and access to the DLR is so easy.",5,2015,07,28
119,Lovely place to stay,"We stayed at this hotel for a night after seeing it advertised on hotel tonight. We thought why not stay on a boat for the night. 

We arrived and got the key for our room, we were not disappointed. The room was lovely and had a coffee machine in as well as a tablet to surf the web or have a browse at their spa treatments and food. The bathroom had heated flooring and we had our own private balcony. 

After showering and getting dressed we decided to go and check out the rest of the boat. We went down to their bar and ordered some drinks and sat outside. It was pretty windy but we managed to hang in there. There was a lovely view from outside and soft music playing. After finishing our drinks we made a decision to get room service rather than dine in their restaurant. 

We checked the menu on the tablet but there was not a lot of choice so we decided to call. We ordered chicken korma a few beers and some dessert. I asked for no raisons in mine and was told this is fine. Our food arrived but unfortunately our drinks and the naan bread to go with the korma was forgotten. We called down and they advised they would bring this up. We got a phone call a few minutes later and was advised there was no naan bread but they could offer us rolls. I think it may have been useful to advise this at the time of us ordering not when we have our food sitting in front of us! 

We ended up receiving the rolls when we had finished the food so that was a shame. I finally came to eat my dessert and low and behold it had raisins in. I still ate it but would have preferred it without.

Overall a really good stay, the only down side was the food but next time we may just eat in the restaurant. Would definitely come back and stay again as it is a beautiful place. ",4,2015,07,28
119,rExcellent,"second time stayed here this year staff very friendly ,rooms are clean and lots of room will book again when staying in London . Great place to stay if you are going to see some think at the O2 and right next to the hotel is the emirates cable car.",5,2015,07,27
119,Exceptional quality and a refreshing change of London Hotel,"We stayed for one night on board the exceptionally beautifully furnished boat. Our cabin was excellent value, extremely spacious, clean and airy with a balcony and view.Staff were superb and attentive and obviously very well trained. Having arrived to beautiful weather we enjoyed lunch out on the deck and enjoyed the view across the river to the 02. The hotel was ideally placed for us as we did not want or need to be in the centre of London as we were attending a concert in Greenwich and dinner beforehand at the Greenwich Naval Hall. It is ideally situated for anyone wanting to visit the EdExcel centre, Canary Wharf, London City Airport, Greenwich Maritime or Cutti Sark as the boat is situated at the Customs House stop of the DLR network. Probably not a suitable venue for young children but ideal for all adults ( lift to all floors) and couples.",5,2015,07,27
119,Wonderful birthday treat,Stayed on the Sunborn London on the 17th July in an executive river side room. It was a wonderful experience the staff were so friendly and efficient. Lovely 3 course dinner in the restaurant and breakfast was superb. Had cocktails on the sun deck and enjoyed the view looking over towards Canary Wharf and watching the planes as they took off from City Airport - look forward to going again  ,5,2015,07,27
119,Amazing staff and correct prices,"I book the room for my boyfirend birthdaya dn we had a warm welcome from all the staff.

The romantic package was just perfect and they managed to makes us having a relaxing and cheerful moment.

I warmly recommend this hotel.",5,2015,07,27
119,"Beautiful yacht, wonderful stay, wonderful staff","Arrived Thursday pm to such a warm friendly welcome. from the bellboy to the reception staff everyone was warm and friendly and went out of their way to make us feel welcomed. We ate in the restaurant  only one night, however the food was excellent!
The beds were huge and very comfortable which is a definate requirement for my husband and myself as we both suffer from bad backs. We look forward to staying again! May we say a special thanks to Nazma on front office for her outstanding friendliness and officiancy along with the rest of her team.",5,2015,07,27
119,A Special and Unique Stay in London,"As a treat for my boyfriend and I's anniversary we stayed a night on the Sunborn London. We both absolutely loved our stay - despite only living 10 minutes away in Canary Wharf, we felt as if we were on holiday on a luxury yacht in the Med! Our executive room with a river view was lovely; it felt cosy and homely despite it being a very generously sized room with a large balcony. All the little touches, which I love about luxury hotels, like the supply of bath robes, slippers and tea and coffee making facilities all added to the experience. 
One of the highlights of the yacht was the bar area - sitting outside on the deck with a cocktail in hand with views of Canary Wharf and the City was great; despite seeing this view everyday, I still felt like I was on holiday! We also had dinner in the restaurant which was very good - all the food was of a very high quality and the presentation was excellent. I have no complaints about the service - all the bar staff and restaurant staff were very attentive and friendly. 
The wood furnishings throughout the Sunborn reminded us that we were staying on a yacht rather than just in another hotel which is what made this stay so special and unique. I think it's important to note that you feel no movement whatsoever whilst on the yacht - something I was worried about as I suffer from motion sickness! Location wise, I would definitely recommend the Sunborn as a base for tourists - it's a welcome retreat in comparison to the hustle and bustle of Central London! Being so close to the DLR and the Emirates Cable Car also means you are in easy reach to all the action. 
There's something very peaceful about staying on the water - it was so quiet and serene - something us Londoners don't experience much in our own city! My boyfriend and I loved our stay at the Sunborn London - it was a special treat for us, something we would highly recommend to others and wish to repeat for ourselves!",5,2015,07,27
119,50th Birthday Meal,"I booked a set menu meal on the Sunborn for my parents 50th birthdays and was astounded at the quality of the food, the incredible staff and wonderful atmosphere in the restaurant. The staff make you feel as though you are their top priority and my parents were made to feel so special on their big day- I can't thank the team enough for that. 
Being a set menu, I was afraid that the food would not be substantial, but I couldn't have been more wrong. It was the nicest meal I've ever had and the quality was out of this world. 
My only slight criticism about the day was when we retired to the bar downstairs. The staff were not as friendly as the restaurant staff and made various mistakes with our order but I would never let that taint the review of the restaurant as they thoroughly deserve all 5 stars!! 
Thank you, Rebecca!",5,2015,07,27
119,Sunborntastic,"My husband's 50th Birthday surprise treat did not disappoint.
This hotel feels like a hidden gem.
The reception staff were friendly and welcoming - the bar staff needed a lead and a smile but this did not detract from our stay or 'chilling' until last orders...
Our room was AMAZING - with a view and a deck that was missing our own party - given it was just us two!
It made our weekend so special and memorable and I would recommend it to anyone.
Thank you Sunborn, Leanne.",5,2015,07,26
119,Family visit staying sunborn yacht hotel London ,"Fantastic night away.  Staff were very friendly. Room was amazing.  Nothing was to much trouble. They made us all feel special.  Made lots of fuss of the boys. Lovely gift for boys to play with. 
Lovely welcome gift of chocolate in the rooms.  
Beautiful view from balcony. 
Amazing coffee in the room. 
Thank you to lovely receptionist Maryian nothing seemed to much trouble.  Would highly recommend it and will.definitely be making a return trip.  Thank you.",5,2015,07,25
119,A very enjoyable stay on The Sunborn,"Stayed on this very beautiful yacht for a couple of days this week. Very beautiful decor, exceptional cleanliness, staff very friendly nothing too much trouble, all in all a very enjoyable stay, one criticism sorry was the price of the breakfast, quite expensive in my opinion.but i would highly recommend this beautiful yacht for a very different type of stay in London.",5,2015,07,25
119,Very nice alternative!,"Had a great night at this hotel recently. Staff are very friendly, place is ultra clean and comfortable, my room was surprisingly big - i thought - for a Yaught. Food and drink excellent. Great for a night over before or after an event at excel London, which is right on the doorstep.",5,2015,07,24
119,Wonderful,"My husband & I were celebrating our 20th wedding anniversary and wanted to go somewhere a little different without the children. This seemed a good choice. Upon arrival we were advised our room wasn't yet ready but we had been given a free upgrade. We had lunch in the hotel restaurant which was delicious and I thought very good value for £18 for two courses & a glass of champagne.  When we returned to the reception we were congratulated on our wedding anniversary and escorted to our upgraded room. We had been allocated the best room on the yacht, the riverside suite. And it was out of this world! Absolutely stunning interlocking rooms with a jacuzzi bath, double shower & even our own sauna! A huge private deck with enough room to have a party! Cannot put into words how amazing it was that we were there. The staff were all exceptional, from reception to the restaurant to the chambermaids. All were very polite and friendly and most wished us a happy anniversary which made us feel very special.  The one downside was the cost of the breakfast, but we decided we wanted to eat there just to finish off the experience of a lifetime for us. Would highly recommend this yacht as something special and we can't wait to go back for our 25th wedding anniversary :-)",5,2015,07,24
119,good and bad,"This was my birthday treat for 15 family and friends ,dinner was for the 15 of us 9 of us were staying in a total of 5 riverside rooms,check in was fairly smooth I did ask for someone to show an elderly friend where there room was just handing us all cards and letting us fend for ourselves no pointing us in the right direction was not the best of starts.
We then headed to the bar  where the fun began we had to go and asked to be served and then waited over 45 minutes repeatedly asking for our drinks ,this set the scene for the rest of the night we had to order double rounds, double bottles of champagne all night I did speak to the duty manager next morning about this but on reading here this has been going on for some time and nothing seems to be getting done at one stage in the restaurant when I tried to order a round of drinks they had to get someone else because they couldn't understand what we were trying to order one of my party even had to leave the table go down stairs to the bar and point out what he he wanted kent accents are not that difficult .we are all still waiting on our deserts they never materialised , we asked  repeatedly for biscuits and cheese to the point gave up after only some came ,they also had difficulty coping with a full yacht at breakfast all these I discussed with management ,also a charge on my card which they said had not been taken which had but yes they are refunding
I did not expect anything from them for my 60th but a happy birthday from one person or hope you enjoyed your stay would have been nice but nothing.
Yes,  it has the wow factor ,yes it is spotless, yes the food we did get was lovely yes when everything is sorted it will be fantastic but until then it needs working on",4,2015,07,22
119,Lovely Hotel,"Stayed for seven nights on the Sunborn. My husband and I booked online and did not know what to expect. We were surprised. Best hotel in London, England. Large room with king bed. Very clean room and yacht. Would give 5 stars. Couldnt beat location as it was steps from transit. Easy access to all main attractions using the DLR. Would stay here again. ",5,2015,07,21
119,Birthday celebration.,"Really lovely place to stay. Very different out of the busy city. Spotless clean and staff always friendly always greeted us and they was very helpful with directions out and about and into the city. Easy access to the tube to London too. 
Shame my birthday went unnoticed as we did point it out when booking. and that was the reason for our stay on the yacht celebrating. Any little touched Would have been nice. But nether less I Would recommend anyone to try sunborn.",4,2015,07,21
119,London 2015 ,"Stayed two nights here for a family break with my father as we were going to the O2 to see Bette Midler,it is a fabulous hotel & very handy to get to an fro city centre via Dlr & the underground, rooms are clean an luxurious, your feet just sink into the plush carpets and the washroom facilities are very spacious  and tidy,  and staff are  extremely  friendly and help full,  the food is devine an the 24hour room service is very quick the room has a tablet to place your order direct with reception so no phone calls to be made to use this service,  I will definitely  be visiting again an most definitely  recommend  this hotel to family and friends.",4,2015,07,20
119,"Great spot, decent hotel.","Just got back from spending a couple of nights here and my partner and I were both very pleased with Sunborn.

We arrived early on check-in day with the intention of dropping our bags off - there's no parking particularly close to the hotel - but were pleased to find we were able to check in, which was nice. The room met my very picky partner's cleanliness standards and was spacious by London standards; comfortable and well equipped too. Location-wise, the hotel is a few minutes walk to the Emirates cable car for easy access to the O2 and closer yet to the DLR for access to the rest of the city.

We used the bar once in the evening - fine but service a bit on the slow side - and had breakfast once (we decided that the good selection of eateries nearby would beat the £20/head weekday breakfast rate but the weekend rate of £12.50 was reasonable) but otherwise we only used our room so can't comment on any other of the services offered here.

If I had to be picky, the one down side in the room was an odd clanging noise from outside which was constant although masked sufficiently by the air conditioning unit that it didn't keep us awake. I have no idea what it was; the sound was like a loose rope blowing against a mast on a sailing boat but I can't imagine there were any masts near us!",4,2015,07,20
119,Mixed feelings....,"I have just returned from a weekend trip in London and an overnight stay at the Sunborn - which I bought as a Birthday present for my partner.

Check in was smooth and the receptionist was very helpful, but I was very disappointed to find that we were unable to get a table for dinner until 10 pm! If you want to eat at a reasonable time I suggest you pre book before you arrive. 
We were early and our room was not ready, so we just left our bags and went exploring. We had a short walk to the cable cars over to the O2 then on the underground to central London.

On our return our allocated room was very nice and comfortable, we had a waterside view as requested. All the facilities were good.

We head to the bar for cocktails and to wait for our table.
The view was lovely and the music pleasant so we were very happy at this stage however..... I have never known such poor service!
We waited ages before someone nearby finally caught the attention of a waiter on our behalf. The lounge did not appear to be very busy, so I felt very neglected and concerned about the evening ahead. We were then asked to sign for our drinks long before we received them, which I felt was unprofessional and annoying in the circumstances. I was beginning to feel it was the worst money I had ever spent and apologised to my partner about his present. We decided to go up to the restaurant at 9.45 and try our luck there and were so glad we did.
We were taken to a table with views across the water of floodlit O2 and Canary Wharf and I began to feel a happier.
Our waiter Peter was very attentive and the food and wine (even though I thought I would be past eating at that hour) was excellent, we really enjoyed our meal. Our compliments to the chef and all the restaurant staff.
I went to bed whilst I was winning, my partner returned to the bar for a nightcap, which he says went better as he plonked himself down on the only bar-stool and could not be missed!
Breakfast was busy and nothing out of the ordinary. Check out was busy and there was quite a queue.
All in all a nice weekend with its ups and downs. We would probably not stay again as I considered it expensive for what we had, but I would happily return to the restaurant and recommend it to a friend.",4,2015,07,20
119,Slightly Disappointed,"The venue is amazing 5 Star however the service didn't live up. The mini bar was empty minimal amount of brew kit. Dirty carpet in room and holes in the net curtains that could do with a clean. They take a £40 deposit on top of your room cost, who knows why? When you leave you get it straight back if you've paid by credit card or like me you have to wait 4 working days for your money back if you pay by debit card :-/. Now let's talk about breakfast , initial impressions were good however things went rapidly down hill,
1. Not enough bowls and plates 
2, Had to ask 5 yes five times for tea and coffee
3. Poached eggs delivered had to wait a further 10 mins for bacon and sausage to accompany my by now cold eggs. 
4. Eventually got coffee without the tea then lost plot and demanded a pot of tea then got two LOL
5. Finally asked for some more butter the waiter turned round to the table next door that had just been vacated and offered me their left overs OMG 
If your looking at this venue you will aleady be aware it's not cheap so to that end it should be of a standard # disappointed . !!!!!!",3,2015,07,19
119,Wow! What luxury.,"We booked an executive room, river view as part of our 15th wedding anniversary celebrations.  We arrived to find we had been upgraded to the best room on the yacht - an executive suite.  Wow, wow, wow, it was beyond anything we could have organised ourselves, and was pure luxury, the jacuzzi, sauna, his and her showers, the masses of space we had, not to mention the huge sun deck overlooking the Thames with views of Canary Wharf, The O2 and London City Airport.  Amazing! The yacht itself was beautifully decorated and the staff very helpful - the cocktails were nice too.  Thank you Sunborn, you made our stay very very special.",5,2015,07,19
119,Excellent hotel but with a few small but irritating issues.,"This was an excellent hotel with great ambiance. You definitely felt like you were on a cruise ship with an abundance of brass, glass and wood finish. We chose it as it was near the 02 for a concert. We had a 5 minute walk to the Emirates cable car which took us straight to the 02 site. As the Emirates flight closed at 10pm we had to come back via the tube and DLR which took a little longer but very easy. The attraction of the hotel was that it felt like a cruise ship. We sat out on the sun terrace at the stern which was very pleasant with a view of the 02 and the Emirates cable car across the dock. The bedroom was larger than most hotel rooms. The bed was very comfortable as it had a 'topper' over the mattress. We had breakfast on the Saturday morning which was very good. Planes would fly in and out of nearby London City airport over our heads which was interesting. However noise was not a problem because of good double glazing. The staff in all areas were very pleasant and courteous.
Now for the niggles. Both check in and check out had long waits. Only two of the four computer stations were occupied at check-in. All were used at check-out but the queue was longer.
The other area of problem was the bar. Although the staff were lovely, with a good attitude, they were not at all attentive. We had to ask for the drinks menu then attract someone to serve us as they just walked past oblivious to our and other customer needs. They also got simple drinks orders wrong and when we got one bill they missed off a round of coffees and another bill they did not know what we had to drink until I told them. Even then they charged us wrongly and had to change the bill. 
If we were not honest they would have lost money. I think closer management would solve this problem.
Would I stay again? Most definitely. Both my wife and I loved the hotel. A little attention to customer service would have given us a five star experience.",4,2015,07,19
119,Surprise stay,"this was a one night surprise trip on board Sunborn.  I was told (by hubby) it was a Hilton, but when we walkedalong the quay towards Sunborn, I didn't believe him!!  Once on board and in our room, facing towards the flats.  Well what could I say.  the cabin is larger than any hotel room, bed was lovley and comfy and to have a seating area - even better.  the fact it also had a coffee machine made it better.  We didn't stay for dinner, as we had a booking elsehwere,  but breakfast the following morning was plentiful.  Helpful staff and clean on board, made this a lovely surprise trip for me.  would recommend to any one, which I have to work colleauges.",5,2015,07,19
119,Could be worthy of its status.,"We are still on the yacht as I write this review. As always, there are good,very good and not so good points. 
The food my wife and I ate ( bar snack, dinner and breakfast ) were all to a high standard and worthy of the star rating. 
The room was a good size ( very big for a yacht ) with good furnishings. It wasn't cleaned to the highest standard but wasn't dirty either. 
The service at breakfast and dinner was to a high standard and I was impressed. 
One of the things that let the yacht down was the service at the bar and outside deck. The staffing levels were not enough to cope with a full hotel as well as additional people watching a swimming event next to the yacht ( which the management would have been aware of before setting the staffing levels for the day ). Also, a large part of the outside decking/bar area had been reserved by an event organiser ( according to a staff member ). So instead of opening the large deck above, we were having to stay away from the fresh air. It was even more frustrating as no one was to be seen there in the reserved area after 1.30 but it remained roped off. 
Prior to our visit, approximately two weeks before, I called to ask if my wife could eat from the bar menu in the restaurant in the evening as the menu was restrictive for her. I was assured it would be ok. On the evening it was made clear that it is not the norm but an exception would be made. The onversations left my wife feeling uncomfortable - Perhaps a little training is needed for whoever I spoke to on the phone. On checking out, I wasn't once asked about my our stay. Only a small thing but makes the difference and that would have been the ideal time to provide some feedback.
Overall we enjoyed our stay. If the management could sort out the small service issues we would be happy to return. It isn't a cheap stay and service should consistently meet the grade to warrant the charge.",3,2015,07,19
119,Loved our 24 hour stay,"Stayed June 11th for 1 night as off to O2 for Take That concert. We arrived and enjoyed a lovely lunch with glass of fizz, then we had prebooked massages in the spa - we were running late due to traffic so called to see if they could move our treatment times which they did. Spa treatments is tiny but enjoyed the Elemis massage. We enjoyed cocktails in the bar early evening, it was really busy but nice atmosphere. We caught the cable car over to arena which was really easy. 
Our room was perfect, clean, big, quiet and comfortable. Staff were friendly. Loved it! Thank you and we will be back next year for another break. ",5,2015,07,18
119,Fantastic experience,"Stayed at this floating yacht/hotel as a birthday surprise from my wife, our room was excellent and very comfortable, the room we had was a executive kingsize with a riverview and balcony which was slightly more expensive but totally worth the extra money in our opinion.We had a drink in the bar before going out for something to eat but was slightly disappointed with the seating in the bar lounge where the lounge does not seem big enough for the yacht/hotel and if the room occupancy is high as it was when we were there it was hard to find a seat, this is not a problem if the weather is nice as you can sit outside,that was the only downside to this fantastic place.We paid the extra for the breakfast in the morning and must admit although it was more than we would normally pay it was one of the best breakfast's that we have had at a hotel and you could if you were still hungry return for numerous helpings if you was that why inclined, the breakfast selection was excellent as well,we now wished that we had booked for dinner,maybe next time.
Overall a great stay and we would definitely stay here again.",5,2015,07,18
119,Could not fault it.,"What a fabulous stay we had. The room was spacious and very clean . The two nights we stayed we slept very well. The service we received from front desk , bar staff and restraunt was first class. We did not have to wait long for any thing we asked for. I think housekeeping needs a mention for keeping this yacht so clean. I would like to say thank you to the chef for making me a special chicken dish when we eat in the restraunt. We only left today 18th July but so wanted to stay longer. We cannot wait to come back. We had lovely weather and enjoyed walking around the docks.",5,2015,07,18
119,Good stay,"Stayed for a birthday celebration and concert at O2.  Staff very friendly.  I had booked a river view room and emailed the hotel twice asking about parking and mentioned the trip was a birthday surprise, but didn't get a reply.  I mentioned this at check in and received an apology and a complimentary upgrade to a balcony room. My partner's birthday was not acknowledged though and perhaps a complimentary drink would have been nice. Room was nice with a good view.  Seemed silly that they only supplied 2 teabags in each room.  We asked for more and even then only received 2 extra.  For a hotel of this quality I was surprised the mini bar was empty.   We were given a half price drink voucher for the bar which we used after our trip to the O2.  Bar was busy and service rather slow, but friendly. Didn't have breakfast, thought £19.50 per person quite steep even for London, but lots of places to eat nearby. Overall a good choice if you're looking for something a bit different and I would stay again.",5,2015,07,18
119,amazing break in luxury,"My husband booked this hotel as a surprise for a long wknd for my birthday. We got upgraded to a balcony room. The room was very spacious and bright. There is an ipad in the room for you to order room service or anything you might need. You can also use this to browse the internet free of charge. The toiletries were Molten Brown and lovely fluffy towels. The bed was very large and the one of the walls of the room was a mirror making the room feel even bigger. The bathroom was not very big but adequate with a lovely walk in shower. Plenty of hangers and wardrobe space and a safe. 
The bar area was very nice with an outside on deck to sit in the sunshine. We booked the restaurant for one of the evenings. The food was nice but nothing special and quite expensive. We also ate breakfast one of the mornings which is buffet service for everything except tea and coffee. We thought the hot breakfast would have been cooked to order especially the price they charge. We thought £19.50 each was very expensive. Also beware they charge a service charge for everything even if you go to the bar yourself. We asked them to remove all the service charges at the time they presented us with each bill. This was done with no problem. They soon add up !!  It was 5 minutes walk to the Emirates Cable Car which takes you direct to the 02 arena which was great for us as we were going to see a show there. On the way to the Cable car you pass several restaurants. We ate breakfast at one of these the other morning and only paid £5 each for a cooked breakfast and tea. 
However we enjoyed our stay and would go back again. The reception staff were really nice and knew us by name ever time we passed them.",5,2015,07,18
119,"""I'm on a boat!""","Overall a fantastic experience. Highly professional staff, great clean room, very comfortable. Only slight niggle was a small problem connecting to the internet. Highly recommended especially if going to an event at the Excel centre nearby.",5,2015,07,18
119,First class experience,"The cabin was divine. Lounge with dining area, perfect bedroom, luxurious bathroom/wet room with sauna and jacuzzi and an enormous balcony. The staff in Reception were friendly and professional in equal measure. Had a cocktail in the bar but did not take any meals. Perfect place to spend our wedding anniversary.",5,2015,07,18
119,A floating Hotel experience,"We came with a coach party and stayed for the one night. The Yacht is amazing.
Approaching the yacht from the Dockside is awesome. The room we stayed in was extremely well fitted out and was very comfortable.A good security measure was that you needed your pass key to access all areas. We had breakfast on board and the tables were laid out nicely. There was a good variety of choices of food and being a buffet you could have as much as you wanted. The staff were very attentive and wanted to please.
We were impressed and would return if we could afford it.",5,2015,07,17
119,Totally Cool Hotel,My friend and I stayed here one night because of the proximity to London City Airport. What a great find. We had rooms on the top floor overlooking the River. The rooms are like the best Cruise Ship I have ever been one. The wood is fantastic. We were greeted by lovely people and sat at the Bar and had a great lunch as well. I enjoyed walking around the area in the Morning as well. I highly recommend you give it a try!,5,2015,07,17
119,Luxurious stay Friday 10th July ,"From start to finish this was a luxurious stay. Staff on reception were friendly and welcoming. The rooms were available as soon as we arrived. The executive river view room was outstanding the bed was very comfortable, soft towels in the  bathroom. Lovely touches with the toiletries and robes/slippers. We booked into the restaurant for the 3 course meal which was all delicious again excellent service. Also booked into he restaurant for breakfast which again we were very impressed. Would definitely book the Sunborn hotel again ideal location to visit London just far enough out of the hustle and bustle of central London. ",5,2015,07,15
119,"Unique, relaxing, excellent! ","Stayed for one night before an event at the O2. Staff were very friendly with nothing being too much trouble. 

The Executive Suite was incredible! Had our own deck, sauna, jacuzzi bath and living area with full dining table. Spotlessly clean with great facilities. 

We enjoyed evening drinks on the terrace and again for breakfast. Food was great!! Breakfast was buffet but of a very good standard. 

Really loved the experience and would recommend to couples and families. ",5,2015,07,15
119,"""A must""","This was an anniversary treat and lived up to all expectations.  It's like being on a cruise ship but without the swaying.  The plush room with a balcony, the pre-dinner drinks on deck, the restaurant with amazing views and excellent food.  Professional but friendly staff, highly recommend and will definitely return.",5,2015,07,15
119,"Great location, good quality......shame about the noise!","Good location for visiting the O2. Set in a lovely dick area with restaurants and shops close by. Easy access to central London and the 02 via the DLR and tube. The hotel is very well presented and is very clean and tidy. The facilities are great. The staff are nice and friendly. The view from the river, dock and bar are amazing. The only downside is that the bar is overly expensive for what is available. The rooms dont all come with bathrobes which for a 4 star hotel should be as standard in all rooms. The tea, coffee facillities are great but the minibar was empty?! Not sure why when they took a desposit upon arrival. The beds are marketed as king size but the room i stayed in was a twin that had been pushed together and kept moving apart! Not fantastic but i understand the need for the room to be adaptable. The bathrooms are well appointed and good quality toiletries are provide if you have forgotten any. The bathroom overall was quite small considering the size of the rest of the room. The rooms all come with good quality wifi as standard and a tablet ineach room allows you to book room service etc.
The stay was spoilt by a continuous noise that was crossed between banging on sheet metal and a qashing machine on spin cycle which continued all through the night meaning i was unable to sleep. The staff were apologetic but didnt move my room as no other river view rooms were available. I would stay again but if the room hdd the same awful noise i would most likely move to another room or nearby hotel.",4,2015,07,15
119,Luxury,"What an amazing place, right in London docklands over looking O2, we took our car, which we parked in a secure car park opposite the Suborn for 15 pounds  for 24 hours. Cant wait to go again, next time we are in London, this is definitely on top of the list for choice, staff polite and helpful and food wonderful, room service great, love it...have a big bed and balcony with dock views, very clean.",5,2015,07,15
119,The Jury's Out,"Sorry I can't make my mind up. It ticks the 4 star boxes in comparison to other hotels but I didn't feel I was on a yacht which was the main novelty of booking here. I suppose I should of gone on a cruise for that. We never ate on board so cannot comment on this. Nice big room. The bar was okay as were the cocktails. You're on your own peeps for this one but it's worth staying here for local stuff like Greenwich, The O2 and Exel otherwise if your up town, stay up town.",4,2015,07,15
119,Unique experience,"I booked two rooms on the Sunborn whilst visiting the London Boat Show at the Excel. The location for the Excel was perfect, literally a 2 minute walk from the main entrance. 
When we arrived the concierge met us to take our bags, once checked in we were shown our room/cabin. 
The reception was very grand & the rooms were of a very high specification & very spacious. 
We ate in the restaurant which was a lovely setting and food was great. 
Would definitely stay here again if visiting the Excel.",5,2015,07,15
119,Christmas gifts!,"We stayed at this hotel as we walked over the O2 on the 6th of Feb and had tickets to watch Strictly Come Dancing on the Saturday.  The hotel was lovely and we couldn't have asked for more.  The location was perfect for us, the staff were very attentive and helpful when required to be and the atmosphere was lovely.  We ate in the restaurant on the Friday night and the food was amazing. We sat by the window at the front looking over at the O2 and it was lovely.  We also used the bar which had a lovely relaxed atmosphere.  Our room was brilliant, comfortable and immaculately clean, with one of the best showers I've ever used! Could not fault anything and cannot wait to go back sometime soon!",5,2015,07,13
119,Great experience,"I found the Sunborn not only to be the ultimate hotel extravaganza in London. It is a solid, professional, well run and maintained hotel, where everything works perfectly. Personnel is kind and attentive, service is kind and rooms are surprisingly large. I really enjoyed the strange but exciting experience of a luxury -quite romantic- on water yacht hotel. Something I will keeping coming back for in the next years. The hotel is a little bit far from the center of the city, but placed in a new modern and plaesant area well connected with the tube.",5,2015,07,13
119,Over night stay,"We stayed on board the Sunborn hotel on 7/7/15 and was very surprised. The stay was outstanding. The staff were helpful and friendly and the room was out of this world with all the mod cons.
It was something different instead of the traditional hotel and was great for access to the O2 with a cable car across the water. 
If you do not like heights a taxi will take about 15 minutes and costs £20.00.
Fully recommend this for a stay. Breakfast was the best we have ever had and we have eaten all around the world. Well worth the money for all you can eat.",5,2015,07,13
119,"Weekend break, a little treat!","Decided to treat ourselves on a weekend trip to London, we'd been given tickets to Ed Sheeran at Wembley, quite a distance away, but well worth it. The room and staff were fabulous. The little touches make a big difference, and the bed was exceptionally good. We're fussy with the size and quality of a bed and this matched our high standards.",5,2015,07,12
119,Amazing hotel.,"We had a fantastic stay, the hotel is stunning and our room was lovely. The reception staff are a credit to the company and it is a perfect location for anyone going to the O2 to experience a bit of added luxury ...Excellent :0)",5,2015,07,12
119,nothing to complain about,"What a great trip we had. The staff were very helpful, the beds comfortable, the view lovely. We had read reviews that moaned about the food but we found it fine. Breakfast was varied and plentiful. We had a great time ,thank you Sunbourne staff",5,2015,07,12
119,Sunborn - great venue,"I launched my London office adjacent to Excel, on Tuesday 16th June. My only disappointment was in not being able to actually stay on the boat.  I'll resolve that another day! 

The arrangements for the launch were all done via a very professional events company named). The theme was set by the events company based on several options they provided. We went with a drinks tasting option based on the connection between the sea and the drinks. 

Everything went on time, in budget and with great success. Victor Brierley & Kate O'Neill from the events company knew their stuff inside out. The drinks selection included rum, whisky, gin and some incredibly rare ""one-off"" bottlings of each. 

Food was also provided, from a selection which included 5 choices and puddings. Victor & Kate had fun stories to tell about the origins of the drinks, and were great entertainers for the whole period. They actually stayed with us for over 5 hours (above and beyond!) and made sure everyone was happy. 

Overall, the experience was magical. Our guests enjoyed themselves, we knew we were in good hands, and the whole night went without a hitch. Great value, great fun and a great way to ""launch"" an office. 

I thoroughly recommend Sunborn as a venue.   Think about; birthdays, anniversary parties, Christmas events, office parties, client nights and frankly anything where a good night is required.",4,2015,07,12
119,40th wedding anniversary weekend.,"We booked this as a surprise for my sister and her husband for their 40th.  We had 2 executive cabins and we booked the romantic package.  Amazing.   Romao Catrapona and his staff treated us like royalty.   Nothing was too much trouble.   Rooms were amazing, petals on the beds and the best chocolates we've ever had.   We had cocktails and Pimms at the bar, wonderful.   Dinner was superb too.  A weekend to remember.  My sister and her husband were delighted.",5,2015,07,11
119,Something different,"We stayed here for one night as we were going to a show at the O2 , the location is perfect as its only a few minutes walk to the cable cars that take you straight to the O2 . 
Check in was very slow .
We had a lovely large clean room with a balcony overlooking the river with complimentary water in the mini fridge .
It was lovely to sit outside at the back of the yacht and enjoy the glorious sunshine , however the service is very slow we waited for over 20 minutes for someone to come and take our drinks order !!! Then another 20 for drinks to arrive !!! 
This happened again later in the evening so next time we went to the bar ourselves and still were kept waiting . . . This spoilt it . . . 
However when our food arrived it was delicious . We also had breakfast and again it was delicious with so much choice , and what a difference to the previous evening the staff were all very friendly as so attentive . 
We would definitely stay here again although I would most probably go elsewhere in the evening for drinks .",4,2015,07,11
119,Get your Cruise Fix.,"Cruise lovers who are missing the life on the ocean wave and the pampered experience of a luxurious cabin dweller can get a quick fix between voyages here. They will not be disappointed. 
Be warned however that the Yacht Executive Family cabins will spoil you for anything below Grill Class on the Cunard liners or Aqua cabins on Celebrity. Speciality dining is matched in the Lands End restaurant but don't expect a speedy bar service like at Bellini's on the Princess boats. 
No seasickness risk and no queues though! ",5,2015,07,11
119,"Great hotel, ingenious idea, needs updates","It's a bit far from downtown, but that is a personal choice - just be aware. The concept is really clever and the boat is lovely. The bar staff is quite friendly and the food was delicious.
Now the negatives: it needs major updates. The carpet was pretty dirty and the decor is early 90s. I'm talking gold brass coffee table. And we got stuck in the elevator twice. All in all, nice place!",4,2015,07,10
119,Amazing must do experience!,"I booked this hotel for my partners birthday as a surprise and it definitely didn't disappoint. I mentioned at the time of the booking that it was for a special occasion and the staff definitely pulled out all of the stops. The boat is exceptionally clean. The beds have a lovely thick mattress topper making them very comfy! Foam pillows are provided but you can request feather pillows. There is no road near by therefore you don't have to cope with the noise of traffic......during the day there is the occasional aeroplane though. The tube station is a short walk away. I found the food and wine reasonably priced. We only had a snack on the boat (Chorizo and bread) which was lovely so apart from that I cant comment on the food, but there are lots or restaurants near the boat if you don't fancy anything on the boat, or nip over to the 02 and there's lots of chain restaurants there.

Overall it was a very enjoyable experience and I would definitely go back again as its excellent value for money in London. Only issue is how do I improve on my partners birthday present next year!

Tip: I surprised my partner as they had no idea this is where we were staying up until when we arrived. Catch the emirates airline from the 02 arena side and you can point the ship out to them whilst up in the air.",5,2015,07,10
119,Partner's 50th birthday ,What an amazing hotel. We had a beautiful large room overlooking the Thames with views of the O2. The staff were very friendly and helpful. We would definitely stay here again. The manager hand wrote a letter to my partner wishing him a happy birthday which was a lovely touch.,5,2015,07,09
119,Amazing Experiece!!!,"My Husband Booked the sunborn for our wedding Anniversary, which was a surprise for me, and i can tell you it was beautiful i was truly over whelmed.. the hotel its self was immaculate, the staff were very helpful and friendly, when they knew it was our anniversary after we had checked in they came up with complementary made chocolates the room was big and spacious, with a balcony very comfy the best hotel i have stayed in for along time. i would definatly go back again, and would recommend anyone to go, although the prices are not cheap!!",5,2015,07,09
119,Really pleasantly surprised,"Lovely hotel, big rooms, nice facilities & friendly staff. Perfect if attending a conference at Excel. Exec room facing river was lovely - was a family room with superking bed and double sofabed. Coffee machine, tablet & bathrobes were a nice touch and balcony lovely on a summer evening. Will be back.",5,2015,07,08
119,Great view...great meal,"A big thank you to Lands End Restaurant for a wonderful meal tonight.  Maxime our waiter was ""the best"", we had the set menu, which was delicious and represented excellent value for money.  This hotel is unusual, but we have been deliciously surprised.  Big rooms, well appointed, comfy beds.....what more do you need?",5,2015,07,08
119,AMAZING LUXURIOUS EXPERIENCE,"Stayed on the Yacht In June, wow what an amazing experience!

The service was outstanding!! I was rather impressed with the service on reception particularly Romao Catrapona who was the shift leader!

I have booked again and can't wait! This time for two nights!",5,2015,07,08
119,Unique experience,"I booked this hotel as a surprise for my husbands birthday. When we arrived there were a few glitches with the booking but these were rectified ASAP. The yacht is absolutely immaculate and well designed/decorated. The room was very spacious and clean and had everything you need for a perfect stay. The Sunday brunch was beautiful and the service provided by Bilal was outstanding, such a attentive, happy person providing great service.

Would definitely recommend this hotel to family and friends and visit again in the future",5,2015,07,08
119,Big smoke on the water,"This was a lovely change from the usual London chain hotels, we've stayed in a few and in term of ammenities, the Sunborn was no better or worse than most but you can't beat the spectacle of this luxury yacht if you want something a bit special. The beauty isn't only skin deep either, inside is just as nice as outside. Everything from the glimmering lobby to the decor of the rooms is fitting and first rate. Our room was on the first floor with a river facing window affording a lovely view just above the water. The bed was comfortable, the shower strong and hot and with water that actually felt nice instead of the usual hard London water that makes your hair feel dirty after a wash (although that might be just me) Extremely impressed with the Molton Brown toiletries too.

Our contact with staff was minimal but check in and out was smooth.
Unfortunately I also can't comment on the dining as after a busy day exploring the city we didn't have the energy. Same with breakfast, it wasnt included in our rate and at £14 was a bit steep for those of us who aren't particularly breakfast people anyway. The bar and dining areas were lovely though with spectacular views towards Canary Wharf and O2

It is located about 30 mins outside the main tourist area, but has plenty of bars and places to eat close by. I imagine the area gets very busy when there are events on at O2 (accessable in minutes by cable car) or the Excel but there was nothing this weekend and it was just right for us. Probably, also how we were able to take advantage of reasonable room rates. From Euston station we rode the northern line to Waterloo, changed to Jubilee line to Canning Town then switching to the DLC and alighting at custom house. One morning we got a taxi to the Greenwich foot tunnel entrance for a tenner, then took the clipper into the city after spending the morning in Greenwich.

Overall, we would definitely stay again for a treat but it's not somewhere we will use ever time purely because of her location in relation to the west end which is normally our reason for coming to London. The sight of the yacht had the desired effect on the person for whom it was a birthday surprise and the inside didn't disappoint either.
Thank you for a memorable visit ",4,2015,07,08
119,A different experience. Lovely room,"Really wasn't sure what to expect (as had visions of bunk beds and a tiny space similar to cabins in ferry) but very pleased with the extremely spacious room which felt like a suite with a  bedroom and sitting room area and pleasant bathroom. Plush carpets, beautiful wood finish units and a superking size bed made our stay very comfortable. Molton Brown toiletries and nice fluffy towels were a nice touch. Recommend asking for room on the side of boat facing away from dock wall as we were close to the entranceway which initially creaked everytime the wind blew but this settled after a few hours so did not spoil our stay. Bar area quiet but pleasant although drinks a little expensive but nicely presented. Lovely breakfast with attentive serving staff and a great view of the river. This is a fab location if attending the exhibition centre. Great location and view of regenerated docklands. The cablecar over to the O2 is well worth a trip for the views over London for the price of a tube ticket and the docklands light railway is within walking distance. Be prepared to walk from multi- storey parking to the Yacht - about - 7- 10minutes and parking not cheap ( but this is expected in London). We really enjoyed our stay and will visit again.",5,2015,07,07
119,Something different!,"Exec king room dockside. Can see a lot of reviews recommending river view, but it's just as pleasant overlooking the Excel. 
Room is wonderful, thick carpet, extremely clean and all the furnishings feel brand new. Staff are lovely and very helpful. Room is very quiet and beds are comfy. Lavazza pod coffee machine in room. There are complimentary tea and a few coffee pods left in the room each day. Iron and ironing board in room, safe and fridge which has a couple of complimentary bottles of water in, which were replaced each day along with the tea and coffee.  Free wifi is a bonus! 
Staying on a yacht is a unique experience and it's lovely to wonder around and sit on the balcony or in the bar which has a sun deck, although you do forget you are on the river as the yacht doesn't move at all, not even a little sway! So don't worry if you are not sure about staying on board a yacht, once the curtains close, it's just a fantastic spacious comfy quiet room!",5,2015,07,07
119,A trip saved,I initially booked this through booking.com who contacted me on the first day of my stay at 15:15 to say it was double booked and the hotels fault. I made my way to the hotel and it transpired I was not the only one in this predicament. A big thank you to the duty manager Apostolas who sorted through the mess. I had a wonderful stay onboard a fantastic hotel with great staff. This hotel is quite unique and a great place to stay.,5,2015,07,07
119,Amazing Location and Stunning Hotel - Service and Afternoon Tea Dissapointing,"The Location and the Hotel are absolutely stunning, we were blown away by the beautiful surroundings and how wonderful the Yacht was.
We were visiting the restaurant for an afternoon tea -  it was only a day visit.
I had requested a gluten free afternoon tea, well in advance - I Found this to be disappointing, no cake provided for the tea, only Sandwiches and a few biscuits from a packet followed by a fruit salad.
We were a little disappointed by the staff in the restaurant area as we had to ask for more drinks and were not asked if everything was ok etc.
It was a shame because the actual hotel is beautiful.",3,2015,07,07
119,Great hospitality in the heart of Royal Docks,"An amazing experience while celebrating mine and a friend birthday. Excellent service, the food was amazing, fresh and delicious!!! Thank you to Peter & Maxime for their 5* service. DEFINITELY will come back !!! ",5,2015,07,06
119,Great setting but that's all you'll get.,"I booked an Executive Riverview room for two nights from 4-6 July and was very much looking forward to staying somewhere different from central London. I regularly visit 4 and 5 star hotels in London, so i'm familiar with what you should get and what you do get at these places. To start off on a good note, the room was lovely and you get a great view of the river and the Yacht itself is impressive and interesting to look at. Nearly everything else was terrible. The lifts in the hotel are slow and unresponsive, so it's hard to get about, especially when you're with a blind companion like I was. The mini bar was empty which for a hotel like this is a joke. When I queried this, I was told they don't do it anymore and they challenged me to say where it said it does. For starters I booked in January and it did state it had a mini bar and amazingly after being challenged on this point by the hotel, it even stated they have a mini bar on the computer tablet IN MY ROOM. Regardless, virtually all 2 and 3 star hotels have mini bars, so it's embarrassing for a hotel like this not to have one. They also have no interactive/pay movies facility in the room, which again is just bog standard in any two bit hotel, let alone in a setting like this. I asked reception and they didn't even know if they had this facility or not, let alone gave the impression of caring. The bar is nice to be in IF the staff can be bothered to serve you (except for a very good and embarrassed Polish barman) . It takes ages to get a drink even if the bar is half empty and it's so disorganised it's beyond belief. You can't even get an olive to go in your Martini (two days straight) and the biggest let down was, they couldn't really care less. The staff are totally disinterested and detached. If you can get them to look up, don't expect a smile or any sort of hospitality. The senior staff, don't care if you have an issue, they just feed you a tired excuse rather than being embarrassed and busting a gut to remedy the situation. This is one of those hotels that pose as 4 or 5 star but give you a service that wouldn't be up to par in a hostel. In days gone by, you would be offered a full or partial refund for a stay like this but there are no owners around and the staff have no stake, so they simply don't care. As well as pleasure I was asked to see if i'd recommend the hotel to clients and for functions but there's not much chance of that. The Sunborn has all the potential to be a great hotel but massive changes need to be made for this to be the case.",1,2015,07,06
119,Not without faults but all were dealt with efficiently,"Before we travelled we did look at the reviews but the good far out weighed the bad. We arrived check-in efficient & yes the do take £40 per night holding fee for damage etc. 
Our room was lovely but I must say the pods for the coffee machine were on the scarce side. 
The temperature in our room was a constant 24.5 & this wasn't pleasant overnight - a few of the negative reviews were about this but we ignored them. In the morning we complained and were immediately upgraded to a junior suite!",4,2015,07,06
119,Weekend stay in a family room,"This hotel was amazing. The staff were efficient and very friendly. Nothing was too much trouble. My 12 year old son described our stay as ""being treated like Royalty"". I stay in hotels regularly for work and pleasure and I have to say this is one of the best I have stayed in. The rooms are very clean, spacious and nicely furnished. The breakfast buffet was fresh and hot with plenty of choice.",5,2015,07,06
119,Stunning Property!,"We visited the Sunborn for a business function/party this weekend.  I must admit, i wish we had booked a room here because the property is simply stunning.  We had drinks on the top deck for a couple of hours, taking in the amazing views of London.",5,2015,07,06
119,Weekend stay in Line London,"An amazing hotel, with a luxurious feel and appearance. Really friendly helpful staff. It is in a great location ideally suited for O2 events and easy access to anywhere in London. If you want to impress someone book the Sunbourn Yacht Hotel!",5,2015,07,05
119,"Somewhere different, very good.","If you want to stay somewhere different in London, try the Sunborn.

Great accommodation, spotlessly clean and amazing service at check in and check out. The bar behind reception was good though the service here was abit slow. The bar has a great setting whether seated inside or outside on the deck.

Breakfast is spectacular with an amazing buffet selection.

Strongly recommend.",4,2015,07,03
119,Luxury stay at reasonable price !,"Stayed here for two nights while attending a conference at the ExCel, and couldn't fault any aspect of it, from the efficient, friendly reception while booking in, the quality and cleanliness of the room and the excellent food on offer at breakfast and evening meal. The standard room was all polished wood and brass finished with mirrors, a big oval porthole, coffee capsule machine as well as kettle, in-room fridge with complimentary water (essential with the recent weather), iron and board, safe, and plenty of room for a double couch and table set well apart from the very comfortable bed.
A nice touch was a tablet, on which you could access the hotel directory, room service, local travel and weather, and open internet access at no extra charge.
10 minutes walk away from the Emirates cable car that takes you over the dock and the river to the O2, and from a range of eating places on the dockside.
I've already looked at the possibility of a short break here later in the year (prices compare very well with the usual land-based hotels) and wouldn't hesitate to recommend this as a unique and quality place to stay.",5,2015,07,03
119,"Quirky, luxury and great value","Well its certainly different but I loved it. 

BIG rooms for anywhere but especially for a London hotel, high quality furnishings and the deepest pile carpet in a hotel ever. 

Staff couldn't have been more helpful. 

I'd definitely get a price for a London trip again. Sure, its a little way out but not impossible and its easy to find. A trip on the Emirates cablecar was a fun way to arrive.",5,2015,07,03
119,Luxury and convenience,"Really pleased we stayed here the night we went to the O2. Yacht was incredible, couldn't believe we were staying on it - looked like a playboy's weekend boat! Staff were polite, upgraded us to a better room for no particular reason. Obviously the trip was around seeing the concert, but the room impressed us - clean, decent shower, comfy bed etc. To summarise; the beauty of it is its location - gig finished at 10.50pm - we were back on board with a glass of prosecco by 11.10pm while everyone else was trying to get that last train home. Didn't stay for the breakfast - 40 quid is a lot I think for eggs and bacon and there's plenty of restaurants that do better in the city. Overall, a real taste of luxury, for a reasonable price.",5,2015,07,02
119,Excellent !!,"Recently stayed for 1 night on the Sunborn, From the moment we got there staff excellent and very friendly and a very relaxed atmosphere from the start of the visit .
Food very good too !! but only had bar meal - Restaurant full (which speaks for itself)",5,2015,07,02
119,Great for families too,Have just had a fantastic 2 night stay on The Sunborn with my husband and 2 children. We were made to feel very welcome the minute we stepped on board. Travelling with children can sometimes be tricky but the room that we had was a great size and plenty big enough for the 4 of us with some lovely little extras too. We opted for an Executive Room with balcony which was well worth the extra.  We didn't use the restaurant but there are several reasonably priced places to eat in the vicinity.  The location was great with several transport options into central London or over to the O2.  Thank you to Romao and team for a very memorable stay.,4,2015,07,02
119,Amazing hotel,It was our silver wedding on arrival we were met by the General manager and staff they made us feel like royalty they couldn't do enough for us like courtesy chocolates delivered to our room and complimentery champagne from the general manager.all the staff from reception to restaurant they are amazing thanks again sunborn we will remember our stay for a long time and will definitely be returning 😊😊😊😊😊😊,5,2015,07,02
119,Not quite there yet!,"Stayed at the Sunborn for a night on a tour of London.  The yacht is absolutely fantastic - lovely reception area and beautiful spacious cabins with nice shower rooms, fluffy towels, really comfy beds and everything spotlessly clean.  However, the experience was let down by the general disorganisation on-board.   Although the staff were very very polite, friendly and accommodating, they didn't seem to be in control of things. Three different members of staff told our party three different times for restaurant opening hours.  The breakfast was a bit of a shambles - people having to wait for hot plates to be re-stocked, tables quite cramped so people bumping into you as they went past.    If the management got these few small things under control, then it would probably be faultless.

Did not have time to eat in the restaurant on the yacht in the evening (due to tour time constraints) and could not find anywhere in local vicinity that opened early enough (ie 5.30 ish) except pub.  Food there was pretty awful!",4,2015,07,01
119,30th Birthday Break,"I surprised my boyfriend with a one night stay at this amazing hotel for his 30th birthday. We was both very impressed when we first arrived, then we was greeted by the reception staff who were very helpful and friendly. 

We were given a complimentry upgrade, when we arrived to our room we were amazed. The room was massive with its own living area and we had a lovely balcony that faced onto the river. The views were phenomonal, especially of a night. 

We ended up in the bar in the evening, we were served straight away and we sat on the deck with the view of the O2 and the rest of London right in front of us. It was very calm and relaxing, the views and the calmness really made our evening. 

We ordered a few drinks with the room service, they arrived within 5 minutes.

The next morning we had breakfast in the restaurant. The food was lovely, we couldnt fault a thing.

We would definitely recommend anyone thinking about booking this hotel, to not hesistate. We will definitely be returning 100%. 

Thank you to Romao Catrapona and the all the staff at Sunborn London for really making our trip relaxing and very enjoyable.",5,2015,07,01
119,First class service,"From the moment we stepped on board we really felt that we were on a luxury yacht.  The staff were so helpful and friendly, and couldn't do enough for us.  The room was amazing, it was so clean and really spacious, you even get molton brown cosmetics in the bathroom, and there is a proper coffee maker as well as a kettle.  We spent quite a bit of time sat out on deck at the sundown bar and the cocktails and prosseco were great, they were a little expensive but not what i would call ridiculous.  We ate in the restaurant and the food was beautiful, however we did not have breakfast there as it was £20 a head and there was a cafe over the road that did a full english breakfast with toast, chips and a drink for £4.95 so we went there both mornings. The nearest tube station is custom house, can definately recommend getting an oyster card if you are going to use the tube a bit while you're there, you can also use the card to pay for the Emirates air line cable car which is well worth a trip its a five minute walk from the sunborn and it takes you over to the o2 at greenwich, also the cable car is cheaper if you have an oyster card think it was about £3.60 so its very reasonably priced.  There are also quite a few bars and restaurants within 5 minutes radius of the yacht if you decide to eat out.  We will definately be going back.",5,2015,07,01
119,Stunning Hotel,"Stayed at this hotel as we were going to a concert at the o2. 
very convenient as we got the Emirates sky train over. Hotel is beautifully clean. ~Rooms are spacious and well appointed. Beds really comfortable. Was not too expensive. In fact breakfast was £12.50 each which I thought was fantastic value for money.
Definitely stay again.",5,2015,07,01
119,Excellent but not quite,"The location is good either for the Excel center or the city itself. Train station in near enough, no problem with luggage.
Rooms are quite big and well equipped. Pesonnel at the reception are wery friendly.
A little minus for the service was in the breakfast room. It seemed, that they were a little unexperienced and to get a proper cup of coffee was a little bit hit and miss.",4,2015,07,01
119,Luxury,"Myself and partner opted to stay in this beautiful hotel on water, for a romantic weekend away.  

It was worth every penny. The yacht has a very grand staircase on entering. It's beautifully clean. The staff on the front desk were very polite, friendly and helpful.  

We asked if we could upgrade to a water view room and it's was dealt with, with no hassle at all. On arrival to our room we were amazed at the space. There was a living room area and the your sleeping space. It was all decorated with a lovely wood finish and mirrored walls. 

It is also very close to all amenities such as a tescos, and various bars and restaurants. Also to mention is parking, there is a large multi-story car park, 2 minutes away from the yacht. The cost for parking was also very reasonable along with the cost of our night stay. 

Overall I would definitely recommended a stay here, especially for couples. We were also kindly refunded what we had paid for our breakfast as we did not ride in time for it:)",5,2015,06,30
119,Different and nice,"It's different, having a cabin not a room.  Still, I like this place the rooms are clean and light on the upper decks.
The staff make the place from Naz on reception to the team in the bar they all treat you really well and are happy to have a laugh.
Location is great, next door to the Excell with a few restaurants and bars around.
Only 5 stops from Canary 
Wharf on the DLR as well.
",5,2015,06,29
119,Absolutely Amazing experience will 100% return,"Executive suite, beautiful room. Staff were brilliant could not be more polite and friendly, especially the young lady on reception Manjiam (hope I spelt this correctly). We went to see Fleetwood Mac at the O2 it was a simple 5 minute walk away from the cable cars, which was a pleasurable experience also. Plenty of restaurants and bars. I would 100% recommend the Sunborn and will most definitely be returning. Two very happy customers.",5,2015,06,29
119,Excellent Hotel,"Stayed here with my daughter for 1 night as we were going to a concert at the O2.  Highly impressed with the room which was much bigger than we expected. Everything in it was spotless and luxurious. The beds and pillows were possibly the most comfortable I have ever slept in. Another great feature is the soundproofing which was much needed as there was quite loud music playing in the corridors and planes flying overhead but once the room door was shut we couldn't hear a thing. Also the curtains were total blackout so once the lights were off the room was pitch black - perfect for a great nights sleep. My only slight grumble is the slow service at the bar but we were staying at the same time as a convention and when the gentleman in front of me ordered 6 cocktails, I knew we were in for a long wait! Overall we loved it and would definitely stay again",5,2015,06,29
119,Fantastic,"Stayed with my brother as we were attending the O2. Lifts weren't working on arrival but a helpful member of staff was on hand to show us an alternative route. By the time we had checked in, changed and had a drink in the bar overlooking the dock the lifts were up and running again. 
Our room was superbly furnished, had a great view and even a tablet in case you forget your own - a nice touch. 
Excellent for the O2 just 15 minutes away by public transport. Yes there are cheaper alternatives in the area but not much so and to my mind the quality and uniqueness of the place combined with the friendliness and professionalism of the staff were worth the few extra pounds. 
The only small criticism I have is that on our return we had to wait a fair time to get a drink at the bar. Had we sat at a table we would probably been served more quickly as there were several waiters but only one bartender who was serving both bar customers and waiters. The bartender also did not serve customers in the order that they arrived at the bar. Unfortunately this is a pet niggle of mine having been in the hospitality trade myself. It is also quite a common situation but not one to affect what was otherwise a superb experience. 
We did not dine in the restaurant in the evening but the breakfast in the morning was excellent so I am sure the food would have been to a very high standard. 
If you are visiting the O2 or Excel which is only a 2 minute walk away I would highly recommend it. It is also perfect for a romantic weekend away. 
",5,2015,06,29
119,great place for drinks when you are doing an event at ExCel,"Great for drinks when you are doing an event at ExCel.  It actually feels like you are on a real cruise ship, down to the very last detail.  The bartenders are great, the service incredible... You must go if you are at the ExCel.",5,2015,06,29
119,Mostly great,"There's a real buzz about arriving and going aboard - if the sun is shining and you can sit out on the deck, with its amazing views, it makes for a very special experience. The size of the rooms are nothing short of extraordinary for a London hotel and the whole ship is spotlessly clean and shiny. I must concur with previous reviewers about the restaurant, the food is nothing special but the service was Ok and the cost of the food is OK too, given the location.  However, the service in the bar is very poor indeed. The drinks take ages to arrive, food longer still and when ours did  arrive it was short of some constituent parts with no explanation, acknowledgement or apology. A hot chocolate was delivered to us as a glass of hot milk with a sachet of drinking chocolate in the saucer - a diy drink if you will.  For £4! We did laugh and the bar did deduct it from the bill but it's the type of thing which demonstrates inadequate training and shouldn't be evident in a hotel of this calibre.  The service charge is irritating given all this and we had It deducted upon checking out.",4,2015,06,28
119,Excellent venue and location,"The Sunborn floating hotel bar and resteraunts is a really great venue. Much much more than a yacht - I had the pleasure of eating and drinking here whilst on business. The dining staff were professional friendly and attentive. They arranged flexible food options. The bar was pleasant and the interior is very nicely decorated

An excellent venue, I'd highly recommend",5,2015,06,28
119,A very special visit,Visited as a gift from my grown up children for my 50 Birthday. Arrival was very welcoming and we were given an upgrade to a river side balcony. The Yacht was a really different experiance and not just another hotel. Rooms much bigger than you would expect. The food was also truly fit for a 5 star Yacht. Thank you.,5,2015,06,27
119,Fabulous floating hotel,"My partner surprised me with a one night stay and we had a super time. The hotel is spotlessly clean throughout. The front of house team are nothing short of amazing, so friendly and helpful. The rooms are very spacious with a living area as well as a superbly comfortable king sized bed. Motlon Brown toiletries are supplied as well as complimentary mineral water.

My only criticism is the service in the bar-it was very slow on both occasions we visited and we ended up going to the bar to order our own drinks as it was so much quicker. I'm sure with some staff training this can easily be rectified. The deck is a perfect place to sit and enjoy your drinks with an amazing view of the city when the sun is out.

We are returning with our son in a few weeks time for a 2 night stay and we can't wait to show him around. This is the perfect location if you are visiting the O2, the Excel or just want to explore this side of London. We got a great deal by going direct through the hotel's website.",5,2015,06,27
119,Relaxing stay,"Would recommend a stay at the Sunbirn London.  All staff friendly especially Maryian on reception.  The room was spacious, very clean, beds comfortable and shower great.  Breakfast was very good with plenty of choice and staff very efficient.   Easy access to O2 via the cable car.  Will definitely be returning for longer next time.",5,2015,06,26
119,Nice idea that mostly works....,"Stayed here a couple of times now. The only thing I can fault is the bar. It is nothing short of a shambles. We have taken to going elsewhere in the area as the twice we've been there tables aren't cleared, the staff don't seem to know what they are doing.

No draught beer/lager/cider is irritating as its only bottles or cocktails.

The 'discretionary service charge' is annoying as the service doesn't warrant it.

Some of the supervisors also need a attitude adjustment as they have a very unfortunate disposition when it comes to dealing with customers or their colleagues.",4,2015,06,26
119,Perfect Hotel,Great luxury hotel ideal for O2 and excel -the rooms are luxurious and spacious with quality fixtures and fittings. The deck offers great cocktails which are reasonably priced. Offers great views of London.,5,2015,06,26
119,"Fantastic venue, superb staff - excellent stay and event!","A huge thank you to the brilliant Hugo from Events & Marketing, Nazma, Agne, Stefano and the rest of the thoughtful Front of House crew, and the wonderful F&B staff who supported the smooth running of our evening event: Migte, Greg, Raul, Alessandro, Ana Carolina and Ivan, amongst many others. What a friendly, engaging and attentive team. Your enthusiasm, warmth and professionalism made such a positive impact - creating a stay and event that guests are still raving about (""best event ever"", ""superb venue"", ""loved every minute""). Really delighted with the quality of service, the generous room size (even entry-level classic rooms feel like junior suites), the interesting presentation and entertaining spaces, and the ease with which an exceptional event was put together. The yacht setting, with sunset views across the Thames towards the City, is utterly gorgeous and being located just 100 metres from ExCel London makes the Sunborn the perfect choice for delegate events. Highly recommended, whether for a leisure break, a corporate meeting or special celebration.",5,2015,06,26
119,Perfect simple as ..,Stayed here for 2 nights during the conference. VFM better than any hotel stayed in London. Drinks service exception. Cleanliness 100%. Staff could not do enough for you. Food very nice and breakfasts so relaxed.  Free WiFi that always worked.  Cant wait to go back. Thank you,5,2015,06,26
119,fabulous!,"Stayed here 3 nights on business. Was lucky to receive an upgrade.se I ate room service first night then entertained clients next 2 nights for dinner. Excellent food and 
Service. Special mention to Allessandro. Overall experience fabulous.",5,2015,06,25
119,overnight stay,"we could not find one thing wrong, the food and the service was excellent,rooms very clean and comfortable,location easy to get to, can not wait to return which will not be long and a longer stay,would recommend this hotel 100%",5,2015,06,25
119,Unique Experience!,"We stayed here in March as it was in close proximity to the 02, walking up from the train station really has the WOW factor when you see it in the distance - its right outside the ExCel.  Check is was quick and we were directed to our room - you have to get in the lift  from the pavement to go up to reception and then because of where our room was back in the lift and go down below pavement level.  This was a little strange as normally in a hotel you have interaction with the reception when walking to your room but none of that here!! our room was a large room with seating area and (as requested) a sea view.  We paid £260 for 2 nights here and in my opinion was a absolute bargain and will being staying here on our next visit to the 02!",5,2015,06,25
119,Very Good in all areas. ,"Stayed here whilst in London for a gig at O2. Very impressed start to finish. From approach to the hotel itself to the service, to the food and last but definitely not least the rooms. All to a very high standard. Already looking at booking again. 
Thanks Sunborn. ",5,2015,06,25
119,Fantastic - a real gem in the City!!,"We have just returned from the most wonderful stay at the Sunborn Yacht Hotel and all we can say is - this place is AMAZING!! We booked this hotel as we wanted somewhere to stay close to the O2 where we were seeing the wonderful Fleetwood Mac in concert and we could not have found a more perfect place! It is also well located for the Emirates Cable Car for transport to the O2, ExCel, City Airport and Docklands Light Railway. In addition, access to the Sunborn is only 5 minutes from the Blackwall Tunnel, there are also lots of nearby parking options available.
Upon arrival we received a very warm welcome from the Reception staff, a delayed journey meant we were slightly late for the champagne lunch we had arranged on board. This wasn't a problem though, as we were shown to the restaurant immediately and were reassured that we could check in afterwards. Lunch was superb, enjoyed in a beautiful, peaceful setting overlooking the Royal Victoria Dock and Canary Wharf. 
When we finally got to our room we were amazed at the size of it, a huge bed and additional seating area, overlooking the river too - beautiful! Tea & coffee making facilities with a very well equipped bathroom with Molton Brown toiletries were very welcome additions to the room.
The following morning we enjoyed breakfast in the restaurant, there was a large variety of food offered as a buffet, comprising English breakfast, continental option, pastries, cereals and fruit. Again a very friendly welcome was received from the restaurant staff upon our arrival.
Although we only stayed for one night the Sunborn was so difficult to leave. It really is a stunning, unique hotel offering 5-star accommodation with a team of staff who are a credit to the organisation, offering the best customer care at all times. Our special thanks must go to Nazma on Reception, her most pleasant manner and efficiency was first-class, and also thank you to Apostolos who made our visit very special by taking time out of his day to take us on a mini tour of the yacht, explaining the history of it to us, allowing us the opportunity to find out more about Sunborn.

We left the Sunborn promising ourselves that this will not be our last visit, thank you to all staff for making our stay so very special. We found a real gem in the City and can't wait until our return!",5,2015,06,23
119,Quirky luxury.,"We stayed at the Sunborn for one night in June after an event at Hyde Park, we initially chose the hotel due to it's close location to my partner's job the next day, but we have already talked about returning during the summer. Staying at the hotel is like being on the best cruise ship you have ever seen, the rooms / cabins are huge for a London hotel, and the whole place has a luxury feel. The location is very quiet, and the bed was incredibly comfortable, so a good night's sleep was enjoyed by both of us. The bathroom was surprisingly well appointed, with a great shower and Molton Brown toiletries and there was plenty of storage for clothes / cases in the room too. The staff were courteous, helpful and friendly, the bar looked great with the option of sitting on deck, but we didn't get to enjoy this due to our schedule. I don't feel that we got to fully take advantage of all the Sunborn has to offer, so we will be returning.",5,2015,06,23
119,3rd Visit - Great every time,"I have stayed here twice on business (2014), and the most recent visit (June 2015) for leisure before flying out on holiday from London. The hotel is immaculately presented (as one might expect from a new ""property"") - as soon as you arrive and take the lift to reception you half forget you're on boat! 

The staff are professional, friendly and helpful - the rooms are a decent size and on each occasion I've had a riverside view. Fantastic if you're attending an exhibition, visiting to O2 or travelling into the city. 40 minutes (early morning) to Standstead. Very nice touch to receive hand-written note from the GM in the room.

Restaurant is excellent - good selection and buffet breakfast fresh - great mushrooms - and green tea!

Will definitely stay again; great place to meet clients away from town or excel. Parking in the Ibis is very secure right next door (although £30 a day as non-resident).",5,2015,06,23
119,Truly Amazing,We have just arrived home after a truly amazing 2 night break aboard the Sunborn Yacht Hotel London. My very very sincere thanks must go to Mr Apostolos Fanaris who gave my wife and myself a truly unforgettable experience with his sincere kindness. I thank you so very very much. And to all the staff thank you. The Sunborn is an amazing experience the rooms beautiful and setting lovely. We had an amazing two days aboard. Everyone at some point should experience this unique hotel. Thank you all so very much. We shall be back. ,5,2015,06,23
119,"A very good, fun place to stay","Just had a three night stay at this hotel.  The family room was very spacious and clean. The service at the reception was exceptional.  Nothing was a problem.

The bar area does struggle with service but the staff were very pleasant.  The location is perfect for the docklands, O2 and Canary Wharf.

We would stay again.",5,2015,06,22
119,Awful ,"Went for a Drink to see the place , very disappointed , sat at the bar for 10 mins while the French bar man made cocktails , no Interaction no communication skills didn't even say hello . I ordered a white wine , price not bad a 5 pounds a glass . While sat there a guest came to the bar and ask were his burger was after 30 mins of ordering . I was there half an hour and he didn't order then so must have been longer. The service is not good and no leadership from Anyone. Also talking In French ( non English ) when  working on the bar is bad customer service  . They need a good customer service manager to turn things around .",1,2015,06,21
119,Amazing,"We stayed here the night we went to see Take That at the O2 and it was great, very plush and loved the porthole looking out over the water! The complimentary water in the mini bar was much needed after a hot day crossing London! The chap that took us to our room was lovely and he brought our bags up shortly after.",5,2015,06,21
119,Spa experience,I have been a regular user of the Spa as a non resident as I live locally. I have been very satisfied with service there. Joanna is the beauty therapist I always book and she is very experienced and knowledgeable.  Really enjoy facials and body scrub with her. The Spa is lovely and comfortable. Never feel I am being rushed. The products used are  awesome too. Elemis is a great brand.  Have tried many in the local area and this is the best for service and price.,5,2015,06,21
119,Welcome back to heaven!,"I have stayed here a few month ago on a business trip. Told my partner how much enjoyed the stay and he surprised me with another stay. He organised tickets for Take That at The O2. He booked a River View Room with a private balcony, which was amazing. We ordered some food from Room Service and a bottle of Champagne and the Afternoon couldn't have been better. 
By the way - the concert was awesome and taking the Cable Car to The O2 was an exciting experience. I had a treatment at the Elemis Spa the next morning and it was a disappointment, that the outstanding massage was over after 60 minutes. 
Cant wait for our next anniversary coming back to Sunborn London. ",5,2015,06,19
119,Horrendous,"We visited on 12th June to see if sunborn was a possible wedding venue for upcoming wedding next year. 
It is quite possibly the worst service we have ever had. To be continually given the wrong bill for 2 vodka and tonics to the point where the waiter actually argued with me accusing us of having a bottle of wine was shocking. Don't bother requesting a table in the restaurant.  We did and we're then told it was first come first served. The champagne was warm, the glasses covered in lipstick,  plates left in front of us and not cleared for 20 minutes, mediocre food. Quite possibly the worst ice cream I've ever had! Will not return or recommend. ",1,2015,06,19
119,Luxury superb,"This was the most fantastic stay I have ever had, the staff were first class and made our break a real 1st class experience.. Could not recommend the yacht and the staff enough. The rooms was spotless and really well situated with a beautiful balcony. Thank you to Teo Dora and Keyrern...",5,2015,06,19
119,Fabulous hotel with excellent staff,We stayed here to begin the celebrations for my husbands 50th birthday. I can say that although a little wayoutside the central hustle and bustle of London it is an excellent place with staff that are courteous without being intrusive. A perfect break with a spotlessly clean hotel that is beautiful.,5,2015,06,19
119,Business stay mid week,"Booked this as very local to the O2 but also handy for city airport if that's required. Plenty of local parking and a lovely setting with bars and restaurants near by in a very calm area. Ship itself is stunning and staff couldn't do enough for you ! Ramza on front desk is lovely and a credit to the hospitality trade. Rooms are genuinely 5 star and detail is everywhere, my bed was very very comfy and Egyptian cotton helped the experience. It's different but not difficult to use and a great option to the ordinary hotel stay.",5,2015,06,19
119,A Hotel with a difference!,"This beautiful 'boat' Hotel was amazing! Very nice cabins with comfortable beds, real coffee making facilities and nice little bathrooms complete with Molton Brown toiletries! Perfect for an over night stay whilst going to the O2! Nice bar and lounge area. Great breakfast!",5,2015,06,16
119,Fantastic experience ,"We also chose this Hotel as we were going to the O2 for a Friday night concert and for my wife's birthday. We were upgraded to an Executive room which was fantastic. An excellent base for a stay in London. We used the cable cars, then Clipper River Ferries to travel around. Recommended. The staff were utterly fantastic, and made the stay even more relaxing and enjoyable, Apostolos, made sure my wife's birthday was special, with all members of staff wishing her a happy birthday, from waiter staff to bar staff. A special mention to Marie-Ann, who literally went out of her way to make sure I didn't forget flowers for my wife. 
A truly memorable experience that I hope we repeat again and again .",5,2015,06,16
119,Fantastic,"We looked this hotel our room was beautiful, food was amazing and staff were lovely we will definitely return we also got lovely weather to sit and have cocktails on the deck, fantastic location for the Excel",5,2015,06,16
119,A pleasant surprise,"We stayed  Saturday night while going to a concert at The O2. The cabins are a very good size and spotless. The bathrooms are very small but nothing that causes a problem.
The best things about it all is the staff who are sensational. From the welcome to the bar service right through to check out they were so warm and welcoming.
The only improvement needed is hot plates for the breakfast. Our food became cold very quickly which spoilt the experience.
Apart from that very good indeed and ever in the area we would stay again.",4,2015,06,15
119,amazing hotel!!,"if you want to treat yourself this is the place for you! we went to a concert at the 02 and this place is perfectly located for getting the cable car or tube over to the arena. the rooms are fabulous, as is the reception, bar area and the bars balcony at the rear, overlooking the o2 and canary wharf. the reception staff, concierge, bar staff and the cleaning staff were genuinely friendly, knowledgeable and highly professional. i wouldnt hesitate to recommend the sunborn to anybody!",5,2015,06,14
119,Staying In London - Go The Extra Mile or 2,"We have just got back from another fantastic experience on the Sunborn London where the crew excelled themselves for my partners 50th.  While we were out they decorated the bedroom for us with a few 50th decorations which all added to the experience.  
You might have to travel the extra mile or 2 to get there but if you compare the experience and surroundings with a comparable cost else where in london it is fantastic value for money and worth staying",5,2015,06,14
119,Really enjoyable,"London hotel rooms can be a little small, so I was pleasantly surprised with the size of the cabin. Rooms well equipped with a decent shower and either there's never anyone else there or their soundproofing is excellent. 
It's been too cold to enjoy the balcony but the views do give a sense of space. Front office staff invariably charming. Location is very convenient for DLR.",5,2015,06,14
119,A truly special place,"There is something very seductive about a cruise, but if all you have is a short weekend there is no hope on earth that you would combine a micro seafaring experience with your available time.   

The Sunborn Yacht Hotel London is therefore the closest you could get to a luxury mini cruise without ever leaving London.   Located just a few steps away from Custom House DLR station or Royal Victoria (the latter provides a more scenic walk by the way), this big yacht is now permanently moored next to the Excel exhibition centre.  Inside is all glitz and glamour as you’d expect on board of a cruiser, with the solid heavy duty fittings of all good ships.  Our room (or should I call it cabin?) was impeccably appointed, with a king size bed, a sofa and a nice little balcony over the water (admittedly this was extra, but well worth it).  Consuming a cocktail in the bar evoked the thrill of sailing, but without leaving dry land.  As a matter of fact bar service was probably the least satisfactory aspect of the experience.  While there was no doubt that the head barman knew a thing or two about drinks the waiters moved on one gear only, very slow and indifferent.  If I have another criticism to add is that the background music made you yearn for the presence of a piano (preferably a white grand piano!) in the lobby, with a good pianist to play it, to soothe, relax the spirit and add to the atmosphere.  Who knows, maybe the management reads these reviews and may get a hint…

We had dinner in the restaurant (great views) which was fine.  Some courses were tastier than others, but in general you dine in the restaurant for the overall experience.  Service was polite and efficient, more so than the one in the bar (but not as deliciously welcoming as the Front of House - three cheers for their FoH Manager and for setting up those high standards).

All in all we’d definitely like to stay again and perhaps in our next visit we may even discover where the magic hair drier ‘on’ switch is located.",4,2015,06,14
119,Lovely,"My wife and I stayed there as we had a party in London. Our room was huge, clean and tidy. The bed was also huge and comfortable. The breakfast was really good. 
My wife had a spa treatment which she found most enjoyable.

All in all, it was a very good experience. The cost was £317 for an overnight stay and a spa. 

The staff were lovely and friendly and I couldn't fault anything.",5,2015,06,14
119,Lovely hotel and a real change from the norm,"Great room (we went executive) and riverside balcony over Thames. 2 minute walk to sky-ride into city where you can hop on a water taxi.

Lovely friendly staff and clean, very well appointed room.

Bar area is nice with outside balcony to the rear and a large selection of cocktails.

Normal cocktails £9 and champagne ones are £10.50

Well worth a stay",5,2015,06,13
119,Take that concert,"Booked this hotel because it is close to O2 .Somewhere different to stay with great staterooms.Quality at a great price.
Cable car is close by with easy access to o2,great selection of restaurants on Marina",5,2015,06,12
119,Fab views,"Stayed one night for a show at excel London. Was surprised at the size of the rooms extremely spacious with a balcony facing the river. Bathroom small but the shower lovely and powerful, with Milton Browne toiletries and big fluffy quality towels. Terraces really lovely especially with the weather being so nice. The views of Canary Wharf are spectacular day and night. The staff were top class and extremely professional. I was coughing in reception and one of the gentleman behind the desk offered me a glass of water. Nothing seemed too much trouble. Breakfast was pricy so I expected a little more but it was very good. Great location with a nice bar and restaurants close by. Would highly recommend it. I never put photos on Tripadvisor but could not resist putting up a couple!",5,2015,06,11
119,Wow wow wow! better than the Shard!,"I booked this as a birthday surprise for my boyfriend as  I thought it would be something different than the normal restaurant. Well it didn't disappoint, my only disappointment was that I hadn't booked to stay in the hotel room as well. Walking up to the boat you automatically feel special, we went up in the lift and were met by lovely staff who guided us up to Lands End Restaurant. I requested a nice table prior to arriving and on arrival it couldn't have been better a window seat overlooking the sights of London. The staff and food in the restaurant were first class and very attentive. We recently stayed and ate at the Shard and I can honestly although that was wonderful, the food and staff on the sunborn was better. We had the set menu which was unbelievable good value and the ordered a bottle of champagne. Once we finished the meal we asked if we could possibly go out on deck as it was a lovely day. Nothing was too much trouble and they set up a table for us bought the champagne to us and we overlooked the O2. This truly was a memorable stay and we will be back although next time we will also book a room. Thank-you to everyone on board who makes this a special experience",5,2015,06,10
119,Impressive but not luxury as described,"A really unusual place to stay. The rooms are big and on arrival to the main reception the chandelier is impressive.
Sadly there were no luxury touches, the bar lacked ambience and was frankly dull decor wise.
The staff were pleasant but not 4 star trained, we had to ask to be served and ask for more drinks when glasses were empty. They were oblivious.
Location is good for excel but now we've stayed I wouldnt bother again. There are much nicer hotels that are more impressive than this.
Frankly the website is not a true representation of what we got.",3,2015,06,09
119,Impressive ,"Went with a coach tour on Sunday and stayed just the one night. The room was quite large with a super king sized comfy bed couch tablet with free wifi internet connection.  The room was spacious bright airy and clean. We had a dock view berth with window overlooking the dock. It was a lovely evening so we went for a walk along the dock were plenty of people  were taking advantage of the warm and sunny evening . There are plenty of restaurants along the dock along with a few convince stores to choose from if you prefer to eat out. Breakfast was a buffet style with plenty of the usual choices including full English of course but also cereals and fruit etc. Staff were very pleasant and friendly. All in all hard to fault and we had a nice experience staying there. We went with GB Tours, the hotel was inclusive and VGVFM. ",5,2015,06,09
119,"Nice boat, lacked ambience, not much to do","Nice boat, nice rooms, not much going on though, lacked ambience, only 3 other diners, didn't excite me too much. Didn't feel like I woke up millionaire style like they say. An experience to be had, other places to go in the area.",3,2015,06,08
119,Sally and Dave,"An amazing experience, treated like royalty from the start, this hotel is top class, came here for my birthday, free upgrade and champagne cocktails , many thanks to Maryam and Egle and all the 
staff for making our stay perfect . Will definitely be coming back soon.

119,If you need to be.  At this end of London.  This it really   Nice place to stay,"  This place.   is good   Say  on night when I was working at the   Excel   Which is next door it is 25 min on the train or boat from.  Town  cheque in on line book on line.  Pay on line 
Nice rooms  nice people   Breakfast.  Was good    Not a bargin but good. ",4,2015,06,08
119,Home from Home.,"Have just experienced the most amazing two days. On a theatre trip to London I stayed at the most amazing floating hotel, The Sunborn Yacht London.
From the moment I stepped on the yacht it felt like home. The check in was quick and when I arrived at my cabin it was pure luxury. King size bed, view over the dock everything you could want. After the show came back to the yacht and had a good nights sleep. I was amazed at how quiet it was. Next morning I went passed the check in desk and was greeted by a young lady who have a smile to lit up any room. We had a little chat then I went for breakfast. Breakfast was hot and plenty. (Self Service) The view from the room was of Canary Wharf. Sadly I had to leave but will return again.
The staff were all friendly and smart. 
Would recommend this floating hotel to all. Go and enjoy the experience for yourself.",5,2015,06,07
119,Completely blown away by this place!,"If you ever fancy a romantic break in London but don't want to stay in central London then this is the place for you! You can get off the DLR at Customs House walk across the bridge to the Excel and you're there.  Stunning yacht, very friendly and helpful staff! 

I had been booked into a room with a dock view but as they were quiet Maryianne booked me into a room with a river view. 

My room was just as you come into the corridor from the lift lobby so I thought I would hear a lot of noise but I didn't hear anything all night. 

Beautiful luxurious room, with a sofa, large king size bed lovely coffee machine that used Lavazza coffe! There was a tablet in the room where you can order your evening meals and breakfast from if you didn't want to go to the dinining room. 

I had the best night's sleep, the bed was so comfortable. 

All in all a very special visit - I felt like a queen!",5,2015,06,05
119,Short break in London,"My husband and I had a great time staying on board this yacht hotel. The rooms are a good size, nice but not luxurious but a great price. The location is about half an hour by dlr and tube from Central London but it's an area of London I don't know v well so it was good to see a part of it. You can easily get to the 02 by cable car and we also took a Thames clipper down the river which was great fun. ",4,2015,06,05
119,Floating paradise,"I will start with AMAZING !!!!! We booked this trip for my birthday, and wow was I treated like a princess !!! When we arrived we were greeted by the manager who took us personally to our upgraded suite it was beautiful along with balcony, sauna and jacuzzi. Room was immaculate and clean and perfect for our romantic evening. We also received complementary cocktails by the friendly courteous staff, who couldn't do enough for us. We booked into the restaurant and were given reserved seats with amazing views over london, food was 1st class and service impeccable. After dinner we strolled across to the nearby emerates cable car (also worth a ride ) and returned to chill in the bar for the evening. We have stayed in many hotels from the 5 * grove to hilton but I can say this was by far the nicest from accommodation to staff and service.  Thank you Andreas and staff and sunborn we shall return Sharon and Colin Trotter.",5,2015,06,04
119,"Hotel with a difference, Ideal for O2!","Really enjoyable stay ""on board"" the Sunborn, great bar, extremely pleasant and helpful staff without exception, top class room on upper deck with balcony, views over London, O2, etc. Much more spacious than we expected, spotlessly clean, perfect temperature, superb enormous bed, excellent meal, (great value 3 courses inc glass champagne £30 a head), short walk to Cable Car across to O2 for Fleetwood Mac! Good nights sleep until planes started taking off from City Airport at 7 ish, if you're a light sleeper take ear plugs! All in all, a pretty much faultless experience, not cheap, but then where in London is?!!!! Would totally recommend as a luxurious, conveniently situated Hotel with a difference!",5,2015,06,04
119,Stunning!,"My husband and I stayed here as a treat/romantic break while in London for a concert at the O2.
We stayed in the Exec Suite room 4040, breathtaking!, we were treated like royalty by all staff and nothing was too much trouble. Everywhere was spotless, bedding and towels sparkling white and the extra's like complimentary wine and nibbles made it unforgetable. The bathroom in this suite with jacuzzi and sauna was a real wow factor.
Overall would really recomend this venue and we will return!",5,2015,06,04
119,Great hotel with a difference,We stayed here for 1 night as a birthday treat. The room was much nicer and larger than I expected with a good view of the river. Check in staff were very polite and helpful and the bar area was nice. In the summer I can imagine it's lovely sat outside.  Bar prices are as you'd expect for a London hotel. The trip to the O2 was fairly simple via DLR and had a wider selection of bars a restaurants than the dock. Definitely worth the splurge.,5,2015,06,03
119,Spoilt again!,Just came home from another fab stay on board Sunborn Hotel.   We celebrated our 30th wedding anniversary. They couldn't do enough for us.  Room upgraded on arrival. All the staff gave us their congratulations.  Would thoroughly recommend a stay. The restaurant is superb.  Bar meals also lovely.  Rooms spotless. Can't wait to go back again soon,5,2015,06,03

Amazing super yacht turned into a hotel (what a concept👍) I was staying here for a weekend convention at the Excel. So convenient. Nothing was too much of an ask, total flexibility & the staff been brilliant. Go & stay👍",5,2015,06,03
119,Awesome venue!,"This was a birthday surprise I had no idea where I was going and when I arrived I was blown away! We were welcomed on board as soon as we arrived and check in was swift and pleasant . Our room was very well appointed with a great coffee machine which took pods and a selection of teas. However fresh milk would have been a nice touch and there were only 3 coffee pods why an odd number? Loved the tablet great way to order breakfast and see all amenities available much better that a folder full of info. The bathroom was well appointed with lovely Molten Brown toiletries, great shower and lovely fluffy towels. Would have loved a bath but understandably it's a ship style cabin. Poor standard loo paper and tissue tho ! Drinks and snacks on the deck were lovely great service too very attentive. 
Bed was very comfortable although we were hot in the night and opened the door to the balcony to cool down.
Free wifi worked well.
All in all a fantastic stay and would love to return.",5,2015,06,02
119,Wonderful!,"Loved every minute - didn't want to leave! Felt very welcomed from the minute we arrived (I think the lady on reception was called Naz?) what a lovely genuine lady thank you for making us so welcome. Rooms were a little 90's! But this went with the ambience of the yacht. Everything was catered for -
Would love to go back - maybe we could stretch to a balcony next time!? Thanks for making my birthday weekend one to remember! ",5,2015,06,01
119,Wow!,"I booked this for my partner's birthday and we were not disappointed. Finding it is easy, right next to the Excel centre. we boarded via a lift from the dockside. Checked in, bags went to the room while we dashed off to use the Emirates cable car to the O2, which is just behind the boat.

Came back and the bags were in the room.  We had a dockside King Executive suite which was gorgeous with a balcony.

Went upstairs to the fourth floor and the restaurant and had cocktails looking out over the newly renovated docklands. 

Dinner was tremendous.

Back to the bar for cocktails, then bed. Oh what a bed, soooo comfortable!

The staff were superb, the place is spotlessly clean, I would DEFINATELY recommend.

Trust me I moan when unhappy, but this place ticked all my boxes.",5,2015,06,01
119,Comfortable,"We stayed for two nights in May. The room was large and comfortable. On Sunday evening we were advised not to use the restaurant as the kitchen was very busy with an event. In the end we had an average bar meal. 
Parking is remote and incredibly you cannot even drive up to the boat to drop off your luggage. In the rain this is a real pain and needs to be addressed.",4,2015,06,01
119,Amazing.,We stayed at this amazing floating hotel as a special occasion. Located right by The Excel centre in London Docklands this is worth a stay. Luxury throughout. A lift takes you up to the wonderful reception area where we were greeted  by a polite and helpful member of staff. We had a room which overlooked the dock and we had a balcony. To the left was London City airport and to the right was Canary Wharf and the O2. Great view. The room was spacious and had a king sized bed a 2 seater sofa flat screened tv fridge tea coffee and bottled water. Bathrobes and slippers also supplied. Decent sized toilet and shower. A digital tablet by your bed to use for information about the hotel and area instead of the usual folder. Air con in room.,5,2015,05,31
119,"Beautiful, helpful and friendly staff!","When I arrived there was some booking issues caused by the agents we booked the hotel through, the reception was happy to help! They made sure all my guests had a room and gave myself an executive room with free drinks. All the staff was friendly and extremely helpful. I enjoyed talking with the receptionists, having a drink in the lounge and the breakfast was thoroughly enjoyable. The price was about right for the time of year we stayed (the same weekend as London MCM Comic Con). In total I had 8 of my staff staying in the hotel and every single one of them remarked it was one of the nicest places they had stayed. I would completely recommend this hotel! If any of the staff are reading this who dealt with my situation and remember me, thank you very much for all your help!",5,2015,05,31
119,Beautiful ,"Stayed as a trip to the O2, perfect position to use the cable cars. The staff were really friendly on reception. The boat was beautiful. The rooms were to a nice standard and I slept brilliantly. Nice views of the Thames. Would recommend to anyone. ",5,2015,05,30
119,"Save your money, it's terrible! ","Just one word of advice if you are thinking of visiting this awful place and that's DON'T! The room we were given was dirty, had unusable plug sockets, no wifi and no heating. When we asked for help we were advised to open the curtains and give the (cold) radiator half an hour to try and take the chill off. After approaching management to try to discuss our issues we were fobbed off with an offer of an upgrade when we visited again. AS IF WE WOULD BOTHER!",1,2015,05,29
119,Another memorable visit!!,"After our last visit in January, my wife and I decided to book again but this time we took our 2 children (6 and 4 years old) and my In-Laws. When we arrived we were upgraded to a River View room, which was a great start! One of the great things about this hotel is that kids go free- including breakfast! When we got to our room, we discovered that the sofa bed was not made up so I put it together and I called reception to organise extra bedding. I was told that I did not have to do this as this would all be sorted nearer the time that the bed was going to be used. I thought this was a great touch! We had lunch in the bar (which I will review later) and then went out for the day. When we came back, the sofa bed was made up when we needed it.

The location is fantastic to get into London by train or even the Thames Clipper. I highly recommend this hotel if you are looking to take the family out in London and want to stay over!!",5,2015,05,28
119,Ahoy there! ,"As a business traveller with a reasonable expenses allowance you are always looking for a bargain when staying in London. So when the opportunity to stay at this unique hotel for £80.00 came up I didn't need to think twice. 

The boat is on a permanent mooring so there's no sea experience as such but you can't help looking forward to climbing aboard! 

It's all very shiney and high end attention by the staff, but what's really nice is the very well appointed and comfortable bedroom, which I believe was the standard offering. 

Nice king size bed, espresso coffee machine, Moulton Brown toiletries, 2 bottles of water! are all included in the price. 

I didn't eat there or visit the bar and £20.00 for the breakfast meant that I looked elsewhere in the morning for food before I headed for the DLR. 

Would definitely like to stay there again at that price and would happily pay more (I paid £120.00 to stay in the Ibis across the square the following week!) for the quality and comfort. ",4,2015,05,27
119,Wonderfull stay whilst in London with the Kids,"Stayed here on Bank Holiday Monday for the night. We arrived at around 1pm but were unable to check in til at least 3pm. The lady on reception (Mital - I think) was very professional and advised that they would look after the luggage and advised us of the best way to spend the time locally. We arrived back at 8pm to find the luggage already set up in our room. Nice Touch..

We had to wait for the bed to be set up for the kids but this was not a problem and the house keeping lady again was a lot of fun and even gave some extra hot chocolate for the little ones. 

Strange places to eat outside of the hotel, a mix of a bad India, a closed Italian and a  Lebanese and Chinese place. non had particularly high tripadvisor grades so we ended up at the Fox pub/resturant next door to the India. You cannot see this from the hotel and so worth a look as good value for money and decent food. 

Also a Tesco and a takeaway pizza place near by.

Cable Cars are worth doing, and the DLR to Tower Gateway is the chepest and quickest method to get to central in my opinion. either from the Excel or from Royal Victoria both a five min walk.

15 to park for 24 hours at Royal Victoria in fine but you can only buy in increments of 24 hours and so if you stay for 25 hours you are paying 30 be warned. We stayed for 24 and then moved the car over to the 02 where you can pay by the hour whilst staying there. 

Greek guy on reception when we left was very pleasant and set us on our way with a smile. 

They ask for a 40 deposit for extra's which seemed strange but then it was put straight back on when we left. wasted a bit of time in my opinion but there must be a reason for this. 

Only poor thing with the hotel is that the rooms are really hot, and I mean really hot. We left the air con on all night and still struggled to sleep comfortably. 

Also the noise from the City Airport near by couldupset some people as we are right under the flight path. It had stopped by the time we got back to the room but was back on again at around 8am. 

All in all a good stay and takes the hussle and bussle out of london. Breakfast 20 per person was too rich for us and it looked pretty standard. 

I would recommend and will return..",4,2015,05,27
119,Great hotel in a quiet location,"I got a great deal for this hotel as a base for a couple of days in London for my teenage son and I. It's fun to stay somewhere quirky once in a while and an ex cruise ship permanently moored in Victoria Docks seemed as good as any. The staff were friendly and the room was spacious. Sofa, large beds and plenty of storage. It was really quiet although it's a metal building so be prepared for the odd echo of doors etc. Our room ticked the right boxes - comfy bed, not too hot or too cool, powerful shower in a clean bathroom and clean and tidy. We didn't use the restaurant but the bar was nice sitting outside ""on deck"" looking across the water towards the cable cars, the O2 and Canary Wharf. Bar prices weren't too bad, on a par with London prices. Location wise, there was nothing on at Excel so the piazza was quieter than I imagine it normally is but the whole area is fairly relaxed. The cable cars to the Greenwich peninsula are next door and the DLR is 5 mins walk.

If you're not desperate to be right in central London this provides a quitter alternative.",4,2015,05,27
119,By cable car to stay on a yacht!,"So it's not cheap but it is special and surely that's what wedding anniversaries are for? The Sunborn is moored in Victoria Dock just outside the main entrance to the Excel exhibition centre which isn't everyone's idea of a romantic location but at night there is something magical about being near the water and it's nicely lit with a few restaurants if you want to go out. 

We traveled via Canada Water on the Jubilee Line (had to be a water theme) and alighted at North Greenwich to catch the Emirates Air Line cable car which is really the only way to arrive in style. The views across London are stunning and you get your first glimpse of the boat from the air which is great. It's then a short stroll along the quayside to the boat. Alternatively, you could catch the DLR to Custom House which is cheaper but far less scenic. 

Reception is on the third floor and is a glass and chrome confection befitting a seagoing vessel. There is a lift at the entrance which is controlled by your room card - without it you can only get to the public areas. The staff throughout our stay were friendly and attentive without being intrusive. You felt that they genuinely wanted you to have a good time and that applied to all staff including the cleaners. 

We had a King Room which had a huge and very comfortable bed. There was a smallish bathroom which is what you'd expect on a boat! Excellent shower though. We ate in the restaurant which was very good as was breakfast the following morning.

After we'd dropped off our bags on day one we headed off to Greenwich on the DLR; on the second day we found Thames Barrier Park about half a mile away which is also worth visiting. 

Overall a very memorable stay and highly recommended but both room and food are expensive. That said, we felt that we got what we paid for - not always the case!",5,2015,05,26
119,Perfect 24 hours,"Booked a river view and when we arrived they upgraded us to a executive riverview and could not do enough to help us settle in. 
 Dinner was really appetising and the surroundings beautiful it was really nice to sit at the window and watch the thames go by and the gondolas from the river crossing at the 02 building . 
 The accommodation roomy to say the least and it was lovely to finish the day with a
drink in the bar and a coffee on our balcony Our bed was really comfy.
 Breakfast was very tasty and the staff were so helpful.
 When it came to check-out the reception staff were so good all in all a great break 
 never to be forgotten . Sorry to be so late with this review but have been ill. 

 Pat.",5,2015,05,26
119,Amazing,"Wonderful, can't say enough good things, reception/booking in was so professional, room was amazing, view lovely, will certainly be returning.  Ideal for O2 and other exhibition centre, cable cars very short walk away!  Really good location for business or pleasure.",5,2015,05,26
119,fantastic location & facilities and great value for money,"Booked this hotel due to its fantastic location, literally outside of the Excel centre.  Stayed with my 9 yr old son and my mother so booked a family room.  Great facilities, room was of a good standard and clean,  with very comfortable beds etc.
Ate in the bar, food was good quality and reasonably priced, good selection of cocktails etc on the drinks menu, a little pricey but not as high as some other london hotels.  all in all a great stay",5,2015,05,26
119,Stunning,"Spoilt with great service & amazing views. Staff were very helpful & friendly, upgraded room from dock view to river view free of charge & complimentary late check out given too. Would thoroughly recommend & will definately return. Book through booking.com for best rates.",5,2015,05,26
119,great please for afternoon tea,"my friend and I went here for  afternoon tea 
and love  it  was well worth the visit  and the  staff was so welcoming  and   nothing was a problem for them  .

and please go and vist the hotel rooms a  so nice I wouild love to stay but was a bit out of my  budget",5,2015,05,25
119,excellent,"the staff are very helpful and friendly as soon as you board this luxurious yacht hotel.  i could not fault this accommodation in any way.
Food looked a bit expensive compared to local restaurants and we chose not to eat here and therefore cannot comment on its quality. That said, for the ambience one would expect prices to be higher, the setting is great and the terrace from the bar a superb place to spend an evening.",5,2015,05,25
119,"Luxurious, Spacious, Peaceful in the middle of London","We booked two nights and were just happy with the novelty of the accommodation and the expected surroundings. On arrival we were delighted with the standard of the hotel and even more so when we were given an upgrade on the waterside. I had thought it might be a bit fake and over the top without substance. Just more fun than dignity. I was wrong, there was a feeling of quality throughout. From the thickest, fluffiest towels and the heated floor in the bathroom to the deep pike luxurious carpet. The beds were very comfortable, and all room facilities were excellent. 
The staff we met were charming. We are absolutely looking for an excuse to go back again. The restaurant was not to the same standard but that would not put me off going back, We went for the set menu and had a few problems which could have been handled better. It wasn't bad it just wasn't in line with the rest of the place. 
Next time I hope to make full use of the spa too. ",4,2015,05,24
119,Very nice hotel,"Lovely hotel and just a nice change something different than your normal 4 solid walled hotel firmly on the ground, it has lovely views of the river and breakfast in the restaurant has the most amazing views, the hotel is very luxurious how every the cleaners might be overlooking the dusting! Found quite a bit of dust through the room
Would stay again",4,2015,05,24
119,Went for business but it was a pleasure.,A great location only a few minutes from Royal Victoria station and the cable car.  The area has a large number and variety of restaurants.The yacht hotel looks very impressive as you arrive and that continues with the décor inside.  Reception service was very good and the rooms were of a very high standard.  The bar is very popular with residents and non residents alike and if you're lucky enough to get good weather then take advantage and enjoy your drinks on the upper deck in the fresh air and admire the beautiful views of that part of London.,4,2015,05,23
119,"Fabulous welcome, even better experience...","An amazing an unique hotel in the heart of London's Docklands, perfect for a treat or a visit to the O2 etc. A fantastic welcome by all the staff and brilliant treatment from the moment we arrived till the moment we left.  Rooms in excellent condition and far outweigh anything Ive stayed in before.
We will be going back....",5,2015,05,23
119,Superb Hotel Maryiam and Peter made our Wedding Anniversary Amazing,"Superb Hotel, Loved our room which was decorated with excellence. The dinner was amazing our ""star"" waiter Peter made the evening so memorable. I Definitely recommend and I will be returning with my family for my big 40 celebration!",5,2015,05,22
119,"Lovely hotel, good location for O2","My friend and I stayed here to go to a concert at the O2 and it was a perfect location. Just a 5 minute walk to the emirate skyline which takes you straight to the O2. It's right by custom house DLR. And you can park again the excel centre too. The hotel itself is really nice. Restaurants are overpriced but the food is really good, service is outstanding and our room was lovely, big and clean. I would definitely stay here again",5,2015,05,22
119,Cool...,"Nice location, amazingly large room for a boat... a REAL Hotel!

Not cheap but on THAT particular day during the Chelsea flower exhibition, probably one of the best value for money and so different.

Personnel is really attentive to details and the boat is in pretty good condition.

On a ""normal"" day, if the offer is reasonable... I will come back.",4,2015,05,22
119,Great place but cold and uncomfortable ,"We hired the yacht for a company event and to stay on while we worked at a nearby exhibition in the Excel Centre. The reception of this place is interesting as you have to use the lift to gain access to level 3 and then are presented with a traditional elegant staircase with circular reception and bar behind. Staff are friendly enough and sorted our booking, but I have to state slowly as with the process of everything in this place. We had executive rooms with balconies, which on the face of things sounds great, our original room faced out into the Thames and all seemed good. However the entire yacht suffers from poor air conditioning that seems uncontrollable and our first bedroom had a unit that decided to make a squealing noise which at 2am was unable to be fixed and therefore we had to change rooms, which was a trauma! The second room was better, air con still rumbled and the view was now of the excel centre. Maybe due to the bad start my experience suffered, but spending 4 nights on here was not comfortable and something I shall not book in the future. Furthermore the restaurant and bar areas suffered the same issue with air con, with many guests complaining about the cold which made for an uneasy atmosphere. Breakfast was OK, nice selection and fresh. On the positive side we did hire the fifth deck room for an event and this was certainly a success, great venue and with over 200+ guests the atmosphere was excellent, along with the support of the staff on that particular night. Checking out was a bit of a palaver, until the manager took control.  Sorry to say I will not book again. ",3,2015,05,21
119,Great Hotel,"Stayed here for four nights, great location within easy walking distance of Custom House DLR. The hotel is near to the Excel Exhibition Centre so there are plenty of places to eat and things to do within a short walking distance from this hotel.

The hotel itself is luxurious, the rooms are big and comfortable, they are clean and tidy with all the amenities you would expect in a hotel of this class.

The hotel staff were helpful, courteous and welcoming and couldn't do enough for us.

The hotel restaurant serves excellent food and if you choose the set menu, which has a good selection of dishes and choices, it also represents good value at £41 per head for three courses, including a glass of champagne.

The only small problem we had was there is a private function room above the restaurant, when visited for a meal there was a child's party booked in this room which was quite noisy and disruptive, it didn't bother us but I think other diners may not have not appreciated the disruption to their meal.

There was also a small mistake on my bill but this was easily corrected and the staff were very apologetic and embarrassed this had occurred.

In conclusion, I whole heartedly recommend this hotel, we will definitely consider staying again if decide to take a London City break in the future.",5,2015,05,21
119,One of the best ,"I booked a night on the Sunborn for my girlfriend and myself. Firstly, the yacht is stunning. Reception, the deck, the bar and restaurant. All are very smart indeed. We were immediately upgraded to an executive room upon check in as we were celebrating. Maryiam looked after us very well. I planned champagne in the room for a certain time which she arranged for me. Also assisted with my girlfriends treatment in the spa, which I'm told was also very good. 

The room was really spacious and the balcony had a great view of the river. Everything about our stay here was perfected. Great value for money, fantastic staff and a very cool place to stay. We will be back!!",5,2015,05,21
119,Amazing food,"My partner and I were staying at the nearby Ibis hotel and decided to go to the Sunborn for dinner as it was the best looking restaurant locally that we could find. It didn't disappoint. Only downside was that online they advertised a set menu at a very reasonable price but when we arrived this menu didn't exist so our meal cost more than we expected. 

The restuarant entrance was via a lift and then some stairs. The staff were very polite and friendly. We were shown to our table and napkins placed on our laps. 

We ordered drinks and were given a basket of small and exceptionally tasty bread rolls. They each had a different flavour: olive, sun dried tomato, white and wholemeal. 

There was only a handful of dishes to choose from on the menu. We both chose the belly pork with crackling. It was delicious but would have been better had there been some vegetables on the side. 

For dessert we chose cheesecake. Again it was small but delicious. 

The view from the ship was lovely with the O2 all lit up. 

There was a bit of a problem paying as the card machines kept doubling the bill but the waitress was very apologetic. 

All in all I would go back again but would have been happier had the advertised menu been available. ",4,2015,05,19
119,The hotel with a big difference,My husband and I visited the Sunborn last weekend to celebrate our wedding anniversary. Nothing was too much trouble for the staff and whilst checking in the staff answered our questions about the yacht and made us feel very welcome taking time out to have a giggle with us.  The rooms were fabulous not only the decor but they were spacious and very welcoming.  The location of the hotel was fabulous and it was nice to be out of the hustle and bustle of the city centre.  We had breakfast at the hotel on both mornings in the restaurant and not only was it of a high standard but the view was a bonus as well.  We have stayed at so many places in London but not one has come close to the experience we had at Sunborn. We will most definitely return in the near future. Thank you for making our stay memorable for our 16 year anniversary.  Julie and Richard Dodd,5,2015,05,19
119,Truly amazing .,"Absolutely faultless and special mentions for Marco our waiter for dinner and of course the the very special Sandra on reception who made us feel special. It just takes a smile and a kind word to make you feel at home . 
This is an experience that every-one should try . Comfy bed and powerful hot shower in immaculate rooms with a wow factor .  Breakfast was relaxed and the food was excellent with a view thrown in . We had the advantage of being on the fourth floor which made dinner and breakfast so close and easy . Sorry to leave and this company have certainly got it right .",5,2015,05,19
119,That extra bit special!,"I've stayed at the Sunborn London for two nights as I was running in the London Marathon and location wise it seemed ideal as it was fairly close to the starting point of the marathon. Although it turns out that it's easy to get to anywhere in London from there as the tube station is only 2 minutes away.
I was pleasantly surprised by the authentic feel that Sunborn London had. You had the feeling that you were on a cruise ship and it felt that extra bit special and not just being in a hotel. I had a deluxe king size room and it was very spacious and well equipped. I would recommend having cocktails in the hotel bar as you get a pleasant view of the dock.
There are a few nice restaurants near by. The Italian restaurant opposite the yacht was particularly nice.
I would definitely stay here again if I would have the opportunity!",5,2015,05,18
119,Amazing hotel,"Only stayed one night, a wonderful experience, large very well cabins and very comfortable. Only one downside the evening menu very limited. breakfast excellent.
The hotel in a very good position for The Dome Excel and the light railway for  transport into the city",4,2015,05,18
119,Absolutely Brilliant Hotel,"My business partner and I stayed at this Hotel as we had an exhibition to attend at the neighbouring ExCel Centre. We each stayed in the Classic River View rooms. My business partner's room was towards the front of the Yacht whereas my room was situated towards the rear of the Yacht. 

Although the decor of the rooms was identical (except that his room had a wooden floor and my floor was carpeted), my room was significantly bigger, so if you have the option, I would suggest you ask for a room towards the rear of the Yacht. 

The staff were very helpful throughout even though the Hotel was fully booked when we visited. 

The room was spotless and the inclusion of a tablet next to your bed was a great touch.

We didn't eat at the Hotel, so can't comment.

The only downside was that the Hotel did not have its own parking. However, this can be relatively easily remedied by using the Excel Centre parking or using the parking of the Novotel next door.

My business partner and I have both stayed at a lot of hotels over the years and we both commented upon how this was definitely one of the best.

I am not sure how it compares price wise to some of the branded hotels nearby but for me, i would happily pay a little extra for the luxury and novelty of staying here.",5,2015,05,18
119,Overwhelmed by the whole experience !!!!!,"I cannot express enough what a fantastic hotel this is ... you have to stay to appreciate the absolutely fabulous service and facilities...

119,Brilliant hotel experience,"We stayed at the Sunborn london to celebrate my partners birthday. I  arrival we were very impressed with the decor and luxury of the yacht . At check in we were in a queue  (only one couple in front) and due to the short wait we were given complimentary drinks from Romao. .. who was such a lovely man. 
All staff we encountered were polite and friendly. Our room was amazing. We were on level 2. Beautiful large room with lovely view on river. We popped over to the o2 on the cable cars for evening dinner so cannot comment on the restaurant.  We did enjoy a cocktail in the bar and sat on the open decking with the view or the o2 and cable cars etc. Lovely evening.  We decided while we were there to book for this new years eve. As we thoroughly enjoyed our stay. There is nothing we can say that was bad or dissapointing. Luxury is the word that emulates this experience. And we cannot wait to go again.",5,2015,05,17

On arrival we were blown away with the decoration and ambiance of this yacht. 
Nazaam on reception was extremely accommodating and couldn't have helped enough. 
The room was spectacular and didn't expect such amazing quality....tablet in the room,  huge bed, coffee machine and everything was sparkling clean.
Views were amazing and especially at night.
Delicious cocktails...a little on the expensive side but so worth it. We didn't eat so can't comment on that. 
Staff very accommodating and welcoming.
We will absolutely be returning soon as this was a unique and very special hotel to find....Thankyou",5,2015,05,13

Extra thanks to Cloudio and Ramon. We have already  booked to stay again in July. Perfect for Excel Center and close to O2,5,2015,05,12
119,Swansalona ,"Well where do I start, fantastic venue, staff, food ect ect ect. Can't speak highly enough of this hotel, we relaxed and thoroughly enjoyed ourselves. I will be telling everyone we know about it and I recommend it to anybody. There is only one place to come when visiting London and that is The Sunborn Hotel. ",5,2015,05,12
119,Anniversary visit made extra special.,"Just arrived back from a wonderful weekend at the Sunborn Yacht Hotel in London . This impressive hotel is all you would need for that special occasion or any visit. On arrival staff were very attentive, polite and welcoming. The rooms were of a very high standard . The yacht was outstanding in everyway. Food and drink were excellent . Special thanks to the duty manager Manolo . He was lovely nothing too much trouble. I would highly recommend staying at this hotel I'm looking forward to my next visit already. Special thanks to all the staff you're a credit to your company thank you ",5,2015,05,11
119,Wow - Just Wow!,"I made the last minute decision to stay close to the ExCel conference centre for a business event and found this fantastic superyacht hotel! As a recreational sailor, this was the perfect option for me and to be frank, it knocked the socks off the hotels on the dock beside us - not only in price, but also from the originality of being on a fabulous boat for the night. 

The views over the Dome and Canary Wharf are breathtaking, the rooms are superb (even the classic rooms are big enough for a party) and the food in the restaurant is to die for. Service is impeccable, so all in all, a gem of a find. 

I stay in a lot of hotels globally - this one is definitely in my top 5!!! I shall be staying again and I've already told all my friends!",5,2015,05,11
119,I felt like royalty!,"I attended a trade show at Excel and chose the Sunborn because of its proximity to the convention center. I was a bit anxious about staying on a ""Yacht Hotel"" as I didn't know what to expect. I was very pleasantly surprised with absolutely everything I experienced during my visit. The lounge was lovely with views of the water and the city that were just incredible! My room was spacious, clean and had another incredible view of the water with a small balcony. The attention to detail was impeccable, not only in my room but with every space in the hotel. The staff couldn't have been nicer. Truly an incredible experience!",5,2015,05,11
119,great time,"What a fantastic hotel, rooms were lovely very spacious, had a king executive , arrived for the afternoon tea which seemed to take a while to bring out looked very nice when did arrive but for £22 pp there didn't seem to be a lot for your money, they asked if we wanted water but forgot to say it wasn't included so ended up paying extra also seem to be lots of extra charges here & there ! The staff are very nice & polite couldn't be more helpful, but we enjoyed our stay they just need to be a little quicker in bringing things to you ie drinks, but we all had a fab time would love to back again some day.",4,2015,05,10
119,"Lovely hotel, needs more staff, service charges galore!","We booked one night at the sunborn for a hen party, and afternoon tea. The hotel is beautiful, very clean and a short walk from the train station so easy to find.
On arrival we went to the bar and ordered cocktails, which we waited almost half an hour for, and when they did arrive, the waiter didn't know what any of them were! Nevertheless the cocktails were very well made, and we enjoyed them.
We then went up for afternoon tea. The menus were handed out despite the food served being non optional, so we could remind ourselves of what we'd be having. However,not one of the cakes bought out were what was on the menu, so this seemed a little pointless. Our waitress took orders for tea, coffee and asked if we wanted water for the table, we said yes. Tea arrived quite a long time later, with no milk which we eventually had to ask for and wait even longer for. The food was very nicely presented and tasted lovely.on paying the bill, we had a large service charge, as well as being charged for our water which surprised us. The waitress said she did specify still, sparkling or tap, but we are sure she didn't. 
When we arrived in our room, we were disappointed with the view. On the website it showed the type of room we had booked with a view over the river to the o2. Instead, we were looking at the hotel opposite. We queried this with reception and were told that the website had put the wrong picture up. No apology was offered. However our room was lovely, very clean, the bathroom was also very clean and the shower was lovely. 
We then went back to the bar and had to wait for almost an hour for 3 glasses of wine! We askedvseveral times and were told it was coming but it never did. Eventually a member of staff arrived with the wine and told us there would be no charge. However it was still added to our bill and we had to ask for it to be removed. It is also worth mentioning that if you are invited to sit and have your drinks bought to you, not only will it take forever but you'll also be hit with a service charge! We weren't particularly happy about that since the service wasn't great, but paid up.
Breakfast in the morning was much the same, beautifully prepared buffet style breakfast of a very high quality, but a long wait for tea and coffee and again, no milk! 

Overall our stay was enjoyable and we had a very good time, it was just the service from staff that let it down. They were all extremely polite and willing to help, there just needed to be at least twice the number of staff to cope, I suspect. Although this would probably cause the hefty service charges to rise considerably! I would stay again, but would find other places to eat and drink.",3,2015,05,10
119,Great room and views of canary wharf,"Room large and comfortable, was overlooking entrance, would have preferred to overlook water but not a problem for a short stay. Bar has great views of canary wharf and the O2 but is a little pricy. Great coffee machine in room! Very nice stay in an unusual hotel",4,2015,05,10
119,M,I had a great stay at yacht which was a very clean and comfortable. The staff espicially Bilal were very friendly and looked after me well and was ensuring I have a enjoyable stay very happy and would defernantly be going back.,4,2015,05,09
119,Luxury indeed,"We stayed on the Sunborn yacht on 3rd May with a group from GB tours coaches.  This was our anniversary treat.  And we were treated to a fantastic overnight stay.  Our suite was enormous.  So quiet, didn't hear a sound and slept well that evening. Coffee machine, Molton Brown toiletries, and complimentary water which is unusual, other hotels charge for this.  And the staff were so kind and friendly.  We chose to eat in the Restaurant as it was a special occasion.  The food was divine, beautifully presented and tasted delicious.  We chose the three course meal which included a glass of champagne at a cost of £29.00 per person.  Superb and great value for money.    Our breakfast was buffet style, either selection of full English or continental.  We were seated looking over the huge buildings well known in London, The 'Gherkin' The Shard, the 'Cheesegrater' and 02 arena.  Claudio spent a while telling us about their plans for the future and was happy to answer any questions.  And the prices won't break the bank!!!  Thank you to all the staff for a wonderful experience.  We have already passed our experience to friends and family.  Will certainly return.",5,2015,05,08
119,Planning the next trip already!,"My experience at the Sunborn was fantastic! We stayed in a beautiful executive room with a balcony overlooking the river. The receptionist  Maryann was friendly and helpful! We enjoyed some fantastic cocktails in the bar, the staff were exceptional, especially Norbert! Breakfast was delicious with a wide variety! Great value for money and well worth the journey from Central London!",5,2015,05,08
119,Delightful,We had a fabulous overnight stay here last summer. The room was very comfortable and spacious. Real coffee machine was a bonus. Evening meal in the restaurant was excellent as was the service. Worth a visit!,5,2015,05,07
119,Almost Great,"We stayed here on a bank holiday weekend and the place was full, but almost the only place that showed this was the bar, which would have still been OK if it had not been so windy and the deck been nice to sit out on. I said almost as the other place was the restaurant, to be exact the Kitchens. Where I think there must have been a few chefs absent as all orders were delayed and the food was just about OK. It seemed that each part of a meal was prepared well, but not the whole meal. For example, we have great oysters, but had to request enough onions and wait 10 minutes for tabasco. I had a dinner of belly pork, which was brilliant, but the braised carrot was in fact a cold puree on the bottom of the plate, the mash potatoes we ordered arrived 5 minutes after the main plate and were lukewarm with a slight crust. The waiters and managers were very sorry and reduced the bill but I would have rather paid more for better.
I hope that this was just a temporary issue as the place was great and Joanne in the Spa provided my wife with one of the best massages she has had.
So would I stay again? mmm Not sure. no one owned up to there being an issue but our bill was about £200 less than it should have been due to them.
Final note, If you go the differences in cabins is ONLY the balcony so save your money and get a £95 cabin (as our frends did), rather than a £185 one with a balcony (and as our balcony door wouldn't open I was 'miffed')",3,2015,05,07
119,Fabulous Darling,"We had an over night stay in preparation for the grand designs exhibition in excel,what a fantastic surprise.The Sunborn is mighty impressive,our suite was wonderful and such a change from the normal London accommodation the sense of space is something unique.We had cocktails ,dinner all with great service,a definite thumbs up.Our only low point was breakfast we ordered room service on the i-pad in the suite it came looked great but was completely cold ,apologies were made by food and beverage manager but time was against us and we had to check out .",4,2015,05,07
119,Best nights hotel sleep in a long time,"Normally in a hotel I don't sleep so well. THings such as people in the corridor, lifts, traffic, strange bed etc. But none of that here. Huge room, nicely decorated. Coffee machine, Tablet by bed. Super comfy bed, Dock on one side and dockside without traffic on the other so very quiet. Didn't hear a thing all night, except the murmur of the aircon, which I tried to turn off but it seemed off already according to the panel.
Breakfast was £12.50 at the weekend (I think £19 ish during the week), was a hot and cold buffet and at 08:30 had plenty to eat. Only 'factory' type bread for toasting, no bread rolls or more artisan type bread. Slow Dualit toasters meant a queue for toast, and black results when people set for 4 or 5 mins... Hot food was nothing special  - eggs and bacon overcooked. Relatives staying in another room said dinner was not so good - just okay. I would recommend the room unreservedly, but for food such as breakfast I would try elsewhere. On the quay nearby, towards the Cable car (emirates air?) was a cafe which was busy with people having breakfast, but didn't try it.
Very friendly service at the desk.",5,2015,05,06
119,Outstanding,"On word describes this hotel perfectly ""outstanding"" The staff are wonderful, the rooms are spacious and luxurious, and the food is a delight. All in all 100%, I've nothing more to add other than I shall be back.",5,2015,05,06
119,"Impressive large room, great for Excel","We wanted a room near the Excel just for one night and we saw very positive reviews for Sunborn.  We got the room for a reduced price - £95 for a night.  The reviews were right - met with very good customer service - we booked a dockside room but they upgraded us to a river view room.  The room itself was clean and extremely large, especially for a London hotel room. The theme of the whole ship is quite nineteen nineties, orangey wood and gold light fittings - not modern or contemporary but very clean and very well looked after. We didn't use the bar or restaurant.  Molton Brown toiletries in the bathroom, good shower.  It was lovely to have such a spacious room, would definitely stay again!",5,2015,05,05
119,what a find,an unusual find .far better than the average london hotel.first class accomodation.if you require  luxury this is the place to stay.within easy reach of the underground system get a 4 day ticket to cover all the zones.beautiful huge rooms .get it booked if you can,5,2015,05,05
119,Disappointing stay,"After reading numerous great reviews, we were looking forward to our stay over the bank holiday weekend.

Then positives are the room is a great size for a London hotel room, with added touches of a iPad in the room, Lavazza coffee machine and Molton Brown toiletries.

The first problem occurred on the first night. The thermostat read at 25 degrees all night despite the 'air conditioning' being set to 16 degrees and on full power. No matter what temperature the thermostat was set, the room never dropped below 24.5. Considering the room has no opening windows, it made sleep unbearable. 
We contacted reception in the morning and were told it was our fault the room was so hot as we hadn't used the air conditioning correctly. Despite us arguing that yes we had and the room was unbearable, nothing was done to rectify this situation and we had to sleep in a unbelievable hot and stuffy room the next night.

The next problem came the following morning for breakfast. Breakfast is £12.50 at the weekend which seems a good deal in London. We arrived at 09.30 (breakfast is open until 11am). 
We turned out to have paid £12.50 per person for a cup of coffee and slice of toast as when we tried to get food, the hot buffet was out of EVERYTHING except grilled tomatoes. Occasional food was brought out but the staff in the 60 minutes we were sat there but only enough to serve 2-3 people. Other parts of the breakfast (indicated by the signs as the areas were completely bare) were the juices, pastries, cereal and cold meats/cheese however no more food was brought out. We heard two separate families complain to the manager and demand a refund as no food was available apart from toast.
Staff seemed completely unaware of what was happening around them and at one point, 4 members of staff were clearing tables and seating new guests despite there being no food available to eat. 

Whilst it was a novelty staying on a yacht in London, we wouldn't hurry back. There are hundreds of hotels available for the same/cheaper price and I would rather have a basic room which you can sleep in than a warm room with an iPad to use because you can't sleep in because of the heat!
If you are staying, it would be worth spending more on an executive room for some fresh air and definitely don't waste money on breakfast as it'll be the most expensive cup of coffee you buy!",2,2015,05,05
119,Wonderful luxury stay,"My wife and i stayed at the Sunborn for a night to celebrate our anniversary.
Check in was a little long winded as the staff tried to charge us for the room despite it being pre paid but the staff were very nice and sorted it out in the end.
We stayed in one of the cheaper rooms but i have to say it was fantastic. Luxurious, spacious, spotlessly clean and very quiet and peaceful. Big TV, Minibar and a tablet to use.
I have not stayed in many better rooms. The only negatives of the room were you couldn't control the A/C and it was little warm in the night. Also i could log on to the free wifi but it failed almost straight away. Neither were serious issues for me.
The yacht is in a great location for the Excel and the O2 and a short distance from the city.

The reason i have only given 4 stars was due to the breakfast. We got down to breakfast at about 9.30 and after being seated went to get some food and was amazed to see no cereal left, no fruit left. No bread for toast, almost all the pastries gone and no glasses for juice. This is a breakfast that costs £25 for a couple so you expect a bit of choice!
There was a small queue for hot food but it wasn't moving. People were waiting for the hot food to be topped up. Some people had dished up some of their breakfast but were waiting for the rest of it! Items were being re-stocked but very slowly and not in enough quantity and as soon as it was brought out it was gone again. My wife heard someone saying it was because of all the room service orders and the kitchens just couldn't cope.
We waited for about 10 mins and when we reached the front we were lucky we could get everything we wanted and i have to say it was very nice and tasty.
In fairness to the hotel, when we mentioned this on check out they said they would not charge us for the breakfast. I think they did this for a lot of people that day!
Overall we had a great stay and i would certainly come back.",4,2015,05,05
119,Lovely venue but a little noisy,"I stayed here with a friend as it was very easy to get to a concert at the O2. 

The boat is stunning and the service is excellent. We were upgraded to a room with a balcony overlooking the river. The rooms have all mod cons including Molton Brown. 

The bar is impressive and the cocktails great. We didn't eat but the food looked very nice. 

The only downside was noise. The inner doors of the boat (including one very near our cabin) slam which meant there was lots of noise the minute people starting getting up for breakfast (which was from 6.30am - and much earlier than I wanted to get up). 

It's also on the final descent for planes landing at City airport which was noisy too. 

I would stay again but find a cabin away from noisy doors. ",3,2015,05,05
119,Awesome. Loved it!,"Oh wow! Loved it, loved it, loved it. The Sunborn is a lovely floating hotel, moored to the docks next to the Exel. We arrived at midday and parked in the Excel which offers 24-hour parking for £15 and has a 24-hour security team with CCTV.  It’s a short stroll to the Sunborn and we took the lift from the dock side to a gorgeous, spacious, comfortable and clean reception area to book in. We thought that our room wouldn't be ready until later that afternoon, however, it was and we booked in there and then. The reception team were really friendly and welcoming and Maryiam, one of the team, answered any questions that we had and gave us tickets for half price cocktails at the Sunborn bar. Booking in was smooth and took minutes. The rooms are gorgeous; very spacious with a large bed and a good sized en suite with a shower. The room had complimentary robes and slippers, a mini bar and tea and coffee making facilities. Everything, and I mean everything, is of a high standard. Our room was on the river side of the hotel and had a fantastic view of the Emirates Air Line, the O2 and the City. It’s a short walk to the Emirates Air Line to go over to the O2 and get the tube into town. In the evening, we very much enjoyed the cocktails in the Sunborn bar and then went over to one of the bars and restaurants opposite the hotel. Dress code I would say is smart, casual for the evenings. After a good nights sleep, we went down to the restaurant and received a warm welcome. We were seated and enjoyed an all you can eat breakfast for £12.50 per person, choosing from tea, coffee, orange juice, yoghurt, pastries, cereal and/or a cooked breakfast including omelette. Nothing was too much trouble. The location of the Sunborn is great as it’s so close to everything but not slap bang in the middle. It also has a spa which we will book into next time. We will definitely visit the Sunborm again. We thoroughly enjoyed ourselves and it was a real treat.",5,2015,05,05
119,Perfect luxury family weekend,"Booked this for a Bank holiday away with our 10 year old and 6 year old. Found it by chance on an internet search and were absolutely delighted from start to finish. Superb service from the reception and bar staff, stunning high quality clean room with water views. this was the quietest, most restful and calmest place we have stayed at in London. Ideal for families, can get into London on DLR or Emirates Air line cable car and river boat. We were looking for somewhere different to stay, and we certainly landed on our feet here. Would thoroughly recommend it to families, or couples looking for a unique, high quality hotel to stay at on a trip to London. Can't think of anything negative to say about this hotel.",5,2015,05,04
119,Amazing. You will not be disappointed,"My husband and I have just returned from our stay here over bank holiday and cannot praise this hotel enough.
The staff are extremely polite and helpful, they really could not of done anything more to make us feel more welcome and valued. The yaught itself is beautiful, Room service was extremely quick, our room was spotless and very spacious, although a little out of the way of the city do not let this put you off, the DLR is a 2 min walk away and 5 minute ride to tower bridge. We actually enjoyed been in a quiet part of the city. the whole stay was a delight. 
I Would highly recommend to anyone considering staying here, we are already looking into booking the sister yaught in Gibraltar",5,2015,05,04
119,Romantic weekend away,"stayed on the Sunborn yacht Saturday and Sunday night and can't rate it highly enough. The staff were very attentive, nothing was too much trouble. Our room was so comfy all mod cons even an iPad by the bed. We had one of our meals on board which was brilliant. I highly recommend this hotel.",5,2015,05,04
119,"Great trip, no customer service","Booked this a few months for myself and best friend for a weekend away.  On arrival the yacht looked beautiful, however on arrival at reception we had to queue to check in.  After 15 minutes waiting to check in, I was surprised as I had read numerous reviews who said the staff were friendly and helpful.  No warm welcome just asked us to pay up front.  Had to pay an additional £40 deposit if we wanted room service!  This is not listed anywhere, so thought this was odd!  We were given no information of the restaurant, bar area or even how to use the lift and no directions to our room.  Very disappointed in this level of service.  Air con in the room springs to life on its own, you can't open the windows so waking up at 2am to find the room at 25 degrees was awful.  However on the upside, great location, lovely room, extremely clean, great coffee machine.  I would go again but the staff need to be more welcoming, felt like I was checking into a Novotel, not a Super Yacht!!",4,2015,05,04
119,My weekend away,"Nice boat very clean room good location 
Bad side I ordered room service for two drinks after four phone calls to find out where my order was a man came to the door and said they were on there way 25 min later still no drinks after two hours of phone calls and hassle still no drinks so my partner went to the reception they said they would sought this out then another 30min later they came spoilt our night nothing but hassle 
Never had such bad service would not ever stay again.
My advise if you stay here and want room service order in the morning the you might just get it in the evening.
And remember ice is made to order.",3,2015,05,02
119,Fantastic micro break,"Sick of sitting in motorway traffic to get away for the weekend we decided travel half an hour from the city to experience London's docklands and we were not disappointed. The glamorous Sunborn was a wonderful place to stay. We had one of their cheapest rooms which was stylish had a huge comfy bed a small lounge area and wonderful view of the dock and the iconic listed cranes. Breakfast was great and all the staff very attentive and helpful. Its in easy walking distance  of Custom House DLR station,the wonderful cable car across the Thames, the O2 and the eXcel centre. Don't miss cocktails in the bar at dusk the city lights are spectacular.",5,2015,05,02
119,Sail away for a 50th Birthday,"Wow it is so great to find a new way in hotels, The Service standards are the best I have ever found in a hotel.
The room was also at a wonderful standard we stayed at 3023 ,given a tour around the ship/hotel a  super place to have  a celebration.
We had a late meal in the restaurant and the quality and presentation was top draw hats off to the chef .",5,2015,05,02
119,It doesn't get better than this.,"I booked this hotel as a nice treat for me and the wife. I have been on a number of cruises and love ships and yacht so thought this would be a good venue. From the point of booking, checking in and departure the service was faultless. The cabin and all the public areas were magnificent. The location is great and perfectly located in easy walking distance of the DLR Customs House station. All the staff were very hospitable and professional and could not do enough to make our stay perfect. Nazma who was on reception was such a good representative of the company that I am checking my diary to see when I can book next.",5,2015,05,02
119,Can't fault it.,"Our second stay on the boat was just as enjoyable as the first in Autumn last year. Impeccable rooms, very attentive and pleasant staff. Excellent all round. It certainly is a different type of experience.",5,2015,04,29
119,Enjoyed the 'cruise'.,"As my wife and I were to attend a meeting at the Excel we were looking for somewhere convenient to stay overnight and were surprised and delighted to come across Sunborn; as regular 'cruisers' we couldn't resist, and were not disappointed. The ship is beautifully maintained to a high standard, the cabin was spacious and very comfortable, and we thought good value for money, although it would have been nice if breakfast had been included. Unfortunately we didn't have a chance to sample the dinner menu as we were entertained elsewhere, but it looked very good. However we did enjoy a good breakfast at a table overlooking the water. All the staff with whom we came into contact were delightful and efficient. Overall we thoroughly enjoyed the experience and look forward to returning when next attending the Excel.",5,2015,04,29
119,I'm on a boat!,"Firstly I must say that I have previously stayed on the sunborn and that the standard has not slipped since my stay last November. The rooms are exceptionally large especially for London and come with the added bonus of a coffee machine. The staff on board are exceptional with nothing being too much trouble and special mention must go to Miriam who couldn't do enough to make our trip extra special. Claudio was also fantastic as was the Spanish man who works in the breakfast restaurant (so sorry I can't remember your name).

Only downside was the air vents in the room are relatively noisy and couldn't be switched off, even after a visit to reception, but the quality of the room and the staff more than made up for this.

Many thanks and I'm sure we'll see you again.",5,2015,04,28
119,Amazing Stay highly recommend,"I stayed here the night before the marathon and it was perfect. The room was spacious, we had free wifi, tea, coffee and water. The room was very clean and the bath room was of a good size too.
Ideal if you are going to the excel but also for the O2 as you can get across to the O2 by the sky rail, also there are loads or great restaurants at the O2 and around the sunborn and even in the sunborn. 
Great for a get away and an unusaul date night

this place will not dissapoint",5,2015,04,28
119,Lovely hotel,stayed for 2 nights wish it had been more lovely spacious room everything spotless and staff  excellent Lovely bar and we had complimentary cocktails the resteraunt looked lovely though never ate there due to other commitments,5,2015,04,28
119,Njr,"Stayed for the weekend with my girlfriend. Was perfect in everyway. Staff very helpful and courteous, had a kingsize river view room, was lovely and big, had a great nights sleep. Would definitely stay again . ",5,2015,04,28
119,Good yacht hotel,"First time to stay at ""yacht"" hotel , indeed it s a Real yacht . I have Been here last month for business purposes , stay for One week . Room is big especially by London Standard , If possible ask room in The higher floor and facing The water . Breakfast is simple ( I got bored after few days ) but do try The dinner , it s pretty nice food . I would stay here again If my purpose is in The nearby area . Fyi takes almost 1 Hour by DLR n tube to Leicester square ( This Will be your biggest consideration )",4,2015,04,27
119,Perfection!,"I was attending a convention at the ExCel building and couldn't have chosen a better location, right on the doorstep! The staff were very friendly and went above and beyond to take care of me.  The room was beautiful and I wanted for nothing, would definitely recommend and can't wait to stay here again!",5,2015,04,27
119,Great for business at ExCel,"I was going to give this hotel a 4/5 but shift manager Romao Catrapona earned the extra point for Sunborn London through outstanding, unsolicited customer service. 

The yacht hotel brings a different experience which is nice if you travel a lot for work. It is clean and as close as you can be from the ExCel convention centre. The outside terrace is nice but can be windy at times for obvious reasons (being on a boat).the room was nice and the Internet was reliable and fast (an important criterion for all business travellers). 

I had issues with the air conditioning not working in my room and called the front desk at 1am with a room at 25 degrees. They promptly apologized for not having a technician available at this time of night, offered me to go sleep in a different room while keeping this one so u would not have to move my stuff at night and offered a fan if I wanted to keep the room. I opted for the fan since I didn't feel like changing rooms and the fan did the trick providing a nice breeze actually. 

When I checked out in the morning, Mr. Romao stepped in to confirm if I was the guest who experienced issues the night before. I had not said a word about it to the front desk lady. He was just proactive. He offered arrangements for my check out that were unsolicited and very generous. The arrangements don't need to be disclosed; what matters is the proactivity and superior customer experience delivered by the shift manager, way beyond financial matters. 

I will be back. ",5,2015,04,26
119,"Splendid, Splendid. Splendid","Greeted by Claudio & Maryium, treated as if i had stayed many times before, helpful, professional, friendly. Rooms great, facilities excellent, 
Great food, Jose & Teadore in the bar, were just as amazing.
If you want somewhere a little different, but high quality & even better service, the Sunborn is the place to stay",5,2015,04,26
119,"Amazing stay, will book again.","We had an amazing stay on the Sunborn for a birthday treat.
Every member of staff we came across was friendly and helpful and always willing to go out of their way to please. 
Our classic river view room was luxurious, thick carpet, huge bed that was so comfortable.
In the bar we sampled a selection of very nice cocktails from the extensive drinks list.
We did not have dinner in the restaurant but the bar menu has a good selection of food and is reasonably priced.
Breakfast was extra at £12.50 each, but was worth it, a large selection of hot food, continental, fruits, pastries.
We will definitely visit again, but will make sure we check in earlier so that we can make the most of the outside deck areas of the restaurant and bar  and take in the view and surprising peacefulness of the dock.",5,2015,04,26
119,"This will ""Float your Boat""!!","For a quirky stay near the O2,The Excel or City airport this floating hotel is ideal.The cabins are spacious and airy with super sized comfy bed.The staff are friendly and professional.We had dinner in the restaurant (make sure to book) which was sumptuous,in taste and presentation.The view from the restaurant as the sun set was beautiful.We will be back.",5,2015,04,25
119,Absolutely Fantastic,Just returned from an amazing stay at the Sunborn. Lovely room with a balcony. Food and drink was excellent. The restaurant's set menu of 3 courses and a glass of fizz is superb. The staff were brilliant with their attention to detail. We shall definitely return.,5,2015,04,25
119,Something a bit different!,"We stayed here for one night recently because we were attending a concert at the O2.  This is a lovely hotel, great rooms (we were in a junior suite with a balcony on the water side), good facilities and lovely staff.  Maryiam and another woman on reception were just so friendly, making me feel like a valued guest.  Everywhere is immaculately clean and it is just fun being on a boat on the river.  So easy to get to the O2, a couple of minutes walk to the cable car then you're there - so much more civilized than the tube or the DLR.  Breakfast was a self-service buffet, all the usual. Our air-conditioning wasn't brilliant but then we were there on two extremely hot days.  Also the wifi left something to be desired but again, everything else outweighed this.  This will be my hotel of choice next time I'm in this area, it's just great.  Had a wonderful time!",5,2015,04,25
119,So not worth it,"The Sunborn yacht is lovely in a brass and chrome and shiny sort of way. The staff is helpful and nice, and the staterooms are large and comfortable. However, there was a total bait and switch pricing scheme. I was told my rate was £189, which apparently was only for two days of my weeks stay. The other nights went to £349 without warning, and did not even include breakfast (also significantly overpriced for the quality). The bathroom had no fan and smelled of mildew, and despite having the heat turned off, to keep the room below 23 degrees I had to have to balcony door open whenever I was in the room.  I probably would have overlooked the mildew and heat if the opaque and misleading charging scheme weren't in place. There are many other hotels in the area - I personally would stay at any of them before returning to the Sunborn.",2,2015,04,25
119,Superb experience ,"Met all expectations just wish we were able to spend more time in the hotel. The room was spacious and exceptionally clean with a fantastic shower wet room. We had a waterside view with a small balcony it was perfect in every way. The reception area, bar and restaurant was sophisticated and stunning with great views of Canary Wharf and the shard. My only grip is that the buffet breakfast could have been hotter   But if given the opportunity we would certainly stop there again. ",5,2015,04,24
119,"Awesome views, excellent food , wonderful room","Last night I had the pleasure of staying and dining at this unusual but exceptional hotel. Check-in was easy, and whenever I passed reception they addressed me by name. The room was spacious, with views over the docks. However, the real views were from the dining room. As the sun went down it became more spectacular. The food was excellent and service attentive. I don't often go to EXCEL, but when I do this is going to be my hotel of choice.",5,2015,04,23
119,Business conference ,Had a business conference onboard this nice hotel. Found the place really clean and what you would expect. The interior is a bit dated but still very nice. We had drinks on the deck with canapés which were superb. I never saw any rooms but I was informed that they were very good ,4,2015,04,23
119,Superb extremely spacious accomodation,Superb accommodation and extremely spacious by London standards with king size bed. and sofa and desk.Only negative was the long wait to get served in the bar with almost no customers and plenty of staff but the reception made up for this with halving our bar bill and wonderful friendly service. Very comfortable bed. Boat solidly moored so no boat movement so fine for those who get seasick.,5,2015,04,23
119,Fantastic,"My partner and I stayed at this hotel and loved it!!! It was a surprise for me and wow I really was. 
It's something different and it's got a lovely feel and atmosphere to the hotel. Lighting and modern touches really add to your stay, but the original features are all still apparent so not to detract from the fact you are on a ship.
The views are amazing and you can take it all in from the bar and deck.
Great rooms, very clean, comfortable and spacious. We had a room on deck 5 with a balcony and it was fab... We only wished the weather had been better so we could've enjoyed it more.
Breakfast was great value and a pleasant change from paying a fortune for a ""London"" breakfast. Please don't change that guys!!
The staff were all really friendly and helpful.
Great location for excel obviously but the DLR isn't too far away to get into London itself.
We will definitely come back. Thanks for a great stay.",5,2015,04,19
119,Luxury stay in London Docklands,"We stayed for two nights with good friends in April 2015. I had been to Sunborn Gibraltar on business and loved it, whilst there I found out there was a yacht in London :)

The yacht does not disappoint. The cabins are luxuriously appointed and the bed very comfortable and large. We had a dockside room on the lowest deck and it was superb.  Next time we will try out a balcony room on the water side to see the difference. Views from the yacht are excellent.

The staff were without exception, friendly and helpful on every occasion we dealt with them. Our room cleaner chatted with us in the corridor on the way out on our first day and wished us a lovely weekend, which was lovely.

The food in the restaurant is really special. A good chef at work here. We opted for the slightly more limited menu £29.95 per head for 3 course and a glass of champagne. The choice was still very good and all of us really enjoyed the presentation and taste of the course.
Wines (in fact drinks in general) are a little expensive.
Breakfast buffet was plentiful and tasty, not so bad for £12.50 on weekends.

The area that the Sunborn is in is delightful. The old docklands area has been regenerated in a sympathetic way, retaining some of the old features whilst also making this a great area to meet, eat and wander.
We went in the Emirates chairlift on the first day and really loved that. 
The area has lots of places to eat, drink coffee etc. A real plus is how quiet it is at night, we slept soundly.
 
A quick nip along the DLR and you are in town visiting all those iconic places. At the day's end, come back to the relative tranquility of the Sunborn.

Things that could be better? A spa area would be nice. Some mugs in the room and perhaps some fresh milk available?  Not much else!

We will be looking out for some deals for more special weekends at the London Sunborn.

",5,2015,04,19
119,Disappointing,"Read all the reviews and it sounded great. Reality is a staid, basic hotel, miles from anywhere other than Excel. Though I did understand it would be a way out of central London getting anywhere took a good 40 mins so just be aware if you want to spend time in the central district. 

The hotel itself is clean and the rooms a good size. We opted for just a double room which puts you at water level with not much of a view. Be prepared to wait around for lifts as the exit is on floor 1 and a half so you have to get the lift for a three foot journey. You get a gimmicky Sony tablet on a foot long cable to book things. Tea and coffee in the room, but only two teabags and a couple of milks. The plug sockets are a mix of UK and Europe which was a bit odd, with two phones and an iPad to charge we ran out. 

The 'bar' on Saturday evening at 7 was left over from breakfast, deserted, uncleaned and just had a lot of tables with empty marmalade pots etc from breakfast that morning. So we left to go elsewhere for a drink. Restaurant was staid and characterless, so again we didn't stay. 

In the immediate area are a few places to eat but you'll need to travel to get anything really good. 

All in all very disappointing, particularly the hotel facilities. We won't be back.",2,2015,04,18
119,Unique place to stay and great for the 02,"Stayed at the Sunborn for the night when going to see Sting and Paul Simon in concert at the 02. We had seen the vessel when visiting the Excel area before and thought it would be an interesting and stylish place to stay and that we could get to our venue via the Emirates cable car.
If anything our stay exceeded our expectations! The boat is impressive, the rooms are very comfortable and our breakfast was superb. Sitting on the terrace in the unusual April sunshine with a cold drink was a delight. However, the highest praise must go to the staff who are effecient, polite, helpful and totally welcoming. In particular we were charmed by a young lady receptionist named Nazma. She alone would make us stay again!",4,2015,04,18
119,Perfection,"Lovely quiet setting (currently), very helpful staff, Maryann on reception especially, but all the staff we met were extremely obliging. Very comfortable cabin, huge comfortable bed, clean, excellent bathroom, great towels with everything we needed. 
Brilliant cocktails with marvelous evening views from the bar, followed by very good food in the restaurant. 
I don't fly but took the cable car which was petrifying, found though that if you keep your eyes shut its not so bad! But I guess most people would adore it.
I highly recommend this hotel.",5,2015,04,18
119,A different Hotel-floating!,"The hotel was lovely - a different experience. The ship was beautiful and our room was spacious.  The staff were very friendly and helpful.  It is in a good location for exploring the Docklands and is very near to ExCel, and the Emirates Air-Line over to the O2 Arena.  It is also easy to get into the centre of London by using the Docklands Light Railway. It is on the flight path from the nearby City Airport, but this did not bother us and the flights do not operate at night.We will certainly use the Sunborn Yacht again.",5,2015,04,18
119,Brilliant birthday treat!,"Spent 2 nights on this beautiful yacht hotel and can't rate it enough. From checking in till checking out, everything felt so luxurious. Nothing was too much trouble for staff and the room was beautiful. The corridors were well maintained and we had great room service. We were lucky enough to have a massive sun deck with a great river view. The room was beautiful and very clean. Very easily accessible from the DLR (you get off at Custom House and it's a couple of minutes walk). We were next door to the 'wheelhouse' and often heard staff having conference calls and meetings. This didn't bother us at all. Thank you for a great birthday stay! Wil definitely be returning!",5,2015,04,18
119,Amazing,"This place is a must to stay and such a special treat. The Sunborn gives you the opportunity to experience the delights of a luxurious yacht but without the expense usually associated with the same. The staff couldn't do enough for us and in particular Lisa Turner was brilliant. There were 14 of us staying and Lisa made the reservation process so simple ensuring our accommodation would meet all of our needs and upgraded our "" Hen"" as a gift. I simply can't recommend this hotel enough. If your questioning whether or not you should book. Don't. You will not be disappointed!",5,2015,04,18
119,A great experience,"We stayed here as a treat for my partners birthday.The room was larger than a double having a sofa and coffee table, 
The room also had a couple of nice gadgets, a coffee pod machine and a Tablet.  Slippers and dressing gowns were also provided. We had a room that had a balcony and overlooked the river. It  was luxurious great view, deep pile carpet, huge power shower, comfortable  super king size bed.The food was excellent, service in the restaurant was faultless and the presentation was good. The Sunborn is not in the heart of the city however it is well connected via the DLR,
Best of all were the views across the Royal Victoria Dock and Canary Wharf, especially over cocktails in the bar, which was nice, breakfast the following morning was also good although it was buffet style.
,",5,2015,04,17
119,Wonderful weekend,"An amazing weekend in London was made even better with our stay on the Sunborn,
Our room / cabin was spotlessly clean and comfortable, the staff were so polite, helpful and friendly.
Breakfast in the restaurant with views of the Sky rail and the O2 arena was a perfect way to start the day.
Great location with easy access to the city with the DLR close by.
This was our second stay at the Sunborn and will definitely be returning and would recommend to anyone wanting something a bit special.",5,2015,04,17
119,Quirky with a Touch of Class,"Chose this hotel for its uniqueness and the fact that it was so reasonably priced compared to Central London hotels. Yes, you really are on a yacht although it's not going anywhere as it doesn't have an engine. My room / cabin, although of the lowest grade, was absolutely huge, really comfortable and spotlessly clean. Great to see the lights on the other side of the water at night. Security was really good which I found quite reassuring as I was travelling on my own. All the staff were exemplary, addressing me by name and going out of their way to help. Nazma at Reception was particularly helpful and friendly, providing me with a bathrobe and slippers when I asked if it was possible to have these. The only slightly negative thing about my stay was the breakfast - no fresh bread or rolls, only sliced bread for toasting. As I prefer a continental breakfast this was slightly disappointing. I also treated three friends for afternoon tea and we were charged for an extra pot of tea which was a bit unnecessary. I was concerned about the location but once I had got to grips with the DLR it was quite straightforward. I also bought a block of ten tickets for the cable car (works out at £1.70 a time instead of £4.50) and accessed the Jubilee Line from North Greenwich. This made it easy to pop across to the O2 as well. This is a great hotel and much more memorable than standard London hotels. I will definitely return and will also recommend it to friends.",5,2015,04,17
119,A unique experience,We stayed here as a treat for my other half's birthday and it excelled our expectations.  From the moment we arrived we were given the best service and the receptionist Maryiann upgraded our room and gave us a discount voucher for drinks in the bar.  We had a lovely meal in the restaurant. We stayed in February but in the summer it would be amazing to sit on deck with a drink to relax.  Some might say it is a little off the beaten track but that added to its charm for us as it was an escape from the rat race. The beautiful wood panelling in the room was very impressive and all was spotless. The central staircase is very glamorous.  Would definitely recommend this hotel for value and excellence.,5,2015,04,16
119,My birthday treat,"I chose the Sunborn for my birthday treat and they didn't disappoint.The staff were excellent Maryiann and Nazma, both on reception, were lovely. Maryiann made my birthday special and I thank her for that.The room was luxurious, huge, great view, deep pile carpet, huge shower, comfortable bed you could happily live there! The food was excellent, service in the restaurant was faultless and the presentation was high class.I had a tablet in the room so didn't have to take mine. On my birthday I had a facial in the Spa, it was the best facial I have ever had.",5,2015,04,16
119,02 overnight stay made easy,"A feeling of absolutely unique luxury from the moment you arrive.   All made better by the fleet of charming, professional and attentive staff, especially front desk and a lovely lady called Nazma who could not have made us feel more special.  This floating hotel offers understated classic charm with 5 Star standards ensuring clean, well appointed cabins with fab views across the river to 02 and Canary Wharf.  Highly recommended for anyone looking for something a little different especially for easy access to London's 02.",5,2015,04,16
119,VERY IMPRESSED,"We stayed on the boat on a Friday / Saturday over Easter. The location of the boat is a little out of London in regard to nightlife. It is excellent for the Excel and the O2, but local bars and restaurants were lacking. However, transport into town is good and appears to run until after midnight. The boat is very impressive - both inside and out, also the staff were very pleasant. Our room was classed as a suite and was extremely nice and came with a balcony, a room without a balcony would feel rather stuffy since I do not believe any windows open. The first night was very quiet, but there was a bit of noise on the Sunday morning from children in another room and running down the corridor - so sound does appear to travel more than in a standard building. I would definitely recommend that you try this hotel, due to the novelty factor - but plan you nights out and possibly pick midweek when there are fewer kids about.",5,2015,04,16
119,Ab Fab and more !!!!,"As the title suggests this hotel is fabulous.  From the moment we checked in to when we checked out the customer service was second to none.  The manageress Emma who was wonderful in helping organise a hen night on board could not do enough for our party.  All of the staff we encountered were pleasant and professional.   The yacht itself is magnificent in all areas and the pictures do not do it justice at all.  A very easy train commute from central London and the return journey was thoroughly enjoyable taking the cable car to Greenwich pier and the river bus straight through to the city, taking in all the sights on the way.  Don't hesitate and just book - you will be so glad you did.",5,2015,04,15
119,Wow wow wow ,"Booked this hotel for my daughters 7th birthday as she he wanted to visit London for a long time and we thought we would make it a special experience for her and this hotel more than delivered. 

Arrived at hotel and was wowed by the hotel, it just oozes glamour and sophistication, the Receptionist had exceptional customer service skills an was so friendly! Felt like we already knew her. So nice to be greeted by some one who was happy to be there.

Was shown to our suite and blown away ! It was 11/10 it was fabulous ! Could not fault a thing.
We thoroughly enjoyed our stay wished we stayed longer than the two nights booked.
Will definitely return x",5,2015,04,15
119,Super Yacht anyone!!,"What an experience, I had a beautiful Yacht Classic River view cabin which was well appointed, with a view across the docks. The room had a Lavazza Coffee machine, Tablet PC and Free WiFi as standard.

The staff are friendly and extremely helpful

The Yacht is fixed in place, so doesn't bob up and down in the water which is a relief for those of you who suffer from sea sickness. The Outside Deck areas are lovely, and the fact that it was one of the hottest days of the year made it all the better

There's something for everyone, a Spa, Bar and a fabulous restaurant. And you're a stones throw away from loads of bars and restaurants as well as the O2 Arena and the Emirates Cable Car.

",5,2015,04,15
119,wow! luxurious and relaxing.,"What a find! A beautiful yacht with a stunning interior. The rooms are a great size as is the bathroom. To find this in London is quite outstanding, especially with the DLR train service being so close. If you have a concertt to go to at the O2 definitely stay here. The staff are very friendly & efficient without being intrusive. I'd stay here again without a doubt and above any other 'normal' hotel.",5,2015,04,15
119,Little gem in amoung faceless hotels,Fabulous rooms with just about anything you could need. Bed was large and extremely comfortable. Beautiful white fluffy towels and also a flannel. Breakfast was lovely and view was spoilt by the smog tho. ,5,2015,04,15
119,Superb Sunborn Stay!,Stayed for one night on the Sunborn London in January. Upgraded to a Riverside suite which was beautiful. Staff were all very accomodating as we arrived early and needed somewhere to leave our bags. Excellent location for London Excel and also the DLR. Couldn't fault our stay.,5,2015,04,14
119,Could have been excellent but...,"At the end of last year I booked two cabins, one with balcony, directly with the hotel. Because I had received nothing in writing I 'phoned the night before we were due to arrive to confirm the reservations. It took some time but they found them - but under my daughter's name? We arrived early afternoon and again there were problems finding the reservations but eventually (again) they were found and we completed the required paperwork and gave them our credit card details. The cabins were not ready *understandable as it was 2 hours before check-in time) and we headed off to our event at the O2. When we returned we were again informed that they could find no trace of our reservations - even though we had 'checked in'. It then transpired that there was only one room booked and the second room had been booked for the 1 April. (At this stage I felt that we were the April Fools and suggested that we got a late train home).
Eventually we were provided with cabins (I think one was upgraded) and found them to be lovely. Elegant veneered furniture, spacious and very comfortable. The views were wonderful and I can thoroughly recommend the cabins as a unique change to the standard London hotel.
The following morning we had a good breakfast but the check-in situation still bothered me. I spoke with the manager who hadn't known about the chaos and then couldn't have been more apologetic.  No-one can explain what happened and why I felt I was in some sort of Groundhog Day movie. 
What also transpired is rather lovely in that the whole venture is very community based and many of the staff were brought in as young unemployed trainees. 
If we return (high probability) we shall ensure that we have the reservation in writing in advance; it is a lovely place to spend the night when up in London.",4,2015,04,14
119,Could this be the best hotel ever?,"Arrived on Monday at this amazing yacht hotel and we were looked after by Maryiam on reception. For the first night we stayed in a beautiful riverside room however today because it's a special occasion for my wife Jean we moved next door to the Riverview Executive Suite which is absolutely fantastic with its private balcony , and a sauna in the double bath /shower room. All the staff are so friendly and helpful however special praise has to be extended to Maryiam who is the perfect hostess . The interior of the yacht is phenomenal and is probably 6 or 7 stars . Jean and I have stayed in some of the best hotels in the world and I would rate this in our top three. We will definitely be back probably to see a special performance at the O2 which is a few minutes away on the Emirates Cable Cars . Awesome",5,2015,04,14
119,Very Nice!,This is a fantastic hotel. Staff are all very friendly and helpful and room was exceptional.  Size of the room is much bigger than the  majority of standard rooms in London. Bar very quiet so not much atmosphere but view from the bar is amazing.,5,2015,04,13
119,Romantic break,"We stayed for only one night, but were upgraded to a junior suite which was lovely with a bedroom and lounge area. 
The restaurant was very good and we had a wonderful evening meal with very attentive service and very tasty food.
The lounge area of the boat is also lovely with lots of sofas and we had no trouble finding a seat.
Being a boat you are a bit limited in other hotel facilities, eg no pool etc. However it was a great experience.",4,2015,04,12
119,birthday treat,"We spent a night on the sunborn as a treat for my husband's birthday. I booked one of their more basic rooms but we couldn't have been more comfortable even in the more expensive rooms. The staff are brilliant everyone we came into contact with was very friendly helpful and attentive. The restaurant was lovely the food was wonderful and the view looking over the dock, O2 and canary wharf was something special. Breakfast was brilliant lots of choices in a buffet style but we were not rushed and it all added up to a wonderful stay. I can't recommend it enough and we shall certainly treat yourself to another stay in the near future.",5,2015,04,11
119,amazing hotel,"We stayed for 2 nights in the amazing and wonderful hotel. We had 3 rooms, all with a dock view. There were 7 of us including an elderly relative who has poor mobility. The rooms were very spacious, had a real luxury feel about them and the beds and bedding were wonderful. The rooms were spotlessly clean. 
The staff at the hotel were efficient, helpful, courteous and professional at all times. A special mention must go to the housekeeping staff who were cheerful, always willing to help with any request.
When we did have an issue with something it was dealt with immediately and without being made to feel like a nuisance.
This hotel is quirky, luxurious and whilst it is quite expensive, it was worth it.
My only criticism is the £19 for breakfast. We went 'ashore' to the local café (which was literally a 5 minute walk from the boat) and had a full English for £5.
Whilst the rooms are not equipped for someone who is disabled (as the bathroom has a step up into it as does the shower) the hotel itself is totally wheel chair friendly. Our elderly relative cannot walk long distances and we found all areas of the hotel to be accessible when using the wheel chair.
I cannot recommend this hotel highly enough...give it a try; you will not be disappointed!",5,2015,04,11
119,Something a little different!,"We have just spent 2 nights onboard this purpose built yacht/hotel. Staff were lovely and very attentive, nothing to much trouble. Breakfast was great. It consisted of a very large buffet, something for everyone. We had booked a water view with balcony which I would recommend. Parking in the near by car park was £15 per 24 hours which is quite reasonable. The only disappointment was the decor all a bit tacky for our liking. Lots of bronze mirrors and a pallet of brown and green velour, such a shame for such a beautiful yacht, .just needs to be brought up to date. This did not spoil our break and it made a change to be in this area. A ride in the Emerates pods is a must, fantastic views.",4,2015,04,11
119,Amazing,"We only spent one night on the Sunborn but it was amazing. The rooms were immaculate and the staff lovely. We did not eat or drink so cannot comment on that but the location is fab, right beside the Emirates Airline and the DLR line. We will definitely be back!  ",5,2015,04,10
119,Sunborn Review - Great value considering where you are,"We spent one night on the Sunborn, London, we got upgraded to a Executive room overlooking to Thames and view of Emirate Cable Car. Cocktails and snacks on Deck, food and drinks very reasonable considering where you are. £15 flat rate for 24 hours parking at Excel.
Hotel receptionist was great Nazma and the voucher for a 1/2 price drink helped.
Dinner was excellent and again very reasonable. only downsides 1 price of Breakfast £20 for all you can eat and the other was that we had a voucher from the concierge for 2 for 1 at dinner. not all that is says you actually only get one course free. so if you order a 3 course meal and the cheapest item in our case Soup was £6.50 that is your free item not 2 for 1 for dinner. We got caught out but as the food was very very good we accepted it but just be careful. would definitely visit again",5,2015,04,10
119,21st Birthday Treat,"First things first, the hotel is gorgeous and in a lovely quiet area! Reception area perfect for piccies under the chandelier! staff were very welcoming and rooms incredibly comfy. 
A couple of downsides;- we booked to go to the restaurant expecting the set menu-£29 however neither on the menu nor when we booked did staff say we had to book the set menu.... and then we were not allowed it which made our bill expensive even though what is on the set menu is on the actual menu so there shouldnt of been an issue.  Also drinks service was very slow although cocktails were lovely. Look oout for the 12.5% discrepancy.",4,2015,04,09
119,Excellent luxury Easter weekend stay!,"This was a special treat for a 20th anniversary and we had booked on recommendations from friends who had stayed there before -  a little different to your run of the mill hotel! We arrived on Saturday morning and parked in the Royal Victoria Dock car park which had a flat rate of £15 per 24 hours and was a safe and secure place to park and approx. 5 minute walk to the Sunborn yacht. Check in was after 3 and this was a speedy process.  We had requested a room with a balcony and we were not disappointed.  It was a large room with plenty of space for the two of us - luxurious and clean with a good sized bathroom.  There was a welcoming letter from the manager congratulating us on our anniversary - something that many of the staff did on their first meeting with us which was a perfect personal touch!

The stay was a fantastic experience - all staff were accommodating and friendly making every effort to make us feel welcome and comfortable at all times.  Reception staff were always available for enquiries and even took photos of us as a couple (very hard to do when there is only 2 of you!) - Nazma was particularly friendly and took time to talk with us - another personal touch.  

We were able to order halal meat as a special request prior to the visit and this was cooked beautifully by the chef.  We also opted for breakfast on the yacht - this is not included in the price of the room but was well worth the money with both hot and cold breakfasts offered including vegetarian options and fresh salmon. The staff were making sure that the food was continuously topped up.  Bilal - one of the restaurant staff - was lovely, making sure we were aware of the vegetarian options and ensuring we were happy with the meal.  

The yacht is close to the DLR trainline which can take you into central London.  It is also a 5 minute walk from the Emirates cable cars which take you to the O2. So is a peaceful location to be able to return to after attending events in central London. 

All staff on the yacht made out experience a truly memorable one from the moment we arrived until the moment we left and we will return I am sure. This is a lovely place to celebrate a special event with loved ones.",5,2015,04,07
119,Fantastic stay.,"My husband and I spent one night on Sunborn along with our friends to celebrate my friend's and husband's birthday. We were delighted with our rooms which were beautiful with a balcony overlooking the river.  The hotel is flawless and beautifully clean. The Sunborn is just a short walk away from the Emirates airline which is great for getting to the O2. We found the staff so friendly and helpful. Special thanks go to Maryiam, who went out of her way to make our stay enjoyable. We will definatley be returning.

Angela & Jason",5,2015,04,07
119,fantastic stay,"Spent a fabulous night on the Sunborn celebrating my birthday.  Hotel is immaculately clean throughout and very secure.  Cocktails are a must and are a delight when sitting out on deck with stunning views over the city and the O2. Staff were all amazing but must mention Maryiam who just could not do enough for us, even putting up with my cheeky husband!!  Fabulous sleep in a huge comfy bed and though very near City airport, we were not disturbed by plane noise.  Will definitely be going back",5,2015,04,07
119,A wonderful experience on the stunning Sunborn yacht!,"My husband and I spent just one night on Sunborn as a surprise for my husband's birthday as we were going to see Lionel Richie at the O2 Arena. From the moment we stepped onto the yacht we were made to feel very special! We were warmly greeted by Romao Catrapona upon our arrival and were very kindly upgraded. All of the staff we came into contact with had a kind, friendly and professional approach and nothing was too much trouble at all. 
Our room was beautiful with a balcony overlooking the river - we couldn't have asked for more! The proximity of the yacht to the O2 was great and we found the Emirates airline close by too which was great for getting to North Greenwich or you can easily use the DLR/underground which is also easily accessible from the yacht. 
I can't recommend Sunborn enough! It certainly is a real treat and definitely has that extra special something! We will be visiting again during the the Summer with our two girls so we can explore London and then return to the yacht to relax and recharge our batteries! Thank you so much to Romao and his team for giving us a lovely time with memories to treasure.",5,2015,04,06
119,Most wonderful experience!,"Beautiful unusual and unique experience, stunning accommodation and staff are nothing short of wonderful. Nothing was too much trouble for them, our young daughter was made very welcome and the family room was big enough for the 3 of us. 
Although it's out of central London there's plenty of easy access via cable cars, water taxi, DRL and taxi. 
We will return very soon. 

Thank you to everyone who made our family bank holiday extra special. ",5,2015,04,06
119,"Amazing Views, Even Better Accomodation and flawless hospitality","I stayed at the hotel as a stop off point for Honey moon, however ended up extending my stay. I have stayed at many hotels and for a bespoke hotel, with professional staff and for a reasonable price, i dont think you can go wrong. big shout out to receptionist miriam, alejandro, and claudio...and the others! thanks for an amazing stay! hope to come over and over!",5,2015,04,05
119,Mesmerizing & unforgettable experience,"We stayed for two nights and must admit that from the very beginning everything was extremely good , immaculate rooms , stunning views , nothing was too much trouble. We had a dinner in the resturant and don't remember when we had such a fine food, different but impeccably good, also sound serivce. Breakfast without a sin, well cooked , tasty. 
Its been a pleasure to experiance sunborn. 
Exquisite stay, will be back !!!",5,2015,04,05
119,A truly amazing stay on this wonderful yacht.,Me and my wife have just returned from a two-night stay on the Sunborn. The yacht is stunning and from the moment you step on board you know you are in for something special. The reception area is beautiful with a spiral staircase and the staff are VERY helpful and polite. Checking in was straightforward and when we saw our room (King Size) it was amazing...I am not sure why the hotel is classed as only being 4 stars as everything about it is 5 stars. I have read some reviews on here about the breakfast being expensive but at £12.50 each for a buffet breakfast I thought it was reasonable. The food was fabulous. The hotel is a 5 minutes walk from two DLR stations (Custom House and Royal Victoria) and you can get into central London in about 40 mins. The O2 is about 10 mins away using the Emirates Sky Line. When you have been in central London for the day it is nice to get away from the hustle and bustle and I can't recommend a stay at the Sunborn highly enough! We didn't try the restaurant but if the rest of the hotel is anything to go by it will be a fantastic. We had drinks at the bar on our last night and there is a table service and they really look after you. The bar area is a good size and it wasn't too busy so was a good relaxing experience.,5,2015,04,05
119,A Different Kinda Trip,"We were in London for a couple of days over the BH weekend.  The Sunborn is slightly off the 'beaten track' however it is well connected via the DLR and Emirates Sky Link, so by no means difficult to get to.  The staff are incredibly friendly and helpful, nothing is too much trouble.
The accommodation itself is different because its a decommissioned cruise ship, by that please don't misunderstand, its not inferior in anyway.  In fact it was in superb condition, the room was larger than a standard double, it had an excellent power shower, a massive super king size bed, that was exceptionally comfortable and there was very little noise to disturb at night.  Even the ambient sounds of the hotel were minimal.
The room also had a couple of nice gadgets, a coffee pod machine and a Sony Expedia Tablet.
Best of all were the views across the Royal Victoria Dock and Canary Wharf, especially over cocktails in the bar, which was nice, and breakfast the following morning.
Breakfast was good, scrambled egg (always a bit of an indicator of quality) was good, no runny mess here. 
Would definatley recommend to people looking for a well priced 'quirky / fun' stay for a few nights, provided you are using public transport.",5,2015,04,05
119,break with a difference,"We spent just one night on the boat, there were two adults and two children, 14 and 11. We had an amazing time. The room had loads of room for the four of us and we slept really well. The only down side was that the food was very expensive but a 2 min walk from the boat were lots of restaurant which were better value for money. But over all I would recommend a stay on board. ",4,2015,04,04
119,Honeymoon ,"We spent 3 nights on this wonderful yacht and from the moment we stepped on board we were made to feel very special. We were given a room upgrade and the service was impeccable. The food both dinner and breakfast was lovely and found the links via the DLR very useful. The rooms are beautifully finished and very large (the bathrooms a tad small!) and the staff are very attentive. We are planning another visit either later in the year either to this one or one abroad, we highly recommend the experience! Thank you to all the staff for making our stay a fantastic one!!  ",5,2015,04,04
119,Makes a great change from your ordinary hotel!,"Large rooms, very comfortable and spotless everywhere. Nice molten brown toiletries, and coffee machine. Rooms are quiet, so we slept well. It's very close to the O2, but at most times of day you'll be much quicker getting there by tube than by taxi.",5,2015,04,02
119,'Fantastic',"Had a great 2 nights on this boat. When we arrived we got a free upgrade to a room with a balcony as they asked what the occasion was? My husbands 50th birthday. Staff, food and room were all great and very friendly especially they remember your name and wish a happy birthday to my husband on the morning of his birthday.I would recommend this hotel and would definitely stay there again.",5,2015,04,02
119,All that glitters is not gold...,"The Sunborn at first glance, gives the impression of a luxury cruise liner with all the trimmings. Sadly though, on closer examination, not all is as it seems.

This is ultimately a Premiere Inn on water. Get a balcony view over looking the water and your morning is definitely going to start well. Get one overlooking the Excel, then frankly not so much.

Get one without a balcony and you really have to ask what you're paying for. 

There are hardly any facilities on board whatsoever. The Hotel has a deal with the local Crowne Plaza down the road for use of their Spa Facilities, so at least you have access to a pool, sauna etc. but it's a walk. No traipsing down in your slippers and gown. 

And talking of which, both sippers & gowns are offered in the room, but the two gowns  we had, were torn and shabby.

The Molton Brown toiletries whilst seeming old hat are at least decent, but seeing the boat has an Elemis Beauty Salon, one wonders why they are not offering their products throughout the hotel.

However the faux marble sink, looked more dirty than marble, the grouting in the bathroom needed a refresh and the shower was adequate not luxury. The television is very poorly positioned in the room and the buttons for room service etc. on the phone did not work. 

The night time room service menu is extremely restricted, but reasonably priced and reasonable quality (again, not luxury) however the service was very good.

As with all hotels, a ludicrously overpriced breakfast is available. The cooked option is buffet style with even the eggs being left to congeal in a domed warming dish. There are considerably better options near by for far less money.

The Sunborn is positioned brilliantly for the Excel & the O2, whose customers you have to assume they are targeting. But this part of town is a huge trek if you're looking for a central London experience. 

And if the Emirates Airline is out of operation due to high winds (a very rare occurrence but happened whilst on our stay) not that easy to get to the O2 either.

My arrival was problematic, due to a break down of communications between management and staff. But overall the staff were pleasant and helpful once the initial problems were ironed out.

A shout out does have to go out to the barmaid Teadora, whose excellent customer service skills made at least the bar experience feel slightly more akin to a luxury environment, than the rest of the offering.

Overall, I feel this venue is way overpriced for what it is. Even when paying £125 a night for a Balcony overlooking the water and breakfast for 2, it felt way too much. 

It's a Disney experience, an illusion of what the offer is and if you're happy with that, I'm sure you'll enjoy your stay, I however definitely won't be back,",3,2015,04,02
119,Luxurious...!!,"Booked  Sunborn Yacht Hotel as a special treat for friend & I. It was an amazing experience. We were in ore of this hotel. We felt welcomed by the friendly staff on board. We had a fantastic cabin/room with a balcony over looking the Thames. It was easy to find & parked in the Excel centre. Parking 24 hours was very cheap. The food was good although  a bit pricey but we were treating ourselves . Breakfast was good & plentiful. There was a deal on for breakfast so good. We used the cable cars in the evening to cross over Thames, minimal walk to the 02 for show & over train after to get back as cable cars shut. This was a fantastic & amazing experience staying on board the Sunborn Hotel,London . Will definitely book again as a special treat again.",5,2015,04,02
119,Great venue for birthday celebration,"It was my birthday and we decide to attend this venue by booking 3 rooms.  When we arrived I was greeted by staff who wished me a happy birthday and immediately upgraded all our rooms.   The staff were very welcoming and nothing was too much.  They attention to detail is superb.  Our rooms were superb and breakfast was amazing with lots of choice.  We will certainly visit again.

Thank you all for a memorable birthday from all of my party guests",5,2015,04,01
119,Credit given where credit due,"A wonderfully refreshing stay with polite, friendly, professional & helpful staff. Hotel is immaculate as was our room. Reasonably priced drinks at the bar. An absolutely fabulous stay. I can't recommend this hotel highly enough. We will definitely be back.",5,2015,04,01
119,Niggles not expected!,"We booked a couple break via Hotel.com. On arrival we were stunned to see the yacht and checked in. Our room was 1044 towards the end of the corridor on the low deck. 
Our room was nice, but felt it slightly basic. I'd relate it to a nice Premier Inn room with a lovely porthole looking out onto the river. 
I thought it was odd to only have 1 chair around the table. The bed was a great size and very comfortable. 
We found the mini bar was empty except for 4 water bottles. The receptionist had said they were complimentary, but a price list told us they were £1.50 each. For 2 days there were 4 sparkling bottles. We enquired about the price and were told the price list must have been out of date. 
Found it odd that there weren't gowns in the room. When we enquired they were eventually brought to the room!
Our major complaint was the continuous banging we could hear. On Sunday afternoon it took reception (once we'd worked out how to phone them as the phones weren't programmed) 90 minutes to come to our room to investigate. The person who came said he'd report back to us his findings, but he didn't. The noise was similar to a chair rocking on a windy balcony. 
When we returned from our evening out, the noise had ceased. 
After a busy Monday in London, we returned at midnight and fell asleep. We were woken at 2am with the loud banging back. It didn't stop all night. We didn't get back to sleep at all. I have recorded the noise and reported it to reception, but not sure she believed or understood our complaint. She said nobody else had complained. 
A nice yacht. Cocktails in the bar were lovely as was breakfast on Sunday at £12.99. Decided it was not worth the increase in price during the week to £19.99 though!",3,2015,03,31
119,"Great Venue,Pity about the Rest.","Went with 25 Rotarians and Wives for our Club's 30th Charter Anniversary. Started with bar had 2 peroni, I G&T and small lemonade, over £20. Went in for meal at £45 per head. Starter was leek and potato soup, could have been anything but was hot after waiting over half an hour to be served. main course chicken came up with what we all thought was garnish, but no, 1 leaf of curly kale, I small dollop runny mash and sauté! potatoes which were 4 thin slices of plain potato, chicken was also bland. Well at least we had strawberries and ice cream to come, wife joked we would only get one strawberry and she was right, sliced into 6 thin slices with dollop of ice cream and small piece of pastry which was supposed to be meringue. A complete rip off which all 50 of us agreed upon. Don't know what the restaurant is like for residents but would not recommend anyone going there for a function. 50 Rotarians and wives cannot all be wrong.",1,2015,03,31
119,All At Sea,"The entrance is stunning, with lots of gleaming brass and crystal and the most welcoming reception staff. Asked 'what time did you book dinner' (It wasn't mentioned by the third party booking site), I hadn't, so was promised a call in the room to let me know if my preferred time was possible. The charming Allesandro showed us to our balcony room and explained the coffee machine and how the room card allowed us in and out. He even went to the trouble of bringing 2 jugs of hot milk so we could have cappuccinos. Our dinner time was confirmed as slightly earlier than we'd have liked, but a separate call from the Restaurant gave us our chosen time. We had bubbly on our balcony looking at a not terribly exciting view - very remote from the city, and there was no table to accompany the chairs, although after dark it's fun to watch the lit up cable cars moving across the skyline..
Dinner was excellent. Our free glass of champagne arrived promptly, the reception and waiting staff were first class. Nothing was too much trouble and they worked the restaurant expertly, discreetly and oh so smoothly. Ten Stars to them all. The scallop - just one - was the smallest I've seen, overwhelmed by far too much pea purée, but tasty and perfectly cooked. My friend had the lamb which was lovely, pink and perfect as was my pork belly meal - four large squares - very tasty, and with crispy crackling.
I had the best ever sticky toffee pudding - gooey but with an outer  crunch, my friend opting for the panna cotta, also excellent. I'd selected the Three Choirs Gloucestershire white which was reasonably priced and perfectly chilled and served. Throughout the dinner the staff were discreetly attentive and anticipated everything we needed, serving our meal in a timely fashion and I couldn't fault the evening. Breakfast, a buffet, was excellent and offered everything one could want. No dried up items in the chafing dishes, as the vigilant staff were constantly replenishing items - even the fried egg was still runny. My friend went off menu by asking for 2 poached eggs which were cooked promptly and to perfection.  It's so important for hotel staff training to be thorough in all areas and, with a background in high end customer service I'd say they are amongst the best I've come across.
Now, here's the thing. After dinner there was no 'entertainment', only the bar, and the ship is miles from anywhere so I do think a singer or pianist, or something is needed. The bed was comfortable, there was a fridge in the room, but absolutely no hotel information, even tho there is 24 hour room service, but no idea of what's on offer, not that there's much to know, and hat's off to our, again charming, checkout receptionist, who told us the hotel aims to minimise it's paper trail and would upgrade information on the room tablet shortly. I would certainly recommend this super yacht, being the four stars it lays claim to, but the staff are most definitely 10 stars!!! If you're going to the Excel centre have an overnight stay and, though we didn't, you could take advantage of the Elemis Spa and have a lovely relaxing foot massage!",4,2015,03,30
119,city break,"Great location.handy for everything. 
The hotel it's self is stunning.  If your looking too treat your other half you won't go far wrong by booking this.some really nice pubs/restaurants near by and only a 20 minute journey into the centre of London",5,2015,03,30
119,Unbelievable experience!,"If you have never experienced this you need to!  I travel all over the world and generally stay in pretty nice hotels but The Sunborn, London is one of the best I have ever stayed in.  Yes its a unique setting but the staff, management and atmosphere were exceptional.

I look forward to going back very soon...Thanks Andreas and Team.",5,2015,03,30
119,amazing birthday treat,"I booked as a surprise for my husbands birthday and wasn't disappointed. I booked the romantic package which included dinner and champagne and upon arrival got a free upgrade to a suite, couldn't have been happier :)_",5,2015,03,30
119,Amazing! Absolutely incredible stay,"Myself and my partner stayed at the Sunborn last night, and it was incredible!!
The best trip we have done in the UK. 

We were looked after by such friendly staff, who even upgraded us to the executive suite, as it was my birthday. 

The food was 5*, as was the cleanliness of the hotel. 

We each had a fantastic deep tissue massage at the spa aswell. 

We will both definitely be attending",5,2015,03,29
119,Cocktails after exhibition,"My sister and I took our 80year old mum for cocktails and nibbles after an exhibition yesterday. We were so impressed with the entrance, it's stunning and so immaculate. 
The staff were so friendly and helpful, nothing was too much trouble and we were only having cocktails and nibbles. Our Mum loved it. Will definitely return. Thank you. ",5,2015,03,29
119,Almost perfect,"You can't get closer to ExCel's west door and when you've had a full day exhibiting its great to stagger into the Sunborns lift access dockside.  They have a 10 year lease so there's at least 9 more years to try this unique stay.

Room was generous and quiet. Only downside was air con which didn't seem to function properly.  I stayed 2 nights and reported it after first night but didn't see any improvement.

Bar was relaxed and they serve food. Views good at night.

Restaurant comfortable, food smart if served a little on cool side. 3 courses were £50 a La carte with 1 glass wine.

I'll stay again in 2 years when next at ExCel.",4,2015,03,27
119,Already booked again!!,"We stayed here for one night to go and watch matilda the musical. We arrived early and managed to get checked in straight away. The reception were lovely, bubbly and very helpful. The beds are so comfortable, room spotless and very spacious. We loved the coffee machine they provided and also the tablet, which we ordered chicken tikka for room service! The meal wasn't great and very over priced however this did not ruin our stay. We have booked already to come back here for my birthday but we have decided to book a executive room with balcony and river view as we were facing the docks!",5,2015,03,27
119,something different,"The idea of staying on a yacht rather than one of the hundreds of branded hotel rooms is what attracted me to the Sunborn.

The hotel itself was clean with larger rooms than you would expect and well appointed with everything you would need for either a business or leisure stay. 

Reception is on the third floor but located awkwardly close to the central staircase when a few people are trying to check in or out at the same time. 

The staff are very attentive as you would expect. 

Overall, I would put this on a par with a Marriott hotel but possibly better value for money. 

There is an excellent view of the local skyline particularly at night which makes up for the location in relation to central attractions. 

Good links to the central attractions via the DLR are a five minutes walk away. 

Worth a stay if you want something slightly different although when 'on board' you would struggle to differentiate from a conventional hotel. 
",4,2015,03,26
119,Weekend break,We decided to stay on the Sunborn as we wanted to try something a little different and we were not disappointed. The room was very clean and the staff pleasant and helpful.They seem to have trouble when they take a credit card for payment as they later phoned to say the card had been declined but the issue seems to be at their end but other than that we were pleased with our stay.,4,2015,03,24
119,Fantastic Hotel!,"We had a marvellous weekend aboard The Sunborn; from start to finish everything surpassed our expectations.  The fit-out of the yacht is luxurious; the rooms are spacious with everything you could need (including small espresso machine and an iPad!), and as we were blessed with sunshine, sitting on deck sipping a glass or champagne was as good as being at sea.  Points to note are : all the rooms are great, it doesn't really matter if you have a balcony or not; the dinner was excellent and very good value (£42.00 for three courses including complimentary glass of champagne); the trendy bar is open until 1.00pm and serves hot bar snacks until midnight.  We went to a concert at the Albert Hall and got back at 11.45 pm having a hot midnight snack and a nightcap was the perfect way to end a special evening.   Despite being in London, wine and drinks prices were reasonable.

The best thing of all is the service, all the staff from reception to the restaurant to the chambermaids are friendly, courteous and nothing is too much trouble to make you feel welcome.  We loved it, and despite the distance from the centre of London (45 minutes by DLR and tube, or about the same in a taxi ) we'd definitely stay again next time we have things to do in central London.",5,2015,03,24
119,Quality accommodation,"We have stayed here a  Few times. The rooms are spacious, clean and very comfortable - and compared to other Lodon hotels is exceptional value. The outstanding feature are the staff who are very helpful, effective and efficient - with a positive attitude. Breakfast is on the expensive side but the quality of food is very pleasing. This hotel is a jewel and I hope as its popularity grows it maintains the high standards it has set",5,2015,03,24
119,Absolutely Stunning Hotel!,"The Sunborn hotel is gorgeous. The rooms are quite big and with clean, classy decor. We were lucky enough to get a waterside room, which houses a nice view of the dock. We stayed in a family room which had brilliant facilities; tassimo coffee machine, a decent sized tv, a well stocked (if overpriced) mini bar and lots of grooming amenities. 

The bed was big and cosy, the pillows are quite firm, which is something I am a fan of. The bathroom was standard, good powerful shower and plenty of towels, replaced daily. 

It was easy to access from central London, the DLR from XCel Custom House to several tube stations, which could then take you to whichever part of central London you wish to travel to. For £12.50 you could buy a travel ticket (valid on tubes and DLR, all day, zones 1-6) which is great and saves a lot of money. 

We didn't try the on board restaurant or bar as it seemed a little pricey (probably great quality but we preferred to eat in central London) but there is a teacup express around 5 minutes away on the waterfront. There is also the bridge directly behind Sunborn which you can take stairs up to, from there you have a beautiful view of Central London Skyline which looks wonderful when lit up at night!

It was a great stay, with professional and friendly staff. Would definitely stay here again when we visit London.",5,2015,03,23
119,An absolute gem,"wonderful stay at this hotel. A luxury boat near the Excel Centre,

Room large, very comfortable large double bed. Sofa that can be used as an extra bed. Coffee machine, Sony tablet computer, Molton Brown products, everything you need. Good free wifi.

Excellent staff very helpful nothing is too much trouble. Lovely restaurant and bar area.

We booked here as going to the O2 and it is easy to get there. Emirate Air Line is a short walk away. Close to Customs House DLR. Restaurants closeby we found a very good Italian.

We are going back have booked another night. I have stayed in some poor hotels in London, this was a gem.
, 
",5,2015,03,23
119,weekend break,"Took a chance on booking here for the novelty and we were really delighted with it, very warm welcome and helpful front desk staff. The room we had was an exec with a very comfy bed and so quiet despite being full the night we were staying. We had some lovely cocktails from the bar and a good breakfast. Catch the cable car from the Emirates station just along the dock and then the river taxi into the city for a different way of getting around.",4,2015,03,23
119,Great place to stay,We stayed at the sunborn London hotel on 20th of March I can't fault it staff brilliant room the same what ever you wanted was no trouble I wanted some flowers in the room for my partner and they sorted it I'll be going back I'll give them 10 out of 10 thanks sunborn,5,2015,03,22
119,Great stay,just got back from a one night stay at the Seaborn boat hotel great stay very smart and very clean the only thing I can say is the check in seems to be very complicated and takes a long time but ones passed that it was all very good but I must say Watch out for the service charges they seem to just appear on the bill with out you knowing but we had a great time and would definitely stay again.,4,2015,03,22
119,5 Star From Start To Finish,"Having dined on the Sunborn before I decided to take my husband there for an overnight stay with dinner and breakfast to celebrate his 60th birthday. 
It's impressive from the outside and continues to impress throughout. Exiting the lift at the reception level there is a huge chandelier and grand glass and copper staircase. 
Nazma greeted us - she's a treasure. She is so bright and cheerful and believes in the hotel. She was excited to be able to tell us our room was upgraded to a fourth floor executive king with balcony and river view. Fantastic! 
The room was lovely. Huge bed, sofa, TV, tablet full if info, mini bar, heated bathroom floor .... beautiful. There was a handwritten welcome note from the manager with a few chocolates, also wishing my husband a happy birthday. That was a nice touch. In fact most members of staff mentioned the birthday. 
We had half price vouchers for our first drink in the bar so we had pre-dinner cocktails. Dinner was very nice; very Cordon Bleu. 
We had a perfect night's sleep followed by a delicious breakfast. 
Checkout is midday so we could take our time over breakfast and packing. 
Lovely Nazma was eager to be the one to check us out. She really is a breath of fresh air!!
It was a perfect stay - I wish we could have stayed longer!",5,2015,03,21
119,Strange sleeping on a boat to nowhere,"stayed one night before flying out of London City. Staff really friendly, rooms are great size and really comfortable. Internet fast and reliable. Had a few drinks in the bar staff knowledgeable and helpful, have to chose carefully where you sit if you want a conversation as music is a little loud. Did not have breakfast or food onboard so can't comment. But would definitely stay again",5,2015,03,20
119,A yacht!,"So the best thing about the hotel is the fact that you can tell your friends you are staying on a yacht.

Lovely hotel,lovely staff. We had a room with a balcony with a view of the Thames. I think I may have been disappointed if we had a view of the exhibition centre. It's small as you would expect, but tastefully done. Lots of mod cons, and touches of luxury. The balcony USA but if a disappointment- if you sit down you can't see anything as its a high metal balcony.

We went last summer during their soft opening which seems to be going on for some time. So limited services.
Location is right beside exhibition centre and in the docks area.  Some reasonable restaurants nearby. And a city Tesco I think 5 mins walk away. I felt v safe.

To get to it we used the docks railway to exhibition centre and walked down. Maybe 5 mins walk, not worth getting a taxi which would have to go a strange route indeed to get close.
Location is fantastic for O2. We got the Emirates cable car over. Then last tube back. 

Overall wonderful time.  Would I go again? Not  sure it was a bit pricey for what it is and more of a novelty. However I did enjoy it and certainly a hotel to remember.

If this was helpful, please tick. Thanks",4,2015,03,19
119,WOW !! What a beautiful place.,We arrived very late one Sunday night after a very long journey. The staff couldn't have been more helpful. We were asked to be in the dining room as quickly as possible as they were due to close but once we were seated the food and service amazing. The cabin was spotless and so comfortable. Our only regret was we had to leave early the next morning for a business meeting. Even had a free lesson in using the camera on my mobile.,5,2015,03,19
119,woweeeee,"1night stay in March for business.
Excellent hotel, clean, friendly staff.
Excellent food. Had room service dinner and food was piping hot, breakfast was buffet style with waitress on hand for coffee/ tea etc.
I had a balcony room on the top deck, lovely views of the O2 and surrounding dockllands.
Luxury in a nutshell.

The location is good for Canary Wharf and the O2........DLR and tube ride away from the City Centre.

I left my jewellery in the room and only realised 2 hours later. The manager personlly went to collect the items for me.

Cannot reccommend this hotel enough. If you want a treat get booking !!",5,2015,03,18
119,An excellent alternative to a traditional hotel,"This 'floating' hotel was chosen as a treat for our daughters birthday for both its hospitality, quality and central location for sightseeing London. All our desires were easily met.

Access is easy as the DLR station (Customs House) is but a maximum 5 minutes walk away. There is not a car park available from the hotel but there is a NCP operated car park a short walk away but we were advised that the charges are horrendous. London City airport is but a couple of DLR stations away and the hotel is on the flight path - but I stress that noise is not an issue here as there are strict flying times which contain movements to daylight hours.  

Checking in was simple and friendly. Your are required to produce a credit/debit card on arrival and your account will be immediately charged £40. This will be adjusted (or debited fully in our case) on departure. This varies with other hotels where normally your card details are kept just in case.

Both rooms (ours and our daughters) were large, well appointed and very clean. We could not help but make comparisons with the cabins experienced on cruises that have been taken and here they are very spacious by comparison. The bathroom is not overly large but neither is it cramped. There is a walk in shower of a decent size. Moulton Brown toiletries. the bed was very comfortable and the air conditioning was very effective.

On a bright, sunny, dry day of some 16/18 degrees (excellent for March) our day started with the cross Thames cable car whose station was less than a 10 minute walk from the hotel. Then it was a river clipper trip to the London Eye (impossibly busy) then a walk back along the south bank to Tower Bridge. Tube back to DLR Royal Victoria to check out a couple of restaurants local to the hotel. After supper it was back to the hotel where cocktails were sampled.

After a good nights sleep in a comfy bed it was breakfast time. There was no pressure here so time could be taken for a leisurely breakfast taken from a large choice of fare that was quite well presented, of good quality and well prepared and cooked.

Time for checkout and again easily done.

This was a quality hotel stay and the staff deserves a special mention. Nothing was too much trouble anytime and we treated politely, friendly and made to feel like a customer (the latter can be quite rare these days).

Will be return? Already my wife and I are planning for a return later in the year and this time, without the pressure of children (albeit in their thirties!).",5,2015,03,18
119,Returning customer,Me and the Mrs went there last year for our anniversary and we loved it.   The room was big with plenty of space.  Nice and clean.  The service was amazing.  we would defiantly be going there again and this time try a room with a balcony.,5,2015,03,17
119,Weekend Break,"This is an excellent hotel, everything about it is spotless and service from the staff cannot be faulted. Despite being busy we got an excellent nights sleep every night we were here, no noise from the corridors or other rooms. Coffee machine in the room was a nice touch. Excellent access to Central London from DLR just across the square or via Emirates cable car to Greenwich and then river boats into London.Definitely will be going back.",5,2015,03,17
119,An unusual hotel in a relatively central location,"A luxury hotel located in the Royal Victoria Dock in London, almost opposite the O2 arena. The entrance was very glitzy and the reception staff were really helpful. Our stateroom overlooked the water and had a balcony ( though it was too cold to use on our stay). The cabin was very well appointed and spotlessly clean. Public rooms were also of a high standard and sipping cocktails in the Sundown Bar, looking out towards the cable car and the lights of London, was special. The breakfast had a wide range on offer and was of a reasonable standard, though not 5 star. A luxurious hotel overall, with the addition of an onboard spa treatment facility. The area has several restaurants within walking distance.",4,2015,03,17
119,"""Top Drawer"" Treated us like film stars !","We stayed here for one night in an Executive family room and I must say it ticked all the boxes. The location of the hotel was great as we were going to a concert at the O2 which was the main reason for picking this hotel, also it was a surprise for my wife and daughter ! . All the staff were genuinely friendly towards us and nothing was too much trouble, clean spacious room with modern technology and a great view from our balcony !. We ate at the restaurant and were looked after like film stars, all of the food was beautifully presented and cooked to perfection. It was the same for our breakfast the next day so 10/10 to all of the staff and thanks for making our short stay very memorable. For anyone who is going to travel like us to The O2 it's a short walk to the DLR - docklands light railway! , get on this to Canning Town just 2 stops away then switch to the underground - Jubilee line for North Greenwich - O2. Just to finish my review the Cable Car is worth a trip but try and go when its a sunny day and not too windy !",5,2015,03,17
119,"Luxurious and different,","I stayed last summer and have got it booked in a couple of months. It's a fabulous suite, spacious and something quite different if you've never been on a cruise. Good food, lovely breakfast, great views over docklands. ",5,2015,03,16
119,So much promise so little delivered.,"I recently stayed on the sunborn and found it to lack finess.

The hotel is beautiful but unfortunately no substance. We booked a double room which turned out to be a twin with the beds pushed together and a sheet thrown over. The staff where unpleasant and the management lazy.

We had breakfast each day and each day had to ask for things, ie. Tea, coffee, butter, salt.... On the final day we had breakfast in our room again cereal arrived with no spoons.. At £50 for two breakfasts you'd expect better.

I left dissapointed.",1,2015,03,16
119,Wow,"My husband and I booked this for my 40th birthday and my...was it special. It really is a little slice of luxury. The staff were all so helpful and friendly. A little special gift was offered and accepted gratefully from the staff as a birthday gift. We enjoyed a lovely meal on board (although courses were minutes apart, but due to early booking time, the restaurant was very quiet). We had a cabin with balcony and river view...perfect. Bed very comfy.shower great. One thing.....and I can't believe I will say it....but please, nicer softer toilet roll!! Shame on me.
Everyone should stay here. At least once.",5,2015,03,16
119,Excellent Hotel for Excel,"Stayed here one night as I was at a trade show at Excel.

Location is great for the Excel, service and rooms were excellent.  Bar struggled a bit with the large crowd that night, but I suspect they were overloaded with reps wining and dining clients.
Room was very nice, big TV, very comfy bed, slight noise from ac I couldn't stop, but otherwise excellent.",5,2015,03,16
119,Lovely!,"Went a few weeks for lunchtime drinks so nice and friendly great views.
cant wait to go back in the summer to sit outside with the girls maybe have a spot of lunch, really nice for a treat, defo one for the summer tho!!! :-)",5,2015,03,16
119,Florence,"A really fantastic place to stay if you want the ex cel centre or to get to city air port.
The staff where all excellent smiling away and telling us about all the facilities etc.
We stayed in a standard room which was of a really good size and with lovely little touches we didn't expect. E.g. Coffee machine, tea making facilities.As normal in any hotel we had soft towels and lovely molten brown soaps etc.
All in all superb stay on way to Florence.",5,2015,03,16
119,Well impressed ,"Quality and class through out. Very impressed. Impeccable service, minor issues dealt with minimal fuss. Only negative comment would be that tablet provided should have had longer lead to enable use through out cabin not just one ""naughty corner"" location. ;-)
",5,2015,03,15
119,Best Bed Ever!!,"My boyfriend and I stayed here to celebrate our one year annerversarie and have to say the bed was sooooo comfy - I am actually writing this from it haha! On a serious note these are my opinons
* Parking was easy and about 3 min walk away (£15 Per day) but secure and safe
* Staff are very friendly and very happy to help (Especially Nazma)
* The room was immacualte and cleaned to a high standard 
* Room Service is easy and reasonable
I will deff be arranging for my mum and dad to come here as I recommend the experience - although the only down point is there isn't much to do round here unless here on business  or the excel unless you travel abit -  hence why I'm taking full advantage of this luxurious big bed haha x",5,2015,03,15
119,Yatch Surprise,"My wife booked a room as a birthday surprise for one night. We were upgraded to an executive room for free, we also got some drinks vouchers. The staff was very friendly and helpful, treating the guests by his/her name.
We also had dinner in the restaurant, lovely and tasty food.
It was a real night in a luxury yatch!",5,2015,03,14
119,Great stay while at the Excel sow,"Fabulous location, stayed for two nights while exhibiting at Excel. The staff are so friendly, even remembering names and nothing seemed too much trouble. The ventiliation system in my room was very noisy, but reception brought me down to my room some ear plugs. The bar is comfy and feels like your in your front room. Lovely Molton Brown goodies in the room, which was a nice bonus. My only criticism is that the croissants at breakfast were hard, fresh baked ones would have been much nicer.",4,2015,03,13
119,Wonderful stay,"We have just spent a wonderful night in an amazing and unusual Hotel. We cannot recommend this hotel enough. The whole experience was impressive, the room, bar, restaurant and the staff were all excellent and although we only stayed one night, wished we had booked more. The area is great,right on the doorstep of Excel and a few minutes walk from the cable cars across to the O2 where there are plenty of restaurants. The DLR is minutes away making access to anywhere in London easy. We will definately stay again.",5,2015,03,12
119,Great stay. Would return,"The reviews of Sunborn London are unanimously 5 stars and I can add my 5 star rating to that. 

Whilst the interior of the boat is a little bit overly flashy - all gold taps, flashy chandeliers and pale wood, the attention to detail and the wonderful staff are what makes this floating hotel special.

From the trainee receptionist, Victoria to everybody else we came across; the staff were lovely, customer service focused and only too happy to help.  

Our river view room with balcony was lovely, with plush carpets, complimentary use of robes and Molton Brown toiletries.  We slept really well too.  

Would definitely return.  All in all, a great stay.",5,2015,03,12
119,A bit of a let down,"So we all know this hotel is a boat, yeah? Well that's where the interest ends I'm afraid.

We travel a lot, saw a deal online and thought we'd give it a go .... So ....

We got off the DLR onto Victoria dock rd and nothing but big blue screens (roadworks) not an issue but the Sunborn is not signposted. We walked a 500 yards in one direction ... Nothing ..... A mile back ..... Nothing. Called the hotel and described where we were, told to continue and turn right .... Nothing. Called again told to return to the station and use another exit!! Another long walk still trying to find the none signposted 'you can't miss it yacht' and we made it. No idea where the entrance was and when we did find it we struggled to find reception.

Reception was 'ok'. Tired looking staff who were going through the motions. Wanted to charge us £40 for extras (we declined) and needed iD which we didn't have.

The room was nice but that was it really .... Basic. We have better bedding at home. 

The bar is nice but £5 for 330ml beer is a bit steep! Good quality wine. A bit slow on bar service considering it wasn't that busy.

A good nights sleep and up early which was lucky as much banging and knocking began at 7.30 am (maintenance?).

No breakfast as I just think £19.50 per person is ludicrous .... I have to say, I just felt it was a bit naff really. Over hyped and over expensive.",3,2015,03,11
119,A night in the Docklands,"Checked into The Yacht at the last minute after being at Excel for a Beauty show.
the start to end the experience was pleasurable.
All the staff were so friendly and went out of their way to help.
will definitely go again
Shelby",5,2015,03,11
119,So Impressed - Wonderful stay,Just back from an amazing trip to London and I cannot recommend this hotel enough. Fantastic experience. Make sure you get to the Sunborn (or return trip into the city) by using the clipper and Emirates Cable car. This really added to the overall experience. Want something different and exciting.... stay on the Sunborn with mode of transport being Clipper & Cable. Amazing.,5,2015,03,11
119,"Sunborn. Great position, fantastic rooms and good price","Needing to attend an exhibition at the Excel in London I had already booked rooms with a well known chain close to the centre. Looking for a restaurant nearby to entertain some clients I found Sunborn and then found they also had rooms on board cheaper than the low cost chain I originally booked with. Cancelled the original rooms and booked with Sunborn at a very good rate. It's located on the river next to the Excel so position is ideal, would seriously recommend, the standard rooms are like suites and the restaurant and service top notch, at this price for London it all mounts up to a fantastic experience. Would definately stay again.",5,2015,03,10
119,The Sunborn Yacht Hotel London Excellent!,"What a wonderful experience. We only stayed one night and wish it were for more. From the moment you walk onboard, you're made welcome. The reception staff are very polite and the room was as expected. We took dinner in the restaurant, which was very, very good and not too expensive. All amenities were first class and very clean. We had breakfast in the room and again this was very good value for money and well prepared. On check-out, which at midday is also a welcome time, the clerk noticed that we had been over-charged for the breakfast and adjusted the bill before we had even spotted it.
In Summary;
Great venue
Great service
Great food
Will recommend to anyone.",5,2015,03,10
119,Excellent stay!!,"My husband and I stayed at the Sunborn for a long weekend. We had an absolutely amazing stay and would highly recommend it. We cheekily turned up early at 11am to see if we could leave our bags whilst we walked around London and not only were the staff more than welcome but they also advised us that our room was ready and we were able to check in. We did not eat in the restaurant but definitely feel we missed out as the menu looked very good,so when we stay next time will definitely have a meal too!! Bar lovely and nice to be able to have a drink on deck and take in the lovely sky line, staff very accomodating. Yacht and rooms exceptionally clean. Could not fault this hotel and will definitely be returning with our son soon!!!",5,2015,03,10
119,WANT TO GO BACK SOON,"we were welcomed on arrival with open arms by claudio which made the start of the experience at sunborn an unforgettable one nazma was also exceptionally friendly helpful and fun and most of all very welcoming we stayed as a treat for my friends birthday and was upgraded to another room which was a nice surprise we had an absolutely wonderful time we had treatments in the spa also dinner on board one evening fabulous food and all the staff were very attentive it made you feel very special
a huge thank you all for making a birthday treat such a special one we both cannot wait to come and stay again very soon xx",5,2015,03,10
119,Surprise treat,"Had a night on here as a birthday present.
Very impressive as you approach the yacht - really looks the business.
Very plush inside although I would say perhaps the bar area looking a little dated
Service very good - bit of a wait in the bar but everywhere else was fine. 
Rooms are very large and very quiet.
A bit disappointed we couldn't have a look around more as your key card keeps you to your floor. 
Overall a nice luxury treat and of course we'll placed for visiting West end.",5,2015,03,10
119,All aboard for a great experience,"in looking for something different I am so pleased this flagged up as a suggestion for a hotel near the O2.
The pictures grab your attention and you often wonder if it will do it justice, I mean after all... This is a floating hotel on the Thames.
Well look no further,
This hotel/ship is absolutely stunning in every aspect,
If you are visiting the O2 or Excel this is the biggest no brainer of all time
The taxi driver at St Pancras hadn't heard of the hotel so you have to say Excel Marina and go for it.
Your first impression when you get dropped off is a WOW moment,
You can't wait to get on board
Entry via a dockside lift takes you straight to reception where you are greeted with the best trained, friendliest, informative, courteous staff I have encountered in a long time ( Mital & Sandra)
We were then joined by Romao who introduced himself as the Reception Shiftleader, he spoke with such pride about the hotel and his enthusiasm was obvious.
The bar & lounge is spacious, the weather prevented us from enjoying our drinks on the outside decking but I'm sure this space in summer is the most popular part of the ship,
The rooms are immaculately clean, the quality of the fitting in the room and bathroom are excellent,
The bed and pillows luxurious, 
We didn't have dinner on board due to attending the O2 Country 2 Country but enjoyed a couple of fabulous breakfasts (including herbed mushrooms that melted in your mouth).... The only item I would improve on the breakfast is the quality of the coffee.
Service was again with a smile from staff who obviously enjoy their working environment.
I would not hesitate in recommending you this hotel, 
We can't wait to go back .... Hopefully in the sunshine (if it's not fully booked)
Don't waste a moment and try this for yourself
""All Aboard""

119,Good service and friendly staff.,"This was our second visit to Sunborn London. Our first was during the hotel's 'soft' opening last year. During that visit, there were a few minor problems. 
The company has addressed these well and we were very happy with our visit in March 2015. 
All of the staff were friendly and helpful, and seemed to genuinely want every visitor to have a great stay.",5,2015,03,10
119,The Sunborn  Yacht Hotel London,"This experience was amazing, we stayed here for the C2C @ O2 wow...... A stones throw literally from the venue, we got the Emirates Sky line (right next door to the yacht) which dropped us into the O2!!, location, location, location - couldn't be better! 
The hotel is truly spectacular, the yacht is immaculately clean (trust me I'm fussy), the attention to detail is outstanding,  the staff are always on hand and nothing is too much bother! On check in the receptionist enquired of our day, we told her we had tickets for the O2 for the evening and were getting a taxi  back, we were promptly handed a card advising us to ring the yacht  and they would make arrangements to have a taxi car collect us outside the O2 after the show!!! Nothing was too much trouble!! All the staff are utterly charming, and they actually look happy to be at work, unlike some hotels! we did not have dinner on the yacht but did stay for breakfast the next morning and true to Sunborns exacting standards the breakfast was quite  possibly without doubt the best breakfast in London (organic bacon)! The beds are also super comfortable, amenities are Molton Brown (nice touch) and each room also has a Sony Tablet .... Free to use with free WIFI,  Great experience, we will most definitely be back to try the restaurant and spa.... My new favourite London Hotel, thank you Sunborn 😀",5,2015,03,09
119,Excellent  ,Stayed overnight in a family room with our 9 year old. The room was  big enough for the three of us with coffee and electrical to enjoy. Excellent staff and service. Breakfast good value and super location for the O2. Highly recommended . ,5,2015,03,09
119,Superb service,"we were visiting the Ecobuild Show at the ExCel, we travelled from Glasgow to London on the overnight train which you can never get a good nights sleep, we arrived tired and ready for a shower to freshen up and head to the show.
unfortunately due to a mix-up on the booking site which had defaulted to the Sunborn Gibraltar site, we had ended up booked into the Gibraltar hotel.
I explained that I had selected the London hotel from the drop-down menu and duly filled in the information to book a nice big cabin with balcony and view over the river.
the staff were extremely friendly and after a short talk with the hotel manager. we were supplied with the same beautiful cabin with balcony and breakfast included for the same price we had booked on the Gibraltar site. a saving of over £100.
I cannot say enough about the level of service in this hotel and the beautiful rooms.

We thoroughly enjoyed our stay and will go back if we are ever back in that neck of the woods.",5,2015,03,09
119,An amazing hotel/ship,"My boyfriend and I had a lovely stay at this hotel! It's worth the money! Beatiful rooms, space and in the right location if you are going to a gig at the O2 areana! The Spa massage was great! Staff helpful and smiling! Defiantly worth spending a little bit extra to make the whole expectance worth while!",5,2015,03,09
119,Very impressed,"I'm working at the Excel all week which makes this hotel is handy as it is literally a stones throw away. I was checking in early (11.30am) and was thrilled to be told the room was not only ready but i had been upgraded to a deluxe room with river view. The room is large and comfortable with a desk, a balcony (overlooking the thames with O2 arena as the view!) and has all the mod cons along free wifi which is a definate plus when staying away with business.  First impressions are very good and well done to Sandra, Mital and Claudio on front desk for their top class service.",5,2015,03,09
119,Sunborn in the sunshine,"I booked one night as a surprise for my husband's 60th birthday and he was thrilled. 
I was disappointed that we were given a room dockside as I had paid for an exec room and had advised that it was a special occasion but the staff were very helpful in relocating  us to river view and a lovely balcony room. The food for lunch,and dinner  was excellent but I have had much better breakfasts in other hotels. It was a little annoying to be presented with a full bill when I had prepaid for the evening meal but again thus was quickly sorted out by the  efficient reception manager I would certainly  like to return for another stay .",4,2015,03,08
119,Romantic Yacht in London!,"We stayed overnight on the fab yacht located on
the banks of the Thames
The Cabins were really spacious and well designed.
Large beds and lots of wardrobe space.Large shower and great 
white bath towels.

You take a lift to the reception area which is quite quirky,the yacht is very well laid out and it has a spectacular staircase together with the decor throughout
is really lavish.

We had an evening meal in the restaurant and had a window seat that overlooked the city which was lovely,the meal was really nice,although could have been a bit warmer,but delicious anyway.

One thing we would like to say is that ALL the staff are absolutely great,no matter who you spoke too they gave their undivided attention and made you feel really special so well done all you guys.

This was a present from our children which made it very special for us and would love to go back and have a couple of days on board!

We also went on the cable car which takes you to the O2 great little trip worth a try.",5,2015,03,08
119,For a touch of class and elegance stay at the sunborn,birthday treat for my two daughters.staff were amazing and nothing was too much trouble for them the ship was spotless and the food must be close to Michelin star quality and considering your in london not badly priced. I will certainly staying here again. ,5,2015,03,08
119,First Visit,"My boyfriend and I stayed at the Sunborn London Yacht Hotel for one night.  When we arrived we was served by Nazma who was very friendly. She asked if it was for an occasion and when we mentioned our anniversary Nazma upgraded us to a Balcony River View and gave us 2 50% off drinks voucher which was a nice touch.

The food at breakfast was to a very high standard and reasonably priced at £12.50 each for all you can eat buffet.

Would recommend this hotel.",4,2015,03,08
119,"Fantastic Concept, Brilliantly Executed!","I was attending an exhibition at Excel and my girlfriend was joining me for the evening so I came across this hotel and was intrigued by the concept.

I arrived in the morning before the start of my exhibition had a few drinks with colleagues at the hotel bar and dropped my luggage off. I was informed my room wasn't ready yet (check in was at 3pm, I had arrived at 10am) but they had been able to offer me a complimentary upgrade (as per my request) as one was available.

The staff in the morning at the bar and reception were very polite and informative as well as friendly. Claudio was very kind and attentive in particular!

I returned to the hotel that evening after the exhibition to be directed to my room where my bags were already waiting. I had room 4038, which was on the 4th deck and overlooked the water and offered views of the O2. The room was clean and well presented, with a balcony and coffee machine which I enjoyed together the following morning!!

Breakfast was charged at £19.50 pp so a bit expensive, however there was a great selection of good quality food and the views complimented the breakfast perfectly. We enjoyed a good hour overlooking the water and ended up skipping lunch as a result of over indulgence!

The O2 is easily reached via the Emirates skyline service (about 10mins walk) and there is a tesco extra for convenience only 5mins away too!

For access to the excel, you cannot fault it, being as close to the exhibition as the station, literally 2mins away!

I only stayed for 1 night, however will gladly return as all staff were so polite and friendly and the overall stay represented great value for money! I booked in advance and got a good price at £120 on a Thursday night.

Again a kind mention to Claudio in particular for ensuring our stay was that little bit extra special!

See you again soon!",5,2015,03,08
119,"Glitzy and glam, loved it!","We stayed the night to celebrate my husband's birthday, and were lucky enough to be upgraded to a top deck room with a balcony. He was also given a voucher to use at the cocktail bar. How kind. We absolutely loved it. With beautiful fittings and finishing, the room felt nautical enough to be fun and different but not cramped or 'cabin fever'ish! 

We didn't eat on the Sunborn but used the bar which was lovely, I can recommend the Pontoon Dock cocktail! Staff were all lovely, smiley and helpful. The reception area is beautiful. Breakfast was plentiful and we sat right by the rear windows of the yacht, so were able to enjoy the fab views of the river, the Emirates cable car and the O2! 

Alll in all a really wonderful stay, I think this is my new favourite hotel in London!",5,2015,03,07
119,FIRST CLASS WITH SUPERIOR CUSTOMER SERVICE,"Yet another fantastic stay. My wife and I went to celebrate my 50th Bday. Every effort was made to make us feel special and extremly well looked after. We even got a free upgrade to an exec room with a balcony. During the stay some of my family joined us for a meal on the Yatch, once again brilliant service and very nice food and for a top restaurant, not to expensive.",5,2015,03,07
119,Exceeded our expectations,"Stayed last Saturday in February for my wifes birthday. Experience was outstanding from start to finish. Reception staff very friendly and allowed early check in, room was larger than expected and to good specification with sofa included, good for relaxing. We had lunch with family in bar and food was to good standard and again good service. The yacht was impressive, exceeded our expectations, will stay again.",5,2015,03,06
119,Terrible breakfast but very comfortable beds!,"Even for London, with advance booking discount at £150 exc. breakfast and an incredibly comfortable bed this is not the best value.  Rooms are well proportioned and clean albeit the bathroom is compact.

We decided to pay am extra £19.90 per head for breakfast and while our concerns were listened to and the bill cut to £8 per head for the tea and toast we did manage to consume it is not good enough.

Bacon should be cooked or at very least the stodgy fat cut off, there should be more than scrapings in the egg dish and the tea looked and tasted like pond water.  

To make matters worse the rather gormless waiting staff decided it would be a good idea to start setting up a table for 8 extremely loud salesmen attending the exhibition nearby.  This completely hemmed us in and caused much shuffling and inconvenience for all concerned to reach the meagre offerings on the breakfast buffet tables!

This yacht hotel from a distance looks wonderful but up close and once on board the decor is showing itself to be of poor workmanship and very tired.  The veneer was coming away in a number of places on the internal walls in the restaurant adding to an air of shabbiness.

It could be fantastic such a pity that another hotel in London feels it can get away with such low standards.",3,2015,03,04
119,Great hotel,"Makes you fee that bit more special, particularly a room with a balcony and river view.  Great food reasonably priced, will stay there again.  The tablet in the room was a nice touch as was the Lavazza coffee maker",5,2015,03,04
119,WHY NOT SLEEP AT THE YACHT CLUB?,"We landed at London City airport and took a Taxi to the Sunborn Yacht Club. The yacht is docked permanently and the inside/outside looks just like a small cruise ship. The cost per night is very reasonable and they offer some specials which include dinner. We didn't venture off the yacht due to inclement weather. We ate lunch and dinner on board and it was quite nice.  Ruben was our super waiter and has been ""on board "" sine the ship opened.  I can see that there must be many. Anniversary parties and weddings here. You can enjoy a room facing the Themes or  facing land. 
The showers were of nice size compared to normal ships.",5,2015,03,04
119,Amazing.....but please don't tell everyone!,"Having stayed on a number of occasions over the past month - and with plans to stay over the next few months - this hotel is amazing in every aspect....with the added uniqueness of bing a boat.

Cannot recommend highly enough - from the rooms (even the smallest are huge for London), the service and the food.

.....but please don't tell everyone as I'd like to be able to get a reservation again!!!",5,2015,03,04
119,Disappointed,"Beautiful hotel, lovely nearby resteraunts, comfortable room and great views. I feel no choice but to give a bad review dispite this, purely because I accidently left my phone in the room, called back as soon as we left and the phone has never been found. I just feel so disappointed that there's no other explaination than a member of staff had taken the phone. Left a bit of a bad taste in my mouth, and it's such a shame to say but I wouldn't revisit purely for this reason.",1,2015,03,03
119,Different,"stayed here on business for 2 days. The hotel is a little dated and reminded me of a cruise I went on as a boy in the 80's with my parents. The staff were excellent, very polite, helpful and served with a smile. I ate breakfast which was very good, lots of choice and I had room service in the evening. The menu isn't extensive but the food was hot and very tasty.",4,2015,03,03
119,We’re glad we’ve tried it…,"Stayed for one night on the Sunborn Yacht and overall it was a very good experience.  Our cabin was lovely, very plush.  The bed was comfortable, nice toiletries and big fluffy towels in the bathroom and we enjoyed the coffee maker.  We paid extra for a balcony which was very nice but far too cold to stay out there for any length of time, but we enjoyed the river view!

I was disappointed with the restaurant.  It wasn’t the romantic setting I’d hoped for – very harsh lighting and what didn’t help (and this is just down to timing) was that there were 2 very big parties in so the cacophony of voices, children shouting, babies crying, people up and down bashing the back of my chair, to gather round their table for photos… none of this added to the romantic ambience that our Ultimate Romance Package had suggested!!  

The food was only ok… I wouldn’t eat there again.  Sometimes you are presented with a menu where none of the choices appeal and this was one of those moments. But the service is impeccable, the staff are extremely efficient and do their jobs excellently and should be praised for that. 

So as a hotel stay it was first class, as a dining experience it was not for us.",4,2015,03,03
119,"Fantastic place to stay for O2, Excel etc..","Stayed here for one night for a concert at the O2. Very impressed! went for the standard room, but it was huge..would be a suite in many London hotels. Huge and comfortable bed, nice seating area, good bathroom (not huge, but everything worked well). Breakfast was a lovey buffet in the restaurant with views down the dock towards O2 and London skyline. Will definitely be back.",5,2015,03,03
119,"Not just a hotel, an experience.","The sunborn offers a completely new world of accommodation, from start to finish.  The warm and royal like welcome from the front of house is the first moment you realise you are aboard the super yacht.  The incredibly regal decor, a dashing stairway hung chandelier giving a titanic feel to the reception and a classy lift up to the entrance. All of the staff are friendly and personal, remembering guests names and very professional, one of them I particularly remember was someone called Hugo, a very accommodating gentleman. 
The rooms are very open, spacious and modern however you can tell where you are as there are elements of originality, with subtle hints of the ships original decor making it feel like your are in a luxury cabin. I would definitely recommend a room with a balcony as it offers a lovely view over the docklands. The restaurant is fantastic, very relaxed yet has a savvy buzz of atmosphere in the evening.  The lamb dish I had was quite frankly stunning! I do think the white wine selection could offer a little more variety, missing vital wines like a New Zealand Marlborough Sauvignon, perfect with fish.  The red wine selection does offer variety and we had an excellent Malbec he hitch was an incredible accompaniment to the lamb.
Breakfast is first class, and the staff were 'all hands on deck' when I ordered something that wasn't on the menu, providing what I had asked for within minutes. The view, again, overlooking the skyline of London....absolutely awesome.
The sunborn, for me is the perfect for business or pleasure, situated right next to the excel and easy access through rail.  I certainly recommends staying there and give top marks in all sectors. If you want to feel special, this is for you. Different, fun, professional, up market, unique and enjoyable. Will 100% be returning. Thank you!",5,2015,03,02
119,"superb yacht, great location 5☆☆☆☆☆+","Wow, what a great weekend we had, superb yacht, staff were excellent, nothing was ever too much. We only eat breakfast whilst there, but again that was excellent.  Rooms overlooking the water are well worth the extra money. We had a room upgrade as it was my wife's birthday.  We will definitely be back there.....thanks to all the staff for making it a great weekend... ",5,2015,03,02
119,Lovely weekend stay,"Just returned from a lovely relaxing stay on the Sunborn Yacht hotel. The hotel is in a good location just a few minutes walk from the DLR Excel stop. We ate in the restaurant on the first night and the food and service was good. The staff are all very friendly and helpful.
We spent the Saturday at the O2, getting there via the Emirates Skyline which is just a short walk away and very reasonably priced.
All in all a nice way to spend a weekend.",5,2015,03,02
119,Perfect,"My partner and I stayed here on sat 28th feb. We arrived early as we phoned ahead and asked if they could hold our luggage.the reception staff were just lovely,so friendly and welcoming and told us our room was ready so we went straight to it. The room was simply lovely.so comfortable and spacious and luxurious. After spending the day in London we returned early evening and dressed for drinks in the bar. What a lovely relaxed atmosphere.we didn't eat here as we had eaten in central London earlier. We just relaxed in the comfortable surroundings and admired the view. All the staff are attentive and friendly. The whole experience was a brilliant one and would highly recommend. The bed was Prob one of the most comfy I've slept in and with a free to use coffee machine, mini fridge,iron and ironing board,complimentary robe you want for nothing. A lovely bathroom and shower.massive mirrors everywhere and a free to use tablet.a wonderful experience all round:-)) ",5,2015,03,02
119,Not a sailor in sight!,"This yacht hotel (with no engine) is moored at Royal Victoria Dock in East London near the ExCel exhibition centre and across the water to the 02 venue which is easily reached using the nearby cross-Thames cable car.
The pre-booked dinner with a glass of champagne was excellent and the service was first class.
Our room was large and airy with a balcony overlooking the water and the lights of Canary Wharf.",5,2015,03,02
119,Mrs,"Had a lovely night away for my Husbands Birthday.  Very attentive staff, nothing too much trouble. We had the set menu with a glass of champagne which was excellent. Would highly recommend the Sunborn of you wanted something a little different. Hope to go back. ",5,2015,03,01
119,1 night stop over,"We had been told about this hotel by a couple we know who had stayed there. 
We had an evening planned in town so booked a room. 
It is easy to locate as the DLR runs directly to excel. 
We checked in quite late with the intention of going back out. We didn't in the end as the bar and surrounding company and staff were as good as anything we could have gone out for. 
A very pleasant evening. Lovely room with a balcony. 
Excellent breakfast.",5,2015,03,01
119,amazing,stayed at sunborn for my birthday and was not disappointed staff good restaurant lovely got free upgrade couldn't fault nothing better than them poncy west end rip offs if you want something different this is it,5,2015,02,28
119,A magical experience....,"Simply everything about our stay was superb. I was visiting the Excel for an exhibition and my wife came along for a leisure break.  
We had the most magical evening in the restaurant with a view looking out on to the water. The set menu was not only delicious but just amazing value. Congratulations to the staff and management for their welcome, warmth and high standard of professionalism.  We cannot recommend it enough. Brilliant!",5,2015,02,28
119,A Novelty Hotel,"It's not very day of the week that you board a hotel that is a ship moored in the Thames. From the outside the Seabourn is impressive, suggesting an air of luxury on board. It never quite lives up to that expectation and resembles a Holiday Inn in many regards,  but is none the worse for that. We stayed in a standard river facing cabin/room which was spacious and had everything you need for a short stay. Bathrooms are yacht size small with a shower but no bath in our case. The breakfast was very good, with attentive staff and a room with a view of the O2. No complaints there. Location-wise, the Seabourn is a 10 minutes walk to the Emirates gondola, so a further 10 minutes ride to the O2, and is highly recommended if you are visiting the O2- much better than some of the more expensive faceless hotels South of the river. It is also next door to the Excel centre. The only gripe was that the check in and check out experiences were diabolically bad - partly due to the fact that we had booked 6 rooms but partly through incompetency on the part of the hotel. Despite that, the novelty value and location score highly and we would stay again.",4,2015,02,28
119,Great Experience,"Stayed there before which was very average, but this time was much much better, customer service was good with friendly and helpful staff (well done ISS). It has a good relaxed atmosphere and a little different than your normal hotel experience. The location is good and ideal for London and plenty of restaurants nearby.",5,2015,02,27
119,Amazing!,Me and my partner stayed at this amazing hotel last night for his birthday and truely was everything and more! The staff were all so friendly and welcoming. Only fault in our stay was that our air con was not working and we had to go to ask for help in the middle of the night as we was unable to sleep but the problem was quickly resolved and was also given a complimary breakfast. My boyfriend had am amazing night and a very memorable birthday! Also the pure elegance of the reception area is breath-taking . So worth the money! ,5,2015,02,27
119,"Brilliant, Fantastic, A Must","We stayed here for a couple of nights this week and we wish it was more.  One night will only leave you wanting more as does 2 so if you can push the boat out (sorry about the pun) go for it :).
The crew are absolutely fantastic and a credit to the company especially Appo.  The whole place can only be described as brilliant, and from my experience has been better then any of the 5* properties we have ever stayed in.
The rooms are extremely spacious and well kitted out even to the point where a tablet is provided for you to surf the net.
we stayed in a basic cabin but I loved it so much i booked it again before we checked out.

If you eat on board it is quite expensive but you can find many local restaurants doing great food at great prices if you wish to venture

Well done Sunborn for getting it sooooooo right

PS pillows very comfy but not my forte for sleeping on :(",5,2015,02,27
119,The love boat...,"We stayed for just one night to celebrate my wife's birthday.  When we arrived we discovered we'd been given a complimentary upgrade to a room with a river view (had we not I may well have page the extra £70 anyway as the view from the dockside would have been considerably less impressive!) which was a lovely surprise as was the room itself which was spacious and very comfortable). To be honest, unless you were specifically staying to visit an event at the Excel centre which is literally just opposite the Sunborn the area itself is somewhat spartan with just a few places to eat and drink but there was a pedestrian bridge which gives a good view of the yacht and general area and the trolly car which gives fantastic views of some of the icon London landmarks is just a few minutes walk away). As for the Sunborn itself... The interior is quite impressive, especially the staircases and we enjoyed an excellent meal in the restaurant which, like the bar, offered romantic night views which really made our visit special.  Staff were friendly and courteous and we would definitely stay there again (we have signed up for the Excel events mailing to give us an excuse for another stay!). ",5,2015,02,27
119,Truly special ,"Stayed at the yacht for a night
We were offered a free upgrade as a lovely welcome and quickly checked in.

We had really nice views and the room spacious and had all mod cons. Couldn't fault it.

The bar has great views if canary wharf and the cable cars to Greenwich Village. 

The restaurant and bar are quite pricey but is was such special view and so romantic I would say is definitely worth it.
",5,2015,02,26
119,Exceeded our expectations on all levels.,Only spent one night in the Hotel which we chose due to its location to the O2. I have to say that from check-in to check out our experience was delightful. The hotel certainly has the wow factor. Staff were extremely well trained and friendly. Rooms very spacious and spotlessly clean. All of the little extras were very much appreciated. We would without hesitation stay again and again!! Rooms are far superior to Cunards cabins.,5,2015,02,26
119,Almost a Cruise,"My wife and I have just returned from a nights stay at the Sunborn. I really enjoyed myself and thought the room and facilities were excellent. We had a Thames view room and it was well worth the extra money. The staff were all helpful, but I must mention Nazma from reception, what a lovely young lady she is. Its the warm and friendly greeting we received at check in that set the mood for the stay. Well done to all at the hotel and look forward to my next stay with you.",5,2015,02,26
119,"Fantastic night, would recommend!","My husband booked the Sunborn hotel for my birthday surprise. It was very well organised all thanks to Micheal! 
We had a wonderful experience. The room was lovely, the restaurant and food were superb (thank you Raul) and the staff were very friendly. 
We will surely be visiting again. ",5,2015,02,25
119,Reasonable. ,"The sunborn is a lovely hotel and as you know. It's on a boat! That's about it. 

As hotels go it's nothing special. Its clean. Tidy. Very up to date all as you would expect however there is just nothing special about it. 

I wouldn't stay again. Not because it's terrible but because there is nothing special what so ever about it. ",3,2015,02,25
119,Amaze balls!!,"Stayed there with my friend for a night for a staycation. 
We were greeted by the super helpful Mariyom (sp)? She checked us with in record time and we even got a free upgrade. 

The bar was really lively and the food was great.
The rooms were very clean and beautiful and room service was prompt. 

Would stay here again in a heartbeat. 

",5,2015,02,25
119,A brilliant stay,"We stayed as a familly of 4 in two rooms at the ynborn London betwen 15 - 18 Feb, the staff were really accommodating in making sure we had two rooms together. The rooms were very spacious and exceptionally clean. The entrance to the hotel was very impressive. We we primarily staying to do some siteseeing around London and the proximity to the DLR was really useful as was the fact that the Emirates Airway cable car to the O2 was a two minute walk along the dock side. There are also a number of restaurants very close by and a couple of mini supermarkets within walking distance. For those who need the WIFI connection it was superfast unlike some places that restrict you to very low bandwidth. I will definitely be staying again!",5,2015,02,25
119,Wonderful experience with the family.,"My wife and two girls spent a night aboard the hotel and we all loved the experience. The girls loved the idea of spending a night on a boat and none of us were disappointed. The cabin had all we required, the staff more than helpful, the views are stunning at night whilst relaxing in the bar, and with as much as you could eat from the breakfast buffet we were more than spoilt. Would recommend both as a family or adult experience. ",5,2015,02,24
119,Fantastic staff!,"We stayed on the Sunborn for two nights. We travelled with our 5 year old, who became unwell whilst there. ALL the staff were friendly and welcoming, and made us all feel very welcome. There wasn't anything that was too much to ask of them. When they were aware that our child was unwell, they offered us a later check out so that we weren't rushed - brilliant! Just what we needed.",4,2015,02,24
119,A little touch of heaven,"We stayed at the Sunborn for a mid week break, very easy access from the DLR and just a short trip on the jubilee line into the city.
I was very surprised with the quality of the hotel for the price we payed. Rooms where large and with quality amenities, offering great views across London.
The staff where friendly and always happy to help with any queries, all in all a really excellent stay thank you Sunborn London.",5,2015,02,24
119,New Concept Hotel,I spent a long weekend in this new hotel. Was really exiting to stay in a luxury yacht fixed in the Dockland area from London. Very close to the city center with the underground and behind to the O2 arena. Rooms are very big and very confortable. Bar and breakfast room have views to the river.,5,2015,02,23
119,Sleepover with a view,"Stayed at the Sunborn for a night with my friend. It was a last minute decision to treat ourselves as to a sleepover in a hotel and so we booked a few hours before we checked in. Maryiam welcomed us with such lovely smile and patience, offered to take photos of us and we stayed in room 5038 on the 5th floor. 

We had a whole deck to ourselves, and a sitting/dinning area attached to the room. It was amazing watching the sun rise from the balcony. Breakfast was good, the cocktails were even better.

I'll definitely return and most likely stay longer than a night.",5,2015,02,23
119,Better than a hotel,"A delight to have tried this floating yacht. The price was good. Free wifi and a Sony tablet in the room with games on it which was a nice touch. Glasses provided in addition to the pay for mini bar (expensive mini bar) but bring your own drinks and wine glasses are available. Nice seating area Nd great views. If going to the O2 don't try and walk, do your research. Take a cable car or a taxi. There is no direct rout. It's not as close as it looked due to being covered by water.  Try this place if you are going to the excel. Lush accommodation.",5,2015,02,22
119,Wonderful weekend away,"I book this hotel as a surprise for my partner for our anniversary. Hotel is in an excellent location, and it's a little different being on a ship. Inside is beautiful and grand. We was greeted by the lovely reception staff and she was very helpful and friendly. I had mentioned prior to our stay, that we were there to celebrate our anniversary I was expecting anything but we was then greeted my the general manager who wanted to offer any extra way to make our stay special. We were given free drinks at the bar and looked after by all the staff. The rooms were comfy and grand. The bed was like sleeping on a cloud. We stayed for breakfast so we could experience everything hotel had to offer. Food was delicious with a varied variety and catered to all needs. The views from the restaurant were beautiful you could imagine you was in the middle of the ocean. We can't wait to stay again.",5,2015,02,22
119,Pure class,"We stayed at sunborn for my birthday weekend and I was pleasantly surprised at how good our experience was. 
The floating hotel was very well priced and the customer service is good.
The cabins are very luxurious overall I cannot praise it enough.
Well done to the owners who decided to place a large cruise ship in the Thames. We will most definitely be stayed again",5,2015,02,22
119,luxury!,"Travelled into London for my boyfriends birthday, the room was absolutely lovely with a huge bed a balcony and good facilities. Went for dinner at the restaurant the food was incredible along with wonderful service from staff, the only fault I have is that there was a private party upstairs and the music was very loud which slightly spoiled the atmosphere. But I would still visit again!",5,2015,02,21
119,excellent stay,Just returned from a two night stay on board what a lovelly place to stay big clean rooms and friendly helpful staff . the only thing I might say against it is the prices of the drinks way to expensive even at London standards maybe a bit more choice of larger/beers but if that's all there is to moan about then you will love this boat,5,2015,02,21
119,Didn't want to leave AMAZING!!!!,"Having just today departed from room 1023 I cannot express what a wonderful break we have had aboard the sunborn, I would go as far as saying this is the The best hotel we have ever stayed in, we really didn't want to leave. The rooms were immaculate beds the most comfortable I have ever slept in,comfy sofas  fantastic power 
showers. We only ate breakfast on board but it was wonderful, every thing from fresh fruits to pastries, cheeses, cured meats, salmon and of course full English breakfast, oh the 
mushrooms where amazing. we could of sat there all morning taking in the 
views of london in front of us. The staff were wonderful nothing ever seemed too much trouble they were well mannered and extremely polite and 
friendly, I cannot recommend the sunborn high enough, we have had an incredible stay with you and can't wait to return soon, thank you to everyone on board for making our break so 
special  jo pitts     ",5,2015,02,21
119,Great find!,"We stayed at the sunborn yacht hotel for the BabyShow 2015. With two small children and on my own I needed something close by and I received an excellent rate. The children were so excited to stay onboard, arriving from ExCeL they literally squealed with excitement at the sight of the impressive boat moored next to the venue. The staff were very welcoming, spacious family room, super comfy beds, excellent shower and amazing fluffy white towels. Lots of lovely Molton Brown goodies and fab in-room Lavazza coffee machine. Breakfast with views of London a bonus. Big thumbs up from all of us. Thank you! ",5,2015,02,20
119,Excellent experience,"Went here for Valentines weekend and could not be more pleased with the overall experience.  The room was spacious and immaculate with good facilties and we booked the special Valentine dinner event, which was just brilliant.  Superb food, really attentive, but not intrusive staff and overall made to feel really special.  I must give a special mention to Nazma on reception who checked us in and checked us out and had the unique ability to make you feel like you are the most important guest in the Hotel.",5,2015,02,20
119,A truly awesome experience,"This is a place of real quality and superb customer service. I proposed to my girlfriend on the yacht, everything about this hotel is perfect. As soon as entered, I knew I had found the perfect venue, I even went to get a refund on the deposit I had made at nearby restaurant!

I had an elaborate proposal plan involving family & friends and needed to use various rooms and areas of the yacht. The events team were more than happy to cater to my every request, I really could not have done it without the help of Hugo and the team. if your dealing with them, just know that you're in good hands. Their customer service is second to none. 

I have no reservations recommending this Hotel, the unique appeal of the hotel on the water, coupled with the excellent service makes it a winner. I'm looking forward to returning here after the wedding (she said yes)!

119,Lovely yacht - good wxperi,"Stayed at Sunborn London for one night in February 2015. This was an amazing experience. Decor is beautiful and lobby area was very spacious. Nearest DLR station to get there is CUSTOM HOUSE and only a 5 min walk away.

The view of Canary Wharf at night was outstanding. There are a few restaurants nearby.

The room was huge. Very good shower and tea/coffee making facilities. Wifi was also very good- had no problems. Staff were were pleasant and attentive.

Overall we had a very good experience and would return ",5,2015,02,19
119,Close to Excel and wonderful experience,"We stayed at Sunborn when visiting the Excel.  We received a friendly but professional welcome and received a complimentary room upgrade and the room was large, clean and with good quality furnishings.  Room facilities were good and the bed was comfortable  We were on a package including dinner and the meal in the restaurant was excellent - great food and a terrific view over Victoria Dock.  Its very convenient for Excel and a very enjoyable experience.",5,2015,02,19
119,Lovely Boat with lovely smiling staff!,"We stayed my boyfriend for business and pleasure! Our Check-in and check-out were fabulous, with a very helpul, friendly and multicultural staff. nothing to fault, good value for money... apart from the expensive and overpriced drink at the bar! get your own bottle! we will recommend this hotel and will try to visit the one in Gilbratar!",4,2015,02,18
119,Special yacht hotel:),"I stayed here with my friend for two nights.We really liked the hotel,it is very special something else..The room was lovely and clean with a big balcony,we had a great view over the river:)The staff were very nice,helpful  and attentive at the reception but the bartenders were very slow and unkind!We had to wait ages for two cocktails and our food were cold when we got them!They really need to work on it!
Anyway I would recommend this hotel  if you look for something special:)
",4,2015,02,18
119,"Lovely, different hotel","My girlfriend and I recently stayed at the Sunborn. It was an excellent, unique hotel, which made it more appealing to both of us. We were granted an early check-in to our lovely, spacious room, which was a bonus, and although we had things planned, the staff were very helpful with suggestions or answering any questions we did have! The bathroom was a little small but that didn't really matter, and the view overlooking the water was really special.",4,2015,02,17
119,Amazing anniversary treat,"My boyfriend & I stayed here for our anniversary on 2nd January. Although it is a bit far out and it is a bit of a trek to get too from the London main train stations, it is definitely worth it. As soon as we walked in to the hotel, we loved it. It is extremely secure, needing keys to get in and out of all floors of the hotel including the lift. 
The hotel was very quiet which was nice, and the room was a big size and we were very impressed with our stay. The bed was extremely comfortable and although the bathroom was a usual yacht size, it was perfect for us.
The hotel staff provided us with some cocktail vouchers as it was our anniversary which we appreciated. We sat in the bar for these before heading over to the Shard for dinner. The hotel had booked us a chauffer driven car to take us there. The view from the bar in the hotel was lovely & we were thoroughly impressed with our whole stay. 

Highly recommended and we would love to stay here again!",5,2015,02,17
119,Amazing Break Away!,"We absolutely love this unique hotel. The staff make you feel very special. They can't do enough for you, from the receptionist to house keeping. Upon arrival we were very pleased to hear that we were being upgraded from a Classic Room to an Executive Room. Which pleased us as we were going to upgrade anyway.
The room featured a balcony, a must for this hotel. Sat on the balcony with views over the dock and skyline is an amazing sight, especially at night!
The room is very plush, clean and tidy as you'd expect. Lovely bathroom. The whole yacht is very grand.
Lyndsey from housekeeping was lovely, offering to take photos of us. Wishing us a pleasant stay. Extremely friendly member of staff. 
A must if you want something different from the norm!",5,2015,02,16
119,Unique & Wonderful Hotel,"Booked for my sons birthday & after previously emailing in hope of a cheeky upgrade was very pleased upon check in to see that my request had been honoured - 2 x river facing executive rooms.
 Beautiful reception and I don't think it is dated at all - very glitzy, maybe a bit on the bling side - all gold and polished wood! but after travelling on the QM2 to New York I think this is just the style yachts & ships etc go for and the cabins were 100% better than on QM2! it would look weird if all in minimalistic IKEA type styling so I loved it! you notice the place is sparkling clean and even smells wonderful in the corridors - very spa like.
Anyway what do you need to know and need from a hotel;-
Firstly a good night sleep - Tick (only ever had a more comfortable hotel bed and that was in Egypt)
Cost - big tick was cheaper than Premier Inn on booking.com
Good Shower - Tick easy to work, plenty of hot water & lovely towels and Molton Brown toiletries.
Peaceful - big tick never heard anyone else so soundproofing most be amazing as you are actually almost on the London City Airport runway!
Great breakfast - full english, cereal, fruit, cheeses even salmon but it is £20 which personally is steep for me but was wonderful for a treat (mushrooms were amazing) would suggest Fox Inn 2 min away for cheap alternative to eat/drink (right opposite excel centre entrance)
Facilities - Big tick - Mini bar (not free) but can stock up cold drinks snacks from nearby Tesco Express - although this was the dirtiest Tesco I had ever been in!, coffee machine is a very nice touch the tablet with free WIFI is the best touch, wooden coat hangers, gowns & slippers, safe & even a pull out washing line over the shower!
now onto location, yes it is 20min on jubilee line from waterloo and being country bumkins we struggled when we got off to change to DLR (2 stops from canning town to Excel Centre) but after going up and down escalators like a comedy sketch we asked someone to put us on the right platform and off we went! - still got off on wrong side of the river somehow so more walking, anyway eventually found excel centre and The Sunborn! we then used every mode of London transport possible to get back to central London, cable car, thames clipper and back on tube but at least we saw most of the sights even if we felt like we has walked a marathon by the time we got back to hotel - maybe that's why we slept so well! but by 3rd day I managed to get in and out of central London without my partner which for someone who admits to 'not being able to find their way out of a paper bag' isn't bad!
So to sum it up I would give 10/10 and hope to return and I certainly think to get the same standard as you do in this hotel you would be looking at approx. £250 a night in other London hotels.",5,2015,02,16
119,I didn't want to leave.,"I Had an amazing time at the Sunborn hotel. The room was spacious, the staff was very helpful, we was welcomed with the best services from Mayriam, who made us feel special & aware of all the services available at the hotel. The room service was very ideal with the in-room-tablet which stays beside the bed. Breakfast had a decent full range, with a nice views of the docklands area.
We stayed at the room 2021 over looking towards the Excel & only stayed for 1 night for the Valentines day. It was an amazing experience & can't wait to do it again.

Mr Kwarteng & Ms Daley",5,2015,02,16
119,Refreshingly different,"Very pleasant alternative to a standard hotel. Easy to get to from City Airport and elsewhere by the DLR. No parking (except disabled) on site though I think there is parking available close by.
Very friendly and knowledgeable staff, we had a corporate event there, with particularly Elzbieta, Hugo and Oyinda making everything run smoothly. A few minor glitches which actually seemed to add to the character of the trip rather than being an annoyance!",5,2015,02,16
119,Great yacht but lacking in the service department.,"Stayed here as two couples for valentines weekend. On arrival the yacht takes your breath away. Easy to get to via taxi or train. The experience was as a whole ok as the sunborn is let down only by the service onboard. 

We wanted to have our two wifes to have some treatments in the spa so asked reception if we could arrange this. We were asked to wait in the bar and she would have the person come and see us straight away about this. Two hours later nobody arrived so we spoke with a manager and asked what the problem was and why weve been left without anyone coming to see us. His reply was poor and rude, he said with a tone ""the spa is obviously busy if nobody has came to see you"" my wife then stated ok we will go elsewhere then- it would have been nice to be told this two hours ago. He said thats fine! And walked away. Certainly not the level of service we are used to or expected from this hotel experience. 

Overall I would recommend this hotel based on the yacht however the service does let this place down im afraid. A real shame. We spent a second night in london at a hotel and the service was clear that this place is lacking behind.",3,2015,02,16
119,Wonderful Valentine treat,"Just had the most wonderful weekend on the Sunborn. From the moment we arrived we were made to feel special. We were early but our room was available so we were able to freshen up before going to an event at The Excel, which is a 2 min walk away. The room was extremely spacious and spotlessly clean. After a long day we had drinks in the bar and then ordered room service to finish off our day, which was delicious and quickly delivered. Had the best nights sleep ever in the comfy king size bed and an excellent breakfast the next morning. The staff could not have been more attentive, especially the wonderful Nazma on reception. This was our first stay on the yacht but definitely won't be our last.",5,2015,02,16
119,Wonderful stay for Valentines,"After the unique entry to the yacht by lift, you are met with the stunning reception staircase. We were early to check-in, but the staff were more than accommodating in holding our luggage for us until we could. A special mention must go to Nazma on reception, who was everything a receptionist should be, a credit to the hotel. The yacht itself is excellent, decorated in a way that you do not feel like you are in the confines of a boat, it's somehow spacious. The room we had was spotless, with a bed we wanted to take home, and a lovely room service breakfast ordered via the in-room tablet.
In closing, excellent staff, wonderful room, lovely food. A great stay, highly recommended.",5,2015,02,16
119,Amazing,We have just returned from a weekend on the sunborn. I can no honestly say this is the best hotel that we have ever stayed in. It was pure luxury. The rooms are beautiful and very spacious. The hotel staff can't do enough for you they are all so friendly and helpful. Nothing was to much trouble. The area around the yacht also has lots of bars and restaurants. Although the hotel was fully booked we did not hear any noise from the other rooms and didn't even hear the doors opening or closing of neighbours so not sure if the rooms are soundproofed. The area was easy to get to by car and there is a car park across the road that offers 24 hrs parking for £15. This was our first trip on the yacht but we are already looking at booking again.,5,2015,02,15
119,An amazing unique hotel,"We arrived at the hotel a little early. From the moment of stepping aboard the experience was excellent. The staff are helpful, friendly and bent over backwards to make our stay a memorable one. Breakfast is very good with the full range you would expect from this standard of hotel and at a reasonable rate. We stayed in a Executive room and it was incredible and a carpet your feet sunk into. The most amazing yacht. I only marked down the location as it is a little away from the centre on London but this can be taken either way. A bit more of a journey on if you are there for site seeing the normal sites, Westminster etc but also away from the hustle and bustle and a travel card soon solves this. A big thank you too all the staff for making our stay so memorable and I am happy to recommend this hotel. ",5,2015,02,14
119,Don't believe the hype,"I stayed here several months ago - it was very average. Stayed with a friend who booked it and hadn't realised how far out it was. Great if you are at the EXCEL. Wow factor when you walk in but rooms are typical cabin and not as luxurious as you would like. Thought it would be enjoyable for the kids to see - just me and them but couldn't get the web site today to work and it wouldn't take a booking for 1 adult and 2 kids. Went on website and then phoned. 4 attempts to get connected to the operator and reservations and then finally I got through to a man who could barely speak English who told me he was too busy to help and I had to call back later. Is this supposed to be good service. Shocking but perhaps he has done me a favour as there is naff all at the boat except the excel and once the wow factor of the entrance of the boat has gone - it goes quick, its not that great. Stay in a proper hotel in London unless you are at the excel.",3,2015,02,14
119,Luxury on a yacht,"Highly recommended! The yacht is beautiful; pure luxury on the inside and stylish and elegant on the outside. The views from the cocktail lounge and the deck are fantastic. The rooms are very spacious, comfortable and clean, much more spacious than you would expect on a boat. The staff are very friendly, helpful and knowledgeable about the yacht. The food is great too and the restaurant has a lovely calm and luxury atmosphere. I can highly recommend the ox cheeks; they were cooked to perfection. The duck as a starter was great too. Also a great selection of cocktails. Easy to get to on the DLR.

A great place to stay, dine out and take your friends!",5,2015,02,13
119,Really great,"Unfortunately we only had one night on the yacht and it was great.  The rooms are fantastic - plush carpets and really spacious.  Very nice bathroom, good shower.  As people have also commented, the view from the decks and the bar are great.  The only down-side I had was that the room was really quite warm - I had the aircon on 13 degrees, so it should have been cold, but I was still really hot.  But the bed and duvet meant a great nights sleep and at night, it's probably the darkest room I've ever been in!  Luxury from start to finish at a really decent price and a good location.",5,2015,02,13
119,fantastic voyage for landlubbers,"wonderful friendly staff, sorted my niggles, immediately. .Beautiful cabins marvellous food. Great for O2 cableway (closes at 8pm). .Dlr behind. Parked, used DLR and cableway. Very relaxing Even close to airport, Noise did not bother us.Amazing experience..",5,2015,02,13
119,Love the boat!,"Excellent quality room and service. Perfect for a stay-cation - can't wait to do it again! Such a comfortable bed we slept like babies. Well-designed ensuite bathroom. Great views from the decks. Felt like we'd been away even though it's technically still in town. We booked when there were no events at the conference centre next door so it was surprisingly peaceful too. Good transport links and secure flat-rate parking nearby. Yep, perfect.",5,2015,02,12
119,spectacular experience,"Great visit to this very special place in Londen.
We went to the Sunborn for some very nice cocktails with a spectacular view over Londons business district. After the drinks we had a great dinner at the Sunborn restaurant ''lands End''.
The service was very good and the food tasted great. Everything feels so luxury, but the prices were very reasonable. We had a fantastic evening at the Sunborn and i will recommend this place to anyone who visits London!",5,2015,02,12
119,A memorable weekend,"We had a very enjoyable stay at the Sunborn London.
We stayed in the Classic Kingsize room. The rooms are very well appointed, robe and slippers provided, and very comfy bed.

As the reason for my trip was to visit my daughter for her birthday I treated her and myself to treatments in the Sunborn spa. I had my nails done and my daughter had a facial. The treatments were lovely and the colleague who delivered them was a lovely young woman who did a great job.

We had a great weekend, and I would definitely stay at the Sunborn again.",4,2015,02,11
119,An amazing stay in a super hotel,"I booked the hotel for three friends & I to stay in when we went to Strictly live. It couldn't be faulted, everything was just perfect and all of the staff were friendly & helpful. Special thanks to Maryiam & Claudio who gave us a lovely welcome & set the tone for our stay. The rooms were great, looking over the river, lunch delicious,  and champagne cocktails in the bar began our evening nicely. Because the hotel is so near to the cable car we had the added bonus of being able to use this to get to the O2 & enjoy the view of London by night.
The Sunborn is most certainly one of the best hotels I have stayed in and the staff second to none. I cannot recommend it highly enough, and we will all be staying there again. Thank you Andreas, to you & your staff for making our trip so memorable. Jean",5,2015,02,10
119,"Excellent Hotel, bad experience","Booked for my birthday. What a fantastic combination, hotel on a yacht in London. Anyhow this hotel is very nice and the staff are very polite and friendly. So, we checked inn to our Exec river view room which was spottless. Once settled we decided to start our evening in the hotel bar, sadly, we sat down ordered a couple of drinks and as we just started to enjoy the view, along comes this extremely drunk guy who asked for a light. I happened to have a lighter and handed it to him and once he lit his fag he threw the lighter back at me through the doors that lead to the deck. After finishing his cigarette he came back and sat directly opposite us, speaking loudly, swearing and making a idiot out of himself. This continued for about 15-20 minutes. To cut a long story short this guy should have been removed from this luxury hotel but instead the staff were serving him even more drinks which were just adding more fuel to his fire. After a first round of drinks we got fed up and left the yacht bar and went over to Fox bar which is located a few minutes walk from the yacht. One of the main reasons for visiting and drinking in the hotel bar is the view of Docklands which is fantastic. We wanted to take a good few photos of ourselves in the bar and deck with a Docklands view but because of this drunk guy giving us grief we did not get even 1 photo. Next day at checking out I told the staff there what had happened and they were very courteous and spoke to the manager who told them to cancel the charge for the drinks of our bill (£18). After paying nearly £200 we did not get to enjoy this hotel the way we expected and really felt dissapointed that the manager did not do anything vast to rectify our bad experience. I would have appericiated something more than the mere £18 he took of our bill but equally did not want stand at the reception desk arguing and sounding like a couple of freeloaders. The receptionist told us that next time we visit that she will sort something out for us but to be honest I don't really know that I will have the oppurtunity to visit again.",3,2015,02,10
119,Great Staff / Great food /Great stay,"Really enjoyed my night on the Sunborn London. Staff were very attentive, noting being to much trouble. The food was superb and the views whether I was in my suite, the resturant or the bar were spetacular!",5,2015,02,10
119,Fabulous hotel,"i provisionally booked 3 separate nights at this hotel before our first visit due to the superb price they were offering for a nights stay. On arrival we were greeted by friendly staff (Maryiam and Mitel, apologies if i have spelt incorrectly) they couldn't do enough for us. We didn't eat in the boat and went to a local Thai restaurant which was recommended by the staff if we wasn't eating there. the room was spacious and very clean. at checkout we were asked if everything was ok with the stay in which we replied with fantastic. We informed them we have booked two more stays with them for birthdays and was told we will be surprised on our next arrival and they will work their magic to make our birthday stay extra special. I can't wait for my next trip to the sunborn. Thanks again to maryiam and Mitel and all the other staff for a very pleasant lovely weekend.",5,2015,02,09
119,The Sunborn - Excellent experience!,"We arrived at this beautiful hotel/super yacht a little early so had to wait a short while for one of the rooms to be ready which wasn't a problem as we sat in the bar/lounge for a coffee for starters, followed by a couple of glasses of wine and a light lunch!

On arrival we were greeted by Claudio who whisked away our suitcases and gave us a lovely welcome.  We were checked in by Maryiam who was also very friendly and welcoming.

We were shown to our rooms which were spotlessly clean and very roomy, we were really lucky to be allocated rooms that overlooked the river.  The carpets were very soft and deep.  The décor was lovely shiny wood with a coffee machine and a mini bar.  The bathroom was spotlessly clean with large fluffy white towels.  The shower was fantastic!

There are a few restaurants nearby and the cable car to get across to the O2 is only a short walk away and costs only £4.00 one way. 

Breakfast was plentiful with a choice of juices, fresh fruit, croissants, cereals, full cooked and toast. Service was excellent.

The Sunborn is a gem of a hotel and we had a fabulous experience from start to finish, we will definitely be going back again, just wished we could have stayed longer!

Thank you Sunborn for making our stay so memorable.",5,2015,02,09
119,A brilliant stay,"My boyfriend booked this hotel as part of my Christmas present to go and watch Strictly live. From the time we arrived at the hotel to the time we checked out, the service was impeccable in every area. 

Our room was fantastic, with a great view of the Docklands and over to Canary Wharf. We ate in the hotel's restaurant and the food was delicious; unfortunately due to having to get over to the o2 for 7.30 we only had a main and dessert but all of the restaurant's staff were really polite and helpful.

All in all, a brilliant experience at a unique and beautiful hotel. Would 100% recommend.",5,2015,02,09
119,Wonderful Weekend,"We have just returned from an amazing weekend celebrating my mother's upcoming wedding. The team at the Sunborn went above and beyond to make our stay an experience to remember. From the second we walked out of the glass elevator and into the exquisite lobby, we were waited on hand and foot. 
Check in was efficient and we were then escorted to our room with our luggage following. The rooms are beautiful, spacious and just a pleasure to stay in. We had everything we needed, including a great coffee machine and comfy giant bed. 
Lunch in the bar was very tasty and the share platters were great for us all and good value for money. In the evening we had the dinner offer which included a glass of champagne. This was also amazing food, the Moroccan lamb couldn't be faulted. Breakfast had lots of different choices to suit everyone, something we greatly enjoyed whilst looking out across the Thames. 
Another great thing about the Yaht is how close it is to the Emirates cable cars over the river. Just a few minutes walk and you can jump in a cable car to take you over to Greenwich and straight to the river bus dock back to the centre. 
I would like to thank the Sunborn team for giving us all, especially my mother, a truly fantastic weekend. I'm sure we will see you again soon!",5,2015,02,09
119,Amazing weekend,"After looking at many hotels to stay in London we came across the Sunborn! WOW!  So different with lovely views of the 02 and the  cable cars in walking distance which take you direct to the 02.  The rooms, service, breakfast and staff was all wonderful and the cocktails were lovely!  Great for a short break and on the door step of the Excel too.  Highly recommend to stay here and we will definitely be returning.",5,2015,02,08
119,Stunning!!,"From the moment we walked in to the moment we left everything was perfect!ALL the staff were so kind and nothing was to much!
I would recommend this hotel to everyone!
Plus we has one of the best nights sleep we have ever had,the bed was amazing!!thankyou Sunborn!!Chris and Jade ",5,2015,02,08
119,Mixed feelings on New year's Eve,"My boyfriend & I stayed here for two nights over NY. 
Firstly its taken me a while to write this as I have mixed feelings about this Hotel/yacht.
Yes when you Eventually find it it is impressive from the outside & at night it looks nice with the coloured lights making it look more like a nightclub than hotel.
There are No signs anywhere & even when you enter the lift the reception isnt clearly marked.
The Entrance/reception is nice & shiney & staff welcome you on board, the 70's club style hotel. Very glitzy & even though its not my taste & rather dated I did grasp the concept of a Luxurious stay, as you would get on cruise.
Check in was a not very clear however it was rather self explanitary. We booked on a Room only basis as the thought of paying over £20 for a breakfast (which i had already read on here that the breakfasts werent the best! & there's a cheap cafe around the corner of the street) so i cant comment on breakfast.
Our room had a balcony & was very spaces, once again the70's decor was everywhere with mirrors & glass everywhere. Yes rooms were ok but its a dust collector! Our table over the 2days was really bad by the time we left! 
Beds were nice & big & i liked the balcony.
We spent our NY on site. Which was all very Low key, mainly couples like ourselves. As i do not eat Venision I did email the restaurant to ask for an alternative. After contacting them Numerous times via Email & phoning. I finally had confirmation they could accomodate my needs only a few hrs before dinner. My option was Chicken which was ok but hardly something special as a gala dinner... i did request steak as I would of thought that was easy & price reflected something of quality rather than a not so exciting chicken. I own a catering company so yes im fussy & i suppose to many people their Gala meal was lovely. Personally I found it quite bland & even though you had various purees & sauces I found them all to be rather bland. However the presentation was very pretty & I can appreciate the whole fine dinning but I was left very hungry. Service wasnt the best & no one served us so i kept asking!! To be honest seeing as most of the staff are not First language British spoken, I found it easier to speak to them in Italian rather than English. Unfortunately our head waitress was losing her voice so i gave up with any type of communication!
The set up with a 2nd bar on top dec was terrible & badly organised. In the end we resorted to our room with a few bottles as the Atmosphere was so boring & bar drinks are typically over priced for London.
I know i sound like i had a bad time But It is what it is & my Boyfriend was over the moon with this suprise trip.  
Yes it is very expensive so stock up at the little supermarket round the corner.
Yes its out of london past Canary Wharf & i dont know this area as im more central london. Glad I stayed & tried it. Transport looked easy however we had Taxis' in & out of the centre.
No I wont be rushing back as it didnt float my boat (sorry just had to write that!!) I can understand &apreciate the concept. Guests seemed pleased & happy so your doing something right! Just Not for me. 
It didnt help as there was a cock up with my Bill. I was very Shocked to know they got my bill mixed with someone elses & had Already Taken money off my card without my permission!!! I honestly had had guts full of trying to work out peoples accents & communicate that I just paid & left quickly.
As i mentioned my Boyfriend thought it was Fab but you cant please everyone & it wasnt for me.",3,2015,02,07
119,London's best kept secret.,"Great hotel and restaurant right next to Excel, based in a luxury super yacht for not much more than the cost of the Ibis next door. The rooms are clean and modern, ours looked out across the water with huge windows and a balcony. Fabulous food in the restaurant overlooking the O2 arena. Fantastic value. ",5,2015,02,07
119,Visit to London,"This yacht hotel is situated near the Excel and there is access to the O2 via cable cars. The Hotel is impeccably decorated and very clean. The rooms are lovely. They are very tastefully furnished in elegant wood furniture and cool crisp colours and deep luxurious carpets. The complimentary toiletries are of good standard and a Lavazza coffee maker is supplied with pods complimentary as well as hot chocolate and earl grey tea. There is an in-room tablet provided for guests use. The let downs are the bed is very uncomfortable as are the pillows. A smart TV is provided but access to the Internet is not permitted through it. The radio in the corridors is constantly playing which is lovely during the day but not so good when your trying to sleep.  We paid for a double and got two single beds pushed together, which when your paying the price we paid we expected better. A good experience but not sure I would want to repeat unless the beds are upgraded to a better quality and I was guaranteed to get what I paid for, ie a double. ",4,2015,02,07
119,excellent stay,"It was truly great. The staff are really friendly and helpful especially Maryiam and Oyinda at the reception desk. The rooms are spacious and everywhere you go, there is a wonderful relaxed atmosphere.",5,2015,02,07
119,Fabulous,"Well I had booked this hotel through an online third party and originally planned to stay last October to attend a concert at the O2. The concert was postpomed but I managed to change the booking to coincide with the new date of the concert, 5/02/15. The location was fabulous, and the loom on my wife's face when we arrived outside this yacht was priceless. Check in was a breeze and the receptionist gave us a quick run down on room service and the bar we quickly found our room which was a classic riverfacing room on the 2nd floor. It was palatial and possibly one of the biggest hotel rooms I have stayed in at that price range! Unfortunately we were only staying for one night and did not have the opportunity to sample all the Sunborn has to offer however from what we experienced we would highly recommend it for any traveller looking for that little bit extra. A fabulous hotel in a tranquil location ideal for visiting the exel centre and the O2. We look forward to our next visit.",5,2015,02,06
119,Something different,"My partner and I stayed for 1 night in January, the boat is docked and I'm sure has no engine so cannot sail.
The surrounding area is not great so there is not much to do locally unless you get a cable cart to the 02, but we was quite happy to chill for the day.
Lunch in the bar was nice but even though I walked to the bar and paid straight away the 12.5% tip was automatically added.
I popped off to the treatment room for a couple of hours for a massage and facial which were both lovely, you can use the nearby hotels facilities that has a pool and steam etc but unfortunately I didn't bring my costume.
Dinner in the restaurant we found to be average, which was mainly due to the mains lacking in flavour, but we did address this to the management and it was adjusted from our bill.
The bar in the evening was busy and had a nice atmosphere.
If your looking for somewhere local and something different then this is the place to go,all in all our stay wasn't cheap and for the money we could have probably gone to a country manor spa but we don't regret going.",4,2015,02,05
119,Great Night Away,"Our nights stay was a wedding present, we were not disappointed it was stunning, room was massive and bathroom surprisingly big for on a boat and lovely heated floor great for a stay in December, the view was amazing from the deck especially at night, a slight disappointment that our view was the side of the dock and some of staff at breakfast didn't seem to understand English as asked for a plate and they just nodded walked in the kitchen and didn't come back lol",4,2015,02,04
119,Excellent,"Stayed just a night. Starting from Check-in to Check-out everything was perfect. The room excellent. Good coffee in the room. Excellent Breakfast spread and overall a great hotel.

The only thing I noticed was the lights in the room do not switch off even when the key is taken out!

Will be back.",4,2015,02,03
119,The best night stay!,My partner and I stayed at the Sunborn Hotel on Thursday the 29th January. All the staff were reasonably friendly but our favourite was Nazma lovely smiley welcoming lady. She made our stay very special. As it was mine and my partners anniversary it was so lovely to find out we had been given an upgrade and 50% off our first drink at the hotel bar. The cocktails were unusual some really nice but some a little odd. The bedroom was beautiful I highly advise to request room 2014. We will be back very soon and will be brining friends too! Thank you for our stay and thanks Nazma for making it extra special! ,5,2015,02,02
119,Bit of a disappointment. ,"We arrived at 1pm to be told check in wasn't until 3pm but they would speak to house keeping to see if they could arrange our room to be sorted sooner we was also told we had been upgraded to the junior suite great! Now it all went down hill...
Room wasn't ready until 3:45 and we had to keep chasing to find out as we was traveling with a child and really just wanted to unpack and settle) We was given the key to the room got in the lift pushed level 5 and the lift just wouldn't go past level 4 so back down to reception where a man who who had suffered a personality by pass helped us and was rather blunt saying level 4 is 5 (well who of thought that!!) we was then shown to our room...
Our luggage wasn't in there 
A bed wasn't set up for our child
It's view was excel 
And the room was filthy covered in finger prints with broken cupboard doors!! 
I told Mr no personality that I thought we had booked a river view and although it's great we have been upgraded its not what I wanted his response this is a 4 star hotel what do you expect? Errmmm better than this! 
I then had a chat with Apo the guest service manager who said if we could wait 15 more minutes he would arrange for us to move in to the junior suite river view room or the executive family room with river view (what we had booked). Apo finally managed to sort the junior suite with the river view walked in and the bed was set up for our little girl but still no luggage (took another ten minutes for that to arrive!!) 
Rooms are horribly decorated all fake wood gold and garish. Our room also suffered plumbing problems as the sink wouldn't drain away and the pillows are awful I've had better nights sleep in budget hotels. Furniture is tatty and only three English plug sockets in the room.
I was also shocked at no complimentary water or English tea! 
All in all the stay was very disappointing staff are friendly but seem unorganised and even tried to blame the check in delay on a technical fault (assuming housekeeping are computer operated??) 
We was also told by Apo we wouldn't pay the full rate on check out as we have had so many problems but low and behold at check out nothing had changed and we ended up just paying and leaving.
After our stay lots of friends and family have asked if I recommend the sunborn the answer is no sadly. ",2,2015,02,02
119,A unique experience,"As you exit the lift into reception you'd be forgiven for thinking you had arrived at a high-class hotel in Dheli or Mumbai. You are greeted by a line of beuatifully turned-out, attractive and smiling girls of obvious Indian extract. Professional and courteous you will be quickly checked in and you and your cases are conveyed to your 'cabin';  in our case overlooking the Royal Victoria dock. Warm, comfortable and well stocked with a min-bar an coffee machine.The yacht is glitzy - highly polished brass and high-gloss in-laid wood - again reminiscent of a Dheli hotel. The restaurant is well appointed with fabulous views. Not too large but you are not too close to your neighbouring tables either. Dinner was superb, absolutely fault-less fine dining - ""a cacophany"" of flavours on hot, hot plates (so important!). Curiously though, bread rolls are not offered at dinner  although there was a side plate! Breakfast was a buffet affair so the 'All-English' breakfast is likely to have become a little dry unless you manage to get there as they replenish. Stick to the pastries, fruit, cold meats and cheese is my advice. Overall a very pleasant stay. Johansens standard it is not but the uniquness and location is a must.",4,2015,02,02
119,Sunborn Yacht London Amazing!!,Stayed the night for my wife's birthday on 30th January in anexecutive room with balcony. Very plush surroundings and greeted by Apostolos front of house manager who could not do enough for us. The room was beautiful which also included free wifi and tablet. Breakfast is served in a fantastic restaurant with views over River Thames and across to Canary Wharf. Look out for the gorgeous staircase in reception. This place is sure to impress and has the added bonus of polite friendly staff.,5,2015,02,01
119,Mr White,Rooms amazing food amazing real luxury loved it. Only stayed one night wish we could have stayed longer. Maryanne on reception was fantastic really helpful and Romao was lovely to they couldnt do enough to help you. ,5,2015,02,01
119,"Great rooms, great hotel","the hotel had very nice rooms -- spacious and comfortable, cute balcony too. Dinner at the restaurant was also very nice (delicious oxtail!) but the breakfast was average. Very interesting  concept for a hotel, but found the decor a bit dated.",3,2015,01,31
119,We'll worth the money,"Had a lovely nite n nice stay
Clean rooms
Big rooms
Friendly staff
Very clean 
Nice river views
Big bathrooms
Good location
Spotless on the boat 
AMAZING
Breakfast eat all u want all luvly n fresh 
Very posh hotel ",5,2015,01,31
119,The perfect hotel....almost,"I booked this for a surprise birthday trip for my husband. He loves yachts but I don't like sailing so it seemed the perfect compromise!

And in almost every category this was an absolutely perfect choice.

It's grand, fun, luxurious and different. Many of today's hotels are ""same old same old"" but this one has something new to offer. The rooms were incredible, with really deep and soft carpets, lovely tea and coffee making facilities, and divine bed and compact and clean bathroom. The public areas were very nice too and the bar had a lovely atmosphere. Must recommend the Windjammer cocktail, heavenly!!

For what we saw of the staff, all were very attentive and friendly, and I considered it to be excellent value.

The only drawback was its location. The DLR to Canning Town, and a change to the jubilee line (a very busy commuter route) for another 20 minutes just to get to waterloo, became a little tiresome. 

And the area the yacht is moored is also strange. Right next to the excel centre, it was like a ghost town (I'm sure it's busier when theres a conference on, and then it could be considered too busy!) and, as a result, a bit eerie.

Our lasting impression as we checked out was, if we could pick this up and put it 10 minutes down the river, it would be perfect!

I think, despite its location, because of everything else going for it, we would stay again!",5,2015,01,28
119,Somewhere a bit different to stay,My husband and I stayed for 2 nights to celebrate my 60th birthday on 26th January 2015. The yacht catches the eye from the dock side and internally the decor is impressive. Our room was spacious and to a high standard. The breakfasts were good value and the dinner we ate on my birthday was excellent. We could not fault our stay at the Sunborn and must say all of the staff were professional and pleasant.,5,2015,01,27
119,Birthday treat!,"We had a fantastic stay just after the new year. The service was excellent and we were really well looked after by all the staff and Andreas Stys (The general manager).
The rooms are very comfortable with huge beds and spacious bathrooms.

All-in-all, it was a special experience which we look forward to having again sometime in the future.",5,2015,01,27
119,Refreshingly different !,"If you're looking for something different - this is it. Really fantastic hotel - friendly staff, in particular Nazma, it is so nice to meet her on reception, nothing is a problem.  Good food and a really great idea.  Rooms were immaculate, really spacious with lovely views.  Couldn't fault anything about the stay.  Would definitely go back.",5,2015,01,27
119,Nice for a change!,"Lovely experience - nice for a special occasion.  The cabins are well appointed, very spacious and spotlessly clean. Our cabin was on the waterside so we benefited from the view from the large porthole window.  The shower was very good.  Welcome and checkout were efficient and pleasant.  The bar was comfortable an conducive to good conversation - table service from the bar was a nice touch.  Being able to go out on deck was very nice.  
Breakfast was fine but very overpriced for what it was - and the people I considerately using their mobile phones in the dining room rather spoiled the atmosphere and enjoyment of the time.",4,2015,01,26
119,Something Different and Very Nice,"Just stayed for one night while attending the Excel. The location near City Airport makes it ideal if you are flying in and very near to DLR station if you need to go into the city. Check-in was very good and was given an upgrade to a river facing suite. This was very comfortable and well equipped with a large balcony. Did not eat on-board but had a couple of drinks in the bar and service was good and sitting looking out over the river at night was spectacular. Check out was again very efficient with staff keen to get feedback on the stay.
Could not fault anything with the stay and being on a ship in the centre of London was just a bit special.",5,2015,01,26
119,PERFECT!,"Myself and fiancé stayed at the Sunborn in January 2015. Our whole stay was absolutely outstanding with staff, cleanliness, service and location all perfect for celebrating our 1 year engagement. We will never forget our stay and we will most definitely be back soon! Thank you to all who made our stay perfect!",5,2015,01,25
119,New Year Stay At Sunborn,"Booked 2 rooms for this stay on 29th dec until New Year's Day. First impressions very good beautiful staircase and chandelier. Rooms lovely comfy bed robe slippers tablet coffee machine mini bar balcony to look onto Thames. Food good. Really enjoyed our stay was something day for new year watched fireworks from our balcony.
Only problem we did have when we checked in an error was made on my card they took payment of £880.00 by mistake ! which I was told would be refunded back that day however it took 12 days for the refund back on my card no one would take responsibility for the error never returned any phone calls emails or a letter of complaint eventually got refund back myself by phoning my bank and them sorting the problem out. Overall lovely stay but very poor customer service not what I would expect for £1800 for a 3 night stay",5,2015,01,25
119,Lived up to Expectations,"I stayed here for the convenience of its closeness to the Excel and DLR.
The executive room I stayed in was well appointed with fantastic views from the balcony of the O2, Canary Wharf and the Shard. The fast wifi was simple to access with an easy interface.
The Lavazza coffee machine in the room was a nice touch. The bathroom had a fab shower with good water pressure and Molton Brown smellies!
Nazma's greeting on arrival was fantastic. Such a friendly, happy, helpful member of staff. She dealt with my check in very efficiently.
The only downside was the planes coming and going from the city airport.",5,2015,01,25
119,open the curtains to the river and views of the excel,"Oh the rooms the rooms they are fab the bathroom with gold taps and thick white towel oh the mini bar and coffee machine the beds were Devine breakfast was a wee bit disappointing as it was very basic and tasteless but views of the O2 chair lifts was good to look at 
The surroundings inside the ship we're beautiful with a great staircase to the top deck 
Hey it's  different",4,2015,01,24
119,Afternoon tea at Sunborn,"I was looking for somewhere different for afternoon tea and came across Sunborn Yacht Hotel, I originally though it was in the Canary Wharf but it's further out near the excel centre. Our first impressions coming up to the yacht were good. You take a lift up to the reception area .  From here there is the bar area where we had afternoon tea and up the centre stairs there is a restaurant which looked lovely and would be the ideal place for afternoon tea as it was bright and seemed more luxurious.  The staff are very friendly and polite our table was reserved and we had two big couches.  The bar itself is quite bland and understated with loads of large couches. There was a good selection of teas which we picked from.  The afternoon tea was nicely presented the sandwiches were fresh as were the scones.  The reason I marked lower than very good is that I didn't think the cakes were up to a good standard given the price.  The cupcake was ok but served with hundreds and thousands, the brownie and carrot cake slice tasted dry.  As afternoon tea is such a popular and there is so much choice of venues in London I would expect more.  It lacked any wow factor.  Overall it was a pleasant experience but not enough to warrant a return unfortunately.",3,2015,01,24
119,Fantastic - Must Try!,"From the minute we checked in we were made to feel the most welcome we've ever been made to feel at a hotel. £40 for each day charged to your card upon arrival just incase you use mini bar or room service, given back at end of stay if unused. Upon checking in we were told we had been given a free upgrade to a room with a balcony which was fantastic. We had a dockside view but it was so peaceful and quiet. The room itself was a great size for 2 people and had everything you could possibly need including free wifi which worked perfectly for me, the shower room was an alright size which also had everything you needed. Unfortunately we didn't eat or drink onboard as we found it a little pricey, although I don't know what else we expected from a 4* hotel, hotel bar open until 1am midweek. We found a great indian buffet a 2 minute walk from the hotel entrance which was really good and pretty good value for money too. Room was cleaned when we hung the sign on the door and when I say cleaned I mean cleaned, when we returned to our room after a day trip into London it was sparkling. We had a 2 night stay as we were attending an event at the O2 and believe it or not, this was the cheapest hotel I could find in this specific area. Checking out was so easy and the staff were again lovely, we got a card so if we stay again we hand it over when checking in and get something free ie room upgrade or meal so if that or the hotel itself is not an incentive to return then the fact that all staff are first class definitely is. Will definitely return in the future.",5,2015,01,24
119,Weekend stay,"The yacht looks very impressive. We stayed for two nights as we were going to the boat show which is held at excel, which is a two minute walk away. The rooms are lovely, we had an executive suite with balcony and it was very comfortable and had a tablet and wifi, robes, slippers, coffee machine, mini bar. The staff were very freindly and helpful, especially Nazma(meaning star) on the front desk. We had been before and she remembered us. The breakfast was excellent, everything you could ask for. The reception is very impressive with a gold staircase and chandelier. We highly recommend this hotel.",5,2015,01,23
119,EXCELLENT,"We stayed here for two nights whilst attending the O2. I have to say it was absolutely amazing. The room was a great size with a balcony overlooking the Thames and the staff were very professional and courteous, you would know they were professionals and not just there for a job, but had a real interest in the Hospitality Industry. The view from the yacht at night was amazing and you could see the O2 lit up in all its glory. Would definitely recommend here if you are visiting O2 and will be staying again and with the City Airport only five minutes away, it is perfect. Five stars",5,2015,01,23
119,Luxury Hotel on Water,"We had an amazing stay at the Sunborn London.  Booked as a surprise gift for my Husband, alongside concert tickets at the O2, we had the most fantastic time. 
Located outside the Excel building, the yacht itself looks very impressive and is very secure.  You enter the yacht via a lift, but can only access the reception - the other floors are only accessible using a room key card.
We were given an upgrade to a Riverview Executive Suite which had a private balcony looking out over the water to the O2.  The room was spacious and luxurious and contained a tablet to access the free wifi along with the usual features you would expect to have in a 4 star hotel.
Our booking included breakfast, which is self service.  There was plenty to choose from including, a hot selection, cereals, fruits etc.  The hot food is replenished very frequently, so you are guaranteed a freshly cooked breakfast.  We later stayed for an evening meal after having a drink in the lounge bar.  We were even escorted from the lounge to the dining room by one of the bar staff and introduced to the member of staff in charge that evening.  We were made to feel special, as I would imagine you would be if you privately hired a luxury yacht like this.  We ordered just a main course each, as we had to get back home that evening and had a long train journey ahead.  The food was freshly cooked, well presented and delicious with lots of flavour. 
All the staff in the hotel were very friendly and attentive.
Overall, it was a very enjoyable stay and we would definitely book again.",5,2015,01,21
119,overnight stay,One night stay as visiting to see a show really great experience. Staff extremely polite and efficient .Executive suite superb use of tablet and good WiFi a bonus. Recommend if you want something different and a little bit special.,5,2015,01,21
119,Fabulous,"Had a fantastic weekend, the restaurant food and service was superb. Breakfast the same. We had a classic room and it was enormous, we had a great time. Highly recommended if you are going to the Excel.",5,2015,01,20
119,Different,"What a great and different hotel, loved the whole experience.
Room 1030 was just perfect.
Staff really helpful.
Breakfast choice superb.
Location for the 02 and Excel was really handy.
WIFI in the room 1st class.",5,2015,01,20
119,Hidden Gem,"It is very flashy and nice looking inside and out, Staff were very professional and helpful. It beats your bog standard hotel anyday. Very close to the O2 and Emirates Sky Line in a very nice area of East London. Would definately stay here again it made the trip that little bit different! Overall a fantastic stay!",5,2015,01,20
119,A warm welcome,"Having stayed in numerous hotels in London you expect the same impersonal service that you receive in them all. What a difference here!! The staff could not do enough for you, they were so friendly and welcoming. The rooms were very spacious and clean, much larger than you would expect on a yacht hotel. The receptionist, Nazma, was particularly helpful and so friendly. I would recommend this hotel to anyone visiting London for the O2 arena or the exhibition centre. I will definitely be returning .",5,2015,01,19
119,"Beautiful hotel, awful breakfast service!","I was surprised by my partner to be staying at this incredible hotel! We came down from Wales to visit the Boat show which was not a far walk at all! 
The room interior was gorgeous, the shower was lovely and hot, and the bed was the best bed we have ever slept in! So comfy. We stayed in one of the executive rooms, which overlooked the water. Everything we needed in the room. The bar is lovely to have a drink in at night as you over look the water with all the lights shining over it. 
The only downside to the stay was the breakfast. Seeing as you pay so much for the breakfast, it would of been nicer if it was made to order. Myself and a few other customers waited at the buffet for the empty trays to be filled back up. So all the food on my plate already was going cold, and all of the staff seemed to have no clue what was going on and running around like headless chickens! When I did get a chance to eat it, it was lovely though. 
All in all, a lovely hotel, and I hope next time when I return that the breakfast team will be more consistent and a bit more on the ball!",4,2015,01,19
119,Beautiful Unique Hotel with a few slip ups,"As well as visiting the boat show it was my husbands birthday so decided to stay here for something a bit special.  Fortunately we were already parked in Excel so left car there overnight as hotel has no on site car park but no problem.  On arrival, we were welcomed by very friendly staff, especially Claudia, thank you... I confirmed we had made reservation by email for dinner at 7pm but they had no record of this but promptly arranged this for us.  

I booked a romantic package executive with river view.  On arrival at room, it was very spacious and beautifully fitted out with tea, coffee, tablet & gorgeous molton brown toiletries.  Unfortunately the room had not been set up for romantic package and Claudia advised that this had been an oversight and would set up once we left room for dinner.  We had pre-dinner drinks in the bar which was very welcoming and staff very attentive serving great cocktails.  We were lucky to have a table for dinner at the window so enjoyed stunning night views.  We did feel menu was slightly restrictive for choice however, the food we ate was exceptional.  Once again, we were asked to agree charges for dinner, however, this was included in package with the exception of drinks.  However, by this time, I was passed keep correcting our booking and just decided to sort it upon check out.  Our bed was very comfortable and not at all disturbed by adjoining rooms or movement in the lobby.  

I had prebooked breakfast but unfortunately we were again quoted rate whilst eating but waiter promptly apologised after speaking to reception.  
As suspected when we check out, we had been charged for package, dinner in full and champagne they had put in the room.  After a 15 minute discussion of going through what was what, this was recitifed, however, they stated their systems were down and could not print out bill and this would be emailed.  This was, and it was wrong, showing that I had a balance to pay !!!

Overall, this is a beautiful yacht, the service is excellent and a very unique place to stay in London.   We really enjoyed our night on board but I think it could have been exceptional if things had been right from the start.  However, I would definately recommend and hope to stay again and considering a visit to stay on board ship in Gibraltar too.",4,2015,01,19
119,Fantastic staff & service second to none. I shall be recommending to anyone I know who is going to London for a break.,"Fantastic hotel. DLR 2 minutes walk. Highly recommended 10 out of 10. 😀 can't wait to go back. Adjacent to Excel for the boat show which we went over to. Across the dock from the O2. From check in to leaving every thing for great. Staff service was great an attention to detail again second to none. 
",5,2015,01,19
119,Great all-round experience. Something a little different.,"Really good position near the Excel Exhibition Centre in Royal Docks, London. We had a lower 'classic room' (1041) near the bow of the ship. Not a great view but the room itself was large and well fitted out.It was a very 'different' experience being afloat on a yacht. 
The staff were brilliant and extremely attentive. Nothing was too much trouble for them. Great cocktail bar with magnificent views across to Canary Wharf and the 02. Try the cocktails! 

Free wifi and in-room tablet were also an added bonus.

All in all it was a great weekend experience with a difference.",5,2015,01,18
119,Poor customer service!,Beautiful interior. Amazing to go there. Would Recommend to anyone had it not been for the atrocious service we received.  Ela from reception had no interpersonal skills and had a very bad attitude problem. Acting like she owns the hotel. When asked to speak to a manager she made up an excuse and didn't let us speak to one. As long as she is still working there i definitely will not return. What should have been a great night became a horrible night thanks to ela.,2,2015,01,18
119,Nearly perfect,"Just got home after staying the w/end here. The staff are so helpful and really polite they try to do as much as possible for you. 
Cleanliness of the room was top notch plenty of fluffy white towels, iron/board and MB toiletries. Shower was lush.. Spa with Elemis products on level 3 but didn't visit. Parking was a pain we parked in royal Victoria car park it's £15. A night. Food in the bar is ok. Found a small nearby cafe for breakfast which was really quite good. If you want a river ring or email ahead to request it. My biggest qualm was it's very slippy in the wet please be careful. Take a few snacks and drinks it's really expensive. Tesco express and a nisa shop nearby
Had a lovely relaxing rest thanku 💌",4,2015,01,18
119,Excellent hotel,Wow what a lovely hotel. Had an excellent evening. Service definitely  what is expected. Staff friendly and eager to make stay welcoming. Rooms perfect. Food really good.  Views from sea view room was great.  Could see O2 where we enjoyed Queen concert and boat show 2 minutes walk next day. Recommend experience.  ,5,2015,01,18
119,Excellent customer service,"Many thanks to all the staff that made our stay enjoyable, the service was first class. We stayed on board as we were attending the Boat Show at the Excel centre which is close by and we were not disappointed. The Concierge came to our car and collected our luggage and took them to our room while we checked in. We were greeted warmly and to our surprise we  also got an upgrade. The Executive room was very spacious and had everything we needed, it was more like a suite than a room, including a tablet and free internet connection. From the balcony we had a lovely view over the water. The room was also equipped with a very good coffee machine and tea making facilities, and the complementary Molten Brown toiletries were a lovely touch.  I would not hesitate to return to this Hotel and look forward to doing so.",5,2015,01,17
119,Just a little attention to minor annoyances would make this just perfect,"Reception staff so pleasant and welcoming but wished they had remembered to inform us of important information in regard to using the facilities in our room.

1. We had no coffee in our hospitality tray, that was because there was no coffee machine in our room.  Someone had noticed that otherwise coffee would have been left.  However, again such helpful reception staff ensured we had coffee delivered to our room.

2. Couldn't get the hairdryer to work. 

3. Could not telephone reception as that wasn't working. (No info regarding ignoring the list on the telephone but dial 0 for reception).  As just out of the shower and with, dripping hair, I had to go to reception and ask for hairdryer.
Again, very helpful staff member came to my room to show me......

Stand to the left of the mirror and you will see the reflection of the power switch which is located, hidden on the back of the hairdryer,which is  next to the mirror.  Switch it down and voila.......power.

The hotel just beautiful, the room and bed so comfortable. The bathroom with proper toiletries, Molten Brown actually, (not a plastic bottle stuck on the shower wall). The view of Canary Wharf and other London views from this 'Yacht Hotel' on water, stunning at night.

The staff just want you to enjoy your  stay and will work to this end.  They should just take note of above and they will accomplish.",4,2015,01,16
119,Nautical novelty in East end docks.,"An unusual idea, having a decommissioned luxury yacht berthed in the east end docks. We used the hotel because we were visiting the Boat Show which was located at the nearby Excel exhibition centre. We enjoyed the novelty for two days. Room had decent sized dimensions and good amenities including a free tablet. No view to speak of near to the water line!

Restaurant has spectacular views of Canary Wharf in the evening. Fish dishes enjoyable and service good. A tad expensive.",4,2015,01,15
119,"A unique, beautiful bargain!","I stayed here on NYE with my partner as we were attending a wedding nearby. The pictures on Expedia looked great, almost too good to be true, especially for the price (£150 a night, the IBIS on the same street was over £220!). We were not disappointed! The yacht looked fantastic from the outside, a nice imposing structure which makes a great first impression - would be perfect for a surprise trip! 

The reception staff were all very professional and friendly and we managed to check in early. This was something that the hotel could guarantee in advance however. The hotel was offering a complimentary late check out of 2pm on NYD which was absolutely fantastic after a few too many proseccos! An extra additional nice touch was returning to the room in the evening to find a hand written thank you note and a selection of macarons! 

We were situation on the ground floor of the hotel, which unfortunately didn't have much of a view (mainly of the scummy water with rubbish floating around it in front of the window). The hotel does of course offer higher rooms ,some with balconies which I can imagine would be fantastic. 

The room itself was huge, more of a suite than a room! The room also contained a nice coffee machine and a tablet for surfing the Internet - although the connection wasn't great. There was a minibar in the room however it was extortionate (as you would expect), about £2 for kitkat or a can of coke. 

The bed was huge and comfortable, however we were woken in the morning by what sounded like the ships engine preparing to depart! 

We made a visit to the bar area upon returning after our celebrations and found it pleasant, with a nice large decked area. 

The hotel required a £40 deposit when you checked in to cover any possible charges to the room, this was refunded when you checked out.

Overall I would highly recommend this hotel and definitely plan to make a visit again the next time I am in the Capital.",5,2015,01,15
119,Teresa Russell hood  weekend stay,"What a fantastic  place to stay something different , starting with mital who made our original booking to the helpful friendly Nazma  who went out of her way to upgrade us we stayed in room 4040 took our breath away felt like royalty , the bar staff day and night we helpful and also the resturant staff , the manager  Andreas  stays went out of his way to always speak to us a 5star stay will return in the summer",5,2015,01,15
119,Visit to the boat show,"We decided to stay at the Sunburn hotel as it was well located for the Excel and we  thought it looked a bit different maybe we set our expectations too high!  We found the hotel overpriced shabby and certainly didn't feel I was in a four star hotel 

We were expecting something a little special but unfortunately we were disappointed our room had a river view but this was pretty average (on par with a cross channel ferry) décor was shabby and carpets could have benefited from an upgrade.  Found the bed very uncomfortable it was two singles pushed together with a topper and door to balcony was jammed so gave up trying to attempt to go out onto the balcony - the tablet was a good idea in the room 

Breakfast was pretty average and expensive for a buffet in fact the Novo hotel adjacent was much better value for a good selection of cereals fruit juices and hot food

The Sunborn could be a beautiful very special hotel with some upkeep and decor improvements including the bizarre music played in the bar just a pity not there yet!",3,2015,01,14
119,Best Place for Partners Suprise Treat ,Planned a treat for my Girlfriend and decided to surprise her with a stay on the Sunborn  after the West End . What an amazing stay and absolutely luxurious feel to our night onboard . beautifully equipped room and what a stunning view of the O2 Dome etc as you stand on the ship . experienced a meal onboard at the restaurant which although expensive was as expected served immaculately. Maybe only criticism is menu could of been larger with more choice but overall it was brilliant. Staff were lovely and we left the Sunborn full of praise and sharing our night of Luxury with a twist in London . I've just had work round the corner so came back today to take a stunning picture of the Yacht . big thumbs up :),5,2015,01,14
119,Amazing place to stay in London,"A real difference to staying in a normal hotel. 

Me and my family booked a two night stay here, and it was the best decision we have made. Everything was so luxurious. I loved the art deco style of the rooms. Plus there was everything you needed in the rooms, it was spacious, big tv, coffee & tea machine, hairdryer and Molten Brown products in the bathroom.

The breakfast was great. Everything was amazing, I have no dislikes, and would definitely stay again.",5,2015,01,13
119,Anniversary over night stay with dinner ,"Was very excited to get a booking done on the Friday evening then checking in on the Sunday same week.
Was greeted by Nazma one of the managers on the desk. I felt immediately welcome & at ease. She was genuinely interested in why I was staying but my slight give away may have my 20 long stem roses to celebrate our 20 year anniversary? 
Nazma & Ichatted intensely about longevity of relationships & love in general. A very warm & obviously caring person. Further to our conversation she upgraded our room booking as a gesture good will & recognition to our 20 years together. She then personally showed me to our room discussing all the hotel features & offers. Amazing!
Thank you once again Nazma you made our stay even more special.
We had the best table in the restaurant too maybe Nazma organised that too? All food was stunning, though the cheese platter needs some work? Breakfast great too. Finally, my partner Ernest & Iwant to thank everyone, all staff at the Sunborn for being friendly & making our stay special! Kr Matthew Jordan-Jones ",5,2015,01,13
119,Treated like Royalty,Incredible food and clean room. Excellent room service. All the staff we spoke to had a good sense of humor and made us feel like royalty. Well worth every penny. A private party had booked the restaurant on our night which we could hear from the other end of the boat but the noise was gone by the time we wanted to sleep. Thank you!,5,2015,01,13
119,lovely Yacht....,"We stayed here one Saturday eve on December 13th as a treat and to help us fit in a Christmas concert with plenty of shopping. 
The Yacht is a fantastic change to the norm and the staff treated us very well, particularly Nazma on reception and the concierge.
The room was is optimum condition , very comfortable with a feeling of luxury.
The breakfast ran upto 11am the next morning ,so you can have a long lazy lie in.
I would definitely recommend it.",5,2015,01,12
119,Sunborn fun,"I booked two nights on Sunborn for my partners Christmas present. 
I then discovered it coincided with a girlfriends birthday so eight of us got together and hoped we could access our room earlier than the 3pm checkin.
The lovely receptionist arranged for our room to be available at 12.30 and after drinks at the bar served by a delightful young man we asked for champagne flutes and ice bucket to be delivered to our room.
This request was met with speed and courtesy and we were wished a happy time.
After lunch and returning to our room and bar our friends eventually left after 7 informing us that they had thoroughly enjoyed the experience. We stayed on for an ongoing brilliant time at Seaborn
We will most definitely return",5,2015,01,12
119,Just as good as I expected,"We were given an overnight stay in a double executive room as part of a major birthday present. The Yacht hotel has been completely refurbished fairly recently & is advertised as an upmarket venue so we were expecting it to be good & we weren’t disappointed. Our executive double room was large, comfortable & had the usual TV, free WiFi, coffee & tea making facilities. We had a balcony (quiet small) on the starboard side which faced due south, overlooking the old Victoria dock & swanky new apartment blocks on the other bank. The view over the old Victoria dock is pleasant enough but a bit sparse, just water but I think that’s better than overlooking the ExCel centre & bland grass square on the dark, port side of the Yacht. The dock doesn’t seem to be used for anything else at present so no marina, moored boats or floating restaurants to distract the eye but this maybe something coming in the future.

The room rates are not cheap & the restaurant/drinks prices are a little eye watering but no more than you should expect of a 5* hotel/restaurant in London & the a-la-carte dinner & full breakfast next morning were excellent. The Yacht is an excellent venue if you time your visit to coincide with one of the many exhibitions at the Excel centre (we went to the boat show) directly adjacent or a concert at the O2 arena on the opposite side of the Thames. You can get to the O2 via Docklands light railway & tube but take the opportunity to ride on the Emirates Air Line, a fantastic 10 minute cable car ride which is far more interesting & works out cheaper than the tube if you get the right ticket! No dedicated parking for Sunborn guests but ExCel have several car parks just a few minutes walk away; use the Victoria car park which has a flat £15 rate for 24 hours.

Overall a fabulous experience if you’re into boats, ideal for that very special occasion or if you’re taking in a nearby exhibition/show at ExCel or O2. Probably not a venue for the budget conscious & you can get cheaper hotel accommodation nearby but I will certainly consider staying on board again.",5,2015,01,12
119,Mr Wheel-House,"Amazing experience from the check in until the checkout. 
We both arrived with roses for our 20th anniversary and asked for 2 vases if possible.  These arrived quickly and the staff have been so friendly and also very chirpy. 
Always a hello including the ladies doing housekeeping. 
We were kindly upgraded to a suite, by the very lovely Nazma. So I for one wish to say Thankyou. 
The rooms were beautiful and the modern touches of an ipad and espresso machine were little thrills for me.
I now want an ipad and espresso machine. 
The bartender made us 2 perfect Tanquery 10 Martinis which went down very well.
We moved upstairs to Dinner and were treated incredibly well through the night.
The food was beautiful,  Matthew had scallops and I the cauliflower souffle both tasty and beautifully presented,  washed down with a glass of chardonnay and a glass of voigner Perfect. 
We both had Salt Marsh lamb, presented rose as requested. Washed down with a bottle of grand cru red for £80, stunning wine and a good price. 
Dessert was chocolate fondants which were gooey and salted caramel, we each had a glass of muscat as suggested and was a perfect compliment. 
The cheese board could more adventurous. 
I have already recommended the stay to several of my friends who are organising birthday treats for partners and we are already looking to go to the one in Gibraltar. 
an amazing experience Thank you to all whom made our stay perfect 👌 
It is a treasured day for us.",5,2015,01,12
119,A lovely surprise..............,"My wife and I stayed at the Sunborn London on the 10th January 2015 and what a lovely surprise it was. I booked the hotel on recommendation of a friend as a night away from the kids for my wife and myself. We were greeted at reception by a member of staff who welcomed us before directing us to check in. We had originally booked a dock view room but we were moved to a river view room. The room was spacious and the little touches in the room mage it special- Molton Brown toiletries, Lavazza Coffee machine etc. The buffet breakfast was great as the food was fresh and tasty. We have already booked a 2nd stay in May!",5,2015,01,12
119,floating romantic hotel,"This was a wedding anniversary treat. We had a river view room, very spacious and we were provided with complimentary cocktail vouchers to help us celebrate our event. A walk away from the Emirates skyline. Very helpful staff who helped us out with a problem we had with room service without any fuss or embarrassment. Breakfast is pricy but worth the money. A truly romantic experience and well worth the money.",5,2015,01,11
119,Luxury Birthday weekend,"I had the pleasure of spending a birthday weekend on the Sunborn, what a treat. Amazing rooms and food and cocktails were just perfect. A real novelty being on a yacht, although there was no movement so it did not feel like you were on water until you looked out. We had a room that did not have a balcony, but this did not bother us, the room itself was luxurious, with beautiful furniture a huge bed and great shower/wet room.
We had a champagne meal in the restaurant which was of a very high standard. For a romantic weekend in London this is ideal.",5,2015,01,11
119,staying on the Sunborn,"We have just stayed on The Sunborn Yacht Hotel, berthed in Royal Victoria Dock, in London, for 2 nights, Our room was amazing, with balcony overlooking Canary Wharf, o2 arena, excellent views of the cable car system between the North & South side of the Thames.
We had a 45min  massage each the first afternoon of our arrival, both girls were very friendly and professional, ate in the Restaurant in the evening, the table we requested was reserved, allowing us lovely views, they could not have been more helpful, the food was exquisite, with a very varied menu.
The restaurant was fully booked Saturday Evening for a private function, but they put out tables behind the bar to accommodate us and two visiting friends.
We must make a special mention of the receptionist, Nazma, whose attitude and professionalism made our stay all the more enjoyable, she made us feel very welcome.",5,2015,01,11
119,Excellent,It has a unique staff with 7 star manners and the space is extremely well designed.Nazma is the best help to enjoy your decisions at the front desk with her help.the bar is beautifully it has a good view and I can see entertainment for friends and business partners here for a long time.  It has to be the longest day to be in contact with the love boat where you do not miss any time and you are efficient 12 hours a day.  The food and drinks are of excellent quality and the parties can be organized  in the best most elegant shick way.,5,2015,01,11
119,Fantastic hotel!,My husband and I spent last night at the Sunborn Hotel in London. The hotel is impressive and the staff were all very friendly and helpful. Our room was stunning and the view amazing. There was lots to choose from at breakfast and all the staff worked hard to make everyone welcome. We would definitely recommend it and hope to stay there again one day soon.,5,2015,01,10
119,Wonderful!!!,"We had a fantastic stay and were sad to leave! Room, views, Service and spa massage brilliant (I think her name was Johanna). Will definitely come back and would recommend to friends! Staff very friendly and room very clean. Can't comment on the restaurant as thy were fully booked but menu looked lovely!  Thank you",5,2015,01,10
119,Fantastic....Unique 5* Yacht Hotel !,"My husband and I stayed on the Sunborn on New Years Eve. What a beautiful Yacht, located on the Royal Victoria Docks right beside the Excel Centre. We parked in the undercover Excel car park which cost £15 for 24 hours and your Car is safe there. 
She truly is a beautiful Yacht and well deserves the 5*.
Check In was smooth thanks to the wonderful receptionist Mital ! What a lovely lady so kind , welcoming and polite. Nothing was too much trouble.
We were also welcomed by Claudio, Sunborns concierge. What a lovely, happy, and kind man. Again,nothing was too much trouble.
We stayed in room 2014 which was a executive Kingsize which had the added bonus is a balcony , I also sent an email requesting a River View as this cannot be guaranteed. 
The room was a great size , the Sony Tablet positioned right beside the bed ,allowed you to access the Internet but also to inform you of all the yachts activities. Milton Brown products in the bathroom and dressing gowns and slippers were included as well as a coffee machine and tea making facilities.
There is a hairdryer set up ready in the bathroom and an Iron and ironing board in the ample wardrobe space along with a safe.
We upgraded from our dinner to their New Years Eve Gala ,5 course meal with a free glass of Champagne and a free half a bottle of wine each and bottled water. What a beautiful meal and the waiters were fantastic, they kept an eye on you to make sure the never waited too long and your glass was always full.
We saw midnight in on the yacht and went on deck and watched the fireworks.
When we returned to our room, we were treated by a beautiful card written by the Manager and a plate of gorgeous Macaroons.
The bed is large and very comfortable, and we slept really well, we opted out of breakfast as we were still full up from our 5 course meal, .
I would definitely recommend this wonderful Yacht. Don't think that staying in the East London, you're too far away, as the tube is literally 5 mins walk. You have The wonderful Emirates Cable car, which has packages which include the river ferries if wanted . The O2 with its many eateries, and also Tesco Express a 2 mins walk right by the Yacht.
I made a little video for you all to see",5,2015,01,10
119,Little gem in London,"Stayed for just one night in January as an unexpected treat.  We love experiencing new things and this was certainly that.

The interior decor was as you'd expect - very cruise ship esq, with gold and chandelier lighting.

The food was excellent - we had a 3 course meal and everything was presented well and tasted delicious.
Breakfast was also pleasant with plenty to choose from.

Our room was spacious and well presented.  Perhaps just the bathroom could have been a little nicer, as it felt a bit tired and small(despite being less than a year old).

All in all a great nights stay and would recommend. ",5,2015,01,10
119,For the sake of a couple of things.....,"What a superb place! a floating super-yacht within spitting distance of the London Excel. The welcome, from the staff coming over to the pedestrian barrier to collect our luggage and the welcome at reception, superb. Our room, a family suite, lovely. Good size and beautifully decorated (as is everything else we have seen on board). The staff are very friendly and helpful. The meal (dinner) was nicely presented and tasty. The turbot, being by far the most expensive thing on the menu, was disappointing. Not because it didn't taste nice, but because it wasn't special enough compared to the chicken. The bill for dinner already had a discretionary 12.5% service charge, bit cheeky because it would be rather awkward to remove it or part of it. The thing that really winds me up is that there was still a big open space on the bill for gratuity to be added too. On top of the 12.5%, that's seriously naughty! Needless to say, 12.5% is what they got. 
So, not having experienced breakfast yet; apart from 2 niggles, I can highly recommend it and will surely come back next time I find myself in the area. ",4,2015,01,09
119,Amazing place to stay,We stayed here after a day in London for my 25th birthday. We had a king size room. It was much bigger than I expected - lovely and clean. The staff on board were amazing and so helpful. We paid for breakfast the night before and were so glad we did. It was amazing! So much choice. Would definitely stay here again!,5,2015,01,07
119,Wonderful - Can't wait to go back,"Our one night stay was a Christmas present and it lived up in every aspect to the online description.  Staff were very welcoming and helpful from the very start. Our ""cabin"" was large and beautifully furnished.  The food in the restaurant was quite easily the best we have had in a long time and the service was excellent.  Breakfast was leisurely and again excellent.  A 5 star experience we have already recommended to many friends.  We left feeling we had done something really special and can't wait to return.  A 5 star experience in every respect!",5,2015,01,07
119,Probably The Best Place I've Ever Stayed,From walking on board to getting off we were treated like royalty the staff were polite happy helpful. The cabin was beautiful everywhere was spotless it was just perfect. I would like to name one  member of staff that was special but I can't as they all were. I was so lucky I found the boat online. I will be up again in the spring and will be treating my wife to a room with a balcony even though the room downstairs was bliss. I have worked in three 5 star hotel's in my working career and if I was young enough I would be applying for a job there as it is just perfect. For attention of owners and Management please look after the staff as well as they look after the guests you are so lucky to have such great staff!!,5,2015,01,06
119,Wow!,"Stayed here for one night with my boyfriend as a gift for my 21st birthday. 
It was a very enjoyable and lovely stay and the staff couldnt of been more helpful or attentive. Every staff member we saw over the 2 days said hello or wished us a good morning. When we got to the room i couldnt believe the size, definately large enough for the 2 of us and the bed was definately the biggest i have slept in. Our tv would not turn on, we told a staff member and within the hour of us eating our dinner in the resturant it was fixed. 
The resturant was amazing, we hadnt booked a table but were still given a table straight away and the food was 5*! 
We arrived at just gone 11am expecting to just store luggage as check in wasnt till 3pm but we were given our room straight away looking out over the river. 
We used the emirates cable cars to go back into central london for shopping and the views from this were spectacular. 
If you choose not to eat in the hotels resturant then there are lots of dining places around the area within a very short walk. 
The tablet in the room was a lovely touch in which you could do everything from and we used the complimentary wifi alot without a problem. 
Would definately reccomened this hotel and will stay here again! ",5,2015,01,06
119,STAYED NEW YEARS EVE AS A SPECIAL TREAT TO OURSELVES,"We booked the Sunborn as a special treat to ourselves to celebrate our last mortgage payment and couldn't of picked a better place to stay. We had a kingsize exec suite and it was to die for. The room was so spacious and clean, the bed was so comfy, it was perfect. We were made very welcome when we arrived and all the staff were so friendly. The new years eve party was a little disappointing but given that it was their first one, and apparently the DJ let them down at the last minute, it didn't turn out to be that bad. We had free drinks after midnight as a compensation. Breakfast the next morning was spot on. I would definately recommend this yacht to anyone wanting something a little different and special.
Well done to Andreas Stys and all his staff for making out stay so welcoming and comfortable.

We will be back

Karen & Sean Donnelly",5,2015,01,06
119,Something different,"Our family of three stayed here on Christmas Eve as a surprise for my husband's birthday. If you are after something a little different from the rest then this is the place. We were lucky enough to have a room on the river side with a balcony, not sure that the rooms facing the dock would have the same wow factor though. The beds were comfy and the room was large. The staff were extremely friendly and helpful. We had dinner that night in the restaurant, and the food was amazing. You get what you pay for. As a birthday treat the whole experience lived up to expectations and was worth every cent.",5,2015,01,05
119,great hotel,"the, good wow was our 1st words on entering our room, king size bed, flat screen tv, tablet with free wifi coffee machine kettle and tea bags, all very clean and shiny, great bathroom nice towels and shower gel shampoo etc , the not so good only 4 little milk cups ,really you could do with double that, my wife and I walked 5 mins to a Tesco express and bought a little milk, snacks etc,as breakfast was £20 each, a 2 course meal in Jamie olivers  is £19, so we didn't have breakfast, a fair price would be £10 and far more people would use that service. also watching the news on tv was fine but when a movie came on in the evening the screen was very dark and could hardly make out what was happening so tried to use remote to brighten screen only for a not avalable sign to come up on screen so left that went on tablet to watch you tube but tablet had no sound,theres only one button on side but this did not work it, also the room was very hot i turned heating off but it was still very hot i was in room 2026 i think with a nice view of the river, reception service was great very polite and helpful ,if we go again we would love a room with a balcony for some fresh air as you cannot open window, but not sure if my bank balance can stretch that far, saying that we still had a great time, and would think of going again for a treat",4,2015,01,05
119,1 Night Break,"Booked Through Secret Escapes - Authentic & Different, Staff Friendly and helpful, Food Excellent, Rooms have all they need impressed with the smart TV and coffee machine in our Executive Double although a little disappointed with the discomfort of the bed. A great unique break although not much going on.",4,2015,01,05
119,Fantastic Experience,"My wife and I stayed here on New Year's Eve. Apart from the view from our room which was facing the dock and not the river and the awful WIFI service I couldn't fault the place. Staff were very friendly, the rooms are big and very well furnished. The beds are super comfy and the shower is nice and powerful. The bar is a nice place to have a drink and look out over the view of Canary Wharf with all the lights. The yacht is only a stone's throw from the Emirates cable car and DLR. I would definitely stay here again.",4,2015,01,05
119,Great wow factor!,"I booked this as a post Christmas treat for my partner. The boat certainly lived up to our expectations and the room was large and well equipped with a view over the water. The staff were very polite and helpful and the location was convenient being only a short walk fron the DLR (Customs House)
We dined there during the evening and the food was good albeit not cheap but then you have to weigh up the whole experience as the view is outstanding. My only criticism is that out of four deserts on the menu (excluding the cheese board) only two listed were available which seems a lack of planning bearing in mind the size of the menu!
Breakfast at the weekend is £10 per head and half price compared with weekdays. The food and selection was good but I'm not sure if I would have paid the full price if staying during the week.
If you want to try something that's a little different, or to impress someone, then it's well worth a try and I'd definately return.",5,2015,01,04
119,What an experience one to be repeated,"Our first experience of this kind of stay and what a wonderful experience it was.  We booked a break in between christmas and new year and stayed on the Sunborn.  The booking in was a little slow on reception but due to a lot of people booking in at the same time, the staff did apologise about keeping us waiting and offered us a drink which we thought was nice.  The room was wonderful and gave you the cruise ship experience.  We had a drink in the bar overlooking the river and watching the Emirate ride it was a truly wonderful time.  Watching the sun setting completed our evening.  Did not have breakfast at the hotel as thought it was a little over priced.  Had a slight hiccup with the lift trying to leave the hotel, but the staff dealt with this.  Would recommend you give it a try well worth it.  Had an ipad in the room with WIFI so you did not have to worry about taking your own devices",5,2015,01,04
119,Great hotel yacht ,"Stayed here Friday night , great place , staff very friendly , cocktails very nice , great views , room we had a king classic was really nice , only downside I would say as I am disabled there was a lot of raised steps in between the doorways and a large one in the bathroom room , overall great place to stay ,  ",5,2015,01,03
119,Brilliant Concept Brilliant Stay,"Booked this as a treat for my partners birthday as we'd come down for a west end show (mamma mia brill ) . she was overjoyed by the thought of our "" floatel "" and only found out on route by the taxi driver remarking how lucky to stay there . Room was fantastic and maybe I should of gone for a opening balcony for my partner but the fixed window was enough for me . the overall feel was brilliant and the service was ace . room service had a mix up with a order but said it would be complimentary so good to see quick to resolve . the restaurant was very nice although the ala carte menu could of done with more choice and its a little expensive but you get brilliantly presented food . I emailed for a double bed rather than twin beds pushed together to make a king size but overall I slept fine . great in room Sony tablet to use and feel for me was it was a Brilliant treat for my partner and access in to  central London was fine . If anyone is staying here the view at the rear is stunning as from restaurant or bar you see the whole of Canary Wharf and the O2 dome and at night has a beautiful feel to it . DLR line right near so good for getting into London and if using a taxi in ask the driver to go to the Novotel/Ibis hotel as our driver took us to the wrong side of the exhibition Centre which made us a fair walk down by the riverside ( nice tho but partner was in heels so not as appreciative ) .

Staff Fantastic 
Experience Fantastic 
Room Fantastic 
Cleanliness 9 out of 10 ( ensuite only let it down )
Unique Feel and would come again .",5,2015,01,03
119,want to treat someone?,"hi,
What can I say , if I say its really great it always be booked , bad news for me .
I booked this as a special surprise for my wonderful girlfriend Margaret.
Her face said it all , first time she has actually been speechless, absolutely wonderful.
Claudio greeted us and made us feel welcome like old friends.
We stayed on the fifth deck and was simply smiling all the time.
Wonderful tasty dinner complete with champagne and wine and waited for the sky to be lit up by the fire works . 

Extended buffet breakfast up till 13:00 was a welcome bit off news and a check out at 14:00 made it even better.

There is the Excel 100 yards away and the O2 reachable by cable car if needed.
A selection of shops and bars close by .
Docklands light railway is close by .
Docklands airport near by but could not hear anything from cabin.
Stratford main railway station about 30 mins away
If you dont know London take a peek on the map to get a idea of travel etc as can be a nightmare if you get lost!!

We will come back in the summer sometime if there is room!
Sad to go as staff were second to none, especially Claudio

All in all a superb stay......go ahead treat someone 

Please dont book up as we want to be able to go back.",5,2015,01,02
119,Sitting on the dock of the bay....,"Fantastic place to stay :-)
Massive room even though it was the standard room.
Fabulous view of the river and the O2.
Nice touch with the iPad.  
Parking only £15 overnight by the Excel.
5 minute walk to cable car across to the O2. Night crossing was great with brilliant views. Closes before concerts end but train back was quick and easy.
Staff were outstanding. Very friendly and helpful. Nazma was excellent.
Breakfast was nice although a bit cold which was a shame.
Also had run out of pastries :-(
Would highly recommend a stay in this yummy yacht :-)",5,2015,01,02
119,Absolutely Wonderful !!!,"Stayed here 2 nights to see in the 2015 New Year .
Arrived on 30 th Dec.From the moment you arrive it does not disappoint ...the yacht is superb.
We stayed in a double executive room on the 3rd deck with balcony and river view ... Room terrific ..luxurious .
What a bonus at midnite  ... The fireworks were amazing from all directions across the river .... Superb !! 
Thoroughly recommend it ... Fabulous place to stay..staff excellent.",5,2015,01,01
119,Made me feel like someone famous!,"I booked the yacht last minute as I had a show to go to in London the next day.  I got a very good deal, and it had been on my to do list for some while.  The approach to the lady is rather grand as she sits there overlooking Excel square, rather a funky location.  As you approach the entrance canopy you really get a sense of doing something rather special.

The reception staff were impeccably dressed and welcoming and just added to the feeling of top notch accommodation.  The venue is spotless and gleaming.  

I had a classic room which was bigger than most Hotel rooms I have stayed in, beautifully finished, and again, everything shining and bright.  Simple luxury.  I had a 2nd level room which had an oval shaped porthole overlooking the dockside.

Wifi available in the room, meant I could luxuriate the following morning in bed.

There are plenty of restaurants nearby if you do not want to eat on board, however the onboard restaurant menu looked delicious and if I hadnt had other plans, I would definitely have eaten there.

If the price was right I would stay again without hesitation.  A lovely end to my Christmas wanderings.   

Oh, and the accommodation areas are incredibly quiet!!!",5,2015,01,01
119,New Years eve,Fantastic hospitality come back to our room to find a hand written letter welcoming us and some macaroons. Great room over looking the thames well furnished and great location for the sights of London. Have book to come back on two other dates. ,5,2015,01,01
119,Brilliant Stay,"A last minute booking and we couldn't recommend this hotel more.
The staff were extremely pleasant and helpful, when we advised that the children would be joining us they arranged for a family room.
We ate at the restaurant on the first night and the food was very good.

We will be coming back to stay.

Thank you for a lovely stay.   ",5,2014,12,30
119,Surprise Trip,"I booked for two nights as a surprise getaway for my husband and we were not disappointed.  On early arrival we were lucky enough to be offered an upgrade and the room was just perfect as it had a balcony and a view of the Thames and Canary Wharf - thank you Sunborn.  The check-in was quick and the staff very friendly and informative.  In particular Claudio and Romao were very helpful.  The room was spotless, the bed very comfortable and the facilities excellent.  This is probably the best hotel we have stayed in when visiting London.  Although the Yacht is further out of the city than we are used to the transport links were good and we enjoyed the experience of taking the cable car to the O2 and then using the river taxi into the city.  We would certainly stay again and will be recommending the Sunborn to our friends and family.  There is only one negative point which many others have commented on.  I think the Full English Breakfast can be improved upon as the bacon was insipid and the beans, etc. not very hot.",5,2014,12,30
119,London trip,"An amazing hotel , the best bed I've ever slept in an amazing room an amazing shower !! This boat hotel is a brilliant idea, it's 20 mins from tower bridge , ideal for exploring the east end , we went on the cable car which is near by , breakfast was very nice , ",5,2014,12,30
119,Very friendly and helpful.,"Definitely somewhere different to stay, Claudio the concierge was very friendly and helpful. It was my Husbands birthday and we were given complimentary cocktails. The cabins are a good size and the view from the balcony and sunset was beautiful. A great place to stay in London thats a little bit extra special.",4,2014,12,30
119,Joint 40s birthday night,"My friend and I met here after both turning 40 we wanted somewhere special to celebrate and we were not disappointed what a wonderful place to stay 
Checked in at 3 and were greeted by a lovely lady who couldn't of been nicer in if she tried.
The room was amazing with a fantastic view of the Thames everything was clean and tidy.10 out of 10 
We spent all evening at the bar the bar tender Nicola was soooooo lovely looked after us all evening polite and professional 
Highly recommended and have booked to go again twice next year
Thank you to everyone there for making our birthday so special",5,2014,12,29
119,Very comfortable.,"With the looks of a small cruise ship, the Sunborn shines with polished wooden and chrome surfaces. The cabins are larger than most hotel rooms and extremely comfortatable. There is a tablet computer in each cabin, and free wifi. Parking is at the Royal Victorian Docks car park, or the Excel car park, which at £15 for 24 hours is cheaper than the hotel parking at the neighbouring Crowne Plaza or Ibis. The buffet breakfast was £10 p.p. and was lovely. The range of fruit, cereals, toast, continental meats and cheeses, of full English fry-up is extensive. Short walk to the DLR for connections to the Underground and the sights of London. The next time we want to visit the O2, or see a London show, we'll choose the Sunborn again.",5,2014,12,29
119,Fantastic but !!!!,"We stayed here for our first wedding anniversary from Wales The yacht and staff especially Nazma were excellent and concierge could not be faulted even taking our cases to the taxi rank when we departed .The yacht is spotless cocktails are brilliant and our room we could not fault. But we run our own cafe in Wales with excellents on trip advisor so come on chefs on sunborn get this bacon & sausages sorted put it in the oven or under the grill to give it some colour 
People in the queue when I was there was commenting on how uncooked the bacon and sausage looked and yes the beans were not hot. So a few tweaks with breakfast and one more comment please could we have ice machines on room decks would be great .But hey your great !!!",5,2014,12,29
119,"Absolutely Excellent, Highly Recommend","Arrived On Fri 26th Dec 14, The Staff Were So Friendly And Very Helpful, Nothing Was Too Much Trouble For Them.
The Food Was Excellent And The Service Throughout Our Stay Was Superb, Would highly recommend And I Would Have No Hesitation To Stay There Again, Looking Forward To My Next Visit Soon.",5,2014,12,29
119,Excellence on a yacht,"On the evening 22nd December we stayed at the Sunborn yacht hotel to celebrate my husbands 70th Birthday. The hotel is beautiful and the rooms were wonderful with every comfort catered for. We had been upgraded to a river view which was stunning, in the sunshine of the next morning. What sets this hotel apart from others we have stayed in around the world was the staff, they could not have been more friendly or helpful without exception. They made the experience and I cannot thank them enough. I would throughly recommend this hotel to everyone, it is easy to get to by train or there is car parking for £15.00 a night opposite. A truly wonderful experience.",5,2014,12,29
119,Wonderful,"we stayed on Saturday 27th December . Checked in early  as we were going to a matinee show. Was not expecting too, other than leaving our bags. Room was lovely very clean with river view. Every member of staff was polite and helpful at all times . Breakfast was really good 10 out of 10. I would love to stay again.",5,2014,12,28
119,amazing hotel and staff,"we stayed 2 nights, we had dinner there the first night and it was amazing. the staff very helpful and friendly.   the rooms very spaceous and luxurious.   we had most relaxing time there.  would highly recomend it",5,2014,12,28
119,AmaZinG,"This was booked as a special 40th birthday trip, we requested a river view and were thrilled to be upgraded when checking in early.  The staff were fabulous, all very helpful and polite, Hugo the shift manager approached us and let us know he was available if there were any problems.  We booked a 3 course champagne meal and it was delicious, again service by staff was great.  Cocktails 'with a kick' in the bar afterwards were enjoyed in a relaxed atmosphere.   We enjoyed an a la carte Breakfast the following day which was equally as good.  We would recommend this hotel as a perfect way to celebrate a special occasion.  We are already planning to rebook for early next year when visiting the ExCel Centre.",5,2014,12,28
119,Teething problems.....,"So, we booked an executive room with river view and a champagne dinner for Boxing day. Apart from taking forever to get across London, there were NO signs for The Sunborn what so ever. We drove around for an hour in the pouring rain and still we could not find it. I phoned 5 times and no one answered the phone. Eventually, we spotted the sign on the boat but could not get access to the entrance. We parked in the Excel center at a cost of £15.00 and walked in the rain to the hotel. When we arrived, there was a lift with no instructions until you got in the lift and read where reception was. Finally, we made it to reception. After explaining how badly signed the hotel was and how soaked we had got due to no cover to the hotel, the receptionist appologised and said "" I will upgrade you to an executive room with river view"" I burst out laughing as that was what we had paid for already. ""oh, sorry"" she replied, we were shown to our room, no explanation regarding the mini bar, coffee machine (pod system) or tablet wifi. No paperwork in the room regarding breakfast times etc. We eventually went down to dinner after receiving a call from reception appologising for all the mishaps and offering us a free breakfast which would have been the ridiculous price of almost £20.00 per head. The waiter was excellent and very good at his job, my husband ordered a mixed salad with his meal and got a bowl of green beans but apart from that he was very courteous and helpful. The food was ok apart from the bread pudding with meringue which was absolutely tasteless. The room was spotless and had excellent decor, the bed very comfortable and in the morning , the breakfast was good with plenty of choice. I think , as they had smoked salmon and scrambled egg, they could have stretched to a glass of champagne for the price. I would say it was GOOD, but there is no box for that.  I can not say it was excellent as for over £200.00 for 1 night + food and drink, I feel they need to iron out some of the problems. The place was half empty and sadly, I can see why... You need cover for people arriving so they do not get soaking wet, clear directions of where to park and how to travel on foot from the car park to the hotel and the presence of a manager to at least make it look like some one is taking note of these things.",4,2014,12,27
119,A little bit different.,"Stayed at the sunburn the night before an event at the O2.
Excellent location for the O2 but out of the way for central London.
We had a family room booked through booking.com at a reduced rate. 
The staff were excellent, the cleanliness superb and our standard family room was plenty large enough for me, my wife and two young girls.
Would definitely stay here again.",5,2014,12,27
119,A very Merry Christmas,"We booked this last minute. But we're not disappointed. It has made our Christmas really special and relaxing. We were greeted by the lovely staff one of whom brought our huge amount of luggage from the car. The yacht is clean, friendly and impressive. The staff are an absolute credit and nothing too much trouble very attentive which was really appreciated. The breakfast is plentiful and varied and was a great start to the day overlooking the O2 and Canary Wharf the Christmas lunch was lovely with a good atmosphere a special mention to Alessandro whose service really stood out. We would recommend and definitely return. The only downside is it needs to be better signposted as it's difficult to find because the sat Nav dosent pick it up but it was well worth the search! ",5,2014,12,25
119,Beautiful but disappointed,"I stayed with my fiancé one night on the Sunborn - amazing place to stay, very plush and luxurious with breathtaking views of canary wharf and the O2 - you must have a drink in the bar to watch the sun setting. Table service in the bar was however very slow. We took the Emirates airline over to the O2 to watch Madness! Great location. We had booked in for breakfast the next day - how disappointing tho! View was brilliant! Food was not! This is supposed to be a 5 star hotel - the breakfast was very bad buffet style - bacon looked insipid! Didn't bother trying - sausages hard as was the fried eggs, mushrooms had no taste and the baked beans Luke warm! Yuk! Gave up and had some tinned peaches and yoghurt - coffee was bitter too! Would stay at the hotel again but would not eat there! If they can't get breakfast right - I wouldn't like to try their dinners! ",4,2014,12,25
119,Last Minute Hotel,"Stayed here after a flight cancellation and re-arrange for City Airport early the next day.  Rooms are very nice and the check-in etc was good.

On arriving in room the A/C wasnt working, and with no opening windows, the room was very very hot.  We immediately called reception and mentioned when we went out to dinner.  Assured they would look at it.  On returning the room it appeared nothing had been done and the room was still boiling hot.  New person on reception didn't know anything about it. So we decided that we would just have to leave it and had an average nights sleept.
Mentioned again on paying/checking out in the morning, and the guy on reception knew nothing about it, didnt apologise or offer a discount....

I think this was an unfortunate episode, however I would have expected at least an apology or an offer of reduction in price [previously I have had up to 50% reduction just for fire alarm going off in other hotels].",3,2014,12,24
119,Thoroughly spoilt!,"We stayed at this hotel as part of a group for a friends 70th celebrations. Our stay far surpassed our expectations. All the accommodation was superb from the moment we stepped aboard.
The staff went the extra mile to ensure our ditsy was perfect. They were very attentive and professional. Our room was loverly with a very comfortable bed and sumptuous bedlinen. One of our gripes when we stay away is usually the shower but this was great, hot, instant and spacious.

Nazma on reception was a star in assisting with the luggage trolley while my husband parked the car. A shame we could not have closer access to at least unload the car. 

I wish I could have had time yo use the Spa but perhaps next time!",5,2014,12,24
119,Surprise birthday treat,"We stayed for a night at Sunborn for my boyfriend's birthday. The service received was excellent and we really enjoyed our stay there. Thank you so much for upgrading the room- we found the room spacious with very comfortable bed, very clean and really liked the coffee machine in the room. We had dinner at the restaurant there, the service was again excellent.. my only complaint would be that the portions could perhaps be a little bit more. Overall, it was a pleasant stay and we would definitely stay again. Thanks to all the staffs.",5,2014,12,23
119,Madness O2,"We stayed here as we're going to O2 to see Madness.

What a fabulous hotel, the rooms were great and the bar amazing views.

The staff were all lovely and helpful, check in a little slow! But otherwise first rate.

I would recommend this hotel to anyone, stay here at least once ",5,2014,12,23
119,Stay before O2 Madness,"We stayed here before Madness at the O2, a pre christmas treat,

Whata fantastic hotel, as you walk up it looks fantastic and it totally continues on board,my only gripe would be check in and check out were very slow, but the staff are all really good and want to help you.

The rooms are a good size with everything you should need and the breakfast was a good choice, not quite 5* but nice. I really enjoyed the time on board and would recommend to anyone to stay here at least once! 

Thanks for a lovely weekend.",5,2014,12,23
119,Surprising hotel in London,"I stayed at the Sunborn Hotel Yacht in November 2014. City Airpot is just 10 min away from the yacht-hotel. What an experience, great location, superb service and amazing atmosphere. At night very calm and during early morning great jogging route along the river Themse. This hotel is definitely a must-go for families or couples searching for a different type of hotel experience.",5,2014,12,23
119,Sunborn 16th Dec,"Unique location and ideal for the O2 We wouldn't stay anywhere else for that side of town. Excellent facilities excellent staff.

The cable car over the river to the arena is a must as is lunch in the Sunborn restaurant.",5,2014,12,23
119,Fab night away,"This boat was truly lush.
Took my husband away for the night for his birthday .
Large spacious room with a big bed, also a sofa which was very comfy.
2 minutes walk away, we had a look over the docklands from the virgin emirates cable cars.",5,2014,12,21
119,"Excellent hotel and by far the best I have stayed in, in London","Just returned from a superb night at the Sunborn. Real luxury with staff who are attentive, professional, and helpful. Nothing too much trouble. All areas are superb and would highly recommend. Write up and hotel pictures don't do it justice. Definitely stay again.",5,2014,12,21
119,Amazing,"We spent Saturday 20th December here as we were going to see madness at the 02 . The staff were fantastic nothing too much trouble
 Room was amazing with a coffee machine large tv and your own tablet. Bar staff brilliant when we came back from concert. Breakfast outstanding we were seated straight away with loads of choice. Full English scrambled egg and smoked salmon.  Cereals and pastries
This place is a must will definitely be returning. ",5,2014,12,21
119,"Great location, lovely hotel, staff struggling","The hotel is lovely, but clearly still getting to grips with being fully booked. 
The room and all the facilities are great, and the location is perfect for the Excel.
Breakfast however was a complete farce with huge queues and most things having run out. The poor staff were completely overwhelmed and the systems in place were totally unable to keep up with the demand.
Checkin and checkout were not a huge amount better, but I think that given a few months the customer service will have improved and it will be a really top notch place to stay. The management are aware of this and are trying to sort it out, but have not yet succeeded.

We were dock side, which was disappointing (but I understand that someone has to be) and next to the door into the corridor. This was extremely heavy and slammed every time anyone went in or out. It was also not working properly, so everyone stood outside and discussed how to get in loudly outside our door. The boxing match at the Excel meant that there were a lot of late night/early morning comings and goings outside our rooms, which was not conducive to a good nights sleep.
Fortunately the bed was one of the most comfortable I have stayed in, so getting back to sleep was not too hard!
Overall, the hotel is lovely - new and shiny with very plush fixtures and fittings, but was noisy and they need to get the service sorted out.",3,2014,12,20
119,Fabulous,"This had been recommended to us and what a recommendation. Outside of London but easy to get to ( alongside EXCEL) this was a great place to stay. Rooms were superb, with variable views. We had view of the river.
Staff were exceptionally good, Oyinda and Stefano were our usual link and they looked after us really well. Will stay here again.",5,2014,12,19
119,Great stay,Me and my mum stayed here and had the best weekend. I'm going back in January with hubby just for nite. The only down fall was breakfast not enough staff was on. But it was a great pleasure to stay here. The rooms we're beautiful and the bed was to die for!!!!,4,2014,12,19
119,Aamazing Time on the Beautiful Yacht Hotel!,"The hotel was booked for my birthday and I couldn't of stayed at a better place, the staff made me feel like royalty. The Yacht is sensational, the room and the facilities were first rate. It was lovely to be greeted by Claudio, he was very helpful with informing us, wheres good to go in London. Also like to say thank you to Nazma for dealing with any request me and by partner had. The breakfast in the morning was also superb, I couldn't fault the hotel in anyway I would recommend it to anyone. 
The emirates cables are also a 5 minute walk, they are a must!",5,2014,12,19
119,Exquisite gem of a hotel,"Simply magnificent. Not sure what makes a 5* hotel (the Sunborn is listed as 4*) but this yacht hotel certainly spanks some of the 5* hotels that I have stayed in. I booked two nights here for our wedding night as a treat to the wife and I before we flew out on our honeymoon. Usually I never leave a note in the “comment” section when I book a hotel but this time I thought I’ll give it a shot and I thank my lucky stars that I did.

The yacht is beautifully stunning. It is a gem to look at and certainly (justifiably) demands your attention and admiration. The area outside the entrance is well kept and aptly mood lit which evoked emotions of glee as my wife and I walked on board. These feelings were magnified once we stepped on board. Quality oozed everywhere from the glass lifts, marble floors and golden chandeliers. We arrived at the hotel sometime well after 1am after a whirlwind wedding day. Needless to say we were both shattered but still had ample amounts of adrenaline coursing through our veins. The receptionist who greeted us was very courteous and genuinely appeared excited and happy to share the following good news with us. We had been upgraded to a suite as a wedding gift from management. *Wow* generosity in London really does exist! I was more than happy having the standard room that I had booked but to be upgraded made my wedding night all the more special.

The management weren't through in gifting us. They had a bottle of champagne waiting on ice along with a handwritten note congratulating our union with best wishes for the future and wishing us a pleasant stay which of course we had. Personally, I feel the handwritten note was very kind of them and speaks a lot of the thought and care they clearly put into the comfort of their guests. I still have this note which is on display along with my wedding cards.

The suite was a jewel. Quality rich finishing throughout, marble bathroom, separate dining and seating area and a large separate bedroom with private balcony. The carpet throughout was thick, soft and comfy and a treat to the feet. There were large LCD smart TVs in both rooms along with a Sony Xperia tablet which you could use to browse the Internet, order room service and find out about the local area along with other features. We didn't have dinner but if breakfast was anything to go by I can only imagine it to be fantastic. If the quality of the breakfast was not evident from the first glance it certainly was from the first bite. The smoked salmon was divine as was our view from our table which overlooked the river with the cable cars in the background against a backdrop of a crisp, clear blue sky.

I promise you booking this hotel is one of the best choices one can make when it comes to looking for accommodation. You will not be disappointed. If you want to stay in the East London area and close to Canary Wharf and Greenwich then honestly don’t both looking any further than here.

Thank you Sunborn London for capping off my wedding day with the surprise upgrade and gifts. That was very kind and generous of you. We both thoroughly enjoyed our stay in the exquisite suite and hotel. We look forward to our return stay on-board.
Kind regards,

Mr and Mrs Peters",5,2014,12,18
119,A unique place to stay,"If you are happy to be slightly out of the centre of london for business or pleasure then this is a place that's well worth thinking about.

Access is by the DLR and the hotel itself is very well done, the reception area bars and restaurants are lovely as are the rooms.

Views vary depending on what room you are in but some have balcony as well and it's a novel place to stay. 

Would highly recommend if you are in this part of London for business or pleasure, plenty of local bars and restaurants etc.",4,2014,12,18
119,This hotel is a must!!!,"Wow, what can I say, stayed here for one night in Dec for my friends 50th birthday, every single thing about this hotel is first class, a special thank you to Sandra & Claudio for being so very helpful & friendly. We will definitely be going back. 5 Star Service!!!!",5,2014,12,16
119,Hotel stay with a difference!,"Stayed here for a Christmas present to my nephews, so that we could attend a concert at the O2.
The whole experience could not be improved upon.
The Yacht is beautiful, the room and facilities first rate.
The staff are all very personable, cheerful and helpful and you are made to feel as if you are the only person they are having to deal with.The concert for War of the Worlds was brilliant but the icing on the cake (particularly for two young men aged 11 and 14 years) was the stay at the Sunborn.",5,2014,12,15
119,Try something different,"Having done a few cruises in the past we were tempted by the Sunborn as interesting alternative to a London hotel. From the moment you exit the lift into the lobby you know you are in for a treat! The ship is very well fitted out and the cabin is the best we have ever stayed in. We had a balcony overlooking the dock with plenty of sights to take in. The staff are excellent, very friendly and professional. The buffet breakfast is a steal at the £10 weekend rate with a wide choice; we went for the traditional English which was very tasty, fresh, quality produce. Transport via the DLR is easy, and the cable car to the O2 is worth a go. All in all a great experience give it a try you won’t be disappointed.",5,2014,12,15
119,Excellent,"Very comfortable rooms with excellent sound insulation and pleasant temperature.
Excellence service, all very friendly and helpful customer satisfaction.
Very good bar service, I recommend the cocktails.",5,2014,12,15
119,Amazing,"Went 3 days with my work team and it was amazing.The staff were lovely, and I have to say that was wonderfull found some portuguese team. They were amazing and make me fell proud of my country. All the receptionist were kindly, but once again the portuguese help us with maps, places to see, etc...It was nice to see that there's staff from other countries too. Well done to all...
would love to comeback.

119,Excellence with a capital E,"Arrived late on Friday night and right from the first glimpse of this Hotel it looked excellent.The reception staff greeted us and made us feel at home the first moment you arrived and even collected my bags from the car whilst I drove to a near by car park and my partner was taking to the bar area and offered a cocktail.
This was a special occasion for my partners birthday and it did not let us down one bit.
The room was exceptionable, like a bedroom, lounge and bathroom with a large shower in fact it is bigger rooms than some hotel rooms put together.
The décor is beautiful and carpet is plush, the entrance with the spiral staircase makes you wonder if you are not on a ocean liner.
The staff are all helpful, reception helped out when organising the flowers in the room,the bar staff are so polite as are the waiters and waitresses at breakfast time.
Nothing was too much and to see so many people working and happy with their jobs made us feel more happier.
Spotless is a word I have to use, the yacht exceptionable, the staff well mannered well dressed and the rooms are all out of this world.
The hotel is situated in a lovely place and the view from the dining room out across the water to the O2 and Canary Wharf is amazing.
All in all this is by far the best hotel I have stayed in and I forgot the bed was so comfortable I had my first great sleep in years.
Would I go back again, would I recommend it, no need to answer am already looking at going back, and already recommened it to many friends, all in all this is not a 4 or 5 star hotel it should be a 10 star golden hotel.",5,2014,12,15
119,Really very good,"Stayed here for my wife's special birthday.....2 nights which were fabulous.
The STAR was a very wonderful receptionist who remembered my name although yacht was well booked and took the time to talk to me. Very professional and a very enjoyable experience. Plus, amazing views.",5,2014,12,14
119,Amazingly Special.,"We have just returned from the Sunborn Yacht Hotel in London, where we spent the weekend celebrating my husbands 50th. It was incredible, right from when we checked in the service was top class. The reception staff all wished my husband a happy birthday, and then up graded us to a junior Thames facing Suite. This was totally unexpected. We were treated first class all the way. Our room on the third floor had a beautiful view of the Thames as promised, we had clear views of Canary Wharf and the cable car. The room was extremley comfortable and oppulent, the bed was very comfortable, bathroom equipped with Molton Brown products. We had dinner on board in the Landsend restaurant, wow! delicious food and wine. Very professional staff, we never even noticed our wine glasses being refilled. We had cocktails in the bar that were very good. A great sleep was had by all three of us. My 9 year old daughter was very well catered for as well. We also had breakfast on board which was buffet style both cooked and continental. Plenty of food (again!) I would highly recommend the Sunborn, great for a special event. The staff were very professional and clearly their aim is to make your stay a memorable one...ours certainly will be.",5,2014,12,14
119,A little bit of London heaven,"From the moment we arrived we were emurced in a world of opulence and comfort.
The yaucht is positioned in Royal Victoria dock. A beautiful white vessel which takes on a special lit view at night. 
Your neighbours are the mellenium dome, docklands and the Emirates cable cars.
The staff couldn't do more for us. So friendly and very child friendly. My daughters are already begging us to bring them back. 
Nazma on the customer welcome desk was charming. My girls loved her. but all the staff we encountered were amazing.
I cannot rate this stay more highly.
We will definitely be back in 2015 !!",5,2014,12,14
119,Lovely,"Great looking room, incredibly comfy king sized bed! Very quit with a nice view of the Thames. Ensuite espresso machine and a great selection of wiality booze in the hotel bar.
Would highly recommend and wouldn't hesitate to come back.",5,2014,12,11
119,Everyone must stay here,"Me and my partner stayed here and it was incredible, he actually proposed to me on the top deck at night, and the veiw was breathtaking. The staff were lovely and I don't think there was one member of staff that passed us without saying good morning or good afternoon. Highly recommend the sunborn yacht hotel.",5,2014,12,11
119,One unforgettable night.,"I was treated to one night in this wonderfully unusual hotel by my girlfriend, it was to celebrate a milestone in my life. I hadn't expected the stay in London to be on a luxury Yacht moored on the Thames, I was utterly thrilled when I saw the Sunborn, and remained thrilled for the short time we were there. All the people who worked on board were lovely, especially Maryiam and Claudio, who went he extra mile/knot to make us feel special, they were cheery, genuine, helpful and warm. My girlfriend and I will definitely be staying here again, it was a first class experience. The hotel was immaculate, the bed fabulously comfortable, and the location was great too, only 2 minutes from the nearest DLR station. 10/10.",5,2014,12,09
119,surprise,"Arrived yesterday for a surprise birthday, got to the reception friendly, polite couldn't do enough for you, went through to the bar again the bar staff very helpful , polite couldn't offer more of a service 5star plus easy. Went up to the restraunt for dinner, menu was lovely I had scallops very fresh the main was cod which again was excellent. The whole night we were looked after highly recommend we will be back. We checked one of the rooms out it was absolutely gorgeous, if you haven't been please go",5,2014,12,09
119,Winter Wonderland family stopover.,"Decided to book the Sunborn for something different and was not disappointed! Lovely hotel, great bedrooms and top quality beds. No noise in the night at all and both myself and my wife slept till 9am followed by a lovely buffet breakfast. Staff couldn't be more helpful trying at every opportunity to give service.We ate at the Italian restaurant across from the hotel which was lovely.
Only downside here is the length of time it took to get to and from the city via the underground but time of year didnt help i guess. Taxi would have been better i think. Overall a lovely place.",5,2014,12,09
119,Something a little bit different.,"We decided that we would like to do something special as we had family visiting from Ibiza. We live a long way outside London so wanted to book a hotel and a restaurant. We found the Sunborn as part of an Internet search and it looked so interesting. A beautiful yacht moored at Victoria Dock. The restaurant menu looked really special so we decided to book a room and the restaurant. 

We were not disappointed. The reception area was stunning with a beautiful sweeping staircase. The staff were very helpful at check in. The room was lovely with gorgeous views over the Thames and the 02 was almost in touching distance! 

There were good quality toiletries in the bathroom ( Molton Brown) and dressing gowns and slippers. I would have preferred a towelling gown instead of the thin waffle type but this was only mildly disappointing.

We had a few cocktails before dinner and the ambience in the bar was good. The restaurant was 
lovely, the staff friendly and attentive. 

There was a self service breakfast the next morning, this was fine however I feel that coffee and tea should have been served at the table rather than having to get it yourself.

So all in all I highly recommend this hotel.",5,2014,12,08
119,First class,"My partner surprised me this weekend with a stay on the Sunborn.  Upon arrival we were greeted by staff and we're able to check in early.  Our room was very lavishly decorated and well equipped.  There was a tablet in the room with free wifi and this gave all the information regarding the hotel.  We then went out and travelled by the Emirates cable car over to the 02 for lunch.  This is located right next to The Sunborn and makes a really good trip to take whilst staying here.  We were booked into the restaurant for dinner that evening which was fabulous.  The food was amazing and the views across the water were spectacular.  We had cocktails in the bar served by 2 very friendly bar staff, Marco and Nicola.
This is was complete treat to stay here.  You completely get what you pay for, splendid service, luxurious surroundings and fantastic food.  Breakfast in the morning was probably one of the best I've had in a restaurant.  Lots of variety and very good quality food.  
We were woken early in the morning by what I think was a service trolley but on speaking to Hugo the duty manager he made amends by compensating with complimentary drinks.  This did not spoil our stay here it just showed the great customer service.  
This truly is a 5 star hotel and we will definitely stay again and recommend to friends.",5,2014,12,07
119,excellent,"Had a lovely stay at the Sunborn. Breakfast was gorgeous with so much choice, beautiful smoked salmon, feta, salami and fresh fruit followed by full English. Clean, comfortable accommodation and real comfy bed.  Once checked in a knock at the door was met by a lovely slate of complementary hand made white chocolates. My only very small moan is music in reception and bar was so loud that you couldn't hear the receptionist which spoilt the ambience of the hotel.  Would definitely be going back.",5,2014,12,07
119,A romantic luxury experience,"I had one of the best romantic lunches ever on the Sunborn Yacht last week. It was as if we had booked the entire restaurant as it was quiet, so we experienced the full attention of all the waiters and kitchen crew. There were people downstairs in the bar, but the restaurant was empty at that time. The service was flawless, the food was cooked to perfection as the kitchen were under no pressure at all and we had the best seats in the house to enjoy the amazing views and planes approaching to land at City Airport. The Sunborn is directly under the flight path and also in a perfect location to enjoy a romantic sunset with your best friends. 

What I particularly liked about the Sunborn was that everything just looked like it was cleaned or polished earlier in the day. They seem to maintain a fantastic standard of cleanliness and the cutlery looked like it just came out from a chrome factory and was never used before; it was spotless. There were no fingerprints on the wine glasses or tacky dish washer stains; everything was just well presented. You can expect a quality ""fine-dining"" experience at Sunborn London and I would confidently recommend this venue. (See photos below)",5,2014,12,07
119,A memorable night on the Thames,I would definitely recommend this hotel. It was an amazing experience from the time we checked in to the time we left. Sumpteous surroundings fantastic hotel room with everything that we required. Breakfast was superb nothing to fault at all and the staff couldn't do enough for you. I will definitely return here.,5,2014,12,06
119,Fun experience,"Sunborn was a very pleasant experience. The rooms are ample and luxurious. We held our Christmas in one of the dinner areas and it was very decent. A very nice boat hotel close to Greenwich, but too far from the city centre. Nice for couples and for those that have already visited london a couple of times",4,2014,12,06
119,A great place to stay in London.,"This Hotel recently opened in Royal Victoria Docks near City Airport. This is a small cruise ship permanently docked within 5 miles of downtown London. The staff is great, the décor is top notch. The food is perfect. You feel like you are cruising on the Thames. This is a welcome treat from the typical stuffy London Hotels. There are 2 Tube stations a short distance away, so avoid the taxis. We will return here often.",5,2014,12,05
119,Elegantly Amazing,"I recommend this hotel to everyone, absolutely top class not just because of the style and to the fact your on a yacht - the service is second to none top class service Claudio we ""Thank You"" for such a brilliant services, champagne pouring quality was 100% you made us settle in remarkably well.. Philip thank you for assisting us with the 5th floor, enabling us to have a balcony, much appreciated... Kind Regards F",5,2014,12,04
119,So relaxing,"We flew back into London from visiting the German Christmas markets and we were exhausted.  So we booked this super yacht just for one night before returning home.  Well we didn't get it wrong!  The room was suite size so not only did we have a 6' bed, but sofa, chair etc.  The bed was so comfy that I didn't wake until 1000 hrs - checkout was 12 noon!  Our window looked out over the river towards the O2 arena.  We had a good price for the Sunday night but if something is on in the Excel Arena, it is much more expensive.  The menu is quite expensive but we chose not to eat there.  Unfortunately the lounge area was being arranged for a meeting but we didn't mind as we were happy sitting and relaxing in our room for the evening.  Would definitely stay again if we can get the same price again.  The only negative, we arrived on the ""tube"" and it was not signposted very well so we had to ask to find it!",5,2014,12,04
119,"High quality, impressively spacious and well located accommodation","On arrival hotel is very impressive and rooms are more than ample with a luxurious feel. We did have a couple of issues, necessitating  a change in room, however the general manager was very receptive to our comments and did all he could to make the remainder of our stay enjoyable.
We intend to make a return visit and would encourage others to try this hotel",4,2014,12,03
119,Quality Service at a Quality Hotel!,"I took a chance and booked this recently new hotel for my husband's 50th. Out of all the other hotels in the vicinity of City  Airport, I was glad I booked this one.

From the moment we arrived we were treated with the upmost courtesy, and as I mentioned in advance that the booking was for a special occasion, they upgraded our room to a slightly larger room. 

We only stayed for one night and we had a couple of cocktails in the bar, along with a burger and fries from the bar menu - all tasted great! 

This is an ideal place for a special occasion, and yes the cocktails and food are probably a tad more pricey than a couple of other places nearer the Excel. That said, the service was excellent, the room and hotel had top-quality amenities and all-in-all, we both had a very comfortable stay .

I'd happily stay there again and would recommend this place to anyone!",5,2014,12,03
119,Impressed :),"Came across this hotel by accident whilst searching for somewhere close to the O2 Arena, and really glad I booked it. I had a very reasonable price and didn't tell my husband that the hotel was in fact a yacht, his face was a picture went we walked around the dock and first saw it, it's quite impressive. The place certainly has the wow factor with its impressive lobby, huge chandelier and water view and we were greeted by lovely friendly and helpful staff at the reception desk.
Our room had a water view and was large with a comfortable bed,  lovely soft carpet, seating area, mounted TV, ironing board & laundry service, Lavazza coffee machine although disappointingly no biscuits!!!  and rather than the usual information books and room service menu, this hotel has information tablet from which you could order room service. 
The bathroom seemed to have under floor heating and was stocked with the very gorgeous Molten Brown toiletries :) 
This hotel is literally next door to the Excel Center, and a short walk away from the Emirates cable cars which take you over to the London O2 Arena (please note the cable car service does close about 9pm, so if going to the O2 you'll need a taxi or the tube for the return journey) and is a 12 minute walk away from the DLR. 
I would definitely recommend this hotel, its somewhere different to stay and has the wow factor about it.",4,2014,12,03
119,Great new hotel concept - maybe some teething problems,"We stayed here in early November 2014. Easy to find (although I would suggest you use the DLR 'Excel Centre' stop rather than Royal Victoria as its closer). The room was large and nicely furnished. There were a few slightly odd things like the room safe not working - and the much heralded in-room tablet not having any power in it, so we couldn't use it. The bed was very comfortable and we had a pleasant nights sleep. Although obviously not remotely the fault of the hotel, there was a power cut on the Saturday morning which wasn't perfect for us - but the hotel were friendly and have really worked to make amends so should be commended for their customer service. I would strongly recommend this place as a fun and quirky experience which is so very different to the usual tiny roomed tourist ridden London experience.",4,2014,12,03
119,Really enjoyed our stay,"We stayed at the Sunborn hotel at the weekend for the boxing event we were attending at the nearby Excel London.  The less said about that night however, the better.

We stayed from Friday to Sunday and found both the service and the hotel itself to be excellent.  The whole 5th floor, including our room was immaculate, almost as if it was unused prior to our arrival and it was so secure that on a couple of occasions I couldn't even gain access with the correct key.

Staff were great, very attentive and the bar area was nothing short of spectacular.  Would have helped if they stocked Budweiser and Corona as well. Will definitely return.",5,2014,12,02
119,Much nicer than I thought it would be.,"My girlfriend and I recently stayed here for my mother's 50th birthday and we were very pleasantly surprised by the Sunborn. I thought that the rooms would be very small where as in fact they were extremely roomy, clean and bright. The hotel reception definitely has the wow factor with a huge chandelier hanging in the centre of the room. The staff were excellent even giving us vouchers for half price breakfast as it was my mother's 50th birthday. The only downside is the location as it's a bit out of the way. It does however have a good connection to the DLR. I would definitely recommend this hotel to anybody thinking of staying here.",4,2014,12,02
119,Beautiful,"Really enjoyed our stay on the Sunborn, London. The room was plush and very clean, the view was lovely especially on an evening. Great transport links and choice of restaurants nearby.

I would expect to see complimentary water in an ""executive room"" at the price we paid.
The coffee machine was a special added touch.

There was a great choice at breakfast however service was a little slow.

Overall it was a lovely trip and I would stay again.",5,2014,12,01
119,Literally the best weekend,Me and my partner stayed at the Sunborn from Friday night through to Saturday morning as a birthday surprise for me and I can honestly say (together with all the other stuff he arranged) it was the best weekend of my life.  From the minute I walked in to the reception with its polished wood and brass and crystal chandelier I knew it was going to be somewhere that was a cut well above anywhere we'd stayed before.  The staff were professional but really friendly and the room with its private balcony looking over the Thames was spectacular giving us views of Canary Wharf and the surrounding area which at night was superb. Thank you to Sunborn for a brilliant stay and (as my boyfriend doesn't have his own TripAdvisor section on here for me to post rating so I'll have to tag it on here) thank you to Anthony.  I love you more than you could possibly imagine,5,2014,12,01
119,Floating wonder,"My husband booked this for one night as a birthday treat. Wow! Bright, clean and larger than I thought it would be. Staff were excellent. Nothing too much trouble. Food for breakfast was well presented and well cooked. Only one really really small issue was a socket not working. Not a problem - reported and dealt with immediately. Well worth the visit. Thank you",5,2014,11,30
119,A surprisingly great stay,"We were not sure what to expect, having booked a family room on this new floating hotel. It was good value for a family room and near to Excel for Lego Show so we went for it! Well it looked lovely on arrival and we had a great welcome at reception, the kids were made a real fuss of. The room was a good size, clean and comfortable with everything you would expect from a 4 * hotel. We didn't eat in the restaurant but had bars snacks and they were fine. Slept really well and all peaceful which is amazing considering there was boxing going on at the Excel that night and we expected some repercussions! Breakfast was good and the staff could not have been nicer or more helpful. We will return! Thank you!",5,2014,11,30
119,wonderful two nights on board,"I have just treated my wife to two nights on board this wonderful yacht as a surprise, and what a surprise it was as she is terrified of boats and water, when she saw the yacht I wished I had my camera to capture the look on her face.when I assured her that it would not move ,in fact is was bolted to the docks and could not move if it wanted  to.
The two nights was not long enough as the whole experience was fantastic and we are looking forward to going next year, we normally stay in central London , this was a pleasant change 
The staff were first class  and only to happy to help",5,2014,11,30
119,Amazing Sunborn,"We stayed for a special birthday and had a thoroughly fab time 

The executive room was huge with every amenity coffee maker 
Tablet and Molton brown toiletries 

We booked dinner and that was 
Above and beyond expectations 
Service great 

A lovely venue for a special treat and we will be back 

Breakfast really good with lovely 
Views over the City 

An amazing experience ",5,2014,11,30
119,Simply amazing!,"Me and my boyfriend stayed here because we were seeing Enrique at the O2. The hotel is not far from the O2, you can either get the cable cars a cross the river or the DLR. Both are only 5 mins walk away. The staff were really nice as soon as we stepped into reception someone took our bags to our hotel. You need a key card for everything so no one can get in from the outside! Our room was absolutely lovely, everything you could wish for. We did not eat anything from the hotel because it was a bit pricey but I'm sure it would have been lovely. Lovely view of the river from our room. Free WiFi and there is a tablet in the room which you can order roomservicefrom, check news, travel info and internet. We went out to the O2 and when we came back there was better from the hotel wishing that we had a lovely stay and that they were happy to help. Definitely recommend this hotel to anyone! Best hotel I've stayed at!",5,2014,11,30
119,over night stay,"We stayed here for a wedding anniversary ,this  was everything you could wish for  .Our room which were upgraded for free as an anniversary treat was amazing ,our room was fantastic ,one of the nicest i have stayed in .The views were fabulous .The staff on the Sunborn  were very helpful nothing was to much trouble .Breakfast was delicious and well worth the extra .I wish we could of stayed another night .The Sunborn is easily got to via the DLR only leaving a short 5 min walk to the boat. There are lots of Places to eat close by and ride in the cable car across the river is a must .",5,2014,11,28
119,Unique and amazing experience!,This gorgeous ship offer such a unique and elegant experience in the dockland area of London. Well I did not stay in the guestroom we did have dinner and everything about it was just simply perfect. The service the environment the food was all really outstanding.  I definitely recommend trying it however it is a bit pricey,5,2014,11,27
119,Super service,I experienced a fantastic service -friendly staff always with a smile. Very nice room and a great restuarant. The conference facility was good and the location close to the cable car.I strongly recommend the hotel.,5,2014,11,26
119,What a fantastic surprise,"My daughter booked us both into this awesome hotel. It was one of many surprises that day!
The staff were very attentive. Nothing was too much. The room was out of this world. Never stayed anywhere as stunning before. The beds were comfy, tea and coffee in your room, free, Drinks in fridge, to pay, if required. So much more to say, but would never be enough. Thank you to my daughter Lyanne, for an experience I will never forget. :-)",5,2014,11,25
119,Fantastic stay,"Have just visited the Sumborn for my wife's birthday weekend, the hotel was faultless as were the staff, our 4 year old doughter loved every minute of it and the staff really made her feel special. Would highly recommend this hotel to anyone visiting London.",5,2014,11,24
119,Certainly has the WOW FACTOR!!!,"This hotel is a must visit for anyone looking for a little piece of luxury and of course something a bit different to your run of the mill hotel room. 
The lift takes you to the reception where you are greeted by the very friendly staff. 
We had booked an executive room with a balcony overlooking the water. In the room was a very clean bathroom equipped with Molton Brown toiletries. The bed was a king size and extremely comfortable. A 'tablet' next to the bed was free to use with the wifi. There was also a mini bar and an excellent lavazza coffee machine. The room was very well presented, very clean and decorated to a very high standard. 
Breakfast was offered to us at a discounted price as it was the weekend. We were lucky enough to have a table overlooking the back of the boat with views towards the O2 arena and the Emirates Cable Cars. As previous reviewers have stated, the sausages are delicious. 
We would definitely return to this hotel. We had a lovely stay and recommend it to anyone
Thank you to all staff at Sunborn for a very enjoyable stay.",5,2014,11,24
119,"Great yacht, fantastic crew...","As soon as you board the Sunborn Yacht you realise this is something else. Located conveniently near to the city airport, O2 arena and the financial district, this hotel offers you modern and spacious rooms, good conference facilities, and excellent dining. You are well taken care of from the second you arrive by the remarkable crew. Try it.",5,2014,11,24
119,Best hotel in London,"Waking up to sun rising across the water with a view of London to die for. This is a fabulous idea and hotel. Great views,great food, great rooms. Go stay. It even has conference rooms, an auditorium and a spa!",5,2014,11,24
119,Wonderful experience at the Sunborn,"I would like to thank you for a fantastic experience staying at your wonderful yacht for our Global Conference last week. Quite amazed that you could handle our group of 100+ participants!

The food, the extremely friendly staff, and the fantastic rooms made it an unforgettable experience! On one hand you enjoy the maritime experience, and on the other you have the comfort of a hotel size bed room with large window and a great view.

We will surely be back!

Peter Trampe",5,2014,11,24
119,Unique concept...,Imagine staying in London in a hotel on the water - not looking out onto the Thames but actually living on it. Spacious and clean rooms and good service. Stayed for a business conference and the kitchen managed to serve a very good four course dinner to over 80 of us simultaneously. Quite an achievement and one I wouldn't have expected from a hotel on the water. Highly recommended.,5,2014,11,23
119,I wish it was mine.......,"Dear Sunborn,
We have just had the most wonderful experience for a two day conference, where you make it an unforgettable exeperince. The Yacht offers brilliant opportunities to enjoy large rooms, service employees that go out of their way to look after you, dinner and restaurant offers that matches the best of London dining and last an atmosphere that looks after you from arrival to check-out. I will return soon with my family and other business partners.
Thanks to a brilliant GM, Andreas Stys for being so personally and participate in the activities from start to an end - you can host most conferences with joy in these surroundings.",5,2014,11,21
119,Great place for a conference,Spent two days at a conference on board. It is a great venue. Very nice and spacy rooms with great amenities. Excellent breakfast. Centrally located with quick access to the Financial district. Just a different experience to stay at a yacht. Seen one of the traditional hotels - seen them all. This is something to try.,4,2014,11,21
119,Expensive experience,"The yacht is near the Excel centre and the O2 arena. There is also the ski gondolas nearby for crossing the river.
A taxi drive into the city takes 25 minutes (we used an Uber car and it was £38 to the West End). 
The dining room/restaurant menu was very expensive and quite limited. If we were staying for more than 1 night we wouldn't have eaten there again. Breakfast was good value at £10 per person (weekend rate) normally £19.99 which we wouldn't have paid as it was very basic. It was very busy and there was a big queue of people waiting for a 2nd dining area to be prepared. I've had more choice at travel Inns. The staff on reception were very helpful
Especially letting us store our bags until check in (3pm) and accommodating our request for a river view room. (As opposed to dock side view which is just a paved plaza area). 
The room was lovely, just like a normal hotel. With a little balcony area. The bathroom was like what you get in a caravan? I guess it has to be like that ? Very nice Molten & Brown miniatures in the shower area. 
The location is good for docklands area of London but not if you are doing lots of travelling to the centre of London.",3,2014,11,20
119,Unbelievable!!,"Checked in about 2 hours ago. Given a fantastic river side room. Kingsize bed, plush carpets Molton Brown toiletries, LavAzza coffee machine, bathrobes and slippers, air con, wifi, 3d tv and a Sony tablet to book room service and so much more! Love it!  Views of the river, the O2, the Emirates airline, and the city. Will definately be back",5,2014,11,20
119,Sunday night stay,"We stayed the night at this hotel. The room, although classic, was superb.  Lovely shower & toiletries. It was well decorated, spotlessly clean  & a good size. The bed was very comfortable. We had bar snacks instead of a meal as we had eaten a full lunch. My only complaint was that the bar menu on the tablet in the room was different to the one in the bar. The bar menu was more restricted. I was looking forward to having prawns but they were not on the menu. This was disappointing. The food we had was good. Breakfast was excellent. Check in & out was speedy. Staff were helpful.",5,2014,11,20
119,could of been better,"visited the Sunborn on Saturday 15th November as a Birthday treat. Greeted by very friendly reception staff, our room was not ready as we were earlier than expected which wasn't too much of a problem for us. The room was very nice and accommodating with a river view. Bar area was nice and the cocktails were also very good. However this is where it became disappointing. Breakfast was a shambles. We were left standing at the desk for at least 5 minutes before anyone came to attend. When we were eventually approached we then waited another 5 minutes for the table to be cleaned. We was offered tea and then they totally forgot to bring the tea over to us. self service with food running out and having to wait for a top up. Breakfast was an unpleasant experience and I feel this put a bit of a disappointment on my Birthday treat. £40 for breakfast was not worth it and to put a service charge on top is a bit of a joke really.",3,2014,11,19
119,Highly recommended,"We recently had our first stay at the Sunborn, staying for two nights, and it was a thoroughly enjoyable break. The cabin style rooms were well sized and well equipped, with great views over the lovely waters of the dock. The food was excellent, as were the staff, with friendly greetings at all times of the day, whatever their role. It also served as a very convenient base to easily access the sights and sounds of London.",5,2014,11,17
119,Sunborn  London Awesome,"Stayed here as visiting the O2 staff are 1st class made to feel very welcome, check in quick and easy. Drinks are around £8 with mixer but they are doubles. Executive King Room very spacious and well presented.

Bar food excellent and breakfast well worth it, pay in advance £10 east access over to the O2 by cable car, trains also right on the doorstep.

Well worth the money will be staying again.

Excellent ship, staff 1st class, room excellent, food excellent.",5,2014,11,16
119,Wonderful Weekend Retreat,"I stumbled upon Sunborn when looking for a London Hotel to stay at, for my daughters 21st birthday celebrations. This stood out, not because of the fact its a ship, but because of the reviews it had received to date. 

The location of Sunborn, outside the Excel in London's Docklands makes it accessible by DLR, and the Emirates Airline (cable car) to the O2 is literally 200 metres away.

The rooms are spacious, well equipped, and comfortable. We had not booked breakfast but were offered this at a reduced rate when we checked in - £10 as opposed to £19 per person. The breakfast selection was plentiful. We did not use the restaurant at other times, but we did have drinks in the bar, overlooking the dock and lights of the O2 and Canary Wharf. 

We would definitely return and recommend to others wanting a London break with a difference.",5,2014,11,14
119,Novel and nice,Sunborn London is a super yacht moored out ExCel in London that operates as a hotel. I had a cabin with an outdoor balcony and it was lovely to be able to look out over the water. The views of Canary Wharf from the dining room are pretty special too. The rooms are spacious and the entire hotel combines the glamour of cruising with the convenience of a static hotel. The onboard spa has just opened too. The massage and facial combo is worth a splurge.,5,2014,11,13
119,Fabulous place to stay!,"Unfortunately for us because of the lateness of our check in (due to being at a concert in the O2)
we didn't have enough time to fully explore this beautiful hotel. However what we did see was wonderful. The reception staff were charming and fun, very interested in us and our needs. The room was amazing and had everything we wanted and more. Breakfast was a bit expensive as it was a set price and we only really wanted fruit, but if you had a bigger appetite there was a great deal to choose from. I will definitely return and take my husband next time. Loved it!!!",5,2014,11,13
119,Brilliant Concierge!,"Well, this floating hotel has that ""something different"" factor.  We were going to a concert at the O2 Indigo and it was a special birthday celebration for my husband, so this fitted the bill!  We were allocated a river view and an upgrade . The Sunborne looks fantastic and has views to match, especially at night.  I guess it has that cruise ship glamour style.  Not necessarily minimally chic, but nevertheless, a great place to stay and relax with great customer service.  I regret we did not ask the name of the excellent concierge who was on duty yesterday and today, because he was the epitome of what good customer service is all about.  So charming, so helpful and even remembered us when we bumped into him at the DLR station.  Made us feel special and so we would recommend the Sunborne as long as they continue to employ staff of this calibre.  Dinner was good, but not exceptional.  But in the end did not want to leave!",4,2014,11,12
119,A very pleasant experience,"I had the pleasure of staying on the Sunborn for two days this week whilst I was down in London on business. I was given a room with a river view and a balcony, and the room was spacious. The decor within the whole hotel was very beautiful, especially the spiral staircase in reception.

The bed was the most comfortable bed I've ever slept in. As soon as I lay my head on the pillow, I was out like a light. The shower room was clean and bright. The complimentary Molton Brown amenities were a very nice touch. I used the in-room tablet to go through the facilites on the hotel, and it felt a very modern experience.

I only ate at breakfast time in the restaurant due to work commitments, and the breakfast spread was extensive and extremely tasty. The sausages in particularly were bursting with flavour. The staff were all friendly and helpful, particularly the guys who were on reception late on Sunday evening when I checked in.

I would fully recommend staying on Sunborn London, it has everything you could ask for, and more!",5,2014,11,12
119,Unique and .... almost perfect,"Impressive and unique place to stay in London and easy access to the central city attractions via the DLR but you are away from the hustle and bustle.  We stayed in a classic room which had a large porthole, we asked on arrival if it was possible to have one of the rooms with a river view and were fortunate to get one.  The room was lovely, spacious, wood flooring, comfy bed and although the bathroom (shower room more accurate) was a little small it had a decent size shower cubicle.  

The only down side was that we had been expecting a coffee maker and bathrobes in the room and found neither on arrival... In fact no coffee of any description, just tea and a kettle.  We queried this and the staff rectified the situation on both counts, although I was given the excuse by the person who brought the coffee maker and coffee into us that our room was one of a small number at the 'sharp end' of the boat where, due to the tapering shape of the room there wasn't room for a coffee maker.  If that was the case why weren't we supplied with instant coffee sachets to go with the kettle?  And she managed to find a convenient place for the coffee maker anyway!  The room is more than big enough!  She was very helpful though, demonstrating how to use the coffee maker without being prompted. In fact all the staff throughout the boat were very friendly and welcoming.

Eating lunch outside on the deck on a miraculously warm October day was a bonus!  The view is great during the day but even better at night with Canary Wharf lighting up the background.  Food and drink prices aren't cheap but only what you'd expect in London...and there's a Tesco Express a few minutes walk away.   Breakfast was excellent and was reasonably priced (special weekend rate £10).  

All in all I would highly recommend if you're looking to stay somewhere quiet and a little bit special.",5,2014,11,11
119,Weekend on the water,"We had a couple of nights aboard the Sunborn recently and I have to say she is amazing inside as well as out. The recetion area and spiral staircase is beautiful, and the suite we had was gorgeous with a view over the water and the O2 to our right. 
It was easy to find and get to as well being right outside the Excel in London. Quite interesting watching planes land and take off from London City Airport as well.
Room was superb with fixtures and fittings easily on a par with the best we have visited. Only downside was the breakfast when a lot of people were in at once they ran out of a few things and we had towait a while but the food was fine other than that. Bar prices dear but to be expected in London and slightly cheaper than the Ritz...",4,2014,11,11
119,Recent stay at Sunborn,"Arrived at sunborn for rememberance day weekend with partner. Given room facing a wall rather than the Thames and receptionist claimed hotel was fuy booked, rubbis, hotel was near enough empty. Second issue, eletric went out saturday morning but as we were going to see a show and needed to start our day I ended up walking around London with wet hair, reception staff again, couldnt of cared less. Last issue, in a rush to see another show as train was delayed, asked reception staff for auickest transport advice, would of got more sense if I spoke to the wall. Most useless group of females I've ever come across, more like a mothers meeting than a service. Will definetly not be staying again. Also location of hotel is conpletely random and nothing around it at all. Personal advice, if your adament on staying in that particular location, stay in the ibis next door.",2,2014,11,11
119,Heaven,"what can I say other than WOW what a wonderful hotel. Staff very friendly and helpful. Immaculately clean throughout and the room was pure luxury.  We stayed for two nights and was a little worried that it may be a little out the way from central London but the DLR is on the doorstep and very frequent trains so it wasn't a problem.  I can't recommend  enough.  We had breakfast both mornings, Buffett style  was very nice indeed.",5,2014,11,11
119,Disappointing,"I booked this hotel after reading positive reviews on Trip Advisor and we were celebrating my husbands 40th Birthday, like one of the previous reviews we had a power cut on board whilst my daughter was in the shower and the hotel was plunged into darkness. No explanations or apologies from reception staff and they really had a could not care less attitude. My husband and I had to endure horrendously cold showers whilst trying to prop the door open as I had booked a special event in London to go to. This hotel is not cheap but you do not receive the service that goes alongside the price tag.  I have stayed at cheaper hotels and received a far better service than the Sunborn and I will not be returning to this hotel anytime soon.  There are better and cheaper places with a better service than this hotel.",2,2014,11,10
119,Mixed Feelings,"The staff were very welcoming and their continued good service was wonderful. Breakfast and Dinner was excellent. Heaven on the taste buds. It was wonderful to relax in the evening looking out at the fantastic London Skyline. 

As a party of 3 we needed to use the sofa bed which resulted in a sleepless night and a bad back. This was rectified with a thin mattress for the rest of our stay but still not 5 Star comfort. We had to on 2 occasions ask for the milk and tea to be replenished in the room. There was no extractor fan in the bathroom resulting in a sauna.",4,2014,11,10
119,Perfect location for Excel visitors,"This unique hotel is perfect base for all Excel Exhibition Area visitors, only few steps from the yacht. Hotel offers several types of the rooms, be sure you receive requested type of the room. In my conformation there was a coffe machine included, but in reality there was no in the room.
The biggest adventage of this property is location - close to Emirates cable car or Excel venue.",4,2014,11,10
119,Customer care lacking,"We stayed on the Sunborn London for 2 nights in early November. It is a lovely 'ship' and the ambience makes you feel very exclusive.  It is quite a long journey to central London though via DLR and tube - plan for about an hour each way. 

The room we were given was on the lowest deck just above the waterline. Facing the dock wall was not exactly the most interesting of views. I guess this may be what you get when you book a discounted rate through Expedia.  Still, the room itself was huge and well appointed with quality furnishings and lovely big bed although there was no hotel directory in the room so there was no way to learn what was on board.

We ate at the restaurant the first night which was very pleasant. Pricey but that's to be expected.

The hotel is very peaceful at night although we did have some pump system kick in at odd hours which vibrated through the cabin. This only lasted a minute or so but it was quite noticeable in our lower deck cabin. 

There is a spa but our room key didn't provide access to the spa level (you need your room key to get anywhere on board). So we were not able to see what treatments the spa offered. With nothing in the room to advertise the spa either it looks like Sunborn want to keep it a secret.

The biggest let down though occurred the first morning when the ship was plunged into darkness due to a power cut. No emergency lighting and certainly no back up generators. This was 9.20am. It meant getting showered and dressed in a pitch black bathroom trying to prop open the door with my suitcase to get some light to see. The ship  gets its power from the nearby ExCel Centre which was the cause of the problem. The ship was without power for nearly 7 hours with all corridors in blackness, lifts not working and no hot water. There was no written apology from the management for the inconvenience - I know it was not their fault but I can't believe that the ship doesn't have a back up generator. There was no offer of compensation - even a complimentary drink in the bar would have been something. It spoilt our leisurely get up on Saturday morning. It seems that the hotel has not worked out what to do in this situation and its customer care is very much lacking. 

The electricity problem soured our taste of luxury and sadly we won't return.",3,2014,11,09
119,Two days in London,"A great London escape with easy access to London on the DLR and great place to stay if attending O2 or Excel convention centre.

Excellent Attentive friendly staff. Fantastic room, shower, and a great quiet dark nights sleep in London. 

A unique experience and will definitely return. I believe children stay free!",5,2014,11,09
119,Terrible service,"We arrived to a powercut. Fair enough as it wasnt their fault. We were offered a complimentary drink at the bar because of this. After waiting in line while others were served gin and tonics and vodka and cokes we were told it was beer or wine only as there was no ice left. I said i would have my drink without ice but was told it was beer or wine only anyway. When eventually we could check in we overheard yhe couple next to us being offered complimentary breakfast for their inconvenience, but that wasnt available for us. When we did go for breakfast we ssked for a window seat but were told no as it was a table for four and there were two of us, then the couple behind us were shown to the table for four despite there being another table for two available. The photos of the room type we chose showed balconies but when we arrived we were told those room types didnt have balconies, the photos were of a different room type - we had a non opening porthole. We did ring beforehand to check but the person we spoke to didnt speak very good english and couldnt understand. And there were no robes in the room despite the website stating there was. And the coffee at breakfast was cold and there were no pastries left. Very inconsistent service. Better service at a travelodge.",3,2014,11,09
119,Well worth it ,"We stayed here when going to a concert at the O2. The stay was amazing and we'll worth the money. However  a couple of constructive points. Book a room and specify a river view. 
Avoid the on board bar. Don't mind paying higher prices for the  drinks, but don't like a £1.60 surcharge for the honour of walking  to the  bar to collect  them.  Go to the tesco  express and take it to your room. 
Room great, bathroom good, bed comfortable. 
Breakfast. . Food quality amazing. 100% quality ingredients and perfectly cooked.
Main problem staff. Pleasant, but we  thought we were in a scene from fawlty towers. We have  never seen such a disorganised breakfast service.  Something to work on. 
Be aware the O2 is not easy to  reach from here.  Cable car is good, but stops at 9pm. Tube back difficult.  Taxi back £25.00.
In summary we would stay  here  again .",4,2014,11,08
119,Night on a super yacht,"We recently spent the night on the Sunborn. Intriguing is perhaps the best description. It's in a great location for Excel and pretty good for the O2 which is across the river. We went in to London for the evening which is easy enough via the DLR. Parking in the excel car park is reasonable and handy.

We were ""upgraded"" to a room with a balcony which was nice but we didn't get a river view which meant we looked out onto the Excel which was fine but the other side of the boat would be nicer.

The hotel was ok. Not as up market as it claims but the room was nice enough with plenty of space and comfy big bed. The bathroom wasn't great, a bit small but functional. 

We didn't spend a lot of time in the hotel but we had a drink on the deck which was ok if rather expensive and not the nicest of wines. When we asked the barman for a cocktail menu he told us they had run out, which amused us a little. Breakfast wasn't included in our booking but was offered to us at an extortionate rate so we didn't bother.

Overall I would say it was different, but not as different as you think it's going to be. A nice enough place to stay for 1 night but I doubt we will go back.",4,2014,11,08
119,Very memorable stay - EXCELLENT!!,"Firstly the location was excellent. Not only is it convenient for people visiting the london excel it was great for a leisure stay as it is a few minutes walk from Custom House DLR Station. The Emirates cable cars are also about 5 minutes walk down the road which gives easy access to the O2 Arena.
The yacht was stunning to look at and the reception area is amazing once you enter. The staff are friendly and very welcoming no complaints there whatsoever. The room was only a standard room but it was a traditional varnished wood decor that you would expect on a superyacht but still breathtaking and well maintained by the staff. The bar in the evening is perfect for a relaxing few drinks before going out or even after going out as it is open until 1am. The deck outside faces canary wharf and the O2 which is a stunning view of the skyline 10/10.
There is so much to say about this hotel, however you dont appreciate it until you go and experience it for yourself. Well done Sunborn. We will surely be returning soon.",5,2014,11,08
119,"unique,luxurious and a hotel with a difference","i booked this hotel reading the reviews left on trip advisor and i was not disappointed, the location was ideal as that it was only a short drive from central london without the riddiculous parking costs and congestion charge, i managed to park in the excel car park which is only a 5 minutes walk if that to the hotel. The room also had a tablet to use and the room was spacious and the view of the river was fantastic, for people looking to book i suggest requesting the view of the river rather than staring at the excel venue, also pay the little extra and upgrade to a better room , i stayed at a junior suite and enjoyed the balcony view, would i visit sunburn again..most definitely, could not complain about my stay and staff were very helpful...",4,2014,11,07
119,"Unique, luxurious and great service","I recently stayed at the Sunborn Hotel as it was only slightly more expensive than a central London Premier Inn, and I'm so glad I did. It's right next to Excel and the Custom House DLR stop. A couple of pubs nearby, although I didn't use them. 

It's a beautiful vessel. Sparkling crystal and brass everywhere. You feel like you're off on a cruise! The service on the front desk is impeccable and every single member of staff I encountered during my visit acknowledged me with a cheery hello (ever the chap up a ladder changing a light bulb). 

I booked an executive king room with a balcony and honestly, I was VERY tempted to cancel my evening plans just so I could stay in my room all night! The room was spotlessly clean, the carpet was fluffy, the enormous mirrors were polished, the bed was to die for.The coffee machine and Molton Brown toiletries were little details that made this whole place feel very special indeed. 

Noise-wise I could have been the only person in the hotel. I didn't hear any movement from the rooms above and to the side of me, but it's a shame that the boat is directly under the flight path of London City Airport. The flights don't run late into the night, but they do start up again at about 7am and despite the double glazing, it can get pretty loud. This is my ONLY complaint. 

Travel-wise it's about 10 mins to Bank, and I made it to Hampstead in 35 mins. 

This is definitely my new go-to hotel when I'm visiting London.",5,2014,11,06
119,hotel with a difference,"We chose to stay at the Sunborn Yacht hotel for a change to the traditional hotels, also because of visits to the excel centre, the location for the excel or the O2 is fabulous right on the door step. The hotel is really unique it offers style and elegance and something a little different. Rooms are beautiful very spacious. The restaurant was a little expensive however the food was absolutely amazing, service excellent and all the staff were extremely helpful nothing was too much trouble. Breakfast on the ship very relaxed and a perfect way to start the day. Worth every penny.",5,2014,11,06
119,Gorgeously romantic,"I loved our 2 night stay in this hotel. Stunning view of the river from our balcony. The staff were brilliant! We had some delicious chocolate truffles and a congratulatory note waiting for us in our room for our anniversary, a lovely touch. Each room has a Sony tablet, you can use it for room service and order directly from the tablet. There's a telephone too if you're a technophobe! The food is delicious and fresh. And the room! Oh the room is just gorgeous, just take a look at some of the pictures. The decor in the hotel is gorgeous too. I'd definitely recommend this place, you won't want to leave the room once you're inside!",5,2014,11,06
119,Beautiful and different. Great location.,"We recently stayed at the sunborn for our first wedding anniversary. We loved everything about it, it's so very different but at the same time lovely. The location is great and is very easy to get in to London via the DLR. The staff at the hotel were very pleasant and made us feel very welcome. They upgraded us as well with it being out anniversary. We really would recommend the sunborn to anyone and we for sure will be returning. ",5,2014,11,05
119,a different hotel for sure,"We really enjoyed our two nights on the sunborn,it was unique.The staff were excellent and the room much larger then you would expect.We would have given it an excellent rating instead of very good as we felt the breakfast should have been served fresh and not buffet style.",4,2014,11,05
119,"Excellent hotel, but it is a hotel","The Sunborn is just as it appears. The hotel is excellent and modern, possibly one of the best Ive stayed in in the UK and compares to 5* in Dubai and Singapore I've stayed in. However, while it does have a 'wow factor' from the outside, once on board, it is just a hotel until you look out a porthole. 
The location is not brilliant unless you are at ExCel or the O2 but the DLR is only 5 min walk away so if you get a good deal, its definitely worth it. Otherwise, stick with city hotels (though you may not get the size of room). This is better than hotels I've stayed at in Canary Wharf though. Large room, nice bathroom and I got the water side room I requested.
Staff were very friendly and helpful, no issues as others have mentioned. Didn't have breakfast (£20 extra) - much prefer a greasy spoon! Would return if there was a good offer on again. ",4,2014,11,04
119,Exceptionally different!!,"Never been on a cruise; however our friends we stayed with here last weekend have on numerous occasions. This was our choice; imagine the pressure of getting this right on a fixed berth 'Super Yacht'? WOW though!!; the impact when you walk around the corner in front of the Excel; through the ramp to the lifts to gain entrance. Fantastic reception and greetings from the staff at check-in. We were advised of their weekend breakfast special of £10pp which was readily taken up & very good.
Rooms spacious & luxurious, wood everywhere!; a tablet to view menus, facilities and internet; however you need to get over the need for steel doors and firebreak doors which is different to a hotel on land. Shower room smaller than a traditional hotel (people moan about this but it is at the end of the day a 'ship'!!) but good shower & Molten Brown toiletries.
The views of O2, Emirates cable car & Canary Wharf excellent as are connections via DLR to Jubilee line.
Our seagoing friends thought it was fantastic.
A superb memorable break which I booked well in advance for a great price.
this will however get dearer as & when it gets more publicity.
Loved it. Will hopefully go again.",5,2014,11,03
119,Miss Elaine Stuart,"We had a fab time booked in on 31/10/14 our room was ready earlier than we expected great smiles with a lovely welcome. Booked in a lovely spacious cabin
We had a quick drink and decided to be tourists for the next two days, the staff wished my partner a happy birthday and a lovely letter saying so, with a voucher for drinks. (A really nice touch) A lovely guy tall dark haired helped me with the big bus tours finding out information and prices, he was more than helpful. On checking out they let us leave our bags until we were ready to go home. A great experience 
I wish they did a loyalty card, I will defiantly go back 10/10",5,2014,11,03
119,Well worth a stay,Having travelled to London on many occasions we thought we would try a different experience and it was well worth it.  It was a little difficult to locate as our driver did not have a clue how to find it but we eventually made it and were pleasantly surprised at the standard of accommodation.  We were a little disappointed that we could not find any information on the background of the vessel but we will be following this up for an Australian leisure mag article - keep your eyes out for it.,4,2014,11,03
119,"Different, but not so different","Yes. Surprisingly large boat, permanently docked. Good restaurant (dinner and breakfast). Rooms OK. Small bar with good cocktails, and outside terrace overlooking Canary Wharf. Other than restaurant and bar very little in the way of facilities. Comfortable and enjoyable.",4,2014,11,02
119,Wow....Fantastic!,"My husband booked this for my birthday and boy what a lovely time we had. The room was lovely and the customer service exceptional. We stayed for one night with easy access into city and west end. We booked for a dinner and breakfast package and were not disappointed.
The bedroom we had was river facing (recommended) with in room tablet with access to WiFi, Internet, hotel info and services. We were also able to see the fireworks for bonfire night (over the apartments at Blackheath Common). The view of the lit up cable cars and O2 was nice too.
We will definitely be returning to stay here again! Our compliments to the staff at Sunborn London!",5,2014,11,02
119,Hotel with a difference!,"Myself, girlfriend and her two teenage kids have just spent the last two nights on the Sunborn! The service was excellent, and the two rooms we had were large, by London standards, and very clean. The whole boat was spotless in fact!

The kids loved the idea of staying on a boat in the middle of London! With the DLR and Emirates Air Line just a short walk away its pretty easy to get places even though its not very central. 

Unfortunately, the only down side was the extortionate drink prices in the bar! I know London prices are high anyway, but a JD and coke for over £10 seemed excessive to me, especially seeing as the room prices were so reasonable! 

I would still recommend the hotel, and I may even return myself!",4,2014,10,31
119,Amazing Yacht hotel in London with 5*comfort,"The Sunborn was amazing to stay at. Upon arrival my partner and I were welcomed by friendly and polite staff. They were very helpful and quick with checking in. Our room was magnificent. The bed was spacious with a lovely living area. The layout was appropriate for us and the balcony was amazing. It gave us a lovely view. 

What was most shocking, it was silent at night. I did not hear anything and had the best sleep ever. I stay in Hotels 2-3 times a week and even hotels such as the Waldorf have let me down with noise problems. The sunborn was peaceful and tranquil and I felt like I was nowhere near London City.

To wake up and easily travel for my business flight to London City Airport allowed me to enjoy sleeping in a little longer in the comfort of Sunborn London. 

A must and I will definitely recommend it to fellow friends and businesses to stay there again!",5,2014,10,31
119,WOW!,"This is the way to spend a night in London on this beautiful boat....the location is great very close to O2 and train station lots of restaurants for a bite to eat, the Sunborn itself is spotlessly clean the rooms are beautiful and the service is brilliant with happy helpful staff. Romea on the reception desk was brilliant and very helpful, we stayed in a river view room where you could see the O2, the bed was very comfy, and the bathroom had a good shower in it which was also very clean, large Smart TV and a tablet for internet,  i would highly recommend this hotel to all my friends and family. Great stay thank you to Sunborn and all the staff would love to come back!

119,hidden gem,"We stayed for one night and got a kingsize double room for £140, usually £260. The boat was as lovely as it looks and the service was top class. Our rooms was large, considering it was one of the cheaper room. The yatch had only officially been open 3 mths, so everything was in mint condition and very clean. The view from the sun lounge at the stern was very good, so good that we had 3 large glasses of wine watching the sunset behind the o2 and cable cars. I did ask if you can just come and drink on board and indeed you can, making this a real hidden gem in London as there were only one other couple enjoying the view. We booked in about 13.30 and our room was ready, requested as per previous tips the river side. We got the Thames clipper from London bridge to the 02(north greenwich) which was £6.80 (£12.00 rtn), then the emirates cable car(well worth the £3.30) to the royal victoria dock. You can see the yatch below you from the cable car. We ventured back into London when it was dark, thus glad we had booked the rtns. The cable car at night was amazing, seeing all the lights etc. The service was first class.",5,2014,10,29
119,Fabulous london break,"I have just returned from a 2 night break in London and had a wonderful stay at the sunborn. 
Hotel was easy to find and a short pleasant walk from Prince Albert DLR station. If you are looking for a relaxing break the Sunborn gives you a 5 star service at an affordable price. 

Check in was swift and easy and the reception staff were welcoming, friendly and warm. They had upgraded our stay as it was for a birthday present. 

The room was immaculate, clean and spacious which I found surprising given it was a yacht. We had a room overlooking the dock giving us a stunning view of the O2 and Canary Wharf. The bed was dressed with towel swans and fresh rose petals. Use of a sony tablet was a added luxury and the tea coffee facilities were plentiful. I was worried of being on the flight path to London City airport but this failed to cause a problem as the flights stopped in the evening and the sound proof windows and doors blocked out the noise. The rooms had air conditioning and a very comfortable bed. The large shower provided a powerful water supply. 

Having worked in the hotel industry for many years I am always aware of the hidden issues and could not find any fault with the room. 

Breakfast was included and offered a wonderful cooked breakfast. The herbed tomatoes and mushrooms were amazing. The continental selection and pastries where delicious too and we had enough to fill us for the day ahead. The restaurant setting offered perfectly laid tables and staff were very attentive and unobtrusive. 

We were lucky enough to have beautiful clear warm weather for the end of October which allowed us to enjoy a drink on the sun deck. My partner really fancied an ice tea and even though it was not listed on the menu the bar man offered to make him one. 

Overall, I can not stress enough how professional yet warm and friendly the staff were. Everyone made you feel very important and welcomed you wherever you were. The staff are a wonderful asset to the Sunborn. 

I would defiantly recommended this hotel, it was lovely to escape the hustle and bustle of the city centre and the air felt fresh and clean after a day walking and sight seeing. Please do not be put off by the location, I will definitely return for another city break. I would much rather stay here than a city centre hotel. 

Thank you sunborn for a fabulous break.",5,2014,10,28
119,Great stay,"Spacious rooms and very friendly and attentive staff.  Very easy to get into Central London.  The comfiest bed ever!!   
We received an upgrade to a room with a balcony and view of the river. Would definitely stay here again.",5,2014,10,28
119,Nice hotel,"This was a great find, easy to get to on the docklands light rail. Only a few minutes walk to the hotel. Nice easy lift up to reception, then easy check in. Room was a good. Size with nice fittings. Breakfast was nice but be careful what they charge you, they tried to charge us the wrong amount. Overall a good stay with good staff",4,2014,10,28
119,Oh how the other half live.,"Wonderful, luxurious, excellent service, exquisite food, beautiful views ... and we even had great weather.  Highly recommended for a real treat.  Do have lunch or dinner too, you have views of Docklands, City Airport, O2 etc and the dining experience is lovely and although the prices are a little cheeky for my bank account, the food was exceptional - really worth splashing out to to treat yourself and those you love!  I would definitely stay here again, it was a really exciting experience.  Loved it!!",5,2014,10,28
119,Amazing 80th Birthday Party on the Sunborn London,"We hired the Restaurant, Sun Deck Lounge, a Suite and 12 additional rooms for my Mum's 80th birthday party and 130 guests which took place on Saturday 18th October. 

From the planning by the wonderful Ela (Elzbieta Nowacka) Events Manager to the execution of the party I cannot fault the staff in any way they were very attentive, extremely professional, accommodating, helpful and a pleasure to work with as our experience on the Sunborn London was fantastic.

The attention to detail, the communication throughout and keeping us informed I cannot fault the Sunborn London as they provided a service second to none and I would definitely recommend them to anyone thinking of holding an event there as you can sit back and let them do the organising for you and you won't be disappointed 5 out of 5 from me.

The Sunborn London is a luxurious experience and the staff definitely compliment this as make you feel special, always at hand to help, they made our guests feel very special accommodated all of their needs.

The Suite and the rooms on board the Sunborn London are very well equipped and are like home away from home with that special magical twist as you felt you were on a luxury cruise liner cabin very comfortable and modern. The Suite which my mother enjoyed came equipped with a private sundeck overlooking the city and Millennium Dome, Jacuzzi and Sauna definitely fit for a queen and those celebrating something special, We also found the Royal Victoria Docks was easily accessible and very close to City Airport, Central London and DLR. 

We would like to thank all the staff at Sunborn London who contributed to making my mum's birthday party a massive success and for going that extra mile, including the private room for the family breakfast, we really appreciate all that was done. We held her 70th birthday party on the previous Sunborn London which was amazing and one of the reasons we wanted to relive it as their customer service is impeccable. 

From Caroline Fagbemi and Family (Mum's 80th Birthday Party)",5,2014,10,28
119,Stay here for something different,We stayed here for a short break to London and the boat/hotel is excellent. You can park in the excel centre or nearby multi-storey. The boat is-about 30 minutes from central London by DLR and tube. The staff are very attentive and nothing is to much trouble. The rooms are very clean and warm with tea and coffee making but no biscuits. Large powerful shower in the compact bathroom.   ,5,2014,10,27
119,Perfect,The location was perfect for us as our children were attending Comic con at Excel which was opposite the Sunborn. The Yacht was very impressive. The breakfast was really good and the rooms very spacious. We were extremely lucky as on the second night we had to move rooms anyway as the original family room wasn't available for two nights and we were upgraded to a suite. It was amazing. What impressed us the most though was the staff. Every member of staff could not have been more helpful.  I cannot fault the Sunborn - I would definitely recommend it. I am looking forward to the Barcelona yacht becoming available in a couple of years.,5,2014,10,27
119,Fab-u-Lous,What a luxurious place to stay   For my partners birthday we took a night here after eating at China Town.  We were welcomed by knowledgeable and friendly staff - which didn't surprise me after the two telephone calls I had had with them prior to staying.  We were up graded to a room with a balcony and it was luxurious and lovely - the room was very large with every facility you could want. I don't think anyone could complain about the rooms. The linen was beautifully white and crisp and clean and the bed comfortable. My only complaint was the pillows were hard and as I have arthritis in my neck I didn't sleep too well but hey the breakfast was absolutely brilliant and we were lucky enough to get a table by the window looking out at the river. There was everything for breakfast you could want and the service excellent. Definitely a place to stay if you want to be pampered for an evening.,5,2014,10,26
119,Absolutely loved it!!!,"We stayed here for 2 nights over a weekend and it was a fabulous experience. A yacht! It is very easy to get to and doesn't take long to get you back into London (DLR takes you right to the Tower of London so great for tourists!).It is also right next to the Emirates cable cars. The place was immaculate. We had a standard room on the first floor and we were delighted with it. Comfy bed and lovely toiletries. Staff are very friendly and helpful. Unfortunately, we didn't make use of the restaurant and bar facilities as we had plans elsewhere for our time in London but the food looked delicious and there was a great range. We did eat breakfast there one of the mornings though and it was wonderful- a great variety. Would definitely recommend this place for a stay - worth the price. Treat yourself to a bit of luxury!!",5,2014,10,26
119,brilliant location for Excel Conference Centre,"We only stayed for 1 night but wished it would of been longer. We stayed in the classic room which is not the top of the range, but was still very large. It had a large porthole shaped window. A very large comfortable bedroom, coffee machine with  a variety of coffee pods. In room save complimentary. Soundproofing was excellent we didn't hear a thing from either outside or the adjacent rooms. Breakfast was good with a variety of food offered. Lovely views of the O2 and the river from the boat. Staff very helpful and friendly. Excel next door the boat. Took longer to walk the length of the conference centre than it did to walk from the boat to the conference centre. Less than 10 minute walk to the Emirates cable car that takes you across the river to the O2 arena area. Very enjoyable stay.",5,2014,10,25
119,luxury,"A one night stay on a luxury yacht for my wifes birthday. On check in we were given an upgrade to a river view room with a balcony. All staff very helpful in particular Claudio who immediately took our bags from us until we'd checked in then carried them to our room. He explained all the facilities and offered help with finding somewhere to eat if we weren't dining on board. Which we sadly didn't take up  . Avoid bollywood grill. 
Check menu in boat lift as the one on the room tablet was not up to date, had it been, we would have eaten on board. Bargain price for room only £119 from Booking .com",5,2014,10,25
119,Amazing luxurious stay,"Well, where to start. I booked a room here as a surprise for my partners birthday and I must say I was not disappointed. When you first see the yacht it looks spectacular, a real show stopper. My partner was amazed when I said ""This is where we're sleeping tonight!"". Upon arrival we were greeted warmly by an efficient, professional and welcoming team of staff. As we checked in we were lucky enough to be upgraded as I mentioned that it was a special occasion when I booked. When we got to our room, my partner had a handwritten letter from the hotel owner wishing him a happy birthday and some of the most delicious complimentary chocolates on a beautiful slate plate. We were in a room on the second floor, room 2020 I think. It was huge with an enormous bed, fabulous view of the river, spacious bathroom, lovely tv, a tablet to use as we wished and a lovely coffee machine. We both had one of the best nights sleep we've ever had! The yacht itself is moored very well and I can say this as I suffer with seasickness and was not affected at all during our stay. We had a lovely drink in the evening at the Sundown Bar (Not too pricey, £10 for a glass of wine and pint of cider) before heading out into central London for dinner. One piece of advice, if you are travelling by tube DO NOT STOP AT PRINCE REGENT! Go to custom house, Prince Regent makes it very difficult to get to the yacht as we found out. Anyway what can I say, fabulous stay, fabulous staff, fabulous, fabulous, fabulous! We will be recommending to everyone and definitely staying again!",5,2014,10,25
119,"Peaceful, comfortable and perfectly located for the O2","Never in my life have I stayed somewhere that looks exactly the same as the promotional pics - amazing!  The room was spacious, light (porthole level) and very comfortable.  It was also incredibly peaceful - bearing in mind the location is right under the London City flight path.
The staff are super professional and we barely saw anyone while we were there (this could be a bit disappointing if you like a warm fuzzy welcome).  Really nice touches were the Krups coffee machine and tablet in room for use.  The best thing was that after going to the O2 to see Kylie, we were travelling in the opposite direction to the crowd!  Would definitely stay here again.",5,2014,10,24
119,Ok. Large rooms. ,"Not bad, I stayed during the soft opening where they hadn't set up a permanent bar yet so I got a great discount on my room, not sure id pay the 400+  they're asking for now... In fact I wouldn't. But for 150 Pn it was fine. Large rooms friendly staff in need of slightly more training however as I said it was the soft opening. 
Nice deck bar area with good view of docklands. Right next to excel, I will definitely be staying here when I visit excel I instead of my usual crash pad, the ibis over the road ",3,2014,10,24
119,Floating Hotel Experience!!,"Stayed on the yacht for one night earlier this week,and was not disappointed. From start to finish the staff were first class,taking bags to our cabins,showing us the wifi etc.
Cleanliness was first class,the beds were roomy and comfortable.
The sandwich we had before going out was a little expensive,but presentation and setting more than made up for it.
Breakfast the next morning was first class again, a selection of fried,cold meats,cereals,croissants and plenty of tea and coffee.
Altogether a very memorable experience.",5,2014,10,23
119,"A stunning,unusual,luxurious way to enjoy your stay in london","I am at this very moment sitting in my cabin with my daughter on the Sunborn London and must say what a way to stay its stunning ,staff are superb the beds are so comfortable and the facilities on board all go towards making this one of the best hotels in london,we will definitely rebook for Christmas and next  year and also advise family and friends to give it a try,nothing prepares you for the 1st view of this amazing ship 10 out of 10 goes to the staff.
Thanks for reading 
Mr Mitchell & Ellie",5,2014,10,22
119,Bed on a Boat,"Very convenient for the City Airport. The rooms are a good size, although the bathroom was a little small - probably due to the way the boat is laid out. If you are visiting from Europe it has electric sockets for both UK and European standard plugs! Also surprisingly wuiet despite being so near to the City Airport.",4,2014,10,22
119,Interesting....,"Was looking for somewhere close to London City Airport as I had an early flight.  Decently priced I decided to give it a go. Room itself was spacious and well kitted out, however I was on a lower floor than expected and there was no outdoor space. However.... Taxi driver couldn't find it and even though next to Exel, there were no events on so it really felt like a ghost town. Would I stay there again? Possibly yes with my family as somewhere different and easily accessible via the DLR.",4,2014,10,22
119,Great Stay,"Had a lovely weekend stay in London.  The hotel was excellent, stayed in a executive king room over looking the river, very clean and comfortable, we were lucky enough to get a very good deal.

Staff very helpful and friendly, the bar staff made some impressive cocktails. All in all we had a wonderful stay. The concierge Claudio ensured we had everything we needed.

119,"Yes, it's a super yacht. Super experience. Super service.","The sunborn is not exactly like any other hotel as I'm sure you can imagine. The regal and royal entrance to the sunborn clearly already infects you with a quality and high standard sense of feel when and it doesn't disappoint. The rooms are to the highest standard you will find and the restaurant food is absolutely first class. I personally met some business clients there and it's a show stopping venue to impress. It is also very personal in terms of service, with the staff being so professionally attentive which is rare when going to high quality venues, especially somewhere as grand as the sunborn.... I was expecting a possibly pretentious feel with the standard being so high but it was anything but. The staff were all friendly and welcoming and at your service! Located perfectly to get into London or if you were visiting the excel, I would stay here even I needed to be on the other side of London, as access to all major routes is simple. I will be returning to the sunborn very soon and would rate it as one of the top, quality and most unique places to stay in the uk. Top marks captain!",5,2014,10,21
119,Certainly a bit diferent,"Well, it turned out the way we'd expected it to be, having read previous reviews. Spacious, spotless room; attentive and pleasant staff - and good food in the restaurant. Would stay again. A bit out if the way, and not a lot to do close by.",5,2014,10,21
119,Fantastic customer service,"We stayed on Monday 13th October. The whole experience was fabulous - we were greeted by the duty manager at the reception, who was extremely friendly, polite, helpful and courteous. As we walked around the boat, all the staff were very polite and spoke to you and when I picked up the phone to order some fresh milk for my tea, I was greeted by my surname and the milk was brought to us in less than 5 minutes.
Our room was beautiful and I felt like we were on a luxury yacht cruise (I wish we were!). We had a kingsize bed which was very comfortable and we had 2 pillows each, one lovely and soft and the other was a firmer one. The carpet was very plush and we also had a lounge area, although we did book the executive room. The coffee maker was nice and easy to use and a nice touch. The night views were great, but the sound of the planes taking off from The City Airport were a bit noisy, but to be expected when you stay next to an airport, although they only seemed to run to around 10pm and start around 7am, so not a huge problem.
We didn't eat on board; we did think the charge of £19 was a bit steep for breakfast.
I realise we had a special deal on the rates but if there are deals in the future we would definitely stay here again and would thoroughly recommend this yacht Hotel.",4,2014,10,21
119,Highly recommend!,"I booked a room on the gorgeous sunborn yacht as a surprise for my partner's 40th birthday. Since booking the room I broke my ankle so contacted the team, who were really helpful - to inform them I now had reduced mobility and needed wheelchair access.

On arrival to the hotel, we were greeted by warm and friendly staff, who were aware of our situation and they had kindly upgraded our room to an executive suite so I was able to manoeuvre more easily on the same floor; as well as they took the time to hand-write a note wishing my partner a happy birthday, leaving him some truffles in our room. How thoughtful!

We were really touched by the personal touch as well as the thoughtfulness and kindness everyone showed us during our stay.

The hotel itself is beautiful, the breakfast we opted for was first class, as well as finding the room perfect - well appointed,  spacious, comfortable and having all the little touches; such as a coffee machine, tablet to use and dressing gowns and slippers! 

I just wanted to say thank you to the sunborn for making our stay so much easier and most enjoyable. It's great value for money, something that little bit different and a real treat for a London getaway. Highly recommend!

",5,2014,10,21
119,A great 30th birthday present,"This hotel is something very special from the warm and personal welcome you get upon arrival right through to the spacious rooms.
I booked this for my friends 30th birthday present so me and my friends all stayed there! 
Dinner was an absolute delight with great service! 
The bar men all knew there stuff recommending great cocktails and wines for us to have on the large deck where you have a great view of the water and Canary Wharf. 
I can't praise this hotel enough and I very much look forward to staying there again in the future. 
A special mention to the wonderful reception team who were always professional but we're personal all at the same time. ",5,2014,10,21
119,A really smooth crossing........,"Perfect for our visit to an exhibition at the Excel Arena in Docklands, this luxury yacht is a terrific experience.  Room was excellent, with first-class fixtures & fittings.  Lovely restaurant serving gourmet food & wine.  Very attentive staff, for whom nothing was too much trouble.  Excel entrance 150 yards away, next to London DLR - you can be at Tower Bridge in 15 minutes.",5,2014,10,21
119,Fab experience and top notch customer service,"We stayed on Saturday 18th October. The entire experience was outstanding and deserves a greater description than the following points can cover, but in no particular order:

1. Outstanding customer service - everything done with a smile and nothing was too much trouble (including bringing extra milk to the room)
2. Food in the bar was great (though a touch over priced for the amount you receive). Tasty and hot, and arrived quickly. Cocktails were delicious too!
3. Personal touches made all the difference - on booking I advised that the stay was due to a birthday and we received a lovely hand written note and some 50% off drink vouchers which was very much appreciated.
4. Location is a little out of the way but ideal for Excel/O2 and takes a little over half an hour to get to Kings Cross.
5. Beds were super comfortable, room was spotless, lovely plush carpet, nice coffee maker, lovely added touch of the Sony tablet - all very luxe.
6. Although there was a long queue at check in around 4pm, the front of house staff were dealing with people in an effective and time efficient manner.
7. Great views across the Thames - especially at sunset.
8. We were in one of the more 'basic' rooms and it was by no means basic! Large, airy and tastefully decorated.

I would absolutely stay again - a novel experience staying on a 'Boatel' which has a genuinely high standard.",5,2014,10,20
119,Price had doubled ?,"Such a shame sunborn have took huge advantage of the good reviews, I paid £120 per night 4 weeks ago , this was the general price per room on all web sites, then i noticed 2 weeks later it was £140 it has now doubles to £240, such a shame was definitely going to plan another stay but not at that price, don't think they are doing themselves any favours as it was pretty empty when we stayed and only 3 couples dining that evening!  Such a shame as I'd recommended to so many people that I doubt will bother now, knowing of the price hike. Shame.",4,2014,10,20
119,One night not enough!,Stayed on 17/10/2014 good setting with stunning views. Receptionist very polite and informative and very kindly gave us a complementary upgrade when we said we were there for our anniversary. All staff very friendly especially the duty manager who circulated and checked all guests in the bar were happy. Room spacious and clean with very comfy bed. Breakfast was good and we had been warned of busy times. All round a fantastic unique hotel. Can't wait to stay again.,5,2014,10,19
119,Fun to stay on a boat ,Easily found (next to Excel) and fun to stay on a boat but get a room with a balcony because floor 2 doesn't have windows you can open and the air con was a bit rubbish. Great breakfast though and something a little different ,4,2014,10,19
119,Sumptuous retreat with the WOW factor,"We booked 2 rooms at the Sunborn to accommodate ourselves and relative from Mallorca. She particularly wanted to check out the conference facilities for her business there. We arrived early but were quickly checked into our rooms by the incredibly pleasant and helpful staff. The rooms were outstanding in every way ad was the rest of the ship. We had a fantastic view of the river and skyline, Wi Fi and a tablet, an iron and board dressing gowns etc. Lunch on the back deck of the bar was simple but good and not too expensive. 
Breakfast the next morning was excellent, plenty of choice which was replenished regularly and the table service slick.
We found Ian the Manager? delightful and he couldn't do enough for us. We were able to leave our bags at the hotel after check out while we did a trip to Greenwich.
We would recommend this unusual hotel to anyone with its good transport links, DLR and Cable Car, it's proximity to the O2 and Excel.",5,2014,10,19
119,Perfect stay,"I can't praise the staff highly enough, throughly professional and helpful. We arrived early to check our bags in and were told that as the room was ready we could have the key 3 hours early.
Great room with a river view, king size bed even in a standard room plus tablet and free wifi provided. A great base for the 02, only down side was that it's a bit dark and deserted to walk back from the Emirates airline at night.",5,2014,10,17
119,Would definitely  recommend ,"I stayed on the sunborne on 14/10/2014 because we were at a concert at the 02 arena.
The yacht is amazing, cabins spacious and well decorated.  The staff are really helpful and friendly. Our room wasn't ready when we were checking in so we had a complementary drink in the bar.
Would definitely go back if we were staying in that area of London again.
",5,2014,10,17
119,staff issues,"We treated ourselves and a friend for his birthday to an overnight visit to the Sunborn.   The boat is beautiful and the rooms are very nice, although a steam iron rather than the non steam would have been better but our main gripe was the staffing issues.  The receptionists and concierge were very pleasant but we were kept waiting nearly 15 minutes to check in.  Breakfast was a farce, the staff were moving at a glacial pace and again we had to wait for nearly 20mins to be seated.  I even said i will clear a table and re lay if it means we can get sat down, no apology only we will do it now....... once seated the buffet was not being replenished because the few staff were gliding around the restaurant laying 1 piece of cutlery at a time.  We paid ten pounds for a rather poor do.   No eggs, no bacon, no hash browns and when they did arrive they disappeared quickly because everyone was waiting on it. The continental selection was no better.     Get your management of staff sorted please",3,2014,10,16
119,Absolutely brilliant!,"Myself and my partner decided to stay as a mini break. We booked the room for only £120 and we were scared to find out what the catch was. We were pleasantly surprised to find out there was none! The room was absolutely beautiful and very large - together with a private balcony overlooking the river. Amazing views and the bed was more than comfortable. Highly recommended this hotel, one of the best I have ever stayed in. the only downside was there is no parking. The closest available parking was at the excel centre, at about a 15 minute walk. Everything else was flawless, could not fault at all.",5,2014,10,16
119,What a 40th!,"Had the privilege of staying on board for my 40th and my wifes birthday the following day (30th Sept & 1st Oct). Location is about 20 mins from Waterloo change onto DLR at Canning Town and head towards Beckton getting off at the next stop, head over footbridge cross over road and through the gap in the buildings and turn left at the dockside...the view you get of The Sunborn is amazing. Upon checkin we were allocated a riverside room with a balcony....WHAT A ROOM! Never before have I said Wow so much, for London standards the room was big, plush carpet....fridge for our vino and huge comfy bed. Now im not one to stay in a room for long but my god time slipped by on that balcony in the sun very quickly. The staff were brilliant...check in was very quick, followed 20mins later by a knock on our door (3022) by the duty manager with a fantastic letter wishing us a happy birthday and drinks voucher. Very quiet area...the aircraft are no bother it feels like your our private bit of London. I never usually write reviews but I have to say my 40th Birthday will never be forgotten this place is that special. As a Hotel Duty Manager myself I know how hard it is to make the guest experience so special but these guys did it in reems so much so I just had to give the Reception team a nice tip. Thank you Sunborn really cant wait to return hopefully a December or Jan visit is on the cards. To the lady who was moaning about things next to us on checkout....do yourself a favour next time and pay more to stay at Travellodge or Premier Inn you really didnt have anything to moan about! Sunborn London and its regular guests really dont need you. Thankyou again you have a fab team see you soon!",5,2014,10,16
119,Fab stay,We booked this hotel for 1 night while at excel. We were looking foward to our stay as this is something a little different and we were not disappointed the room was very comfortable and clean all the staff were very helpfull. The breakfast is also very good plenty of choice and good quality for a surprising small amount. Very happy will be back soon,5,2014,10,13
119,Excellent Hotel,Great hotel. Rooms are stylish and spacious and always very clean. Hotel staff are friendly and helpful. The hotel has a decent bar which is open 24 hours which is always a positive. There is also a very nice restaurant and the breakfast in the morning is very good!,5,2014,10,13
119,Fantastic Experience,"I've been to Sunborn a few times, and it has been a great experience every single time. The rooms are very spacious,  the staff are very friendly, and the look and feel of the yacht give you a different feeling about the hotel, something you wont find in normal hotels. If you decide to visit Sunborn, I recommend you to try the Sunborn burgher, you can thank me later. Also try and get a room with a balcony, facing the canal. Before I finish, a special mention to a particular member of the staff, Ian Platt, the Financial Controller for the hotel, great host and very friendly.",5,2014,10,13
119,Poor. Poor. Poor,"Such a shame. An otherwise beautiful hotel but the stay ruined by appalling service. 

45 minute wait for breakfast, uncooked sausages. 

No availability for dinner as a resident in the restaurant. 

Nobody wanted to know and I sensed so many other customers were complaining. Especially at breakfast. 

Needless to stay I shan't be returning. ",2,2014,10,12
119,Nice rooms......atrocious service!!!,"The room was lovely except no feather pillows and advertised coffee machine missing. I ordered feather pillows via their tablet in the room but they never arrived. Drinks and food overpriced!! Service terrible......some staff couldn't understand basic English, wrong drinks given, ran out of mixer. On 2nd day breakfast was a disaster....no hot food, ended up leaving the restaurant after 20 mins of waiting. Spoke to manager before leaving , who promised to speak with her manager and get back to us.....weeks later we are still waiting!!!",2,2014,10,12
119,Couldn't fault it!,"I stayed here last weekend while  attending the Excel. It is a great place to stay and the accommodation is spacious, light and roomy. We had a basic room and the port window was very nice. The whole hotel seemed very quiet at night, which is a good thing. There is very good security as you need your card to swipe into the lift to get to each floor. The bathrooms only seem to have a shower, which was fine with us. 
The two things I would say is that the customer service is beyond excellent! Especially Nazma on Reception and Claudio the concierge. I hope that is how you spell their names! 
Both were extremely helpful, friendly and really made us feel welcome. When I went up to reception (we were on floor 2 reception is on floor 3) all the staff on reception turned to me, with a smile, and all at the same time asked ""how can we help you?'
Also Nazma really tried to learn how to say my name, which is difficult if you have never seen it before.
The second thing was, we didn't have a coffee machine in the room and after I went up to ask about one, within minutes we had one, the lady who brought it explained how it worked and was generally very friendly, very happy. The hotel offers free wifi (which is something we look for when we book a hotel)
The boat is well equipped and the bar is very nice. Get a nice night and you can easily sit out on the deck with a glass of wine! 
The hotel is going to have a spa and with that I think they have a winning idea.
The hotel is close to the DLR, the Ecel (obviously) and the o2 and Canary Wharf (by tube)
The price we paid was very reasonable and we would definitely go back - although we would probably upgrade to a room with a balcony! 
If you want somewhere different, with excellent customer service and staff who actually do seem to want to help you, at a reasonable price in London go for this one.",5,2014,10,11
119,2nd honeymoon,Recently spend 2 nights here as a mini honeymoon couldn't of picked a better hotel the beds were comfortable and spacious balcony looking out to the dock and city airport which we didn't hear at all overall expensive to eat and drink there but worth the money to stay there.,5,2014,10,10
119,London overnighter,"Overall thought excellent for the price paid ( £180 for a Saturday night stay, decent sized room with a balcony view over the dock, breakfast & a couple of complementary drinks ) & it has to bring a smile if only for the slight novelty & wow factor's - it doe's look good as you approach. If any small criticism it'd be although only opened June 2014, the wood, brass & glass decor is a tad 80's & hotel information on the in-room tablets had slight issues & had to visit reception for photocopy of room service menu. Ok when arrived though & breakfast good. Staff were lovely & helpful ( but juggling a lot of balls ). Finally it may seem a bit out the way for some, but Customs House & Royal Victoria DLR stations are only minutes away. Would go again in a heartbeat.",4,2014,10,09
119,comfortable hotel,"I agree with what others have said; the rooms are large, the beds comfy etc. Liked the Molten Brown products in the bathroom (the door scraped all the skin off my ankle so, like another reviewer said, beware!). A few minor details, ie cups that are larger than thimbles for coffee, and glasses that are larger than thimbles for water would be good. we stayed for a week and took paper cups from a coffee shop back with us for a decent cuppa in the morning. Wine glasses would have been nice too. we didn't go to the bar or restaurant; too expensive. The location is good if you need it for excel; otherwise we found docklands pretty soul-less and wouldn't stay here again. the boat is near the DLR and transport is pretty efficient. my only real gripe is that every morning I have been woken at 6am by someone next door, or maybe above us, stomping about. My bed has literally shaken every time he's taken a step. don't know if that's something to do with the floorboards but it's like having a baby elephant nearby. otherwise, the cabins are well soundproofed and you barely hear the planes that fly literally overhead on the way to London City Airport.",4,2014,10,08
119,Life on the open sea....,"Myself and a couple of friends stayed at the Sunborn last weekend, great hotel, in a great location....we were in town to attend a function at the xcel centre so it was perfect! 

The price was very good too (just over £200) for a great sized room! The only drawback would be the added £40 per night they require to ""secure"" against any meals. However, you do get it back quite quickly if a credit card is used.... I'll update this if I have any issues...

Thoroughly recommended hotel, pleasant staff, decent food.",4,2014,10,07
119,Wonderful Hotel and Restaurant,"We spent a lovely day in rainy London with friends visiting from New Zealand after twenty three years. Our celebration lunch on board the Sunborn yacht was superb. The food was fantastic and has maintained the highest standard since our last visit. The staff were sociable, attentive and unobtrusive and couldn't do enough for us. We would highly recommend the experience. 

On a previous visit to London in July, we stayed aboard and look forward to doing so again.

The concept of a yacht hotel is inspirational.

Thank you.",5,2014,10,06
119,Fabulous find,"Amazing location, fab greeting, great service throughout and made to feel very special. Best hotel I have ever stayed at, and compared to our previous night in London at Park Lane, it beat that hands down.n",5,2014,10,06
119,Special Treat,"After watching a glorious victory at Fulham 0-Blackburn Rovers 1, we travelled across London and gave the kids the name of the hotel but nothing more.  As we approached on foot from Excel DLR, they were amazed to see our hotel for one night.  Really, we're staying there?  Does it go anywhere?  

We boarded by lift straight to Reception and checked in with ease.  As we had prepaid and booked through an agent we did not know that a credit card was required to secure £40 against the loss of the Ipad in our room/cabin.  The kids were stunned to see an Ipad in a hotel room.

The room was very large.  Six foot wide bed for us and the kids had a spacious double settee bed. We paid £119.00 for room only.  The cheapest I think at the time.  We were on the river level with a large port hole panoramic window on the riverside.  Fancy Lavazza coffee machine in room.

Good location.  Short walk along quayside to the Emirates Cable Car across to the O2 Arena.  Concert was on our side of the river with free firework display.  Tesco Metro with discounted sandwiches for supper and cheap beer and cider.  There was a mini bar in our room, but no-one was allowed to touch it!

Excellent night's sleep, very comfortable beds.  

Went back along riverside to local cafe for a cooked breakfast for £3.95 and mug of tea for £1.00 and checked out quickly.

One issue - take care with your fingers - the bathroom door is very heavy and nearly trapped our son's hand.

Second issue - we are English - we need tea, two tea bags for an overnight stay is not enough!  Don't like asking for more, but surely we could - housekeeping came very promptly to make up the kid's bed, when it turned out it was already made when we reached our room.  Note to Sunborn hotel, when you allocate a room to the locals, increase the tea allocation!

Third issue - there were four of us, but only two coffee cups and saucers - this happens a lot.

Issues one, two and three made no difference, however, ultimately to a very splendid stay.  Shame the hotel prices have now gone up and we probably won't be able to have a special treat again here.",5,2014,10,04
119,excellent!!!,just got back from the sunborn after a weekend away with my girlfriend and was perfect!! hotel is VERY modern and staff are very helpful and best bed ive ever slept in!! very good location as we went to o2 one night!!,5,2014,10,02
119,Fantastic experience,"Stayed here for my wifes birthday as a surprise and it was a wonderful experience to stay on a ""super yacht"". The staff and management were very helpful throughout and the boat itself was just amazing. Will 100% be back.

We purchased the ""romantic"" package which was expertly done with swans on our bed (see photo) and I'd asked for prosecco they'd run out and kindly gave us champagne for no extra cost. We had cocktails on the deck at the front of the boat several times and they were great. We didnt eat in the restaurant.

The emirates cable car was a really fun way of travelling over to the o2 and from there you could get the underground into the city. This shut at 9pm though.

The only slight down sides were:
1) The distance from central london, meant several undergound and DLR stops. In the end we just taxi'd into the city and back at a cost of around £35 each way.
2) The flight path.. during the day this was pretty noisy, but with the double glazing you couldn't hear very much

Apart from that it was a very enjoyable experience and we'll be 100% be back. The spa was due to open on the day we left so will look forward to that on a return trip.

Thanks to all the staff for making it so memorable.",4,2014,10,01
119,Fantastic!,"My wife and I were visiting relatives outside of London.  We decided to stay inside the City, which would allow us to experience London at night.  We chose the Sunborn because it was well rated and a good value.

The Sunborn was easily accessed via the Docklands Light Rail.  It was a short walk from the rail station with an added bonus, a Tesco Express Store on the way.

The front desk staff were outstanding; friendly and efficient.  The standard room we booked was very large and well appointed.  

The only criticism that we had was the cost of breakfast;  £19.00 per person.  We walked the short distance to the Ibis Hotel and paid £9.00 per person.

The Sunborn is a great place to stay.",5,2014,10,01
119,Amazing from start to finish!,"I stayed here for my birthday and it was absolutely amazing! The yacht is beautiful and the location is stunning... And more than that the service is second to none - thank you Claudio!!! 

Highly recommend it and take the cable car on your way there or home...! Will definitely be coming back ",5,2014,09,30
119,"Nice hotel, just a few minor things to improve on","We visited 26th-29th September 2014.
A great looking hotel, but a few minor complaints. 
The aircon still makes a bit of noise, even when switched off.
The pillows do not have pillow protectors on them, and as a result, smelled a bit sweaty from other guests. I asked for all four to be changed, but they were still the same ones when we returned in the evening.
The hotel is on the landing/take off flight path for London City Airport. Whilst the soundproofing is good, it can't stop all of the noise from an aircraft overflying at about 500 feet.
The spa is not open at the time of writing, this was not advised at the time of booking.
It takes 40 minutes to get from the hotel to Leicester Square - not a complaint, but worth bearing in mind if you're going to the theatre.
All in all, we enjoyed our stay, but wouldn't use it again.",3,2014,09,30
119,fab hotel,Excellent hotel with outstanding customer service. We got upgraded to the river view with balcony as it was our wedding anniversary.  We had a personal hand written letter congratulating us. This is a must stay hotel.,5,2014,09,29
119,Birthday celebration,"Had a great time celebrating sister in laws 50th birthday, arrived around 14.00 and annoyed to find expedia had only sent through the booking for 1 room, Andreas the manager dealt with this quickly and then upgraded us to executive rooms overlooking the water which were great as it was a special occasion
We had also booked a table for dinner but were a bit wary as it was fine dinning and no steak and chips but we all really enjoyed the food from shoulder of lamb, chicken cotswold to sea bass, then retired to the comfy lounge bar for some drinks to end a perfect day.
Special thanks to Andreas who took the time to write a note hoping we had a lovely time celebrating the 50th birthday which we did,
Would definitely go again and eat on board as food was great, fantastic views from ship at night towards canary wharf.",5,2014,09,29
119,Stunning views and lovely hotel,"My friend and I had passed here one day and went in, looked around and decided to come here for a night with our partners. Check in was a bit slow but everybody is very friendly,we both booked the same package but she got upgraded to a room with a balcony and I got the standard room, I was disappointed with that as it was my partners birthday, however, I was not going to let that spoil our weekend. Whenever you go all the staff are very polite. I loved our bed and the room was very spacious, the only downside to me was there was a humming noise throughout the night (could be the engines or fans working. I love the idea of an ipad in your room. The bar I personally found overpriced and when we asked if our gin was a double or single, the barman was not sure and said he would have to find out(!!!) (he eventually came back and said it was £10 for a double but it sure did not taste like a double. We did not eat on the boat as the restaurant was full, We opted for the breakfast, dont think there is much variety, it was full and I think they could not cope with the amount of people that came down for breakfast. There was no fried egg and when we asked one of the waitress for some she said it would be a few min, my partner waited for about 5min and then again asked someone else and she said it would be 5min, we decided to have the scramble eggs. It took about 20min for the eggs to come out, they were slow in replenishing the food. If I did stay there again would not have the breakfast. Overall a great experience.",5,2014,09,29
119,Fantastic!,"After a few days at an expo in Earls Court, we treated ourselves to a night on Sunborn. I was sceptical as there didn't really seem to be much around the area aside from a few bars, restaurants, and the excel centre.
As soon as we walked in at 9pm we were greeted by smiling, pleasant staff, who wanted nothing more than to ensure we had a good time. When we arrived to our classic king room I was amazingly surprised, it was a lot bigger than the photo suggested! We also had the romance package, so there were 2 pairs of swans, some luxury chocolates, and flower petals. The bathroom is a little bit cramped, but everything else is perfect and I couldn't have asked for more. It was quiet, close enough to shops that as room service wasn't available during the soft opening, it didn't really matter, soft carpets, soft bed, all in all, I was a very happy camper! Yes, the drinks are overpriced, but for the amount we paid, we didn't really mind that much.",5,2014,09,28
119,Terrible Room Location,"I'm currently staying at this Sunborn Hotel because I was led to believe that the room I booked has great view and a balcony.  To my great disappointment, the room that I booked does not only not have a balcony, but they can only offer me a room facing the entrance below the ground level, like a basement apartment where passing by people can stare down at you.  I just would not even bother to open the curtain. I requested a change of room but they give me the usual hotel is fully booked excuse.  I was so excited to share a super yacht experience with my family that they claimed to offer and at the end it's just a big disappointment.",1,2014,09,27
119,Super Yacht,stayed at the Sunborn Yacht on numerous occasions for business. Fantastic staff with fantastic surroundings will use again! Rooms are spacious with excellent fixtures. Great sun deck which is great to relax on with a drink with superb views of Canary Wharf.,5,2014,09,26
119,Superb.,"Great stay. Nice touches like UK and European power sockets, Sony tablets, Molton Brown toiletries, dressing gown & slippers. Minutes from LCY and only 20 minutes to Bank via DLR. Very comfortable, quiet and clean. Friendly staff, nice food. Stay here you'll love it.",5,2014,09,25
119,Fantastic hotel,"What a wonderful place to stay. Even better than I expected.
The staff were very friendly and couldn't do enough to help.
Food was excellent and so well presented. 
Very lucky to have been upgraded and the rooms are spacious and very comfortable with superb views.
So good, can't wait to go back! Looking at dates now.",5,2014,09,25
119,Great Hotel,"First time I have stayed and had four great nights ,clean room nice staff .For London city Airport and any docklands business .Will be using this hotel again .I use the London Airport a lot and stayed in other hotels ,never again",5,2014,09,25
119,Fantastic value and high quality food,"We stayed at Sunborn as we were travelling. From City Airport. The room was very spacious with high quality fittings and we were in their lowest rated room a classic.  Service was  fantastic, staff were incredibly helpful and  could not do enough for us. Very comfortable bed and had a good nights sleep.
We ate in the restaurant and were wowed by the high quality of the food, the quality of service, and most of all by the value for money.. This was our best experience of eating in London.
Thank you to all of the staff, with a particular thank you to Claudio, for encouraging us to eat  at the restaurant and giving us a voucher getting us even better value for money, and Camilla of the housekeeping staff for helping us with the technology.
We are already booked in to return.",5,2014,09,24
119,Starboard Side Stay,"I stayed here after a batch of business meetings I had in the local area.  Had a lovely time and was very enjoyable.  The staff are friendly, approachable and keen to ensure you have as pleasant an experience as possible.

I saw in someone else's review that it is best to stay on the river side of the boat and on this I would have to agree. It provides the best views and completes the experience.

All in all, a nice variation from the standard hotels that are throughout London.  If you fancy a change and doing something a little different you can't really go wrong.",5,2014,09,24
119,Amazing,"Ill keep it simple suprise from my husband for his birthday. Staff fantastic everything fantastic cant fault it.staff should have a medal for putting up with some customers who in all honestly moaned about everything if you were that rich you should have stayed at the savoy !! 
Brilliant stay cant wait to go back ",5,2014,09,24
119,Underwhelmed. ,"We were intrigued as to what the boat was and we went to investigate after visiting the wedding fair at the excel. 

We sat at the table and were the only people in the resuarant , you would think you would get a good service. This was not the case. 

The limited menu was shortened by a number of dishes that they had run out of. 
We ordered the food and waited well over 40 minutes for it. 

When the food was served I had the shredded lamb which in fairness was very nice I then waited a further 10 minutes for the mash and vegtables. The vegetables which were meant to be green beans and shallots had so much garlic on you would think there was a war on against vampires. 

We asked for the bill which was a challenge. 

There card machine failed halfway through the transaction so they got another machine which did the same. I had two card payments pending and they wanted further payment. 

I was extremely frustrated by this and was told I needed to wait for a supervisor. A coach load then arrived for approximately 30 people for afternoon tea and the supervisor sat every single one of them before coming to sort out issue. 

In the way out I decided to inform the reception desk of my disappointment and criticism and I was met with them telling me they were still in their soft opening phase. 

It's such a shame for the staff working on such a stunning vessel to deliver this level of service. 
",1,2014,09,23
119,Supposed to be a superyaght - more like a ferry,"Booked this last minute for a shopping trip to London, expecting it to be a bit different and expecting  fairly high standards based on the previous reviews and the description on their website.

DONT BE FOOLED, this is not a luxury hotel - at best it is a poor business hotel. The room is OK, but similar to a small room you would expect in a regular business hotel. 

I understood that at the time of our visit (September 2014) the hotel was in a period of a soft launch so I can forgive the staff for the lack of training but it seemed they were not trained at all! 

The only good points are the good view along the Thames if you have a room on the right side of the boat - the other side would be a view of the Excel Conference Centre, and the view from the bar at the back of the boat. Though the service in the bar is disjointed and generally bad quality. For example, our drinks arrived with complimentary bowl of nuts, but it looked as if the nuts had already been tucked into by a previous guest. 

I would not recommend this unless you are visiting Excel and want to be very close.",3,2014,09,23
119,stunning,"I stopped here for the night with my son. Brilliant service.Room was great. came home and raved about it to my husband booked for november for my birthday. Would like a river view if possible this time, but would be happy in any room to be fair.
Would recommend the breakfast.
Staff were very attentive.

Highly recommend.

Thanks",5,2014,09,21
119,5 stare service at luxury Yacht hotel,Stayed over and held our wedding lunch here and the whole experience was just amazing. Every single member of staff was so helpful. The boat is just beautiful and the food was amazing. We had a suite booked with a big balcony and separate living are. Totally worth it. If you dine in the restaurant make sure you have the cheesecake - You won't regret it!,5,2014,09,19
119,A bit of Wolf-on-Wall-Street class,"I was looking for somewhere special to stay for a birthday celebration and found this fabulous classy yacht hotel which has just recently opened in the Docklands area.  It is jaw-droppingly beautiful and yes - a tad hard to find off the DLR - you need to cross over to the right side of the station and then straight through the gap between the buildings, across the road to the river's edge and turn left.  Part of the experience is seeing the yacht for the first time.  It really makes you feel as if you are walking into a film set (well, I admit, I may lead a fairly sheltered life compared to some :) ).  My husband, whose treat it was, loved it as did our two, now quite well-travelled sons.
Really large, sumptuously appointed rooms.  It felt bad walking on the cream piled carpet in your shoes - I just can't see how they are going to keep it clean for long.  We really loved having a drink on our balcony over-looking the Royal Docks and watching the sun go down.  Free wi-fi in the rooms and the Sony tablet is a nice touch.  Good flat-screen TV.  Very comfy beds.  Nespresso machine in the room broke down on our first night but it was quickly replaced with one that worked.  Staff are very friendly.
O2 is a tube-ride away with as many restaurants to eat in as you'd like.  Do the cable car ride over the river at least once.
We did breakfast once on our two night stay but we've had better and ate out on the second day.
For something special and whilst the novelty lasts I'd really recommend the Sunborn for a stay in London.",5,2014,09,15
119,A lovely experience,"We piloted this hotel for our 7th year anniversary and were impressed even before we got there. On the phone, the reservation team proved to be immensely helpful once they found out the purpose of our visit. We booked the Junior Suite, and were positively surprised when on arrival had been upgraded to the Master. The warmth of the staff, especially the reservation team, was first class. We felt quite at ease with everyone. Also, the concierge was very helpful and friendly. My wife loved the room and liked the cosy ambience. The deck overlooking the calm river and London's financial district was gorgeous, especially at night. The bathroom (size galore with a jacuzzi) also made for a beautiful touch. The hotel's food was also quite tasty.

All in all, it was very good and would have been a clear 5 star experience but for the lack of parking, slight loss at the point of entry (bigger and better sign-posts and directions would help), a lovely sauna in the suite that we were really looking forward to using, but didn't work despite the staff's best effort (these things do happen, but should ideally be pre-empted) and slightly pricey meals for the Michelin-sized portions. 

All in all though, a good and wonderful hotel that I wouldn't hesitate recommending. It's always worthwhile calling out staff members that did exceptionally well and exceeded the call of duty, the undoubted first of which is Nazma (Reservations), then Alessandro (Concierge) and Apostolas (the Manager) who very kindly hand-wrote my wife and I a nice, personal note to welcome and wish us a lovely anniversary, and they all made sure of it.

We will be re-visiting and a warm thank you and well done to the team, especially Nazma, for making our day and experience memorable.",4,2014,09,14
119,Yacht Hotel A Novelty,If you have always wanted to sleep on a luxury yacht this is your chance!  Sunborn is a yacht permanently moored at a dock in East London conveniently located near a large ExCel convention centre in docklands and to the DLR train service which connects to the tube.  Look for deals.  The hotel has a few issues: At night there is very poor exterior lighting and some people may find that intimidating.  There was an issue with air conditioning which resulted in moving staterooms. Beds were not that comfortable but the staterooms are well appointed with flat screen television and a small Ipad computer...nice touch.  There is a strong smell of cleaning fluid in the hallways. I would stay here for the novelty or if you were attending an event at the convention centre.  You must feel comfortable using the excellent public transportation system as docklands is rather far away from central London.,3,2014,09,14
119,Something different,"We stayed here for one night this past week.  
Check in was easy and fast.  I had intentionally booked a room with a King and pull-out so that we would have more space.  The receptionist said that she would change it to just a King for us as this was a ""family"" room.  I'm not sure why she'd make that change - they price was the same.  Then we got to our room and it was a King with pull-out!  Very odd.  
We opted not to eat on the yacht as it was far too expensive.  We read the reviews before coming and decided to eat elsewhere.
The room was lovely.  Very unique, nicely decorated. Actually, larger than many rooms in the London area.  We had a harbour view.  We had a porthole and not a balcony - that was disappointing.
There was no drinking water in the room - somehow on a yacht, this seemed important to me. There was a coffee maker but no tea.  
When I pay extra for a hotel room, I simply expect a few extras.  There were none here.  
The bed was very comfortable and quiet.  We had a great sleep.  I was concerned about it floating as I get motion illness.  No rocking whatsoever - very well docked.  Simply not a concern.
The bathroom door could not be left open - it slams shut behind you every time.  We had to carry a chair over to prop it open.  I suspect this is a boating thing - but it was frustrating.
The bar was lovely but expensive.  The views were very nice.  
Overall, we really enjoyed our night there.  It is expensive so you need to just accept that before you book.",4,2014,09,13
119,Nice stay,"My husband and I stayed at the sunborn in August 2014. We had to wait about 5mins to check in due to a queue which didn't bother us at all but whilst checking in we were told we would be given an upgrade due to our wait - exec room with a balcony overlooking the Thames. The room was lovely - good size, coffee machine, tablet, ironing board + iron, amazing Molton brown toiletries and a surprisingly good hair dryer. We thought the breakfast was quite pricey at £17 each so didn't have it. We felt that was just too much for the location and was better value to go elsewhere. There is a tesco express nearby, a few restaurants and a deli/bakery. Drinks in the bar were reasonably priced. Overall, a good stay in a very nice hotel with a great concept. We would come back if the price didn't become extortionate.",4,2014,09,12
119,Perfect Adult Getaway,"A perfect place to wind down and chill or a perfect base to enjoy the attractions and night life London has to offer.
The Yacht itself is stunning - modern, clean and surprisingly spacious. The room was far more spacious than anticipated and the little balcony over looking the Thames is a welcome treat for any smoker. The staff were polite and helpful at all times and willingly gave us a tour of the decks and sun terraces. Food and drinks were good and on par with average London prices. 
This little gem us close enough to access all the London attractions yet also far enough away if peace and quiet is the order of your stay. 
We will definitely be returning very soon.",5,2014,09,12
119,WEEKEND IN LONDON,"Just spent a long weekend in London and stayed on the sunborn thought it would be different and it was. the staff were very friendly, the rooms were large and very well equipped we had a balcony overlooking the river so great view. it was great sitting at rear of boat having a drink also good to see drinks were not overpriced. location was good not too noisy other than planes going along themes  but 3 minute walk to railway and train straight in to London central O2 was  a short trip, as well local restaurants with in 2 minute walk had breakfast at a small café on the dock side about 2 minute off boat £3.99 for a great fresh cooked breakfast a real deal a great start for the day. would I go again and stay on sunborn YES",4,2014,09,09
119,Pricey !,"Overall a good hotel! The food and drink are too expensive for its location. £5.00 for a 330ml bottle of beer far exceeds its retail value. And £14:00 for a club sandwich! Eh ?? . And when checking into a 4 star hotel I don't expect to be spoken to in a ""street"" manor ! Ain't, init, ya room, ava nice day ..... I am from a working class background myself but i sometimes like to avoid that limited street vocabulary.",4,2014,09,08
119,Luxury,"We did a one night stay with GB tours and the yacht is a floating palace. The furnishings and cabins are just as you would expect for a luxury yacht! 
Rooms and attention to detail were splendid and the breakfast was first class if a little cool! 
A word of warning though if you are a drinker, the bar prices are exorbitant to say the least! 
eg 2 bottles of lager £11.25! But this is after all how the other half live!",4,2014,09,08
119,50th Birthday,"We stayed onboard for two nights with our friends to celebrate my husbands 50th birthday.
The staff were very friendly and the hotel was very clean and the rooms were lovely all with balcony overlooking the docks.

I am so pleased we booked this to celebrate my husband's  50th Birthday.
Enjoyed our cocktails on the deck sitting in the sun.
Will be back again.",5,2014,09,08
119,Something different lots of pluses but some gripes,"We stayed on the Sunborn for 1 night as an anniversary treat, our welcome onboard was lovely a very nice, helpful and friendly receptionist booked us in. Our room was spacious and very clean, a couple of gripes though why provide robes but no slippers? The bathroom door slammed shut all the time, you couldn't have it open at all. Pillows were synthetic without the option of a change and whilst the balcony had two nice chairs there was no table. We had pre booked a table for dinner at 7.30 but they didn't have our reservation, so we were told we would have to come to the restaurant at 7.00 instead. Upon arrival however there was only one other couple seated and throughout the evening there were no more than 8 tables in use so not sure why this was the case? The meal was good though, well presented and the service was very attentive, we had to ask them to slow the meal down though, as we would have been finished in an hour otherwise!  No potato options for the dishes though which was odd, we were told we could have some creamed mash if we wanted potatoes. 
Breakfast was a different matter, although it all looked good and there was plenty of choice, the hot options were very slow to appear and then put into servers once it finally appeared but this was all in stages a couple of items at a time and it was all mostly lukewarm or cold. Service was very slow as well. We tried to complain but the waitress but did not seem to either understand or be bothered. Checkout was also slow, we were very overcharged on the bill some £250.00!! and we had other people around us with the same problem after a very long process when they finally acknowledged they had made mistakes (the receptionist had been insisting it was correct!) the bill was altered correctly. It was a novel stay certainly different from the usual London hotel and we would return but not dine there again.",4,2014,09,07
119,Unique experience and the comfiest beds in London!,"We booked last minute having been so disappointed with a hotel in Greenwich. We were so excited to arrive, the staff were all cheerfull and professional. Room is huge and immaculate with fantastic comfy bed. Sat on the sun deck with a drink a d watched the sun go down over the London skyline the took a cable ride over the Thames. Had the best nights sleep, its so quiet and dark. Wonderfull breakfast buffet with everything you could wish for and amazing views. Will definitely come again... Loved it! X",5,2014,09,07
119,Disapointing ...,"So we were really looking forward to this, sadly as soon as we arrived we had problems.

Rather than starting with cons, let me give the pros.

Pros

- One of the best beds I have ever slept in!  Perfect mix of firm and soft.
- Room size was really good for London and had a nice feel.  Standard rooms are basically junior suites in normal hotel terms.
- Sony tablet in the room
- Good TV
- Fast / simple access FREE internet
- Good shower

We did not eat on the ship, as the prices were eye watering and the menu just did not appeal.  If they had some AA Rosette's  or something to justify the price then we would have tried it.  After some googling we found the Italian Zero 70 just next to the Fox pub did amazing pizza.  So we cannot comment on any food / drink.

Cons

- We had booked at least a week in advance and got a good rate (£140).  There only seemed to be a few room types and could not tell the difference between Standard and Executive apart from what looked like a leather sofa v's fabric.  However, when we arrived at 2:30pm we were told over 50 people had already checked in and that there were no waterside rooms left.  We ended up in the bottom of the ship next to the wall / dock side, with a window without net curtains looking directly onto the tourists taking photos of the ship.  This meant we had to close our curtains all the time we were there.  Although the next morning I forgot, opened the curtains in my pants to find some tourist taking a photos of me!  

Now I understand that the ship has rooms on both sides, but they should offer this and explain at point of booking.  The reason they don't? Well its because it's done on arrival.  This is my complaint, seems that although you cannot arrive before 3pm which is normal, people had turned up early and bagged the best rooms.  The couple in front of us also checking in had the same problem.  They should either allocate rooms on booking which pretty much done on every cruise I have ever been on so you know exactly where on the ship you will be.  The better the location, the more the price.  I would have paid a bit more if that choice had been offered.  

One other point, on checking out they had taken a swipe of my debit card when checking in for extras.  We did not have any extras, but as it was a debit card they had no way to remove the block and said the money would be returned around 10 days later!!!  So pay cash deposit if you are using a debit card, credit cards are normally fine for blocks to be released.

So yes book a room on the Sunborn BUT totally ignore the 3pm check in time and get there EARLY if you want a room facing the water as you don't want one facing the dock!

All in all, such a shame, but after the disappointment on arrival there was no way to really come back from that. 

We won't be staying again, and as my partner is an events manager for a major bank booking huge numbers of rooms and event rooms a year a real missed opportunity.",2,2014,09,07
119,Excellent stay,"We have thoroughly enjoyed our 2 night stay on the sunborn. Room excellent, very spacious, lovely woodwork. Generally of a very high standard. Staff lovely and very helpful. Breakfast excellent full cooked, smoked salmon, cheeses etc etc 
Evening dinner was beautiful. Will definitely come again. ",5,2014,09,06
119,Ahoy,Myself and two of my 3 sons had a wonderful stay on board. Staff were extremely helpful and polite. My children were made to feel very welcome even with their extensive questioning and list of priorities of things to see whilst on the ship. Breakfast was delicious and plentiful there was even Nutella which my youngest was very happy about.,5,2014,09,04
119,Brilliant Experience,"Stayed on Sunborn for 2 nights, what a brilliant experience, so different from the usual London hotels. Sat out on deck on a sunny evening with a glass of wine... felt like I was on holiday. I would certainly return.",5,2014,09,04
119,Relaxing Stay at the Sunborn,We came to London for my 50th Birthday and had a very relaxing stay here. The room was large and the bed was one of the comfortable ones I have ever slept in. There was plenty of wardrobe space and an iron and board. The ensuite was also spacious and very clean with large fluffy towels. One minor gripe is that there were no robes in the room. We didn't try breakfast here as we were unsure what was on offer as it wasn't advertised in the room information.,5,2014,09,02
119,Lovely hotel experience,"Great hotel with lots of local amenities, bars and restaurants. We booked the King room and paid for wine, chocolates and roses on arrival since it was our anniversary! The hotel staff were amazing taking extra attention to detail. We mentioned it was our anniversary so they gave us a few discount vouchers for the bar and the restaurant.
The restaurant was brilliant with great food and views of Victoria dock. If you intend to cross the river or want to go out and eat, I would suggest the O2 and what better way to travel there than in the Emirates cable cart. This is a 5min walk from the hotel.
In all, this was a great hotel experience and couldn't find any fault.",5,2014,09,02
119,A life on the ocean wave,"Looks very impressive from the outside and no disappointment inside.
I had one of the cheapest rooms @ £140 per night, it was just above the water line.  There was a constant hum from the something at that level and you could hear the water occasionally splashing.
But the bed was so large and comfortable that a light sleeper like me had a good sleep.
The room was very large being nearly half the width of the ship and had a thin curtain dividing the bedroom area from the sofa/TV - so for the money in London it could not be beaten.
The menu looked expensive for what it was so I didn't try it. 
Reception staff friendly.
There is the shorted lift journey (n the world?) of about 2 foot going from street level to the lower floor!
Not a huge amount to do - though the cable cars - a 10 min walk away - and the O2 are essential.
Downsides - no UK shaving point, some sockets were a bit loose, my room card failed 3 out of 4 days - could have been due to being near my mobile but reception sorted it out quickly. No laundry facilities at that time. Not a great deal to do in the area and limited restaurants.",4,2014,09,02
119,Great place to stay for the O2 or Excel,"We had been waiting for the Sunborn to open and was very pleased it did, it is just as we had tickets to the O2. It is a short walk and an enjoyable trip on the cable car over to the O2, with another short walk on the other side !!!

The overall impression of the boat as you walk to it from the tube station is one of walking to a very expensive private yacht!! lovely entrance lobby, very helpful and friendly staff and simply outstanding rooms. The rooms are very large and obviously have a good view, although I think the dock view is slightly better that the 'land view'. 

We would both stay there in the blink of an eye, just loved it.",4,2014,09,01
119,Friendly and luxury,"We stayed at Sunborn in London for 3 nights and I find it was good relax to stay and breakfast excellent.
When we arrive by car and we are deaf and the staff was really good and very friendly, she come out and walk to barrier and show us where we should park the car and it was easy. Also there have blue badge car parks 
our room are very good size and look thought the little window, there are beauitful view to see and I can see there have 02 Dome and Emirate air cable car. TV have substitles too
there are excellent location because there have DRL, Emirate air cable 02 and ExCel building.
I will definitely come back again and I will highly recommend my friends about Sunborn Yacht",5,2014,09,01
119,"Friendly, luxurious and relaxing","We booked the sunborn for our first wedding anniversary and so glad that we did!

We were greeted at reception by Nazma who was incredibly helpful and friendly and immediately upgraded our room when we told her it was our anniversary. 

The hotel is very clean and the views over the Thames are gorgeous. 

The cocktails at the bar are delicious and the food in the restaurant at dinner was to die for. I recommend the full English breakfast too!!

Will definitely be coming back for a second visit!",5,2014,08,31
119,"Sunborn Yacht, London","I stayed on the Sunboard Yacht 16/17 August and had a fantastic stay.  The yacht is beautiful, staff very attentive, food excellent and the cabin very comfortable.  There is absolutely nothing that I can fault about this yacht and for the money is very good value.  I will definitely be booking again and would thoroughly recommend anyone to book a stay here.",5,2014,08,29
119,Friendly Helpful Staff - Excellent Stay,"I have stayed here a few times recently and have found the service and staff to be excellent. I left some things behind on my second stay - I only had to speak to one person and then had a call from the housekeeping manager who took care of everything. 

Its clean, quiet and currently everything is new. I particularly liked the in room coffee machine and sony tablet. 

My Evening meal and breakfast was served swiftly and with a fantastic view of the area. 

The Sunborn is my new hotel of choice when visiting the city; easy to get to, clean, quiet, but vibrant!",5,2014,08,29
119,Fantastic service and brilliant idea,"This is a unique and lovely idea for a different stay and created real excitement for our 2 children. There are the odd teething problems still - the spa is not open yet, our air con didn't work properly and our bill was not initially correct but we could not fault the efficient, thoughtful and helpful staff. The buffet breakfast is not cheap at 19.50 but kids eat free and there was a good range of choice for all of us with delicious smoked salmon and good quality meats. There are a good range of nice quiet restaurants in the area and it's right next to the Docklands Light Railway so good transport links in to central London. Also the Emirates Skyline over to the O2 is right on the quay. We would definitely stay again.",5,2014,08,28
119,Not your usual venue for drinks - brilliant!,"If you'd picture yourself on a yacht, it would most likely be on open waters or somewhere in the Caribbean. This one you will find in the middle of London's Docklands with its view on the Emirates Cable Cars and it has not lost of its beauty. 
It is an rather unusual find and definitely worth the journey into the Docklands. With its views towards Canary Wharf, it provides a picturesque backdrop for drinks on the upper deck.

I met friends there for a reunion and we stayed until late into the night. The drinks selection covered a range of wines  and one of London finest beers 'Meantime'. The food we ordered was presented well and very tasty. A mix of flavours and textures - my favourite was a Full English on thin slice of French baguette. Yum!",5,2014,08,28
119,Lovely,"Stayed overnight at the Sunborn London, it was lovely.  Staff couldnt do more for you, very attentive.  We did have to wait for our room but that was ok as they took our bags from us and left us free to go into the City as we wanted to see the Tower and the poppy's.  Came back and our bags were in our rooms.  

I would definitely pay to upgrade to waterside with a balcony, well worth the little bit extra.  We were on Deck 5 and we had glorious views, a lovely balcony and were blessed with the weather on the Saturday.  The room was very comfortable, bed and pillows were good quality.  Complimentary toiletries were Molton Brown, hairdryer was pretty good considering it was one of those bathroom ones.

We enjoyed a pre-dinner cocktail in the bar which had stunning views of the water and the 02.  Dinner in the restaurant was high quality but was let down by the bread (just normal white sliced bread with garlic butter), prices werent cheap but then you have to acknowledge where you are and I dont think it would have been any more expensive than other good quality hotel restaurant prices.  Great service.

Buffet breakfast had lots of choice and plenty of it.  Again service was second to none.

I'd recommend this unusual hotel and will definitely stay again",5,2014,08,27
119,Nice stay,Had a lovely one night stay here in July. The outside bit of the bar is great to have drinks at and the cocktails are so well made. The staff were really friendly and helpful. Would recommend staying here for one night. ,5,2014,08,26
119,top shelf night or 2 away,"just returned yesterday from 2 nights stay for my sisters 50th birthday, absolutely fabulous  much better than staying at a hotel and location excellent   for canary wharf 02 and even Covent garden .
Staff are so friendly and excellent  Nazma especially was lovely and look forward to seeing her when we return.
any occation you must go anyone will love it couples or groups 

cant wait to go back, thanks again to all the lovely staff.....",5,2014,08,26
119,Exceptional customer service!,"Our party of 6 stayed for one night as a 'girly' treat following an afternoon at the theatre.  The customer service really was second to none.  The General Manager and his team at were very professional, yet extremely warm and welcoming.  All staff went out of their way to speak with us to ensure we were enjoying our stay.  Also, many members of staff demonstrated a good sense of humour which helped us feel relaxed and enhanced our stay.  The rooms were really comfortable, spacious and clean.  The tablet facility within the rooms was a welcome surprise and something that we found particularly useful.  One member of our party required wheelchair access - her needs were very well catered for both in terms of the room and throughout the yacht.  We enjoyed an evening meal and breakfast on board the food was exquisite on both occasions.  Our table with a view of the City, during our evening meal, was probably the best view in London!  We travelled by car and parked just a few minutes walk from the yacht for £15 for 24hrs - in London, it doesn't get much cheaper.  Our girly trip to London was supposed to be about the theatre but because of its unique appeal, it turned into our stay on the yacht.  We had a wonderful time and cannot wait to return.",5,2014,08,25
119,Fabulous!,"We visited London for the Monte Python reunion at the 02. Excellent location for this, especially with the gondola thing to get there (shame it only runs till 9pm, but can't blame Sunborn for that). So we were there win the soft opening period. That said, it was nigh on perfect. Very enthusiastic and helpful staff, great room, very luxury.",5,2014,08,25
119,Exceeding expectation,"The customer service of this hotel is second to none everything is done by the team to ensure as a customer your aspirations are met. 
Thank you to the manager who was in reception on our arrival and there in the morning when we left.
There were a few small areas where I was initially disappointed the room I was initially given looked onto the dock but when I asked to be moved they accomodated and did everything to ensure that they put a smile on my face the coffee machine did not work but within five minutes it was replaced what can I say apart from visit yourself and you will see what I mean",5,2014,08,24
119,Floating destination restaurant,"If you fancy something different then try the Sunborn at Victoria Dock.  We celebrated a friend's birthday in the stunning restaurant and had a wonderful evening.
What makes this venue so special is the spacious outdoor terrace facing downriver to Canary Wharf.  Arriving on a sunlit evening in August the view is spellbounding.  As darkness fell, the lights of this exciting part of London spread across the entire vista and we all agreed this was a sight worth seeing.  The restaurant staff are expert, friendly and attentive.   The food is good - although even our ladies found that portions were a little sparse.  There are comfortable seating areas for you to have a quite chat before rejoining the merry throng if like we did, you are enjoying the evening with a large group (30).  In summary an excellent evening provided by team Sunborn, especially given that this floating Hotel (with one hundred and thirty five guest rooms over five floors) only opened in June 2014.",5,2014,08,24
119,Almost Perfect!,"This was an almost perfect stay. Firstly, all staff were amazing, friendly, helpful and cared about your stay. There are some negatives, so I'll do those first. When we got to our room the key swipe didn't work very well and took 14 swipes etc to get into the room! Even the maintenance men struggled. Once in the room we found our shower door broken and hanging off it's hinges. I would have thought rooms were inspected prior to using. However, very friendly maintenance men fixed shower but door remained an issue. During our stay there were many children. They were running up and down the corridors which really impacts your stay as you can really feel it in the room. They were also running up and down the main staircase that leads into the restaurant which is really annoying when you're trying to enjoy a meal in lovely surroundings. When the restaurant staff caught them, they did ask them to stop. I don't dislike children at all, but parents need to be encouraged to keep them under control. With dinner I wanted cheese and port but there was no port! These 2 go together and should be available likewise no brown sauce for the cooked breakfast! Just ketchup and mayo! After dinner we went to the bar but a group of people celebrating a birthday took over the atmosphere and were really loud and started singing their own songs. Bar music was stopped so it was a case of listening to them or going to our room which we did! Positives, wonderful staff in all areas, beautiful room, gorgeous food, fantastic surroundings. On check out we discussed through our concerns and the manager came to see us. This was great as he seemed very keen to put right some of our concerns for future stays. Although negatives seem more of an issue in this review, see through them as we really enjoyed our stay.    ",4,2014,08,23
119,Pure Luxury,"Loved staying on ""the yacht"".  A little bit of luxury just a train journey from the centre of London. Breakfast was awesome.  We stayed on the previous Sunborne before she went off to be refitted and she is now further down the river so the parking is little bit more cumbersome that previous.  But the whole experience is delightful.",5,2014,08,22
119,Amazing experience,"As someone who has been fortunate to travel quite extensively and stay in some pretty amazing hotels, along with some stinkers, I feel qualified to give a well rounded review.

There was nothing about the hotel that was not perfection! From the extremely attentive staff to the wonderful staircase in Reception it is hard not to be impressed. From the moment I arrived to the moment I left I was made to feel no only a valued customer but one of the family.

The rooms are spacious and very well decorated with luxury there for all to see. It has excellent WiFi reception and even has a tablet in the room, a nice touch. The bed was extremely comfortable and that comes from someone who is very fussy when it comes to my sleep.

Take the opportunity on an evening to sit out on the deck and take in the views of Canary Wharf in the distance. At night, when all lit up it offers a very different take on London and one that not many have the opportunity to appreciate.

If you are in London and fancy a change from the normal stuffy Hotel rooms give Sunborn Yacht a shot, you will not be disappointed.",5,2014,08,22
119,"Stunning hotel, lovely staff amazing","This is the first time i have ever commented on trip advisor for a review. I just had to give a review as I was so happy with our stay.

I stayed at the hotel on 20.08.2014 for my 1st anniversary and had such a lovely experience. The location is perfect right on DLR and short walk to Royal Victoria to get Emirates Flight Cable to O2. 

The staff at the hotel was the friendliest staff I have ever met at a hotel from the moment I walked in to the minute I left. The staff all made our stay extra special in each way. 

The rooms had free wifi with a free tablet to use which was really cool and handy.

We was upgraded to the executive room view of the Thames. I had a personal letter delivered from the Manager was such an extra personal touch and the 50% voucher off drinks.

The hotel was absolutely stunning our room was very nice, lovely and spacious. We really had a good time.",5,2014,08,22
119,Food nice service dire,"Booked the restaurant 2 weeks ago online, after waiting 2 days still no confirmation so I rang reception and booked a table for 2 by the window. Once we arrived, (no parking space for this hotel/restaurant, would have been nice to know), we made our way to the restaurant where we found the front desk. I was speaking to a gentlman first of all who took our name then walked off, another lady confirmed my name and resevation and ask2d where we would liked to be sat I explained I had requested a window seat, all window seats are for 4 ( must have been an inconvenience for them to remove 2 place settings). Ordered a bottle of red wine, whilst the waitress was pouring it drips all around BOTH glasses (really) are we in a major london restaurant or mcdonalds (this is not a cheap meal). Asked for jug of still water, got a bottle for £5 truely didnt 
realise tap water in Britain was bad for you. Food was nice and presented on the plates worthy of a London hotel and restaurant, but how we were presented with them, I may has well been back in the military (20 yrs ago). I cannot even put it down to being busy, 6 people in the restaurant. The service and professionalism was dire and im not a cheap skate but at £130 for 2 people I think you deserve good service, and a 12% service charge was added.",2,2014,08,22
119,"Excellent hotel, fabulous staff","Stayed here with my husband and two young children.  Room was lovely, staff were so friendly and at breakfast there was a small play area for the children, with colouring books, train set, disney stories...a small touch, but greatly appreciated when the children finished their breakfast before us me needed entertaining.
Breakfast was delicious, fresh and plentiful.
Can't fault this hotel at all!!!",5,2014,08,21
119,WOW !!!! Best Dining Experience,"Discovered this on the Web and had to go and experience it for myself.  I tried to call them on several occasions  but no response but I stayed up that night until  2am got through to them and made enquiries and to my delight they said I could come along the next day.

The nearest station is Custom House DLR but you can get off at Royal Victoria station.  We walked across the bridge and right in front your eyes this £150 million pound Yacht was just a magical find, all I can say is wow. If you can afford please go along.

I was so excited, as it was so beautiful and luxurious from the moment you stepped on the deck to walking through the doors, I felt like I was so important and in another country.

Gold staircase, gold lifts, gold tables it was just perfect. We went out on the deck and had a few drinks then went into the Restaurant for our meal. The staff where very nice and genuine and the food was excellent, it was expensive but class and luxury has a price tag........

This was just PERFECT",5,2014,08,20
119,Excellent service & unique venue,"A floating 'super yacht' hotel with a high quality fit out, attentive service & great location right beside the Excel centre in Docklands - brilliant idea. I was flying from City airport and decided to give this hotel a try instead of the limited budget hotel options I'm usually have to settle for - & I'm very glad I did. I will be a regular here from now on.....",5,2014,08,20
119,A great find- luxurious,"First impressions of the yacht are fabulous.  As you walk towards it from the DLR station, it looks really stunning. You enter via a lift and walk into a fabulous reception area.  The reception staff couldn't have been more helpful and check-in was nice and quick.  Our room was overlooking the docks and was spacious with all of the facilities that you would expect.  We had a balcony, although small, which had a couple of chairs on it.  There were bathrobes and Moulton Brown toiletries.  The bathroom was fairly compact with just a shower- no bath. We didn't eat there as the menu looked fairly pricey, but we had drinks in the bar.  Again, the staff were efficient and friendly.  We would definitely stay here again.",4,2014,08,19
119,Fabulous experience and right on your doorstep,"Just stayed on the Sunborn for a night and had the best experience.  The room/cabin was fabulous with lots of lovely little touches, a voile seperating the sleeping area from the sitting area, only a small thing but was lovely, the posh coffee machine for coffee snobs was perfect.
The food was top class and the service was faultless.  
So close to some great attractions had my first trip on the cable cars which was great.
I can't recommend this highly enough, so much so I have booked again!",5,2014,08,19
119,Birthday meal at the Sunborn.,"I don't think I've ever given a restaurant a 10/10 review, but this is it!!

The welcome, the food, the wine, the service and the setting - all excellent. 

Every element of our first course was cooked to perfection. I chose a chocolate pudding for dessert which our waitress told us would take 12 minutes as it was prepared to order. It was worth the wait and with that view waiting was not a hardship.

Just go - you won't regret it!",5,2014,08,18
119,Best yet fantastic,Passing by the The nearby emerates cable car we arrived a minute later and both said wow at the same time we just knew then and there our weekend was going to be fabulous but when we entered even our expectations were far surpassed the interior was luxury personified the staff were so warm and friendly we entered the room and was surprised how large it was going to many hotels our double would have been classed a suite in any other London hotel pop went the champagne as we knew we had found a gem our room had sumptuous double bed beautiful distressed leather luxury settee large screen TV and lots of other nice touches and useful items my favourite was the coffee machine which was restocked with coffee when requested I drink a lot we took our champagne to our ample balcony (dockside but we didn't care) this was great the weather was hot we felt abroad overlooking the exec centre we noticed a few restaurants we never needed to visit the food was great on board and cocktails on the stern outdoor seated deck all made up to one of the best weekends we have ever had a must for anyone even the newly refurbished yacht not having its spa or room service up and running yet didn't detract from our now favourite hotel,5,2014,08,18
119,Docklands Delight,"We have just stayed on the Sunborn for three nights.
The rooms/cabins are lovely, ours was river side with a balcony.  From where we had great views of  the O2 and Canary Wharf. 
Beautifully fitted out large room with a comfy bed, sofa, coffee table and coffee and tea facilities.  The bathroom had a large walk in shower with Molton Brown toiletries. 
Great buffet breakfast offering fruit, cold meats, delicious pastries and a nice cooked breakfast too.  All the staff we encountered were helpful and friendly.
It's a short walk to the Emirates Airline cable car which takes you across to the O2. From the cable car you get  fabulous views of the Thames flood barrier and the docklands.  
It's just a short walk to the DLR to gain access to the city.
You can't drive up to the Yacht but parking is available either at the Excel or Royal Victoria both just a short walk away, and only £15 a day, which is cheap for London.
Overall a great hotel which I thoroughly recommend.",4,2014,08,17
119,Luxury on board the yacht,"As part of a GB tours weekend in London, we stayed on the drop-dead gorgeous yacht, Sunborn.  Fantastic cabin/rooms, wonderful coffee maker, molton brown toiletries.  Moored in Royal Victoria Dock with views of the 02 arena, it is a great base for touring.  Afternoon tea at £26 was off limits for us, but we did dine on board - pricey but we were on holiday!  Beautiful food, and the only downside was a very long wait for a black coffee and a cappuccino resulted in the cappuccino being stone cold.  However, it was quickly deducted from the bill, but disappointing.  Otherwise everything was great, with a delicious help-yourself buffet breakfast the next morning.  Pity it was only for one night!  Would love to go again.",4,2014,08,17
119,A great place for a celebratory break!,Just got home after a lovely Anniversary weekend away at the Sunborn. My husband and I enjoyed our stay and will be going back to celebrate with our daughter for her 18th Birthday in October. The staff were very helpful and friendly.  The rooms are of an excellent size. The location is superb;  we stay in London for celebrations a few times a year and if you want something a little more quirky and to make a real change from your typical hotel stay away in London. Stay on the Sunborn!,5,2014,08,17
119,1 Night stay,"Arrived too early for our  room however, very friendly reception staff took charge of our luggage whilst we enioyed a light lunch and drink in the bar.  Within a short space they called us to say room was ready.  
Lovely  on 5th floor with  balcony overloking the river. Beautifully presented, clean and inviting.
Went over to 02 on cable car and on return had cocktail in the bar. We then retired to our room and watched the planes and enjoyed the whole Ambience from our balcony, having drinks and nibbles.
great  nights sleep and enjoyed a late leisurely breakfast, with plenty of it before our departure.
Would come again if deal prices stay the same but as itmis currently on soft  opening, prices  will go up as spa and other things are still to open..
All staff were friendly, informative, smart and attentive. 
Thoroughly enjoyable night away.
Best accessed from Custom House DLR station, only short  walk past EXCEL",5,2014,08,17
119,Just fabulous,"Arrived at 10.30 to drop off bags , but our room was ready so we was allowed in , how good is that, fantastic room over looking river, clean , large , just wonderful , and the staff so friendly , and helpful, had evening meal on board , perfect, and breakfast was so much choice , it was hard to choose, it was that good have already booked to take husband this time , see you on the 6/9 /14. T",5,2014,08,17
119,"Go on, spoil yourself!","This one-night experience was amazing! Few places really understand how important good customer service really is to making a stay memorable.  The Sunborn and its team certainly do. Greeted with smiles it would be impossible to fault any member of staff from reception, to bar, restaurant, people you just bumped into along the spacious corridors, all clearly enjoy working on this luxury boat.  Food to die for, reasonably priced, unless you go for the top of the range choices, served in a splendid atmosphere. Spacious cabin, king sized bed, with all mod cons, even your own coffee making machine. Thank you Sunborn; worth every penny! Will return!",5,2014,08,17
119,Fabulous,"My husband and I have just returned from a 3 night trip in London and booked to go on the Sunborn, London and what a fabulous experience.  The room was immaculate, the staff were very helpful and friendly and the food was amazing.  Was with in easy walking distance of the DLR railway to get in to the centre of London and the cable car to get to O2 arena.  Would definitely book to go back on the Sunborn again - amazing. 

Mrs Fenton, Newcastle upon Tyne",5,2014,08,16
119,Wow - what amazing value?????,We stayed here as a treat as we were doing the London Prudential 100 Mile bike ride and it was so amazing.   We checked in the day before and the staff couldnt be more helpful.  They carried our bikes to the room and everyone was so nice and pleasant.  The place was clean and tidy and in the bed I felt like a small child with the biggest quilt ever and snuggled up like a baby.  It was a shame to get up at 4.30am !!!,5,2014,08,15
119,Fantastic little hidden gem,"Stayed here for 1 night to attend a party in Stratford. 
Do not have a single moan whatsoever! From the moment we arrived to when we left we were treated like royalty. The guy at the entrance helped us with our bags & guided us to reception, where we were immediately offered a most welcome glass of chilled prosecco. Check in was swift & efficient. And our room was lovely, the carpet was so plush & you sank into it. Didn't eat diner but breakfast was amazing & the best black pudding I have ever eaten! Plenty of bread & pastries & cereal,juice, yoghurts & locally sourced full English breakfast, we were very full! Would definitely stay again just hope the prices don't rocket too much as I believe it's in the trial stages with the public at present? Well done to all the staff on the sunborn you are a credit to the hotel & keep up the good work! ",5,2014,08,14
119,What a great idea,"Take a nice yacht and turn it into a luxury hotel! Stayed here over the week-end and was very impressed. Good location the only drawback being the lack of parking but with the Excel right next door 24 hours for £15 set charge it's not to bad for London.  Easy to get to the O2 via the cable cars or into London via the DLR. Bit short on good restaurants and would not recommend the Indian opposite! Back to the hotel rooms very nice bathroom a little small but overall very impressed, excellent breakfast served on the fourth floor. But the bar is very pricey top tip walk to the bar and order your drinks as we sat on the closet table approx 2m from bar and got charged £5.50 service charge!.  But overall recommended.",5,2014,08,14
119,Sunborn for a Surprise 60th,"Thank you to the team at the Sunborn that made my Mother in law's Surprise 60th so special.  The Sunborn were very accommodating to our special requests and the rooms and setting is very unique.  The rooms are of a good size and have very comfortable beds.  It is close to the London City Airport so you can expect some noise during the day from the aeroplanes but good fun watching them fly past.  Breakfast the next morning was a good choice and had a wide selection of buffet items to choose from.  Location wise it is next to the ExCel centre and the emirates cable cars so it is easy to get that across and then hop on a river boat to get into Central London.

We so much enjoyed our stay we are coming back again!",5,2014,08,14
119,Find an excuse to spoil yourself,"I wanted to treat a dear friend to lunch and came across the Sunborn by accident. So very pleased I did as it was such a different and quality experience. Staff were very attentive and food was sumptious. Location is most appealing (on a sunny day!) and we were made to feel very special people. 

So glad we founfd it.",5,2014,08,13
119,Weekend Break,"My Wife and I have been wanting to do the tourist thing and go on a open top bus and see the sites , although we have been to London before , it was always to visit friends or realtives , we looked for some where special to stay , and our luck was in 
The Sunborn Yacht offers every thing you could want from a quality hotel , plus the extra of being afloat, it was a fantastic weekend and many thanks to the staff on board and the amazing accomadation , sorry forgot the great evening meal on board great steak , this will be a memorable visit for us for some time , I would highly recomend this Hotel with a big difference",5,2014,08,13
119,Amazing,"I have just returned home from staying over night here last night all I can say is you must give this beautiful hotel a try... We showed up yesterday at 10am and even though check in not till 3pm was informed that could leave our cases so we could enjoy our day round London, when we returned at 7pm to check in I was greeted straight away by very polite staff who was very welcoming!!  When I have our names to check the receptionist informed me that as it was our anniversary they had a suprise for us to which they had ungraded out room from a basic to a executive room for free of charge... We was waterside view and a balcony.. Couldn't believe our luck and was informed 2 weeks prior it was an extra 80 pound to get that room.... When we entered our room I was so happy to see a anniversary card and a plate of chocolates with happy anniversary wrote across I thought what an amazing wonderful gesture!! The room was so clean, the carpet thick, the bedding gorgeous and the sofa and tv section amazing!! Our view was wonderful too!! So thank you so much sunborn for a very memorable stay and cannot wait till we return to stay again as this will for sure be the place I will stay everytime I visit London now... Mr and mrs bray",5,2014,08,12
119,Most impressive,"This hotel certainly has the wow factor. The ship is moored beside the ExCel centre so it is convenient for the DLR, Emirates Airline cable car and City Airport. The cabins are well-appointed with shiny wooden floors and comfy beds, Molton Brown toiletries in the bathroom and a fridge with sufficient space to put your own drinks in.

The food and drink prices are a little steep but then it is a brand new and unique London hotel. If you are worried about the ship rocking on the waves there’s no need to as it is fixed to the quayside with massive metal supports. Aircraft noise might cause some annoyance but if you like watching take-off and landings then you get a great view of the planes approaching and leaving LCY from the footbridge over the Royal Docks.",5,2014,08,11
119,Something different...,"We stayed for 2 days on the Sunborn and really enjoyed it.  There are comments on the beige decor but it's hard to style a room in a neutral enough shade to suit all palates.  If you want vibrant decor, try the Malmaison.  The rooms are a great size with everything you need, including a coffee machine (biscuits would have been nice lol) and a tablet which was great for us to find information out and plan routes. The bed was comfortable & the bathroom was brightly lit (my pet hate is dark bathrooms). 
I was concerned about the location, never having stayed outside the centre of London but it was great.  So many eating places yet still quite and the DLR was great to get around. 
We did have an issue where the aircon was broken and we asked for it to be fixed in the morning.  When we returned late at night, it wasn't fixed and 27 degrees in the room.  However, anything can break down but a way to judge a hotel/customer service is how a complaint is resolved.  The Duty Manager found us a room immediately across from ours and held the doors open and helping us move our things across.  In the morning, our car park was paid for as a gesture of goodwill.
So, in a nutshell, would I stay again.....yes.  But I hope Sunborn don't use the novelty factor to outprice themselves.",4,2014,08,11
119,Memorable visit,"Thoroughly enjoyed our visit to London  last weekend and our stay on Sunborn.   We felt it was an easy location, just a few stops on the DLR from Tower Gateway to Customs House (nearest stop) then follow signs to Excell.  First sight of the yacht is impressive!  All the staff we met were friendly, polite and very efficient. Our room was HUGE and overlooked the water; bathroom had lovely Molton Brown products - always a welcome treat!   (I had to smile at breakfast next morning when I heard a chap, yes a chap, tell his wife how much he loved the thick white towels and bedlinen!)
As it was such a lovely sunny evening we dined on deck - just a light supper (Charcuterie board, delicious).  We had planned to 'just have a very light breakfast' but one look at the tempting breakfast spread, and our will-power failed.  Husband decided to walk off the calories after breakfast and strolled along to the Emirates Sky Ride, (Cable Cars) just a short distance from Sunborn. He took the 'round trip' over to Greenwich and back and of course the views were wonderful.

We met up with Australian relatives for lunch on board Sunborn and enjoyed beautiful sea Bass in a fennel sauce -highly recommended.  Did we bother with pudding?  er, yes, afraid so.
Lunch was pricey - two courses plus wine and water for four people, approx £145 (but I guess London prices always seem high to West Country bumpkins and it was high quality produce, service and location after all - so no complaints).

Only slight problem we encountered during our stay was the air conditioning - very noisy during the night and unable to regulate it due to broken thermostat.   I felt this was just a problem with our particular room (Room 111) and we reported it to Reception.  Overall this was one of the best hotels we had stayed in, certainly in London, and would definitely book again.",5,2014,08,11
119,Special Treat,"An impressive sight when you walk from Custom House to the entrance.

Was greeted by friendly staff at the reception and check in was very swift.
Executive suite was spacious , comfortable and very clean too. Bathroom had lovely thick bath sheets and a nice arrangement of Molton Brown toiletries.

I didn't eat in the restaurant but did have breakfast which was a disappointment. Sauté potatoes were cold as were the mushrooms. I had to ask twice for tea but it wasn't going to let that spoil my weekend.

Hope to return again and will recommend.
 ",5,2014,08,10
119,A thoroughly delightful stay. Shame we had to go home.,"We booked this to celebrate our 10th Wedding Anniversary. WOW, what a lovely weekend we had. Blown away by the yacht - totally ab fab. Staff really helpful and friendly, although check in was a bit slow. Lovely room, exceeded our expectations. We chose to dine in the restaurant, although it was quite pricey, as it was a special occasion we decided to go with the flow. Waiting staff were very attentive and the food really hit the spot. Lovely to sit in the restaurant and dine without noisy kids being present (don't do noisy kids). Felt perhaps a dress code might be appropriate in the restaurant. Not sure shorts and deck shoes appropriate for the calibre of restaurant. Breakfast was excellent, plenty of choice (loved the chocolate bread!!), mind you the bacon, eggs and sausages were pretty good as well.",5,2014,08,10
119,Nice couple of days!!,"What a great hotel. A very clever idea to convert a yacht of this size.

The yacht is amazing in every way.
Our room was excellent, nice location and views, staff were superb.
Even the surrounding area is clean and nice to stroll around.
Overall it was excellent. Highly recommended.
",5,2014,08,10
119,Loved it!,"We wanted a sight seeing holiday in London for our family (2adults, 2children) and wanted something a little different. The Sunborn certainly delivered on that! 

As soon as we spotted it at the dock we couldn't believe our luck. It looks fantastic from the outside and is just as nice inside. 
Check in was quick and easy. We had booked an exec family room with balcony and were luck enough to be on the water side with great views of the O2, canary wharf etc. Room was a good size; plenty of space even with sofa bed out and cot bed up. Our beds were comfortable, the carpet was luxuriously thick and the bathroom whilst being small had everything we needed and was of a high standard. The Sony tablet giving free Internet connection was a nice touch. 

We found getting into central London easy, even with a pram. It's a very short walk to the DLR at excel, where you change for the tube at canning town. After a busy day in the city centre it was actually really nice to escape the crowds and return to the fresh air and open spaces that the docklands area offers. In fact, we spent our first day exploring this area rather than heading in to central London as there was plenty to do and places to eat including a little beach area close to the cable car which was really nice, friendly and not over crowded.

Parking at the excel seemed safe enough and was £15 for 24 hrs. It is very close to the boat (a much shorter walk than we expected). 

All in all we were sad to leave. The Sunborn is a wonderful hotel and the bar terrace area in the sunshine was fantastic! You felt like rotalty! 

We will certainly look to return when we visit London again, especially if we can benefit from the 3 for 2 night offer which we did this time. 

Only negative... Breakfast was quoted at £19 each (I wasn't offered a price for a child so assume they are charged full?), which is far too expensive for 3 people for 3 mornings, especially with a child who would only eat a bowl of cereal. However, we found some nice cafes near by offering breakfast for a more reasonable price (£3.95 for full english) and we actually prefered having a walk in the morning sunshine.

If you want a luxurious bolthole out of the city but close enough to the tube I would 100% recommend the Sunborn. Book it! ",5,2014,08,08
119,A lovely surprise,"We stayed for two nights on the Sunborn
What a lovely surprise.From first stepping on board to leaving everything was excellent.
The staff went out of there way to be friendly and helpfull.
The Room was excellent with everything you needed in it
We ate in the dining room which was very good.",5,2014,08,06
119,Sightseeing in London,"Excellent value for money, wonderful and friendly staff and would highly recommend it. The only quibble (which is very minor!) would be £10 for a cockail is a bit high but when in London expect London prices.

My partner and I definitely plan on going back there and have bored friends to tears about it already. It's unique, luxurious and a truly wonderful experience.",5,2014,08,06
119,Wedding night on the Sunborn,"The stay on the Sunborn was fantastic with stapp been very friendly and very helpful.
The room we stayed in was an executive suite with a balcony. The view over to the London Dome was great and the room it's self was supurb with a tablet supplied for access for various access to services and the web. The room as a whole was to a very high standard.

We turned up very late (after midnight) and was assisted by the staff in getting a pizza delivered to the ship to saitisfy out hunger which was a nice touch. Sitting on the balcony enjoying this while looking at the view was brilliant.

The staff went out of there way to make it a special night with petals in the shape of heart on our bed and a welcome card.

After a good nights sleep we then enjoyed one of the best breakfeast possible with a massive selection of really nice food.

We would recommend this to any one wanting a stay in London and likes a supurb a service.

You can't see the ship from the access road if arriving by car but it's a very shoft walk to the entry once there.",5,2014,08,06
119,Because we're worth it!,"Stayed for 'one night only' for a cheery up treat: slightly extravagant , but well worth it. Great service, friendly staff, spotlessly clean room. Breakfast not included in price, but it seemed a shame not to indulge- glad we did ' cos it was lovely! Would recommend for special occasion, specially if going to O2 or Canary Wharf. Nice to sit overlooking river with a drink, so get a river facing room with balcony. Would like to go again- it brightens up Custom House no end !",5,2014,08,05
119,A very welcome surprise!,"I stayed at the Sunborn in June 2014 to attend a conference at London Excel and I was very pleasantly surprised with my stay! 

First off, if you're going to attend a conference/exhibition then the location is perfect as the ship docks right next to the west entrance of the exhibition center. The service was fantastic, the rooms are very spacious which is not something you find often in London, very clean, very welcoming and a very good breakfast as well! 

I had a bit of an issue with the AC (again not always available in London) when I first checked in but the reception desk were great they first sent me a fan then relocated me to a room with a balcony. 

It is far from the touristic end of London, but if you are here for business or would like to be away from the hustle and bustle then it's a great experience.",4,2014,08,05
119,"Beautiful yacht, great service, but a bit far from the city centre","We stayed for two nights and we loved it. As it was a special event, the staff upgraded our room and we had a luxurious suite, with a balcony, so I cant fault the rooms in any way. The yacht is beautiful, the staff are really warm and friendly and we loved it. The only downside is that it is quite a journey from the centre, and at night the DLR rail station where the yacht is located is a little unsettling. We arrived back to find drunken Russians looking for an argument the first night and more drunken Russians falling about the station on the second night, so clearly there is a rowdy elememt in that part of the city. They were not looking for trouble from us, and I am sure nothing would have happened, but the station was so far out, down by the docks and quite eerie, so it was unsettling nevertheless.
That said, I would definitely book there again, as the yacht was worth it. ",5,2014,08,04
119,Unique experience,"Having looked at lots of hotels for a two night break away we were amazed to find this one available at a very reasonable price. We realised later this was due to it being in the soft opening phase and we couldn't have asked for better. We arrived late in the evening to friendly staff, shown to our room which was stunning, with a balcony overlooking the water . we had an executive suite for three adults and one child. one double bed and sofa bed. We only had two towels left for us and although the master quilt was large the quilt for the sofa bed was quite small , we asked for extra towels in the morning and they were put in the room and without asking for  an extra quilt for the sofa bed an extra one was left on the sofa bed when we returned that afternoon  so we were more than happy. All in all a stunning, exciting concept in a wonderful location with a nice atmosphere.",5,2014,08,04
119,5 star experience,"Nothing but positives to say for this hotel. Location good, service good and room was fantastic especially with a river view.

I look forward to staying there again for longer as it is a perfect place to use for base to explore London given it's location.

Possibility the most comfortable nights sleep I have had for a long time. ",5,2014,08,03
119,So disappointing,"The Sunborn promised so much, but from the outset it undelivered. The hotel is a ship - supposedly 4-star, with a cheap plastic canopy above the entrance.
The front of house guys were arrogant and totally disinterested - they couldn't be bothered to answer my questions. The bar was completely empty, I waited for 20 minutes for the barman to arrive - they had no beer.
The place is noisy - imagine a metal hull with paper-thin walls. The noise just appears to echo, echo.
There is no spa, no business centre, no gym, no security, no atmosphere ... Etc. and many things don't work properly. Also, it's right next to the airport - planes pass the window constantly.
Sunborn - so disappointing.",2,2014,08,03
119,Perfect,"Lovely place to stay. Fantastic service, especially from Ian platt. Didn't really know what to expect from my stay but me and the girlfriend have really enjoyed it. Definitely recommend and will definitely be staying here again sometime in the future! ",5,2014,08,03
119,Take Your Own Drinks,"Although this is a nice setting and very nice hotel, the prices of drinks was a rip off.
No draft beers a bottle of 330ml beer was £5. The staff were pushy and didn't talk to each other. I was pushed out on to the deck without being asked if I wanted to sit inside or outside .
As I was a regular when the Sunborn was last docked in Royal Docks some 4 years ago I was very upset at the decline in customer service and prices.
You get better views and service at the Upper Deck Bar at the nearby Novtel Hotel and the beer is cheaper.",1,2014,08,03
119,"Not finished yet, so a waste of money.","I stayed here in June 2014 due to its close proximity to the O2 arena. I was looking forward to the stay after reading the reviews, however the hotel is not fully finished. We tried to order room service however there was none available, (they couldn't get us any food at all even crisps from the bar) even though there was a menu with prices on the touch screen device provided.We had to order a takeaway ourselves and collect it from outside the hotel. There were numerous things that weren't available yet such as the spa facilities. We had an issue with one of the doors not opening on to our corridor so had to wait 20 minutes and ask reception numerous times to locate the master key to get us onto the corridor. 
Even though these are negatives, they were very helpful when I had accidentally left my earrings in the hotel room and they posted them free of charge. The hotel suite was an experience in itself, romantic and very clean and there was stunning views from the bar on the deck. When everything is up and running I'm sure it will be a excellent hotel, however for now, over priced for unfinished hotel.",3,2014,08,02
119,A great alternative to a standard hotel...,"We visited this in late July, it wasn't fully open and you you get the feeling that they are still ironing out some cracks...

Attention to detail isn't great, they got our name wrong multiple times and thought it was our anniversary and not my wife's birthday.

But I wouldn't let that stop me staying there again, or recommending it to others.  Access is simple via DLR and would be great if you are at Excel, or central London - it's only 20 mins from Tower Gate.

Staff we're friendly and helpful.

Restaurant had a basic menu but the food was very good, not cheap (£100 for two for dinner including wine) but was above average for quality. Auto-adding a service charge I thought was rude and not necessary in a hotel but it is ""optional""!!",5,2014,08,01
119,A Future Hotel with a Difference,"I have just returned after spending two nights and I an pleased that I have found a Hotel with a difference, The atmosphere is wonderful, partly due to the staff and partly the decor and although they have not yet had the official opening. They have one or two teething problems, but are in the throws of ironing them out. It takes time with a new adventure, but issues were addressed in a staff meeting in the mornings. A Hotel that will listen to the clients and are not proud enough to admit failure is the Hotel of the future with a difference and can only  strongly recommend it to others.
I feel sorry for the lady who was thirty weeks pregnant, but my experience of pregnant women in Hot Weather do not go well together,  all I can say you looked very stunning enjoying a drink on the open rear deck and congratulations.",5,2014,07,31
119,Looking good but service needs an upgrade!,"I stayed here with my wife as a belated anniversary break. The hotel is visualy very impressive and the rooms were very spacious and comfortable. Unfortunately our stay was let down by the service we received. We had dinner at the Lands End restaurant where the food was a little disappointing for the price. We then went down to the bar following our meal. We ordered a couple of bottles of wine but had to charge the drinks to our room as the card machine wasn't working. When it came to checkout we had a service charge added to every drink we had. We pre ordered breakfast at check in where the receptionist offered us a special price. When we went down to breakfast the lady on the desk seemed incredibly flustered and couldn't find our booking. When she eventually found it she asked me to return to our room and get the sleeve in which we received our room key, which I found rather odd and inconvenient. When it came to checkout we had to queue for 20 mins and were charged before seeing a bill. when I finally walked away from reception I inspected the bill to find that we had been charged twice for breakfast, once at the discount price and once at the full price. I then had to queue again in order to get the charge rectified. Instead of refunding the difference to my account they refunded the total balance and took the full revised payment (I now have to wait 5 days for the refund in my account). Beautiful hotel but I wouldn't stay here again due to the poor service.",2,2014,07,31
119,"Serious Security Issues and Poor Customer Service ... However, Very Fancy!","Arrived at the Sunborn Hotel after a long journey, on the hottest day of the year, 30 weeks pregnant, and I admit it, looking slightly scruffy (clothes creased after a train journey, and slightly red in the face). However, I didn't expect that this would affect the treatment we received.
To expand, we weren't offered a drink on arrival, and yet others appeared to be offered a complimentary juice, wine or water. We then were given the keys and room number. We were not given directions to the room, nor a map / explanation of the facilities on offer. We walked off in the wrong direction, pregnant and struggling with bags. After realising our error, we walked back through reception, and still no help offered. 
Opening the door to the room, we immediately noticed a problem - somebody else's belongings were already in the room! We didn't hang around long enough to suss out if this meant someone else was in the room, or that the room had not been cleaned. Either way, this is not right. This meant another trek back to reception. 
The receptionist looked flustered, quickly apologised, and offered us a room upgrade to a river-view suite in a way of an apology. We happily accepted, however she needed to check with management first. After management had looked us up and down (and as previously noted, we weren't looking our best!) she clearly decided we weren't of the calibre to be offered such a room, and downgraded us from our previous offer of an upgrade, to a marginal upgrade (and I mean a marginal upgrade - the room was worth £20 a night more. No river view) We had to accept that this was it. Again, we struggled to our room with our bags. Waddling away at 30 weeks pregnant. No offer of help.
The room was located next door to a room with a noisy hen party occupying it. I am not a party pooper - however I make the point that they were shouting random passers-by, and inviting them in for a free drink at reception (we didn't even get offered this!) and inviting them back to their rooms (at 5pm). Despite these random people travelling by hired city-bike, ""security"" were only too happy to let them in, and then we heard them partying away on the balcony, drinking with the hen party!
Just to add to the moan - lift broken, stain on bed, hole in black out curtains, no map of facilities in room and although there was complimentary coffee, hot chocolate and earl grey in the room, there was no normal breakfast tea. Surely complimentary morning tea is the basics of service??
A positive, was that the hotel was very fancy and the room very clean. But that is where my praise stops. Oh, and once we changed into our evening attire, the attitude of the staff did change and we were treated much better - they offered to take a photo for us!! (Too little, too late??)",3,2014,07,28
119,Absolutely Fantastic,"First time staying here, looks lovely in the photos and its just as good when you stay there. We received a warm welcome and a glass of prosecco on arrival and it was all up hill from there onwards. The staff are the friendliest, professional and most accommodating I have ever come across. We had an executive room which is immaculately clean, spacious and has a bed and pillows so comfortable you don't want to leave. Great view from the balcony in the room and tea, coffee are provided free of charge with a mini bar for water and a selection of drinks. Check in and check out are a painless procedure with extremely polite staff. We had a few drinks on the deck with great views of the dome, Canary Wharf and the City in the distance. There re good bars and restaurants in the local vicinity if you don't want to eat on board. We stayed on a Saturday night and if you're looking for a hotel with a difference this is the place to stay.",5,2014,07,28
119,Couldn't imagine a better weekend...,"WOW! We entered Sunborn and we said WOW! We couldn't stop looking around when we were offered a welcome drink while the friendliest receptionist ever checked us in. Check in was very smooth, pleasant and the lady made us very welcome. 

Our room was very spacious, loved the porthole window as it gave me the boat feeling. 
We had plans to go out with friends so didn;t stay for dinner although we should have after looking at the menu.

Slept like babies, very comfortable bed, and headed to breakfast. Food was well cooked and delicious and the waiters were all very nice.

Check out was again very smooth, reception staff very efficient. You get the feeling that the staff really enjoy working there and I don't blame them.

Will definitely be back on my next London visit. 

Thank you Sunborn for an amazing weekend. See you soon.",5,2014,07,27
119,Anyone going to the O2 should think about staying here!,"Even if you’re not going to the O2 it’s a new and exciting venue. 
I recently went with my family to this lovely boat hotel in the East of London. It was intended as an end of term treat for the children but we loved it too. 
We had a suite which had two rooms - one double bedroom as well as a living room with a sofa bed where the children slept very well. In addition there was an enormous bathroom complete with a sauna and Molton Brown toiletries. I think anyone staying here has to think about the suite option as it really gives the stay that extra something.  The children were thrilled and so were we. The accommodation was so spacious that it was easy for us to share as a family without anyone getting on top of anyone else. We also had a massive private terrace overlooking the docks. This is a must and gives a great view of Docklands – wonderful at night.
Inventive cocktails and a sunset followed by a lovely dinner in the restaurant rounded off our evening perfectly. Very romantic, even with the children. 
After a good night’s sleep we took the Emirates cable car (a 5 minute walk) and went to the Emirates museum where the children had lots of fun. We then went over to the O2 arena itself – very easy to get to - and had a little walk around. 
Great value and wonderful experience.",5,2014,07,27
119,A memorable family experience,"A fantastic treat for the family...combined with a trip on the cable car and the Clipper, my daughters (10 & 7) had a really great weekend.  The yacht hotel was a very special place to stay.  All the staff were excellent, extremely friendly and helpful.  Everywhere was spotlessly clean and both dinner and breakfast were delicious. I wouldn't hesitate to recommend Sunborn London if you want somewhere unique and special to stay in London.",5,2014,07,27
119,Brilliant weekend!,"If you like the idea of being on a cruise ship but don't fancy going on a cruise, then Sunborn is the answer!  An easy check-in process with well informed staff, excellent breakfast choices, good food available in the bar area and very comfortable rooms.  If the weather allows, a drink on the deck is recommended and provides superb views of London",5,2014,07,27
119,A fun base for a London mini-break,"Friendly, excellent service. Great to chill out with a glass of wine on deck, watching the sun set whilst looking out on the stunning view of the London skyline. Rooms very spacious and spotlessly clean. Would definitely recommend.",5,2014,07,27
119,Incorrect information,"I booked 3 nights in Sunborn London with the hope of having an excellent end to our 2 weeks family vacation in UK. To say the least, it was a total disaster. Staff was friendly but that ends there. The deal was to pay for 2nights and stay for 3nights, which at 600£ a night is totally overpriced for what comes next. There was mention on Expedia that the place had a spa but we found as soon as we checked in that they dont have one! We booked a table at the restaurant for dinner with friends. The food was ok but it took so long to be served that kids got really hungry through the hour long wait for their chicken nuggets. The next day morning we all slept till late from our previous travels and at 10am i looked up the room service menu and called reception and asked me to put me to room service. Then i hear that, against all advertising, there is NO room service. For that price of room costing an average 400£ a night, I would have stayed in any other normal hotel and expected atleast room service. Then on, for the rest of the time we had no use of the grand suite than for sleeping whilst we looked to dining all meals elsewhere. The alleyways were smelling of oil i thought, the balcony by design is shared with other rooms and the yacht was further away from the road and luggage assistance was not provided even when departing. Much was expected but we were let down to a great extent. Will not make this mistake again.",1,2014,07,25
119,Just had drinks...,"Found this by accident so popped in for drinks on a Sunday afternoon.
Nice relaxing area to sit out the back of the boat in the sun, and the drinks were not extortionate.

Worth a visit....and the food looked good too,",4,2014,07,25
119,An amazing experience! ,"I've stayed with the sunborn before, when it was much smaller and located at a different site.

This new updated vessel is outstanding! They honestly have thought of everything and are amazing at the kind of service they provide! 

I'm normally not easily pleased, being in the hotel trade it's very easy for me to scrutinize everything. Although I have great difficulty even having 1 negative thing to say about this hotel! 

To start off with, this was the stay after our wedding, we booked very easily and comfortably on the phone, was offered a decent room for the night in question, I informed the hotel this was my first wedding night so please can you provide me with something sea facing! 'Not an issue' said the receptionist! 

Up on arrival, it seems almost James Bond! It's phenomenal the sheer size and quality of the vessel! The staff all are perfect and fit in very well! Especially the reception staff, very well spoken and very well knowledged!

We were upgraded to a junior suit, compliments of the management! Which was like WOW! upon arrival to the room, the feeling was only second to winning the lottery! it was like we'd died and gone to heaven! 

Every inch of this space was spotless, the bathroom was remarkable, everything from the coffee maker to the balcony was dripping with class!! Its hard to fantom this is a boat!!

There was a special hand written note on the table from the managment, congratulating use on our day and life's together, complimentary champagne! Even did the most amazing sculpture with towels I've ever seen! It was spectacular! 

You get a Sony pad to see what's going on where in the hotel and surrounding areas, 2 quality LED's, all the towels you can think off! Phones everywhere! Wifi everywhere, the list really goes on! 

The staff even arranged a pizza delivery at almost 2am! We're others have simply failed.

The carpet was indulging, as were the sofa's, the bed was the best sleep I've had in months! 

The views over London are simply picturesque. And surprising the entire vessel is very quite! 

All in all the hotel, the staff, the vessel, every inch of this hotel is nothing less then absolutely brilliant! 

We had the most amazing time, only thing which was a negative is we had to leave! 😔

Thank you sunborn for a truly unforgettable experience.

Your first honeymoon couple!

119,Lovely,"I booked this hotel the same day I arrived in there. It was the only hotel I could find a room in a reasonable price (under 150 pounds) the same day in London. The only minus was that I booked via Expedia the same day, they charged me 139 pounds. When arriving at the hotel they told me that Expedia hasn't charged me yet and the hotel will - and the price is 89 pounds. I was excited! Later I noticed that actually I HAD been charged by Expedia for the amount of 139 pounds and not the 89 pounds. So the staff gave me wrong information. Despite this, the staff were really friendly.

Despite this confusion, I was really glad I could get a room for under 150 pounds in London at the last minute - and the hotel was really lovely! The best hotel I've been to in London (or almost anywhere). Huge, clean, beautiful room, quiet and although the location was a bit out from the city centre, it was actually quite nice to see this neighbourhood as well. And there was the DLR station nearby. Free, really good coffee available in the room. There was also free wifi and a tablet in the room. Easy access from the O2 by public transport. I used the Emirates Air Line (cable car) to go there to a concert and came back by tube & DLR (stop Custom House). Very convenient.

Breakfast (included in the room price) would've been nice.

Some of the signs and other stuff in the hotel were in Finnish, and the personnel told me the boat is actually Finnish which was a funny coincidence (as I am Finnish too).

The check-out time was a bit confusing as well. At the web page it said that it's 10:30, Expedia told me it's 11:00 and when I went to ask this at the reception desk, they told me it's 12:00. Ummm, ok. So I left a bit before noon.

Overall it was a really nice experience and I will definitely consider this hotel (if the prices stay moderate) next time I'm in London.",5,2014,07,24
119,A different experience,"I stayed at the Sunborn London on the 15th and 16th June 2014 as we were going to see a concert at the O2. I did have some reservations after reading one review which stated that there was no transport to get back resulting in a long walk. However this is not true, the tube station is close-by and it was only two stops to the O2 albeit you have to change trains in-between. Technically this was very easy. Alternatively you can travel across on the cable cars as they are open until about 9pm but need to come back on train.  
The room was very nice, comfy bed, tea and coffee machine and free wifi and tablet in the room. I did not eat in the restaurant so cannot say whether this is any good or not. As you are close to the City Airport it can be a little noisy if you have your windows open but I guess you are visiting London so would technically be out and about. As for noise from the planes, well as soon as my head it the pillow I was asleep so I didn't hear them. When windows shut it's not noisy.
There are a few places near the yacht to eat although a tad expensive for the food that they serve, but all in all it was a good experience and I would stay there again.",4,2014,07,22
119,Slept like a baby and 5 star service,"Spent a night here as it was husbands birthday but I was also at at a conference at Excel.
The boat couldn't have been any closer to the entrance which was perfect and you feel very important being greeted by the security guards at the lifts to reception.
We were greeted by plenty of smiling faces behind the reception desk, waiting to help us.
My colleagues and I were able to store our bags till check in and my husband arrived.

I asked them to spoil my husband and I paid for a champagne and chocolates package. WELL, I was not disappointed, in fact they went so overboard my husband of 21 years thought his luck was well and truly in!! Towel craft swans and a giant heart made of rose petals were strewn across the bed. More petals were on the window sill, in the bathroom etc, fabulous.

The breakfast was extra but seriously worth it, great buffet selection and fresh fruit salads, pastries tea and coffee.

I can't recommend this hotel highly enough, maybe if they do upgrade to 5 star a pool would mean I would never leave!

Thank you for giving us a great experience.",5,2014,07,22
119,Looks good but.....,"I booked this hotel for my boyfriends birthday as a suprise. I emailed the hotel in advance and they promised chefs tasters and an ice bucket on arrival. We travelled from birmingham thinking we would have chefs tasters when we got there, but nothing!! We went to reception and asked for these and still nothing so we went out!! When we got back there was an ice bucket , so back to reception where someone took the bucket from me then left me standing there for 10 mins till I complained! We had breakfast the following morning which was excellent. Upon returning to our room we fancied a coffee on the fancy machine but found out none of the plugs worked!! When we checked out we spoke to reception and they said tell us next time you visit!!! ",2,2014,07,22
119,Large Security Guard ruined visit,"Really mixed feelings on this place following my visit at the weekend. My girlfriend and I visited the Sunborn last Friday and were impressed with the set up and the atmosphere, service, quality etc. We were so impressed that we invited my parents the following day as they are looking for a venue for a wedding anniversary party. After we paid for our drinks, we were approached by a large security guard who insisted, to our absolute shock, that we were tress passing. Confused and slightly irritated by this man, we questioned what he meant by ""tress passing"" as we had just bought a drink and were leaving anyway. The security guard escorted us off the boat. We were shocked. This man has let down the hotel, and clearly doesn't know what his job is meant to be. He was unapproachable and made disgusting and belittling comments to us as we left the boat. My parents are in their 60s and it goes without saying incredibly look innocent. This man is disgusting, and I hope he is identified quickly. For a new hotel, it is staff like this who will put people off.  I phoned and complained immediately, but the duty manager was almost dismissive (it wasn't that busy), didn't take my contact details etc. We will be going back to make a formal complaint.",2,2014,07,21
119,What a treat!,"Booked the Sunborn as somewhere to stay after watching Monty Python at the O2.  We travelled to London by train then crossed from Paddington by tube and DLR to Custom House stop.  This was a short walk to the yacht.  The area is lovely with a number of various restaurants and cafés.  On entering the reception area at the yacht I was stunned it really is beautiful.  The staff were welcoming, helpful and cheery.  The room was big, clean and had the air of luxury about it! The bathroom was excellent and the shower powerful with lovely Molton Brown toiletries!  The Sony tablet in the room was a nice touch.We had a drink on the deck at the rear of the yacht we were lucky to have beautiful sunshine!  The city airport is close but once inside the yacht I didn't here it.  The cable car is within easy walking distance and once over the other side the O2 is really close with excellent restaurants, you can also pick up a water bus over there which is excellent for seeing the sights from the river. 
I can't recommend the Sunborn highly enough a great treat",5,2014,07,19
119,Ideal for visiting 02 centre,"We saw Monty Python at 02. Hotel was a lovely treat, and quirky being on a boat. Friendly welcome from reception staff and room ready on time. 02 easy to get to via Emirates cable car and return on tube/dlr.

A few small service issues with slow bar service. Rooms are very comfortable, no issues. Breakfast was OK, but buffet style and not very hot.

Hotel in not yet officially open, so I am sure these issues will get ironed out. Would certainly use again if visiting the area.",4,2014,07,19
119,Outstanding!,"We stayed on this yacht in July 2014 during its soft opening period. We had a classic twin room (ie a basic one), and contrary to one other reviewer's speculation the lack of balcony was no problem. Our room had a good view over the dock. The room was excellent, with deep carpet and very good sound insulation including double-glazed window. As a result we heard very little of other guests. We had the occasional aircraft from the nearby London City Airport but did not find this intrusive. We had a good seating area with double sofa, coffee table, fridge and TV. Other useful items were a tablet computer, coffee maker as well as kettle, and retractable washing line in the shower cubicle. The bed was the most comfortable I have slept in for a long time - better than at home. Two different types of pillow are supplied, so you can adjust sleeping position. Air conditioning was effective and black-out curtains  provided.
The bathroom was fairly small but well planned with a good-size shower. Lovely towels and luxury Molton Brown toiletries.
As for location, the hotel is some distance from the central London tourist spots but is a stone's throw from the Excel conference centre, and the O2 arena is across the river reachable by the Emirates cable car. One reviewer said he walked a long way to the station: in fact, the Docklands Light Railway (DLR) station Custom House is 5 minutes' walk much of which is by a covered walkway.
We did not use the restaurant so cannot comment on this. There are a number of eating places nearby including in the Excel centre.
In summary, my advice is to book this hotel straight away before the soft opening period ends and they increase the prices! A short journey on the DLR was in our view well worth it, as we would have paid much more to get the same quality in central London.",5,2014,07,16
119,Sunborn pleasure,"We stayed at this beautiful yacht on 11th July, , we were seeing Robbie Williams at O2 that night,arrived  early afternoon and was very impressed with what we saw, once boarding the boat was explicit, beautiful beyond words, our room was fantastic, staff from reception to bar staff etc totally perfection,, must admit, very very expensive, kit kat in room, £2 , peanuts £2.50' bottle of water £2.50' which we didn't eat , we decided to have a late lunch which was basically burger and fat fries £18 each but was beautiful, drinks very dear, but  apart from hubby moaning didn't really care £11.25 for large vodka and lemonade. Only problem we had was when we got back from Robbie there was a crowd of so called young teachers, the public are allowed on boat even if they are not staying, which to me normally is no problem, but as we sat out on deck, the fowl mouth and swearing and loudness was annoying me, a lot of people were looking at them but I had to say something explaining that I have a 21,18 and 14 year old at home and I wouldn't put up with my children swearing and talking how they were, I got an apology but one lovely lady bought me and my hubby a drink to say sorry even though she had nothing to do with it, but thank her anyway, but seemed to me that staff were frightened to say something to them !!!! But after mentioning it on check out, it was mentioned that once the yacht opens up properly, only people on it are allowed to drink etc on it, biggest problem was the queue for checking out, but apart from that a truly wonderful experience, will def stay again, but please lower the price on drinks and food, that was the only thing that annoyed me !!!!!",5,2014,07,13
119,Once the soft opening kinks are worked out...,"I stayed at the Sunborn London in July, 2014, during their soft opening period.  Anyone who has been to a hotel or restaurant during this type of period knows that things will not be functioning at 100%, but you can get a pretty good idea of the place.  I'd venture a guess that once things are going full speed, this place will be great.  It was already about 90% there.  The service was very friendly, but came up a little short in the knowledge department.  Where this was an issue though, it was on matters where I think the staff just had not had reason to learn the answers to questions.  The room was very spacious and comfortable, except the air conditioning had a very hard time keeping up with the heat from the sunlight, and there was an issue with some of the plugs, both which I brought to the staff's attention,  They offered a new room which we declined, as we were able to work around both issues.  Again, I would imagine these will be taken care of in time for their formal opening.

The breakfast buffet was fantastic, except they should make the fried eggs in smaller batches.  They were good, but had that ""been sitting here for a bit"" feel, but not enough to keep me from partaking of my share.  Everything else on the buffet was top notch.

While not in the middle of London tourist activities, it is located just a couple of minutes from the DLR line which connects to the Underground system, and is location right outside the Excel conference center, so would be ideal accommodations for those in town for events at Excel.",4,2014,07,13
119,Amazing find!,"We stayed here as we were attending a Robbie Williams concert at the O2 and what a fantastic choice we made.  The staff are attentive and friendly - we were greeted with a glass of Prosecco (or two) upon arrival and our room was spotless and spacious with a view across to the O2.  Breakfast the next morning was plentiful and again, attentive.  We would never have received this attention at a chain hotel and certainly not for the price we paid.  We will definitely return to this original experience and recommend it to anyone we know going to London soon.  It deserves to do really, really well.  Well done to every member of staff, you really are a credit to The Sunborn London.  Thank you for a fabulous stay on your pretty yacht. X",5,2014,07,13
119,Amazing and unique hotel,"The hotel was fantastic! A very unique setting on the Thames with beautiful views of the city.  All of the staff were very friendly and could not have been more eager to please. 
We were lucky enough to stay in a large double room.  Everything was spotless and the room had all the modern facilities you would expect and more. 
The on board restaurant was great and the food was fairly priced. 
I will definitely be returning and would recommend it highly.",5,2014,07,12
119,Great experience,"I stayed for one Friday night before a meeting the next day. Every aspect of the stay was perfect, from the initial greeting at reception, excellent meal, great views and the most comfortable bed I've ever slept in.",5,2014,07,09
119,Amazing Experience,"This has got to be one of the best hotels I have stayed in in London. It was so different from any other hotel. I had a river side view room, it was so nice to sit a relax on the balcony. The food... well let's put it this way I would differently go again just for the food. The service was excellent,the staff were very happy and helpful. In the evening on the deck is not to be missed the view is amazing. This Hotel is in a great location with DLR and Emirates Air Line near by. 
If you are going to the 02, you must stay here it will top off your evening.",5,2014,07,08
119,Decent!!,"The mrs and I stayed here for one night just because. I must say I was impressed and the photos are quite accurate.

Iv had experiences when the photos and reality are far apart...not this hotel.

Its something different but make sure you get a room with a balcony. I imagine the rooms without arent as nice.

The staff were very nice and the breakfast is a buffet so I was happy (as im greedy like that)

Would definitely recommend this as its more memorable",4,2014,07,08
119,Outstanding Experiance.,"Spent the weekend at the hotel for my wedding anniversary, from the moment I got through the door to the time I left I felt nothing but welcome. The facilities were excellent and the proximity to local attractions was great. The city was only two stops away on the DLR and the underground. The Emirates Air Line is walking distance from the hotel. I got a return package on the cable car and access to the exhibition which was good value for only £15. If you go early in the morning you will be able to get a cable car to yourself as it’s not too busy.",5,2014,07,07
119,"Superb, Awesome and Great Staff","As per previous review - WOW. We stayed there so to see Monty Python at the 02. So only one night. How convenient as well. A short stroll to the cable car going over the river to the 02. Also London City Airport is within walking distance.
The yacht is jaw dropping to look at then when you get on board everything is spotless and beautiful.
Sitting on the deck with a cocktail and a club sandwich, looking at Canary Wharf, O2 and the cable car is just so nice, especially on a hot day.
The staff are all very pleasant and can't do enough to make you feel at home. After the show we arrived back rather hungry and although the kitchen was closed, the bar manager offered to make us up a charcuterie with some toast (which wasn't even on their menu).
Fantastic value as well.
This will be the only place I will stay if going to the East side of London.
24 hr Parking was only £15
I can't think of one reason to stay at the other hotels around this yacht. We WILL be going back for a longer stay next time, to spoil ourselves rotten again!!",5,2014,07,07
119,Fantastic Experience - Not to be missed!,"I spent a lovely birthday weekend aboard the Sunborn and was delighted with the experience. Firstly greeted by experienced, professional and friendly staff that were more than accommodating and willing to go out of the way for its customers. 

The rooms are in excellent condition, spacious and cleaned to the highest of standards. 

The food aboard was incredible, I had the Asparagus Risotto for lunch and my partner had the Seabass with Pak Choi! Only dissapointment was that I could not eat more of the delicious food.

Dinner was busy and the atmosphere was lovely! We enjoyed a Fillet Steak watching the lights of the Canary Wharf.

Management Team are fantastic and really go out of there way to make your stay enjoyable. 

Had a wonderful birthday - Big Thank you!",5,2014,07,07
119,Fabulous-truly a London gem -pure Luxury,"This luxury Yacht Hotel -is perfection.We stayed for one night when visiting London to attend the Coldplay concert at Albert Hall.Firstly location is superb,3 stops on DLR ,hotel has arranged good rates for parking-but you can park at Westfield for £5 for 24 hrs so perfect.If you are attending the O2 you could not go wrong staying here-Victoria Docklands is a beautiful area and we opted to stop at Canary Wharf and people watch whilst eating Al Fresco .We arrived to be greeted by a very polite porter who took our bags , once we went to check in we where advised the manager wanted to personally meet us to congratulate us on our 21st wedding anniversary.We were given a tour and some history of the Yacht and then complimentary drinks on the deck-it was a lovely touch -nothing better on a sunny day sipping wine and watching the sun go down over the London Skyline.We then had another surprise to find we had been given a complimentary upgrade to a junior suite.OMG-fabulous--luxury bathroom with Molton Brown toiletries,living area with flowers ,state of art coffee machine,then we went to the bedroom -rose petals on the bed -exceptionally romantic gesture !-and then the luxury of our own private river view balcony- really beats a standard hotel room.We did not eat at the restaurant -however there were several people in when we went through,We went off for our concert feeling refreshed and spoilt ! we thought the service and attentiveness couldn't get any better ,however when we returned  complimentary luxury chocolates and my favourite macaroons were waiting-truly thoughtful. The room was exceptionally clean,the staff very attentive,the location beautiful ,its a great location and a real gem-we will undoubtedly return
I highly recommend a stay on this luxury yacht.
Thank you to the  Manager & Staff for making this a very memorable trip-hope to see you again soon",5,2014,07,06
119,WOW. Exceeded all expectations,"Cannot fault this hotel. I forgot a card for my wife's anniversary so dropped the hotel a line asking if they could assist. When we arrived we were 3 hours before check in but were offered complimentary drinks on the deck whilst our room was prepared. A short while after reception advised us the room was ready and that we had been given a complimentary upgrade to an executive room. We walked into the room to find towel art, petals on the bed, a tray of amazing sweets and both a card for my wife and a handwritten letter from the manager. The room was immaculate and had a lovely balcony overlooking the dock. There is a Sony tablet in place of the usual paper hotel guides and a lavazza coffee machine. The bed is so comfortable and it really was the best 2 night stay in London I have had in a very long time. DLR a short walk away, as is a Tesco express, NISA local plus several bars and restaurants. The Emirates airline and O2 are also both very close. The staff are so polite and helpful and I cannot recommend this place highly enough. We will definitely be back!",5,2014,07,06
119,Lovely,"We stayed overnight as we were going to a show at the  O2. Sunborn was perfect. It is virtually on top of Excel and as there was nothing going on there that night it was extremely quiet. It was easy to get to the O2 via the Emirates sky cable car- cost-about £4 each for a single journey. The cable car stops at 9.00pm so had to return by underground.We ate at the O2 where there is plenty of choice.We were pleasantly surprised at the ease of getting back via tube. I thought it would be horrendous but the queue for the tube moved quickly.  and as most people were going back to central London, it was easy as very few were going back to Canning Town on Jubilee line and then on to excel on DLR. It took about 20 minutes from leaving the stadium.
The yacht is lovely. We were there before it officially opens so I don't know if the rates will increase. We had the basic king room on Deck one.The room was really spacious and very clean. There were lovely Moulton Brown toiletries in the bathroom.Our rate didn't include breakfast so can't comment on that. I would go back if the room rate was reasonable as it is so easy to access central London .The staff that we came across were very helpful, friendly and pleasant. Although the yacht is under the London City flight path, we really were not disturbed by noise.",4,2014,07,05
119,A truly different type of five star hotel,"We stayed on the sunborn which is in the Royal Victoria docklands, what a fabulous location and hotel. We had the classic room which was large and with all the amenities anybody could wish for, such as an iPad to use while on board the ship with excellent coffee machine etc. in the room.
We have booked this hotel to celebrate our daughter's birthday and could recommend this hotel for any special occasion.
The sunborn is truly a luxurious yacht with the matching décor throughout the yacht. We had breakfast outside on the top deck on Sunday morning. With one of the best backdrops anywhere in the world. The whole crew were attentive in every detail. A fabulous experience and certainly will be returning shortly.",5,2014,07,05
119,Something a bit different,"Stayed here to attend an event at Excel, location is perfect.
Large room, sofa very uncomfortable. 
Good nights sleep, very quite with comfortable bed.
Fantastic shower with Molton Brown products, plenty of thick white towels.
Didn't use bar or restaurants on board as expensive.",4,2014,07,04
119,Something different in a cool location with first class service,"We stayed at the Sunborn in early July as we were going to the O2 to see Monty Python. It was an amazing location to visit the O2 as we were from door to door in 15 minutes via Emirates Airline Cable Car, which was also a great experience.

The hotel itself was amazing, much bigger rooms than usual for a London hotel and with a great balcony. Furnishings were beautiful and the beds very comfy, plus Molton Brown toiletries, a fab coffee machine and in room iPad were some lovely little touches.

We paid £180 but breakfast was on top, which at £20 each felt a little steep, it was good but nothing outstanding. The staff were first class and couldn't do enough to help. The bar is rather expensive, even by London standards (£11 double gin and tonic!) but the views from the deck make it out if the ordinary and worth the extra. Nearest station is Excel (in the DLR) but if you are a very light sleeper be warned you are near city airport and there are a few early morning flights.

All in all a very luxurious stay and great value for a London Hotel with a difference.",5,2014,07,03
119,Unforgettable experience,"When we booked tickets for a concert at the O2 as part of our Silver Wedding celebrations I wanted to find a suitably special venue for our overnight stay in close proximity to the venue. Sunborn London proved to be a fabulous choice which completely surpassed our expectations. As a luxury yacht moored a short, fun cable car ride across the river to the O2 it is in a unique position. As a hotel it is outstanding. The accommodation is spacious and appointed to a very high standard. The restaurant and bar areas are welcoming and relaxing - with spectacular views across Victoria dock to the O2, Canary Wharf and the City beyond - a lovely spot to sit and enjoy a drink in the sunshine! (incoming flights to City Airport were more interesting than irritating and proved no issue from a noise point of view at all as they stop in the evening). Most of all though the staff were exceptional. They all seemed to share our enthusiasm and excitement for the yacht and were quietly intent on ensuring we had a memorable stay. They succeeded - and I have no hesitation in recommending Sunborn London as a special and exciting alternative to conventional hotels in the Docklands area of the City.",5,2014,07,03
119,Relaxing stay,"My husband and I stayed here for a sightseeing weekend in London. It's is currently a soft opening which means some things are still being done to the ship, they where laying new carpets in some areas whilst we where staying. The room was the most immaculately clean room I have ever stayed in with think plush carpets and king size beds. A great little addition was the coffee machine and an in room table so you can browse the internet or order room service. We didn't eat in the restaurant as there wasn't much choice however the breakfast was very fresh and tasty. 
We would defiantly stay again as beats staying in a boring hotel chain. London very easy to get to with the DLR a stones throw away  ",5,2014,07,03
119,Great / high-end family experience,"We had the pleasure of staying at (on?!) Sunborn London last weekend as a birthday treat for one of our 3 children - it proved to be a treat for the entire family! The hotel seems to have opened very recently (we live in London and heard about it through friends) and despite this there was a very friendly and professional service and a warm welcome at the front desk. We had dinner on the boat - a great selection of quality seafood for adults and a friendly menu for children, a friendly, non-fussy service. Same quality of service for breakfast + great and healthy variety. What really wowed us what the fantastic night views, especially from the decks and the impressive look of the boat gives a perfect backdrop for one or two family pictures - for us to remind ourselves of a great weekend! A really welcome and impressive addition to the London hotel scene",5,2014,07,02
119,5 stars all the way ,"Can't fault this hotel. Well worth a visit, 

In my eyes you won't be disappointed, nothing better than sitting having a glass of wine on the deck with the sun blaring down, 

What makes it even better it's on the flight path for London city airport so you get to watch the planes aswell 😜  ",5,2014,07,02
119,Stunning Hotel,"We stayed for one night on Sunborn and had an absolutely fantastic time. The hotel was clean, staff were all extremely friendly and helpful. Our room was spotless, very spacious and well equipped. It really made our stay so relaxing and enjoyable. We ordered room service which came promptly and the breakfast was delicious! We wish we were staying for longer. Will definitely be staying again, already looking forward to it. ",5,2014,07,01
119,Beautiful,"This yacht is fantastic. The room was very spacious, and the yacht was stunning, 5 floors of beauty! This is an amazing stay in a beautiful location, with lots of character and very personable staff. 
A must visit on any trip to London!!! 
Go see for yourself
",5,2014,07,01
119,Soft opening has teething problems... but very promising start!,"My husband treated me to a night on the Sunborn London for my birthday this year and I fell in love with it all: the concept, the staff, the food, the yacht itself - a floating hotel with the flexibility to move on if the need arises, such as civil unrest or economic downturn. 

The yacht was built in Finland so some of the signs are also translated into Finnish, which I think added to the quirk of staying on a luxury yacht rather than detracted. The views across to Canary Wharf in the Docklands were fantastic: we were blessed with good weather during our stay and the sunset was sublime - the whole area was incredibly peaceful given it is located in the busy metropolis that is London. I was amazed at how close the Excel centre was - it really is right next to the hotel! And for us, the proximity to the Emirates Air Line meant a cheeky ride on the cable car the morning after! 

The hotel is 'anchored' through massive steel straps that connect the yacht to the wharf, so you have no fear of drifting off (idyllic though that may sound!) The area has clearly undergone significant regeneration, so if you don't fancy sampling the fares of Head Chef Pawel in the on-board restaurant you can venture outside a short 5 mins walk to find a variety of food outlets that cater for all tastes. However, we stayed in for dinner and enjoyed two courses each - I can highly recommend the scallops starter and seabass main - absolutely delicious and beautifully presented! Just a shame there wasn't more choice on the menu - but perhaps that will come in time (it is early days after all!)

The staff are super-attentive and the pride in their work is clear for all to see: smiling, happy faces, genuinely concerned that you have a fantastic experience, and importantly they all live locally. Nothing is too much trouble for them.

The rooms were very comfortable with super king sized beds fitted with soft cotton sheets and duvet: I'm a light sleeper but I slept so deeply in that bed that I didn't even hear the sounds of the planes from City Airport (which were, to be honest, quite loud in the evening as the wharf is directly underneath the flight path). The Molton Brown bathroom goodies were a nice touch, as were the robes hanging waiting for us in the wardrobe.

There were some issues with the hotel itself: the door entry system to our corridor was malfunctioning and wouldn't let us in, the bar area wasn't finished, the shower was a little basic compared to the otherwise luxurious surrounds. However, I put this down to teething problems and it would certainly not deter me from visiting again - rather, I am curious to experience another night aboard once the yacht is fully operational and has overcome its in initial problems - isn't that the point of a soft opening after all?",4,2014,06,30
119,Loved it!,"We were fortunate enough to spend an evening on the Sunborn and had a fabulous stay. The check in experience was seamless and the suites stunning. The cabin was clean, spacious and full of all the home comforts you would want (including a decent coffee machine!) and a lovely balcony overlooking the river for our morning coffee. We enjoyed sundowners at the bar with views out over the night lights of Canary Wharf. We ate in the hotel and the food was fine dining and a lovely treat with the service attentive and friendly. Our stay in the suite was very comfortable and the buffet breakfast in the morning was something which I would go back for alone. All in all an excellent ""floatel"" with great facilities.",5,2014,06,30
119,A big let down,"I was so excited to be staying on a yacht for our little night away in London whilst we finally had babysitters, which is very rare living 140 miles away from relatives and having 3 children. After arriving at the hotel at 11.30pm after a day of watching shows and sightseeing, we entered the yacht and the entrance is spectacular with its sweeping sparkling staircase, we checked in and the staff were lovely. They gave us our key card and we made our way to the room. We arrived at the room, to find that people were already in the room, which was embarrassing. We headed back to the desk, who gave us new room keys. We went to our new room, to find we were on the land side, so the gorgeous via i was looking forward to was non-existent, which was more annoying as the original room we got was on the dock overlooking the water. The room was ok, not the luxury i was expecting for a room that goes out at almost £400, admittedly i had only paid £220 as it had not officially opened. However i don't expect to find bottles of orange juice with half peeled reduced stickers in the mini bar that were reduced to £0.29 and to be charged £2.50 for!! There were no milk for the tea and coffee facilities, i had to call reception to ask for some, and was brought 5, between 2 of us. We also asked if there was another duvet we could have as my husband is allergic to the feathers in the one we had. There wasn't and he was brought the thinnest single duvet instead. The bed was two singles pushed together, not the comfiest bed ever that i have seen on the over reviews, as the seam was really uncomfortable. We also found a used contact lens on the floor, and were woken up at 9.15 by room service who had gotten the wrong room. Overall our stay was hugely disappointing. We were given a 20% discount on leaving for the room mix up. I didn't stay to explain about the other faults as our taxi was waiting and even though we clicked the fast check out option, check out took 15 minutes and we were the only customers there waiting to leave. Our taxi was waiting for us outside the Novotel where the sign said the room rate was £75, and we really believed we would have had better service and a better room there.",2,2014,06,30
119,Popped in for lunch,My friend heard about Sunborn and as a surprise took me there for lunch. As non-residents we were unable to book but were made very welcome. It's so new everything is sparkling and the staff are fresh and keen to help. We were almost alone in the restaurant and had impeccable service. The food was lovely. I had pâté with pear to start then breast of chicken on sweet potato mash for main. Presentation and taste were perfect. Not huge meals but plenty for us. The desserts offered were however not that tempting. In fact neither of us had dessert. We had a nice bottle of chilled Pinot Grigio and lovely coffee. I took photos and have recommended to all my friends. Hope to have a cheeky stop over one day!,5,2014,06,29
119,Absolutely Stunning!,"I had the wonderful opportunity to stay with Sunborn London on a leisure visit just after the yacht docked and cannot rave enough about the experience we had. It feels like you're going on a cruise but actually stay in London. My favourite part: Breakfast served in the deck restaurant with the most amazing views over the skyline of London and you can even go outside to relax on the various decks and take in the sun - I'm sure this would make the perfect wedding venue as well. This is a great new addition to London's hotel landscape and the staff we dealt with all were very excited, helpful and professional. Last but not least, I want to thank Andreas Stys, General Manager, who we met personally during our stay, for a night to remember and wish him and his team all the best!",5,2014,06,29
119,Wonderful stay!,"I had such a lovely time with my family. We had fun, we enjoyed the vibe from the bar. The staff was lovely, especially Chantelle from reception, even though our AC wasn't working in our room. She calmed us and was willing to help. She recommended food from Lands End and was delightful. Nice experience, good concept also.",5,2014,06,28
119,Our stay!,"We had an absolutely amazing experience here! At first we were both a bit skeptical about the idea of sleeping on water but you can hardly feel any difference between land and sea - no sea sick feeling at all. The hospitality was 10/10 from the bartenders, to the waiters, to the front desk employees and the cleaning crew. I wish we had another night to do it all over again.

Also excellent restaurant recommendation provided at the near by pier. 

Top notch all round service from Lakeishia Bascome - she made our stay special.",5,2014,06,25
119,Wow,The wow factor was from when we saw the yacht to when we left what a overnight way to stay it was in easy location for the 02 arena . Our room had everything we needed and very clean the staff were all helpful and nothing was to much trouble for them from the cleaning staff to the managers I think name badges would be of help so we can ask people by name if we need help otherwise THANKYOU for a great weekend to all .,5,2014,06,23
119,How I would expect to be treated on my own Yacht,"I of course don't own my own super luxury yacht but have often imaged that if I did one of the best things about it would be the amazing service and attentiveness of the staff and crew.  Staying on the Sunborn Hotel Yacht in London for two nights gave me that feeling.  The hotel doesn't ""officially"" open until July 1st and is currently operating as a soft opening however the staff made it feel like they've been doing this for years.  The room was fantastic in its appointments and comfort.  The restaurant breakfast was lovely.  The views from my room balcony and the restaurant patios were of a spectacular waterfront community.  The bed felt like sleeping on a cloud.  Right down to the comfort and operation of the bathroom features and shower water pressure.  The only glitches came with their WiFi service provider however other than a few moments of frustration, the stay was beyond my highest hopes when it was booked.  And the price for an executive suite was less than I've paid for poorly run chain hotels.  I would highly recommend this hotel and this staff to any executive business traveler and certainly to any couple that is looking for something special.",5,2014,06,19
119,Elegance,"Perfect location for Excel and really close to Custom Hse DLR station.  The rooms are large, really comfortable and well fitted out with most of the amenities you will need.  Has a great little Lavazza Espria coffee maker in the room as well as a kettle for teas.  The bed was really comfortable and I had several good nights sleep.  As for the staff they really are fantastic, from check-in to the wait staff at breakfast and dinner.  Even Housekeeping knocked on my door to ask if everything was okay.  Breakfast is a buffet which is constantly refilled with freshly cooked food, the choice was really good from smoked salmon, cold cuts, fruits, baked goods, cerials to a full cooked English breakfast.  My only suggestion would be to add name badges to staff as I didn't notice any.  Great Hotel.",5,2014,06,18
119,Staff fantastic.,"Stayed for two nights with my husband. Hotel not fully open yet but we could not find fault. Our room was great, comfy big bed, luxurious carpet and balcony with views. Room and all areas spotless. Obviously a real treat to stay on a luxury yacht however Sunborns greatest feature seems to be it's staff. Without exception helpful,polite and friendly. Also the bar staff make a fine caipirinha!",5,2014,06,15
119,"Elegant, charming, and unique ","Sunborn combines old school glamour with modern charm and amenities. And what could be better than sleeping and dining on a yacht?! (My balcony was fitted with deck chairs and all.) Perfect if attending a conference at Excel. Plus the staff is friendly and warm, especially Mariam. Amazing hotel.",5,2014,06,11
119,David J   'Great experience',"Last week I had the pleasure of staying onboard the new Sunborn Yacht in London.  I was not quite sure what to expect but it was an excellent experience.  From the friendly enthusiastic staff, to the spacious well finished room/cabin, to the quality food and not forgetting the night view of London skyline it was  truly enjoyable stay.",5,2014,06,10
119,Impressive!,"My husband and I stayed in a suite on the Sunborn Yacht on Friday 6th June for our anniversary and it was fabulous - especially the private sauna! We even had our own sun deck!

The staff were all very friendly and attentive and the service was excellent.

We ate in the restaurant in the evening and the food was marvelous - not cheap, but not silly prices either. Breakfast was extensive and was thoroughly enjoyed.

The bed was extremely confortable and huge!

We went on the United Emirates Cable Car over to the O2 as well - that was scary, but very cool and just a few minutes walk from the Yacht.

Would totally recommend.",5,2014,06,10
119,A truly amazing place to stay,"We were honoured to be part of the soft opening of this amazing hotel/ship and can only really state that everything is exceptional. Upon first arriving I was a bit concerned that my non-celebrity/rich/famous status would make me an unwanted; I couldn't have been further from the truth. The staff were so welcoming and friendly, they treated us like long time friends. The manager, Ramone, showed us to our room and was a pleasure to deal with very easy going and polite. The whole team were open to any comments and were a true delight - thank you. As for the room, it was immaculately clean and tidy. The towels were huge and soft, the carpet was deep and squidgy, the sheets were soft and welcoming, the bed was vast and possibly THE most comfortable bed I've ever slept in apart from my own at home!!! The room was beautifully appointed and I was not disappointed by a single thing. We will certainly be going back again and I wouldn't hesitate for a single second in recommending this stunning hotel to anybody staying in London, it really is a gem of a place and perfectly placed right by the Excel arena too.",5,2014,06,09
119,Unforgettable experience,"When my partner and I arrived with friends we were overwhelmed by the the warm hospitality that we received from the staffs. They assist us by taking our luggage to our room, very helpful. They were even so kind as to offer to order meal from outside for us as we arrived late and the restaurant on board was closed. The rooms were immaculate bed was very comfortable. During breakfast hours staffs were very helpful as my partner wasn't feeling well I came down to get our breakfast and the kind and attentive staffs offered to take my partner's breakfast up to our room. Thanks to all Sunburn staffs for your ambience. Can't wait to get back on board and enjoy luxury.",5,2014,06,08
119,Amazing,"Wow! Had an amazing stay at the Sunborn Hotel. Room was gorgeous, and really big for what I was expecting. If you get the chance make sure you upgrade to a room with a balcony. The chef there serves the best scallops ever. Already booked my return visit.",5,2014,06,08
119,Fantastic Luxury,"stayed at the sunburn london saturday 7th june to sunday 8th june and can not fault it at all, its on a soft open atm which is fine, staff at reception where fantastic can't fault them checked us in early and as room was nearly ready took are bag while we had a drink on the deck. the room we got was fantastic very very clean big bed and private balcony over looking the dock and over to the O2 and air line cable car, getting to and from the hotel was very easy with the dlr on its door step and also the tube and cable car, there plenty of bars around so perfect night, breakfast was spot on like you would get in a normal hotel like irbris. this is a unique experience that don't cost the earth. had fab views of canary warf from deck and rooms, beds where really nice to sleep in one of best nights sleep I've had in long time, all the staff where helpful and very chatty and friendly, i would recommend this to anyone as this is luxury and you will leave with a smile. will be booking again for next stay in london.",5,2014,06,08
119,Exciting Experience,"I stayed on the yacht with my parter and I really enjoyed myself. All staff was helpful and really friendly. Even though it was a soft opening!! Can't wait for the grand opening.  The front of house was so polite and professional. Lakiesha and Chantelle were really nice and couldn't do enough to help. We was even escorted to our room by Chantelle and she made sure we was very comfortable, lovely young lady. I can't wait to come back on with my children.",5,2014,06,04
119,Perfect Sheer Luxury,"We attended a wedding on the sunborn yacht  and stayed over night,from the moment we arrived we were made to feel special by all the staff the room was excellent with a balcony, food was fantastic we felt as we had been on a cruise the sunborn yacht is luxury with comfortable beds,everything you need to make your stay memorable.",5,2014,06,03
119,Wonderful stay on a Luxury yacht!!,"Just returned from a wonderful 3 night stay at the Sunborn. Yacht is fantastic,spotlessly clean,rooms are superb with balcony,Egyptian bedding,even own tablet for ordering room service!
Great views of Canary Wharf from on deck,hotel is out of London to the west,but easily accessible via DLR and also boat cruises, there are few shops round the corner and the Emirates cable car also,takes you over to the 02,good fun as its 300m high! We didn't have a meal on board but breakfast was fantastic. So if your after something different to a hotel,want to look like a millionaire, and fancy a bit of Luxury i would recommend the Sunborn! Thanks to Chantelle,Maryiam,Oyinda and the Concierge for all your help!

119,A floating Palace,"I had the pleasure of staying at the new Sunborn Yacht London last night, the hotel is a breath of fresh air a sheer delight to stay at compared to the other mundane hotels located in the Docklands / Excel area. Very spacious bedrooms with all the mod cons including a tablet in each room for guest services. hotel info, ordering room service or simply surfing the web. The staff/team are extremely professional, friendly and courteous - really they couldn't do enough to help up. The Hotel itself is ideally located for Canary Wharf and Excel or indeed Central London as it's located very close to the DLR. Food was out of this world, service even better and beds the most comfortable I've experienced in a long time, well done Sunborn and thanks for such a pleasant stay.",5,2014,06,02
119,No transport unsafe car park poor rooms will not go back!,When we arrived as a married couple we were shown to the room and it was two singles I had to go back to front and change room and it took ages as there was an issue with the keys we were shown to the next room and there were stains on the carpet and dust over furniture and as for transport there was not any back to the hotel and we had to walk two hours to get back also the hotel does not have parking there is a local car park (excel) which the hotel recommend at £15 per 24 hours the car park claims they have security but I did not see any and our car got broken into window smashed £800 of goods stolen from it will not stay again ever stayed 30 may 14 - 1 June 14 worst trip I have ever had.

119,Fabulous stay!,"Just had 2 nights at the new Sunborn Hotel.  We were regular visitors at the former hotel and the new hotel lives up to the memory of a fabulous stay. The hotel is only partially open but we have been treated like royalty.  The staff are all very friendly and can't do enough for you.  Room was spotless and very comfortable.  The staff are all very new to the job, all local people and all very friendly.   We would highly recommend a stay at Sunborn Hotel. We can't wait to return soon! Barry and Di",5,2014,06,01
119,Vacaciones de lujo,"El hotel es increíble tanto por lo novedoso de la experiencia, como por lo cuidado que está cada detalle.
La habitación que tuvimos era muy espaciosa y preciosa, con unas bonitas vistas.
El personal (recepción, personal del desayuno, personal de limpieza...) muy atento y amable, hacen que la experiencia sea inolvidable. Siempre tienen una sonrisa para ayudarte con cualquier cosa que necesites.
Es una zona tranquila, en la que pudimos descansar y que se encuentra muy bien comunicada con el centro, gracias a la Elisabeth Line (en 20-25 minutos estás en el centro de Londres).
Un hotel distinto, qué hará que tu experiencia sea inolvidable en una ciudad como Londres.",5,2023,02,27
119,Buona,"Posso solo parlare del ristorante e del bar. Personale cortese e gentile. Servizio veloce x le pietanze sono risultate di buona qualità e comunque con ingredienti freschi. Ho visto anche le camere e sono particolari, ma non vi ho soggiornato",3,2022,12,12
119,Hotel con mucho encanto,"Estuve este finde semana pasado con mis amigas. El hotel tiene muchísimo encanto.Es un barco de verdad..duermes en preciosos camarotes con vistas increibles. todas las instalaciones son nuevas y la limpieza es  excelente.
He de decir que nos encantó el desayuno,con muchísima variedad y ríquisimo.
Ademas tiene el metro al lado y enseguida llegabamos al centro..
Sin dudarlo repetiré.
Muyyyyrecomendable!!",5,2022,11,22
119,Una estadía fantástica!,"Estuvimos las noche del Sábado a Domingo durante la Semana Santa y ha sido una de las experiencias más gratas que he tenido en hoteles en mucho tiempo.  Mi Inglés no es muy bueno y no ha sido un problema en absoluto, el departamento de Recepción y del Restaurante hablan español y nos hicieron la estancia muy fácil. Estuvimos en una habitación con balcón privado donde las vistas eran relajantes. La habitación era muy grande y tenía sofá, las vistas eran fantásticas ya que estábamos en la cuarta planta. El desayuno de de ensueño con muchas variedades. Es un lugar único donde puedes pasar todo el día relajado bien en el bar o restaurante o tomando el sol tranquilamente en la terraza del bar. Felicidades por este día tan inolvidable. Gracias.",5,2022,04,18
119,London mal anders,"Wohnen auf einem Yacht Hotel. Ein, für Londoner Verhältnisse ausgezeichnetes Frühstück (bei Schönwetter am Aussendeck). Geräumige Zimmer mit Balkon. Auch Familienzimmer sind möglich. Ruhige Lage, in 20 Minuten ist man in der Stadt.",5,2019,10,10
119,Anders aber sehr zu empfehlen!,"Ich war für eine Nacht im Sunborn und durchwegs positiv überrascht.

Der Empfang bzw. Check-In verlief schnell und zügig. Die Mitarbeiter des Hotels waren stets freundlich, zuvorkommend und hilfsbereit.

Die Zimmer sind geräumig und großzügig geschnitten. Die Ausstattung und das Mobilar entsprechen dem Sternestandart. Die Sauberkeit war sehr zufriedenstellend.

Das Frühstück ist Durchschnittlich und wie so oft zu teuer. Da die Auswahl in keinem Verhältnis zum Preis steht.

Die Bar ist allerdings zu empfehlen. Sehr nettes Personal und vorallem bietet die Bar eine gute Auswahl diverser Getränke etc.

Zur Lage des Hotels:

Jeder der das Sunborn bucht sollte sich im klaren darüber sein, dass das Zentrum gute 20 minuten entfernt ist. Allerdings gibt es rund um das Hotel etliche Einkehrmöglichkeiten.

Auf alle Fälle ein tolles Erlebnis mal in diesem Hotel übernachtet zu haben.",4,2019,08,23
119,Eine Übernachtung auf einer Jacht,"Das Schiff lag für meine Pläne, Besuch der Messe, genial. Laufweg zum Messegelände ca. 150 Meter.Die Aufzug Benutzung ist etwas umständlich, aber das Ambiente des Schiffs, vor allem auch der Zimmer, entschädigt da schon sehr. Der Blick über die Themse, vor allem bei Dunkelheit, mit den vielen Lichtern, ist sehr beeindruckend. Das Frühstück war ok, aber mit 19 BPS eigentlich zu teuer.",4,2019,03,29
119,Mal was Anderes,"Falls man bei einem London-Besuch auch mal Greenwich/Blackheath besuchen möchte, so ist das Yacht Hotel ideal gelegen. Die Emirates Gondelbahn, die einen auf die andere Seite der Themse bringt, ist zu Fuss in ca 3 Minuten erreichbar.
Das Hotel hat echte Schiffsatmosphäre, die man natürlich mögen muss. Unser Zimmer war geräumig, das Badezimmer eher sehr klein. Dafür muss die Beleuchtung im Bad wirklich gelobt werden. Als Frau ist es selbst in den besten Hotels oft schwierig, Schmink-freundliche Beleuchtung im Bad vorzufinden. Das Sunborn hat sie!
Das Frühstück ist abwechslungsreich und es sei betont, dass die Früchte, selbst wenn sie nicht konsumiert wurden, immer wieder ersetzt wurden und damit immer top frisch waren.
Leider ist der Teppich im Speise/Frühstücksraum in die Jahre gekommen. Nicht nur dass er ziemlich verfleckt ist, er wirft auch Wellen, sodass Stolpergefahr besteht.
Auch der Umstand, dass vormittags um 9:30 die Tische im Freien noch die Konsumationsspuren des Vorabends aufweisen, ist nicht sehr einladend. Schade.",4,2018,08,14
119,UNA EXPERIENCIA DIFERENTE,"Me pareció un muy buen hotel, cuando se piensa que es un barco anclado en el río tal vez se puede pensar que no es tan bueno como pasa en otras ocaciones o que el paso de otras embarcaciones altera la tranquilidad. pero por el contrario este es un yate de lujo con todas las comodidades ideal para ferias de negocios por su ubicación pegado al centro de convenciones, las habitaciones son amplias y la gente muy cordial.",4,2017,12,27
119,Cenar bien en un barco en Londres,"No es el típico crucero fluvial de algunas grandes ciudades, es un impresionante yate estático convertido en hotel junto al Excel Exhibition Centre con varios restaurantes. Cenamos después de reunión de trabajo, ingredientes buenos y bien preparados, eso sí, si comes mucho las raciones son normales. Merece la pena el sitio y las vistas. ",4,2017,11,19
119,Impresionante ,"Estuvimos mi pareja y yo hace pocos días y nos llevamos una grata impresión de este hotel con encanto.
Un crucero anclado a tierra con unas vistas espectaculares del Londres más moderno,rompiendo así con la imagen clasicista que uno tiene de la capital británica.
En la misma línea moderna te encuentras dentro de un hotel flotante en el cuál,desde la recepción,como la habitabilidad y hasta el checkout se te hace cómodo y acogedor ,tanto por las instalaciones como por el amable y atento personal de este maravilloso y dinámico hotel.
No solo lo recomiendo,sino que volveré a este maravilloso lugar.

119,ESPECTACULAR!,"Un hotel espectacular, con unas vistas increíbles y un personal de 10.
Estuve esta semana pasando unos días de vacaciones en Londres y nos alojamos en el Sunborn. 
Una atención genial por parte del staff, muy atento y discreto, en las habitaciones no faltaba ningún detalle, con cafetera, aire acondicionado y todo ordenado con minucioso detalle. Una tablet que contiene información para conocer Londres, periódicos de cada país, acceso a internet, juegos, y toda la información del hotel con las cartas, room service, etc.
La cama muy cómoda y la habitación bastante amplia.
Sin duda volveré.",5,2017,09,10
119,Eine hervorragende Restauration,"Wer auf den Docklands das Außergewöhnliche sucht, für den ist dieses Yachthotel ein MUSS - wenigstens im Teeraum! Oder man speist bis 15 Uhr ein Deck tiefer von der vergünstigten Gängekarte. Die Weine sind erlesen, das Personal beweist noch Stil. In diesem Ambiente fühlen sich Verliebte wie Geschäftsleute bestens aufgehoben. Meine Hochachtung für eine gelungene Investition und Führung",5,2017,07,15
119,Ne vale la pena in tutti i sensi,"Vi consiglio sinceramente questo ristorante su uno yacht, si mangia da dio (cucina francese), location impareggiabile per la vista su Londra e per gli interni, se il lusso sfarzoso e un cameriere personale vi mettono in imbarazzo non fa per voi; ma se volete passare qualche ora nel lusso senza spendere troppo ci dovete venire. Aperitivo gin tonic 9£, Pims £8, coca 4£, a pranzo menù fisso 3  portate a 34£ bevande escluse, menù alla carta qualcosa in più ma il rapporto qualità prezzo e' assolutamente impareggiabile a Londra!!! Camerieri e metre gentilissimi. Il bacino e' sede di sports acquatici e nelle vicinanze potete prendere la funivia per andare al Greenwich . Consigliato alle coppie per fare colpo su qualcuno.

I really suggest to you this restaurant that is  on a yacht . The food is fantastico , The location has a sight on London, The inside forniture al luxury style. If you are not ashamed to live in Luxury style here you'll find  very good food at a very good price, at lunch you find menu at ;34£ and The gin tonic cocktail is only 9£. The port is a place for water sports, near The cable car that take you to Greenwich . I suggest to The couple for a romantic location. The staff is very kind and lovely",5,2017,06,25
119,"Sauber, gutes Frühstück","An der DLR Station Royal Victoria braucht man mit öffentlichen Verkehrsmitteln 1,5 Stunden zu 6 Pfund. Die gleiche Zeit wird mit dem Taxi auch benötigt, kostet jedoch 120 Pfund. Beide Angaben beziehen sich auf Heathrow als Flughafen. Wer kann, sollte den City-Airport anfliegen. Dieser liegt unmittelbarer Nähe. Flugzeuge fliegen regelmäßig über das Hotel, was jedoch nicht störend ist.

Der Empfang war freundlich und schnell.
Die Zimmer sind sehr geräumig und sauber. Das Bett ist sehr groß. Kostenfreie Nespresso-Kapseln und Kekse, sowie Mineralwasser stehen zur Verfügung.
Das Frühstück ist gut. Neben den typischen Warmspeisen, Eiergerichten, Aufschnitt, Marmelade, Honig und Joghurt, gibt es auch frisches Obst. Absolut ausreichend.
Einziges Manko ist der Teppichboden im Zimmer. Ich bin generell kein Freund davon, denn Flecke sind schnell und dauerhaft sichtbar.",4,2017,06,18
119,Servicio excelente de Inés,La verdad es un sitio espectacular con unas vistas inmejorables con un servicio impresionante sin ninguna tu lugar a dudas una muy buena experiencia nos indicaron un vino blanco muy acertado la camarera Inés muy atenta sin lugar a dudas volveremos,5,2017,05,30
119,Tolles Hotel,"Das Sunborn liegt direkt neben dem Ausstellungsgelände ExCeL London. Perfekt, falls man ein paar Tage an einer Tagung oder Ausstellung ist.
Das Personal ist sehr freundlich und zuvorkommend. Die Zimmer waren immer sehr sauber geputzt. Und hat das Ambiente auf diesem Schiff sehr gut gefallen. Kann ich weiterempfehlen ",5,2017,05,09
119,Sentirsi una regina,"Ero incuriosita, un albergo, uno yatch sul tamigi...bellissimo, gentilissimi soprattutto alla reception, avevo la prenotazione sul telefono che non aveva batteria, nessuna difficoltà!!!
L'unico problema, che credo sia solo mio, vedere dalla finestra della camera l'acqua che si muove ""fa strano""....ma basta chiudere le tende!
Io ci ritornerò!",5,2017,04,02
119,Particolare ,È uno Yacht convertito in Hotel. Camere eleganti e confortevoli; completa la colazione. Ideale come base di partenza per chi sceglie l'aeroporto di London City. Con la metropolitana 10 minuti da quest'ultimo e 15 dal centro. Good,4,2017,04,02
119,rilassante,"davvero un bel posto 
personale gentile 
location ok
colazione top
vista ok
l acqua del bacino verde ma questo non è da attribuire a loro
grazie davvero a tutto lo staff un esperienza da rifare peccato che siamo stati solo una notte",4,2016,10,11
119,Schwaches Frühstück,"Wir waren im September im Hotel Sunborn zugegen. Das Hotel ist sauber und stilvoll. Trotz Flughafen ist kaum etwas zu hören, die Betten sind sehr bequem.

Sehr freundliches Personal, einzig allein das Frühstück kann man sich sparen. Es kostet stolze 39 Pounds pro Person und pro Tag! Das Frühstück ist zudem teilweise ungeniessbar und an jedem Tag findet man die gleiche Auswahl an Getränken und Speisen vor.",4,2016,09,28
119,Es könnte noch ein bisschen besser sein,"Das Hotel ist eine Yacht. Das machtden Aufenthalt schon zu etwas Besonderen.
Der Empfang war freundlich und hilfsbereit. Unser Zimmer war groß genug für 2 Erwachsene und 2 Kinder. Einen Punkt Abzug gibt es für das Fenster (was sich nicht öffnen lässt) und die nicht ganz so gut funktionierende Klimaanlage (wir hatten dauerhaft 25 Grad im Zimmer).
Ansonsten gibt es eine absolute Weiterempfehlung. Es gibt zwei Supermärkte in 2 Minuten Entfernung. Ein günstiges öffentliches Parkhaus. Die DLR ist fußläufig. Und Restaurants gibt es auch mehr als genug.",4,2016,07,20
119,Stupendo,"Ho soggiornato in quest'hotel per un solo giorno, poiché mi hanno prenotato altrove .... E me ne pento perché sono stato meravigliosamente bene. Tutto funziona perfettamente, camere confortevoli con tutto quello che si può desiderare. Dentro e' tutto affascinante, personale gentile e molto attento ai fabbisogni . Prossimo anno mi fermerò per tutto il soggiorno perché merita veramente e poi stare su una nave ferma sul tamigi è' stupendo.
Consiglio vivamente a tutti e ci ritornerò sicuramente. Bravi ragazzi. 
Dimenticavo c'è anche personale che parla in italiano. Prezzi leggermente più bassi degli altri alberghi nei dintorni.",5,2016,01,11
119,Confortevole ,"Ci sono stata a novembre 2014.
Molto accogliente e confortevole!Suggestivo poiché è uno yacht utilizzato come hotel!
Un po' fuori mano ma vicinissimo alla metro!Il centro di Londra si raggiunge facilmente!
Buono se non si ha la necessità di tornare in hotel durante il giorno.",5,2015,12,02
119,Mal was anderes!,"Eine Hotelyacht in den Docklands von London. Ruhig gelegen trotz Stadt Flughafen. Hiervon bekommt man im Schiff nichts mit. Geräumige Kabine. Super Bett. W- LAN, großer Fernseher, Tablet im Zimmer. Geräumiges Bad. Also keine Klagen. Alles super. Zur U-Bahn nur 3min.",5,2015,10,14
119,insolita vacanza,"Venire a Londra e avere come hotel una nave sul Tamigi e' sicuramente una alternativa insolita al solito albergo. Mi sono trovata benissimo, le stanze sono spaziose e ben arredate, cosi' come tutti gli spazi comuni. Il centro di Londra e' collegato benissimo e bastano solo  15 minuti di metropolitana per arrivare alla Torre di Londra. Da consigliare",4,2015,10,04
119,Das Besondere,"Das Wichtigste zuerst: Alle Befürchtungen, dass die der Nahe Flughafen London City ein Problem ist, sind unnötig! Es ist an Bord der Sunborn nichts davon zu merken. Außer, man ist auf dem Balkon oder an Deck, natürlich. In den Kabinen hört man gar nichts. Übrigens auch nicht von anderen Gästen. 
Das Hotel ist etwas Besonderes. In den Docks gelegen, jedoch über die DLR sehr gut angebunden, ist die Sunborn eine ruhige Oase für einen London-Trip. Wir haben es für ein Wochenendbesuch genutzt und waren sehr zufrieden. Das Frühstück ist guter Standard für diese Klasse, seinen Preis wert und in jedem Fall zu empfehlen. Das Personal ist sehr freundlich. Rund um das Hotel ist recht wenig los, was jedoch eine Erholung nach einem aufregenden London-Tag sein kann. Die Emirates-Kabinenbahn ist für einen nächtlichen Ausblick auf die Skyline zu Fuß bequem zu erreichen. Einen kleinen Abzug könnte ich für die unaufgeregte Standardeinrichtung geben, aber das ist Geschmackssache.",5,2015,09,14
119,Fantastica y original opcion si vas a un congreso en el eXel,"Yate de  lujo -hotel amarrado a dos minutos del palacio de congresos EXEL  . 
Es un yate  , no un crucero , por lo que las zonas comunes no son inmensas pero las habitaciones standard son amplísimas con un baño pequeñito pero con ducha de muy aceptables dimensiones , con columna de ducha que funciona bien  y toallas supersuaves. 
Cama king size extraordinariamente comoda . 
Minibar vacio salvo dos botellas de agua de cortesía. cafetera y tetera . tabla de planchar + plancha . 
Desayuno mas que correcto , buena calidad .
Cerca del London Airport , del O2 , del Crystal  y de la Emirates line. 
Estacion de DLR ( especie de cercanías que conecta con el metro)  a metros .
Problema : si vas para turismo puro y duro no es aconsejable ya que calcular 45- 50  minutos para llegar al centro.",5,2015,06,03
119,Außergewöhnlich,"Ich war Ende April 2015 vier Nächte mit einem Freund im Sunborn Yachthotel und war sehr zufrieden. Das Hotel ist zwar nicht mitten in der Innenstadt von London, aber optimal mit öffentlichen Verkehrsmitteln zu erreichen. Der Service ist sehr persönlich und aufmerksam. Die Zimmer sind für Londoner Verhältnisse geradezu riesig. Wir hatten außerdem das Glück, einen Balkon zu haben.  
Fazit: Eine sehr coole Location mit ausgezeichnetem Service unter der Leitung vom allgegewärtigen (deutschen) Direktor Andreas Stys.",5,2015,04,30
119,Luxusjacht in London,"Das Sunborn ist für eine Städtereise die absolut empfehlenswerte Location.Die Lage auf dem Wasser ist cool. Schon bei der Ankunft ist der Anblick der Yacht, wie sie da auf dem Wasser liegt, beeindruckend. Die Innenausstattung hält, was der äußere Eindruck verspricht. Die Zimmer sind geräumig, stilvoll eingerichtet und sauber. Die Mitarbeiter schaffen mit ihrer kompetenten, sehr aufmerksamen und freundlichen Art ein tolle Wohlfühlatmosphäre. Morgens starteten wir den Tag mit einem köstlichen sehr umfangreichen Frühstücksbuffet, abends gab es den Sundowner in der entspannten Bar. Ein toller Aufenthalt, wir kommen gerne wieder!",5,2015,03,07
119,Luxusjacht in London!,"In weniger als 10 Minuten waren wir mit dem Taxt vom City Airport an der Yacht. Sehr beindruckend wenn man anreist und vor der Yacht steht. Die Mitarbeiter am Empfang waren besonders freundlich und von Beginn an fuehlten wir uns sehr wohl. 
Die Zimmer sind sehr gross und wir hatten ein Zimmer mit Balkon. Molton Brown Amenities in den Badezimmern und Duschen mit guten Wasserdruck. 
Das Fruehstueck war reichhaltig und von sehr gutter Qualitaet. Bei unserem naechsten Besuch wuerden wir gerne wieder dort wohnen.",5,2015,03,02
119,Capodanno,"Ho scelto questo albergo perché mi sembrava diverso...E mi sono sorpresa che davvero era diverso...no solo perché era una yacht,infatti dentro era meravigliosooooo...Ma anche per lo staff....ti facevano sentire unico....come forse eravamo unici turisti su questa splendida yacht...Ringrazio tantissimo Nazma,stragentile,dolcissima che ci ha accolto ed è stata sempre disponibile.....Poi parliamone x le camere....spaziose,dotate di tutto confort immaginabile.....Un posto magnifico dove ci ritornerei di sicuro",5,2015,01,10
119,Luxusjacht in London,"Der Besuch, nicht nur von London, hat sich definitiv gelohnt. Habe selten ein so gutes, freundliches und kompetentes Personal erlebt - und zwar morgens sowie abends - great! Zimmer sehr schön, sauber und geräumig. Auch gibt es im Bad genügend Ablagefächer und Handtücher - und das Badetuch ist auch eines. Jederzeit wieder und die Verbindungen nach London rein - auch kein Problem.",5,2014,12,30
119,Luxusjacht in den Docklands,"Nachdem dies unser dritter London-Besuch war, sollte es auch hoteltechnisch mal was ganz anderes werden. Das Sunborn beeindruckt schon bei der Ankunft: vorbei an London Excel, offenbart sich der erste Blick auf die Luxusjacht. Nach einem sehr freundlichen und professionellen Empfang konnten wir bereits um 12.00 unser Zimmer beziehen. Die Kabinen sind wie beworben sehr großzügig ausgelegt und edel eingerichtet. Hier volle Punkte!! Auch beim Bad gibts keine Negativpunkte, nur eine Badewanne wäre noch nett gewesen. Eine Empfehlung ist sicher das Hotel im Sommer zu wählen, da ein tolles Außendeck mit Bar vorhanden ist.
Der einzige Nachteil ist die Lage des Hotels: um seine Unterkunft zu erreichen benötigt man von den Stationen Bank oder Tower Gateway rd. 15 Minuten mit der DLR. Zu Fuß wäre es in die City zu weit, da es doch über 6 km sind und man nicht überall gehen kann. Sollte man abends mal nicht mehr in die City wollen gibts es rd. 200 m Richtung Stadtmitte einen sehr guten Libanesen; bzw. ist direkt daneben auch ein sehr gutes Cafe zum Frühstücken. 

Fazit: absolute Empfehlung wenn man mal ein etwas ""anderes"" Hotel möchte und nicht direkt in der City nächtigen muss/möchte.",4,2014,12,21
119,Grandioses und extravagantes Hotel,"Ich habe mit meiner Freundin zu ihrem Geburtstag etwas besonderes in London gesucht und ich bin froh, dass wir die auf dieser Yacht waren. Es ist ein Erlebnis, dieses beeindruckende Schiff zu sehen wenn man von der DLR Station kommt, die nur wenige Minuten enternt ist – Custom House at Excel. Wir hatten Cocktails in der Sundown Bar – just delicious, der Ausblick von der Bar ueber Canary Wharf ist fantastisch. Zum Abendessen sind wir auf der Yacht geblieben und es hat sich gelohnt. Besonders kann ich die Black Pudding Vorspeise empfehlen.

Fruehstueck am Morgen war super (und das in England!!), es gab Feta Kaese, der zu der Auswahl von Eiern koestlch geschmeckt hat. Auch sehr gut, ein Taxi zum  Flughafen zu haben, dass weniger als 10£ kostet. Im Badezimmer hatten wir Molton Brown Duschgel – super.",5,2014,12,16
119,Un hotel decisamente fuori dal comune,"Soggiornare su una nave hotel sicuramente non è da tutti giorni e l'esperienza è sicuramente fuori dal comune ed offre una valida alternativa agli hotel circostanti. Già a partire dalla sistemazione base l'hotel offre standard fuori dal comune. Ampie camere, complimentary cialde Lavazza espresso fanno da contorno ai più classici The e cioccolate. Ma la lista prosegue ed anche in bagno la qualità dei prodotti non é certo da meno. Internet ovviamente é incluso ed un bel tablet Sony Esperia fa bella mostra sul comodino. Questo é decisamente fuori dal comune per la maggior parte degli hotel. La camera, oltre che molto spaziosa é veramente comoda ed i letti ancor di più. Veniamo ora la struttura: essendo approdata da pochi mesi i servizi accessori come sauna e spa non sono pronti ma, anche a questo l'attento personale di servizio é pronto a porvi rimedio attraverso un voucher per l'ingresso alla Spa sita al Crowne Plaza a pochi metri di distanza.
Il personale é di varia nazionalità, anche italiana, ma di qualunque provenienza sia, ho riscontrato in tutti gli interlocutori grande gentilezza ed immancabile competenza. Un grazie per il breve, ma veramente piacevole, soggiorno.
Ritornerò sicuramente in questo hotel galleggiante piuttosto che soggiornare negli hotel circostanti, magari più imponenti, ma sicuramente con molta meno atmosfera.",5,2014,10,07
119,Sorprendente esperienza,"Soggiornare in questo particolare hotel è decisamente affascinante: sembra di essere sul set di un film! L'ambiente è elegante, confortevole, piacevole...soft. Le camere (che poi sono delle cabine) assolutamente silenziose e la vista esterna, che guarda il fiume,è riposante.
La colazione è varia e soddisfacente, il personale gentile e disponibile. Senz'altro da consigliare a chi cerca un luogo particolare e tranquillo dove soggiornare.
Due suggerimenti: lasciate almeno 1 plaid nelle camere (gli ospiti possono averne bisogno!) ed inoltre, cercate di sintonizzare i vostri televisori su qualche canale di altra lingua: nel mondo non si parla solo l'inglese! Cordiali saluti",4,2014,09,21
119,Sehr gute Alternative zu Hotel in der Stadt,"Mit der DLR kann man das Hotel ab City Airport mit einmal Umsteigen in 15 Minuten erreichen. Unsere beiden Zimmer konnten wir bereits um 8 Uhr am Morgen beziehen. Zimmer sauber und grosszügig. Hilfsbereites Personal. Die Lösung eines Problems mit dem Zusatzbett brauchte etwas länger, wofür uns umgehend ein Drink offeriert wurde. Das Frühstück ist sehr teuer, Alternativen gibt es in der Umgebung. Insgesamt ein positives Hotelerlebnis. ",4,2014,07,17
119,Nueva opción en Londres,"Interesante la idea de hospedarse en un yate, aunque esta ya no navega, desde la entrada sabes que estás en un yate, la decoración típica de un crucero de lujo
El hotel es prácticamente nuevo, aunque también tiene detalles por arreglar como las llaves de las habitaciones que se avería constantemente.
Ubicado muy cerca de la Arena O2 es una zona muy tranquila de Londres, Algo retirada pero ideal para conferencias.
El servicio es excelente por parte de todo el equipo de trabajo, la gente muy sonriente y amable.
Vale la pena la estancia.
A pesar de estar cerca del London City Airport no se percibe casi ningún ruido",5,2014,07,02
119,Simply awesome!,"Anläßlich eines Geschäftstermins war ich für eine Nacht im Sunborn London zu Gast. Schon wenn man auf das Schiff zuläuft gibt es eigentlich nur ein Wort das diesem Anblick gerecht wird - atemberaubend! Es ist absolut besonders und mit keinem anderen Hotel das ich kenne vergleichbar. Dieser wahnsinnige erste äußere Eindruck wurde von den Mitarbeitern bestätigt. Freundlich, hilfsbereit, kompetent und man hat gemerkt, sie sind stolz dieses spezielle Hotel zu repräsentieren. Da es ein wunderschöner Abend war und man vom Deck aus einen sensationellen Blick auf London genießen konnte, habe ich mich entschlossen an Bord auch das Abendessen einzunehmen. Und es war grandios! Auch hier, die Küche hat meine Erwartungen bei weitem übertroffen. Rundum kann man sagen, das ist einfach mal etwas anderes, unvergleichliches und ich kann einen Aufenthalt nur wärmstens empfehlen!",5,2014,06,10
