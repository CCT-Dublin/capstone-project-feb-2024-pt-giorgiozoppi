126,Great management,"The best way to evaluate a place is by visiting it multiple times, with enough intervals to appreciate the changes truly. I’ve stayed at Sofitel St James before—pre-pandemic, immediately after, last summer, and now. It’s a 5-star hotel, so expectations are always high, yet the details reveal a great deal about the quality of its management. From the inviting terrace to the immaculate appearance of the doormen and the warm atmosphere, you can sense the hotel’s meticulous management the moment you step through the door.

While the big changes are easy to spot, the subtle ones genuinely matter. Todd Debreceny, with his impressive track record, is undoubtedly an expert in his field. Words can hardly capture it; the impact of his management is felt in every corner of the hotel and each interaction with the staff. 

Thank you for the warm hospitality.",5,2024,10,12

The rooms are very comfortable and the hotel staff incredibly friendly, they have a bar that is the ideal place to enjoy the afternoon, the hotel's Wild Honey restaurant is a Michelin guide

Lovely welcoming hotel in a most convenient location kept spotless and well maintained.
Afternoon tea in the lounge was a delight thank you to the 2 ladies that work there, unlike the Ritz where it's a bit of a conveyor  belt this was run by a small team in a lovely lounge and a very personal service.
Would recommend this establishment and can't wait to return.",5,2024,09,15
126,A Perfect Day of Relaxation at Sofitel St James' Spa and Rose Room,"I had an absolutely wonderful experience at the Sofitel St James' Spa, followed by an exceptional afternoon tea in the Rose Room.

From the moment I arrived, Michaela greeted me with warmth and ensured that every aspect of my visit was perfect. My massage, delivered by the talented Jacquie, was incredibly relaxing, and afterward, I enjoyed some quiet time in the Zen room, sipping on one of the Spa's special herbal teas—a delightful touch that added to the tranquil atmosphere.

I ended my afternoon with a delectable cream tea in the elegant Rose Room, a perfect way to round off a relaxing self-care day.

I’ve been a loyal visitor of the Sofitel St James' Spa for the past 8 years, if you're looking to unwind in luxurious surroundings, I highly recommend a visit to Sofitel.",5,2024,09,13
126,"Location, Space, Style and attention to detail.","Upfront: the Sofitel St James is not a cheap stay. But the comfort, quality, location and attention to detail reconcile the rates and provide for a memorable stay. We chose the Studio Suite and given we are talking about a stay in Central London, the room was exceptionally spacious. A large entrance leads to a luxurious sitting area complete with small dining table and facilities. The bed is King sized with large side tables and the bathroom is also well sized, beautifully decorated and spotlessly clean. Windows are large and look out across Waterloo Place. Daily gifts of chocolates, biscuits and sweet treats were a welcome surprise. The breakfast is buffet as well as a 'La Carte and all options we chose were well prepared and tasty. The Restaurant area is well designed and decorated, and spacious. Staff serving breakfast were very attentive and prompt. Other than finding the Bar a little small and dark, I really cannot fault the Sofitel St James. Worth the outlay.",5,2024,09,01
126,My number choice of hotel in London.,"All staff are very well trained to privide exemplary services.   They anticipate your needs and remember what are your liked during the stay and always provided during the stay.  Front office staff, manager and duty manager have problems solving skills that give results beyond expectations
Breakfast here is one of the best varieties",5,2024,08,30
126,Is this London’s exclusive accommodation with the very best hospitality professionals?,"So, where do we start? Our arrival… Go!

As I write this I am still blown away by the warm welcome we received by Mantas and the ENTIRE concierge team.
We checked in, to be welcomed to a glass of sparkles and a side note to welcome us to Sofitel London St James. We landed into London at 6am and flew through customs and arrived much earlier than expected so we’re advised our room was not yet ready which was absolutely fine by us as we had shopping to do.

Moving on, we receive word our room was ready well ahead of the usual check in time and two ladies (Harsha and Miriam) would show us to our room. Initially we are thinking one is training the other, and also what a nice touch to be shown to the room on a personal level.
When we arrived at our door, Miriam went to open it and the eyes in the back of my head could feel Miriam grab something… a camera to capture this special moment.

Door opened and we are blown away by the level of attention and detail the room showcased. FRESH Rose petals, Champagne, decorated bed, a bath bomb, and… how’s this?!?!? Pictures taken at our wedding hanging off just married balloons. This was absolutely next level and something we will cherish forever and ever. London is the last stop of our honeymoon after exploring France and Maldives so naturally we were on a down however this moment picked us straight back up.

We cannot thank both Harsha and Miriam enough for creating this special moment we will lock in our hearts forever.

Ok back to the hotel… Sofitel London St James.. WOW is an understatement. Let’s go with elegance and sophistication. This is exactly what the hotel offers compared to another Sofitel property we stayed in only a few weeks earlier.
We felt charm, character and warmth the entire time.
The bedroom featured grand views over Pall Mall, with Sofitels amazing touches including King Size Bed, fabulous bathroom and the most amazing pillow menu to make your nights sleep as comfortable as possible.

The chief concierge and his team would always greet us upon departing and returning to the hotel as well as look after our taxi requirements.

The gym is one of the best gyms experienced in a hotel. Brand new technogym equipment including a large selection of dumbbells (upto 24kg), weight machines and cardio. The gym also included a relaxation zone and provided coconut water, protein balls and headphones. This is again next level!!! 

One additional note is to talk about the pre arrival experience which included a what’s app message asking us to check in. This is such a great concept and this channel allowed us to communicate to the staff throughout our stay.
Once we checked out we even received a message inviting us back for our first wedding anniversary next year. This is a grand example of the level of service received at this hotel. I could actually go on for hours here however there is one final point to make…

Allow me to go back to the title of this review… Does the Sofitel London St James employ only the most talented and genuine people within the industry? I am very well travelled and so excited to claim this is the case. From our welcome at the front office and guest relation staff, bar team and housekeepers. This property is certainly a STAND OUT performer within Accor and other international chains we utilise.

Sofitel London should be considered for not only any special occasion, but business trip, couples and families.

Thank you to Harsha, Miriam, Mantas, Head of Concierge and Team, Bar staff and all. You are amazing.",5,2024,08,30
126,The perfect venue for a celebratory weekend,"A memorable weekend was enhanced by our stay in this hotel.  Great location, lovely room and top class customer service all contributed to a marvellous experience.
We are regular visitors to London so have stayed all over town but will be back at the Sofitel as soon as possible.  We were made to feel very welcome throughout our stay.",5,2024,08,01
126,Great stay,"The service, location and overall experience of the hotel was top notch. We especially enjoyed the St. James Bar and the service and hospitality of the team there. Mikey the bartender made it very special with his friendliness to our family during our stay.",5,2024,07,31
126,Another excellent Sofitel,"Pros: Unique historic building, conveniently central location, top-notch room construction and design, effective air conditioning with strong air flow, 24/7 gym access, well-trained staff, quality breakfast and room service, thorough morning and evening housekeeping. Cons: Nothing of consequence, truly. Summary: This hotel is a prime example of Accor’s standard of excellence at the Sofitel level.",5,2024,07,28
126,Excellent hotel and location,"This is a fantastic hotel in what was once a bank. This was our fourth stay in 10 years. 

The rooms are classy and comfortable and well appointed. 
Hotel staff are professional and friendly. Reception and bar staff were excellent. (However I feel like the restaurant staff could have been a little warmer at breakfast). Having said that, the breakfast is excellent. 

Sofitel St James is in the perfect location to see many of the sights of London and is close to Picadilly Circus station. 

My only suggestion is to broaden the late night room service menu. Came home late from an event and there wasn’t much available to eat so we ordered two hot chocolates which were watery and not worth £15. 

Otherwise, excellent stay and we look forward to staying again.",5,2024,07,20
126,True 5 Star experience with a certain Je ne sais quoi!,"I recently stayed at the Sofitel with my wife and 8-month old and we had an all round amazing experience which completely recharged our batteries. 

Whilst the room, cleanliness, food (including breakfast) and smell (yes smell) were all amazing, I think it was the staff that make this a truly 5 star hotel. To paraphrase/borrow from Marco Pierre White, it’s the environment/service that makes a place great! We recently stayed at the Four Seasons in London and that just felt a little cold/empty with no spirit but the Sofitel St James has bags of spirit and a little je nais se quois! 
 
A true gem!",5,2024,07,19
126,Fantastic location!,"Super good located! The rooms are very cozy and the beds very comfortable! Love the bathrooms in black and white! The personal are very friendly. we have been more than once and we will repeat!
They have a gym; I have used it and although it’s not a very big one it was enough for me!",5,2024,07,16
126,Good hotel in a great location,"The hotel is good and the service is top-notch. Sometimes it can be over the top, especially when you’re tired from a long flight and the people at the reception desk want to keep on chatting with you and show you all the amenities. On the other hand, they are great people and once you’re fully rested, you can take full advantage of the hotel’s location and what they offer. The hotel is renovated quite well, but there are still things(few) that would show it’s age (built in 1923). Now, on the flip side, the breakfast was one of the best I had. Overall, I would give it 4-4.5 stars.",4,2024,07,14
126,The perfect Luxury you Deserve,"The Sofitel St. James is my favorite home away from home. From the warm welcome at check in, the personal escort to our room, with staff members explaining the many comfortable features of the elegant room and things that could be made available to enhance our stay. We utilized the breakfast served each day for a grand start to each day. Every member of the hotel staff provide the best possible assistance to make our visit perfect. From the check in  to check out 5 days later, the staff at the front door, housekeeping, turndown , and in the Wild Honey Room breakfast service world class. It is easy to see that the employees love this hotel as much as the patrons.",5,2024,07,05
126,Great hotel and amazing staff!,"The hotel is great and the service is excellent. I cannot thank the staff enough for their care and kindness.
I forgot an electronic in a nearby restaurant and only noticed in the middle of the night. They went above and beyond to help me locate it and retrieve it. 
I am so grateful and will not hesitate to come back. 
Thank you very much for your service, Sofitel St James team!",5,2024,07,03
126,Best kept secret in London; don't tell anyone,"Immaculate rooms, wonderful restaurant and caring, elegant service... what more can you ask for?  I love rediscovering this amazing hotel with its timeless elegance. 
I stayed only one night, but wished I could have stayed longer.  Truly an experience worth repeating.",5,2024,06,29
126,Top Hotel,"A fabulous hotel with an amazing staff. Location, rooms, breakfast are absolutely top but the hotel’s biggest asset are the people. At the front desk they recognized my status and gave me a warm welcome. Everyone was smiling. Housekeeping was quick and super friendly. I loved my stay there and will get back soon.",5,2024,06,28
126,Thank you Soiftel Guest Relations team!,"If you are considering staying at this hotel, definitely do it.  We just stayed for one night to celebrate my daughter’s birthday before visiting family in London.  The Sofitel guest relations team went out of their way to make our short stay special.  Besides an amazing upgrade and a happy birthday cake delivered to our room, all the staff were so welcoming and kind. We had an overnight flight from the US, although our amazing room (upgraded to a suite!) was not ready they let us use the gym facilities to freshen up (private shower and bathroom space).  Everyone was so friendly, the bartender makes amazing cocktails, delicious desserts on the menu, and the entire hotel was beautiful and clean. The location is also fantastic, we had walked everywhere! 
Thank you Sofitel Guest Relations for making our short stay wonderful- we will definitely be coming back!!",5,2024,06,20
126,"Perfect in every way, true luxury !","I am writing this review from my room (504) after spending 8 days in this room with 3 more days to go! I am in love with London and a big reason for that is our stay at Sofitel and the hospitality we have experienced at this hotel . I wish I could mention everyone’s names but from the people greeting us day in day out at the main entrance to the reception staff to the restaurant staff to the house keeping staff and the in room dining team, our experience has been phenomenal! The service is flawless and we have been spoilt rotten ! We have not heard a no as an answer for anything ! The second reason to love this hotel is the location, this place is so centrally located that for us most things have been a taxi away or a lovely walk away! The concierge desk is so helpful , they even have tickets available. For instance , our trip to Bicester village was so seamless thanks to the help we got at the concierge desk! Can go on but all I’d say is we aren’t staying anywhere else the next time we are here ! Thank you team Sofitel, you made us very happy and warm !",5,2024,06,14
126,"Excellent location, beautiful hotel, friendly staff","We had a wonderful stay at the Sofitel London St James Hotel in London.  The hotel is located within walking distance of the sites of London, shopping, restaurants, London Tube stations, and the London Bus stops.  The knowledgeable Concierge Staff will assist you with the Tube and Bus routes and taxi service.  We asked the Concierge Staff on a daily basis the best routes to get to certain locations.  
The hotel is beautifully decorated and comfortable.
The entire staff from the doorman, front desk, guest relations, concierge, housekeeping and breakfast cafe was friendly and accommodating.  
The English breakfast offered many choices and was delicious.  Every morning, we were greeted with a warm smile from Ned.  Claudia made sure we were happy with our breakfast order.  When we had early morning excursions and unable to sit down for breakfast, the staff provided take out bags for us.  
We would definitely stay at this beautiful hotel again in the future.",5,2024,06,08

Jeff the concierge answered all our questions nicely, in French in style 
Rika explained to us the history about the hotel, a former Loyd bank, beautiful building indeed, and took us to our bedroom (luxury room twin beds)
Nicely decorated Paul Smith touch, very comfy bed and a stylish bathroom with Dyptique products 
Rika asked us if we booked for a special occasion, as it was my friend’s 60th birthday, we got 2 glasses of Champagne (or sparkling tea)
The nice surprise was when we got back in the evening, a delicious birthday cake was display in our room with a birthday card and Sofitel scented candles.

I've often found service lacking in European hotels (sorry, but true), especially when compared to Asia but the Sofitel St James is like home from home, with the best service around!

We will definitely be back.",5,2024,05,05
126,Bad weekend to stay at this overpriced hotel,"My entire interaction with this hotel got off to a bad start. As it was the London Marathon the weekend that I wanted to stay there (which I have no interest in) the hotel deemed it appropriate to raise prices by more than 45%. I was initially offered a Superior Room for £1,232 for 2 nights for the weekend - the following weekend the same room was available for £847. That's excluding breakfast. However, as this was the weekend of my wife's birthday & our wedding anniversary, in a central location where we already had numerous arrangements & after many rounds of time-consuming negotiation, a price of £950 was agreed. Still £100 above what one would deem to be the 'normal' rate. 
The room itself, 420, was tiny & very poorly laid out. Where to begin.
1) there was a very big TV but no way to plug one's own HDMI cable into it as is was affixed so close to the wall that it was impossible to get into the back
2) the TV was so big that there was no place for a mirror
3) there was no decent sized desk to put one's laptop & anything else on. It was also positioned right in front of the TV. So if you wanted to do any work, one was in the way of the TV. 
4) there was no dressing table in addition to no mirror
5) the way that wall should have been laid out was, the fridge & the tea/coffee-making facilities should have been closer to the end.
6) A much larger desk area should have been in place, which could double up as a dressing table. The dressing table should have a mirror and the TV didn't need to be as big for the size of room.
7) The wardrobe was way too big as well & absolutely filthy up top. I was going to put my bag on top of the wardrobe (to give me more space in the room) but when I saw how much dirt & dust there was on top of the wardrobe I decided otherwise. 
8) There was no view. The room faced the back & inwards - the main view was of a crane.
9) I will say that one of the staff on reception, Jasmine, was very attentive",2,2024,04,28
126,The best and most memorable hotel experience I’ve ever had in all of my travels.It exceeded my expectations.,Everything was perfect. It was the best and most memorable hotel stay I’ve ever had in all of my travels.One thing that stood out the most was that we were checked in way much  earlier than the regular check in time.I truly will come back in the future.,5,2024,04,18
126,Great Place to stay in London,"Service is excellent, Rooms are great & the Location is as good as it gets. Pret - Groceries - Theatres all located close by.

126,Birthday treat,"We've stayed at The Sofitel St James a few times, and have always left feeling that we've been well looked after. So, as we were going to see The Phantom of the Opera for my wife's 60th birthday, we decided we would stay there again, for two nights this time.
Having mentioned it was my wife's birthday, the staff were determined to make it as enjoyable as possible for here - we got champagne on arrival, a ""happy birthday"" dessert in the restaurant, and a small (but delicious) chocolate cake was left in the room when we were out. Luckily for me, there were two knives and forks so I got to enjoy a piece!
As usual, the room was lovely, with an extremely comfortable bed and soft pillows. We slept exceedingly well. Breakfast was plentiful and varied, and set us up for a day round the city.
Yet again - well looked after, and looking forward to our next visit.",5,2024,04,09

Great location to walk around and sightsee while feeling safe. The rooms were decorated nicely, they felt like a luxury hotel (which it is of course)The beds, pillows and comforters felt very relaxing, especially after a long day around London. After one of our day's out we were pleasantly surprised to return to a little surprise for each our daughter's to celebrate their birthday. It was very thoughtful and sweet, it made them feel special and put a big smile on their faces. I would like to thank the staff for that, and say we will be back again soon. I will be recommending this hotel to everyone who is visiting London.",5,2024,04,02
126,Unbelievable experience and customer service!,"I can not compliment this hotel enough!  The entire staff is clearly dedicated to ensuring your stay is flawless and as enjoyable as possible.  Rika, the guest services coordinator was amazing.  Every single aspect from front staff (check in), bar and restaurant staff, greeters, concierge and housekeeping was some of the best I have ever received.  Clearly this hotel's staff works as a team and is proud of their customer service.  I would not stay anywhere but here if/when I return to London.  Any questions we had about where to go, what to eat, how to get there was not only answered but then facilitated by the staff.  They were amazing.  

The rooms were well laid out, bathrooms as well.  Wifi was a little spotty in the rooms, but excellent in the lobby.  The bar was top notch with servers and bartenders willing to discuss drinks and spirits when questions were asked.  

Your greeters were such a happy sight to see when we returned back to the hotel or left.  They ensured we had taxi's ready if needed and an umbrella if rain would occur.  

Your restaurant staff was also top notch.  The manager ensured we had everything we wanted or desired even when we had a tour that left prior to the breakfast service. She prepared a to go bag and coffee's for our group to take with us. 

Your staff made our visit incredible.  I can't thank you enough and will brag about you to anyone who asks about staying in London!",5,2024,03,29
126,Sofitel Best in London,"The Sofetil St James was an amazing hotel and location to all the great sites in London.

The staff was very friendly and accommodating to all our needs. The room was well decorated very clean, and spacious. 

Perfect location for anyone who is a first time visitor to London due to its location. Several places to have dinner around the hotel not to mention the hotel bar and restaurant which are both top notch. 

I e stayed in several hotels in London and so far this was the best. 

Truly a 5 Star hotel! 

Thank you to all the staff who made out stay so GREAT!

126,Out best hotel experience so far,"We enjoyed an extented weekend at Sofitel London St James, and we were very impressed with the experience. First of all, the hotel is gorgeous, especially the stunning lobby! The building is also very well maintained. E.g. the walls in our room looked like they had just been painted. The room itself was beautifully decorated and very clean. What we loved the most though was the staff. We really felt pampered throughout our stay: in the lobby, in our room, at breakfast and at dinner. We felt that it mattered that we were there, and that made all the difference compared to a hotel were the rooms are cheaper and the service is less cohesive. Also the food at Sofitel St James was delicious. We really enjoyed the breakfast because it offered a lot of variety and value for money, and the dinner was top-notch with great portions and excellent wine recommendations. This was hospitality at its best and therefore our best hotel experience in London so far. The first one was almost 20 years ago, so we've seen a lot. Now we finally have a place to return to.",5,2024,03,20
126,A delightful stay in St. James’s.,"Service was first class and unobtrusive. The room was very comfortable, well acclimated and tranquil. The Gym was modern and well equipped. Staff reception was welcoming and efficient but not overbearing. The ambience of the hotel was modern but not imposing.",5,2024,03,19
126,Perfect,An amazing experience at Sofitel Saint James! The staff was outstanding and the hotel’s location was superb. We are grateful for the exceptional service and warmth we experienced during our stay. We’ll definitely return on our next visits to London!,5,2024,03,15
126,They should write the book on customer service,"I was there in late February with my wife for a few nights. The location of the hotel is perfectly located between Buckingham Palace and Piccadilly Square. There are great restaurants in the area, all in short walking distance as well as shopping and entertainment. The rooms were manicured, clean and well appointed. My wife and I travel quite often and were quite impressed with the level of customer service from all of the staff, from the concierge who made all of our last minute restaurant reservations, to the door men who greeted us by our name with a smile and were amazing gentlemen. Christina who works in hospitality left us handwritten notes in our room, very pleasant young lady. Overall, we appreciated such great customer service, and can't wait to return. Btw, the food was very good at the hotel too.",5,2024,03,09
126,Wonderful stay!,I had a wonderful stay at Sofitel with my parents. The room & bathroom were very spacious and clean. All the staff were super nice as well. We really enjoyed breakfast our last day. Products tasted very fresh and everything was well presented. The spa was relaxing. We finished our stay with a nice drink in the bar. Would definitely recommend to stay here!,5,2024,03,05
126,Fabulous Hotel,Fabulous hotel. The staff are very friendly & professional. Lovely bedroom & beautifully decorated. The St James Bar has a lovely atmosphere. Great selection for breakfast & excellent service by a waiter called Lois. We will definitely stay again.,5,2024,03,04
126,The Only Hotel I Will Ever Use Again In London,"This hotel experience was by far the best ever. We've had luxury experiences before, including the top penthouse suite at the Bellagio Hotel in Las Vegas but the treatment we received here was simply unmatched. The reception we received the moment we walked in with Ornella, Violeta, Adela, Rika, Christina, a gentleman from Spain/Columbia can't remember his name, and Matthias made us feel like royalty. They all listened intently to our responses to their gentle questions about our stay, our wishes and our plans and did whatever they could to accommodate us. 
Next, the concierge staff that was led by Giomaria, (Another gentleman from Hungary, cannot remember his name), Na Jib, and Abrajaim, was so very helpful from suggesting itineraries to mapping out our journeys. Our stay would have been completely different without the people mentioned above over the course of 5 days.
The restaurant staff again, was incredible including Panos, Tina, Luis from Spain, another Luis and two lovely ladies from India. They sat us down and made sure we were happy with our table, brought us anything we wanted and made sure our order was 100% correct.
Again, this was the most professional, the most proud and the most helpful staff I've ever had and I have traveled and stayed at many hotels over the course of many years.
The room amenities were top notch from the bedding to the way the room was prepared for us every day. Everything was cleaned perfectly, the bath and shower were totally satisfying and on top of everything else, the location was beyond what I was expecting. We were walking distance from at least two theaters, the king's residence, the prime minister's residence, lovely walks, historical sites and the list goes on and on.
I will always return to this hotel or I won't travel to London England, period. 
Thank you everybody,

126,Amazing service and wonderful hotel and location,"Amazing service from all teams in this beautiful hotel, from.the Concierge and front of house greeting, through to bar and restaurant staff. Nothing is too difficult, friendly approach, so helpful and go above and beyond. The food and drinks were wonderful, very comfortable and clean rooms with plenty of space even for standard rooms selected. 
Love the breakfast honey from their own bees on the roof too. 
You can spend less on stays but servide we've found is noticeably less. This hotel feels like you have benefitted from a huge discount on one of the even more expensive hotels!! 5 star! Oh, and a great location!",5,2024,02,25
126,4 Perfect Nights in London,"Beautiful hotel with a fun history. Beautiful room with amazingly comfy beds. But the best was the service, particularly from Violetta who went out of her way to make me and my two sons feel  like VIPs. Love that the hotel had very tasty vegan options (London is so so vegan-friendly), and the location can’t be beat. An easy stroll or train to every major attraction and cool neighborhood. Thanks Sofitel, we’ll be back!",5,2024,02,23
126,Stay here while you’re in London!,"We stayed at the Sofitel St James for a couple of days for a quick visit to London. I highly recommend this hotel for its warm, welcoming staff, excellent location, and fantastic rooms. 

It’s within walking distance of Soho,high-end shopping, and most of London’s famous landmarks. 

Thanks, Camille and Raschely for an extraordinary welcome - you made us both feel special 😊",5,2024,02,19
126,Perfect location and outstanding service!,"We had a fabulous stay at the Sofitel London St James.
Actually, at first I met some terrible booking troubles that made me very disappointed, but when we arrived at Sofitel St James, all our discomfort flew away. A special “thanks” to Monsieur Mathijs Janssen who gave us warm welcome and help. The signature tea tasted so good! Merci beaucoup!
Every staff were outstanding that made me feel cared for.
The location is perfect which is just 1 minute away from His Majesty’s Theatre where we watched the musical twice and it’s also very close to Piccadilly Circus and Covent Garden.
The Wild Honey St James was lovely as well. We went for a Pre-Theatre dinner and had a wonderful time.
Hope to return Sofitel London St James there again!",5,2024,02,17
126,Fabulous from start to finish!,"What an amazing experience! We chose to stay here as a treat for our anniversary, and we're so happy we did! From check in to check out everything was perfect! 
I only wish we could have stayed longer! 
The room was well equipped and beautifully decorated, I had the best nights sleep! We didn't dine or have breakfast, but I'd love to next time we visit!",5,2024,02,16
126,The perfect Sofitel Hotel to stay in London,"Perfect location, staff professional and very kind, clean and organised.  
The Undergroung (Metro station) is less than 100m. Everything in the hotel is thought to provide a good staying for the hostages. The bar and the restaurant inide is very useful to have a meal. The staff team is well prepared and very polite.",5,2024,02,14
126,A consistently great experience,"We first stayed here in 2007 and it instantly became our favorite London hotel. It is close to Piccadilly Circus and Leicester Square/Covent Garden, but it is just a couple of blocks removed so that it is much more quiet than those areas. Each stay here has been extremely quiet, which helps if one is getting over jet lag. The rooms are very nice.

Our April 2023 visit (actually two visits, separated by a trip to Paris) were just as good as the others. The service is always great.

At the end of an evening we always enjoy having a drink in their cozy bar. 

It may be a little more expensive than some other London hotels, but it is worth every penny.",5,2024,02,06
126,World class cocktails,"I have just had the most perfect stay in the St James Sofitel. The room was modern and luxurious, but also felt homely. I stayed on the 6th floor and although I’m from the UK and have been to London loads of times, the room view of the London landmarks was stunningly impressive. The Sofitel beds are always so comfortable; I had a great nights sleep.

As a sole, female travellor, sometimes hotels can be a little intimidating. But during my stay the staff were naturally friendly and attentive and put me at ease. The level of service was impressive and led to me feeling relaxed about using the facilities. I braved the cocktail bar alone and I’m so glad I did. Amazing staff…and the cocktails really are top class. It was such a great and unique experience.

For me it wasn’t just a bed for the night on a weekend break in London, the stay became the main focus for me. I enjoyed every second. So much so I dropped what I had gone to London for, in favour of a lie in and a leisurely breakfast.",5,2024,02,03
126,Outstanding service as always,"We love this hotel - it’s expensive but the only place in London we’d consider for a special occasion. The staff are outstanding and the service flawless, as a guest you always feel very welcome and cared for on a personal level. The room we had (luxury) was extremely quiet and comfortable, it’s a historic building so rooms vary a lot in size and design even in the same price category. Our bathroom this time was a bit cramped but the main room was very spacious and impeccably decorated. Breakfast was very good, if not as lavish as pre-pandemic sadly. There’s a lovely tea salon although they need to put a few more spoonfuls of tea in the pot! The cocktail bar mixes the best drinks. Had a fabulous stay and hopefully will return before too long.",5,2024,01,29
126,"Great Location, Fantastic Service","Location, location, location.  What a great spot for a few quick days in London.  Room was excellent and the decor was fresh, with everything catered for.  Service was excellent.  A special “shout out” to Luis who went above and beyond to make us comfortable when we arrived for breakfast after a 14 hour flight, he backed up for the rest of the stay making our brekkie a special start to the day.  Thank you…",5,2024,01,25
126,Just perfect!  Can't fault anything,"Can't fault it!
We have just come back from a wonderful trip overseas which included 6 days in London.  Always knew we would be safe booking a Sofitel; however weren't prepared for how perfect London St James is/was.  
Location couldn't be faulted; service from the minute we walked in the door until the day we left, was next to none - Reception, Concierge, Rose Room, Housekeeping, Restaurant, Management - they were all amazing and made us feel like we were their only guests.  
The rooms were beautiful and extremely clean and comfortable.  The daily treats and turndown service were the icing on the cake.
I truly hope to return there one day to experience this again.",5,2024,01,09
126,This is real 5 stars!,"We were regular guests at the Sofitel St.James until the pandemic.

This year was our first visit since then, and I have to say: nothing has changed! For us as Gold members, it is still the best Sofitel in the world. 5 stars from arrival to departure. Every single team member gave their maximum to ensure we had a truly 5-star stay. Our suite in room 505 was amazing.

We would especially like to thank the bar team, and especially the employee from Greece and the team from Italy.

Thank you, Sofitel!",5,2024,01,01
126,Simply the BEST,"The Sofitel in St James is a stunning hotel in a superb location. It offers impeccable service, spotless room and first class food. Nothing is too much trouble and it’s nice when the staff use your name. The spa is worth a visit too. I have stayed in many hotels and the Sofitel is simply the best. A big thanks to everyone who made it the best Christmas ever.",5,2024,01,01
126,Phenomenal,"Staff, cleanliness, design, quality of service on the highest hospitality level. Perfect location that is in walking distance to the bustling heart of London but quiet at the same time. St James Park for a morning run and access to the London public transport are right around the corner to make the most of your time. During Christmas period hot chocolate and mulled wine are served within the palatial lobby area to get into festive mood. The hotelbar is the best in London and the barkeepers have the ability to make every guest feel special at any time.
A special thanks to Violeta, who has made our stay unforgettable with her inviting, super-professional and kind way of welcoming us to the hotel and making sure my partner experiences a wonderful birthday!",5,2023,12,31
126,Had a very enjoyable stay,"Excellent housekeeping quiet and so efficient 
Also the restaurant was great
The staff took good care of us especially luis 
Impressive! 
Also concierge was very helpful . The hotel is centrally located and it’s very easy go on short walks around central London from here",5,2023,12,28
126,"Excellent, Superb Spa Disappointing food for 5star","We were treated to a spa and lunch experience today as a Christmas present from our son. 
The spa treatment was quite exceptional and the masseurs were the best my wife had Sofie whilst I had  Jackie  whose was brilliant. 
Sadly the lunch, perhaps being part of a package, was disappointing for such an establishment. 
My Truffle Starter was served on a cold plate which diminishes the enjoyment of a dish  that was very tasty. My wife’s ‘ starter was Salmon and was excellent as was her Caesar salad. 
My St James burger was sent back as too cold to enjoy again on a cold plate. It was replaced with slightly warmer but was not of the 5 star quality expected. 
Was it because it was a package as if so the Spa was clearly outshining the food. 
Whilst I would readily return for the Spa Experience I could not recommend the food.",4,2023,12,22
126,Pre-Christmas family stay,"Had a wonderful pre-Christmas stay with the family at the Sofitel St James. The staff are all very friendly, courteous and helpful. Lovely comfortable hotel, excellent food and a great bar. Perfect location for shopping.",5,2023,12,21
126,A MUST STAY IN LONDON,"Hotel was beautiful!   Staff was wonderful and overly accomodating. Staff goes out of the way to meet your every need.   Rooms are terrific- sleek, modern with lots of amenities.   Location is perfect.  Walking distance to many ""go to"" sites.   Breakfast buffet is huge and has everything you could possibly want.  Hotel Manager,  Marie-Paule Nowlis was lovely and very helpful.  Top notch in every way.",5,2023,12,16
126,Perfect stay,"My entire stay at the hotel was perfect and I was treated excellent at all times.
I recommend the hotel in every way, for the attention, location and level of service.
I hope to visit the hotel again soon.",5,2023,12,15
126,"The cosiest hotel, particularly around Christmas time",Rooms on 2nd floor (Waterloo Place/Pall Mall) are extremely light due to the tall windows. Beds are the best I've ever slept in. This hotel is a wonderfully intimate affair. Coming here is like slipping into the comfiest pair of slippers you'll ever find!,5,2023,12,14
126,Great Location with Wonderful Rooms and a Superior Staff,"We had never stayed at the Sofitel London St. James before, but we certainly will the next time we are in London.  The hotel’s location is spectacular—convenient for walking or taking public transit to anything in the city, near two of the city’s great parks (St. James and Green), two blocks away from two great streets (Piccadilly and Regent), and a short walk from the West End theatres, not to mention great restaurants nearby.  The rooms are good size for London and nicely appointed.  The staff is outstanding—most recognized and call us by name within a day after we arrived.  And the small touches—hot chocolate or mulled wine late in the afternoon in the lobby for the holidays, for example—are unique among the larger hotels.  We have stayed in many London hotels, and the Sofitel is among the best.",5,2023,12,11
126,Great location and excellent service,"A very nice hotel centrally located just a couple of block down from Piccadilly Circus. A luxury hotel that did not disappoint in any way, and the most excellent was the great friendly and service-oriented staff in all functions from reception, concierge to restaurant. Great in-house restaurant, where both breakfast and lunch was great (we did not test the dinner, but with one Michelin star, we are sure it also is good).Room was also nice and well equipped. A very nice December week end.",5,2023,12,10
126,Fabulous! Look no further!,"Best location, greatest staff, yummiest breakfast buffet/bar AND menu! Great coffee. Rooms very nice and clean with Armoire style closets and large bathrooms with tub and separate shower. Great sink space with storage shelf underneath! SMEG hot water pot and evening tea and cups provided. Rose Tea Room isn't just for tea but it sure is beautiful. Lovely lobby. Bar just off lobby area. We were there last week of November, the decorating with trees etc was great. The following week there were going to be daily festivities.  LOVE THIS PLACE look no further.  Walk or take a bus or car anywhere. You are within walking distance to great shopping, restaurants and sights. The outdoor Christmas lights were also amazing. It was definitely tough to leave this all behind.  Hope to be bavck sooner than later.",5,2023,12,09
126,"Great location, excellent service.",Excellent location with an extremely attentive level of service. We have stayed several times and will continue to use the hotel in the future. The fact that it is not enormous provides an additional level of charm. I would thoroughly recommend. ,5,2023,12,02
126,Beautiful on the inside and out!,"What a great place to stay! The Sofitel in London was fabulous! The service was fantastic, the rooms were beautiful, the staff were so friendly and helpful. They went above and beyond with personal touches: a special dessert and note on Thanksgiving day for this American, for example. It was quiet, not too big, and great location. I can’t recommend it enough. ",5,2023,12,01
126,Beautiful Hotel with amazing location,"We loved our stay at this marvelous hotel. You can't beat the location to go walking all around, the outside and inside of the hotel is beautiful and very well kept. Loved our room with black piano finish doors and bathroom with double french doors, the smell of the corridors amazing. The breakfast was delicious. The tea room looks like it was taken out of a movie, the bar, formal and elegant, the service impecable. Would come back again and again.",5,2023,11,29
126,A gem in London,"An amazing, personal customer service. The room was very comfortable. As it was my husband birthday, we had a special cake and card in the room. The lobby was beautifully decorated and had a Christmas feel.  ",5,2023,11,28
126,Relaxing Luxury,"We've stayed several times in this hotel & it never disappoints. Great location, luxurious relaxing surroundings & the staff are marvellous. They are professional, warm , friendly & attentive. 
Excellent food. Plenty of choice  from the buffet at breakfast & hot breakfasts can be ordered.
Wonderful Michelin starred dining in the evening at Wild Honey where the dishes are inspired & good portions. The sirloin of beef for 2 with shepherds pie was tasty & filling. I love the caneles they serve with the coffee. They are yummy.
Look forward to making a return visit.

126,Luxurious stay,"Great experience from check in to check out. Personnel at front desk was above expectations arranging a very welcomed early check in after a long haul flight.

126,Favorite Hotel,"Sofitel is a true luxury hotel. My husband and I went recently for our anniversary and it was so perfect. Pillows, bedding and slippers were so nice.  They also offer laundry and dry cleaning services.  Breakfast was always delicious- especially the muesli and juices! The jacuzzi room was complimentary and the Rose Lounge was so classy for cream tea.  We were SO IMPRESSED by the room service, and multiple times a day there was the option for someone to refresh our room, bring water/tea/snacks.  We truly felt they cared about our experience and were checking in on us frequently, very prompt to fulfill our every request.  The gym is also extremely nice- with a jacuzzi shower, vibration bed, amenities, water, apples, coconut water, even earphones and scented cold towels.

Special thanks to Yee Ki at the front desk, Rodrigo at the entrance and Nadjib for his luggage services and for making us feel so welcome.  These three employees as well as Luis at breakfast really are what Sofitel is all about: luxury customer service!  Thank you all so much for making our anniversary so perfect.",5,2023,10,31

Year on year the hotel grows in service and stature

A relaxing , home from home , in London",5,2023,10,30
126,Expensive but perfectly located hotel,"Right in the heart of historic London, minutes from the Mall and Buckingham Palace you’d expect this chain hotel to be pricey, and it is. Beautiful reception with elegant, high end check in staff who accompany you to the rooms, which are elegant spacious spaces behind shiny enamel black doors. 
Nespresso machine and the usual tea coffee making accoutrements, with surprising low end hotel touch lack of sufficient milk cartons. So you’d better like black coffee. 
Clean and chic room but ours backed on to an ugly utility system courtyard, which despite double glazing emitted a highly intrusive low frequency noise every minute from 5am to 7am keeping us both awake. 
Excellent service when we requested non feather pillows, delivered to room in five minutes. 
Mini bar and room service prices verging on hilarity. £35 for an English breakfast and £18 for a Negroni! Someone back at Sofitel HQ is having the best laugh making this stuff up. 
However, you stay at a high end hotel you brace yourself for such nonsense . There’s a Pret across the road. 
It delivers as expected.",4,2023,10,30
126,The Ideal Hotel Brand,"My husband and I are loyal customers to Sofitel. They really have won us over with their various locations: a true customer first brand from a bygone era (we are in our 20s), with top quality spa, amenities, gym, room service, everything. This hotel is ideally located for everything London. The breakfast is always fantastic with the most customer-oriented employees. Luis at the breakfast really represents everything Sofitel is known for: attentive, thoughtful customer service in an ideal environment. Very kind as well. Breakfast is delicious with wonderful new juices each day, wonderful hot selection and perfect pastries. The spa is also ideal.",5,2023,10,27

Great restaurant and bar - the breakfast is really good.  But what makes this hotel a cut above others is the genuine, professional service provided by the whole team. From reception, to the door, from the friendly good mornings of the housekeeping team to the hospitality of the wait staff, this is a team that seems passionate about what they do.

126,6 STARS IF THAT WAS POSSIBLE,"The Hotel is a gem.  The staff is amazing.   Attention to detail  was consistent during our entire stay at the hotel.   The rooms were always immaculate and the service impeccable.    

The 1st night we went to the hotel’s Wild Honey restaurant.   Amazing as well.  The food was delicious and the service was outstanding.  Vicky our hostess was a delight.   When we had dessert she recommended that we try the coconut cappuccino.  Delicious.  Thank you for your excellent service.   And Joan, thank you as well for your open and welcoming personality.  I could continue to name staff members but all went above and beyond to make our stay memorable.   

We have stayed at the Sofitel before and whenever we have a chance to visit London again, we will once again return to the Sofitel St James.   To us it is the only place in London to stay.   Thank you all. ",5,2023,10,13

126,Too Short of a Stay,"Unfortunately, I stayed at the property for one-night but nothing short of a great stay. The location was prime, close to shopping and restaurant/bars. I did not get the opportunity to dine at their Michelin star restaurant as it was a bit late for dinner, but I did grab some bites and amazing cocktails at the bar. Everyone is so warm and welcoming. One of my favortie Sofitels. ",5,2023,09,27

126,The AC did not work,"We stayed here for one night on our stopover and enjoyed everything except in the middle of the night the AC did not work.  After tolerating this for awhile we called and were told the system had a fault and could not be fixed.
We understand things break...But then expected the staff to do the right thing and offer a credit, or a free breakfast. Something. But nothing was.
Very disappointing.",3,2023,09,21
126,Best place to stay,"Greetings: the moment you step out of the taxi from the concierge greetings all the way to the reception, you feel that you have arrived to the right place that makes you feel at home. Every time I travel to the Uk, Sofitel is my pit stop before returning home.
Location: it’s prime location makes it easy for me to do my last minute shopping…Covent Garden is 10 min away walk, Trafalgar Square, Soho, Piccadilly Circus is 4 min away as well as the tube, Regent street bond street approximately 6 to 8 min away. 

Service: concierge service is top.
Rooms are clean and the smell of the hotel is just amazing and relaxing, that I bought their Room mist to take home. 
Check in check out was very easy. 
It takes 45 min to reach the airport by taxi depending on traffic.",5,2023,09,21
126,One of the best hotels in London,"Sofitel vastly exceeded my expectations. Excellent staff, large room by London standards, felt newly refurbished, and an incredibly comfortable bed. I’ve stayed at many of the top hotels in London and the Sofitel deserves a spot near the top of the list. ",5,2023,09,21
126,5 star luxury,"We got married at Sofitel and spent two nights in their suite. Most personalised stay I have had in the UK. Really felt like Sofitel were trying to spoil us with so many complimentary and personalised gifts - with hand written notes and a personalised drawing of my husband and I in front of the hotel! 
Sofitel is faultless. All staff are so friendly and attentive. The rooms are comfortable. Breakfast was lovely. The lobby and rooms smell amazing! Sofitel have their own personal scent, which they also kindly gifted to us in a diffuser! Not to mention the location is absolutely iconic, just down the road from Piccadilly circus. You could not get a better location for a London getaway. ",5,2023,09,20
126,Another Incredible Stay in St. James Area - Easy Walking to other areas,"This was our second visit to London and we stayed at the Sofitel St. James for a second time and it did not disappoint.  I truly appreciated the team reaching out to us in advance of our stay, to check-in to see if we needed anything before arrival, to understand the purpose of our trip and for setting up a nice welcome gift upon arrival. The room was magnificent and always kept clean.  The housekeeping team did an incredible job, never missing  a beat, even with turn down service every night.Our bartender Christo at the St. James bar - was such a treat! He is a fantastic mixologist who really knows his spirits, cool trends - and made a fantastic classic daiquiri and sazerac - also super fun to chat with. 

The hotel itself is within easy walking distance to Soho, Convent Gardens, Mayfair.

The concierge team was also super helpful with reservations on demand, booking taxis - and overall made things very easy for us.

I would definitely stay here if ever in London again!

",5,2023,09,16
126,Nice hotel nice location nice people,"As for all Sofitel, great bed + a touch of British style with the team room inside the hotel. I am not a fan of the new decoration (too modern for me in a house with character) but I will continue to stay at St James as I am a fan of it. ",4,2023,09,14
126,Great hotel with great employees,We had the best stay of our trip at this hotel.  Mantas was wonderful and it seemed like he really cared about us.  I loved the text messages from him asking if everything was going great with us.  The breakfast was great as well as the room.  Beds were really comfortable.  I really liked having the bathtub as I filled it with hot water and soap and soaked my aching feet in it.  I would stay here again.  ,5,2023,09,13
126,A special weekend ,"Our visit was to celebrate family anniversary and birthday the rooms were scrupulously clean and the beds so comfortable the house keeper’s are to be applauded, and the breakfast team were magnificent ",5,2023,09,12
126,High class London with a French twist,"From arrival I felt like all my wishes were catered for, with a friendly yet professional focus on personal detail. The bar and restaurant are superb.
Somehow the beds are always the best to sleep in. Love location in between leafy parks and bustling culture.",5,2023,09,12
126,"Sadly for a 5 Star, massively let themselves down","The hotel is lovely, however after have been lucky enough to have experienced other 5 star hotels (see my other reviews) they have let themselves down.

The rooms are amazingly comfy with plush bedding and very comfy, the bathrooms are spacious and showers are amazing as you would expect from any top end hotel.

However, there is no where for anyone to do their makeup and hair where there is good lighting and a mirror, which is a common issue at lots of hotels so my wife had to drag a chair to the mirror with half decent lighting

The main issues were for two days there was a coffee cup missing which we had to report to reception. Not a big thing but in a 5 star hotel, it’s the little things that make the difference 

The other thing, on our 2nd evening we took drinks back to our room, on returning after the day out the following day, the dirty glasses had been placed with the coffee cups, they still had old wedges of lime in them, we didn’t report it to reception but, leaving dirty glasses in the rooms for any hotel is simply un-acceptable,  what levels of checking and quality control are being done.

Breakfast, only time we ate breakfast at the hotel, on our last  morning was lovely and piping hot, however tables that came in and ordered after us were brought coffee and their food before us and we had to ask twice for the coffee and again to find out where our food was

Yes perhaps over critical but for the amount we paid for the 3 nights stay in a hotel that their own website describes as:

“The 5-star Sofitel London St James hotel is a magnificent example of neoclassical architecture in the heart of London.”

I think the little things have massively let them down",3,2023,09,10
126,Great drinks and food,"Mario at the hotel bar was wonderful- very welcoming, willing to share insider tips on cocktail recipes, and he makes an excellent “Perfect Manhattan”! The bar has a cosy and elegant vibe, great to get a drink or two. Don’t miss booking dinner at Wild Honey just beyond the curtain!",5,2023,09,02
126,Fantastic hotel and location.,"Superb service, quiet rooms, lovely atmosphere.  Luxurious amenities and an excellent location.   All the main attractions in London are in walking distance.  The food and drinks selection and standard was top notch.  Would stay here again in a heart beat! ",5,2023,08,21
126,Heart in the heat of London!,"The experience at the St James has hands down been one of the best hotel experiences ever!  The welcome from the staff was like being invited into someone’s home.  The explanation of the hotel facilities as well as assistance from staff along the way was amazing.  
The bed and ammenities were great for our holiday experience and we had the opportunity to ensure the Spa which was also and incredible experience.  

Thank you to all the team who were involved with your stay! ",5,2023,08,13
126,Excellence in the heart of London,"An excellent hotel at a good location. The rooms are nice and clean and the amenities good. 
The concierges are better than I have met anywhere. The personnel at the reception desk, housekeeping and the restaurant are outstanding. They provide efficient service with great courtesy. The food is good and the staff are always willing to make accommodations for your special needs.
I cannot think of staying anywhere else when in London.",5,2023,08,12

126,A must when in London,"We had an incredible stay at Sofitel London, where every aspect radiated warmth and luxury. The impeccable service led by one of their managers Mathijs Janssen truly set this hotel apart. His and the Sofitel families genuine care and attention to detail made us feel like a cherished guest. The elegantly appointed rooms, delectable dining options, and attentive staff created a remarkable experience. Mathijs went above and beyond to ensure our comfort, making our stay unforgettable. I wholeheartedly recommend Sofitel London to anyone seeking an exceptional getaway, where every moment is infused with a sense of genuine hospitality and sophistication. We can’t wait to return. 
Thank you for making our stay at Sofitel London so incredible, Deb and Pete.",5,2023,08,08

The staff are great …. housekeeping, bar staff, concierge, reception, restaurant, managers, etc.  All welcoming and helpful.",5,2023,07,30
126,Missing item in the hotel,"After i check out. I forgot my earrings in the room. And as they told me no guest stay in that room after i left. But my item still gone. I already called hotel and email them but all they said is they doesn’t know they couldn’t find it, and i they just sorry about that. I can not accept this when i stay in the 5 stars hotel and someone just stealing my stuff and hotel have no responsibility about this.",1,2023,07,24
126,Stay in the hear of London!,"Sofitel London St James is in a fantastic location in the heart of London! A hop, skip and a jump to Piccadilly Underground and a short walking distance to Pall Mall, Buckingham Palace, Trafalgar Square and Big Ben! The staff are all very professional and courteous and always greeted me with a smile each day. The onsite bar and restaurant were fantastic and the in-room dining menu offered many delicious options! It was my 'home away from home' for a 12-night business stay and I enjoyed every minute of it! If my travel budget allows, I will return! Thank you!",5,2023,07,23
126,Excellent hotel,"Not cheap, but a really good hotel in a fantastic location in London. Minutes to Trafalgar Square, Leicester Square, Chinatown and Soho. Service at the hotel absolutely first class and rooms really nice (albeit relatively small as is the norm in London). We will definitely stay again",5,2023,07,18
126,simply first class,I stay at this hotel when in London and the service is always first class.  From the moment you walk in the door they make you feel welcome and the service is unrivalled.  Can't recommend this place highly enough,5,2023,07,17
126,Consistently excellent in every way.,"I've lost track of how many times I've stayed at this excellent hotel, and it never, ever fails to impress. Location. Staff. Comfort in the room. Breakfast. The bar. All top notch from my point of view.

The breakfast was amazing, and the level of service in the restaurant was beyond compare. I have stayed at many of the five star hotels down in the St. James and Hyde Park area, and this by far is the best experience out of all of them.",5,2023,06,23
126,Great Spa - Rude Chef,Had a great day in the Spa. Lovely massage and facial. Lunch was delicious in Wild Honey restaurant. This would be a 5* review but for Anthony Demetre (chef) coming into the restaurant and reprimanding a waiter for a small misdemeanour -  in front of patrons. “Do that again and you won’t have a job here” is not appropriate to say to any employee  - especially in-front of diners! The waiter looked close to tears and was nothing but perfect when he took care of us.,4,2023,06,22
126,Fantastic hotel in a great location!,First time visiting London and the Sofitel London St James.   The hotel was in an excellent location and was walkable to almost everything we wanted to see and do!  The hotel was beautiful and the staff and service impeccable!  Highly recommend!,5,2023,06,16
126,Would not go anywhere else,"Fabulous rooms amazing service from check in to check out, every member of staff just so helpful and nothing to much trouble. The Sofitel beds are the best I have ever slept in.  The warm welcome on arrival is hard to beat, that just flows through our entire stay. The rooms are very bright and spotlessly clean and fresh, ",5,2023,06,15
126,The best wedding ever!,"
Wonderful wedding!

I held my wedding reception at the Sofitel London St James and stayed at the hotel for 2 nights. I had a magnificent experience!

If you are thinking about hosting an event here, you could do no better. Patricia Castilla, the events co-ordinator, is so impressive. She is charming, extremely able and efficient. She projected so much warmth and sincerity towards us during our day that she really did make it memorable. For example, my mother is disabled and without Patricia, I do not know how we would have gotten me, my huge wedding dress, bouquet, the wheelchair and my mum all safely into the taxi on the morning of the wedding. Patricia got me to the church on time!

Getting married is a once in a lifetime event (one hopes) and you can only dream for it to be special. The day exceeded my expectations and I owe so much of that to Patricia and her wonderful colleagues. 

I considered many potential wedding venues during my Bridezilla planning which was akin to a military operation. I am delighted that we chose the Sofitel. Their banqueting space affords the perfect flow to an event, from the staircase which can be dressed with flowers to give the perfect entrance, to the long reception room which allows guests to saunter around freely, champagne in hand, with plenty of sumptuous seating for those that need it. The banqueting rooms provide a lovely backdrop for dinner and dancing. It was just perfect.

The delicious food was served with precision. I received so many compliments from my guests as to the professional and attentive service from the bar and waiting staff like Liam and Ibrahim who were both a hit with my guests! Perhaps the best compliment I received was that, “this was hands down the best wedding I have ever been to“ I have to agree!

Thank you, Sofitel staff, from the bottom of our hearts! ",5,2023,06,13
126,Wonderful stay in London,"Wonderful experience, super friendly!
Excellent service. Nearby a great park. 
Great breakfast and beautiful and tidy room. 
Everything was there to make it a wonderful time in the hotel. Perfect stay!",5,2023,06,13
126,Best hotel in London,"Perhaps the best luxury hotel in London and I will never stay anywhere else!

Our room was spacious and the bathroom was huge (included separate tub and shower). Bed was large and so comfortable it was hard to get up in the morning! Room service was prompt and the food was hot and delicous.

The hotel restaurant, Wild Honey, is Michelin starred but it never felt pretentious or over the top, and my lord was the food good. We ate breakfast there everyday and never repeated the same meal, the pastries and bread were worth the cost of the meal alone! The St. James bar was homey and the drinks were superb.

Of course you can have great food, comfortable accommodations and and an insanely convenient location, but, if you don't have great staff, you don't have a great hotel. The staff at the Sofitel was wonderful and every interaction was a delight. From the front desk and concierges to the servers to the house keepers, there was no one who was anything less than warm, friendly and solicitous of our needs. I don't think there was any request that was not accommodated with a smile and,""Of course Madam!"" 

I have already booked our next stay and can't wait to go back!",5,2023,06,12
126,The guest is at the centre of the hotel stay.,"The hotel is beautiful, situated in an ideal position to visit central London’s main attractions. Cleanliness and courtesy are hallmarks of the hotel. Breakfast was marvellous, plenty of options and the breakfast staff was extremely attentive even to food allergies. A special thank you goes to Rika who took care of us on our arrival and to Flavia who took care of us in the spa! Thumbs up to all! The atmosphere found in the room before bedtime was very very appreciated!",5,2023,06,09
126,The best thing ever. Fabulous.,Amazing staff Kira and Aaron on my arrival made me feel so warm and welcomed despite the day I had with the rush hour and work stress. The facility was in fact stunning couldn’t get enough of everything. Looking forward to coming back soon.,5,2023,06,08
126,Best place to stay in London,"Best location & best service! They make sure all your needs are met. The rooms are super clean and spacious. Picadillo circus and the station are 3 min away, convent garden is a walking distance as well as St James park. Ideal place to stay in London!",5,2023,06,07
126,Amazing Service,"The service in this hotel was just amazing.  The front desk, concierge, bell hop, wait staff, and room service were all beyond compare.  The hotel is in such a prime location and convenient to everything.  I will make this my hotel of choice when staying in London again.",5,2023,06,07
126,Beautiful hotel in the BEST location for exploring London!,"My daughter and I spent 7 nights at the Sofitel St. James.  From the moment we arrived to our check-out time, the staff did everything they could to make our stay enjoyable.  The bedroom was wonderful - lots of room, tea/coffee service, comfortable beds, nightly turndown, double closets, and a spacious bathroom.  We ate dinner in the lounge area on our first night - burgers and service were great.  The front desk and concierge service were extremely helpful, explaining services available, providing directions and getting us transportation as needed.  Morning breakfast was terrific - a generous buffet with optional menu items cooked to order, in such a pretty space.  All that in the most convenient location to explore London!  It was a 15-20 minute walk to most London sites, shopping, casual and more formal restaurants, Picadilly Circus, Trafalgar Square, Buckingham Palace, Parliament Square and Big Ben, and the Thames River.  So close to everything but a quiet, safe hotel in a very pretty neighborhood.    We had a very enjoyable stay at the Sofitel and would highly recommend to others.  ",5,2023,06,01
126,Cannot justify the cost for what you get,"We have stayed in plenty of Sofitel hotels and usually find them excellent in every way, a premium cost but value for money - eg the Sofitel at T5 Heathrow is consistently one of the best hotels we stay in fairly regularly. Lafayette Square in Washington DC is utterly excellent. We can even justify super expensive places like Fairmont hotels (the incomparable Copley Plaza in Boston) and our several visits a year to Le Manoir Aux Quat Saisons because we feel we get fair value for money.

Sadly I cannot square £604 for 1 night bed and breakfast at this hotel with being value for money on this occasion. Room 635 is rather small and initially very impressive design wise but there are chips and scuffs on a lot of the furniture and quite a bit of dust on and behind the bedside cabinets. There is also a 1inch black mark/scrape on the bath enamel. This may sound like minor gripes but remember they charged me £604 for 1 night so they’ve set a very high bar for themselves and really that means it’s perfection or bust. Not even a packet of biscuits with the tea and coffee tray - at £604 a night, come on, how mean spirited can you get? The bed was comfy and up to usual Sofitel standard however.

All the staff were lovely I must say but service at breakfast was slow given how long it took my wife’s pancakes to come out. Had I paid £38 on the morning I’d have been even more sorely disappointed by the luke-warm full English buffet (although I was pleased to see black pudding, streaky bacon is never welcome) with cold plates - is a plate warmer and a couple of bain marie’s too much to expect?! Also given how slow food was coming out I chose the scrambled eggs rather than request fried which I’d have preferred as there’s no way they’d have come in a reasonable time. 

The location is excellent but that alone cannot justify the crazy room cost  - I’m sorry but the generosity, warmth and sumptuousness you really want and expect at this price point in a supposedly 5 star hotel was missing. A real shame but this hotel over promised, over priced and under delivered for us.",3,2023,05,28
126,Another perfect stay,"We frequent the Sofitel brand, and the London Sofitel is one of the best.  First, the location could not be better.  Close to Trafalgar Square, Buckingham Palace, and the Picadilly tube stop. 

Rooms are comfy and blissfully quiet. Climate control was good, we could keep the room as cool as we wanted. 

The staff is top notch.  Everyone is friendly and helpful.  The concierge was the best, super helpful and made our stay great. Thank you SO much.

Breakfast is excellent, beautiful location, good selection of food, and very nice staff.

Housekeeping was great.

If I had to give one negative, the bar could be better.  It's kind of a cramped area, low ceiling, claustrophobic, and on the weekend it was kind of a tragically hip crowd with loud house music. Not sure what sort of vibe it's going for, but it doesn't really work for me. The staff was good, just the ambiance wasn't to my taste.

All in all, I would never stay anywhere else in London, and kudos to the staff here for always making my stay great! 

",5,2023,05,23
126,Amazing Experience!,"I went on the 12th of May with my husband and had a delightful time. The staff were so gracious and friendly on arrival. The rooms were beautifully designed and in pristine condition. Special shout out to the restaurant and bar staff for being so hospitable, we had an amazing evening. The hotel is in a prime location, very close to everything in central london. We will be coming again and I highly recommend this hotel to anyone thinking of coming.",5,2023,05,22
126,Very nice place,"The hotel is very nice, everything was clean, the food was good (the breakfast and the bar in the evening), the staff were friendly and the location is very central so it`s easy to get to many places in London quickly. ",5,2023,05,18

126,Welcoming and Attentive!,The Sofitel London St. James sets the standard of hospitality at its price point. The room was extremely comfortable and well decorated. The staff could not be more attentive and welcoming. The available amenities far surpass ‘sufficient’ to the point of superlative. I cannot thank the Sofitel enough for providing the ideal home-base for our London vacation. ,5,2023,05,15
126,Outstanding well located hotel.,"This is a beautiful hotel- small and boutique. I have stayed many times. There is just one restaurant and two smaller lounges but it is superbly located. It is equi-distant from Trafalger Square and Piccadilly Square....about 3-5 minutes walk in opposite directions. and with the  additional bonus of an entry to the Mall just a 2 minute walk. 

On this occassion I had a room looking down on the Square in front of the hotel and could already see a stream of pedestrians heading for the coronation when I woke at 5.30am. 

There are usually several staff in the foyer and they are all extremely attentive and polished. Nothing seems to be a problem. And the buffet breakfast is extensive. ",5,2023,05,13
126,Unparallel Service,"I returned to Sofitel London St James for the Kings coronation after staying in the hotel in September for Queen Elizabeth II funeral services. I enjoyed my first visit so much that I knew I would be back. My recent stay was once again unparallel to any hotel experience I've had in my world travels. Everything: The location, rooms and common areas are all presented perfectly. The overwhelming experience is with every single staff member reception associates, concierge associates, housekeeping and room service. Always knowledgeable,  helpful, sincere, warm and respectful.  It doesn't get any better than this.",5,2023,05,11
126,Simply the Best,This is the best hotel at which I have stayed. From the moment I arrived I felt special. A complimentary Earl Grey Tea in the elegant lounge was my first surprise as I awaited check-in time. My beautiful room was ready early. It was beautifully styled and featured views of London landmarks. The bed was so comfortable and the finest linen made sleeping a dream.,5,2023,04,30
126,A perfect oasis,"My wife and I first came here in the mid-2000s and loved it right away, and it has been our go-to hotel in London ever since. We just had another 7-night stay and then a 3-night stay. 

The rooms are always immaculate and the building itself is very quiet-- we often take afternoon naps and it is nice to be able to do that without a lot of noise in the hotel or outside.

The people who work here have been uniformly great. Sally Ann and Aaron went above and beyond to us find the perfect room for our stay (centered around my wife's milestone birthday), but everyone else we dealt with was equally helpful and nice. We often ended our evenings with a drink in the hotel bar, and the crew there was excellent, too.

One of the best things about the hotel is its location: south of Piccadilly Circus and west of Trafalgar Square, putting it right near some of the best parts of London. Yet it is just far enough away (a couple of blocks) that it is like a quiet oasis. We were there over Easter, so the hotel was fully booked, but our room and the hallways were always quiet.

We stayed at the Plaza Athenee in Paris as part of this trip. That is a more expensive hotel and it is certainly very good, but we enjoyed the Sofitel St. James even more.",5,2023,04,27
126,6 Stars for Sofitel Service!,"If there was a way to leave 6 stars we would!

Hotel is the perfect mix of luxury while also being very child-friendly.  

The staff was extremely warm and welcoming to our kids (2 and 5) from the moment we arrived. They were greeted with treats and the most adorable little bears. Our little one had baby bath products and a stuffy in his crib to make him more comfortable.  The hotel even provided London-themed, kid-sized umbrellas for the kids to use during our stay.  The attention to detail and personalization was over the top and incredible!!!

Rooms are clean and modern with great details and amenities. From lovely bath products to stylish decor to built in nightlights (if needed). The room had it all. 

Evening turndown might be one of the best we’ve experienced. Nightly treats and surprises including uniquely personalized ones for the kids. 

Concierge had some great recommendations and overall lobby staff was extremely inviting on every interaction. 

Would definitely stay here again!",5,2023,04,26

Very efficient friendly and attentive staff: from the porter, the restaurant staff and the bar staff to the Concierge team that delivered on all my requests! We were spoiled with daily treats to our room. Wild honey restaurant clearly deserves its Michelin star and is excellent value for money. Very nice cocktails and ambience at the bar.
Service is clearly a big step up from any other Sofitel I’ve been at, and on par with the Rosewoods and Dorchesters I’ve visited but with a fraction of the price! Very well done!",5,2023,04,18

126,Renovated but still great staff and location,"This was our second stay at The Sofitel St James, our first stay was in 2018. Ironically, we were given the exact same suite. The rooms have undergone a complete renovation and are quite modern and unique. We took our youngest daughter with us and she adored the hotel, sites, history, shopping and the entire experience. This kicked off our 4 country, 2.5 week vacation and we were quite pleased again with the location, staff and accommodations!",5,2023,04,04

126,Fantastic hotel,"Truly great experience! Every staff member we interacted with was friendly, courteous and knowledgeable. They seemed to truly care that we were there and wanted us to have an enjoyable stay. The room itself was clean, well laid out and very comfortable. The hotel is very well maintained. Location can’t be beat if you are planning on visiting central London. 10 minute walk to Buckingham Palace. Underground metro station is 5 minutes away. This is our second stay and it won’t be our last! A+++",5,2023,03,30
126,Highlight of the stay: clean bed & great services,"It has the most clean & comfortable hotel bed I had ever slept in. The bedsheet is so crispy clean that it doesn’t have any odors nor pungent detergent smells. The hotel staff made me feel warm and welcoming by adding more details into their daily services (i.e. fresh bottled water, tea, clean cups, cookies, perfectly made bed) but without being overly pestering. I definitely will come back with my family next time we visit London.",5,2023,03,29
126,Another great stay,"We have stayed at this hotel several times whilst visiting London and recently had another excellent stay.  The location is great, staff are very helpful and the cocktails and appetizers in the St. James bar very good. We had a lovely spacious junior suite which had a comfortable bed, high quality linens and good amenities.  Would recommend this hotel and intend staying there again in the future.",5,2023,03,28
126,5* and worth every penny,"Wonderful experience from start to finish. Upon arrival and to the last second we checked out, staff, stay, suite, building, location was amazing.

Wouldn't hesitate to recommend and Sofitel at St James is my first choice hotel for when we next stay in London.

",5,2023,03,26
126,7 Star hotel!,"This is a fantastic hotel in the heart of London. Covent Garden and all the West End theatres, Soho, the National Gallery and the Thames all within easy walking distance. But inside the hotel you would never know. Well appointed rooms keep out the noise and the light even when facing busy London streets. Food is excellent, including the a la carte breakfast. However, as usual it is the staff who make the difference. Without being condescending, or obsequious, they are just friendly and helpful, throughout the whole hotel. The atmosphere in the hotel just simply becomes easy and relaxing. We were unfortunate to have a work crisis whilst staying for a weekend, and had to spend unexpected amount of time working, including in the bar area. The staff could not have been more helpful and hospitable. In the bar Isabel and Tassos are names I recall, but all the staff there were excellent. In reception, I  cannot again unfortunately recall names, staff were immediately responsive to our queries, with occasional texts checking everything was okay (any text query was immediately answered by them). On the door  and in the concierge team, staff offered warm greetings on every entry and exit. Makof, with his great hat, stands out, but this is simply because I remember his name. I hope Sofitel recognises what a winning team they have in this hotel, and supports and rewards them as it should. I would give the hotel 7 stars if I could. We will definitely be back.",5,2023,03,26
126,Sofitel London St James,Excellent location five minutes walk from Picadilly Circus tube station. Crazy expensive room rates. No club lounge at this hotel. Breakfast is a la carte. Would have preferred a buffet. Rooms pleasant enough. No towels in room but housekeeping fixed that.,3,2023,03,21
126,Awesome as usual !,"Excellent location, excellent room, excellent concierge, bar and restaurant, this is a perfect stay for a long week end in London ! We like the rooms and the staff ! It is really easy to walk and go to all places in London ! Prices are expensive as it is on London !",4,2023,03,12
126,Location perfect for West End,"Can’t fault the  Location of the Hotel
Perfect base for two nights at the West End 
Checkin was smooth, however we arrived at 1pm and room not ready until 3pm as per expected 
Was promised a phone call while we went out exploring but it never came 

At checkin we signed up to the £35 breakfast at the hotel 
Very nice, great staff service and tasty food from menu and buffet if still feeling hungry. Excellent coffee 

At 8am breakfast I refused the first table as the server was trying to shoehorn us in between two other couples
So I asked for more privacy and she ushered us to another table without delay 

The first floor studio suite was very clean and had great soundproofing with windows overlooking the street scene 
The mini bar was well stocked but the English tea was very weak and was not replenished 
I didn’t see an ice bucket or machines anywhere 
I think the mineral water was complimentary but the large one was not replenished so not sure if that will appear on the bill later 
Diptyque products in bathroom were another level 

The gym was compact but functional, a bit dated on some of the equipment and lacking basic stretching bands or foam rollers

Hotel was very clean and staff excellent, I liked the text message service with the front desk

In review 
Excellent overall, some minor improvements needed based on price paid. I would definitely consider going back",5,2023,03,07
126,Excellent,"Superb hotel. Very nice location. Staff very helpful. Customer oriented hotel. Restaurant excellent. The bar as well very friendly and cosy. Always enjoyed to come back here. I was never disappointed by the hotel. 
I did many hotel and finally I decided to stay on this one everytime i come in london",5,2023,03,05
126,Highly recommend!,"Our stay at the Sofitel St. James was outstanding!  From check-in to check-out the service and attention to detail was superb.  The location of the hotel is close to all major attractions yet tucked away at the edge of St. James Park so that it was quiet and quaint.  We enjoyed the daily breakfast buffet which had a good assortment to choose from.  If I were to return to London, I would stay at the Sofitel St. James again.  I highly recommend this property!",5,2023,02,23
126,Still the very best hotel in London,"Absolutely love this hotel and was delighted to return for one night to celebrate a special occasion. The wonderful staff provide flawless service and guests are always welcomed like royalty. Particular thanks to Mantas on reception, who was a star. Rooms are stylish and very comfortable; ours seemed newly refurbished. I’m trying not to miss the individual Hermes toiletries as I know the new arrangement must be better for the environment!  Thankfully the bar hasn’t changed much and it still makes great cocktails. Breakfast excellent. This hotel is not cheap but we always feel we’ve had very good value. Highly recommended.",5,2023,02,23
126,Superb Sofitel !!!,"We have just returned from a 2 night break at this hotel and overall we would have to say that the break was faultless !

The staff were all wonderful, attentive and friendly. We especially like the Doorman who went above and beyond to grab us a taxi and help us with our luggage etc. so warm and friendly .. we were sorry that we never caught his name … all we know is that he was lovely and he was french .. 

Our room was spotless and the bed was huge and so very comfortable. Also it was sooo quiet in there.. absolutely no noise at all from the corridor or outside. 

Breakfast at the hotel was beautiful with a wide selection and something for everyone. We had cocktails in the bar which were gorgeous .. although expectedly pricey …but it is London.

We had a beautiful pre-theatre meal in Wild Honey and really enjoyed it. Yummy :) 

The location of the hotel was ideal. A short stroll to the shops and a slightly longer stroll to reach Oxford Street. Good location for theatres etc.

Overall we couldn’t really fault it. Would we stay again ? Absolutely … thank you Sofitel.",5,2023,02,18
126,Well Located,"I came here to celebrate my birthday and the 1st time I saw the hotel I was mesmerised. It was well located and beyond beautiful. At the day of my birthday, I lost my phone and unfortunately, I didnt find it and all the staff was there to help me and cheer me up. They make my day really special though I was really emotional about what happened. Anyway, I’m so thankful for them especially Ms Maria in Guest Relation and Aaron. They really tried their best to help me and all of the staff there. I give them ⭐️⭐️⭐️⭐️⭐️ for the best of everything. The luxury of being here was the best that happened to me. Thanks to all.",5,2023,02,14
126,Disappointing,"How can you get 2 Members of staff so different, spoke to Christiana at the hotel, Amazing so helpful, then a returned call from Zac at the Spa, So unhelpful, un accommodating everything a No, & basically get in touch with Buy A Gift.com re your spa & meal voucher, as by the time we can offer you first available appointment in April your £200 voucher will of expired, nothing we can do ! 😟",1,2023,02,14
126,Miss it already!!,"Location, staff throughout hotel, accommodations and cuisine: all superb. There is a lot of attention to detail at the Sofitel St. James. The staff make your stay memorable while making it look effortless!",5,2023,02,12
126,A perfect week_end in London,"Great experience, 
the decoration of the lobby and the flowers are splendid, the restaurant is certainly not to be missed nor their signature dessert.
The room, a combination of modern and classic styles, was very comfy and very calm. 
The front office, and concierge teams made all possible efforts to make  our stay exceptional and made us feel unique. 
Not far from Piccadilly, very close to Her Majesty's Theater, all atractions not far either by feet or bus or underground. 
We'll be back to try the afternoon tea.",5,2023,02,02
126,My dream came true,"The outstanding services, the small daily gifts, the location, the wonderful atmosphere, the smiling staff faces, and decoration reminded me of the golden hotel ages. I will never even think to look for any other hotel whenever I am in London. 
You made my dreams come true",5,2023,01,19
126,Beautiful Hotel perfectly situated for walking to attractions with 5* Service,"Stayed two nights early January and our stay was perfection. Our room was decorated beautifully with a huge comfortable bed which may have been 6ft. There  was a nice choice of complimentary tea & coffee and  water. Also complimentary biscuits and cake each day.  Very nice touch. Beautiful bathroom. Our room was super quiet (never heard anyone passing in corridor over our two days which I’ve never known in any hotel before ever!)  Breakfast buffet had lots of choice with some nice continental items. All staff gave excellent service. Especially concierge and Valet Parking. Concierge were extremely attentive & remembered my name on our departure morning, another nice touch. Valet parking met us on arrival and took the car promptly. On departure they asked for 30 mins notice to bring car which we did. Car arrived around 15 later. Very impressed. Thank you for an amazing stay at your beautiful hotel. We will definitely return.",5,2023,01,17
126,A Perfect Stay,As always you are make to feel welcome as you walk though the door. The room was lovely with huge bed and a view down onto the Mall. Breakfast was a feast to suit international tastes including full English plus menu items should the buffet not be to you liking. The location 5 minutes off Piccadilly Circus is perfect for weekend trips to the theatre if you wish to indulge yourselves.,5,2023,01,08
126,Holiday,"All perfect!  Great service. All of them are very helpful.  Very fast response.  Thank you to Miss Yee who was very friendly and helpful in the check-in process.  Great room and clean.  The corridors of the rooms smell good all day long, make you happy.",5,2023,01,06
126,Great getaway ,"Great location with lots to do in walking distance.  Only in London for 3 days and we were able to fit in a play, shopping and historic sites. Rooms were clean and the concierge was always helpful with recommendations.  Definitely schedule a trip in December as the area has so many Christmas themed to do(caught the take end of it). ",5,2023,01,06
126,Top choice!,"A brilliant experience from the moment we arrived. The staff are exceptional, the food was fantastic and the room is a decent size and very smart. Couldn’t be happier with our choice.
I’ve stayed in a number of hotels in London but rarely twice in the one hotel. From now on, I will only stay at the Sofitel in St James!",5,2023,01,05
126,Amazing hotel in the heart of London!,"One of the best Sofitels we have ever been to. The entrance of this hotel is already so beautiful and impressive and you are always greeted with a smile by the staff. The location is also absolutely perfect, whether you want to explore the most important spots in London or simply go for some shopping. You are close to everything.

This hotel has also several bars/ restaurants which are all decorated with a lot of taste. Same goes for the rooms which are very comfortable, spacious and beautiful. 

The breakfast area is definitely the highlight, as they have absolutely everything that you would wish for and the room itself is again absolutely stunning.

In general, the staff is very very friendly and trying to fulfil every wish you have. We had an absolute amazing time in this hotel and we can only warmly recommend it to everyone!",5,2023,01,01
126,Perfection,"Perfection all of the way through.  Each interaction with staff was used as an opportunity to improve our experience.  We had an escort to our room who offered to set up afternoon tea in their lounge, which was expectational.  To have a Michelin Starred restaurant service you breakfast in the morning is a rare treat and the bar was wonderful as well.  My kids were eager to return to the hotel each evening to see what treat was waiting with the Turn Down Service.  It was our first visit to London and I can wait to go back.  I would love to give another hotel/area a chance, but there is no way I will ever stay anywhere else.",5,2022,12,23
126,Superb in every way,"We stayed last week for our 54th wedding anniversary. From the moment we walked into the lobby the experience was exceptional.  The staff is incredible,  Rooms are spacious and exceptionally well kept.  Breakfast is delicious and expansive.  Location perfect for theaters and sightseeing.",5,2022,12,23
126,"Sofitel is the best, its people EVEN BETTER.","Agustina, you are the best host I ever seen at any hotel. Your kindness is more than a lot. Thank you so much for your presents and for receiving us like of we were your family more than just guests. Sofitel has taken the best decision by hiring you. Merry Christmas and all the best in 2023!",5,2022,12,20
126,Theatre Night,"We stayed here on Saturday 10th December with 2 of our friends before going to the theatre. On arrival we were met by the doorman who took our cases to the reception. The process was very smooth and this was made even better by being offered a glass of champagne. The staff were very friendly and professional, we were shown to our rooms my a lovely young lady. When she opened the door our breath was taken away, the rooms were absolutely 🤩 beautiful. We were shown all the amenities and were left to settle in. If we were not booked into the theatre my wife and I could have spent all night in the room. A massive thanks to all the staff for making our stay memorable. If you are going to London this hotel is a must.",5,2022,12,11
126,Staff Location Staff make a pleasant stay,"What more can you wish for when arriving and a warm welcome given room assignments as requested etc,etc 
The staff are so accommodating and helpful with everything and they want to achieve your stay pleasant and memorable. We have to say for the location that we both experienced a brilliant nights sleep with No corridor noise or external noise brilliant Brilliant achievement. 
Finishing off with the location you can walk to many different areas in a very short period of time we wouldn’t hesitate to return here anytime. 
Ps thanks for the birthday cake and wonderful stay.

126,Exceptional London Hotel,"I don’t write many reviews, but the Sofitel St. James was exceptional.  Outstanding service at every turn, comfortable and well-appointed rooms, and the location can’t be beat.  By the way, don’t miss the Eggs Benedict, part of their wonderful breakfast.",5,2022,12,08
126,Beautiful Hotel & Great Service,"This hotel is great. Very beautiful in a prime location in London. 

Everyone who works at this hotel great people 
with Greta personality and great attitude except one person (Breakfast Dining Manager) I believe his name is Robertino. This guy needs to learn the rule number one in the hospitality industry you must have good attitude, great smile with a friendly personality. Not just to the guest but also and most important to his coworkers. Three days in this hotel having breakfast and I had the opportunity to see this guys behavior. This guy doesn’t have any skills that can match up the quality, the elegance and service that this great hotel has to offer. 

The room that we stayed was very comfortable and very clean and very quite. I had the opportunity to need the cleaning ladies and this ladies are just amazing. Great smile great attitude alway saying hello. Great feeling of welcoming. 

The polish door man’s and the French concierge great people. This is the kind of people who makes you feel at home. Great attitude with a great smile always going the extra mile to make you feel welcome at home. 

The check in was fast and efficient very friendly receptionist explained everything great smile and very professional. Who later introduces us to Maria. A very lovely lady who gave us a tour of the hotel and eventually escorted us to our room. 

I wish I could remember names but the Brazilian girl, the Macedonian girl and the New Zealand girl who works at the e restaurant for breakfast this ladies are just amazing. This three ladies knows how to put a great sincere smile and great attitude with top notch service. 

The hotel it is absolutely beautiful with beautiful Christmas decor and a beautiful bar with the best location in London just steps away from Piccadilly Circus Tube Station (Metro Subway Station) 

We really enjoyed staying at this hotel and we will definitely when we comeback to London it will be our hotel of choice. 

Thank you for all.",5,2022,11,29
126,Don’t even try for this hotel,This is definitely one of the few expensive but unserviced 5 star hotels. The hotel staff only smile contemptuously at the guest's needs or stop the guest from asking questions with a blank face. The hotel restaurant is also not open during business hours. Everything is chaotic and disorganised. It’s quite easy to understand why Sofitel brand has lost its value in the Accor Group.,1,2022,11,28
126,The perfect stay,"We had an amazing stay at this hotel. It's very central. The room was well-appointed and spotless, the hotel has a lovely bar and restaurant and I loved the decor! We did the afternoon tea and everything was elegant and delicious! We were lucky enough to be staying the night that the hotel was transformed for Christmas so that was a wonderful surprise to wake up to! Beyond all else the staff was exceptional!",5,2022,11,19
126,Sofitel london stay,"Stayed here for 3 days 

Hotel is in a great area and easy access to all the main areas with in a walking distance  

The rooms are clean but small 

As a gold Accor member no upgrade of the room but still enjoyed the green room 

Staff are good and helpful 
Would stay there again",4,2022,11,16
126,A couple of problems to speak of.,"I really like the Sofitel St. James in London. We have stayed there three times and each visit has been very good. But I feel that I must mention the chaotic and bewildering booking system if choosing to contact the Sofitel by telephone. 
You seem to get bounced about from one person to the next with the warning of being put on hold for I think about fifteen minutes. I made a booking for three nights and was very, very clear about the dates. I received a confirmation email shortly after for the wrong dates and the wrong price. I have on my phone five confirmation emails giving four different prices for our required dates. All very confusing.
My biggest frustration was requesting a Premium Luxury Room on the second floor, overlooking Waterloo Place. This was promised on various occasions, even I believe one or two days before our arrival. But on arrival no second floor room for us, only a forth floor with no easy clear view of Waterloo Place. What is the point of paying for a Waterloo Place view room if the only view of Waterloo Place is by clambering on a chair and stretching your neck over the windowsill. If a second floor room cannot be reserved, then it makes no point in trying to reserve one.
In trying to sort out the chaotic booking mess, I wasted a lot of time hanging on the phone. Why do I bother with trying to get a personal service, do I just give up and coldly book online?
I like this hotel, but Sofitel St. James, you are testing this clients patience.",5,2022,11,11
126,I will come back to this hotel anytime.  I was treated like royalty.  It was the best that I ever experienced.  Love the cleanes,"The best experience,  the staff was super friendly. The food was great.  The room were very nice and clean. Everything is near by,  stores and restaurants.  Is very convenient to have proper location. Overall I highly recommend this hotel to anyone. ",5,2022,11,09
126,3 nights stay for special occasion,"The staff was professional and very service minded.
The bar was a nice experience.
The view from our bedroom was terrible - and I had informed them it was for a special occasion. And I am a gold member at Accor.
After showering in the bathroom, over half the floor was flooded with water.
They need some cleaning in there also. and the radio didn't work.",2,2022,11,07
126,AGAIN - HIGHLY RECOMMENDED,"We returned to the hotel and were pleased to see that the high standard of service and hotel facilities was maintained. The real treasure of the hotel, apart from its location, is its excellent staff.",5,2022,11,06
126,Fabulous with a staff which goes the extra Mile,"We just spent a bit over a week at the Sofitel on a business trip and can only recommend this hotel which, to our delight, has managed to keep the highest standards post covid.  The service of the concierge, reception, doormen and at the Wild Honey Restaurant was perfect. Breakfast is delicious, with many healthy options. The Rose Lounge is very suitable for tea or business meetings during the day.  The highlight and Kudos! to the Bar and its staff. Exceptional and friendly service, and the drinks are all of high quality. We stayed in a Premium Deluxe room, which was of good size and quality, had a very nice bathroom and was well maintained by housekeeping. Location of the hotel is within walking distance of Jermyn Street, Piccadilly and beyond. All in all, a wonderful stay and the hotel we will come back to in London. Thank you for making our stay a very pleasant one.",5,2022,11,06
126,stunning,"really good place to enjoy London. the hotel itself is very well located right in the centre of the city. reception staff were amazing, room super cosy, the bar was absolutely stunning (could take a Bit more of lights tho) but cocktail and staff were superb ! ",5,2022,10,24
126,Lovely stay,"Lovely stay

The wife and I had 2 nights here for our anniversary back in April, the hotel was lovely and very luxury.

Location wise it was spot on and a great place to base ourselves over the 3 days we spent in London.

We will definitely be back next year",5,2022,10,22
126,The Perfect London Wedding Venue,"Wow, what an incredible Wedding we had at the Sofitel London St James! Everyone from the Sofitel team went the extra mile in making our day so special. Patricia from the Wedding and Events Team, helped us plan our wedding to perfection, she is passionate, has an eye for detail and service, and really helped us feel at ease throughout the whole process. Olivia from The Rose Lounge brightened our day on many occasions, and her energy and passion is wonderful to see. On arrival, the reception team knew who we were and everyone was so accommodating to our every need, the concierge and guest relations team were also excellent. The hotel is truly 5 star with a relaxing feel. The General Manager Marie Paule is so welcoming and warm, we are so happy we chose the Sofitel as our wedding venue. The wedding venue space is substantial, good links to transportation and the bedrooms are beautiful, super clean and with luxury Diptyque toiletries. But what makes this hotel stand out is the amazing service and dedication of the Sofitel team. Thank you to everyone who made our day special and we can’t wait to return!",5,2022,10,21
126,Just Lovely,"This is the third time we've stayed in this hotel which we really like for several reasons. A great location in the centre of London, the staff are friendly , rooms are modern & comfortable.
Breakfast was fantastic. There's a well stocked buffet of cold meats, cheese, smoked fish, fruit, salad, breads, patisseries & other dishes can be ordered. My favourite dish was the Akuri - spiced scrambled eggs with chapati , delicious!
I look forward to returning.",5,2022,10,17
126,Super hotel in perfect location,"OK, we are regulars at the Sofitel St James which is a haven of calm in the centre of London. We hadn't visited since the pandemic ended and it has now been refurbished and the prices have increased about 75%. The competition is fierce at this new price level, but the Accor All benefits do help to improve the value (room upgrade, welcome drink - champagne, points etc.). The hotel is very hard to fault and we had a really comfortable stay in a luxury room thanks to a double upgrade. Didn't take breakfast as there are so many places in the area to catch a coffee and croisant.",5,2022,10,13
126,Best Hotel Experience Ever!,"Unbelievable hotel experience!  The staff is amazing.  Friendly, welcoming and professional.  We were greeted outside before we had walked through the front door with an offer of assistance with our bags.  Check in swift and flawless.  Staff and the upper management team all greeted us warmly and genuinely wanted us to enjoy our stay. The entire hotel from common area restrooms, lobby, restaurant, bar, etc was spotless and the decor is colorful, comfortable, classy throughout making one feel right at home.  Rooms are the same and offer quality bedding, towels, coffee, water, the list goes on and on with the pampering details.
The location couldn't be better:  Buckingham Palace, Green Park and so many other great destinations just a short walk or Underground ride away.   Don't miss the breakfast!  I am typically not a breakfast person but I could not resist all the healthy offerings.  Fresh pressed juices, chia pudding, broiled tomatoes, smoked salmon.  Delicious!
I look forward to a return to this incredible hotel.",5,2022,10,08
126,weekend trip for marathon,"Great hotel in a great location. Service levels were outstanding, with particular mention to Sally-Ann and Ibrahim! We will definitely book again, as we absolutely loved the hotel and the service. Superb.",5,2022,10,06
126,Sofitel Spa,Absolutely amazing !! From the moment we arrived and received a warm welcome from Deepak and Jane who took care of all our needs during our day. Our daughters had booked a So Romantic Spa for our 30th wedding anniversary which included a express body massage and a rejuvenating facial. We had exclusive use of the steam room and jacuzzi which was a bonus. Also relaxing in the Zen room at the end of our treatment was heavenly. A big thank you also to Natalia and Elisa who carried out our treatments and were extremely professional and very good. The changing rooms were very clean and the whole spa experience was fantastic. Would definitely  recommend and will be retuning.,5,2022,10,05
126,"Best hotel, perfect wedding venue!","Sofitel St James is the perfect wedding venue, with the best Wedding Planning Executive in Patricia. She is attentive, and really cares about the details. She went above and beyond to make sure our wedding day was the most memorable day of our lives and also added so many personal touches on the day that we'll always be grateful for. Her hospitality was absolutely exceptional.

Every member of staff at the hotel are incredibly friendly and you really get the sense that they want to make the day the best it can be for you; from the concierge staff and receptionists, to Olivia in the Rose Lounge and other waiters, and the General Manager, Marie-Paule. we couldn't have asked for better care and service.

The atmosphere in the hotel itself is warm and inviting with a familial feel, especially compared to other 5-star hotels that can sometimes feel a bit impersonal. The rooms and service were great, very clean and the beds were very comfortable. The food at the venue and in the restaraunt was amazing, and we definitely recommend the buffet breakfast! Location-wise, the hotel is very central and easily accessible by public transport - the hotel also has great wheelchair access.

Overall, we couldn't be happier with our stay here! Highly recommend it!",5,2022,09,21
126,Perfect Hotel.,"We have stayed in this hotel many times from 2016, from check in to check out everyone is so professional, and makes the stay perfect, The rooms are amazing and very bright with the most comfortable bed we have slept in. The hotel is very central and walking distance to the underground and St James's park. Already looking forward to our next visit",5,2022,09,17
126,The perfect hotel,"This was our first trip to London. The Sofitel turned out to be the perfect hotel for us.

126,Excellent,"My wife and I stayed for three nights last week . We found all the staff to be warm and friendly. The hotel is lovely and our room was very nice and kept spotlessly clean by the house keeping team . We think the staff make or break a hotel . To a person all the staff were a total credit to the Hotel. We must make a special mention for Steph (Wild Honey ) and I’m afraid I can’t remember his name the head concierge, who went above and beyond to make our stay special. Again thank you all for a lovely stay .",5,2022,09,12
126,My New Favourite Sofitel Hotel,"Sofitel London St James has exceeded all my expectations and unfortunately for the other Sofitel Hotels I stay at, it’s set a new bench mark. 
We check out early tomorrow morning to leave for Positano but I’m happy knowing we are back again in a week for two more nights before we fly home. 
The staff are fantastic. 11/10 for each and everyone of them that we interacted with. They were all friendly, hospitable and delivered excellent service making sure we were happy. 
I have to admit my highlight was breakfast as I’m a bit of a early morning breakfast person. The food selection was excellent and they had great vegan options which was a pleasant surprise and the fruit selection was awesome. Bright coloured fresh fruit such as Kiwifruit, Strawberries, Bananas, Orange, Pineapple and more. 
Our breakfast s each morning was a 2 hour relaxing start to the day. 
We had several visits to the bar and again the staff were fantastic. The bar is very cool with its dark great velvet booths. 
Now for the room. 
As usual the Sofitel beds are very comfortable. I’m not sure what room type we had as we were lucky enough to get an upgrade but it was great. Nice and big and a view out over Regent St. The room was really nicely decorated and being jet lagged it was nice to be able to have a Nespresso machine for 3am coffees. Fast Internet and a good sized bathroom. 
Ordered room service a couple of times and that was good with a very nice room service menu. 
If you’re coming to London this is definitely a place you’d be happy to stay in. Close to the theatre’s, Piccadilly Circus, Regent and Oxford Sts and only a 10 min easy walk to Buckingham Palace. 
We also had the pleasure of meeting the Hotel General Manager and I can see why the Hotel is so well run. 

Looking forward to getting back again  next Friday for our final two nights in London.",5,2022,09,09
126,Welcome Back!,"A go-to for us when we go to London which we hadn't been to since February 2020 when heck was breaking lose in Italy and a pandemic was rising.  We went to London for a short stay on the way home from Champagne and in order to see colleagues. Our go-to had been Corinthia but it was too expensive and Sofitel is better located.  

Check in great. Everyone warm and welcoming. The rooms have all been remodeled; Beds were comfy, room chic, amenities lovely and as always comfortable and inviting.  We love love love their bar and their drink welcome certificate is a long-time favorite of ours. Such a small touch but leaves you with a big smile and a friendly feeling of being welcomed.  Bellman super helpful;  I was able to purchase a lovely hostess gift at the spa for a dinner I was heading to at a friends house.  This is our home away from home and it had been several years since I'd stayed there and it was great.  I'd go back again in a heartbeat. Nothing to ask for improvement. It's perfect!",5,2022,09,02
126,First Class Stay at the Sofitel,"I stayed at the Sofitel for the weekend. The hotel is in a great location for the West End, the Mall and other attractions. The staff are very friendly and helpful. The food and drinks were of a very high quality for breakfast.

Thank you",5,2022,08,30
126,Good Stay in an Excellent Hotel,"Sofitel London 
We have stayed in the Sofitel Saint James hotel for a week. The hotel was first class.
Reception and concierge were excellent. Room was a bit smaller than expected but still good. Especially since we were a company of three (one kid). Room service and housekeeping was faultless. Décor was nice though somewhat old fashioned.
Price was high though it is a five star hotel.
One comment. Price of breakfast and tea room (five o’clock) is extremely high.",5,2022,08,19
126,Short London Trip,"Excellent location, friendly, efficient and helpful staff, making our stay all the more memorable. Nothing appeared to be too much trouble. Rooms are spacious and comfortable. The restaurant, Wild Honey, serves excellent Michelin Starred food, as you may expect of a hotel with a French pedigree.",5,2022,08,12
126,Perfect in every way,"The hotel is perfectly located, the renovated rooms were spacious, clean and comfortable, wonderfull beds, excellent breakfast, there is attention to every little detail to make your stay as pleasant  as possible and I even liked the lovely wooden room keys!

We keep coming back to this hotel, our favourite in london, worth every penny.",5,2022,08,07
126,Absolutely wonderful!,"Stayed at the Sofitel hotel for 3 nights and I wished I could extend my stay!
The staff, the room, the breakfast, everything was amazing!
The hotel is at at. James but close to Piccadilly Circus (tube station, shopping options and plenty of restaurants)
The room (235) was spacious and very lovely. You should definitely book your room with breakfast as it’s the best I ever had in any hotel! You can choose from a buffet or freshly made from a menu according to your requests.
On the check out, I requested to stay a bit longer due to a later flight and they accepted my request without any extra charges. I also mentioned that I love the scent in the hotel corridors and when I checked out, they gave me a candle of the same scent as a present. Super attentive!
Will for sure come back again <3",5,2022,08,07
126,A “brilliant” stay in London,"Wonderful staff and lovely property. Hotel and restaurant staff have gone out of their way to make us happy and our three feisty children.

The rooms were well decorated and had lots of light. The location in St James was great as a base of operations. I was able to run around the park next door. Incredible sites and scenery within walking distance.  
Really pleased.",5,2022,08,06
126,"Comfort, wonderful staff and amazing breakfast.","My wedding anniversary was great when we stayed at Sofitel st James, London. The staff was polite , helpful and always trying to make you feel at home or even better,  make you feel at a  luxurious home ! Me and wife were taken very good care by all the staff in the hotel from doorman to housekeeping. Our room was clean and comfortable everything in good condition, we didn't stayed for dinner but is something in my list to try . the Wild Honey tasting menu. 
We slept like in heaven after we had a nice soapy bath and a nice organic camomile tea left in our bed table while we went for dinner.
The breakfast was a complete breakfast with everything you could ask for and for the occasion we were offered a glass of champagne , a happy wish for our anniversary and a little souvenir.I'm very happy with the service and for the overall and we would spend again our anniversary in Sofitel.
Thanks to everyone that made our day to be great.",5,2022,08,03
126,REALLY GOOD HOTEL,"I'm a reasonably regular guest at Sofitel St James, and always enjoy my stays.  It's really well run, very comfortable and welcoming.  The location is second to none.
My only complaint this time related to the check-in which wasn't as professional as usual.  My Diamond Accor status wasn't acknowledged, no upgrade and no drinks voucher.  Also the hotel bar was shut on one of my three evenings, they offered drinks outside which doesn't appeal to me.
Even so this is a great hotel and I'll return.",4,2022,08,01
126,Excellent Accommodation,"The whole experience was wonderful, especially the staff were super welcoming..
The doorman and concierge are so friendly.

126,My FAVOURITE London Hotel,"I LOVE this hotel.  Alas, I haven't visited very much over the past 2 years due to the pandemic.  I had the privilege to stay for just one night recently and what an absolute TREAT!  Lovely spotless room, with the most comfortable bed.  The staff are second to none, always greeting you with a smile and addressing you by your name (how they do that, with so many guests is beyond me!).

126,"Wow, our new home in London","For years we have always stayed at the Rosewood in Holborn, but when we checked the rates again, well, wow – over £1500 a night for a standard room.  I know prices have gone up everywhere, but that is too high.

So, we had a look around, and I have status at Sofitel hotels – usually staying at Heathrow T5 when flying, so I checked to see if there was a Sofitel in central London, and yes there was!  

The location looked good, easy walk up to all the central locations.  A regular room was around £700 per night, so it was booked for 2 nights.  We arrived on a Thursday.  Our taxi was met by a friendly doorman, who took our name and took us along to the reception desk.

First impressions were very good – staff was engaging and felt genuinely friendly, quick hotel tour and then up to our room, which was on the 5th floor.  The room (all of them I think) was recently refurbished, and although the view was out the back of the hotel (not that we expected a view!) the room was very well appointed.

Over the course of the 2 days, I can honestly say that we were made to feel so welcome.  The hotel is lovely, a wide and open lobby, with attentive staff.  The Spa is very good.

We were here for a bit of business at the US Embassy, and leisure. We had such a nice stay we even extended it to include the Saturday night.

The bar is a nice place to spend time, the cocktails are heavenly, and we were looked after by Veronica, who made time to speak to us and made sure we were looked after.

So, thank you Sofitel St James – our new home in London from now on.",5,2022,06,20
126,"Stylish, understated hotel with first class service, food and location.","We just had our second stay at the Sofitel St. James in London.  Outstanding service and the location is amazing. It is in the heart of everything, but perfectly clean and quiet. The hotel is stylish and the food excellent. I have been in the Sofitel loyalty program for years. It is a really well run business with excellent employees.  We had a prestige suite which was lovely.",5,2022,06,07
126,Location location location,"Our stay started with a very polite and helpful doorman who took our extensive luggage from our car and arranged for parking. The front desk arranged for us to have our afternoon tea 1hour earlier than booked the Jubilee afternoon tea was excellent staff could not be faulted and the food was plentiful and fantastic. Our room a junior suite was very comfortable. We were there for 3 nights so relaxing felt as though we had been there longer, while there we went to the Chelsea flower show got there early and left after 5 hours mostly due to the rain but this turned out to be very lucky as when we got back to the hotel we managed to have a wonderful lunch in the Wild Honey restaurant, breakfast was also excellent. All the staff we met could not be faulted All in all a great stay Thank you   ",5,2022,06,03

126,This is one of the finest hotels in the world,"We have visited the Sofitel, St James in London several times. It is ideally located around the corner from Trafalgar square, close to St. James Park and Buckingham Palace, two blocks from the entertainment at Picadilly Circus, and just down the street from our favorite restaurant, San Carlo. The hotel staff are immaculately dressed, helpful, knowledgeable and friendly The Concierge is extremely helpful with any requests. The rooms are furnished with taste and quality, and the linens are excellent quality. We highly recommend the Sofitel and we will return. It is pricey, but well worth the extra cost.",5,2022,05,08
126,Unfortunately the beds leave a lot to be desired but the staff are excellent,"Extremely pleasant staff who tried very hard to assist 
They were always friendly and helpful. Unfortunately the bed in the room was not flat it dipped in the middle 
& I had a very bad sleep the first night. My back was extremely sore all of the following two days. I did let the staff know of the issue and they tried to rectify it. Unfortunately it was really no I better and we were leaving after the second night. If you have any back issues I suggest you ask for a flat bed 
Other than that the hotel was fine",4,2022,05,08
126,Happy 20th Anniversary,"The hotel celebrated its 20th on April 30th with free champagne in the lobby for the guests.

Rooms are brightly colored and very modern.

126,The best hotel in london with the greatest staff,"Love love love this hotel. I used to work at this hotel and enjoyed every minute of it so when we went to london for dinner I took the opportunity to have some drinks in the St James bar. The bar has changed since I was there and the new changes are top class. The staff were amazing, so polite and attentive with one of the bar staff talking us through some vodkas before we settled on his choice for us which was superb.

Could not fault this experience and will be back next time we are in london.

Beautiful hotel that I have to say is my favourite hotel in the capital 👏👏",5,2022,04,07
126,Wonderful experience,"From the moment you walk into the hotel you are treated exceptionally. From the door men - who took our bags - to the reception staff - so polite and accommodating. Nothing was too much trouble. 
The room was beautifully decorated - with a bathroom to die for . Comfy beds, immaculately clean, lovely calming smell around the whole hotel.  A nice added touch was the complimentary chocolate dessert plate in acknowledgment of a birthday. 
Breakfast in the wild honey restaurant was delicious, again the staff couldn’t have been more accommodating. 
A wonderful experience.",5,2022,04,04

The rooms are nice and super clean.",5,2022,03,15
126,Calm and elegance in heart of city,"Such a lovely hotel, fantastic helpful staff, in an amazing location.
Had a great 1 night stay on my own at the end of Feb, celebrating me myself and I with some luxury after months of very very hard work and no play! Enjoying the bath, streaming my own tv shows from my laptop on the TV, and the amazing bed.
FoH checked in through text messages on my phone to see if I needed anything which was a lovely way for me.

I also enjoyed an 8 course tasting menu in Wild Honey restaurant (which had just gotten 1 Michelin star), every course was so tasty and on point, I really enjoyed everything, paired with a good wine. Nobody made me feel weird about dining alone as well (which always feels as a bit of a barrier).

Solo diners: do not listen to those barriers, trust me, just a bit of a hop over it and then realise that one person has just as much right to excellent dishes as couples and groups do. I just read a review from another solo traveller in the hotel who would have loved a dinner in the restaurant but felt awkward about dining solo and didn't do it. Such a loss, just go ahead and do it.

Also I really loved the wallpaper and decor in the restrooms downstairs has to be said.

Lastly, the breakfast in Wild Honey restaurant was so great as well, I had yummy eggs benedict in addition to the extensive buffet choices, and the coffee is just so so good!

Would love to return for some pampering after saving up a bit again :)",5,2022,03,09
126,Excellent short stay,"We stayed for one night to visit the theatre. This hotel is in an excellent location for shopping or easy access to theatres or restaurants.

126,A class above and  one of the best well run hotels in London,"The Sofitel St James is where quality service is standard. The hotel is run by a fantastic team and manager who work hard to provide an unrivalled level of service..with ease and without trying. The owners should be very proud of their team. Most guests do not appreciate the immense hard work that goes on behind the scenes by the team at the bar/ resturants/conceriege /housekeepers and reception.This is often over looked which is due to a lack of appreciation and a  complete lack of understanding.
Those who want flawless quality without compromise already know ..this for those who don't know.

126,What an Amazing Hotel !!!,"At the beginning of March 2022 I was lucky enough to be invited to a reception at St James' Palace in connection with a charity I'm involved in, and the Sofitel London St James was the obvious choice. Just 5 minutes down the road, and glowing reviews from lots of other guests.  I should explain that this was a very emotional and stressful stay for me. It was my first trip to London in 2 years (since the start of the Covid pandemic) and, more importantly, my first time staying in a hotel on my own in 20 years. My husband died 2 years ago and  during 20 years together we had travelled the world, staying in some of the best hotels. Now, on my own, this seemed like a real challenge. However I need not have worried. The welcome I received at the hotel was warm, friendly and immediately put me at ease. I have to make a special mention of front of house star Florian who welcomed me and showed me to my room. We was so kind, friendly and welcoming I felt totally at home.  If anyone from Sofitel management read this - please look after Florian. He is an incredible asset to your hotel and an amazing ambassador for the Sofitel brand. Every aspect of my stay exceeded expectations - it would have been lovely to enjoy dinner at Wild Honey, but the prospect of dining alone was just too much - maybe next time. In summary I would give the Sofitel London St James my highest recommendation, and hope that it won't be too long before I return. And thank you Florian for making my stay just perfect.",5,2022,03,05
126,A  3 night break in the heart of London,"This beautiful hotel is situated a few steps away from the Royal Mall in one direction and short stroll from Piccadilly Circus in the other.
The building is exquisite, the rooms are absolute luxury (particularly the beds which are to die for!) and the breakfast is the finest in London. But what sets this hotel apart is the staff here who are all the perfect mix of professional and friendly. The staff recruitment and training is second to none and we are so very grateful for the wonderful service provided.
The Sofitel is not the cheapest hotel in London and nor should it be because it is one of the very best.
My advice is go there and treat yourself to one of the best hotel experiences money can buy.",5,2022,02,22
126,Truly exceptional!,We had the most fantastic experience at the Sofitel St James. There wasn’t one aspect of our stay that was anything less than exceptional. The facilities and rooms were luxurious but the greatest attribute of this hotel is the service and attentiveness of its staff. I especially wish to mention Sally-Ann and Jeff who greatly assisted us whilst we were there.,5,2022,02,21
126,Cocktail bar is great,We ate at Wild Honey which is connected and then went in to the cocktail bar of the Sofitel. It was excellent and a lovely way to end the evening.  Very good choice of cocktails and attentive friendly service.  The staff were very cheerful.  Spoke with the receptionist at the hotel and she too was very customer friendly and engaging.,4,2022,02,19
126,weekend stay in London,"We have stayed here several times before and are members of Accor. The staff in any hotel make all the difference to any stay and the Sofitel brand always go out of their way to ensure you have a fabulous stay in their hotels wherever in the world and this one in St James is no exception , from the doorway entrance to leaving on Sunday we had a fantastic time looked after by all the staff there.

Beautiful designed rooms and perfect breakfast. I can really recommend this hotel.
We also had diner in the restaurant of the hotel Wild Honey which was amazing too..",5,2022,02,14
126,Great location and such a warm welcome,"A Sofitel hotel that knows how to make a stay special. Check in desk welcome you to the hotel, make sure you know all you need to about your stay, escorted to the room by the guest manager, Remy, who knew my name without being told and introduced me to the room. This might sound over the top, but it certainly makes you feel welcome. There was a welcome card in the room too and a quick call to make sure everything was ok, which the also asked on check in if it was OK to contact you during your stay. 
The bar staff provide a delightful atmosphere, drinks on or off the menu, if they have the ingredients they’ll make you drink and make sure it’s to your liking too. Can recommend the Bloody Mary. 
Breakfast in the Wild Honey restaurant was an extensive cold buffet and a full cooked choice too. 
Can recommend the Eggs Benedict. 

A perfect experience and location, if you looking for a hotel in London, that you can just relax in, this is it. ",5,2022,02,11

Undoubtably this is an expensive hotel but the service and quality make it all worthwhile. A fantastic birthday treat.",5,2022,01,25
126,Long-awaited return to the Sofitel,"The Sofitel has long been our favourite London hotel, but between their refurbishment and the pandemic we hadn’t been for well over 2 years. We were a bit anxious about returning, having avoided London in Covid, but the Sofitel has exemplary standards of cleanliness and mask wearing, so we immediately felt confident. Thankfully the refurbishment hadn’t resulted in major changes, other than to the restaurant area. Service still brilliant, rooms were as comfortable and quiet as ever. The bar is still first class, wonderful service and the best cocktails, and was always buzzing with life even though the rest of the hotel was relatively quiet. The restaurant has been completely remodelled, layout is more spacious and practical but it’s lost some charm along the way. The previously magnificent breakfast buffet is a shadow of its former self, breakfast was perfectly fine but vastly reduced choice and some reduction in quality too. Hard economics and Covid hygiene protocols, so completely understandable, but a little disappointing nevertheless. I particularly missed proper teapots, tea goes cold fast in a glass cafetière and the strainers leak tea leaves into the cup, and decent honey (ironically the restaurant is now called Wild Honey). I’m being picky but the Sofitel isn’t cheap and these would be simple things to fix. Having said that we really enjoyed our stay, it’s the staff who make this Sofitel special and they were all amazing.",4,2022,01,24
126,Royalty,"Although we’re not royalty, we we treated by absolutely everyone as if we were!
All the Sofitel team were amazing and the hotel itself, stunning!
Make sure your stay includes the breakfast, delicious.",5,2022,01,19
126,Superb from start to finish,"Back here after 11 years - it was excellent before and it's even better now.  
Check in was efficient and so friendly - so impressed that they mentioned my stay 11 years ago.  I was lucky enough because of my Accor status to get an upgrade to a wonderful family suite.  Reception staff followed up with a text to see if everything was okay, and all greeted me when I came and went from the hotel, and on check out they made sure I was happy with everything.

The family suite was amazing.  Lovely sitting room with large sofa (sofa bed), desk, fridge, chair and footstool and huge TV.  Really nice touch to get some delicious dark chocolate squares.  Separate lavatory and wash basis and if you do have kids there's a door you can close to separate them off!

Separate dressing area is always a bonus.

Large bedroom with the most comfortable bed and pillows ever.  Small lavatory and a separate large bathroom.  Hermes toiletries were lovely and lots of them.  
One personal point - I found the heated loo seat and loo dryers rather disconcerting......    

All scrupulously clean.

Bar service was excellent - yes, it's expensive but it's a five star hotel in central London.

Mention for the two concierges - so friendly and helpful.

Location is great - it's quiet and yet central.  Two minutes walk from major theatres and 5 minutes from Picadilly and Regent Street.

This is a great hotel, a lovely building and in a great location.  But what makes it great is the amazing staff.  They really are the best.  I cannot recommend this hotel more highly.",5,2022,01,18
126,Wonderful Service,"We had a great stay at the Sofitel London St James over the NY holiday period. Service was wonderful and nothing was too much to ask - a personal welcome and check in experience by Marion was first class while the concierge team kept us taken care of whether it was parking our rental car overnight, recommending and booking restaurants or just wishing us a good day anytime we would leave the hotel (thanks to Jeff, Gianmaria and the rest of the team)

The upgraded room (due to our Accor status) had a great view over Waterloo Place and was clean and spacious. When technical support was required things were taken care of without fuss (malfunctioning room phone, coffee machine fix). The shower pressure was great unlike some other hotels we had recently experienced and the bathroom was a good size with both shower and seperate bath. The location was best suited to us with Trafalgar Square, Covent Garden and Piccadilly/Regent Street all a short walk away. The only comment I have is a night light for the bathroom was sorely missing - any bathroom visit in the middle of the night involves turning on the incredibly bright bathroom lights and waking up the rest of the room while being blinded!

Overall a wonderful experience at the Sofitel London St James and would have no hesitation in recommending.",5,2022,01,14
126,Amazing Hotel and Staff!,"The hotel staff members are extremely nice. Veronica, Sara, Rémy, Jeraldine and many more are simple amazing. I loved my stay at this hotel. The gym is really really nice. The hotel was always clean. Housekeeping service was more than amazing. Breakfast at this hotel is crazy delicious, specially the veggie omelette, black pudding, sausage and the amazing croissants 🥐 
This hotel is a straight 10/10
I will DEFINITELY stay at this hotel again whenever I’m in london.",5,2022,01,03
126,Business trip,"Sofitel will never disappoint their visitors. Regardless of the reason of your trip the ambiance of the hotel, the positive vibe and the very professional and friendly services by all their staff will convince you to come back again. Personally, it is my favorite hotel in London. It gives you the luxury French experience and the home feeling. Food is great 👍 don’t miss the beef burger and the fresh delicious breakfast.",5,2022,01,01
126,Pre Christmas breal,"This hotel is perfectly situated right in the heart of Mayfair. If you are looking for a shopping experience and being right near your favourite department stores and close to the major attractions this hotels location will save you so much time and costly transportation.

When you arrive at this hotel immediately it offers a bespoke and intimate experience and parking and arrival is just perfect.

When you go inside reception the Christmas decorations I think are the most magical I have seen for many many years.

Check-in was truly incredible and I will luggage was at our room in seconds

We got a full tour of the hotel and all its amenities I must recommend the spa!

Afternoon tea looked amazing and the restaurant bar area was very much a signature part of the hotel.

The rooms are very spacious and incredibly well decorated had a very high-end standard.

We sometimes think of London is five star hotels that are very commercial this is truly the jewel in London is Crown let’s hope it remains a secret well done to all the staff are so friendly",5,2021,12,11
126,A great hotel and amazing stay!,"I returned to the hotel again and it only gets better! Marion and her staff, door personnel to check in were exceptionally helpful and courteous, nothing was a trouble and always there to provide for very detail. It’s a very well presented hotel and rooms very well equipped. Looking forward to returning again! This hotel is well worth staying at!",5,2021,12,08
126,Nice to be back.,"It's been a little while, but I was very pleased to make a return visit back to the Sofitel St James. So well positioned in Waterloo Place, with the added attraction of a large Christmas tree plonked down in the middle. But also yet another even brighter Christmas tree was to be found in the spacious lobby of the hotel. This made our stay a little special being surrounded daily by glitter, toys and even a little train set. What I found amusing were the hoards of people outside, gathering to take pictures of the large tree outside. Our bedroom window gave us a grand view of it all. All staff we encountered were keen and helpful. I mention Leander in the restaurant (Hope that spelling is correct) in ensuring we had a table that was good for my back. The bench seats, even with a cushion are a problem after an hour or so. And Italian Marina, who was very nice and gave little cakes as it was my wife's birthday. I like to chat to the security men as standing hour after hour must be a tiring task. What a great hotel. We will surely return next year.",5,2021,12,07
126,Poor service…,"We have been there end of November, and the service was not as expected. As an Accor platinum member, this is the only hotel where I was never upgraded, considering that the hotel was not full is unacceptable. At the checkout I explained them for half  an hour the difference between debit and credit card, and when a manager (Marion) finally arrived it seemed they understood… but no.. they did not… and have charged my stay twice, and now I am loosing time with the bank and the hotel to solve this. A bad experience, a good location but poor staff… go for other London hotels.. there are plenty at this price range .. more that 600£/night.",4,2021,12,05
126,Sofitel St James,"Our first visit to this Sofitel. Our usual London Hotel is Renovating.
From the moment we arrived.. the Bellman, Reception, all welcomed . Our 2nd Day Test was waiting for us with Reception( made the process  seamless)..the Lovely Room.
Hotel was lovely.. great Doors.. made the Room perfect ..no noise from other Doors.
Great Holiday Decirations and a Great Bar for a Drink at the end of a long day.",5,2021,12,04
126,Definitely a must in the heart of London,"From the first entrance at check-in through the warm welcome at the restaurant, everything is done to make your stay an unforgivable experience. The rooms are spacious, stylish, beautfifully decorated with every tiny detail taken care with the utmost attention. Not to mention the unique location and the beautiful area. Without any doubt a must place for anyone who is seeking for upscale but warm place to spend a wonderful trip to London.",5,2021,12,03
126,Utterly Sublime,"We stayed here two years ago when it was my birthday & it was so good we returned for another birthday celebration. There was a delicious slice of chocolate cake in our room on arrival & cake at dinner.
Our room was superb at the front overlooking the square & the Xmas tree. A comfortable stylish room.
Breakfast was excellent. A lovely buffet of patisseries, breads, cold meats, cheeses, fruit, smoked fish & you could order cooked breakfasts of traditional English, eggs, etc & there were vegan & vegetarian options.
We stayed for three nights & ate in the restaurant on 2 of the nights. Dishes were very tasty . On the first night I had grilled octopus followed by a very tender venison. The next night in the restaurant I had a starter of crisp chicken with macaroni & succulent lamb for my main dish.
What I love is the delicious canelés they serve with the coffee- they are yummy .
Staff are friendly & attentive particularly Leander & Marina in the restaurant.
I look forward to making a return visit.",5,2021,11,29
126,Fantastic location,"Gorgeous hotel, the Christmas tree and decorations were up so the hotel looked beautiful inside and out. Stayed in a room with 3 single beds, fantastic linen on beds, lovely bathroom with toiletries and robes. The towels were big and fluffy. We didn’t eat in the hotel so cannot comment, we had a late night drink in the bar ( I thought slightly overpriced). Friendly staff throughout the hotel,  from the lovely man outside to the reception staff and bar staff. Would stay again if I was going to Her Majesty’s Theatre which is two minutes walk away.",5,2021,11,28
126,"Amazing service, room, staff and location!","Amazing stay.  The staff (Remy and Sara) were very welcoming, and aware of it being my sister's birthday and went the extra mile to provide treats of champagne and a patisserie in our room upon arrival. There was a lot of choice at breakfast, including vegan and vegetarian options. We are vegetarian and they were really accommodating at breakfast. Lovely bread and patisserie. The location is ideal for the West End areas, and in a lovely quieter area towards pall mall. Regent st is around the corner, central shopping area, Covent Garden, Leicester Square etc., are all walkable from here. 
 The rooms are very comfortable. We had a luxury triple room, and the third roll away bed was very comfortable. Lovely large bath. A great stay!",5,2021,11,26
126,“Nowhere else but London” and Sofitel,"What a fantastic hotel in the heart of the action. Located in St James, close to Piccadilly, Soho and other great activities the hotel itself is a refuge from all the action. The staff are fantastic and the amenities up to date. I loved staying here and will definitely be back.",5,2021,11,25
126,Wonderful,"This is our third stay at this hotel and I cannot fault it.  Perfect location for us. The staff are friendly yet professional, breakfast is excellent and the Christmas decorations are just amazing. Special thanks to Amelie for helping to make us feel so welcome.",5,2021,11,21
126,Sadly disappointed,"Following our wedding last week we decided on a short “mini-moon” to our favourite hotel The Soffitel London St James.  As returning customers for many years, sadly Soffitel you did not meet our expectations this time and we will not be returning 
On arrival we were greeted with a warm and friendly welcoming as is always the case.  We were given our room, however on arrival it appeared to be an “easily accessible” room which had been renovated to facilitate a “wet room”.  Perfect if you are in a wheelchair but with a tiny low down sink and low down toilet was not what we asked for and there was no bath which is always essential when we stay away from home. My husband requested a bath at the time of booking but this was not accommodated. The view from the window looked like air conditioning pipe work on show. Very ugly.  (However, whilst not pleasant to look at not a massive issue as we did not plan on spending our time looking out the window) we decided to stay as couldn’t be bothered with the hassle of moving. However that quickly changed.  
Here is the issue in room 208.  The shower was atrocious,  spraying all over the top of the shower curtain and soaking the floor which had no drainage and anything else on site.  We had to use every towel we had to mop Up the aftermath.   Following a shower I spent an hour 2” deep in water around my feet putting my make up on. It was uncomfortable, slippery and dangerous.  Not what I expect from a £600 a night hotel room.   When we complained, we were moved without problems, however it was inconvenient and not what I expect to do on a weekend away.   The new room was lovely. Thank you for accommodating us without any problems.   
I am mostly surprised that the soffitel did not offer us some form of reimbursement at most or even so much as a complimentary drink for how we were inconvenienced.  We had nothing.  My husband and I don’t expect any kind of freebie but it would have been gratitude to offer us a drink.   I don’t expect to move rooms on a weekend away especially in a hotel with such high standards as The Soffitel.  It was off putting to say the least and unfortunately has tarnished the name we valued so highly.   I am disappointed to say the least.   On a positive note, the rooms are decorated to a very high standard and the staff pleasant and polite.",3,2021,11,21
126,I treasure this hotel,"I genuinely don't know how to do this hotel justice! I first discovered it last summer when the world was largely shut down, and all the hotels I've stayed in in London before we either full or closed. Thank goodness! As a result I found this hotel and from the very first moment they couldn't have been more welcoming, more on the ball, or more thoughtful. That trip we ended up extending .. a few times. The rooms are beautifully finished, recently updated; the beds are super comfortable. The signature scent of the hotel is literally my favourite so I find myself taking a deep breath when walking down the halls. The gym is well laid out and has everything I needed. 
Since that first time I have now stayed a few more times and have a few more stays already booked in - the staff always remember me, they greet me by name, they always smile, offer an umbrella, interact with my kids. They send a text when you arrive to check that everything is as you want it to be. The concierge team are very capable and prompt and give great suggestions. The reservations team are also incredibly helpful online. They have an arrangement with a covid testing provider which makes this more seamless than many other places. And then there is the location which is PERFECT! I have difficulty walking (at the moment) and so the fact that everything is so close and accessible from the hotel is a huge bonus. 
In short, I love the hotel, the physical building, but it's the staff who really make this hotel stand out for me. They are an absolute credit to their organization. Thank you to all of them for always making me feel like you actually care if we enjoy our stay.",5,2021,11,17
126,A good place to stay,"Good location, great room, friendly service, excellent cooking in combination with good pace of service made lunch in the restaurant a real pleasure. All in all a very positive experience. I shall most certainly stay at this hotel again in the not too distant future.",5,2021,11,10
126,London's Perfect Five Star Hotel.,"Perfectly located for London's smartest stores, restaurants, and the very best pubs, this hotel is also notable for being in the midst of theatre land.

The staff here are excellent, from the welcome by the concierge when you first enter, to the receptionist in who checks you in with smooth efficiency and a friendly greeting and smile, all of which sets the tone for your entire stay.

The guest rooms, are simply superb.

I love the bar each evening and also the breakfast room, which provides me with an elegant begining to each and every day I spend in London.

In my view, there really is no finer place to stay.",5,2021,11,09
126,Great stay - Sofitel St James feels like home,"Sofitel London St James is just great: The breakfast & dinner in the restaurant, the room, the services from the concierge/reception/housekeeping - and the building.
It is really worth a stay; feels  like home.
I have been there twice and I will return!",5,2021,11,08
126,Amazing Family Stay,"Service was fantastic all through! Location, amenities and breakfast were great. A huge shout out to the concierge running the afternoon/night shift, they made our stay extra special with their attention. I would definitely return to this property.  ",5,2021,11,02
126,Great building in a great location,"Exceptional quality of exterior and interior. Clean, tidy and well laid out rooms. The breakfast and the service were also of the highest quality. I would have no hesitation staying t this hotel again.",5,2021,10,30
126,Pure Luxury,The Sofitel brand is known world wide for its amazing customer service and the Sofitel St James is no exception. From the minute I walked in the door I felt genuinely welcomed and valued as a guest. My check in with Manfred was friendly and efficient and in no time I was enjoying the comforts and amenities of my luxury king room. During my stay I also got to experience the St James bar and the Wild honey restaurant. The cocktail menu is very different to your normal hotel menu with lots of unique and delicious drinks to choose from. The location of the hotel is second to none only minutes walk to lots of London attractions and sights. If you want to immerse yourself in the middle of it all then this is definitely the hotel for you. I’m already planning a return trip.,5,2021,10,20
126,All very good,"Room v nice Bathroom also. Comfortable bed. No traffic noise
Staff friendly, and courteous.
Breakfast excellent, 
BUT.....I'm still waiting for a receipt via e mail, so my expense claim is seriously delayed",5,2021,10,18
126,Second home,"From the second you walk through the door you are made to feel right at home, every member of staff in the hotel go above and beyond, every member of staff knew my name, I would recommend this hotel to everyone, it’s perfectly placed to explore London, and the rooms are finished to a very high standard, we can’t wait to go back for our next stay",5,2021,10,18
126,Amazing Hotel! Amazing Wedding! Amazing Planners!,"My wife and I decided to get married in the midst of the Covid-19 pandemic, hoping by the summer things would get better and mass gatherings would be allowed. This idea would not come to fruition without Sephora and the team at Sofitel London St James Hotel. 

Sephora and her team managed our event with a unique calmness, assertiveness, and confidence. During the planning stages, they were extremely supportive of our wishes and always came up with ideas to make our wedding to our taste, despite the fluctuating restrictions to UK weddings. The Sofitel Chef who catered for our intimate dinner reception was amazing too. The food and wine were exquisite and our guests thoroughly enjoyed themselves. 

The hotel itself is beautiful. The rooms (ours was purple to my wife's liking) possess a beautiful decor full of character and the customer service was amazing throughout our stay.  

All in all, we cannot thank Sephora and the team enough for such a wonderful day. I highly recommend engaged couples to view Sofitel London St James Hotel and enquire about their wedding. I can promise you will not be disappointed.",5,2021,10,12
126,The French do it BEST!,"What can I say...
Love the Sofitel London St. James! 
Number 1...The Decor is Amazing! 
Who doesn't want Debbie Harry staring at them while they sleep! 
Number 2...The beds! Does a soft billowy cloud interest you? 
Number 3...The Location! You really can't beat it! You can walk to a ton of London top attractions!
Just stay there! 
Did I mention Hermes Ammenities :)
We were in London for a month and stayed at the Sofitel for 8 of those 30 days. 
The rest of the month was spent in various 5 Star Hotels and while the service was also great in the other hotels, the beds were hard and uncomfortable. With each stay, we regretted not going back to the Sofitel. 
There is always a next time...So Sofitel London...We promise to see you again:)",5,2021,10,05
126,Great Hotel but Bar Shut!,"I've stayed at Sofitel St James half a dozen times, and it's among my favourite hotels in London.   I was looking forward to this particular stay as a post-pandemic treat.

Things were mostly excellent as always, helpful staff, an upgrade because of my Diamond membership, and a generous late checkout.

However, my stay was on a Tuesday and Wednesday nights, and I was disappointed to be told that the hotel bar was shut for those two evenings, Tuesday and Wednesday.   It had been open the previous evening, and I was assured that it would reopen the day after I checked out (not much good to me!)

I've always enjoyed a pre-dinner cocktail at the bar, and sometimes sit there for an hour to read my book, and I expected that facility on this occasion.

The staff were apologetic, and served me a drink in the restaurant area, not nearly as nice, beside swing doors to kitchen with a not so nice view of a rubbish container.   Sofitel should do better at this price point.

Let's hope things will be better when I next stay.

Apart from this issue, I really like the hotel.  It still gets four stars.",4,2021,10,03
126,Delightful Stay,"We really enjoyed the Sofitel St James. From arrival to departure, all was excellent.  Attentive staff who were so helpful, very good cuisine, very clean surroundings, and a great location. Thank you very much to everyone for making our stay so enjoyable.",5,2021,09,29
126,Excellent birthday weekend!,"Hotel is located right by Piccadilly Circus, so location is perfect as a 1 min walk away from the London buzz but located in a quiet part.

Would definitely stay here again and next time I’d try the spa facility.",5,2021,09,27
126,Superb over-night stay to attend celebratory event,My wife and I arrived to an exceptionally curtious reception and were shown to a lovely room with every comfort.

126,An excellent experience at the hotel,"We had an excellent  mini sejour at the Sofitel St James.  The location is very central and convenient for shopping and visiting attractions on foot.  Our welcome on arrival was exceptional (Marion, guest relations manager, was particularly attentive and welcoming).  Our room had been very tastefully refurbished, and was spacious, clean and extremely comfortable.  We could not fault the other facilities that we used (restaurant, fitness suite and pavement/terrace cafe (a very good addition to the hotel's facilities).   ",5,2021,09,23
126,Still great staff and wonderful hotel,"This hotel has a great location and the building is beautiful.  Rooms are comfortable and everything works.  However, the reason we keep coming back is due to the staff.  They have always been helpful before, during and after our stay.  If there are any problems these are quickly resolved.  All staff wear masks which we found reassuring.  The arrangements for Day Two testing worked well and the staff were very familiar and helpful with the process.  

Staff in the cosy bar are welcoming, the range of products available for breakfast is fantastic.  We’ve already booked our next trip.",5,2021,09,19

All the staff are friendly, helpful and do a lot to make sure your stay is the best it can be. Our room was lovely, clean and spacious. The hotel itself is very modern and up to date. We had room service breakfast a couple of mornings and it was really nice. We also went down to the bar one night for a few hours, although it was pricey the drinks were really nice and worth visiting. I have never seen a cocktail list like the one they had before! I would definitely recommend this hotel & return again when we next visit London!",5,2021,09,12

- Two minute walk from major attractions (Piccadilly Circus, one minute from the Mall)
- The room was wonderful.  First time I have stayed somewhere where I have been quite happy to hang out in the room. Beautiful colour scheme, high quality furnishings
- The Staff!

After 18+ months without a break due to COVID, I went all-in and booked a fancy hotel in the heart of London.  It was a great decision and we were saddened to leave so soon.  I plan to return.

I can't say enough about how welcoming the staff were.  These guys know how to make you feel at ease;  professional people who wanted you to have a great stay with them.",5,2021,09,01

126,Weekend break made exceptional by Sofitel St James,"We are a large family group and recently booked into the Sofitel St James for the bank holiday weekend. From the outset of booking through to arriving, staying and leaving, all the staff at the hotel were amazing; helpful, polite and very friendly. They were completely accommodating of our large group at breakfast ( dealing kindly with the different times of arrival of members of our group) and in the bar in the evening. The breakfast food is tasty, served hot and of sufficient size to be filling. A special mention is needed of the vegan breakfast menu which is extensive. The bar area is relaxed with a nice atmosphere and attentive staff. We took five rooms for our group and all of them were clean, spacious and well equipped, The water was always hot and the water pressure good! The bed was comfortable and the mini bar and tea and coffee well stocked. Every member of staff we interacted with either really enjoyed their work or was good at giving the impression they did, as they were all friendly and very welcoming. We intend to make the Sofitel St James our base for future trips to London and cannot recommend it highly enough. A very big thank you to all the staff for making our trip so enjoyable.",5,2021,08,30

From the very first moment we saw Sofitel and met with Sephora, we knew this would be the place where we our dreams will become reality. Sephora's down to earth, friendly and professional approach was an added bonus. We knew we could trust her and work alongside. The venue is an intimate and comfortably holds about 100 guests (our wedding). We had a package that suited our budget and had options to make this bespoke. Everything from start to finish was amazing. Our other suppliers praised Sofitel and all their staff, we must say Sephora, Ibrahim and Manon were amazing. I am sure there were many others. Absolutely recommend and crazy amazing photos too. We went to Pall Mall for a few shots. PERFECT! Thank you so much. 

We would love to try out Sofitel Spa and definitely will be back!",5,2021,08,04
126,Excellent stay,"Another fantastic stay at this hotel. We find this location to be excellent with easy access to the city centre, beautiful buildings around and St. James' park across the street for walks. Room was fantastic as was the food, and the bed was incredibly comfortable, but the outstanding aspect was the warm welcome and flawless service from every one of the staff we encountered throughout our stay. Hard to think how it could have been any better.",5,2021,07,29
126,Excellent experience and perfect wedding day!,"My husband and I are absolutely delighted that we could host our wedding at Sofitel St James Hotel! Everything was totally perfect and we are so, so happy and greateful! 

All the staff was so lovely, kind and caring, definitely the best! They have all made our stay excellent and helped us organise the most special wedding day! 
Since our arrival, everyone has made us feel so welcome and special and they have cared for every details, from helping us with the luggages to reserving tables for us in the hotel restaurant!

Before our wedding day, we stayed at the hotel as well and we had a lovely day in which we made use of the hotel's facilities, private jacuzzi, steam room and had an incredibly good and relaxing 90 minutes couple massage. 

Our room was so beautiful, there was a coffee machine, a kettle, a mini fridge full of fresh beverages, there were lots of snacks and different types of tea bags and coffee pods. 
Everything we needed was there and if we have additional requirements, the staff was always so nice and fast to helps us with anything!

The staff at the restaurant was also so kind and made us feel so special, checking on us frequently to meet our needs while having breakfast/lunch/dinner. The food was so good, from the cacio and pepe pasta (thank you so much Marina for the lovely suggestion :) ) to the
delicious desserts, and everything was served in the most beautiful ways! - Thank you so much for everything!!

Sephora has done an incredible job organising our wedding, in every single details, from preparation to execution, and she has also helped us with streaming our wedding day to our families in Italy since they could not be here due to covid restriction. Thank you so, so much for going the extra mile for us!
 
Our wedding day was absolutely perfect! The room for our ceremony was so elegant and lovely arranged, and the reception room after the ceremony was even more beautiful! 
- The magnificent flowers assortment - thank you so much Raffaella for this!, 
- the food - everything was delicious! thank you so much to the Chef and for the lovely menu testing prior to our wedding - it was so hard to choose as everything was so tasty!
- the 2-tier cake with the most elegant flower decorations- specially made for us,
- the wine and champaign!
- the lovely and friendly waiting staff - thank you so much for making us feel special and at home!
- the photographer - an absolute blast! thank you so much for all the cool picture ideas/poses and for bearing with us :)
- the music, the dancing
- the fun! 
Everything was a dream and we are really super greatful for all you have done for us. 

Thank you, thank you, thank you!",5,2021,07,28
126,The best service!,"The staff all offered service above and beyond what was expected. personally written card from reception, champagne from the spa staff and more. Made our stay feel incredibly special. Hotel itself was gorgeous and the central location made it perfect for exploring. Even though our room overlooked the square, it was very quiet during the night. 
I would recommend this hotel unreservedly.",5,2021,07,21
126,Can't recommend highly enough. Incredible hotel and staff. PERFECT,"I have previously reviewed this hotel a couple of years ago but wanted to write another after our second trip last weekend because the experience was so good.

The hotel is perfectly located for exploring London on foot; Buckingham Palace less than 10 minutes, China town and covent garden 25-30 minutes, Picadilly circus and Regent street 3-5 minutes. 
We also took a couple of taxis which we found reasonable. £18 to London zoo and £45 to Heathrow using Addison Lee. 

Despite it only being our second visit we were welcomed like old friends with the receptionist Vanicia noting it was my wife's birthday and our wedding anniversary and asking if we had any plans for the following day. We said we were going to London zoo and then out for afternoon tea and thought nothing more about it. As it was very early she offered us a coffee while we waited for our room. After a few minutes it was and we were told our luggage was already up there. In the room itself we found a welcome note and some birthday cake which we thought was a very welcome gesture. 
The room itself was spacious with a couple of chairs, a table and large TV. It had the comfiest bed we have slept in for a long while and was all immaculate and well appointed. There is a separate bath and shower which again was spotless.
After a bit of sightseeing we returned to the room and found a Rainforest  cafe notepad and bookmark with a handwritten note from Vanicia wishing us a pleasant trip to the zoo and asking us to use the notepad to record our memories of the day so we would have a keepsake. We can not (and we have tried) put in to words how much that act of kindness and thoughtfulness meant to us. The following morning she spotted us going in to breakfast and made a point of popping in to wish my wife a happy birthday and a pleasant trip to the zoo. As she was not on duty when we checked out we left a thank you note for her but it would have been nice to thank her in person again.
We ate evening meal and breakfast in the restaurant and had drinks in the bar and at all times were made to feel welcome by friendly and professional staff who maintained social distancing and Covid measures. 
At all times when we walked through the lobby we were always greeted and offered help with taxis or information. Always with a smile and a sense of genuineness. 
I know this review rambles on a bit but I cant express enough how impressed we were by our experience again, especially by Vanicia.
Without hesitation I would recommend this hotel. We have changed our plans for later in the year so we can stay here again.",5,2021,07,21
126,Excellent stay at a quiet time for hotels in London,"I stayed 15 nights at the Sofitel St James, partly my 5-day quarantine and partly work and family meetings.  It was excellent as always.  It's a very elegant but understated hotel and I don't think they were terribly busy (maybe 30% full then as things were only just opening up).  I stay there regularly and there was the usual excellent service from the front desk and the concierge and they set my room up so I could isolate for my 5 days and then go about my normal business.  The restaurant was closed 2 nights a week and the same for the bar (different days) but the concierge was able to suggest some very good places in Jermyn Street.  
Overall, given the situation with Covid the hotel did an excellent job in looking after its guests just as it did in Pre-Covid times.  It's still my favourite hotel in London.",5,2021,07,18
126,One night stay,"Excellent welcome. Lovely spacious room and facilities. Bed was so comfortable and the room fantastically quiet considering we were in the heart of London. Nice heavy curtains for a dark room. 
One thing - the towels were thin and too small for a premium hotel.
Overall great stay and we would revisit.",5,2021,06,30
126,Give this hotel a giant miss.,"Terrible experience with the best thing I can say about the hotel is  literally the modern toilet.

Having paid over £680 for a single night stay in their prestige suite, I actually booked 2 such rooms, I found the service and value for money absolutely disgusting.

The dinner menu in the ‘Wild Honey’ restaurant was very limited and some of the items we ordered never even arrived.

Breakfast was little different to dinner with the service little short of chaotic. Having paid over £680 a night for each room we did not expect to be charged for breakfast, we were! 

Would I stay here again, in words of one syllable NO!",2,2021,06,27
126,Luxury in the West End,"In these strange times it was so refreshing to experience “near-normality” in this premier hotel, fabulously-located in fashionable St James in the West End. Scrupulously clean, unfailingly efficient and polite staff, for whom nothing is too much trouble.",5,2021,06,22
126,"Amazing Hotel, Staff, Service - From Stay to Wedding.","Sofitel St James exceeded our expectations for our wedding celebrations. Sephora is exceptional - she saw our vision for our wedding and helped us execute it, attentive to detail, efficient and courteous communicator and all round lovely person (patient, kind and considerate). Our vendors also highly praised Sephora for her great service and communication with them. We also have to note Ibrahim, Minuit and the rest of the team, who are amazing, supportive and wonderful. 

Our reception was held in the Westminster Suite, which was exquisite. The food served was great - catered to all the needs of our guests which was amazing. 

We also stayed at the hotel for two nights, which was excellent each day. Every staff member was attentive, catered to our needs, helped us fulfill vendor requests and made our stay comfortable. Breakfast was divine - it is a must try! 

If you are planning a wedding and looking for a five star hotel, Sofitel St James will provide you with impeccable service. It was a stress free experience from start to finish - My husband and I will do it again if we could. Thank you Sofitel St James for making our wedding a beautiful experience and one with lasting memories in the midst of the pandemic.",5,2021,06,20
126,lovely service,"we had a wonderful dinner and were looked after perfectly by Marina. She worked very hard and brought great energy even in heavy rain!

the food was very good - gazpacho and some burrata. also the radicchio.",5,2021,06,16
126,Birthday Weekend,Thank you team Sofitel for making my husbands birthday a memorable one.My son was overwhelmed with the amities that were set up for us before arrival.The staff is very welcoming and we were looked after very well.Lovely hotel to stay with a best location.Just few minutes walk to all the attractions.Thank you once again.,5,2021,06,05
126,Birthday celebration,"What an amazing welcome 
Thanks to Sofitel team 
I was here for my birthday celebration with my family ,we have enjoyed our stay throughout 
What a thoughtful amenities just wow 🤩 
Hotel is located heart of London ,all attractions are nearby from hotel 
We been looked after very well 
Thanks to Sofitel team again",5,2021,06,05
126,Quality staying,"My son’s birthday is coming soon, so we stayed at this lovely hotel for an night, the check in was simple, had dinner at the restaurant, all the staff was very good. Had a quick drinks at the bar, again it’s pleasant. The breakfast was one of the best one that I’v ever had at hotels. Most importantly the GM  was hard working, professional, she helped the restaurant Friday evening and breakfast Saturday morning, she didn’t have to but she did. Overall, it was a quality stay for us, thank you!",5,2021,06,05
126,Excelant Service,"We have been to  this hotel several times to visit the resturant and bar. We have not  stayed in the hotel. The hotel had tables outside beacouse of the Covid 19 restrictions. The service  by Jaja and Marina was truly impeccable. We had delicious chardonnay, enjoing the sun. Whilst we were talking to Jaja the waitress, there was a little wine left in the bottle, so I said please pour it to my wife glass, my wife said no, its your birthday so pour it to his glass. After a short while the waitress returned with a cake and macarons with fruit and a candle. What a nice touch. Truly delightful. Thank you.",5,2021,04,24
126,A bit of a disappointment,"Firstly I have to be clear - this is a 3 star review based on my expectations and experience of other 5 star hotels. This is a very nice luxury hotel in a great location. My experience just fell significantly short. One night stay using points and so I did not pay $ for this - If I had, I would be EXTREMELY unhappy!
Staff were almost all very good.
I was in a prestige suite - very nice size and very comfortable. First issue was with neither of the phones working properly so used speaker phone until that failed too. I then realized that the power switch on the sockets had been turned off. It took several phone calls and challenges where the staff had to call me back, yet no-one ever came to the room to investigate or help, although I solved it after about 4 challenged calls. 
After a great sleep in a nice bed I woke up and looked for slippers (don't like to walk bare foot in hotels) - there were none (2 robes, but no slippers). I then went to make coffee with the Nespresso machine - this did not work at all, would not turn on. I looked for plug to check the same issue as the phone was not the case, but couldn't find it. Called front desk to tell them and order coffee and slippers. Coffee arrived - not very good quality (prob worst I've had in a luxury hotel), but no slippers. Asked the staff member about slippers - he had no idea, but came back later with some.
Superb location, lovely staff and very comfortable, but based on this experience I would definitely not pay anywhere near the rate for this hotel.",3,2021,03,08
126,short  stay in Sofitel London,"This hotel is nothing short of superb, the staff greeted us before we got in and made us feel very special from that moment onwards. The room was ready early and we had been upgraded due to our 
status with Accor. The staff always make the difference and they couldnt have treated us better. The room was exquisite and very very comfortable . We would recommend this hotel if staying in London its far abopve the rest ",5,2020,11,04
126,Anniversary event,"We booked the hotel to celebrate our Wedding Anniversary.  In these strange times we could not have asked for a warmer welcome, we were treated like royalty and every member of staff made us feel incredibly welcome.  The service was outstanding, the hotel was covid ready, the food was amazing.  Can't wait for my next anniversary so we can come again.",5,2020,11,03
126,great place to stay,"the hotel is located in St, James an ideal location for walking around london. and just 248 paces from my london office. I was forced to stay here while our house is renovated ( actually gutted ) for two weeks and it is an absolutely fabulous stay. leaving the kids and better half with mum and dad, after a little over 8 hours on the road i arrived at around 10pm. even the late hour did not phase the staff and their pleasant Ness and helpfully incites where a welcome to a weary traveler. i was actually expected and greeted by name always a pleasant start.

the room itself was small but standard for a london city hotel, its modern amenities certainly helped. with lots of electrical points and sockets for the usual assortment of tech travelers seem to collect these days. 

the room.
I had a small junior suit., a king bed two side tables a small work desk, sofa, and coffee table, the room was well lit in the evenings and for a second-floor room remarkably quit ( witness the video) 
a few points when the room is serviced the master electric is turned of so if you have things charging ( or in my case my insulin cooler ) just know its not after you walk out. fortunately my bat back up works! i am sure a word would have solved this but since for me it was not a problem.

the Bed. 
i have said this before, split beds are not for single people who tend to roll around. the bed i had, is one of those that separate to create two singles. I hate them. i mean i really hate them. they always develop a dip, i always roll into it and then wake up with a sore back. having said that i did ask for it to be fixed and to be fair they did toot sweet, even offering me another room if it did not solve the problem. ( IT DID so whatever solution was implemented perhaps beforehand............)

Bathroom.
always fresh towels and amenities. clean and fresh. the bath was huge though i never used it, the water always hot. 

the bar. 
the minibar was a little disappointing, just the usual stuff no good whisky but i brought my own and the whisky shop is literally 5 minutes walk away. ( they delivered in 30 minutes :>) 

The restaurants.
My stay was during the covid crisis even so the lounge bar and restaurant did their very best, the food was excellent and staff top notch so thank you all!. we even had a little fun with an impromptu whisky tasting one evening. while the lounge is small it is a pleasant place to sit and you have to try the burger and fries. and just let the staff bring you something. ?( i actually asked for something) its a nice surprise to not know what you are going to taste.

overall.
a great hotel. and great staff who go out of their way to be pleasant and helpful.",5,2020,10,27
126,An Exceptional Hotel,"It was our first visit to the Sofitel London St. James and it will definitely not be our last. A lovely friendly welcome, unbelievable location, outstanding cleanliness and really lovely service and staff. Thank you so much to Romane and Nikolas in particular for making my birthday trip so memorable.",5,2020,10,11
126,Surprised,"I always wanted to stay here and my boyfriend surprised me for one night.
I loved it! Not only did I get engaged but also the bar and restaurant were amazing!
In the bar with the passport menu (that I wanted to try for a while) really got me and I'll definitely go back.
There are alcohol sanitizer dispensers everywhere and the welcome drink was really pleasant.
Breakfast was gooooood, I love breakfast!
I want to thank Sofitel team mostly (and I apologize I'm sure I will get it wrong) Romane?! For helping my boyfriend, now fiancé, to organise the surprise and making our stay so great and making us feel very special, not only me but him as well :) 

Ps: ask for caneles!! Oooh they are absolutely amazing, I could do eat it all day.",5,2020,10,06
126,"Rest, recuperation and escape!","We booked a stay here as all our holidays abroad had been cancelled and from our previous stays at Sofitel St James we knew it would be good. We much appreciated the calm and the great care taken by all staff to make our stay safe -  wearing masks all the time, the sanitiser all around, allowing us to choose our housekeeping and turn-down times (or to have none), good distancing in the restaurant and bar, sanitising of our luggage, excellent and prompt room service.  Although our stay was only 3 days, after all the stress of lockdown it felt so much longer.  We felt pampered and looked after. The staff are the best of the best.  I never need an excuse to visit this hotel, but this stay was so good I will be planning my next stay even sooner",5,2020,10,01
126,Amazing service in a stunning hotel,"From the time of the booking until we left everything was perfect.Kasia who looked after our reservation made a note that it was my son first time in London and he had a lovely welcome card & gift waiting for him in the room.Room was very spacious and super clean.We felt very safe with all the Covid measurements in place.The breakfast was very tasty, it was served from A la Carte Menu(with plenty of vegan choice) and Daniel made sure we received promptly what we ordered.Thank you Sofitel team!",5,2020,09,28
126,Amazing stay!,I absolutely love staying at sofitel st James. Amazing atmosphere. Lovely staff. Great location. Amazing food and drinks. Had such an amazing time even though I was there for work. Very safe and miraculously clean. Can't wait to come back for another stay.,5,2020,09,21
126,Excellent,"Our 2nd stay at Sofitel on the 29th Aug. This is a superb hotel and the staff really make a difference from the moment you pull up outside. Swift check in, excellent room and a great breakfast. The bar is also very nice. Our number one option in central London.",5,2020,09,08
126,Good high class hotel,We chose to stay at the Sofitel for a couple of nights. The standard as you would expect from a Sofitel was very good and all the staff were excellent. The hotel its self was quiet with the exception of lunchtime in Wild Honey which was pretty busy on the restaurants reopening day.  Breakfast was excellent and the room very comfortable and quiet . Covid practices were very good and we felt very safe.  All the staff wore masks their were plenty of hand sanitisers around the hotel and one on every table in the restaurant. We had a lovely stay and would pick the hotel again.,5,2020,09,05
126,A perfect central London 5 star hotel - and in the evening -very quiet,"Outstanding service and well set up to safeguard guests during Covid 19.
I would have no hesitation in recommending this hotel, 4th floor or higher, nearer the Pall Mall end.
Spotlessly clean and very friendly and professional staff. Will be re visiting very soon,
Very good for business breakfasts, central but quiet. 200 yards of so from Piccadilly Circus and close to Buckingham Palace. Nearest tube Piccadilly.",5,2020,08,30
126,As lovely as ever!,"We had not stayed at the Sofitel St James for over 5 years but decided to treat ourselves for our planned trip to London to coincide with our anniversary. We were absolutely delighted with our decision. From the moment we arrived we were made welcome. The room was excellent, the breakfast likewise and nothing was too much trouble for the charming staff. We were even set little puzzles to solve - perhaps because we had told them we were planning to do a Treasure Trail one day. The prize was a drink voucher! If you want superb service with a touch of luxury, this is the place. We will be back!",5,2020,08,28
126,Still luxurious and very safe!,"We visit this hotel often, indeed had to cancel a visit in the first weekend of lockdown. It was therefore with delight to be able to go again so soon after it had reopened. And boy, it has gone through a major refurbishment and was looking even more fabulous than before but still the same look and feel. It was so lovely to see the same bank of flowers and the same friendly staff. But crucially, it felt safe, really safe. I speak as someone who is more than moderately anxious about C19 so it was really reassuring to see and hear about the precautions that they have taken for all our safety. Well done all and thank you all at the Hotel.",5,2020,08,25
126,Last minute weekend away.,"Booked a last minute weekend away here with my kids. Hotel was lovely with a great location for a bit of sightseeing. But the biggest thing I would like to review is the staff. They were fabulous and could not do enough for us. Right from taking my booking through  to getting a taxi for us back to the train station, extremely attentive. Looking forward to a future visit here and would highly recommend.",5,2020,08,23
126,I liked my stay,"I used to visit this hotel on a regular basis about 15 years ago.  I underwent a major overhaul.  The property is stunning.  As Accor platinum member, I was kindly upgraded to a slightly better room than the one booked.  The room was extremely comfortable with nice Hermès products.  We had tea at the tea room which was quite lovely.  The major difference between my stays 15+ years ago and my recent stay is the service.  I cannot say I found the same level of attention and care that this hotel used to provide.  It's a shame but I can tell they are making efforts to feel visitors welcome.  Just not in the same professional way as they used to (for example, staff is very insistent on asking what you will be doing during the days, you get text messages from them during the day, check-in details were completely wrong - we booked 2 rooms and one check-in card had the details of a complete random visitor ; they said it's ""ok to sign"" ; no, it's not.
As it was my birthday I did appreciate the small cake when I returned to my room.
Overall, a wonderful experience but I wonder if I will not choose The Savoy next time.",4,2020,07,26
126,Amazing hotel,"We stayed here for one night, we were in London for a show and this hotel was close to the theatre hence booking it. As soon as we walked it it was just lovely, greeted by polite staff, hot towels and smiles, check in was super easy and they were all extremely helpful. The hallways and landings smelt lovely and were super clean and the room was the same. It was quiet in the room, spotless and the bed was very comfy. We went to the bar for drinks and they went above and beyond to make sure we were happy with our chosen cocktails and the olives and nuts were an added bonus. We didn't eat there as we just didnt have time but we will be coming back again and will deffo be trying the restaurant. If your looking for somewhere clean, friendly and close to everything within walking distance this is your place.",5,2020,03,08
126,Perfect Location for access to London’s best,"My first time that I have stayed at this hotel and I will be back. Quiet rooms, comfortable beds and exceptional staff. I could not fault this place for my short stay. Close to Piccadilly Circus and the underground, with Regent St and Jermyn St close by. To top it off, my favourite breakfast place, The Wolsey is just around the corner !",5,2020,03,07
126,Super nice,"Super nice and personal service, beautiful room (I had the lowest category, but still), Paul Smith design, Hermès amenities, excellent food (checked out St. James Bar and breakfast only), great location (central but totally quiet). Very hard to beat. Well worth a stay, for business, but also for a great holiday!",5,2020,03,05
126,Elegance with excellence,"Great hotel, location, staff and amount all “excellent quality of services”

126,Wonderful hotel; Great location; Friendly and helpful staff,"The Sofitel St. James is a wonderful place to stay while in London.  The location cannot be beat.

126,Catching up with old friend,"My college friend was in town and put up in St James Sofitel.The evening started with a drink at St James bar. The hotel's interior decor is sprawled with modern arts. The bar nice, warm, dark & cosy. I'd the Japanese Nikka Malt whisky; it was great. My friend had the Bordeaux wine which can never go wrong. We had the delicious tempura cod. The drinks were served with complimentary green / black olives & nuts. Friendly staff; great service. Highly recommended!",5,2020,02,23
126,Most romantic and memorable stay,"Stayed for 1 night with my boyfriend for our anniversary and we were blown away by the kindness of all the staff. We had a very warm welcome from reception and Lea from Guest Services. We had the most beautiful room with a surprise cake for our celebration. Delicious cocktail in the bar, served by the amazing Ciprian, then dinner in the bar was so good and the food the chefs prepared was stunning!!! In the morning we agreed it was the best breakfast we have ever had. Thanks to all x",5,2020,02,12
126,Sofitel St. James,"Best Hotel/ Staff ever. Especially at the Reception / Consierge & the Bar! 
Service at the Breakfast Room could be better.
They prefer to deal with their electronic devices rather  than their Guests . Process??
We come back again!!!",5,2020,02,12
126,SPECIAL,"This Hotel is special, in the heart of London very convenient to any area, inside a wonderful building. I took a Luxury premium room, i asked for an high floor with city view, at my arrival last floor and view on the beautiful square in front, very nice care of customer. Bedroom has the right space with a lot of details ( for example nespresso) and very beautiful and comfortable bathroom. Insteriors space of the Hotel are luxurious and always perfect. Very good the bar on the ground floor, excellent cocktails and atmosphere, there are always many people but the super kind staff always find a table for you in a short time. I have not tried the Spa but i fix next time. If you are looking for an high level Hotel in London centre this is the solution",5,2020,02,11
126,"Great hotel, but small things are slipping","I love this hotel; “It’s A Great location and the rooms, while small, are quiet and comfortable. However, I’ve found standards to be slipping. Irons and ironing boards are not available in the rooms; when you ask for one, it’s hit and miss. A Business hotel like this must understand people need to press a suit or shirt.
So when I asked and none were available, the staff kindly offered to press my shirt and suit for me immediately, which was an acceptable alternative, even though I prefer to do this myself. I found £67 on my bill. I raised it to the staff twice, including the front office manager, and was assured it would be removed. On check-out it was still there.
The mini-bar in the room is locked and requires a visit from someone to come to unlock it. Really? At a hotel like this? Room turn-down was missed one evening after I asked the staff for 10 minutes to finish getting ready, and toiletries were not replaced on another day despite being empty.
Overall, a lovely hotel and still one of my favourites, but for the price you pay here, an iron and an ironing board is just basic. And small attentions to detail, for which Sofitel is so well-known, are slipping. It would be an easy 5 star if it weren’t for these things.",4,2020,02,08
126,Decadent Stay,"As parents of two yound children, nights away are a rarity so to go somewhere that feels special and luxurious is a real treat. We stayed for my wifes Birthday and the Hotel provided cake in the room, a free drink at the bar, and another cake at breakfast! We also go an upgrade on our room to a larger room which was a niec suprise. 

The furnishings in the rooms are first class with a modern feel. This is emphasized with great toiletries and a super powerful shower. The location is perfect just a few mins from Picadilly Circus so you right in the heart of the City. We ate at Scullys just around the corner which was also excellent. It's not cheap for sure, but if you want a treat and a proper 5 star Hotel Experience in London then book here.",5,2020,02,05
126,Brilliant stay!,"Fantastic service (never disappoints!), great hotel in a good and beautiful location. Clean and individually designed rooms. Very friendly and accommodating staff. As always, I really enjoyed my stay and look forward to coming back in the future! x",5,2020,02,04
126,"Sofitel St James, London","excellent place to stay, staff some welcoming, noting was to much trouble, customer service was excellent, would recommended the hotel  to all, great location and access to all attraction, tube station nearby which give good access to all of London",5,2020,02,04
126,Great location and excellent service,"I was on a training course and stayed at the Sofitel for 3 nights. At lunch on day 1, the hotel were not informed that I was vegan and did not have any warm food options. Not their fault. However, on day 2 as I walked up to the restaurant area, I was singled out by the staff (it was a buffet for everybody) and told that they will get my food. I was a bit surprised but sat at my table. Voila! The chef turned up with 3 dishes of vegan food and with a cheeky smile said I need to finish it all! The food was simply awesome and yes, I did stuff my face. I had some great options on day 3 too. The hotel location is brilliant. Step out and turn left to get to Buckingham Palace/Trafalgar square OR turn right and you are at Picadilly circus. There is a greak 5k loop starting and ending at the hotel if you have the running bug. Front office and other staff are all courteous and always treat you with a smile. What more could one ask for ;-)",4,2020,01,29

The bedroom was unique, clean, well decorated. 
The bathroom is very big. 

You have a lounge near the lobby where you can relax, enjoy the harp’ music.  

More than that the staff was waited on hand & foot, especially Adélaïde & Laura, two french girls whom did everything they can, so that we have the best stay. 

The staff works all the time so they are really available for the customers. 

The restaurant “Wild Honey” is genuine, a mix of french & English food. 

The breakfast is enormous, delicious. You can eat all the food you want. 
",5,2020,01,20

126,Love this hotel so nice,"Spent the night here to celebrate my birthday. Our room (512) was lovely really good bathroom with very clean walk in shower. A nice touch was a cake with a birthday card. We went for a drink in the bar and ordered our drinks (we sat at the bar) and my husband raised his glass to me and said quite quietly Happy Birthday. The barman overheard and said Happy Birthday and after five minutes presented us with a cake, complete with candle - such a lovely touch. The staff here are just brilliant and all seem to really care about giving good service. It really is a pleasure to stay here - comfortable beds, great location - easy to get to Covent Garden etc. Really enjoyed it - we will be back.",5,2020,01,19

the location is central near Piccadilly Circus.
the building itself is historic, the rooms are soundproofed and the bed is very comfortable, the staff is very kind. I fell home.",5,2020,01,17
126,"""The best holiday I ever had in my whole life"" (maman).","I'm not sure I'm able to explain how amazing was our experience in Sofitel Hotel St. James. The building is just ten minutes walking to Buckingham Palace, and five minutes to the National Gallery and the British Opera House. You can reach every attraction in the city in not more than fifteen or twenty minutes walking. This building is also recently renovated and, when we came in, we felt surprised by the ambience and the beauty of decor. Mrs Jessica welcomed us wonderfully and all the staff really took care of us during our stay in the best way ever. We want to thank also Mr. Julien, Mrs Annaelle, Mrs. Adelaide, Mr. Patrick, Mr. Tomas and Mr. Alberto that we've had the pleasure to met: we are so grateful to them for this amazing experience and we sincerely hope to come back again. 
Thank you for all.
Giselle and maman.",5,2020,01,14
126,Very Special Christmas Visit,"This was our first visit to London for the Christmas holidays for 8 years and we wasn't sure what to expect.  We upgraded our room upon arrival and there was so much more space and a separate bath and shower.  The hotel was decorated beautifully and felt very festive.  There were lots of extra touches; on my Birthday they left cake and a card and Christmas eve there was a stocking hung on the door with lovely edible gifts.  The rooms are exceptionally clean and the staff are all very accommodating and the guys on the door are aways very happy and helpful (even on cold and rainy days).  The only let-down, which i mentioned before is the cost of the bar (service charges)! 
With regards to London over the holidays.  We were very surprised how busy it was, with many pubs, starbucks etc open, which we didn't expect after reading reviews.
We will always stay at this hotel whenever we visit as aside from how fantastic the hotel is, the location is perfect!!",5,2020,01,13
126,Consistenly Impressive,"This was probably our 5th times staying at Sofitel St James. The hotel staff never fail to impress us from the check in to the check out process. We also been upgraded to Junior Suite during our recent stay and given late check out (we are a gold member All Accor). Having the flight cancelled for one night from Italy and get an upgrade at London gave us a high level of comfort and relief that we are looked after. I would also praise the concierge staff who worked exceeding my expectation by taking my lose snap button jacket to the repairer and get it done the next day. I would comfortably say Sofitel is my London ""home"". Some of our friends wondering why we like visiting London so often. One of the reason is because of the experience we had at Sofitel St James and we will return soon.",5,2020,01,12
126,It's all about their straff,"Regardless of the time of the day, a year or if you choose to go for a cup of tea or a delicious cocktail; here I was all the times welcomed with a big smile.  Today I've been looked after by Cipriano (probably one of the Biggest Stars behind the bar in London). So, a Big Thank You to you Sofitel St James and especially to you Cipriano.",5,2020,01,11

We definitely recommend the hotel to anyone who is looking for a pampering experience.",5,2020,01,09
126,Even better since refurbishment,"We’ve used Sofitels in many cities and this one has become one of their best. Our refurbished room was quiet, cosy and efficient, with a comfortable bed, good WiFi and USB charging for phones at the bedside. The table and upright chairs were ideal for room-service meals and the bathroom had a modern floor-level shower ideal for older guests. Staff throughout the hotel were cheerful, polite and helpful and remembered your name when you met them again.",5,2020,01,07
126,Wonderful place where hosts are spoiled !,"Definitely our favourite hotel in London. First, the location is ideal and the building is awesome but most of all, the team members make always their best to make your stay a real blessing.

126,Wonderful Christmas break in London,"Superb hotel for a multigenerational Christmas break in London. Faultless service from the doormen and bellboys, check in staff, restaurant service and housekeeping. The hotel has been recently lightly refreshed in terms of decor without losing its former charm and elegance. Amenities and spa are excellent but it is the courteous, authentic staff who made the stay worthwhile. No request was too hard, there was always a smile and a greeting and we were made to feel always welcome and valued. Merci! ",5,2020,01,03
126,Great location and worth returning to again and again,We have been to London about 20 times and have ended up at the Sofitel most often in recent years. We like the value of the medium sized rooms. The location is excellent. If you like to walk you can spend a week without using the underground. The staff are helpful and obliging. ,5,2020,01,03
126,Perfect.,"Excellent service from the hotel staff. Perfect location, central but quiet.
Delicious breakfast.
Cleanliness and comfort of the rooms. (They spent up to 2 times a day with an attention of bottles of water, snacks and coffee , tea.........",5,2024,08,17
126,One of the best in London,"The attention of the staff on admission, the friendliness of the manager and other staff is excellent and makes an enormous difference to other hotels. They strive to make you feel really good.
Besides, the beds are very comfortable and the rooms themselves, cheerful and modern. The value for money is very good.
The location is unbeatable!! 
It is a wise choice to stay as long as possible, as it does part of the rest.",5,2024,08,08
126,"Best location, top service","We were not at the Sofitel St James for the first time, but this time it was especially nice. The room we got exceeded our expectations and the friendliness of the service was remarkable. Worth mentioning is the service and hospitality we experienced in the evening in the bar. The conversation with the bar team somehow led to a gin tasting of the special kind that we will always remember best. This was BIG FUN....",5,2024,07,03
126,1. Election in London,"We stayed at this hotel as a couple a few years ago. 
Now with our teenagers too.

We'll be back...!",5,2024,05,15
126,Lovely stay in the best place in London,"The staff at the Sofitel London St James does everything possible to make your stay memorable.
The entire team and especially the Concierge knows at all times who I am, what rooms we are in and what our plans are, helping to resolve any situation or need. In less than 1 hour they resolved a last-minute car rental (my train to Manchester was cancelled) and managed to get the rental to bring the car to the door of the hotel.
Each and every one of them is special in their work. Being called by my name, by those I had not even met before was lovely.
Thank you to the entire team at Sofitel Londo St James. I will be back!",5,2024,04,15
126,Perfection,"Excellent hotel, it's worth all the five stars, the quality in everything, I recommend the breakfast because it's really excellent, staff always available and impeccable, a place to return to, a reference for my next trips.

126,Unbeatable Location,"We loved the quality of the service, the staff was extremely friendly and cordial. The location is unbeatable, it is very close to many tourist sites and emblematic streets, even walking you can reach Soho.
The hotel is impeccable and they take great care of every detail.",5,2023,08,13
126,"Ottima posizione, rapporto prezzo qualità discreto","Abbiamo scelto questa struttura per la posizione davvero comoda a piccadilly ma in una strada silenziosa. 
L’ hotel è di classe e il personale premuroso. 
La stanza che abbiamo preso una classic che risulta mediamente spaziosa ma il bagno senza finestra. 
Colazione abbastanza ricca , per essere un 5 stelle, con possibilità di prendere un piatto a la carte extra rispetto al buffet. 
La nota dolente è la spa che è praticamente una vecchia Jacuzzi mal funzionante e un bagno turco. Palestra piccola ma con buoni attrezzi.",3,2023,04,10
126,Nel centro di Londra,"Ottimo hotel, in pieno centro a due passi da Trafalgar square e Piccadilly, comodo alla metro, belle camere e ben insonorizzate, ottimo il servizio in camera , al bar i cocktail di Mario sono favolosi.",5,2023,03,26
126,Hermoso,"Un hotel lleno de buen gusto, elegancia y buen trato , desde que bajas del auto te reciben con todas las atenciones,  decorado elegantemente y cuidados todos los detalles para que tengas una estancia muy placentera, no es un hotel barato , y es digno de llegar a el cuando tengas una   Celebración especial y quieras sentirte en el confort y lujo, pero debes valorar qué clase de estancia  tendrás , si vas de viaje para conocer Londres y la mayoría del tiempo estarás en la calle y llegarás solo a dormir, valora el costo del hotel ,  a menos que tengas mucho dinero y eso no tenga importancia , es un hotel en que debes tener tiempo para estar tiempo ahí y disfrutarlo, que una noche ahí es una experiencia inolvidable en esas habitaciones y con todas las comodidades para un excelente descanso .  ",4,2023,02,05
126,INMEJORABLE,"EXCELENTE!! Atención excelente. Todos súper atentos y educados. 
Mejor desayuno que he comido en todos los hoteles 5 estrellas que he estado. Impresionante calidad y variedad. 
Las habitaciones son muy cómodas y amplias. Los colores son fuertes pero esta bien. Las fotos de la página no favorecen.",5,2022,06,08
126,"Spitzen Lage, tolles Team","Wir übernachteten zum 2. Mal hier - diesmal mit unserer Tochter. Wir bekamen ein tolles Zimmer mit Blick auf den Waterloo Pl. Es konnte sogar für uns gem. meiner vorherigen Anfrage - schon ab 12.00h bereit gestellt werden. Die renovierten Zimmer gefallen uns richtig gut. Über die Cookies und den Saft freute sich unsere Tochter. Betten sehr bequem, alles sehr sauber. Heisswasserbereiter und Kaffeemaschine auf dem Zimmer - dazu noch kostenloses Wasser in Flaschen - kein Plastik - sehr gut. Tolles Bad - ich liebe diese Armaturen! Als sehr ängstliche Gäste hat uns sehr gefreut, dass im Hotel weiterhin Maske getragen wird.  Wir hatten kein Frühstück im Hotel und auch den Welcome Drink liessen wir ausfallen, da wir uns derzeit nicht so gerne in geschlossenen Räumen zum Essen/Trinken mit anderen aufhalten. Das machte uns aber nichts aus. Gäbe es hier im Hotel noch einen Pool - wäre es perfekt. Die Kommunikation per WhatsApp mit dem Team klappte auch dieses Mal wieder sehr gut. Wir wurden auch früh genug auf den Streik der Bahnen hingewiesen und konnten früh genug ein Taxi organisieren zum Flughafen. Wir haben uns rundherum wohl gefühlt und werden auf jeden Fall wieder kommen. Vielen Dank - besonders an den netten Doorman - Merci!",4,2022,03,03
