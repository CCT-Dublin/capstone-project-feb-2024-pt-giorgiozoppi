145,Great location but not what we expected.,"Not what I expected from the Amex Hotel Collection. The highlight of our hotel stay was Tony, the doorman! He made us feel welcomed and special-he is a huge asset to this hotel!!! At check-in we were not able to get a room upgrade for either of our 2 rooms. The main elevators were not working so we had to use the service elevator during our visit. This elevator is used for hotel guests and patrons of the rooftop restaurant. The room was nice but the shower was extremely small. The bed was okay but didn't have a top sheet, just a duvet. They offered complimentary bottled waters which was nice. The complimentary breakfast was good but the restaurant is very cold. They do have heaters and blankets though. We enjoyed the rooftop terrace for drinks and appetizers. The view is beautiful but we skipped on dinner since the staff seemed very busy. I'm sure my review would be better if the hotel construction was finished but it definitely interfered with our experience.",3,2024,10,16
145,"Perfect Location, Excellent Service!","Our first trip to London could not have started out any better than our stay at The Trafalgar St. James. Almost everything about this hotel was perfect for our needs.
This hotel is perfectly located for those who want to visit the local must see landmarks such as Westminster Abbey and Buckingham Palace. Both of those are in within 10 to 15 minutes walking distance from the hotel. Also, close nearby are the many theaters that make up London's theater district. In fact, we saw a performance of ""Ain't Too Proud"" at the Prince Edward Theater, and walked to the show from the hotel.
The excellent location of the hotel is matched by the excellence of the hotel's staff. All of the staff members we encountered were very friendly and eager to help make our stay comfortable. In fact, my interaction with the hotel started before we even arrived. 
Prior to arriving, I contacted the concierge desk to arrange for transportation to the hotel from the airport, and from the hotel to the cruise port in Southampton. Daniel and Mike at the concierge desk were quick to help make such arrangements. Both were very friendly, knowledgeable and helpful. Their help was very much appreciated. This high level of service was indicative of what was to come.
As I stated before, all the staff members were friendly, helpful and made us feel welcome. We particularly appreciated the cheerful welcome provided by the doorman, Tony.
A daily breakfast buffet is available, as is a regular breakfast menu. There was a very good selection of foods to choose from. As a Hilton Diamond member, this was provided as an Honors benefit. The quality of the food at the buffet is probably the best that I have had at a hotel. The service provided was excellent.
We stayed in a St James King Room. The room had ample space, the bed was very comfortable, and the HVAC system performed well.
The room was very nice, but had one very odd feature: the sitting area is separated from where the bed is located by a rise in elevation of three steps. You can see a picture of this on the hotel's website.
Having to walk up and down the steps when traversing the room became tiresome and annoying over the course of our stay. Because there is no railing around the higher level, it could be dangerous. I had thought about lowering my rating of the hotel because of this design issue, but decided not to. The overall quality of my experience at the hotel outweighed my feelings about the strange room design.
I would definitely choose to stay at this hotel again if and when I am fortunate enough to return to London. Almost everything about this hotel was excellent. I will probably, however, choose a different type of room.

145,London Rocks!!,"OUTSTANDING customer service from the moment our jet legged selves walked in.  Staff was great and the Concierges, Michael & Gabriel helped us make the most of our time.  Our room overlooked the square and it was soooooo quiet, just the way I like it.",5,2024,10,13
145,A Gem Located In The Heart of London!,"This is our second stay at The Trafalgar St. James, and plan to return again, and again.  What a wonderful Gem of a hotel! A beautiful place!  We came for the location, and stayed for the experience .  The staff is pleasant and accommodating, the hotel is clean, service is tip top. Tony, the doorman is full of charisma and absolutely superb! What a great asset he is  to the hotel.  It was nice to be remembered by him, the minute we stepped out of the taxi. He’s extremely helpful, and amiable. Our favorite part of the stay besides, the clean, comfortable rooms, and smart power shower, was breakfast. We’ve stayed at many nice hotels across the globe, but my husband and I both agree that there’s no better breakfast spread than that of the Trafalgar St. James.  Delicious, awesome variety, in a clean environment with nice ambiance and great Chefs. Just wonderful!  Their berry compote is worth an honorable mention, although everything was delectable. Our greeter Rayssa was most delightful, and genuinely bubbling with positivity and good cheer. Just the personality you want to encounter at the start of your day. Rob, our server is skilled with efficiency and a quiet charm. He has such a nice spirit that’s pleasant to experience. He’s humble, kind, and very observant. He remembered with accuracy our order from day one. We didn’t have to remind him the next time. 
The roof top restaurant is lovely. The view is breathtaking. Great for selfies!  
Although we highly recommend the 
Trafalgar St. James, don’t take our word for it. Go see for yourself.",5,2024,10,10
145,Great stay and location!,"Terrific stay- staff was extremely helpful and attentive.  Location is fantastic.  Ate at the rooftop restaurant which had great food, service and style. Room itself was clean and modern, fresh flowers even on the tables!  Highly recommend for business or pleasure stay.",5,2024,10,08
145,Extraordinary!,"We had an absolutely Wonderful stay! The hotel is perfectly and centrally located, our room was comfortable, clean, and full of amenities such as complementary soda, water, coffee, tea, and biscuits which were restocked every day. The hotel breakfast is absolutely incredible! 
The staff were all professional, thoughtful, and extremely helpful. There were so many that helped us but Rayssa really stood out—she actually recognized and greeted us by name every day of our stay, no matter where we happened to see her in the hotel!",5,2024,10,07
145,A lovely Holiday Experience....,"The staff is friendly, helpful, and everything you could hope for in a hotel experience.  The room was excellent, tidy, and spacious.  Easily the best room and restful sleep I have experienced in my travels throughout the UK. The Rooftop bar is a great perk too. Perfect after a long day wandering England.",5,2024,10,04
145,"Exceptional service, exploration of new culture and history!","So 1st I want to thank the staff here for my 1st trip to England they made my whole trip...the views, the food, the comfort, and decor were all so extraordinary, Michael was so helpful with directions and location of everything and so personable, Rob our waiter every morning was so friendly and helpful, the Hostess Rayssa was so kind and happy, I have bragged to my own co staff at a Hilton in Texas and strive for the same excellence! Thank You London for your service and extraordinary kindness! If you want to experience London this is definitely the best way to do so!!",5,2024,10,02
145,Amazing,"Visited the rooftop for business dinner and it was fantastic! Service was great from the moment I walked in- concierge and reception downstairs greeted with smile and cheerfulness. Food was lovely, service was great - highly recommended and will be back !!",5,2024,09,28
145,"best stay in London, UK","this hotel stands out, friendly, very accommodating staff,  rooftop cafe and bar is the best, great views friendly and efficient staff, good food and drinks,  the rooms are comfortable and bedding is great, shower floor is a bit slippery, but overall easy to use,  thumbs down on free WIFI, never could get it to work on my iPhone or ipad, the hotel location is most convenient to everything, several good restaurants close by, theatre district close both bus and tube stops within walking",5,2024,09,25
145,The Doorman made our stay,Spent two weeks at the property and the standout was the doorman TONI.  I would see him at least 4 times each day.  He would greet  me each and every time and inquired how my day/stay was going.  He was there to offer suggestions and generally a smile at each interaction.  Thank you for making our stay memorable!,5,2024,09,22
145,Wonderful stay at the St James Trafalgar,"My wife and I recently stayed for 5 nights at the St James Trafalgar Curio Hilton and had a wonderful experience. As a Hilton Diamond member, our room was upgraded to a St James King Family room which gave us a little more space which was nice. The rooms very clean and nice.
The location is perfect and centrally located and within walking distance to Churchill War Rooms, Westminster Abby and Buckingham Palace just to name a few attractions. The team members were all extremely professional and helpful throughout our stay. Mike, the concierge, was awesome booking a couple of attractions/plays for us and our friends and he also gave some really good dining recommendations. 
We also enjoyed the daily breakfast at the Rooftop restaurant. As a Diamond, you get a complementary breakfast buffet or you can order off of the menu. It was a great way to start each day. We were fortunate to have Rob, our waiter for most of the mornings. Rob was always pleased to see us every morning and was very attentive and did an excellent job serving us. The Rooftop was also a nice place to have a glass of wine or drink at the end of the day to relax with the amazing views. 
The only slight negative of our stay was that the hotel is close to completely a renovation in the lobby and main level restaurant (they told us that it should be completed in November). Due to the construction, the lobby was very small and there were just two elevators. Again, it was not that big of deal and we understood the situation. I am sure it will look unbelievable when all completed.
We definitely would recommend the St James Trafalgar hotel for couples, families or anybody else. The rooms are beautiful, the location is second to none and the team members went over and beyond to make our stay memorable. When we get back to London again, we will be staying at the St James and we can't wait to see the new lobby and lower level renovations.",5,2024,09,21
145,Wonderful trip to London,"The hotel although under construction was great! All the staff were extremely helpful and more than happy to help with anything. 
The hotel room was wonderful huge bed and plenty of closet space also a large bathroom. Great view of Trafalgar Square and great amenities.
Roof top bar and restaurant had great service and food and of course the view was amazing!",5,2024,09,18
145,Great location and staff!,"Great location! Rooftop restaurant/bar had great views and served a wonderful breakfast and dinner.

Four nights and two great stays on both ends of our 18 day Europe trip!

The staff was friendly, helpful and accommodating.  Toni at the front door was especially helpful in so many different ways!!  He’s a great ambassador for the hotel!!

We will definitely stay here on our next visit!👍🏾",4,2024,09,17
145,Amazing Staff,"I recently attended an event at The Trafalgar St. James and accidentally left my jacket behind. When I came back the next day, no one was quite sure how to help at first, but the receptionist quickly called the manager. I believe her name was Sash or Yash, and she was absolutely amazing! She took the time to personally go and find my jacket, and within 5-10 minutes, she brought it back to me. Her customer service was outstanding – definitely a 5/5 experience!",5,2024,09,15
145,"The St. James in London, well worth the visit.","My wife and I went to London for the weekend to celebrate her birthday. We were taking in a show at His Majesty’s Theater, Phantom of the Opera, and afterwards had reservations at the St. James rooftop bar. To round out the evening, I had also made a reservation to stay at the hotel so that we did not need to take the train ride back to Oxford that evening. 

To our surprise, a knock at our door came with chocolates and a card telling us that our room had been upgraded and we were being provided with breakfast the following morning. 

From our first interaction with the front desk, until the cordial farewell from the doorman at our departure, we had a thoroughly enjoyable evening. My wife and I travel all over the world and have stayed at many fine resorts and hotels. The St. James provides the same, if not better, overall service and comfort that we would expect during any of our travels. We visit London at least monthly, and will keep the St. James at the top of our list.",5,2024,09,15
145,Excellent hotel on Trafalgar Square ,"Excellent place, superb service and unbeatable location. Rayssa, the breakfast greeter, was especially friendly. 

Everyone was friendly, the rooftop has a great view. They clean the room twice a day. They get to know you and always smile. 

",5,2024,09,15
145,Not the 5-Star Experience I Expected from Hilton,"This was easily the most disappointing hotel of my entire trip. The overall design, facilities and services felt far below what you’d expect from a hotel claiming to be 5 stars.

Pros:

-Friendly Staff: The doorman, Toni, was very kind and eager to help, which was one of the few positive aspects of this stay. The staff members we interacted with were generally pleasant and professional.
-Great Breakfast: The breakfast was excellent, offering a great blend of local and international options. It was definitely the highlight of our stay.

Cons:

-Room Upgrade Disappointment: As both a Hilton Gold member and AMEX Platinum cardholder, I’m entitled to a room upgrade if available. The hotel did recognize my memberships and offered an upgrade, which I appreciated, but the room I was given was not what I expected or wanted. I reserved a room with a King bed, but the upgrade they offered was to a room with two double beds and a view from the front of the hotel (just a building, not Trafalgar Square). While I appreciate the slightly larger room, I booked a King bed intentionally. Had I been told the upgrade would mean sacrificing the bed I requested for a little more space, I would have declined. As a 5 star hotel, I would expect a better version of the same room configuration and if one was not available then offer me what you have with an explanation of the differences. 
-Hilton Honors Recognition Misstep: While they did recognize my Hilton Gold status with a welcome card in the room, they only addressed it to my husband. I’m the Hilton Honors member, and the room was booked in my name. It would have been more appropriate to welcome me as the member or both of us as the room occupants, but acknowledging only my husband felt dismissive.
-No Space to Freshen Up: When we arrived early, our room wasn’t ready, which is understandable. However, they didn’t have any facilities for us to freshen up or access anything from our luggage before we headed out for an event. Additionally, despite knowing we were waiting and on a tight timeline because we had tickets for an event, they didn’t tell us when the room became available. We had to go back to the front desk to ask again, and only then were we informed that our room was ready.
-Lack of Proper Lobby: There is essentially no lobby, leaving us with no comfortable place to wait for our room or to spend time outside of your room in the hotel. 
-Cramped and Poorly Designed Bathroom: The bathroom was another major disappointment. The shower was claustrophobically small, making it difficult to move around, and there was no counter space to put out any of our things. Other hotels on our trip had towel warmers, which were a nice luxury, but this one did not, despite its supposed 5-star rating.
-Uncomfortable Room: The bed was extremely firm, and I struggled to sleep during our stay. The room itself was dusty, which was surprising for a hotel at this level. While they did provide bathrobes and slippers, they were scratchy and felt flimsy, almost as if they were disposable. It detracted from the luxurious experience I was hoping for.
-Limited Elevators and Construction Hassles: There seemed to be only one functioning elevator during our stay. Additionally, the construction around the hotel was a major inconvenience, and there was no mention of this during the booking process. The cranes and construction equipment mar the views from the rooftop restaurant, which is still a nice place to sit. They can't control the outside construction, but it significantly impacts the experience of staying here, so the hotel should be transparent about these issues with potential guests. They note that the restaurant is closed, but not any of the rest of it. 

I’ve stayed in plenty of Hilton properties and this one did not live up to its 5-star billing.  I’ve had better stays at lower-rated hotels. In fact, the next stop on our trip was a 3-star Holiday Inn, which was significantly better in terms of comfort, amenities and service. I trusted the Hilton name for a luxury experience, and this hotel simply did not deliver. I would not recommend it, especially considering the construction and many other great options in the area.",2,2024,09,14
145,Excellent Service Despite Minor Setbacks,"The staff were exceptionally friendly and went out of their way to provide outstanding service. Tony, the doorman, was especially helpful and friendly. Although the first room we received had an unpleasant odor, the team immediately apologized and promptly moved us to a different room with no hesitation. While part of the hotel was under construction, which did affect the overall experience, it wasn’t a major issue.

",5,2024,09,12
145,Great central location,"The Trafalgar was undergoing some renovations/constructions when I stayed so the lobby and elevator area is small and cramped but the room was very nice and pleasant. The front door person, Tony was great and I wish he was the person greeting us at every hotel! The rooms are quite spacious for London standard and the location was central and easy access to everywhere. I just wished that we were able to enjoy the cocktail bar/restaurant.  The rooftop restaurant was a cozy place for breakfast but the selection of items was okay.",4,2024,09,11
145,1st class experience,"Loved our stay here. My partner and I were in town for a wedding, our room was incredible (landseer suite) and every single person on staff went out of their way to make sure we were comfortable, had everything we needed. The room service meals were excellent. Most importantly everyone on staff were consistently really thoughtful, pleasant and every interaction with them was a pleasure/easy. We highly recommend staying here.",5,2024,09,10
145,Great experience celebrating a BIG birthday,"Outstanding service from the moment we entered to our sad departure.  We were celebrating my wife's birthday and they made it very special!  The whole staff was super friendly and we were authentically greeted many times throughout each day there.  The location to Trafalgar Square, other sites and access to The Tube was perfect.  The room had a super cool, Curio-ness about it....We loved our stay here..Bravo!",5,2024,09,10
145,Magnificent stay in London,"From the second we were greeted at the entrance to leaving the hotel 5 days later we were treated like Royalty. The service was excellent, the room was exceptional, great location and the rooftop bar and restaurant was wonderful. I would highly recommend The Trafalgar St James in London!!!",5,2024,09,09
145,Great experience!,"The staff at this hotel is genuinely the most wonderful I’ve encountered in a long time. I have Lifetime platinum status with Marriott, having been an ambassador for a number of years and I was very surprised to encounter both wonderful facilities, nicely appointed rooms and sincere and thoughtful service that went above and beyond what I would expect, particularly having no particular status with the Hilton hotel group. From Toni at the door who always helped and had a welcoming greeting and helpful information about anything you’d need to know on your trip to London, to the restaurant staff (I can’t recall the name of the new waitress who’s been there only two weeks, having moved from Leeds and did more than what would be expected to try to recognize and celebrate my birthday while there!), To the absolutely wonderful front desk staff and front of house manager. Even the housekeepers were friendly and helpful. 
This hotel was an unexpected gem – I will definitely stay there again! 
This is where you want to stay when you’re in London.",5,2024,09,09
145,1st trip to London,"Toni the doorman was extremely helpful, Kind and professional.  The staff here was amazing.  Although renovations are in progress, it did not negatively impact our stay.  I would definitely recommend this property based on location and great service from the staff.  Rooms were very good.",5,2024,09,07
145,Excellent Service,"The service was excellent and quite friendly throughout our stay and we had a very enjoyable  experience. Our person at the from desk was hospitable and accommodated an early checkin and a room upgrade as a Diamond HH member. The concierge was very helpful numerous times with guidance and restaurant reservations. Lastly, Toni the doorman was also helpful and always greeting us warmly.",5,2024,09,07
145,GREAT London hotel in heart of City,"Our hotel stay was phenomenal. My husband and I stayed for 5 nights here. EVERYONE at the hotel was extremely professional and accommodating. They made us feel VERY welcomed, assisted with plans, directed us on best way to get about, and ensured our stay was perfect. The breakfast is phenomenal, the rooftop bar fun, and the location is in the heart of everything. We were able to walk to almost all of the sites. And we were busy enjoying this beautiful city. They are doing improvements to parts of the hotel, but it didn’t negatively impact us in any significant way, and we were not bothered by any construction sounds. Great stay! I highly recommend.",5,2024,09,07
145,Construction beware,Beware hotel under construction in September despite website saying ends in August. Dark rooms facing construction tarps. Won't refund after you check in if booked via Amex platinum and won't change rooms (claim no availability). Personally I would avoid.,1,2024,09,07
145,"Great place,  please read","Very excellent service
Room was very clean,  well furnished and not old and damaged.  Bed was extremely comfy, not lumpy.  Shower and bathroom was clean and shower worked great,  no leaks or damage. I highly suggest the room with a view,  that was awesome to see the city square and happenings 

Tony the door guy was polite and friendly,  very helpful. So nice to have someone welcome you as that was the first stop on our trip.

Breakfast was awesome,  not just some fruits,  they had lots of hot choices, and it was great. The atmosphere was fantastic,  and each day was started off right.  I loved the Eggs Benedict!

Rooftop bar is also awesome with some great drinks.  The view up there overlooks most of the city,  definitely worth a night in. 

100% will stay here again.  The location was close to everything and we felt as if we were in the middle of it,  without all the noise lol.  

Thanks staff for taking care of us",5,2024,09,06
145,Great hotel in a fun location,This is our second trip to the UK and we wanted to stay in a different area but remain near the city center. We decided to try the Trafalgar St James. Despite the hotel renovations we enjoyed our stay and loved being steps away from the restaurants and fun sites! The rooftop restaurant and view was amazing! The hotel staff from the moment we arrived were wonderful! Ibtissam  was our morning server at breakfast and she was wonderful.,5,2024,09,06
145,Exceptional Service,"The Trafalgar St. James London is a hotel that has it all: prime location, beautiful rooms, a rooftop bar with amazing views, and a restaurant serving delicious food. These were all the reasons why we chose this hotel but what made it memorable and what compensated for the inconvenient construction inside was the exceptional service throughout our stay, from the doorman Toni to the hostess Zyuleyha and every day with housekeeping. The standout though was Rob who made our dining experience one of the highlights of our London trip.  We genuinely felt taken care of whether we were rushing through breakfast or indulging at a leisurely pace. From expediting our order when we were in a hurry to warmly welcoming us back the day after, Rob ensured a seamless and truly enjoyable time.  His thoughtfulness and attention to detail created an ease that is hard to come by for us with a child who has numerous food allergies. We're so grateful to have met such a team of people working at The Trafalgar St. James who made our London trip unforgettable.",5,2024,09,05
145,The Trafalgar St James,Place was under construction. Great location. Room was spacious. Bathroom stand in shower. Clean place restaurant was closed. Rooftop bar was great.

145,Definitely worth it.,The hotel was under construction but was still amazing.  They upgraded us to a double queen room which made life so much easier with our daughter.  We had a room by the street but we couldn’t hear any noise what so ever. The rooftop breakfast was the best I’ve had at any hotel in years.  The doorman Tony was the sweetest person and took care of us every time he saw us.  I would highly recommend.,5,2024,09,05
145,Wonderful Hotel Located in London’s Trafalgar Square!,"Trafalgar St. James is a beautiful hotel located in the center of Trafalgar Square, just steps away from Buckingham Palace, Westminster & Big Ben, River Thames, Covent Garden, Piccadilly Square and all the restaurants, pubs & shopping!

145,The Gold Standard for Curio Hotels,"Historically my favorite Hilton property, the Trafalgar still manages to exceed expectations every booking. It's obvious the staff take pride in this establishment, apparent from the meticulous maintenance and cleanliness of the facilities to the personallized and intimate service. Toby made our stay truly memorable. Thank you again for a phenomenal stay; our only regret is the inability to extend our visit.",5,2024,09,02
145,Awesome Experience ,"The Rooftop at Trafalgar St James is fabulous! One of our absolutely favorite spots when we come to London.

145,Amazing customer service,"This hotel is in an amazing position overlooking Trafalgar Square, which you get to enjoy from the rooftop restaurant , incredible at night especially. The rooms are absolutely brilliant, we were upgraded to a suite , and we were stunned when we opened the door, but what really stands out and makes this one of , if not the best hotel that we have ever stayed at was the stellar customer service , from the doorman outside to the front desk to the restaurant staff ,  to customer services they were all so friendly and attentive , and really made us feel so special. I cannot praise them enough , suffice to say , we will most definitely be making a return trip as soon as possible. I would give them more stars if I could.",5,2024,09,01

145,Hilton Hospitality,The hotel was  great. A fantastic location. One of the waitstaff at breakfast and in the rooftop bar is super. Very friendly and helpful. It was a genuine pleasure to get to know him during my stays.  He is a great example of Hilton hospitality and is part of what made the stay at the Trafalgar St James so memorable.,5,2024,08,28
145,"Quick trip. Under construction, but hotel was clean and extremely pleasant","Although there is a lot of construction going on, the hotel was very pleasant.  Reception is extremely clean and all staff were wonderful.  We were upgraded to a front facing king suite. The only bummer with the room is London is under construction so a lot of cranes workers on the street. 

The restaurant was closed, but the rooftop was open with a full restaurant menu for all meals. The food and staff were delicious. 

The view was perfect and the weather was amazing this trip.  

Toni (the door man) helped us on our departure and he was very professional and polite and waited for our car to help us get to the car with all the construction confusion.",5,2024,08,28
145,Stay anywhere but here!,"I would strongly advise against staying at this hotel.

My recent experience from July 12th to July 23rd, 2024, at what was advertised as a ""5-star"" hotel was deeply disappointing and far from the level of service and comfort one would expect. The issues began immediately upon arrival, with construction disrupting the entire property—something that was not disclosed on their website. When I raised this issue with the staff, they claimed that the construction notice was on the website, but I checked before booking and even after my stay, and there was no mention of it.

The check-in process was marked by poor service, with staff who appeared inadequately trained and unprepared to meet basic hospitality standards. As a frequent traveler, I expect a certain level of professionalism and courtesy, especially from a hotel that claims to be 5-star. Unfortunately, the service here fell drastically short. The fire alarms went off randomly without warning, and on one occasion, we were only notified in advance after the fact. There was no functioning front lobby due to ongoing construction; guests were directed to enter through a side entrance where the floors were torn up. With only two seats available in the makeshift lobby, if another party was occupying them, we were left to wait outside.

When I finally checked in, I was informed that my room was not ready and was told to take a walk with my family, including my 1-year-old daughter, despite the heat and humidity, after a long international flight. The staff did not proactively offer the room upgrade that my Hilton status entitles me to; I had to ask for it myself, which felt uncomfortable and unnecessary. Only after I insisted did they find an available room.

Upon entering the room, it was immediately apparent that this was not the luxurious experience one expects from a 5-star hotel. To add to the discomfort, a staff member walked in without verifying if anyone was inside, despite having knocked first. His abrupt entry was both intrusive and unsettling.

The construction noise was incessant, starting every morning around 10 a.m. for the duration of our stay. For families with young children or anyone hoping to enjoy a peaceful vacation, this environment is entirely unsuitable. The hotel attempted to move us to quieter rooms and eventually upgraded us, but the damage to our experience was already done. The fire alarm testing that occurred during our stay was another unnecessary disturbance, particularly when we were not notified beforehand, causing significant distress.

While the hotel is situated in a prime location, and the doormen were pleasant, these small positives were overshadowed by the numerous issues we encountered. Toby, the front desk manager, made an effort to rectify the situation, but it was too little, too late.

Given the state of the property and the poor service, I would never consider staying here again. The front desk staff, who are the first point of contact and represent the hotel, appeared disengaged and disinterested in providing a welcoming experience. The ongoing construction should necessitate closing the hotel to guests until it is complete, but it is clear that financial motivations take precedence over customer satisfaction. Guests are left to suffer the consequences, spending significant amounts of money only to be met with constant disruptions and subpar service.

To add insult to injury, 2 out of the 3 elevators were out of service, further complicating our stay.

In summary, this hotel fails to live up to its 5-star rating in every respect. I will be sharing this review, along with photos and videos, with my network of travel enthusiasts, friends, and family, and across all my travel groups. This experience has left me and my family feeling deeply disappointed, especially after waiting years and saving diligently for what we hoped would be a dream vacation. Instead, we were met with frustration and regret. I strongly recommend choosing another hotel for your stay.",1,2024,08,27
145,Wonderful hotel and staff,Fantastic hotel in the perfect location. The staff is so polite and helpful and the rooms are beautiful and very clean.  The rooftop bar is amazing and the daily breakfast was over the top delicious. Rob was our server every morning and got our day started off right with his friendly smile and eagerness to make our stay as enjoyable as possible.  I can’t recommend this hotel enough.,5,2024,08,27
145,Amazing breakfast,"Location cannot be beat. Breakfast is terrific. For American travelers: if you are used to ""Continental breakfasts"" at hotels in the US, know that it means something entirely different on (or near!) the Continent! Think: eggs, bacon, granolas, cereals, lattes, espresso, cheeses, fruits, etc. Terrific!",5,2024,08,26
145,I will be back!,"Amazing hotel!  I loved everything about this hotel from the rooms, to the staff, to the amazing rooftop!  I will be back!  Kudos to the staff who were amazing from check in to check out.  Lydia was amazing and made my stay delightful.  The hotel rooftop is a must, even just for a drink and the view!",5,2024,08,26
145,perfect stay,"we had a wonderful stay at the Hilton. 
the staff are so welcoming and helpful, the rooms are beautiful. 
Breakfast was stunning, we loved it. 
Toni, the guy who was on the door, could not do enough for us. He was a lovely gentlemen and we hope the Hilton are grateful he’s there. 

we had a perfect stay and will be back at christmas.",5,2024,08,26
145,Highly recommend,A Hilton gold member and this was one of the best hiltons I have stayed at in a while. I got a nice upgrade during my stay and the room was gorgeous. The amenities were amazing as well. Overall the hotel is absolutely beautiful both inside and out. The rooftop bar is beautiful as well and the food was very good.,5,2024,08,26
145,I highly recommend,"The Tralgar was very accommodating and spacious. The staff was extremely friendly and helpful, especially the door man, Toni. Be sure to visit the rooftop during your stay. - the views are marvelous. I highly recommend this hotel for your stay in London.",5,2024,08,26
145,Another great stay!,"This was our second time staying at the Trafalgar St. James and it was fantastic! Toni the doorman is great along with the rest of the helpful and friendly staff. The location is amazing, the rooms are spotless and beautifully appointed, and the breakfast buffet has everything! I highly recommend this hotel to anyone.",5,2024,08,26
145,Great location and outstanding staff!,"We stayed 4 nights at The Trafalgar St. James and it was perfect. While there was construction going on, it had no impact on our stay. The location couldn't have been better and the staff was outstanding. Sajjad helped point us in the right direction numerous times and was extremely helpful. We will be going back to London and will stay at The Trafalgar St. James without a doubt.",5,2024,08,25
145,Amazing location and staff.,"Was on a girls long weekend to see Taylor Swift and other activities.

The rooms were spacious and decorated lovely.  The staff were helpful and polite, making sure we were accommodated without being intrusive. 

My room was to the rear, were there is remedial works going on to Admiral Arch, however the room was quiet and bright. 

The doorman Toni was attentive, making sure we had what we needed, and had a good sense of humour.  Four woman travelling together, he checked in when we came in separately (after some shopping), that we were all ok, there was no issues.

There was several other guests staying for the concert and all the staff where having a banter with the Swifties.

The roof top restaurant was amazing as were the views.  The breakfast provided has lots of choices and didn't disappoint.

Highly recommend.",5,2024,08,25
145,Summer trip to London,"I traveled with my wife to London for a vacation. It was a great experience. The location of this hotel was what interested us the most. Initially we were taken back by the construction work in and around the hotel, but the check in staff (especially Lydia) were very helpful in finding us a room the next day that has less exposure to the construction noise and view.

The breakfast at the rooftop restaurant was amazing. Just the right variety of continental and hot items. The staff was great as well, especially Rob, he was very friendly and from day one he remembered what we like and made sure to bring it for us every morning.

Also, Toni the bell man, was super friendly, always greeted us with a smile whenever we leave the hotel and when we come back. And asked if he can help us with anything.

Overall, we had a great stay.",5,2024,08,24
145,Friendly staff and amazing location!,We absolutely loved our stay here! It was a last minute booking and plenty of options to choose from. I’m so glad we chose to stay! We were greeted by Toni and he immediately made everything a breeze! Super friendly and welcoming staff. The location is perfect for hitting all the best spots around London!,5,2024,08,23
145,Wonderful staff and wonderful stay,"We had transferred to this hotel after staying closing to Wembley for the Taylor Swift concert and it was an exceptional choice. The location is ideal for easy sight seeing and the staff was exceptional. From the moment we arrived, Toni greeted us and took care of anything we needed. Even though our room was not ready at arrival our luggage was housed and then delivered to our room when it was ready. Each time we left or arrived at the hotel Toni ensured we had everything we needed to make our stay more pleasant.",5,2024,08,22
145,10/10 recommend,"First, let’s talk location. I always like to stay near a landmark so I can find my way back easily and the Trafalgar St. James is right on Trafalgar Square. I never got lost! It’s also very convenient for subways, which make it so fast and easy to get around London. The hotel is a quick walk to Big Ben and the London Eye (both visible from the amazing rooftop bar), SoHo, Covent Garden, Piccadilly Circus, and the theater district.

Second, let’s talk rooms. The bed was so incredibly comfortable and the blackout curtains worked so well I slept until noon! There was plenty of space and amenities to make it feel comfortable and homey. I do usually prefer a shower with a door because the floor got wet easily but everything dried up quickly. The lighting by the makeup counter was also great. And the cool air made it very comfortable to sleep!

Third, the staff is incredibly helpful and always available. They texted me every day to make sure everything was to my liking. They allowed me to hang out early on the rooftop before they opened while I waited for my room to be ready. The doorman Toni was so helpful with baggage, recommendations, and a friendly face when entering or exiting the hotel. The friendly staff made me feel like I had so many friends!

10/10 recommend the Trafalgar St. James. It was a perfect stay and I can’t wait to return.",5,2024,08,22
145,Incredible Staff,"We had the most amazing stay at the Trafalgar St James. The staff really went above and beyond to make our stay five stars. We were there to celebrate our anniversary and Lidia made sure to celebrate us.  The concierge helped book travel from and to the airport as well as helped us navigate the tube our first day. Toni was also very helpful. Truly the staff was exceptional.

We were there for five nights. The location is ideal for exploring London, just a block or two from multiple tube stations and walkable to a ton of great restaurants. Our room was very well appointed and had good storage for central London. The room (we had a suite) was spacious for the city and we were grateful for the well stocked waters and espresso daily. 

There was construction happening in the lobby while we were there, it mostly wasn’t bothersome. However one morning it extremely loud right next to our room, we let the staff know it was an issue for us and they quickly discussed with the construction team and made sure the noise reduced dramatically. They went out of their way to make it right and we couldn’t be more grateful. 

We would 100% stay here again.",5,2024,08,21
145,Easy access to all of London’s tourist sites!,"Service, location, room amenities, and cleanliness- couldn’t ask for much more! The rooftop breakfast area and balcony were fantastic. I would definitely stay here again. The access to Charing Cross station and Embankment station made everything very convenient. Plus the service was top notch from the front desk, to the concierge, and the restaurant staff. Excellent base for exploring London.",5,2024,08,21
145,So comfortable and spacious! ,"I'm a word, Wonderful! I've stayed in many hotels, many in London and the rooms here are possibly most comfortable and spacious. Have everything you need as well as free water and soft drinks which are appreciated after a day walking in London.Super clean and well presented, believe me I'm fussy! The Smell I'm the rooms from the Molton Brown air freshener pots is heaven. Love it. Every staff member was professional but very friendly and welcoming. Breakfast on the roof was lovely, great service. I will be back ",5,2024,08,19
145,Excellent location!,"The Trafalgar St. James was a wonderful experience. We are long-time Marriott members and rarely stay at properties that are not Marriott. This hotel was an excellent location, the roof top restaurant is fabulous, and the breakfast is amazing. It was a perfect location for all of the sightseeing we wanted to do. A very special shout out to Toni- who greeted us initially and everyday thereafter. He was a welcome smile, very charming, and made our visit special!",5,2024,08,16
145,August visit to London,"We recently visited London and stayed at this hotel for 6 nights.  Our experience was - a nice room, great location (easy walking to several historical sites as well as restaurants & shops in Covent Garden, Piccadilly, & Carnaby), and absolutely outstanding service by whole the team!   A special shoutout to Sajjad for his good customer service with a happy smile.  Our package included daily breakfast at the rooftop restaurant and we thought it was a good value.  The only negative is all of the construction going on in the area, can which create lots of ‘under construction areas’ - for example the lobby area.   However, in total we found it to be a 5 star experience.",5,2024,08,14
145,A fantastic visit.,"We decided on the Hotel as our friends who were travelling from Japan had already booked their room. Out of nothing other than sheer convenience we too booked our stay here. In a twist of fate we ended up staying in adjacent rooms which our friends have insisted that they had no part in and nor did we. From check-in to check-out the team at the hotel could not have done enough for us, the lady on check in when faced with an issue with creating keys ensured we could access our room and as soon as she was able she brought the keys to the room for us. The food and service was excellent at breakfast and dinner and even the turndown service was excellent. Regardless of the ongoing renovations the hotel was quiet, spacious and comfortable. The views from the rooftop bar were spectacular too. A special mention needs to be made for Sajjad at the hotel door. He was an absolute gentleman and a credit to the hotel.",5,2024,08,13
145,Fabulous stay in central location,"Excellent service, staff very friendly and helpful. Location perfect. Beautiful suite, had everything we needed and more. Love the rooftop bar, breakfasts up there were amazing, huge choice of buffet and made to order. Beautiful meal of small plates there too.",5,2024,08,12
145,Iconic views of Trafalgar Square,Beautiful little hotel right on the square.  Walking distance to theatres and Piccadilly. Rooms are nice and have great views. It’s a bit noisy as you are right in the heart of the action. Earplugs recommended if you want to sleep in. Rooftop bar has great food and amazing views of the square. Staff is incredibly friendly and helpful. Elevators are a bit slow and the hotel uses a little too much fragrance in the lobby and rooms. Perfect home base for exploring the city!,4,2024,08,11
145,The Trafalgar St James Hilton Hotel,"I stayed here as I had to collect my passport from the Embassy of the Republic of Kazakhstan at 09:00 the next morning. It is less than 5 minutes away. Of course, everything was perfect: bed, shower, and breakfast, but really the price was unreasonable.",5,2024,08,10
145,The Trafalgar comes through again!,"I trusted the hotel this time in choosing a room for me. Again, they came through for us with the perfect room for this trip. This is my third time staying with them and the third time they've hit it out of the park! Each was interesting and all three different. The first time it was the king room on floor one (the second floor of the hotel) facing the embassy. The second was a cozy quiet room in the back that was massive in size but warm in ambience. The perfect mix for a late winter get away. The hotel is undergoing some reno and it's loud but supposedly over at the end of August 2024. But as a tourist your'e out most of the day, so it works out. What it did afford was breakfast in the rooftop restaurant with views! We will always return to this hotel.",5,2024,08,09
145,Perfect choice for central London,"I spent some weeks agonizing over where to stay in London because there is so much choice.  The same cannot be said for the number of 5 star properties that are reasonably priced centrally located and did I mention reasonably priced.  We had a Trafalgar suite which was spacious enough by London standards and very comfortable for my family of 3 for 5 days.  Comfy bed, nice room amenities.  Overall very happy we went with this hotel.  Smack dab in the middle of many central London sites, shopping, dining, theatre…..we walked virtually everywhere we wanted to go but it’s also very close to Charing Cross Station and several good bus routes if you want to go that option.  Close enough but also far enough away from the crowds and noise that we had no intrusion from outside noise in our room. Breakfast service could be a bit harried during peak times but other than that we found the service to be attentive, but not cloying.  I’m sure I’ll be back. Highly recommended!",5,2024,08,07
145,A haven in a hectic spot!,The hotel is in a tourist-heavy area but is a quiet spot in the midst of noise and crowds. The rooms are a nice size and the rooms are clean and comfortable.  The rooftop bar is a great spot to visit for a quick bite/drink and take in the view. This was a nice place to spend a few days to end our two week vacation in England.,5,2024,08,05
145,Luxurious and comfortable,"Nicest hotel I’ve been to so far! We had a family room so there was a big tub in the bathroom and a sofa near the bed. Very comfortable room and very luxurious. 
 The complimentary breakfast had the usual buffet fare like scrambled eggs, pancakes, hash browns, English breakfast items like beans, mushrooms. Also yogurt, fresh fruit, and some charcuterie. But also had options to order omelets and eggs Benedict. Coffee included cappuccinos and espressos. Everything was delicious!
 The rooftop bar was beautiful and had amazing views.
The staff was so friendly and helpful. The doorman Sajjad was very kind and gracious.",5,2024,08,04
145,"Great location, great hotel, little room for improvement","If you're here to see the sights, you'd be hard pressed to find a better location.

We had a very nice room with plenty of space, and even decent hanging/storage space, but of course it comes at a price - this is not a budget hotel by any measure.

Service overall is excellent, and you couldn't ask for friendlier or more helpful front desk, concierge, and door staff. They really make you feel at home.

For some incomprehensible reason we had to request washcloths every time we wanted them refreshed - they're apparently not among of the standard bathroom compliment. Otherwise housekeeping was superb.

Our room had a tub and separate glass-enclosed shower stall, which we found to be cramped (the shower itself, not the bathroom). If you wanted the big tub for a long soak it would probably be worth the tradeoff, but we'd rather have had a roomier shower. That said, the photos of the bathroom were accurate when I booked, so some of that's on me.

Sadly, The Rockwell was closed for renovation during our stay, but noise was never an issue. The Rooftop is a delightful place for breakfast or a drink and a snack, but doesn't have an extensive dinner menu. Still, there's no shortage of good restaurants in the area.",5,2024,08,04
145,Fantastic - We will be back!,"We thoroughly enjoyed our stay at the Trafalgar St. James! Our family of four shared a room with two queen beds for four nights and had plenty of space for storage as well as to stretch out and relax. Our room facing Trafalgar Square was perfect and the location was amazing for all that we wanted to do in London. The rooftop bar had fantastic views of Trafalgar Square, the London Eye, the Shard, Big Ben and more. A very convenient setting to the Charing Cross and Embankment underground stations for easy tube access. Beyond the hotel itself, the staff were absolutely amazing. Everyone from the front desk to the lobby and rooftop restaurant were extremely friendly and helpful. They even arranged for transportation back to Heathrow on our final day and held our luggage to allow us a few more hours of time about before our flight home. I highly recommend staying here and we will certainly be back on future trips to London!",5,2024,07,29
145,Lovely hotel,"A lovely hotel in the perfect location for all things London. We were able to walk almost everywhere and enjoyed the excitement of the city at Trafalgar Square.  The construction is a lot but was never noisy. The breakfast is wonderful and a great way to start the day.  

Sajjad the bellman was so very friendly and helpful. He assisted us with our bags and finding our Uber driver. What a wonderful ambassador for the city!",5,2024,07,25
145,Great service and wonderful rooms!,"Wonderful rooms, super friendly and helpful staff (Toni was great!), and a fabulous breakfast on the rooftop! The hotel is undergoing renovations, and it was not intrusive at all. I am so pleased that we chose this hotel. It really is in the best location! We were even able to see the King and Queen last week in a Royal procession from Buckingham palace- literally right around the corner from the hotel.",5,2024,07,24
145,Fantastic Hotel with great rooftop overlooking Trafalgar Square,Fantastic hotel. Rooms were nice with comfortable beds. Hotel breakfast on the roof is 5 star with made to order omelets. Great location and staff was super. Concierge was able to get us tickets to sold out theater show and really made the family happy. Really enjoyed the stay. Thank you! RC,5,2024,07,23
145,The Honeymoon Night To Remember Forever!,"I cannot say enough good things about the Trafalgar St. James in London, or its staff! My husband and I stayed there a few years ago and just loved the hotel and their staff. My son and his wife were on their honeymoon headed to Venice last week, and were stuck at London airport with a cancelled flight for 24 hours. I immediately booked a room at the St James and called them and told them the story. They were so very accommodating and even upgraded them to a beautiful suite! When my daughter in law walked in and saw the room and the rose petals on their bed she cried.  I cannot Thank the hotel and staff enough for turning a sour experience into a beautiful and most memorable one! Thank-You Everyone at The Trafalgar St. James! You will always be the place we stay when we visit London!",5,2024,07,23
145,Not Recommended,"My wife, my 11-year-old grandson and I stayed here for 7 nights in mid-June.  We picked it since they would guarantee adjoining rooms which went fine at check-in.  It’s also well situated near many attractions.  However, the hotel has several serious deficiencies.  For one, it’s very noisy.  There is major construction adjacent to the hotel that starts around 7 am.  Second, there are many garbage bins right behind the hotel and we could hear bottles being dumped into these bins well into the night.  The biggest problem, however, is that one of our rooms had a terrible sewer smell from the shower drain which they were never able to rectify and since we had adjoining rooms, they were not able to move us to similar adjoining rooms elsewhere.  The smell was so bad that the entire room smelled.  This started on the 3rd night and continued for the remaining 4 nights.  It got so bad that we had them unlock the windows so we could get some fresh air.  The worst part is that this is a problem they have known about for two years and never rectified.  I know this because there is a TripAdvisor review from 2022 that described the exact same problem in a room on the second floor, next to the elevator which is handicapped accessible (Room 210).  There are other reviews from 2022 which don’t identify the room but also describe terrible smells.  My recommendation is not to take the risk that you will have this problem and stay elsewhere.",1,2024,07,22
145,Adrian saves the day!,"We chose to stay at The Trafalgar St. James for our first visit to London. We couldn't have been happier. The location was perfect to see all the sites that we wanted to visit. The food was outstanding and the King Executive room was much larger than I expected. We celebrated our anniversary there and they had several nice touches to make our stay enjoyable. I would like to highly recommend Adrian as your Concierge do-it-all. He planned out our entire stay with various reservations to Buckingham Palace, the Churchill War Musem, Tower of London to just name a few places. His restaurant recommendations were top notch. I didn't have the time to plan for this trip as it was very last minute, so thank you Adrian for saving the day for us! We will be back again!",5,2024,07,22
145,A must stay,"Some of the nicest staff. Warm welcome when we arrived late at night. Our room was on the smaller size but very nice. Bed was extremely comfortable and the floor and hotel was very quiet. Bathroom was wonderful as well. 
Rooftop restaurant was delicious. 
You honestly can’t beat this location either. Close to everything you want to see in London.",5,2024,07,22
145,Quiet comfort in the heart of the tourist zone,"Great boutique hotel right in the heart of the action. Clean, comfortable rooms with fantastic staff, notably all the doorman who provide directions, restaurant recommendations and any advice guests may need. Special shout out to Toni who went above and beyond for us and even got us an umbrella when we left ours in the room during an unexpected rain.",5,2024,07,18
145,Loved it,"Amazing service, friendly staff, room is spotless clean, outstandingly fast response to requests. Toni's greetings and smiles were making day brighter. Breakfast is a bit on expensive side. Liked it overall. Rooftop is awesome for sunset cocktails.",5,2024,07,18
145,Perfect luxurious stay close to everything!,"Wonderful hotel - extremely kind and helpful staff, especially Toni! Thank you all for everything! we stayed in a plush, beautifully designed and comfortable family room with a pullout couch for our son. Luxurious bath products by Molton Brown, and a spectacular rooftop restaurant to enjoy breakfast or dinner! Highly recommend this excellent hotel!",5,2024,07,15
145,3 night stay- overall very good!,"First impressions:  As soon as we arrived, we were greeted by the doorman, Toni.  He was so professional, while also being warm and inviting.  Great first impression.  Location was also excellent.

Lobby: the lobby was nice, even though the hotel was definitely under construction.  

Rooftop: the rooftop was beautiful, comfortable, and chic.  Food and drinks were great. They did have a nice kids menu for dinner AND provided guests with warm blankets on a cooler night!!!  Such a great touch!

Main issue: Unfortunately, our room was not available at the listed Check in time (3 pm). In fact, it was not available for an entire hour after that.  We were told 20 min, that our room door was broken, etc. when really we found out that the guests before us took a very late check out.  Note- We had already dropped our luggage off around noon, so the hotel team knew we were in town and ready for our room as soon as it became available. This was very disappointing and inconvenient.",4,2024,07,15
145,DONOT STAY HERE EVEN FOR $10 A NIGHT UNTIL CONSTRUCTION IS 100% COMPLETE,"DONOT STAY HERE EVEN FOR $10 A NIGHT UNTIL CONSTRUCTION IS 100% COMPLETE There was horrible Construciton at the property, but it wasn't just regular construction. There were men with chipping hammers from 9am until 4pm. It was impossible to be anywhere in the building because of the vibration. I was on vacation and I couldn't take a nap. I also had to make business calls for a couple hours and had to go to park to do that. The noise and vibration was nerve racking and gave you an instant headache totally unfair . This hotel should not be open under these conditions. !!! Management was unresponsive and uncaring. It shows their business ethic they should have disclosed the chipping hammer and d",1,2024,07,14
145,Great stay in London,"Great location and good sized room for family.   The staff went above to make sure all needs were met.  Front desk was very helpful, and Toni at the front door could not have been nicer… high energy, welcoming and quick with a suggestion for lunch, or anticipating what we may need as we arrived and departed.",5,2024,07,13
145,Great location and great service,Great location and great service. The room was clean and comfortable. Every major sight seeing attraction is walking distance away from covent garden and SoHo to Westminster abbey and London eye. We especially appreciated Toni and his hospitality. Highly recommend!,5,2024,07,12
145,The Trafalgar St. James hit a grand slam with us!,"We recently visited the Trafalgar St. James in June when we travelled to London for the MLB Europe Series.  We had two rooms (Trafalgar Suite for me and my husband and a Nelson Double Queen room for our daughters - ages 25 and 22).  The rooms were beautiful and spacious.  The beds were very comfortable, and the amenities were top notch.  We loved the breakfast at the Rooftop and also enjoyed dinner there one evening.  Fabulous drinks, excellent food, and first rate service.  Thank you for a magnificent stay!",5,2024,07,10
145,Wonderful!,We had a Great experience. The lovely staff was there to help in every way and the hotel was in a perfect location.  We all very much enjoyed it and Highly recommend this hotel for your future holidays. Particular thanks to Toni who was extra wonderful and greeted us with a huge smile daily.,5,2024,07,10
145,"Great stay, highly recommend","Highly recommend staying at the Trafalgar St. James hotel. The hotel staff are so kind and professional, and I’d like to especially thank Toni and Kurtis for always being readily available to help me with anything that I needed and going above and beyond to make my stay comfortable and easy.   Both are huge assets to the hotel. Thank you both",5,2024,07,09
145,I recommend this place,"We had a great time. The room is spacious and the rooftop is great. The staff is excellent, Toni was helpful when I was checking out. The hotel location is also great. The breakfast spread and the staff nboth see great. It is walking distance to picadilly, Covent garden, soho, Oxford street and charting cross tube underground station. Go for it",5,2024,07,08
145,Disappointing and Avoid Until Construction is Complete,"I’ve stayed here before and it was lovely and convenient to so much we wanted to see. For the current value and cost, I would avoid until their construction is 100% complete. Dining downstairs is closed. Construction noise is very loud, not a minor inconvenience. You will not be able to enjoy a quiet afternoon respite in your room. The rooftop is the only onsite dining and it was closed for an event on at least one day. The elevator construction  noise and smells were awful. You also need to monitor events happening at Trafalgar Square as road closures and additional noise is possible.  We had to leave much earlier than we wanted on our checkout day due to car services being limited by the road closure. I was discussing with the concierge best departure time and the 
 Construction noise (jackhammering) was so loud in the lobby we had to  hold the conversation outside.  For what you will be charged, I highly recommend looking at other options until this hotels construction is over. Tony at the valet is a gem and did his best to help. This is not currently Hilton Curio Collection quality. For the inconvenience, we were provided three drink coupons  due to the rooftop dining closure. This was held on a first floor suite. Very disappointed in Hilton for not better advising and being fully honest about the magnitude of construction happening and I expressed such at the front desk. They said they would share my concerns but no response. To their credit they did pre-advise about Pride event road closure after we booked, but who is going to move all their belongings to another hotel for one night. Skip this hotel for now and maybe in the fall or whenever construction is complete it will better.",2,2024,07,07
145,Clean and centrally located,"This hotel was very clean and loved that it was centrally located, right next to  Charing crossing and right next to the Royal gardens. The rooftop was nice but unfortunately closed after 4 pm for a private event. The staff was extremely friendly and helpful, Toni the door man was exceptionally polite!",4,2024,07,06
145,Fantastic Hotel and Staff,"We stayed 6/16-6/23. Hotel was terrific, centrally based for our activities and the staff was fantastic. My wife uses a mobility scooter and the staff could not have been more accommodating. I would like to give a shout out to Tony, the doorman - he was great at getting us cabs and suggested we go to the Borough Market. This was one of the best markets I have ever been to and the diversity and quality of the food was amazing. I would also like to applaud the maintenance department guy (I am very sorry I didn’t catch his name) who went the extra mile and fixed my wife’s mobility scooter seat. All in all, one of the best experiences staying in a hotel. Highly recommended and I would be happy to stay there again if the opportunity presented itself.",5,2024,07,04
145,Toni the doorman amazing,Toni the doorman was amazing and so friendly. We had a wonderful time bc of him. The hotel is being renovated.  So lobby was small.  It was still great will be even better once it is completed.. The rooftop is a highlight. We had a great time here and loved Toni!,5,2024,07,04
145,Wonderful first London experience!! Highly recommend St. James,"We couldn’t recommend a better place to stay while in London! As soon as you walk into the hotel you are greeted by the friendliest, most helpful bellhops and receptionists. The view from the rooftop is one you don’t want to miss! The rooms were extremely clean and the bed was one of the most comfy hotels beds I’ve ever slept in- I would actually prefer it over my bed at home. 

When it was time to check out the bellhops came up to our room to bring down our bags.. the service simply did not miss! 

Toni was the biggest help when it came to calling a cab to get to our next location!

We can’t thank you all enough for making our stay so special! We will be back <3",5,2024,07,03

145,"Fantastic friendly service, perfect location in heart of London","I consider myself a regular here. Just love the location and the friendly staff. Toni at the front door is always there with a smile and efficient service.

There is a big renovation going on right now, so some noise during the working hours, and breakfast is temporarily in the rooftop bar, which is nice but overall a step down from the ground floor restaurant.",5,2024,07,02
145,"Great hotel, amazing crew","I just had a 6 nights stay in the Trafalgar. 
Everything about this stay was perfect.
Location is superb. Close to everything, most of my attractions were a walking distance from the hotel. 
The room was great. I got daily complimentary water, coke, biscuits, coffee, tea and chocolates.
But the best thing was the crew - everyone were always so nice and did everything they could to help me.
The doorman Toni was always very kind and warm, and usually solved my issues before I even went through the door.
I will definitely come back - from now on that's the only place I'm gonna stay in London.",5,2024,07,02
145,Excellent Hotel and Supreme Staff.,"The Staff at the St.James is excellent!

145,Wonderful experience.,"Had a great and memorable experience in London and especially staying at the Trafalgar St James Hotel.  We stayed for 4 days, 3 nights. Rooftop bar/ restaurant has a wonderful view that overlooks Trafalgar / city. Great food, drinks, and breakfast. 
Staff is very welcoming, prompt and efficient.  Front door concierge gentleman names Tony was awesome and very hospital.  This is the place to stay if you’re in the Trafalgar area.",5,2024,06,26

145,"Very comfortable room, great location","I had a room on a higher floor but with a very limited view and asked to be moved. The front desk found a much better room lower with a great view.

Nicely appointed room. The bedroom had great sound proofing so I heard nothing from trafalgar sq even though I'm a very light sleeper. The bathroom didn't have the same glazing so you could really tell the difference. The bed was super comfy, as were the pillows and the black out curtains were very high quality.
Wonderful bathroom soaps. Love the roof top bar and great buffet breakfast.",5,2024,06,22
145,Pleasant stay,"It was really nice staying here. Rooms were super clean, location is perfect. Special greetings to Mr. Toni. Mr. Toni was incredibly nice and helpful.

 Very close to metro within a few minutes walk to st. James park which is great",5,2024,06,21
145,"Lovely hotel, Great location","This is a lovely hotel in an excellent location.  We were there to attend the Trooping of the Colours and King’s Birthday.  It was close walking distance.  We also went to the Majesty Theatre, also walking distance.  The shopping, eating and sights were all close by.  It was also close to the tube, Rail, and buses.

Hotel’s breakfast on the Rooftop was lovely.

It’s currently under renovation but all the amenities were there.",5,2024,06,19
145,Awesome hotel in central London,"We absolutely loved our stay at the Trafalgar St. James. The location is great with many walkable attractions and restaurants plus a tube station nearby. The staff is very accommodating and helpful regarding information about London. They are happy to call you a cab at anytime as well. You must enjoy breakfast on the rooftop during your stay, the food is great and fairly priced plus you get to enjoy the nice view. It was rainy the day we ate breakfast there but they have a covered portion. The rooms are beautiful and very spacious for London. 

When we checked in, our room AC was not working and the room was extremely hot. After waiting a few hours for the room to cool off, it was still not working properly. The front desk immediately moved us to a new room and even gave us complimentary chocolates with a hand written note. We really appreciated their ability to quickly solve this issue. 

I’d highly recommend staying here and would be happy to stay here again.",5,2024,06,18
145,Great personalised experience,"We had a wonderful and personalised experience at the Trafalgar. The facilities were very good and the staff were excellent.

The hotel is in the perfect location to visit all things in London! The Rooftop view is amazing and the food delicious! We travelled with my 88 year old mother and were the 1st to use the new lift in the lobby which made it super easy to get in and out of the hotel. If you’re heading to London, this is the perfect place to stay!!!",5,2024,06,16
145,Lovely well located hotel with excellent service,"The room was well appointed, quiet and very comfortable. The location of the hotel is excellent. The service was wonderful. All around a great stay from the warm welcome upon arrival to the efficient checkout. I will be back.

145,Best hotel in London,"This hotel never disappoints 
Excellent in every department 
The rooms are immaculate ,and beautifully appointed
Excellent location and spectacular views from the rooftop bar
Don’t be put off by the re-modelling which is due for completion this Summer 
This is my favourite hotel in London",5,2024,06,12
145,Fabulously located lovely hotel.,"A fabulous location- directly across from Trafalgar Square and the National Gallery. Friendly welcome from the reception staff, who kindly allowed me an early check in after I had had a very early start to my day due to rail strikes. Wonderfully comfortable room and spotlessly clean. My included breakfast was delicious and always appreciative of free fizz at breakfast when on leisure trips. I also enjoyed a pre dinner cocktail on the roof terrace which was lovely.",5,2024,06,09
145,Excellent hotel at an iconic location,I stayed two nights earlier this month while in London for business meetings. I called ahead as I was looking for early checkin after a night flight. I understood that this was not guaranteed but on arrival (11:00am) my upgraded room was ready which was most welcome. The king room allocated was beautifully appointed and all the amenities worked - not always the case in my experience at some hotels.  The staff were attentive and helpful and the rooftop breakfast which enjoys views of Nelson’s Column was comprehensive and delicious. Definitely worth considering this hotel for a business or leisure trip to London as Charring Cross tube station is across the road at Trafalgar Square.,5,2024,06,06
145,"First Class Hotel, First Class Staff",Fantastic experience! This Hilton property pulls out all the stops to make you feel at home. The staff is absolutely friendly and anxious to help.  The breakfast buffet is a winner…something we looked forward to every morning.  You are right on Trafalgar Square…what a site.  Also the rooftop lounge has an amazing view of the city at night. Nice place for drinks after a day of touring London.  Although the hotel is undergoing remodeling I highly recommend it.,5,2024,06,06
145,Never fails to impress,"The Trafalgar St. James never fails to impress. From the warm welcome in the reception, to a great, very clean room, to a scrumptious breakfast with hot items on the menu as well as a well-equipped buffet (oh, and the breakfast staff is also very warm and welcoming), this is just a great hotel. And you can't beat the location.  The personal touch is what brings me back. This time I was traveling with my mom, and I mentioned that we were in London to celebrate her birthday. And on her birthday we got back to our room to find a box of chocolates and a personal birthday greeting! This was my mom's first stay at The Trafalgar St. James. She is a keen traveller and not easy to impress, but she absolutely loved this hotel (and the breakfast!) and can't wait to go back!",5,2024,06,05
145,1st time Londoners,The room was prefect for the 3 of us. It was centrally located for what we wanted to do in the amount of time we had. The rooftop bar has amazing views at night! Breakfast was definitely well worth it. Thank you so much for the pleasant stay. We will definitely stay here again on our next visit,5,2024,06,04
145,Super impressive hotel,"Excellent stay. Staff were all very friendly and helpful, the location could not be anymore central, and the rooms were of an incredibly high standard - in terms of design, facilities, and cleanliness. You could see Nelson’s column from our room and it was all super impressive. Yes, there are refurbishment works going on but it didn’t trouble our stay at all. Overall we had a brilliant stay and we look forward to returning soon!",5,2024,05,26
145,Post cruise and quick London visit,"Service, rooms, location all excellent. The concierge, Mike, was amazing. Arranging private drivers for tours to recommendations for dinner was on point. He helped to make our short time in London spectacular. Fresh flowers in the room. Molton Brown soaps. Central location. Perfect first visit to London!",5,2024,05,25
145,Weekend break,"Fantastic weekend in London with my sister. Staff at Trafalgar St James were super friendly and helpful. Nothing was too much trouble. They put chocolates in the room for my sister's birthday which was a lovely touch. 
The room was spacious, clean and comfortable with a great view of Trafalgar Square. Amazingly quiet considering our location.
Although there is construction going on it did not interfere with our enjoyment. The Rooftop terrace and Bar was perfect for evening drinks and nibbles and also for breakfast.
All in all a fabulous stay. The staff made it extra special. All of them friendly and helpful. This includes bar staff, waiters and of course front of house. Thank you.",5,2024,05,21
145,Avoid until construction is complete.,"Due to construction there was only one working elevator and access to the stairs was padlocked close in violation of fire code. In the event of the fire egress would have been via elevator only. 

Avoid until construction is complete within the hotel.

Poor lighting in the hallways and rooms would not be helpful for those with poor or limited eyesight and mobility.",3,2024,05,19
145,Everything under construction,"We reserved many months in advance, but when the time for our trip came, so much was under construction at the hotel, we regretted coming. The hotel is in a very convenient location, for sure, but there was construction in the lobby, so there was very loud drilling that could be felt in our first floor room and most annoying of all, no on-site restaurant during our stay. There was construction behind the hotel, too, and then, of course, the weekend of our trip, there was a gas main break that closed the road in front of the hotel, making it really difficult for taxis/rideshares to get to us or drop off. It wouldn't have been so bad if I wasn't traveling with my dad, who has mobility issues. The elevators were also spotty at best - sometimes one of two was out of service, and we and other guests kept getting brought to the wrong floors. We laughed about it, but it was frustrating. There was also NO elevator access to the roof bar while we were there. That elevator was broken too. Very unfair to disabled guests. The room itself was nice - we had a family king suite and it was roomy, especially the bathroom. Great shower!

The rooftop bar was lovely at night - heated, too! I had a solo drink and the staff was attentive.

I don't think the price was fair for the amount of inconvenience with the construction noise and disruption. The common areas and elevators definitely need a refresh. However, the staff was always very friendly and helpful and of course none of the construction hassle was their fault. I just can't say I would want to risk staying here again.",3,2024,05,19
145,Fabulous hotel for 1st trip to London,Fabulous hotel for 1st trip to London! Beautiful hotel and centrally located. Loved the roof top bar and restaurant for lunch and breakfast. Delicious food but could use a few more menu options. We also ordered room service.  The only downside would be that the room had a strong perfume smell. Great staff!,5,2024,05,16
145,The best staff,"The location and amenities of this stay were phenomenal but what really made the stay 10/10 was Toni. He was always there to greet us with a smile
on his face and jumped into action to book taxis to make sure our stay was as easy and enjoyable as possible",5,2024,05,14
145,Very good service,We had a most enjoyable stay in the The Trafalgar St. James Hotel much and wanted to mention the wonderful  service and attention provided by doorman Toni.  We will definitely book a stay in this hotel again when coming to London next time. Thank you!,5,2024,05,12
145,We had a most enjoyable vacation in London and stay at The Trafalgar St. James,"My family & I has a most enjoyable stay at The Trafalgar St. James Hotel. The full staff was very welcoming and professional throughout the hotel and our stay. The food and services provided were excellent in our opinion. If we book another trip to London, we will be sure to select this hotel for our full stay. Thank you.",5,2024,05,12
145,A perfect celebration!,"From the moment we arrived to the moment we left, the hotel and service was fantastic - the rooftop bar made a really special move of assigning one of the best tables for us to have cocktails with friends to celebrate my partner’s birthday. Cocktails are incredible by the way (the out out in particular!) and the nibbles too. They brought out a surprise brownie at the end to say happy birthday. The room (we were in a family room) was spacious and the beds are like clouds to sleep on. We have stayed in hundreds of hotels and this is now our no.1 in London. Views, comfort, location and staff who went out of their way to genuinely make sure we had a great time. We missed breakfast as it was a late night but I’ll be sure to come back and try that. 
PS if you are ordering room service, get the burger, absolutely lush and surprisingly quick. 

Thank you Trafalgar St James for making this 24 hours to remember. We will be back! Thanks to Keshav and crew for great front of house welcoming too.",5,2024,05,11
145,Great stay,"We had a wonderful stay here. The staff went above and beyond to make us comfortable. The location is within walking/short tube right to top sights. We would definitely stay here again. 
Special shout out to Lidia at the front desk and the bellman from Venezuela, we didn’t catch his name, but he was so pleasant!",5,2024,05,09
145,Perfect Stay,"Fantastic hotel with an outstanding team.  When we checked in we were greeted by Jackson and Sofia who were so welcoming and friendly.  Sofia very kindly arranged for our luggage to be stored and taken to our room when the room was ready so that we could go for walk and enjoy the afternoon.  The hotel is perfectly located for all the major attractions and theatres.  Rooms are immaculate and there is absolutely everything you could wish for provided.  Breakfast was in the Rooftop restaurant as Rockwell was closed, but it was a beautiful morning so delightful having breakfast in the sunshine.  Highly recommend this hotel and the amazing staff.  Will definitely be staying again when in London.",5,2024,05,07
145,Great service,"A very pleasant stay, as Hilton Honors Gold Member my room was upgraded. The staff was very polite and helpful both at Front Desk and at Rooftop Bar. Nice views from rooftop. Great location.",5,2024,05,06

145,Amazing weekend in London,"Loved this hotel! Lidia kindly upgraded us as the trip was for my birthday. The staff, room and rooftop views were just incredible. The location was perfect for our theatre trip and the other things on our itinerary (Buckingham Palace, Big Ben, China Town, Picadilly Circus are all nearby). Would definitely stay again!",5,2024,05,05
145,Great location and service ,"Amazing hotel. Superb location for West end and hotel rooms spacious and clean. Shout out to Kurtis and team for amazing service and looking after us so well. Kurtis kindly upgraded us as we were celebrating our anniversary - thank you!

Great rooftop bar with incredible views.

Highly recommend ",5,2024,05,05
145,"Great location, great Hotel Collection benefits.","Wonderful hotel, can't beat the location. My daughter and I came for a long weekend and really enjoyed this hotel. We stayed using the AMEX Hotel Collection programme, and received free breakfast every morning, and an £80 credit for the hotel, which made our stay quite affordable. While there was some construction in the hotel and in the area, it didn't bother us much as we were walking around London all day. Highly recommend, especially using the AMEX Hotel Collection.",5,2024,05,04
145,Excellent hotel in fantastic location with genuine hospitality and outstanding staff,"Outstanding hotel, rooms are incredible and the location excellent. The staff were attentive and friendly without being overbearing.

145,THE BEST HOTEL,"Stayed here for 5 days to celebrate my 40th birthday! I could not have picked a better Hotel! The entire staff were so welcoming, attentive & helpful, they made our stay that much better! The hotel is amazingly beautiful, comfortable, clean & inviting. Toni helped us throughout our stay, opening the door, greeting us, helping us get cabs & helping with the luggage. He is truly amazing & you can tell he loves his job! Everyone there was amazing.",5,2024,04,29
145,Great Experience and Trip,"This hotel was fantastic and central to everything I wanted to do. Toni at the front door was very helpful and kind on many occasions and we also share the same name haha. Breakfast was great, i thought it was included but later found out it was $20 for the buffet. Food was still great.  I would stay here again.",5,2024,04,29
145,Superb!,I greatly enjoyed my stay at this hotel and I will definitely return. The location was perfect; 15 minutes walk from the Buckingham Palace. Everything was top notch especially the customer service. They were all so eager to please. I especially loved the Doorman Toni! He was so nice and accomodating. He was willing and able to take care of all my needs. I'm already planning my next trip to London!,5,2024,04,29
145,Great Stay at The Trafalgar St. James,"Had an absolutely amazing trip to London and stay at the Trafalgar St. James. The staff was incredibly friendly and helpful, especially Toni!

145,Always a Warm Welcome at the Trafalgar St. James- Our Home Away from Home,"Our family had another amazing stay at the Trafalgar St. James last week. We visit London frequently from Paris and we always choose the Trafalgar St. James. The central location is ideal.Even though it is right near Trafalgar Square, the rooms are quiet, the beds are very comfortable and we sleep like babies. They have a cool roof-top bar and delicious breakfast too. But the real reason we return is that the people working there all go out of their way to make each stay a special one. Many thanks to all for their warm welcome and care. Special thanks to: Kurtiss Huggins, very professional and generously gave us an upgrade and a surprise in the room; Lidia, who arranged a surprise for my daughter's 17th birthday; doorman Toni, who looked after us each day and made sure we caught our Eurostar on time during the London Marathon (a previous time, he dragged our luggage through the streets to get a taxi), everyone I would see at the front desk, including Ingrida, Nelson Gomes ,Jackson, Keshav and other people I may be leaving out. We are always happy to speak with the fabulous concierge team: Tom and Michael always give us good advice and, along with the whole family of the Trafalgar St. James Hotel, make us feel like we are returning to our home away from home in London.",5,2024,04,29
145,Great location,"Nice hotel, breakfast is good, the location is excellent, a few feet away from the underground/ rail station, the staff are really helpful, Toni the doorman is always ready with useful tips. Would definitely stay here again. The only drawback for me were the pillows, not great but good enough.",5,2024,04,29
145,Great location and wonderful stay.,"Lovely place, great location. Especially if you run the London Marathon.
We enjoyed our stay and appreciate the special attention for marathon runners.",4,2024,04,28
145,Top notch experience,We chose this hotel for my partner’s first time in London for its amazing location. We also enjoyed the fantastic service at the hotel. The beautiful views from the top of the roof terrace were a bonus we didn’t expect. The room was comfortable and we loved the Molton Brown products in the bathroom. The doorman Toni was so friendly. We hope to be back.,5,2024,04,27
145,10 stars,"We loved every minute of our experience here. The breakfast on the rooftop was top notch every morning. I loved leaving our room to adventure and to come back to it all tidied up and clean with fresh and new everything. Truly a wonderful time. 

The doorman, Toni, greeted us and helped us each day. He was such a wonderful part of our experience. Great job Toni!

We will be back :-)",5,2024,04,27
145,Welcoming,Our one night stay was amazing! As a Hilton diamond loyalty member I had booked a queen room with a free night certificate to end our trip to London and was recognized at check-in. We were upgraded to a king size room with great views of Trafalgar Square. The hotel also welcomed us with a welcome gift of chocolate truffles and a personalized note. Breakfast was great on the rooftop and I would 100% stay here again on our next London trip!,5,2024,04,26
145,A smiling reception in central London,"Although the Hotel was in the process of building works the staff were friendly and welcoming. Our room was spacious, comfortable and well appointed, with a lovely welcome message from the manager. Powerful Shower and thick fluffy towels.
Wonderful rooftop bar with views across the Square and London beyond. Not the cheapest drink you'll ever have, but you'll never have a better view ! Do not forget your camera !!
Lovely self serve breakfast, helpful chatty staff and the overall feeling that your custom was truly valued.",5,2024,04,26
145,Amazing!,"This hotel is fantastic! My boyfriend and I visited London for the first time, and we stayed right in the heart of the city. The hotel is impeccably clean, and the surrounding area is also well-maintained. Most major attractions are just a 15-minute walk away, which made exploring super convenient. When we checked in, Jaxson greeted us with warmth and was always ready to assist. Toni, the doorman, was incredibly friendly and offered excellent suggestions for things to do in the city. Staying at this hotel really made our trip stress-free. Plus, the rooftop is stunning, and the drinks are incredible!",5,2024,04,26
145,"Wonderful stay at the Trafalgar St. James, April 2024","Wonderful experience at the Trafalgar St. James in London this week. We were warmly greeted by Toni during our coming and going each day and he was incredibly helpful getting us a cab upon checkout. Jackson was beyond helpful during check in and we appreciated the handwritten letter by Lydia awaiting us in our room... which was WONDERFUL. Huge windows, high ceilings, comfortable bed, and pleasant lighting. Thermostat was easy to use and resposive. Evening turn down service was great. The staff at the rooftop bar was quick, courteous, and polite while the breakfast was delicious. Was initially torn between this location and the Conrad a few blocks away while doing some pre booking research, but would return here in a heartbeat. So glad we had the opportunity to spend some time at such a great hotel during our trip to England. While ""under construction"" in the lobby, it is hardly noticeable.",5,2024,04,25
145,Incredible hotel for such a low price,Beautiful hotel. Perfect location and impeccably designed. Toni the doorman is a gem! He gave us great dining recommendations.,5,2024,04,25
145,Great location,"The locación is perfect, you can walk  to many turistic places and the is an underground just there. Rooms have good space and personal is very kind, specially Toni, always looking after helping guests",5,2024,04,22
145,Nice Place to Stay,"I enjoyed my stay, the hotel served my purposes well & provided value. As other reviewers have mentioned, the staff are wonderful. I was happy with my standard room, which was sizeable & well equipped. There is work going on around the hotel currently, but this didn’t really trouble me. I didn’t dine in-house, the restaurant ‘Rockwell’ was closed for renovations, but I did have drinks on the fab little rooftop terrace bar. The location, opposite Trafalgar Square, is handy for the major sights of the city.",5,2024,04,20
145,Outstanding London destination,"The staff were so welcoming, kind and helpful. Toni greeted us like an old friend each day. Everyone went out of their way to make our stay memorable. Perfect location for seeing London. Amazing views from rooftop bar. Breakfast was delicious too. Highly recommend.",5,2024,04,19
145,Feel a bit Royal at St James,"The St James was quite possibly the most accommodating hotel I've stayed at this year. Even in the midst of a remodel, hotel staff were courteous, attentive, and took every step necessary to make guests aware of what was going on in the building. Perhaps the highlight of the St James is Toni. He'll greet you at the door, make you feel royal, and genuinely ask about you, your day, your stay. If I ever need to stay in central London again, he's the reason I'll stay at St James!",5,2024,04,19
145,Family loved it!,"Room was comfortable, staff were wonderful especially Toni the doorman.  Rooftop bar was amazing and the location was perfect for visiting all off the major tourist attractions.  Even with remodeling taking place, only one lift was operational and one restaurant closed we would repeat.",5,2024,04,19
145,Amazing stay again,"Great stay again!! Perfect place to stay in.  London. Breakfast was fab, staff are amazing. Special mention for Toni the doorman who is always friendly and helpful!   Can’t  wait to come back again 
Flight on Trafalgar Square. Buses and tube 
Links just outside",5,2024,04,18
145,Great hotel in great area! Toni is the man!,My son and I took a trip to London to watch a football match. We picked the hotel because of the area it was in. The hotel was great. The staff was welcoming and helpful. Toni the doorman was awesome! He was so helpful with anything we needed. We would highly recommend this hotel.,5,2024,04,18
145,A great hotel and staff,"The hotel is very nice and the staff are very friendly and welcoming. 
Toni the doorman/concierge was keen to help out with local knowledge or transport to make your stay easier. 
We were aware of update works being carried out in the reception area but it did make the area less inviting for a high end hotel.
I’m sure it will be lovely when it’s finished.
The quality of the rooms are high end and have everything you need. 
We had breakfast in the restaurant on the top floor which had a good selection of hot and cold options and very tasty.
I would stay here again for all of the above reasons and its location to the sites of London.
We were on a theatre night out and its walking distance to the Adelphi and other shows in the area.",4,2024,04,15
145,A fantastic stay in the heart of London,"We had a great stay at The Trafalgar St James. Right in the heart of the city, the hotel was perfect for our 2 night stay in London.

The staff were all friendly and helpful, especially Toni at the door who gave us great recommendations including a local coffee shop.

Would definitely recommend to anyone looking to stay centrally in a beautiful hotel with spacious, clean and comfortable rooms.",5,2024,04,15
145,"Nice hotel, Wonderful Staff & Service","TripAdvisor 

We had a great experience at the Trafalgar Square St James.  We were traveling with a toddler and the staff were nice to greet us and very accommodating. The hotel itself was nice and in a central location but it was the staff & service that made our stay excellent. Toni and the staff were very welcoming upon our arrival. They went above and beyond with helping us out with our luggage. While we stayed here for 3 nights, we enjoyed the breakfast restaurant and rooftop for dinner. The food isn’t anything mind blowing but it’s good. More so, the service and staff were all great. We would definitely stay here again, the next time we’re in London. We thought it was good value for what we’re getting. Wonderful experience and would highly recommend staying here.",5,2024,04,14
145,Thank you Toni and Aytug,"İt was a perfect week for our family. We enjoy our stay at the hotel, the staff was really nice. Specially the guy at the door, Toni, he was so sweet and helpful. His smiling face waited at the hotel door first day we came, he was helping with bags, taxis, tryıng to answer all our questions about city…  he definitely made our stay more comfortable.
And the other guy Aytug, he was so helpfull at niight.
They make our stay evan better.
Thank you in the name of our family.",5,2024,04,13
145,Week in London,"We stayed at the Trafalgar hotel for 7 nights as a family of 4. We loved the hotel!!! It was the perfect location as it was close to everything and we could walk most places including Big Ben, Buckingham palace, Westminster Abby, London eye, soho, west end and covent garden very easily. Rooftop huge pro as when our kids were tired and wanted to relax, my husband and I could go up and enjoy. Wish we came when restaurant was not under construction as it looked very pretty when we saw that the door was open. Nice gym and great staff. Rooms were very comfortable but my biggest and only complaint was there wasn’t enough drawer space for the family suite. 
Would definitely recommend it and would return!!!",5,2024,04,12
145,"Nice hotel, great location, friendly helpful staff",Friendly staff from Tony on the door to the front desk staff. The refurbishment was going on through the day but didn’t bother us as we were out all day. Finished by 5 pm. Arrived a bit early and the front desk gave us a free room upgrade which was lovely. Spacious elegant room with views out over Trafalgar Square. Would stay again.,5,2024,04,11
145,Loved this place,"
All the staff at The Trafalgar St James Hilton were so friendly and helpful with everything. Tony greeted us at the door and made us feel right at home each time he held the door for us. Outstanding service and all very professional. Many languages were spoken by the staff and, of course, English. Loved staying in the Trafalgar square because it's so close to so many sights and restaurants as well as theaters. A+ rating for The Trafalgar St James Hilton.
",5,2024,04,10
145,"Fab, fab, fab","The hotel is currently undergoing a refurbishment but it had no impact on my stay which shows how hard they have tried to keep standards up. The room was lovely and quiet, service as ever was impeccable and having breakfast on the Rooftop overlooking Trafalgar Square a real treat in the morning light. Love the Cool BRitannia vibe of the hotel.",5,2024,04,10
145,My Favorite London Hotel,"The Trafalgar was as fabulous and beyond all my expectations!   The Trafalgar’s cleanliness was exceptional as was the daily & nightly hotel staff that refreshed and replenished our room.  Toni, the doorman, always gave us such a wonderful, warm, friendly welcome home every time we returned to the hotel.",5,2024,04,08
145,Perfect Stay for a first time London visit!,"The service was exceptional and the rooms were very clean. Housekeeping did an excellent job of tidying/cleaning the room each day as well. The location is phenomenal. We were in walking distance to so many tube stations along with Traflagar Square and Buckingham Palace, among others. Everyone who worked at the hotel was always so friendly. This was our first trip to London and enjoyed it thoroughly.
A slightly wider range food menu on the rooftop would have been nice since the main restaurant was under construction. The food we did have though was great!",5,2024,04,07
145,Amazing hotel!!!,"We really enjoyed our stay. Perfect location, beautiful room and excellent service. The staff was super helpful and nice to us. Toni in particular was very kind, giving us directions, helping out with our bags and overall making our experience much better.
Will definitely visit again if we ever come back to London!!!",5,2024,04,06
145,Excellent!,Superb. Great welcome from Adrian downstairs and Dawit at the Rooftop. Superb setting and great food and drink choices. Good helpings and well cooked. Highly recommended. Warm welcome and superb portions of food all cooked and prepared on the premises.,5,2024,04,05
145,Tarnished by shameful customer service,"Please be aware, on arrival we were asked for a £200 ""deposit"" for a £486 p/n room, when leaving the hotel I was asked by the duty manager to leave a good review on Trip advisor. To date we have not received the deposit back, we have spoken with the hotel and have been advised it takes 4.5 weeks to refund the deposit. We visited as 4 mature adults, to be asked for a deposit was unexpected to say the least, for it to take 4 weeks to refund is an insult. We enjoyed our stay including dining and the roof bar however, although a return visit was  discussed during our visit we will not be returning or recommending this hotel.",1,2024,04,04
145,Toni,"Toni, the doorman, deserves every star possible! His professionalism and attention to detail made every interaction a pleasure. Whether welcoming guests or offering assistance, Toni's presence added a touch of excellence to our experience. His friendly demeanor and helpful attitude truly set the tone for our visit. If you're looking for exceptional service, Toni is the epitome of hospitality. Five stars without a doubt!",5,2024,04,04
145,Best place to stay!,"Hands down the best location and beautiful hotel. Clean, beautiful, comfortable and quiet rooms. Great spot to see all of the London highlights. 
Breakfast on the rooftop was delicious and evening drinks on the rooftop were spectacular. 
A thank you to Adrian who went above and beyond to help us get to a premier league game. An amazing experience. 
Toni is wonderful. Always there with a warm greeting and ready to help!",5,2024,04,03
145,Pleasantly surprised,"The room was large and very clean.  
The roof top bar is a hidden gem and has a stunning view across London (definitely worth a visit).

The hotel location was central and convenient to all the attractions.   
Staff were friendly and welcoming . We were so impressed by the whole experience we are planning our next trip back.",5,2024,04,01
145,Stay somewhere else!,"Location was great however the rest not so great. Lobby small and very crowded. I’m a diamond member with Hilton but not treated like one. Bar/restaurant  on roof but the ambience just ok. Had candy when I arrived in my room however card was made out to some other name-not me. In the morning getting ready the electric blew 2 times. Apparently you can’t have the tv on, make coffee, and dry your hair all at once here. Had to call 2 times for someone to reset. Only one outlet in room worked to charge phone. Got on elevator and scanned key. The entire box fell off wall. Very disappointing for price paid. Won’t be back!!",2,2024,03,30
145,Definitely recommend,"Hotel staff were excellent, friendly and welcoming - we were able to check in 3 hours early. All areas of the hotel were clean. Room was spacious and comfortable. During our stay, Toni on the door was helpful and friendly - wonderful service!",5,2024,03,28
145,Great location with a homely feel feel.,"Perfect location, it was literally a 10 minute walk from everything we wanted to do. The rooms were clean and well decorated.  I did find the shower a little small for my taste but it had great water pressure.  The staff was super friendly and made sure that we felt welcome.  
The thing that put this place over the top was the roof top bar.  It’s only 7 floors up but the views are impeccable.  We sat out there every night and recapped our day.   
It is worth noting that the lobby was under construction during my stay but it did not take away from our experience.  I will stay here again.",5,2024,03,27
145,Best Location Best Service and Best View,"From the moment our luggage was taken from the Uber to my rebooking a night on our way out of the UK….. everyone smiled and was sweet and helpful. From the Hostess at breakfast (included fresh made hummus that was particularly delicious) to the concierge and the front desk and everyone else …. Service with a smile also included a well stocked fridges with abundant seltzer and water. 
Buckingham palace complete with changing of the guard just steps away. We walked to Harrods and two different shows.  We stood on the edge of the Thames and walked to everything without entering a vehicle for three days. 
I am now booking a return visit for the end of travels in the UK. This was the perfect place to start our two weeks of UK travel.",5,2024,03,26
145,A tranquil hotel in the center of London,"This hotel was excellent. While the location is central, the rooms were tranquil and quiet. I’m a light sleeper and typically don’t sleep well in hotels and I slept very well here. There was very little hallway or street noise. The staff are also excellent-friendly, helpful people who make for a pleasant stay. They prepared my room a little early and placed my luggage inside, they gave great restaurant recommendations, and they always hailed me a taxi with astonishing speed. While the sleep and the staff were the standouts compared to similar hotels, everything else was also excellent. The rooms were well appointed with all the necessary amenities, the breakfast was good, and the gym was good and had a Peloton bike. There was lobby renovation occurring at the time of my stay and it did not detract from the overall experience.",5,2024,03,24
145,"good location, rooms nice","rooms are nice, but dark, but the hotel is lacking a common space bc of construction.
central location is lovely - super easy to get bus + uber, and to walk to underground
the lovely (and beautiful) man who works the front desk made my stay super great!",4,2024,03,14
145,The perfect hotel..,"A delightful stay, the perfect location, & lovely staff. Kurtis ensured everything was just right, thank you for the chocolates. Adrian & Michael answered our myriad of questions and pointed us in the right direction for each mornings adventure. Toni and Juan manned the front door with a warm welcome and pleasant smile..",5,2024,03,14
145,Best doorman in London,"The hotel staff are superb - friendly professional yet not obsequious 
You will be met by the doorman .Toni, who couldn’t have done more for us. Smart
In his top hat, he was a key part of the hotels wonderful welcome. 
See you again Toni. We feel like we have gained a great friend.",5,2024,03,13
145,Our Favorite Hotel in London,"The offerings, staff, and proximity to major sites at this hotel are all top notch.  Great service with a personal touch. Wouldn’t stay anywhere else in London.

We arrived early on a transatlantic flight and the staff had our room ready within a couple of hours for early check-in. All of our interactions with staff were friendly and we felt well taken care of the entire stay.",5,2024,03,12
145,Central hotel with great rooms.,"Very helpful customer service, proactively offered me recommendations and a socket adapter. The breakfast is great, and their restaurant offers amazing views of the city as they‘re located on the top floor. The rooms themselves have a pretty generous size, the bathrooms were very clean.",5,2024,03,06
145,Lovely experience- rooftop breakfast is a must,"We stayed here for our first trip to the UK for our wedding anniversary. This hotel was a great location and convenient to many attractions. Staying in a central location is always helpful when visiting an unfamiliar city. The staff were very kind, especially at breakfast on the rooftop. The daily breakfast with views of Trafalgar Square and the National Gallery was a lovely way to start the day- honestly a highlight of the trip. Staff advised sunrise times and weather conditions for the best day and time of the day for stunning pictures. Housekeeping was also excellent with great attention to detail and always fully restocking the generous included amenities.",5,2024,03,05
145,Toni is great!,Very friendly and accommodating hotel staff. Housekeeping was prompt and professional. Toni especially made our trip special. He’s incredibly welcoming and caring. Always provided tips and suggestions in the area and helped us find taxis to the airport. We will definitely stay here again. Thank you Toni!,5,2024,03,04
145,"Staff is the heart of Trafalgar, St.James!","Fantastic team! Greeted upon  arrival with a smile and service is truly their motto. 
Toni, was friendly, helpful and every time I came in and out he asked how my day was and just added joy to my stay! 
Jackson, always friendly too and willing to help with directions! 
The rooftop staff were fabulous, the views gorgeous l! 

The guest rooms are very clean and chic decor, great size too! Yet the staff are the heart of the building!",5,2024,03,01
145,Great stay,Great stay at the Trafalgar. Room is spotless and extremely comfortable. Location is excellent with great restaurants and Whole Foods/Tesco around for quick supplies. Good service too with Toni being extremely helpful in flagging down a cab for me amidst the drizzle.,5,2024,02,29
145,Worst experience hotel ever!,"At the outset, my experience with Trafalgar Curio is the worst experience I had with any hotel. BTW, I am Diamond with Hilton, Titanium with Marriott, and Diamond with IHG.

Here is my case: I booked a hotel via the Hilton Diamond reservation center and said clearly that there would be two adults and one child for the stay. However, when I arrived, the front desk refused to check me in for the reason that the room I booked was only for two people. They asked me to pay extra money (like 100GBP which I didn't remember correctly) to upgrade to a suite, which I refused. I asked the people at the front desk to cancel the booking and they agreed. However, I later found that I was still CHARGED for the booking even though the front desk staff told me they had canceled the reservation. I emailed and called them many times, and they refused to acknowledge. I regret that I should have recorded our conversation. Those people are so dishonest! Stay clear or alert when dealing with their fraud. Shame on you!",1,2024,02,28
145,Perfect !,"We stay here when visiting London. This is located conveniently all main attractions and is walking distance to everything. Service is exceptional, checking in to walking by the front desk, everyone greets you all the time. They offer any assistance or ask if we need anything. The staff here go above and beyond and it not only ends at the front desk but the team at the restaurant and housekeeping were amazing.
They are going through some renovations so there is some noise and things have been moved around. The rooftop bar is now where the breakfast area is and trust me, it was perfect! Who would complain about having an amazing view for breakfast. But the staff here, they have my heart. Everyone was so attentive and helpful especially with allergies. The day we were we leaving they offered to pack nut free croissants for my son’s plane ride!! Who does that? People who truly care. I was teary eyed and my son enjoyed those on our 10hour plane ride. Breakfast has a great variety of items available.
Housekeeping team were awesome. They would check in daily on us to see if we needed anything additional and if our rooms were cleaned well.
In the evening we stopped by the rooftop bar for the view and was amazed how gorgeous it was. You can see the London Eye all lit up. 
If you need a place to stay while in London, this is your spot. Walking distance to everything and the perfect team to make your your stay comfortable.",4,2024,02,25
145,Strong recommendation,The hotel is in a wonderful location and all the staff were so helpful and friendly.  The breakfast was excellent and comes with a great view.  Tony the doorman was attentive and helpful with planning our trips and providing extra attention for my daughter who uses a wheelchair. Very strong recommendation for this Hilton.,5,2024,02,25
145,Part of the London experience,"We had a fantastic trip and a part of it was the comfort of this hotel. The doorman/greeter Toni helped make our trip special. He advised us in where to go and where to eat and was very friendly every time we passed him. The lobby staff was friendly and respectful as well. Overall if we get the chance to come back to London, we will stay here again.",5,2024,02,24
145,My 50th Birthday vacation,My husband and I spent my 50th birthday in London and chose this hotel.  The price was in our budget and we were very happy with our stay.  There was construction going on as they are remodeling but we were aware of that before we arrived.  The room was comfortable and the team made sure were happy and comfortable. The bed was very big and comfy as well.  The rooftop was awesome with beautiful views and delicious Mediterranean fare.  We would definitely come back as it's in a perfect area to see the sites.,5,2024,02,23
145,Great hotel!,"Highly recommend this Beautiful, clean hotel!  The staff was very attentive and helpful.  Perfect location!  This hotel is very close to all the popular sights… walking distance to Buckingham Palace.  There was some construction going on in and around the hotel but it was barely noticeable.  We really enjoyed our stay!",5,2024,02,22
145,Highly recommended,"Stunning venue, excellent location, the food was excellent but the best part was the staff. They really do want you to have the best experience. Although our booking didn’t go through (not their fault) they still accommodated us. We will definitely be back.",5,2024,02,18
145,Friendly Staff and a Great Location!,"Had a great week at the Trafalgar St. James! Our room was comfortable, clean, and cozy - a wonderful place to come back to at the end of the day. Especially lovely service from Toni, who made us feel so welcome, as well as the Rooftop hostess at breakfast every morning! The central location is wonderful if you are exploring London's museums and historic areas. Definitely recommend staying here! Thanks again to the friendly staff for making our stay feel special!",5,2024,02,17
145,Toni was excellent,"Hotel is undergoing some renovations which we were made aware of before booking.  Rooms were amazing.  Only one working lift which was very frustrating!
Staff were very helpful and Toni was fantastic.  A constant smile and eager to assist in any request
Thank you",4,2024,02,17
145,60TH BIRTHDAY ,"Called for lunch at the rooftop bar for my 60th birthday, what a fantastic find. The tapas was amazing, your staff were so lovely and made a massive fuss of me when they found out it was my birthday, finally I loved the orange wine, thank you again ♥️ ",5,2024,02,15
145,Nice and Noisy,"This was our third stay at the hotel which speaks for itself really as we  like it here.  However, on this occasion it was a little below par. We were aware when we booked that there was some  upgrading being done to the lobby but I don’t think we appreciated how noisy it would be. On top of that there is a huge construction going on at the side of the hotel too and again there was some noise from that also. We were woken both mornings by this as work started at 8am …

… I would expect that there would be some recognition of this in the hotel rates but there was not. … 

Would we return ? Possibly … but not until all of the construction is finished … it’s just not peaceful or relaxing for us there at the moment ….",3,2024,02,15
145,"Beautiful hotel, amazing staff! Perfect location.","Trafalgar Hilton is a beautiful boutique style hotel located at the Trafalgar Square. Literally steps to the National Museum, China Town, Soho and all the shopping you can ask (Regent, Bond) which stretch out to Oxford. Getting to all the other historical sites, like Buckingham ( 15 minute walk or a quick cab ride) and a 8-10 mins cab ride to Big Ben, Abbey and Eye. Unlike our first half of our trip where we stayed near Victoria station, our stay here felt more like a 'vacation' and definitely more touristy which is what we wanted. The staff at the hotel were fantastic and super welcoming throughout our stay. Hotel is super clean fashionably decorated, room was a good size, we had the one with the ""upper"" living room/fold out couch option that faced the Canadian Embassy and the Square itself. There was remodeling/renovation on the main floor which we believe would have given us a second option for food in the hotel, in any case, it did not bother since the rooftop covered us for breaktfast and provided lunch/dinner option if we were beat from spending the day around. Extra shout out to Donnie who was always helping us at the entrance, albeit with our stroller, hailing cabs and providing local recommendations daily! And Lidia who helped with offering a Valentine's themed weekend in our room with flowers, balloons and champagne!",5,2024,02,14
145,"A wonderful London vacation, right in the heart of Trafalgar!","We had a really lovely stay at The Trafalgar St James. The family room was clean and comfortable.  The breakfast was varied and delicious. We will definitely stay here again it was so centrally located with the Charring Cross station a mere stones throw.  The rooftop bar was outstanding, the views!!!! Wow! 
Replenishing the water and soft drinks regularly was a nice touch. We were very impressed and would recommend.",5,2024,02,12
145,Beautiful and cozy,"Rough start to our stay. Found out  lounge was closed for repair. One elevator was broken. Check in staff cold and less than helpful. After that first 1/2 day things got much better. The room is big and cozy. Super clean. Definitely gonna miss that shower!! Complimentary waters were much appreciated as well as Nespresso. Front staff, especially doorman, exceptionally nice and welcoming. Bar upstairs has nice views. Short walk to tube and bus.  Lots of fun nearby. Worth coming back - especially when lounge reopens.",4,2024,02,12
145,Relaxing treat of a mini break,"Amazing staff, incredible location and really nice room. Highly recommend for a fancy overnight stay but well priced for central london. We had a drink up at the rooftop bar and wow what a view! 

Really friendly reception team thank you for making me and my daughter feel so welcome and special. Amazing mum & daughter trip to celebrate Chinese new year",5,2024,02,11
145,Great experience,"Very happy with the hotel , staff and the concierge service was excellent. They were so helpful and kind .
Definitely would recommend this hotel to anyone looking for a good hotel in central London . Families with kids would appreciate the help from the staff more .",5,2024,02,06
145,Great hotel;great location,Brilliant staff. Lovely room. Complimentary minibar and Nespresso machine. Really couldn't ask for better. Ideal location for a weekend visit to London. Walking distance to many popular tourist attractions and a 2 minute walk to the nearest underground.,5,2024,02,05

145,Do not stay at this hotel during construction,"Do not stay at this hotel during ongoing construction.

We were woken by the drilling, that not only registered over 60db in our room, but the floor of our room was actually vibrating. I paid an average of £400 per night. The pneumatic drills digging out the basement are allowed to operate from 09.00 until 17.00.

The warning on their website does not mention that they are using industrial drills in the basement (a noise that can be heard and felt on all floors). It simply says ""The hotel will be undergoing lobby renovations"", which it is, with nary a drill in sight.

Following a request to move rooms we were placed in a much smaller room, that was not nearly as well appointed, but thankfully way less noise.

Having had to move rooms, I would have anticipated they would either upgrade us or provide us with the equivalent standard, particularly as I had to take the time to pack up the room mid trip.

The Aircon in the first room was silent, but excessively noisy in the new room. This is something I don't mind, but my travel companion is a lighter sleeper and was unable to sleep that night.

In amongst the packets of milk in the room was an already opened/gone off milk container with congealed foul smelling rotten milk, which my toddler drank most of prior to me realising it was off.

By way of an apology for the above, I was sent some chocolate with a personalised card, which was written to another guest - with their full (distinctive) name.

I received a lovely email from Christina Miranda on my return home, and I was happy to leave things there. 

However, when I wrote back I received a defensive email from another employee that was so entirely generic in response, it is clear they have to deal with numerous complaints and just cut and paste a response.

It is due to that email, that I have written this review. 

They referred to me in this second email by my surname (Dear Surname) - not first name and it was also miss-spelt.

All very Fawlty Towers.

The breakfast staff were delightful, the porter is a cheery chap and front desk were polite. Breakfast selection is average, the avocado toast is great. If you like Hilton, try the Hilton Park Lane for a breakfast selection that is stellar (and none of the other construction issues).

Either the hotel should block the rooms that are affected most by noise, or decrease the prices of the rooms to reflect the noise nuisance. The price I paid was in line with all other hotels of this standard in London in January.

Have downgraded my previous two star review to one, as they continue to insist that there is a warning on their website. However, that warning does not mention drilling, or the total disruption to your stay.

I was impressed by the tone of the first email I received, very kind and reasonable.  However, the further correspondence from the wider team is the reason I have decided to share my experience.",1,2024,01,20
145,Best experience you can find in London,"Exceptional hotel. Exceptional service despite the blemish of on site construction while I was there.Nice hearty breakfast, great restaurant,  super clean room. Its location allowed me to walk to nearly everywhere. A few times a short taxi ride but a brisk walk to most museums, Westminster Abbey, even theatre district, St Paul’s not too far. No car rental needed. Strongly recommended!!!",5,2024,01,16
145,Lovely Holiday Stay,"The Trafalgar St. James was a lovely hotel in a fantastic central location. Additionally, the service was top notch. We would highly recommend. The hotel staff went above and beyond to ensure that our stay was a pleasant one. We would return to this hotel on a future trip to London.",5,2024,01,11
145,Luxury and quality,"One of the most comfortable stays in London. I stay in many hotels but the Trafalar offers luxury, a personal service and good quality. I can recommend the hotel and its team for a short break or longer stay. Ideal for business and leisure, the location is perfect.",5,2024,01,10
145,First class experience!,"Booked the night to celebrate our daughter’s birthday in London. Lidia and the guest services team were fantastic with a little surprise in the room on check-in, and also with keeping us updated regards tube strikes etc.

Mainly booked this hotel because of previous great Hilton experiences, the central location and the double queen beds- not many hotels have this and given it was a treat for my daughter I wanted her to have a big bed too. The bathroom was fantastic with a nice big bath and luxurious soaps - so a hit with my wife too!

Every colleague we met went above and beyond to be polite and gave first class service. Breakfast was lovely with great views from the rooftop of Trafalgar Square.

Would heartily recommend!",5,2024,01,09
145,"Exceptional Staff, Hotel, and Location","My first visit to London and I couldn’t have picked a higher quality, centrally located hotel.  The staff (Adrian, Tony, Lalla, so many others) are superb and willing to help with any request.  
Daily breakfast was complimentary for Diamond members which is an incredible benefit - so much selection, always cooked well, and a nice dining environment.  I never had a wait for a table during my 7 day stay. 
The location is walkable to almost every famous site in London - including Westminster and Buckingham Palace, which are beautiful 10-minute walks just out the front door. 
My room was a standard king with no view, but it was modern, clean and well maintained with plenty of outlets.  Even though I was near the elevator and on a low floor, the room was exceptionally quiet and I never had an interrupted sleep. 
Very grateful to the whole team at this hotel for making my London introduction exceptional on every level. Cheers!",5,2024,01,07
145,Home from home!!!,"What can I say we have stayed at the hotel on numerous occasions and it just keeps getting better. It was my partners birthday and her flowers in reception when we arrived and champagne in the room just started our trip perfectly.

The concierge team are fantastic and nothing was any trouble from ordering our taxis to advice on restaurants before our theatre show . It feels like coming home every time to be remembered and greeted by members of the hotel team we have met on our previous trips. 

It was lovely to have breakfast on the rooftop  with stunning views over London, as per everything else the breakfast was fabulous.

This is more than a hotel with the personnel touches and attention to detail, if you want exceptional personal service this is the only place to stay.  

",5,2024,01,07
145,Fantastic choice and location,"While this was not the most inexpensive hotel we've ever stayed, it was the best.  The location is perfect, the attention to detail was superb, and the staff were friendly and professional without being inauthentic or obnoxious.  The room was larger than expected, the breakfast was outstanding, and everything worked as it should.  We highly recommend the Trafalgar St. James and hope to return in the future.",5,2024,01,03
145,"It’s more than a stay, it’s an experience","They say in real estate, the three most important things are location, location, location.  Even our Uber driver shared when we were picked up from the train station and headed to the hotel, that Trafalgar St. James is perfectly located in London.  Just literal steps from Trafalgar Square, the National Gallery, and a short walk to SoHo, Buckingham Palace, the London Eye, and so much more, Trafalgar St. James is perfectly located and situated for being in the heart of London.  But it has more than location, it has a charm and character that makes you feel both taken care of and at home all at the same time.  From dinner or drinks at the The Rooftop with gorgeous views of the city, to the upscale charm and curated drink menu at the Rockwell downstairs, you literally can stay in or have a drink or two before heading out on the town.  The staff is welcoming, kind, thoughtful, and clearly are invested in making the time you spend with them memorable and relaxing.  This is our second stay with Trafalgar St. James, and we will readily stay again.",5,2023,12,31
145,A most comfortable hotel.,The Trafalgar St James was a most comfortable hotel. Well located and the staff were super friendly and helpful. The breakfast buffet and a la carte options were plentiful and delicious. We also had a wonderful dinner at the Rooftop on Christmas Eve. Highly recommend this hotel!,5,2023,12,31
145,Well run hotel.,"Very comfortable hotel. Excellent breakfast in their very nice restaurant. There's a bit of construction going on around the place, and they seem to dig up Cockspur St everynight just for the fun of it so might be worth checking on the outlook of the room if thats still going on. Also they told me they are about to redevelop the lobby area so they'll need to manage that too.

A warning, don't buy anything in the ""local"" shops in this area as they will rip you off. The national chains (Boots/ Pret etc) are fine but otherwise stay away.",5,2023,12,30
145,Warmth in Winter,"well located property with clean updated rooms. The front desk was exceptional in checking us in early morning upon our flight to London. The property is in a unique bustling area of London with easy access to the underground and public transport.
The breakfast was great. The staff was truly the gem of this property. Had wonderful 5 days stay. Would definite return here.",5,2023,12,28
145,Magical Christmas ,"We had a magical Christmas stay, the hotel is absolutely beautiful, the Rooms are decorated to a very high standard which come with lovely amenities. The restaurants/ Roof terrace has lovely views of London alongside delicious food options. Most importantly the staff were great and made it the perfect stay, thank you and see you all again soon! ",5,2023,12,28
145,"Great rooms, amazing staff, and a perfect location.",This hotel is great. Nice big well appointed rooms in a perfect location And the staff was amazing.  They were so helpful as I navigated a passport issue and held a room for me until I got it resolved.  Thank you so much for an amazing experience during my time of crisis.,5,2023,12,27
145,Beware the upsell and the construction noise,"Arrived to the hotel after 16 hours of travel. We were quite exhausted. Upon checking in at 12pm, the front desk told us our room was almost ready and that we could hang out in the lobby or walk around for a bit while we wait. We explained that we had traveled for 16 hours and would gladly take ANY room they had available. The attendant told us that they had a room ready, but it would be an upcharge of $100/night. We then asked what time our originally room would be ready and the attendant said “I can only guarantee you 3pm”. Far from the “almost ready” from before. We paid the upcharge to get into a room right then, even though we felt it was a slimy move by the hotel. 

We get to our upgraded room and lay down to go to sleep. We immediately hear loud construction noise, as the hotel is under renovations. So we give them an extra $200 to get some sleep to find out we would be hearing construction noise. 

On the second day, they had their weekly test of the fire alarm system. 

A well located hotel with nice rooms. But beware of the upgrade sell and the loud construction noise.",3,2023,12,26
145,Great Hotel and Service,"The hotel service and the hotel itself was really good. Excellent service from Tony at the concierge and the hotel reception staff were excellent as well. The breakfast was good and the coffee was great. Thank you to all the hotel staff at breakfast, you were amazing. The only disappointment was the housekeeping but everyone else made up for it.",5,2023,12,26
145,First -Class Staff,"Carlo

145,Nice Hotel and Friendly Staff,Hotel was nice and staff were friendly. I loved having a kettle and espresso and teas available. Toni was helpful. Great location.

145,Perfect hotel experience!,"We had the privilege of staying in this hotel as the beginning of our vacation in December. We cannot say enough positives about the hotel. The location is ideal - accessible to several major attractions as well as easily accessible to major bus and tube routes. The staff is wonderful - friendly, efficient, and highly responsive. The room was perfect for our need and the morning breakfast was delicious. We hope to return as the hotel made our entire stay in London a pleasure!",5,2023,12,18
145,Wonderful experience at this Hoel ,"Would highly recommend this hotel - it was perfectly situated with Covent Garden, shopping and the Theatres all within a short walk - friendly and attentive staff, extremely comfortable rooms and the breakfast was outstanding.

145,Perfectly perfect! Stunning and fabulous!,"Absolutely unbelievable!!! I have never ever stayed in a hotel where I haven’t needed to have a little moan about something. Everything in this hotel was to the highest standard and spec and we thoroughly enjoyed our stay! I most definitely won’t be exploring other hotels now and this will be my forever ‘go to’ London hotel for the foreseeable future! 
The staff were incredibly polite and extremely helpful. They just consistently went above and beyond! Absolutely Fabulous!! Thank you!",5,2023,12,16

145,Amazing,Very friendly staff and very nice room. The porter Toni was especially nice and helpful. He helped us with all of our luggage he always called us a cab. The rooms were very clean and spacious. A big bonus was the beautiful roof terrace,5,2023,12,11
145,The location cannot be beat,My wife and I had a very nice stay at the Trafalgar St. James.  The central location in London cannot be beat.  Many sites and sections of London are either walkable or a short bus ride away.  The entire staff were cordial and helpful whenever we needed them.  The breakfast in the Rooftop Restaurant was fabulous.  Hotel guests could order a hot breakfast item like an omelet or poached eggs royal and have access to wide selection at the breakfast bars.  The service was fast and the food fresh and tasty.,4,2023,12,11
145,Great place to stay,"A really great hotel to stay in London. Right at the tube, Canada House and Trafalgar Square. The rooftop lounge is off the hook. Staff are all attentive and supporting, especially Toni. We loved our room, the restaurants and the people.",5,2023,12,10
145,Really enjoyed our stay ,"Great stay, amazing staff/service and the locatlon was excellent. Also Toni at the door was very helpful! The breakfast was very good and the service was quick. The hotel location was ideal because it was a close walk to landmarks like the Palace and Big Ben. In addition to the bars/restaurants at Mayfair and soho. ",5,2023,12,08
145,A great hotel in a fantastic location.,"I stayed in the Trafalgar St. James for business recently. It was only for 1 night but I had a very enjoyable stay. The hotel is located just off of Trafalgar Square so you couldn't ask for a better location, but despite this central location the rooms are quiet and the traffic noise doesn't enter them. The hotel itself is modern and stylish, and the staff are very welcoming and pleasant. The rooms are the real selling point from my perspective, very large and generously designed with plenty of storage and finished to a high quality. The bed is incredibly comfortable and the shower provides a great wake up in the morning. I have booked this hotel again, for longer stays, based on this 1 night, and I hope to try out the bar and rooftop terrace! ",5,2023,12,08
145,Trafalgar View!,"This is a very nice and well-located boutique hotel.  It is adjacent to a major hotel construction site at Admiralty Arch which can be noisy.  After our first night, the very pleasant and efficient rooms manager, Lidia, relocated us to a larger room on the quiet side of the building.  The views of Trafalgar Square are spectacular (especially at night) from the rooftop restaurant, which has both indoor and outdoor tables.  We would definitely stay here again.",4,2023,12,07
145,"Fantastic and spacious hotel in a great location with wonderful staff, what more could you ask for?!","We recently stayed at the hotel after arriving at one we had already booked and choosing not to stay there. We were very lucky that the hotel had availability and had chosen it as we had faith in the Hilton name, which of course did not let us down!

It’s safe to say it was one of the best decisions we’ve made as the hotel did not disappoint! The location was amazing and within walking distance for wherever we needed to be (we were at a wedding in Soho but also enjoyed some Christmas shopping). On arrival we were feeling weary, tired and stressed after a day of travel and then the disappointment with our previous hotel. The staff were wonderful, attentive and gave us a room upgrade which was perfect particularly given how we were feeling at the time! The room was beautiful and spacious, with a large shower with gorgeous Molton brown toiletries. The bed was comfy and overall everything felt far too luxurious and spacious given the price we paid! 

There was some building work being carried out both within the hotel and outside but that didn’t seem to cause us any disturbance in regards to the noise. In fact given such a central and bustling location noise was of no problem which I must admit I was pleasantly surprised by! The building work did mean that there was only one lift running which did impact on timeliness given it is such a busy hotel. This wasn’t a problem for us as we were just happy to be there and relax however I just mention it in case other travellers may find this information useful.

The breakfast was served in the beautiful Roof terrace which had absolutely stunning views! It was an amazing location for breakfast and our little boy would’ve loved to of been able to of spotted all the sights! We will have to have a return visit so he can enjoy it! The food and variety was really good including options of vegan brownies and flapjacks, cooked breakfast and continental items. My only suggestion would be in regards to cooked vegetarian or vegan options. Both days I enquired as to vegetarian alternatives for sausages/bacon/cooked breakfast which too be fair the staff responded to and sourced but I did find this unusual for a hotel of this standard, location and chain that such items weren’t readily available or even advertised/listed as options. There was no indicator that such items were available and on the second day one of the waiting staff simply replied no when I enquired, however on speaking to another member of staff there were alternatives available and these were provided. It’s such a shame too as they were some of the best vegetarian sausages I’ve ever had so remember to ask as they’re worth it! 

Overall we had such a splendid stay and is a hotel I would definitely return to for lots of reasons! I would highly recommend it and would love to return!",5,2023,12,07
145,This should be your go-to London hotel!,"An excellent hotel, ideally situated, with very pleasant and helpful staff. Can’t rate highly enough!

Great location near major sites and attractions. Would highly recommend a stay.",5,2023,12,07
145,Excellent hotel in the middle of London!,"We had a 6 day stay at the hotel, which we had visited several years previously
1.  The room was quiet and comfortable.
2.  The staff was uniformly friendly and helpful:  including the concierges, front desk, doormen, bellmen, and bar/restaurant staff.
3.  The location is incomparable.
We look forward to going back soon!",5,2023,12,06
145,Short but nice trip to London,"This hotel is awesome. The location is perfect as it is walking distance to so many different restaurants, pubs, theaters, attractions, etc. The personnel is nothing but super helpful. Service was superb. The cherry on top was the rooftop bar, the drinks were on point, some of our favorites ever. Finally, Jeremiah and Raja were super helpful at the bar, always finding us a table and getting our drinks, blankets, etc. they were very funny. ",5,2023,12,05
145,Loved it,"The location is excellent, in the middle of all important areas. Everything in the room was perfect, and the staff were so friendly.

145,Friendly staff and atmosphere! ," I highly recommend staying at this hotel. The staff are incredibly accommodating and friendly.

145,Family Visit,"An absolute gem of a place to stay in. We stayed in a family room from 1st December to 4th December. From check in until
Checkout the service was impeccable. A big shout out to all the staff for being so welcoming and attentive but especially to Kristen and the doorman who couldn’t do enough for us. On booking in Kristen made an absolute fuss of my grandson and presented him with his own special key for the lift and room. The cleanliness of the hotel was outstanding. I could not fault one single thing about it. Definitely worth a visit and it is so central",5,2023,12,03
145,First class hotel. Friendly clean and perfect location ,Such a fab hotel. Amazing friendly helpful staff. Room was beautiful so clean and spacious. Breakfast on rooftop bar amazing views and tasty food. They give my wee boy his own keycard shaped of a lion and it was the highlight of his trip taking control of opening door etc. it was a birthday celebration and they give up a bottle of Prosecco and cupcakes but also a wee kids bag with treats for my wee boy. The doorman was so friendly and attentive. The front of house kirstin i think he was called was so helpful and friendly. I definitely would stay here again. ,5,2023,12,03
145,"Perfect location, excellent door man Toni",Fabulous day staff was amazing especially Toni on the door. Location was perfect as you are a stones through away from all your needs. The rooms were luxurious which was lovely as it made it easy for us to relax. The rooftop bar was phenomenal and the views were to die for. Fabulous stay and Toni topped it off. ,5,2023,12,02
145,Amazing Stay ,"We stayed at the hotel from Nov 23 to Nov 29 for our honeymoon and it was beyond amazing! 
Staff: Super friendly and a big shout out to Lidia! Through email communication, she learned it was our honeymoon, and she provided a complimentary upgrade for us to a junior king suite and received a bottle of champagne and cupcakes as part of the celebration. We were beyond grateful! 
Room: Junior King Suite is wonderful! Super spacious, love the bathroom and the espresso machine! Both my husband and I are super picky about bed, but their bed is amazing. Last but not least, the room is very quiet, I was a little bit concerned about traffic noise b/c of how central the location is, but we could barely hear anything throughout our stay. 
Location: Super central to everything, and very close to tube/bus location, uber is always a minute away from the hotel. 
Service: room service is terrific, and the front desk is always super helpful! 
Breakfast: Wonderful continental breakfast buffet and a breakfast menu to order. Also love the pastry and fruit they provide.  
Rooftop Bar: We did not eat there, but we had drinks at the bar. Great ambiance, a variety of selections to choose from. 
Renovation: We couldn't hear any renovation noise in the morning before we went on our excursions and at night after we got back. 
Overall, we love it, and will come back for sure! ",5,2023,11,30
145,Perfect,"During my stay at your hotel,I was very pleased with everything.The warm and respectful nature of the staff,coupled with the exceptional management under the General Manager’s guidance,truly made my experience remarkable.The hotel’s prime location also added to its appeal,offering convenience and proximity to various attractions.Additionally, the rooms were stylish and immaculate, providing a clean and comfortable environment.The rooftop restaurant’s stunning views added an extra layer of beauty to the stay.Next time I come to London, I will choose to stay in your hotel again.",5,2023,11,30
145,Great Service!,"Really great hotel, great location with a view of Trafalgar Square. Service was brilliant (especially Tony on the door who is such an asset to the hotel!) 

Rooms nice, clean and modern.

Only thing that let it down is I’m allergic to feathers so called before I arrived to let them know and asked again at reception who assured me it was feather free only to find feather bedding in my room! 

Other than that, a great stay!",4,2023,11,30
145,Birthday celebration ,"Friendly staff, beautiful and clean room, very tasty food, perfect stay for my birthday celebration with my family. Definitely will come back and recommend to everyone who are visiting London, hotel just in front of Trafalgar Square ",5,2023,11,29
145,Excellent experience with excellent service!,"Stayed for a few nights to start my honeymoon throughout the UK and I loved this hotel! First, the staff is always SUPER friendly, not matter the hour. 

The room was a spectacle in itself. Spacious, comfy and very tall ceilings. The rooftop was probably where we spent most of the time. Breakfast is amazing there with a great view of the Trafalgar Square. At night, the drinks were spectacular!",5,2023,11,28
145,Excellent stay .. loved the hotel and location,"Excellent stay and the staff were super helpful. Keshav at reception was very helpful and there to assist. Also would like to mention Tony .. still remember his name always there to get the cab and give you helpful tips on where to go. 
Also would like to mention the amazing breakfast in the morning at the rooftop. The views of the skyline are amazing in the evening.",5,2023,11,28

145,Best place to stay in London,"
We truly enjoyed our stay at the hotel.  It was our second trip to London this year, and we cannot wait to return to both the city as well as the St. James.  The hotel is lovely, with beautifully composed rooms and thoughtful shared spaces.  The rooms are nicely sized, and the beds were lovely.  So many small details demonstrate the thought put into a guest's stay, from the selection of just-right pillows to the oversized bath-sheet style towels.  While I really enjoyed the Rooftop space and the views it provided, the ground floor restaurant genuinely feels like a tropical oasis where you can relax and breathe.  Both locations have their own charm, each with wonderful sightlines and personality.

And while the facilities are lovely, what really sets the St. James apart from so many of the other hotels I have experienced is the staff.  Everyone we spoke to was lovely, from the smiling doorman to the entire ground floor staff.  And when I walked past the following day, one gentleman recognized me and called me by name to confirm our stay was going well..

Simply put, the concierge team was wonderful.  Tom is a joy, and you can tell from the way he interacts with the guests that he truly loves what he does.  He is personable, warm, and demonstrates a degree of care that is so very genuine.  Gabriel, one of the service staff, is a treasure as well - he recognized us at the Admiralty pub across the street during his off hours, gesturing for us to join his party.  That type of personal care is virtually unheard of in today's world and will not be forgotten.

The entire team made us feel so very welcome, much more like guests than short-term clients.  We will return as soon as our schedule permits.",5,2023,11,26
145,Will stay again.,"We stayed in London for 5 nights and stayed for 3 nights.  I wish we could have stayed for the entirety.  The location is superb.  There are construction noises because of the next-door building.  Busy street but overall, not noisy to interrupt sleep.  Staffs are all very courteous and helpful.  Loved everyone from the moment we checked in to checking out.  I will stay again.",5,2023,11,26
145,Great Trip!,"The Staff was Amazing, from Gerard checking in, the concierge team booking our reservations and Toni helping us get our ride to the airport! Location is convenient to so much! Rooftop bar is a very nice touch!",5,2023,11,25
145,Prefect place from which to enjoy vibrant central London,"We had a wonderful stay. A lovely, spacious and meticulously clean room on the 5th floor with a very comfortable bed. We had a very warm welcome at reception and an equally friendly farewell as we left the next morning. 
A great hotel from which to enjoy the vibrant entertainment of central London. 

We will return.",5,2023,11,22
145,Excellent Service,"We had two rooms and stayed at the hotel from Nov 14th - 22nd.  The hotel staff couldn't be more attentive and were extremely helpful.  If you are visiting the sites of London, this is perfectly situated and you can walk or get the underground which is very close.  We thoroughly enjoyed out stay and would stay there again.  Highly recommend!",5,2023,11,21
145,Racist Reception,"Worst reception manager, I arrived on Nov 10 staying till 19th. He was racist and disrespectful. I paid in advance my booking for the 10 days so all wanted is some respect and we I tried to cancel told that he will charge me 3 nights what a joke, I wanna be racist with you and if you want to cancel I will charge you. 
Alotaibi",1,2023,11,20
145,Fantastic location and wonderful staff! ,"We stayed here a week and it was the perfect stay for us. Right off Trafalgar Square, you are close to everything (tube, restaurants, museums). The room was comfortable and had extra space, which was nice for a week long trip (we upgraded to a St. James King). No noise at all even though we were across fromt the Square. The staff was just wonderful to deal with, everyone was so friendly and helpful. And I mean everyone. 

We opted for the breakfast included and enjoyed that every day. Much easier than having to run out and find something every morning. The food was excellent, not your typical generic breakfast. 

I recommend having a couple drinks up at the rooftop bar after a long day, nice and relaxing. It was chilly and the heaters were great. A nice view of the city and the London Eye as well. 

Overall, a great place to stay while in London!",5,2023,11,20
145,When in a great place people can make a difference!,"Perfect location. Many emblematic London attractions are 5 mins walking distance. 
The hotel follows a smart casual fashion that  makes it very pleasant for the exhausted tourist or businessman.
The personnel is always ready to offer any support required. Lidia, the guest relations manager, is an amazing professional. With her friendliness and to do attitude adds a lot to the flair of the place.",5,2023,11,18

145,"Outstanding, personal, friendly and caring service ","Excellent welcome outside the hotel by two friendly and polite gentleman, a very helpful porter and delightful checkin persons. Room was excellent, well appointed, quiet, warm and comfortable with a fine view of Trafalgar Square. The available restaurant was exactly that required for afternoon tea, an early pre-show meal, and a very good breakfast the following day (with magnificent views over London). All the staff, from senior management to the lady servicing our room, were friendly, polite and caring. Checkout was simple, again with the duty porter going “above and beyond” by accompanying my wife and I across the road to secure a taxi. In fact, that is the term I should use for all the staff: “Above and beyond”. For theatre-land, an ideal place to stay. Highly recommended, we will be back.",5,2023,11,15
145,Hotel with excellent central London location for a weekend stay,"Cannot compliment enough, the attitude of all members of the staff, from the doormen, receptionists, waiters and waitresses and all other staff that we encountered. What a fantastic experience we had, highly recommend and can’t wait for our next opportunity to visit.",5,2023,11,15
145,Perfect Location & Wonderful Staff,"Had a wonderful time at The Trafalgar St. James! We were warmly greeted by Toni upon arrival who assisted with luggage and taxi services. At the reception desk, the 3 front desk agents were extremely helpful with getting us early check-in and complimentary Diamond upgrade. The room was very clean and had the perfect ambiance. Later in the evening, we were surprised by Lidia, who sent us a wonderful amenity, welcoming us to London!

The hotel is also very central to all the attractions! There was a Christmas market on the square, a mere seconds from the hotel. You can’t miss the rooftop bar, which has a great view of the city and the London eye in the background. Although we did not have reservation to the rooftop bar, staff warmly greeted us and accommodated us. 

Thank you to the staff for making a memorable stay for us! A truly wonderful experience and will be sure to return to this hotel on our next travels to London.",5,2023,11,14
145,Amazing!,"I had amazing experience at The Trafalgar St. James and became to my favorite Hotel in London! Extremetly wonderfull location, easy access to all attraction areas by walking. Hotel staff very friendly, helpful and they are interest shown like one of your friend since long time…
Specially thank you to Lidia, Juan, Toni, Keshav.

Rooms are modern, clean and comfortable and providing different type of accommodation for the guests.

The Rooftop has wonderfull view of Trafalgar Square and London Eye and you should teste signature coctails! Enjoy it!",5,2023,11,14
145,“Truth” in Advertising,"Pros: Exemplary staff through & through.

Cons: Being offered, unsolicited, 2 upgrade options at check-in and being told I’d have to pay for either one (I did not as I “thought” Diamond Members were upgraded for free based upon availability), and paying extra for a “room with a view” which in fact was obstructed by rooftops and a crane (see photo) allowing us to see approximately 1/4 of The Eye (I did, which I regret).",3,2023,11,13
145,Amongst the best …..,Hotel in perfect position in Central London. Staff very helpful and friendly and everything was to the usual Hilton high standards. Our room was large with a lovely bathroom and perfectly prepared for our stay. Sadly we only had the opportunity to try the Rooftop Bar for food and drink but this could not be bettered - with simply stunning views across London from Trafalgar Square to the London Eye. Would very much recommend this hotel. ,5,2023,11,11
145,Great Location-Central to all,"Our experience at the hotel was amazing!  We had looked at a lot of different hotels but would say from a location perspective it is perfect.  You can easily walk, Uber, or take the tube anywhere.  With Regent Street and SOHO so close there are a ton of dining options.  Also the rooftop restaurant/bar is great for breakfast as well as a drink",5,2023,11,09

145,Exceptional property. Exceptional service.,Our stay at The Trafalgar St James was perfect.  The room was cozy and comfortable.  Everything worked.  The staff treated us exceptionally well.  Everyone was so nice to us.  I can’t imagine staying any place else if we return to London.,5,2023,11,06

A great experience for our visit to London and so centrally located.",5,2023,10,31
145,Top notch hotel team!!,"Best hotel experience we’ve ever had! Remus, Keshau and Michael Neal were  the best at delivering service above and beyond! They were engaging and so helpful. And friendly! We were sad to leave because we enjoyed our conversations. Treats were delivered to our room to celebrate our birthdays and anniversary. Made us feel so special! Will return every single time we find ourselves in London!",5,2023,10,28
145,"Another 5-star review: great service, location and rooms","Yes, it's another 5-star review for the tremendous St. James. The staff are exceptional, as others have commented, from checkin through checkout. The concierge team helped us with a number of arrangements, and Adrian consistently went above and beyond throughout our stay. 

Don't have your heart set on a view of the square... the hotel's corner is on the square but the majority of the hotel faces the Canadian embassy right across the street. The rooms are quiet with the exception of a little vibrating bass as some cars drive by with their music booming. Can't do much about that - there are multiple windows providing soundproofing and we did not find it bothersome.

The Rooftop bar is wonderful and they do not apply the minimum spend to St. James guests. They also save us the best seats, another example of them taking good care of their guests.

The ongoing remodel is noisy in the lobby. Loud grinding occurs periodically and one of the elevators is out of service to take care of the construction workers. We didn't have to wait long and sometimes we used the hidden service elevator to the left of the elevator bank. Secret: you can get to the Rooftop from that elevator with your room key.

Breakfast was efficient and in a beautiful space and featured the usual mixture of eggs etc on the buffet as well as an a la carte menu.

Overall a wonderful experience in a GREAT location. Thank you St. James!

",5,2023,10,28
145,Great experience!,"First time to stay at this lovely hotel - & the whole team made our stay very special indeed. The room was delightful and we enjoyed time spent at the Rockwell bar & restaurant - staff were attentive and friendly. Breakfast was first class. The reception team were very kind, especially Jackson, who we felt personally looked after us throughout. During the evening a protest march at Trafalgar Square had become a little scary, however I think that many of the staff had stayed on to help guests. It was very kind of them - they offered to walk with us if we were going out. Thanks team - we will definitely be back!",5,2023,10,27
145,Great stay at a great location.,"Fantastic stay. Great location and wonderful service.

Can’t say enough about this hotel,5,2023,10,18
145,Service at its Best!,"My week-long business trip last week was simply amazing. The location of being in the heart of London is one thing, but the services I received were the main factors why I will be going back again. From my contacts with the front desk and concierge, before I flew into the UK, till the moment I left for the airport to fly home, it has been a pleasant experience. Literally, the touchpoints from Kate to Michael, to Keshva, to François, to the housekeeping crews, and back to Michael, were just superb. The room was great and clean, the gym was well-equipped, and every staff I came in contact with made me feel like I was returning home after a long business day. The services I get are worth the price I pay. Keep it up, TTSJ!",5,2023,10,16
145,A Great Hotel and Staff,"My wife and I stayed here last week during our holiday in London and France.  We upgraded our room to a small suite for a reasonable incremental price, and food the room size and amenities to be to our liking.  The hotel staff was welcoming, not only on arrival, but all during our stay.  The hotel location is great for touring, and small enough to feel quaint, with the amenities expected from a Hilton property.",5,2023,10,16
145,Wonderful London experience,"I from the very first steps off our plane the trafalfar st James was perfect. They arranged for a driver to pick us up from the airport which I have to say after a long trip was so comforting.  Once we got to their hotel every staff member greeted us kindly and offered their assistance.  It was late when we arrived so we felt so relaxed to be received in such a manner. 
In particular Lidia the staff manager was so accommodating. Also the doormen Tony and the others were so helpful with directions and hailing transportation.   The bellman were also great.  In particular Juan.  
From the bar to the restaurant all the staff were friendly and helpful.  
This hotel truly made our first London  experience absolutely perfect.  
Thank you Trafalgar st James.  Cannot wait to return",5,2023,10,16
145,Trafalgar Squre From Your Window! ,"Room 203 is a corner room that looks directly at the Trafalgar Square monument (Horatio Nelson is at the top). This is a great room in a great hotel. (See nighttime photo attached.)

The Trafalgar St. James is a classy property--not just for the location but because the people make it so. Attention to detail. Service. Directions (!!) and recommendations.

The location is in the center of a TON OF STUFF you can do by walking. The Thames, Parliament and more, while a good walk, was not too far away. The National Gallery is just the other side of the square and shops and shops and shops are all over the place. From upscale shopping to picking up a Red Bull or a tourist T-shirt--it's all in walking distance. 

A bit longer of a walk but still not too far is Westminster Abbey. A must visit.

So much more. We highly recommend The Trafalgar St. James and are perfectly comfortable suggesting you consider this property.",5,2023,10,15
145,The Trafalgar St James. Simply exceeded expectations,"From booking to check in the staff simply outperformed our expectations.

145,Excellent Hotel - Highly recommended,Stayed here for 5 days with family visiting the sights of London. The Hotel is extremely well situated for all the main attractions of central London. We walked every day and for the first time ever didn’t need to take a cab anywhere. The hotel room (family Queen Room) was very spacious and very comfortable. The staff were all extremely friendly and helpful- in particular Tony the Doorman. Tony greeted us every day with a smile and his cheery disposition really made our stay. This hotel is highly recommended- and we will definitely be back!,5,2023,10,13

145,"Centrally Located, reasonable priced, Five Star Service Hotel","My ten person family and I just recently stayed at the Trafalgar St. James and had an amazing experience. The location is perfect. The price per night we found to be very reasonable. The service was five star. There was no request that wasn't timely taken care of. The room was always cleaned, the front of the house staff answered any question we had, the doorman was always there greeting us and making sure Uber was guided to the front entrance. We have stayed in far more expensive hotels than this and I would like the staff to know that your attention to detail and care you showed to our family has created one of the most memorable and best hotel stays we have ever had. I would recommend this hotel to anyone that was looking for a high end, service oriented hotel, centrally located and priced much less than its competition. You have all done an amazing job!",5,2023,10,11
145,Excellent stay with good status recognition - I will return,"I love The Trafalgar. I've now stayed twice, once with my wife and once with my brother. Both times, the service was absolutely fantastic. The rooms are large and comfortable with excellent beds and a complimentary minibar including water (both still and sparkling) and coffee.

Status recognition is good. The included breakfast for Gold and Diamond members is really solid - I loved the avocado toast and the buffet offerings.

I will 100% stay at The Trafalgar again when I return to London. The location is great for tourism and, given how easy it is to get around London in general, I feel like you can be anywhere you need to be from the hotel in a reasonable amount of time.

Tony, the doorman, was very helpful in recommending restaurants and activities. I really appreciated chatting with him on a few occasions. ",5,2023,10,09

Our stay at the Trafalgar St. James was simply delightful. The accommodations were top of the line, the staff friendly and welcoming and the cleanliness was excellent. The beds were comfortable, the rooms were nicely decorated and the power button to turn on and off the smart shower was super exciting. Oh, the little things in life, can be big!

145,The Perfect Location,"If you are looking for a place to stay in London, that is close to theaters, museums, and iconic attractions, look no further than The Trafalgar St. James. The entire staff was wonderful. When I arrived, the door man and front desk staff greeted me like a long lost friend. After a 9 hour flight and lost luggage, it was this warm welcome that put a smile back on my face. The staff was helpful with directions and restaurant recommendations. The room was spotless and the bed was soft and comfortable. I loved the shortbread in the room each day to go with my tea. The continental breakfast was a delicious and filling way to start the morning. The Rooftop restaurant had amazing views and wonderful food. I highly recommend this hotel when you visit London.",5,2023,09,28
145,Perfect hotel in the center of everything!,"The Trafalgar St. James is in the perfect location, just off Trafalgar Square and walking distance to the Theater District, Buckingham Palace and all the popular sights.

Mr. Thomas from the Guest Experience Team reached out to me before my trip to check to see if I needed any help with reservations or transportation. Our flight to London was rerouted and cancelled until the next day. I sent a note to Mr. Thomas and he was very accommodating.

The room was extremely comfortable, clean and quiet. The rooftop bar was the perfect spot for a late night dinner and drinks. The views of London from the rooftop bar were incredible.

The staff and concierge were welcoming, friendly and helpful during every interaction.

I was nervous about where to book our stay in London. So many recommendations from friends at places that cost over $1500 per night. This gem, The Trafalgar St. James was very reasonably priced with outstanding service and accommodations. I highly recommend this hotel.",5,2023,09,27
145,Wonderful experience,"First of all the staff was wonderful, the location was the best possible, the breakfast was delicious. The roof top bar had beautiful views.  Housekeeping was the best.  When I go back to London this will be the only place I will go",5,2023,09,25
145,We're definitely coming back!,"The service is superb! Was there in the weekend for a hubby's birthday weekend date. Kurtis made sure my surprise was extra lovely and waiting in our room when we got there! Kevran and Ingrid made our stay even better with a free room upgrade and cocktails at the Rooptop! The view is amazing! Location is right in the middle of London with Trafalgar Square as its next door neighbour and yet in the room its so easy to forget you're central.  Oh and the bed?! Just heavenly and did I mention the people behind this hotel really thoight of everything, the hotel keycard is wooden and embedded with a seed that you can plant after us!!! This hotel definitely up there in my tops in London! ",5,2023,09,25
145,Style in the Heart of London,"For our first visit to London, my wife and I wanted to stay as close to the City center as possible for easy access to all of the sites. After reading many reviews, we decided to book with The Trafalgar St. James, right in the heart of London. From the beginning of our booking, the concierge team was in contact with us and very responsive to emails. They arranged transportation and provided detailed information about shows, attractions, and restaurants. When we arrived we were greeted by Tony and Adrien. The entire staff was professional and courteous. The Trafalgar St. James is perfectly located within 5 to 15 minutes walking distance to most of the major sites like Buckingham Palace, Soho & Covent Garden as well as Big Ben, Parliament, and Westminster Abbey. The room was very clean and quiet. The king-size bed was extremely comfortable. If I had to find a fault the lighting system was a little misplaced and the shower was snug. Otherwise, given the chance, I would gladly stay at The Trafalgar St. James again on my next trip to London.",5,2023,09,24
145,Roof Top Cocktail Bar,"Situated in the heart of the city and at one of London's most iconic landmarks, The Rooftop, is an oasis set high in the sky overlooking Trafalgar Square and London's spectacular skyline.

The cocktail and drinks menu are broad and the team are warm, friendly and engaging.

Offering a seasonally changing menu of delicious European-inspired dishes and a carefully curated cocktail and drinks selection, The Rooftop is the perfect spot to unwind, relax and soak up those London views.",5,2023,09,24
145,I highly recommend this hotel!!! ,"Due to a delayed flight we arrived at this hotel at 300am.  We were greeted with such kindness and wonderful customer service.  At 300am, I could of been happy sleeping anywhere. But we lucked out and received an up grade to our room.  They had us stay in the Barry Suite.  This is one of the most beautiful hotel rooms I've ever stayed in.  Every design detail was PERFECT.  The bed was amazing, just like sleeping on a cloud.  The next morning we have the most most fabulous breakfast.  This a hotel that I would definitely stay in again the next time we are in London",5,2023,09,22
145,Wonderful Stay,"We had the most wonderful stay at The Trafalgar St. James London. The food was amazing and all staff went above and beyond making sure we were comfortable, and welcomed. The location is perfect as it is only a short walk to many attractions and the underground just outside. After our busy day out we were greeted with a lovely surprise of cakes for my husbands birthday, arranged by the manager. Nothing was too much trouble for the staff and all were very attentive. The rooms were clean and comfortable, a perfect place to relax after a busy day.Thank you to all at The Trafalgar St. James for making our stay a memorable. ",5,2023,09,22
145,Wonderful weekend,Fabulous weekend at  the Trafalgar St James.  The hotel is so conveniently located. The rooms were very comfortable.  The Breakfast was delicious and the Staff were superb. Many thanks to Tony the doorman for the warm welcome.,5,2023,09,21
145,"Hotel was great, Rooftop Bar has problems","I would start this review by saying the staff at this venue / check-in desk were excellent and helpful.  The stay was very good and I would recommend it to anyone, with one caveat.  

The manager of the Rooftop bar, ""George"" was, an absolute disgrace.  Now, as a Diamond Member I have stayed at Hilton's for years all over the world, and - NEVER in that time have I had such a poor experience with one person solely responsible.  

When I made the booking (in person) it was for 5pm - to enjoy the sundown experience and lovely view.  Some time later George came over and said it was ""time to leave"" as the booking was only for an hour.""  Standing right in my space and acting more like a mafia hitman than a hospitality professional.  

He also asked what Id said the waiter (as a few around the space had laughed at the comment - which was a genuine compliment, to which all present would attest) - so he then realised he was in the wrong, looked a bit disappointed and decided to say ""ok I give you 30 minutes extra but then you must leave.""

 (I was not told the booking had an expiry and if I was, I wouldnt have booked that time).  This man ruined the stay, it was embarrassing and unnecessary. 

So beware the Rooftop bar and if you book, make sure you know how long it is for - and be warned about this egregious and solipsistic individual.",4,2023,09,19
145,My Trafalgar St James Stay,"The Trafalgar St James is a wonderful hotel. The staff is very friendly and helpful. The room was very nice. Housekeeping made sure the room was cleaned well daily. Water and soft drinks were replenished daily. The rooftop restaurant and bar was also very nice, with an amazing view. We included breakfast in with our stay, the food was good and the coffee was great. Some of the best coffee I've had in some time. Overall I had a great stay, the staff was excellent and I would recommend this hotel if you're planning to visit London.",5,2023,09,17
145,Would recommend,"Excellent position for most points to visit.After being out all day we would have enjoyed the rooftop bar, to see londonderry lit up, but unfortunately it was closed earlier than stated.would definitely recommend this Hotel.",5,2023,09,17
145,Beautiful Oasis in the Heart of London,"What a wonderful oasis in the heart of London.  This high-quality boutique hotel goes almost unnoticed in the south west corner of Trafalgar Square, nestled alongside a classic British pub, The Admiralty.  

What separates this hotel from many other 5-star properties is the staff.  They really are exceptional, from Tony the doorman to the desk staff, concierges, and restaurant staff.  The is a real spirit de corps here and it manifests itself in great service to its guests.  

We have stayed in quality 5-star hotels around the world but our stay at The Trafalgar St James will remain in our memories for a long time.  

An expansive dining area on the ground floor is lined with greenery and rich furnishings. The included breakfast with Gold Hilton Honors was excellent with a good range of hot buffet items, plus complimentary eggs and omelettes cooked to order.  Waiting staff are very attentive and empty plates are quickly cleared, without you feeling you are being rushed.

The Trafalgar is within easy walking distance to many of the West End’s theatres and attractions and has good public transport options.  Charing Cross station is located just a few minutes walk to the right of the hotel, and the No.9 bus stops right outside the hotel.  The No.9 can take you west to Harrods and the Royal Albert via Piccadilly Circus and Hyde Park Corner.  If you need to get to the Eurostar at St Pancreas, the No.91 will take you all the way to Kings Cross Station.  

The rooms are beautifully appointed with quality toiletries, beds, sheets, and pillows.   One issue that became apparent was that we had an interconnecting room where sound leaked though occasionaly.  We found it a bit annoying listening to our neighbour’s voices at odd hours, and I’m sure they felt the same about us.   I would recommend the hotel looks at better sound proofing on the interconnecting doors, or even better, removing some of them and walling up the cavities.

We really loved this hotel.   When you travel, you often say, “That was a wonderful stay. We’ll be back.” But when you actually revisit that city, you feel you should try something new, because life is short and you want to experience as much diversity as possible.  But the Trafalgar St James is one hotel we will return to next time we are London.

145,Great property,"Upon arrival I was greeted cordially. The room was well appointed, clean and comfortable. The location couldn’t have been better. The food and view from restaurant was lovely. Overall a wonderful experience in London. ",5,2023,09,13

145,Another fab stay at the Trafalgar St. James!,"Another fabulous stay at the Trafalgar St. James!My daughters and I love staying at the Trafalgar St. James and we always have an enjoyable, memorable stay. It is in the perfect location and the rooms are lovely, but it is the amazing people working there that bring us back. As a Gold Hilton member, I was given a warm welcome by Ingrid and an upgrade to a room with a view. Kurtis Huggins, Duty Manager, sent a kind message and a lovely fruit basket up to our room. We were offered a welcome drink at the roof-top bar and the scrumptious breakfast was included (as a Hilton Gold member). I only wish I knew the names of the breakfast room staff as they really made our morning (along with the delicious food!). Even though we know London pretty well, the concierge team-Michael Neal and Tom Howard- gave us good advice. We also enjoyed lunch/dinner in the restaurant and roof-top bar. I highly recommend the Trafalgar St. James for a truly enjoyable stay in London.",5,2023,09,07
145,You can stay here with confidence and convenience,"We were so very pleased with our stay at the Trafalgar St James.
The location is superb, and we were able to walk to many attractions, including Buckingham Palace, and the Churchill War Rooms. There is a hop-on-hop-off bus stop very close by. 

Upon arrival, we were lucky enough to be checked in by Kurtis Huggins. He was extremely helpful, pleasant and enthusiastic. We were discussing upgrades with him, and the computer was not as cooperative as it could have been. Kurtis worked with it, got us a lovely room, and then arranged for us to be upgraded for the remainder of our stay, after a room move on  August 14. He also comped us for a drink up on the Rooftop Bar. Be sure to make a reservation for the Rooftop bar--great views  and yummy food! He continued to be friendly and looking out for us during our stay.

Michael, one of the Concierge staff, booked multiple attractions for us on Monday morning. Because of the tentative itinerary we presented, it took a pretty fair amount of effort to ticket everything. We were so grateful for Michael's knowledgeable assistance. I had also been in contact with the concierge staff, prior to our arrival, specifically Mehai, who was also very helpful.

Everyone on the staff seemed friendly and quick to say hello and offer help with anything. I wish I could recognize them all by name.

Our room was spotless every day. The breakfast service was delicious. It was a wonderful experience.  ",5,2023,09,05
145,Exceptional at Trafalgar Square ,"This hotel never lets you down, it’s great! Reception couldn’t be more helpful, the a Rooftop Bar is fantastic and breakfast great. On top of that you are in the middle of London at Trafalgar Square. What else can we say but excellent!",5,2023,09,03
145,"Fantastic hotel, phenomenal staff","Absolutely phenomenal and in large part to the service provided by Maddie. 

I highlight this because she was not only arguably the friendliest front desk staff I’ve ever met and was representative of the highest quality of service my wife and I have encountered. To the management: please promote her - nice hotels exist all over the place, staff like her do not and people like Maddie are the reason why we will stay again!

As a Hilton Diamond, I love staying at the curio collection hotels and this one is fantastic. From the charming restaurant to the chic rooms and well, the stunner of a location. 

5/5 starts. Cannot recommended enough. ",5,2023,09,03
145,Best hotel in London!,"Fantastic location walking distance to numerous attractions and the theater district.  The staff were always cheerful and accommodating.  Breakfast (buffet and made to order) was wonderful with a wide and varied selection. Rooms were clean and comfortable.  We were there for 4 nights and were treated like VIPs the entire stay.  The rooftop bar is a must, and guests have priority reservations during busy times.  I've been to London numerous times and this is far and away the best hotel there is.  easily a 5 star hotel.",5,2023,08,24

Location is superb, staff are incredibly attentive and helpful, restaurant and rooftop bar are fabulous! We arrived in the morning after an overnight flight and were accommodated with an early check-in and were very pleased with the comfort and space of our room. Enjoyed a wonderful brunch at the rooftop bar where food, drink and views were amazing.

145,Central location comfortable beds,"St. James Trafalgar hotel gave us a room on the 1st floor. Usually I find lower floors have less light but not this one. We had very comfortable two queen beds and loved our stay here! Service was impeccable, really good. Location was central and so easy to get to everything. Super-crowded but that is to be expected. There is construction going on outside but that didn't disturb us. The breakfast spread was quite good and so many options for hot food too. We loved our stay here! Highly recommend for a central location. Turndown service was offered. We didn't open our curtains since it was so close to the road, but the sheer curtains offered privacy and light. I would stay here again. If I had to nit-pick, it is the shower head which kept moving and water spilled outside. But the bathrooms was decently-sized.",4,2023,08,17

",5,2023,08,15
145,Best hotel in London,"Great hotel, great location but what truly made it worth it was the exceptional staff. I arrived to check in early having finished another leg of my trip and was meeting my husband here for what was supposed to be a 2 night stay. We were originally staying at another property but after issues there my first night decided to switch to the Trafaglar Square St James Hilton instead. I arrived way before check in, exhausted and I’m sure slightly smelly since the previous hotel had issues with the water and shower.

I was greeted in my exhausted state by the lovely Ingrid. Who like a fairy godmother made everything better. She listened to me vent about things that were truly not her fault like a trusted friend, expressed sympathy and then did her best to fix my morning. There wasn’t any rooms ready but she found one that was already vacant and after a quick call to housekeeping it was next up to be cleaned so I could get into it and shower!

She also told me where I could go to acquire some coffee and breakfast pastries since the hotel breakfast was done for the day. She gave us drink vouchers for the rooftop bar for later and then magically whisked away my baggage and I was off to find that cafe.

Within an hour Ingrid had our room ready, stocked with more coffee and extra waters and my bags were already in it.

The room itself was great, good bed, good shower pressure, and quiet. They also stock the fridge with waters and Coke daily which was nice. Breakfast was incredible, the best at any hotel in Paris, London, or Scotland that we experienced this trip.

Ingrid continued to greet us at the front and check in on our stay. We actually extended by another night because we were so happy there.

Although Ingrid was amazing truly all the staff was attentive and made the property go from good to great in our eyes.

We can’t wait to return to London on a future trip and see Ingrid again.

145,The Trafalgar St. James is a well-priced understated luxury hotel in a great location,"+ Beautifully appointed and super clean hotel in one of the best sightseeing locations in the city. 

+ Free drinks (water, soda, tea, coffee) and a few snacks in the room and to order throughout a stay.

+ Very friendly, happy, and helpful staff at front desk, restaurant, housekeeping, and concierge. 

+ Rooms are noise-insulated with thick windows and black-out curtains and well-designed with lots of cabinets, hooks, a super comfy bed with wonderful sheets.

+ Breakfast buffet plus made-to-order items are included in the ""breakfast included"" rates - great selection and good food. 

+The Rooftop has nice views, great cocktails, and good service but hard to get into without a booking - book well in advance. 

- The Rockwell restaurant's dinner menu selection, quality of food, and pricing could be better.",5,2023,08,09
145,Oasis In Trafalgar Square.,"Tucked away from the wonderful chaos of Trafalgar Square is The Trafalgar St. James. Perhaps the warmest, friendliest hotel in all of London. A kind, welcoming front desk. (shout out to Olena + Keshav + their Manager) An amazing breakfast in the beautifully colorful downstairs restaurant. We appreciated its convenience to everywhere, with always a helpful hand at the front door and super attentive concierge for questions and advise. We came for a Wedding. We left with great memories!!!  (All this coming from my wife and I who have lived in Manhattan the last 30+ years.) ",5,2023,08,08
145,Great staff!,"Very good stay. Great in room breakfast. Great location. Fantastically warm staff. 

Downside is the late night room service menu options are limited to pre-made sandwich and some olives. So, if you’re American and gluten intolerant, prepare to starve as you acclimate to the time change. 

Restaurant and bar stop serving at 10:30 and there’s not much open around the hotel, leaving not much to do at or close by at night.

Super walkable to everything and nice sized rooms. Felt secure and safe as the staff seemed to take note of everyone coming in and out and you can’t go to your room without scanning your room key. ",4,2023,08,08
145,"Great location, nice vibe and attentive staff.","Our family had a wonderful stay at the Trafalgar St. James. The location was great - easy to navigate the city from there, and many restaurants nearby. You can link up with a hop on hop off bus within a short walk. Many of the theaters are within walking distance.  We had two rooms, and I would highly recommend the Trafalgar Suite that has a sitting area. Tony warmly greeted us, and Mike took great care of us - providing recommendations and accommodating our requests.",5,2023,08,07
145,One Of The BEST!,"WOW. What a magnificent hotel! 
Everything that you read on here is true about this hotel! Stayed here for our silver wedding anniversary and the hotel really did make the experience one to never forget. Everyone from front door, reception, cleaning staff were extremely friendly.
Location is perfect, short walk to Charing Cross underground, or Embankment. Directly opposite Trafalgar Square. 
Rooms are exceptional, with comfy beds, pillows, great shower / bathroom and accessories in the room. 
Breakfast was wonderful and choices are buffet or from menu.
We had a drink at the rooftop bar and this is also a must.
Thank you to this hotel for making our trip so special. ",5,2023,08,07
145,Best in Central London,"Loved this hotel.  Location can’t be beat for convenience in Central London.  Staff is very friendly and helpful.  Rooms are very good size for London, great value for the price. The rooftop bar is great!  Stayed here four nights with my daughters.",5,2023,08,05
145," I think it was perfect!","We go to London, 3-4 times a year, a creature of habit, always stay in the same hotel, this time however we decided to try the Trafalgar St James, in one of the suites, and I have to say the entire experience was no less than fantastic.  The hotel is lovely/stunning, and all the staff we met were polite/happy/excellent.  It is undoubtedly the best hotel I have stayed in, the suite was just the best.  The Rooftop bar is a great experience and the Rockwell restaurant is also a lovely place to be and the food is exquisite, This hopefully will now become our regular place to stay in the future, the whole experience made us happy and relaxed.",5,2023,08,03
145,A great hotel in the middle of everthing,"We did a short trip to London as a family and we can highly recommend the Curio at Trafalgar Square. The beds a just perfect, we slept really well and I have to say that this hotel is really, really nice. The location is perfect as you can walk almost to everything in London. And if you have to take the tube, there is a station right across as well as the busses. The rooftop is just great, you have to take drink as the view is outstanding. The rooms are stylish furnished and is really clean. My kids and my husband appreciate it that the drinks got refilled really fast at the room. As a gold member we felt really welcomed. The breakfast is not big but you can order a la carte and my daughter got even glutenfree bred. Once again, I highly recommend the hotel. ",5,2023,08,03
145,Great stay,"We had a wonderful stay. I would like to thank Ingrida (the front desk clerk) she made our stay perfect.  Ingrida is so warm and welcoming, she takes the time to make sure everything is perfect.  She is exactly why we are loyal to Hilton. ",5,2023,07,31
145,Family trip,"Location was amazing and the staff were polite and nothing was too much. Great mini bar for coke and water that was free.
Comfy bed and was upgraded for free which allowed our rooms to be next to each other",5,2023,07,30
145,Nice Stay at the Trafalgar St James,"This is a lovely hotel situated in the equivalent of Times Square. Convenient to public transport but difficult to reach by taxi due to traffic congestion.

We had a lovely room, well appointed and large
For European standards. A true king sized bed and customary American amenities. Consequently many guests were American so that comes with typical American behavior.
The staff is welcoming and present, attentive and very helpful. We had an a/c leak in our room and they were up within 5 minutes to address and correct it.

Our very high room rate included breakfast which was great. We had the buffet which included typical English, American, and European options. There is a roof top bar which serves great cocktail with a 360 view if London.

If you are looking for an American style hotel this one will be perfect.",4,2023,07,30
145,"Central location, great amenities and wonderful staff","This hotel was a wonderful find.  I would normally disregard hotels in such a central area as I would expect them to be overpriced for what you get when you stay.  I decided to book as it suited our travel plans and I was so happy I did.  The hotel is well appointed.  The rooms are spacious.  The basement bar, the restaurant and the rooftop bar are all great locations with interesting and exciting ranges of food and drinks.  The staff were very attentive and very pleasant at every interaction.  We highly recommend and will stay here the next time we're in London.",5,2023,07,25
145,The place to stay,"Trafalgar St James is a perfect spot to base your stay in London. Located across the street from Trafalgar Square, you have everything at your fingertips. At the hotel the amenties have all you need, from drinks or a meal at the rooftop bar or in the Rockwell. The accomodations are excellent and very comfortable, especially after long day exploring the city. The place to stay!",5,2023,07,24
145,Impeccable Service all around ,"We stayed here for 8 nights. Located in Trafalgar Square, it is the perfect location to sightsee on foot. The service and high quality amenities really shine at this property. From check-in to check-out, The service was always impeccable. keshav at the front desk took care  of any concerns that arose.  The entire front desk and concierge staff looked after our every need. I wish I had gotten all their names because they all deserve praise. The restaurant staff and housekeeping all receive high marks. Good breakfast.‘Molton Brown bath products we will stay here again on our next visit to London.",5,2023,07,22
145,Great London Stsy,"St James Trafalgar is a very nice hotel with a great location. It is a short walk to a London tube station and Trafalgar Square is just across the street. Staff is very attentive and friendly. The hotel and our room was well maintained, clean and comfortable. The rooftop bar and ground floor restaurant were both great. I highly recommend it.",5,2023,07,21
145,Amazing last minute stay!,"We needed to find a place to stay in that location and the Trafalgar still had a room or two. We were welcomed by Kate (amazing!) and upgraded to a King. The next day we enjoyed a delightful lunch at the rooftop restaurant. Maria, the waitstaff there, was also amazing and offered to take our family photograph in the best spot. Hotel has an amazing location and great vibes.",5,2023,07,21
145,"Perfect Central Location , charming","I am an American who used to be an ex pat in London. This hotel was fantastic, centrally located and clean. Worth it all around. 5 stars. The staff was incredibly friendly and professional. Rooms are clean and gorgeous. Great soaps in shower.",5,2023,07,21
145,Truly a 5 star hotel!,"Although we have status with Marriott, we decided to stay somewhere new and LOVED it here so will certainly be back. The stylish and large rooms plus amazing service (Ingrid A front desk) made this a repeat hotel for sure! ",5,2023,07,21
145,Quick but lovely stay in London!,"Beautiful hotel and lovely staff!  I stayed here for 1 night prior to heading back home after a long 2.5 weeks for business.  It was a wonderful and comfortable place to come to before making the long trek home.  Clean, comfortable and centrally located - will definitely stay here again! ",5,2023,07,17
145,Central and perfect stay,"Well what can I say. I’ve been staying in hotels in london for many years. But this hotel tops it all. The location the rooms. But you know the best, it’s the team. I hope I remember the name correctly, Curtis.  I think he was reception manger. I was so tired and checked out of the metropole for being mistreated. I arrived at this hotel and they made up in the name of the Hilton group. I cannot thank the team enough. Even before the reception the guys at the door seen me 15-20 feet away and approached me to help me check in. I recommend this hotel big time. Go and see for yourself. And the room was just amazing.  When I’m in london I will be sure to stop by again or even say hi. Oh and the rooftop bar is another hidden gem. Thanks so much you made up for the metropole and made my stay so welcoming.  I thank you ",5,2023,07,17
145,"Lovely hotel, fantastic staff, terrific location","My husband and I had stayed previously at the Trafalgar St. James, when it was in the middle of renovation.  On this trip we returned to enjoy the results.
We choose this hotel because it has an unbeatable location for what we like to do:  theatre, favorite museums, Westminster, gorgeous parks, and wonderful restaurants are all within reasonable walking distance.
The rooms are very nicely done, comfortable, impeccably clean, and have more support for our devices than any other hotel in which we have stayed (outlets EVERYWHERE).  
The staff are superb.  Capable, well-informed, charming, and helpful.
The breakfast is offered in the Rockwell restaurant, which is very pretty with its new facelift.  It was great.
We also dined one night at the Rooftop and had a terrific time.  It overlooks the city and offers good libations, a casual menu, and as (as we expected) a lively crowd and happy atmosphere.",5,2023,07,14
145,Unbeatable Location and Excellent Accommodations,"If you're interested in being close to some of London's most famous landmarks, look no further!  The Trafalgar St. James is right on the corner of Trafalgar Square.  Short walks to St. James Park, Buckingham Palace, Big Ben, Westminster Abbey, and the London Eye will help you take in the sights in no time.  The Charing Cross tube station is in Trafalgar Square, and Embankment Station is also close, so getting around the city is easy. Be sure to visit the National Gallery, which is in Trafalgar Square.  For a first-time visit to London, this location is phenomenal. I'm not sure how another location could be better. 

Now for other great aspects: we stayed in the Family Room.  I was worried about small hotel rooms in London, but this didn't feel small at all.  The furnishings were very comfortable, and the room was bright with a view of Trafalgar Square. The bathroom was also spacious.  The Trafalgar St. James staff were very helpful and welcoming.  The only small ""areas for improvement"" were that we had to make a couple of reminders of the number or people in the room with regard to towels and other complimentary items. We visited the Rooftop Restaurant and did have a nice view of Trafalgar Square from there, but we were not crazy about the menu options. Nevertheless, this hotel would be an exceptional choice.  Treat yourself to a fabulous stay!",5,2023,07,10
145,"Central, clean, nice hotel","We had a nearly flawless experience at the hotel. The room was well appointed with shelves and space to set out our things. We appreciated the free daily water and Nespresso in the room. The bed was comfortable, and the hotel was very quiet—we barely heard other guests and our room was on the back side of the hotel. The only noise was the dumping of glass every morning at 7 into an outside dumpster in the ally. 

The hotels location is perfectly central for exploring London, and there is a roof bar with great views. Would definitely stay again!",5,2023,07,10
145,BUYER BEWARE: Trafalgar King Room Bait and Switch!!!,"I booked the Trafalgar King Room at the Trafalgar St. James. The photos of this room on the website all show large, front-facing, floor-to-ceiling windows. One of the pics shows what appears to be a Juliet balcony. 

When I checked in, the room I got did not have any large windows and faced the back of the building. I thought it must have been a mistake, as the room advertised on the website looked completely different from the room I was assigned.

I went downstairs and showed the manager the room on the website and a pic of the room she put me in. The night manager explained to me that my room was indeed a Trafalgar King room and that ""obviously"" some of the rooms face the back (didn't explain why there was one tiny window instead of two huge ones). This bothered me very much; of course I know that ""obviously"" some rooms face the back and have small windows, but those are typically cheaper rooms. Furthermore I booked a room advertised with huge front-facing windows and a Juliet balcony. I didn't get anything close to that!! So in my mind this was a BAIT and SWITCH. I very much wanted a room with a view and everything on the booking site let me to believe that I would get that. Otherwise I would have simply chosen another hotel.

The night manager put me in a slightly larger room with the same views. I was not satisfied with the replacement room. I tried again the next day to move into a front-facing room with large windows. The day manager said those rooms were not available. Later that day the night manager told me that she finally found the room pictured on the site (that at least it exists at the hotel) but that I wouldn't be able to have it since it was fully booked. 

Overall this was a very frustrating experience. I liked the hotel but I will not book it again, because there's a high probability of NOT getting a room that looks anything like the way it looks on the website. It's a shame, too. Because the hotel is great!",3,2023,07,06
145,Fabulous Service and Accommodations,"The staff at the hotel were fabulous.  They went above and beyond to assist us in any way that they could.  We needed some special arrangements to refrigerate some food items and special assistance in getting to our room.  Everyone was very accommodating and helpful with a smile.  Also,  the location was fantastic.  Thank you to the staff for a great trip to London!",5,2023,07,05
145,Trafalgar St. James London,"I had researched possible London hotels on line and this turned out to be the right choice.  We had paid in advance in order to achieve a nice discount, and this hotel met our high expectations.  The location is excellent, right across the street from Trafalgar Square, and very close to the Mall, at the end of which is Buckingham Palace.  One other very important factor is the hotel’s proximity to nearby Underground stations along the Bakerloo and Northern Lines.  The service here was also outstanding.  We had arrived mid-morning on our flight from the U.S., so this was way ahead of normal check-in time.  The hotel personnel, however, were very helpful and did not hesitate to hold our luggage while we toured the surrounding areas for most of the day.  When we returned to our room in the late-afternoon we found that they had already taken our luggage up to our room!  For the rest of our stay that week we found the housekeeping staff responded quickly and completely to our every request.  We also very much enjoyed the fact that this Hilton was not full of barking dogs as so many of the Hilton hotels in the U.S. have become.  I believe our room was the St. James king-size bed version which was an upgrade from the standard room.",5,2023,07,03
145,Loved the Hotel,"The hotel was clean and staff friendly and knowledgeable. Breakfast was awesome and the roof bar was amazing. The best thing about the hotel was the loacation.   The tube was just a few steps away and the square is across the street. Easy walking distance to the prime sites. 
",5,2023,07,02
145,What a great experience!!,"One of the nicest hotels I have ever stayed in. The staff was phenomenal, and the location is fantastic for tourist activities. Spent 4 nights in June before a cruise, and lucked into the trooping of the colour. What an experience. The rooftop bar and restaurant are not to be missed. Special mention to Toby Brown as he was wonderful helping clueless tourists with their questions. We will be back!!!!",5,2023,07,01
145,Excellent hotel,"Brand new, very well designed. Thoughtful in every aspect, intimate. Great service, great rooms. the best free restaurant of my life. This place over delivers. I would definitely stay here again. Best Hilton ever! ",5,2023,06,30
145,Cubs-Cardinals Stay -5 night stay.,"We had an incredible time at this hotel. It is in the middle of everything and the staff was amazing! If you stay there and want to go to the rooftop bar, please mention you are a hotel guest--they will get you in and it is worth the trip! 
The room and bathroom were spacious for London and well equipped!
Would love to stay again! ",5,2023,06,27
145,Service and Location are the best!,"This hotel thrives on excellent service!  From the timely communication concerning facilities before we came to London, to the helpfulness of staff at the front desk, and to the help with luggage, taxis, and support, we were given outstanding service.  We loved this hotel!  Our double queen room, with the good beds, clean rooms, hot showers, free mini-bar and water, good Wi-Fi, and even the welcome fruit basket, was the best!  We loved the delicious breakfast and their service each morning, and we also enjoyed the other two restaurants on site.  The location at Trafalgar Square was convenient and a good place for history buffs like us. I started to keep a list of some of the helpful staff members, but soon realized that all personnel should be on the list!  Great hotel!  Great location!  Great service!!",5,2023,06,23
145,best hotel for stay,"Best hotel I have ever stayed in. Whole team who welcomed us were great, never felt this welcomed in a hotel. great location. staff at reception is super helpful & nice. Definitely going to stay here again.",5,2023,06,22
145,Exactly what we were hoping for!,"Excellent in every way. A wonderful respite each evening after a night on the town. Great location and very high quality feel! 

Enjoyed breakfast each morning and a nice afternoon on the rooftop bar as well. ",5,2023,06,21
145,Perfect stay!,"I recently returned to the Trafalgar St James hotel to celebrate my birthday, once again I wasn’t disappointed. A friendly greeting from the concierge also a  warm welcome from the staff who checked us in. The hotel has a chic interior which i absolutely love! The food was delicious and the rooftop bar is definitely worth a visit with views across Trafalgar Square and beyond. Ideally situated for those who want to explore London while also having all the major attractions on your doorstep. A final thank you to all the staff, an absolute credit to the hotel, we will definitely be returning!!",5,2023,06,20
145,Brilliant experience- best in London,"Amazing experience, really enjoyed everything that this hotel can offer - service is great as always, front of house team is amazing and location is great - highly recommended while visiting London. Will be back!!",5,2023,06,19
145,Stay someplace else,"We stayed there for 3 nights and 4 days.  The hotel was very nice but we stayed there to go to the rooftop bar each night for cocktails before heading out, it had private functions 2 nights in a row, and closed early on Sunday.  They wouldn’t even let us up 90 minutes before they said the private function started.  

The restaurant on ground floor for breakfast was great, as were the bartenders.

The biggest issue was the noise from outside.  The windows while not opening let a lot of noise in.  I would stay at a Hampton Inn before staying here, and when i complained they said i the Curio collection way, that is the way it is.  As I stay at Hiltons often, as well as Curio colllection beans of Hiltons, this was not up to par.",1,2023,06,19
145,Best Hotel in London,"I am a long-time Hilton Diamond (also a Lifetime Titanium with Marriott), probably approaching 1000 nights with Hilton. Many stays in Europe approximately 25 one-to-two week stays in London. The Trafalgar St. James is now at the top of my list for London hotels, surpassing even the Savoy, the Connaught, Claridges and the Lanesborough in virtually every category.

SERVICE: This starts with Kurtis and Toby, the Day Managers during our stay.  Both were consummate professionals, anticipating our needs even before we asked, while also being extremely welcoming and friendly.  I believe that every single time we passed by the front desk, they proactively asked if there was anything they could do for us!!!  And they accommodated all our desires. The entire staff, from Toby and Kurtis, to the staff in the Rockwell restaurant, the maids and the concierge service - all go out of their way to be friendly, kind and attentive.  Truly the most accommodating and attentive management and staff that I have run across in my hundreds of hotel stays 

LOCATION: Perhaps the best in London.  Brief walks to Parliament , Westminster; Covent Gardens, Piccadilly, and many excellent restaurants.  The National Gallery is across the street, as is Trafalgar Square.

ROOMS - Large and updated, with excellent furnishings and very comfortable beds with plush linens.  Excellent blackout drapes and despite being right on Trafalgar Square, there is zero discernible noise - zero.

BATHROOMS: Large with large showers, plush towels, luxury toiletries, and very clean.

BREAKFAST: A very extensive buffet with top-tier selections, and Diamonds could add an additional cooked to order item from the kitchen, such as omelettes, Eggs Benedict, Benedict Royale, and several others.  The restaurant staff is very friendly and renders excellent service.

Concierge – Knowledgeable and they go out of their way to be thorough in every regard.

Cleanliness - perfect grade.

EXTRAS: The water, sodas, tea,  cookies, etc in the minibar are all complimentary - what a rare benefit these days!

AND THE ROOFTOP BAR:  Has one of the nicer views in London - overlooks Trafalgar, and good views of Big Ben, the London Eye and much more as well.  Excellent cocktails, good food, and efficient and friendly waiters.  Great place to unwind and to take photos,  Be sure to make reservations.

BOTTOM LINE:  Stay here if you can!!!  As I said, The Trafalgar is on a par with the very best in London - better than Claridges and others with hefty reputations.  My wife and I will stay here every time we come to London - I've stayed at the best, and this is better (maybe tied with the Savoy and The Lanesborough, but at a more reasonable price!).  Enjoy!

145,Just what we needed,"We arrived after taking the redeye to London. We were all tired and ready for bed. We were greeted by some of the kindest hotel clerks and concierge. We found the rooms to be comfortable, spacious and air condition was cold . Hotel is conveniently located near several pubs. Perfect stay!! Special mention to Kate at the front desk!",5,2023,06,17
145,Great stay at The Trafalgar St. James!,"Our eight night stay at the St. James Trafalgar was nothing short of outstanding. The location is perfect, the entire staff more than accommodating and the hotel was immaculate. 

Maddie at the Front Desk was welcoming and friendly
from the minute we arrived.  She was able to arrange an early check-in, which was much appreciated after an overnight flight from the US. Throughout our stay, she would ask about our plans  and would follow-up by specifically asking how we enjoyed each sight when we returned. Such personalized kindness is not typical in a hotel in a major city.

Housekeeping cleaned our room beautifully, which complemented our perfect stay.

The bell staff was exceptional as well. They always wished us a good day before touring and warmly welcomed us back when we returned. 

The included breakfast exceeded our expectations. 
Every breakfast item you can think of was at the buffet and we were also offered the option to order from the menu. The servers were friendly, always greeting us with a pleasant “Good Morning” and seemed happy to see us every day. 

We will always stay at the St. James Trafalgar when we return to London. If we could give the hotel and staff 10 stars, we absolutely would. 

",5,2023,06,17
145,Service very questionable,"Having arrived with my boss for a late minute change to his schedule, we booked into this hotel.  Having booked him a trafalgar queen room and phoned to confirm his requirements, we turned up to be given a room clearly not as described on the booking.  

The service I witnessed from your manager on duty was simply disgraceful.  Even thou I also asked if we could cancel free of charge to rebook elsewhere, your manager “rolled his eyes” and said no.  

If anyone is booking for business, I’d think twice!",1,2023,06,16
145,Worst manager ever!,"Last minute business reservation. I called hotel to ask for extra pillows in room and that wasn’t honoured. After check in, I was given an accessible room and I had booked a Trafalgar queen room.  I was told by reception I’d be facing Trafalgar Square. When I spoke to the deputy front of house manager, Tommy, he told me I had got what I booked.  Rolled his eyes and complete disgrace.  

Worst service",2,2023,06,15
145,Six Stars out of Five,"Picky traveler here. Having stayed at a number of 5  star hotels in London, like the Savoy and the Connaught, I can honestly say that the Trafalgar St James is just as good if not better. The staff is exceptional- kind and helpful at all times.  The Concierge (multiple gentleman) were so helpful.  The front desk staff bends over backwards to please. The rooms are very well appointed, quiet and comfortable.  Breakfast is excellent and included if u r a Diamond member- worth every penny. No nickel and diming about in room refreshments- aren’t u sick of having to pay $8 for a lousy bottle of water?  Not here! Gratis water and Coke. What’s not to love?!  The Rooftop bar/restaurant is wonderful- food is darn good, too. Great place for a photo. It’s location is a perfect jumping off point - Trafalgar Square. I’d give the St James a 6 if Trip Advisor would let me. Thank you, St James staff. You r the best. P.S.  A special shout out to Curtis the Miracle Worker.",5,2023,06,13
145,This may be the best Curio Collection hotel we stayed,"Everything about this hotel has exceeded our expectations. The location is perfect, rooms are very comfortable and modern. Rooftop bar is amazing. Breakfast was great. Everything you needed to go sightseeing is walking distance from the hotel",5,2023,06,10
145,Stayed for 23 Years.....,"I have stayed in this hotel for 23 years, and it goes from strength to strength. The service, the welcome and the building just get better with age. Room 105 is the best suite to stay in London overlooking Trafalgar Square and reasonably priced. ",5,2023,06,10
145,Secret suites,The hotel was ideally placed near Trafalgar Square about 25 minutes walk from Waterloo train station. The hotel layout has a modest footprint but stretches 6 vertical floors. The rooftop bar is quite funky but I felt a bit lonely as a solo traveller sitting at a table on my own. The absolute highlight for me was the room.  I was lucky enough to stay in a suite (which aren’t generally listed on their website) which was out of this world. The suites was like something out  of a movie. Perfect for entertaining. ,5,2023,06,10
145,Excellent hotel,"It’s my third time in the hotel, room as always, very hospitality. Very friendly, clean and big .great location and stuff was excellent
Although it is not cheap, it worth the amount we pay.
Breakfast was excellent, and the staff was hospitality.",5,2023,06,07
145,Wonderful Hotel and Staff,"From a facility standpoint there was nothing missing.  Room was good size, clean and well furnished.  And located in the heart of the city at Trafalgar Square. Staff took care to be certain our room was ready for our return at the end of each day visiting the city.
Regarding staff, they could not be more accommodating.  I had the misfortune of winding up in the hospital for several days one day after arrival that threw all our plans out the window including length of stay.  
The hotel staff made arrangements for us to keep our room an additional number of days as well as other members of our party in separate rooms.
A big shoutout to Kurtis Huggins, manager on duty the day I was released from the hospital.  He delivered a special gift to our room as well as a kind and thoughtful personal note.
All above and beyond anything one should expect.  My regret is that I failed to remember the names of so many others on staff that treated us with such kindness and respect.

Thanks to all the professionals at The Trafalgar St James for making our visit to London so special. 

Richard Franklin",5,2023,06,05
145,Excellent in every way,"Everything was wonderful, front desk very helpful and nice, breakfast was spectacular, the room was very big and comfortable, the hotel very well located.

Definitely will come back to this hotel whenever I have to visit London again.
",5,2023,06,04
145,Lovely location ,I really like this hotel because of its location. It’s easy to walk to many sites of interest. The rooms are clean and comfortable. The staff is friendly and helpful. The food options… well there really isn’t many and that’s a huge issue for me.,4,2023,06,03
145,Stylish and well located hotel.  Loved it!,"Super cool and hip hotel brilliantly located right at Trafalgar Square.  Our 4th floor St. James Family King room was spacious, spotless and overlooked the Canadian Embassy.  We heard very little street noise.  Our bed was dreamy comfortable and the bed and bath linens were top notch (towels were SO fluffy and soft!). The overall décor is stylish and modern.  Absolutely LOVED the huge art photo of Mick Jagger above the bed.  My husband is convinced it’s the reason I selected this hotel.  He may not be wrong.  Loved all the cool and funky artwork throughout the hotel.  The bathroom was nice size with a wonderful soaking tub but the rather smallish shower (think phone booth with just a few extra inches) was a little challenging for my tall guy.  Nice bath products.  Appropriate amount of storage space.  Water pressure and Wifi were strong.  The overall lighting in the room was odd.  The switch for the bathroom was 7 ft away from the bathroom in the entryway?  There were no outlets in the bathroom AT ALL for hair appliances and such.  Must utilize the little wall-desk, mirror and ottoman for hair-dryer and flat-iron action.  Room is precisely as pictured on their website.  Housekeeping was spot on as our room was perfectly prepared upon our arrival and perfectly maintained throughout our stay.  We left a note requesting a few specifics and voila!  They took care of our requests every single day...  The complimentary water and bottled cokes were a rare and appreciated amenity.  Rockstar black-out drapes.  The hotel is a completely cashless property.  Had to change a bill elsewhere in order to tip housekeeping.  

Every staff member we encountered were welcoming and helpful.  We had the hotel arrange our airport transfers prior to arrival which was a great move as they were executed perfectly for ~ £100 each way.  Wonderful concierge.  Never steered us wrong!  The attached restaurant “Rockwell” was visually beautiful with lovely and unique craft cocktails and a nice menu.  Excellent service as well.  The Rooftop has stunning city views.  A nice place for a cocktail at night to enjoy the illuminated city.  It gets crowded and it’s a small space but definitely worth a look.

Bottom line: Fantastic hotel!  Perfect for an optimum London experience.  Highly recommend. 

P.s.  We made advance dinner reservations for the original Ivy on West street; superb experience.  The walk back to the hotel with all things illuminated was just magical.   We also enjoyed Walkers of Whitehall Pub and Restaurant tucked in a quiet ally just a very short walking distance from the hotel.

So much better than last visit a few years ago. Hotel service impeccable from arrival to the point of leaving.
Faith has been restored and look forward to returning.
Area is perfect for everything and the room was clean with great facilities.
But staff made this a pleasure so well done!",5,2023,05,30
145,Great hotel in a great location.,An amazing hotel in the heart of London. Great location for sightseeing and close to the tube stations. Concierge Tom was very helpful with dinner reservations. The rest of the staff were very friendly and attentive.,5,2023,05,29
145,Great stay in heart of london,"Really lovely room, great location and really friendly staff - ticked all the boxes. Would be nice if cheaper but hotel prices in London are crazy now! 

That said it really was a lovely place for a night and late morning lie in!",5,2023,05,28
145,Great Hotel; Great Staff; No Charge for in room Treats!,"The Trafalgar St. James is a wonderful hotel, not just because of its location, but because of the welcoming staff and accommodations. We would definitely stay at this hotel again when in London. The staff helped with luggage at curb side, gave us directions, and were thoughtful about our dining location preferences at the hotel. The room was beautiful, beds really comfy, and EVERYTHING in the room was complimentary. That means no nickel and diming or large charges for the water, sodas, tea, coffee, cookies, etc. left in the room. What a delight to crack open a soda or have tea before snuggling into bed knowing these treats were our to enjoy as part of the accommodations.",5,2023,05,27
145,Perfect location for a perfect vacation,The Saint James Trafalgar is perfectly situated in the center of the city.  Major points of interest are within a few steps and walking distance.  The staff is pleasant and professional.  Having stayed in London previously at different hotel I will undoubtedly stay here next time I travel across the pond.  Cannot say enough about the staff and property.  The rooftop bar and lounge is wonderful to sit and enjoy a cocktail and small plates while overlooking Trafalgar Square.  ,5,2023,05,26
145,False Advertisement,We booked a room with two large windows but upon check-in we got a smaller room with just one window. Front desk told us there is not guarantee customer will get the room shown on the web site. This doesn't make sense to us. We understand there is no guarantee on the outside view of the room but interior should match what was advertised on the web site. False advertisement ,2,2023,05,25
145,High quality stay with a boutique feel,"The Trafalgar is a small, friendly hotel. The staff are very nice and happy to help in any way. The rooms are comfortable, very neat and tidy, and have high-quality design elements. We were greeted with a wonderful welcome package and made to feel at home. Breakfast is fantastic in the beautiful restaurant, great service there as well.",5,2023,05,25
145,Thank you Nelson!,Wonderful stay at the Trafalger. Nelson at the front desk was very helpful and ensured we had a great stay on our Honeymoon.  Our room had an incredible view of the square and the room was beautiful. Thank you!,5,2023,05,23
145,"Luxurious, amenities, great location, great service.","Stayed here May 2023. Wonderful, clean hotel. Rooms updated and nespresso, beverages complimentary. Thick robes and slippers. Staff was very responsive with any needs and requests. Location was perfect with endless  restaurants and shops in walking distance.",5,2023,05,22
145,You won’t regret staying at Trafalgar Square Hilton,"Due to train strike, I had to alter plans and Trafalgar Square Hilton had availability and I got lucky. What a beautiful hotel with an attentive staff, clean, newer bathroom and great shower (best shower pressure I think I’ve ever had!) I moved to the Waldorf next for my regular reservation and it didn’t compare sadly! This hotel blew away the Waldorf in comfort and updated rooms. This is a hidden gem!! 

If you have your tix with Viator or GetYourGuide leaving from Victoria Bus terminal-don’t let this distance scare you. Temple tube entrance is around the bend in a 5-7 minute walk and 4 stops later to Victoria. It was super easy to get to my tours.",5,2023,05,19
145,"Great service, excellent location","Great service, excellent location, breakfast is delicious; very clean and comfortable room; close to theater. Very kind to provide surprise gift for gold Hilton members. We really enjoyed to stay there .",5,2023,05,15
145,"Absolutely stellar service, and a great location!!","We stayed here for five days over the height of the coronation weekend, and weren't expecting much due to how busy London would be, but boy were we surprised.
First, the location of this hotel is amazing.  For purposes of coronation the hotel is literally at Trafalgar Square so to view the processions we only had to walk 100m out of the front door.  For non coronation related events, the hotel was quick walking distance to most sites and less than a 10 minute walk to Leicester Square, Picadilly, theatre district.  Public transportation is made easier with bus and tube stops directly out front of the hotel.

As a diamond member, we had access to free breakfast which was phenomenal. The buffet had a great variety of  foods that would fit various preferences and dietary restrictions and the staff were very attentive.  The rooftop bar, which we only made it o once was actually reasonable priced and the view is just spectacular.

The room was a standard queen, which I was concerned about pre-stay, but the room was acutally decent size and the bathroom was actually large. The minibar with daily restocking of water and soft drinks was a nice touch.

Finally, the fact that the staff during this stay was so attentive to all customers in the hotel, especially given that this hotel was housing a number of VIP guests from other countires and their associated security details, which required sometimes closing off the main entrance and funneling guests through the restaurant.  At all times, the staff made us feel as if we were just as important as the King's VIP visitors.  

Would definitely recommend this hotel for a London tourist stay.   I am curious to revisit when there is not a special event going on, becuase if the service was this good during one of their busiest times, it must be off the chart during a normal stay.

",5,2023,05,15
145,Great hotel with superb location,"Hotel location couldn’t have been better! Opposite Trafalgar Square and so close to many London attractions. Tube stop is steps from the hotel and within walking distance of Regent Street, Covent Gardens, Piccadilly Circus and so much more.Spacious, comfortable rooms…and the rooftop restaurant is a must! Food, drinks and atmosphere were amazing! I will definitely stay here again. ",5,2023,05,14
145,Great time at Trafalgar,"They made us feel so welcome. I had ordered floral arrangements to be in our room at check in, and they were beautiful. Great attention to detail, and the staff was so friendly and accommodating. Great location as well. We were able to see most sites just by walking.",5,2023,05,13
145,Great hotel and very friendly staff. ,"The hotel is amazing, the breakfast is really good and the rooms are really clean, cozy and comfy! Beds are very comfortable too. The roof top restaurant is really good and the view is spectacular. The location is great, right by the Trafalgar Square, and it’s close to the London eye, the Big Ben and so many restaurants and pubs.  The staff is very friendly and helpful. Michal has been great, friendly and very helpful. Great stay. ",5,2023,05,09
145,Amazing,"Absolutely amazing. We came with my husband for his birthday and stay was impeccable, food delicious and service outstanding. Overall very chilled vibe and I love this 5* service with personality thing. People just great all over the place. Highly recommended!",5,2023,05,05
145,Delightful stay,"Stayed here for a double celebration. 
Start to finish we had a blast. Friendly and knowledgeable staff, decor was fabulous. Our room (107) was delightful.  Only downside was, it was a flying visit and one night was nowhere near long enough.
We will be back again very soon.",5,2023,04,28
145,"Wonderful London hotel, centrally located, excellent breakfast","We recently visited London with our two teenage boys and could not have been happier about our stay at the Trafalgar St. James.  The hotel is in a great location, within walking distance to many sights and two different tube lines.  The mattress and pillows were super comfortable - unless you prefer yours firm, this is the best I have found anywhere!  Staff was helpful and friendly and made good dinner suggestions.  We were lucky enough that breakfast was included in our rate.  There was a good selection of warm and cold food, and the best coffee I have ever had by far outside my home (bold, not the diluted stuff you typically get elsewhere).  We had drinks at the same restaurant one evening, which were inventive but seemed pricey for what you get.  A simple mini-bar was included in our rate, what a nice surprise.  One side note: someone with mobility challenges should ask if the hotel has rooms that are more easily accessible because the bathroom may otherwise be difficult to maneuver (very small shower in keeping with European practice, and very high step for the bath).  However, overall I could not recommend it enough!",5,2023,04,26
145,"Great location, great hotel, great breakfast","The Trafalgar St James is a stylish, welcoming and quirky hotel right in the heart of London. The hotel is located within walking distance of key attractions and is just moments from the theatre district, National Gallery and Whitehall. Situated right on Trafalgar Square, the entrance to the Underground is just across the road. The hotel is well appointed in a style that incorporates a balance of heritage features and contemporary art and eccentric design. Start your day with a wonderful combination of buffet and al a carte breakfast in the stylish Rockwell lounge. If you are after a place to stay that is not only centrally located, but that has a bit of personality, the Trafalgar St James will be a fun, stylish and memorable choice.",5,2023,04,24
145,Family stay,"We recently completed our five night stay. The hotel was accommodating and put us in connecting rooms as we were traveling with teenagers. I emailed the property ahead of time and am a Diamond member but communication was flawless. Highly recommend and the breakfast was very robust (eggs, bacon, fruits) everyday. Location can’t be beat and not noisy for being close to everything.",5,2023,04,21
145,Great location to stay with outstanding service. ,"Excellent service, Great central location, and fully agree with others that the breakfast is really good.  The front desk handled any question with ease and set up whatever we needed.  Great suggestions and easy to work with. ",5,2023,04,19
145,"Five-star location near the PM, the King, Piccadilly and the Abbey.","I wish I had stayed there longer. The views here are limited but it's a five-star location: Close to Trafalgar; St. James Palace; Buckingham; Parliament; 10 Downing; and Westminster Abbey. Comfort at The Trafalgar St. James, a Hilton-Curio brand, is first class. They provide free water, Coke. Honestly, if I lived in London and had millions of pounds, I would live there. The beds were awesome.

I was so impressed I told my friends in Washington, D.C., and New York City to stay at St. James, as it is a brief walk to Trafalgar, Parliament, Westminster Abbey, Churchill's bunker, 10 Downing, the Royal Auto Club, the Churchill war museum, Piccadilly, Trafalgar, etc. And plenty of restaurants. Housekeeping made everything clean and crisp and also soft and well stocked. And the housekeeping staff, whose service I found important and thorough.

Eating at the in-house eatery, the Rockwell, across from Canada House (I am originally Canadian), was quite the relaxing experience. The bacon and sausages -- English bacon, a slightly inferior version of streaky American bacon (ha) -- was great! There is also a bar atop the hotel with superb views. See my pix.",5,2023,04,19
145,One of the best London has ,"One of the best hotels I've ever stayed at! Location is right at Trafalgar Sq. Convenient walking access to many attractions including Covent Garden and Buckingham palace is less than a mile away! Toby, a quintessentially British assistant manager, who checked us in is a delight !  One of the staff at the Rockwell restaurant actually ran out and gave my daughter her umbrella when we had just left the hotel to pick up some sandwiches at the local Tesco. Poor guy didnt realize we were guests there but he went out of his way to return her unicorn umbrella! The service is fantastic! Rooms are spacious for London standards. The pic I added is from their gorgeous rooftop bar/restaurant!",5,2023,04,18
145,Fantastic hotel for everyone!,"Love, love, love this hotel. It is on the expensive side but the check in and rooms are a dream. A very good size and so relaxed. Complementary water and Coke/Diet Coke in the fridge. It was also a special occasion so they put champagne and cake in the room. It was so nice. As you enter or leave the hotel the staff acknowledge you and always greet you.

The breakfast is beautiful. Freshly squeezed orange juice, beautiful pots of tea and a very nice buffet style breakfast. There is also a La carte egg  options. I can’t say how good the staff are in this hotel. 

Can’t wait to return!",5,2023,04,16
145,"A family friendly, accommodating hotel in a fabulous location ","Many thanks for a wonderful stay for my Mother's Birthday. She was thrilled with the lemon tart, champagne and balloons so thank you for facilitating all of that. 
Thank you also for making travelling with two young children as easy as possible! We will definitely be back in future.  ",5,2023,04,13
145,Great Business Stay,Fabulous hotel and very attentive staff. I stayed a few days for a business trip and can honestly say everything was catered for to a very high standard. The room was spacious and extremely comfortable and the breakfast was excellent. I will definitely be returning in the near future.,5,2023,04,13
145,Excellent but not inexpensive,"Super staff and service as well as location. Price  was high ,specially for drinks but overall, after 5 days I was feeling at home and will return.The only disappointment was the limited menu in the restaurant for dinner on Sunday (perhaps because it was Easter)",5,2023,04,12
145,Wonderful Location ,"We arrived before check in and the manager at the front desk said that they have a room available and we could check in early. After a long flight we were every happy to except. When we got to the room we were under whelmed. It was on the second floor and faces another building. It was also extremely loud as there was construction. The room was small and the bathroom smelled bad. It was certainly not up to the 5star accommodations that I was expecting. Had a horrible night rest as the bed was terribly uncomfortable and the noise was none stop. I truly believe they should use that room for supplies as there is nothing enjoyable about it.
 The next morning I complained and asked to be moved. They were able to accommodate me for an additional cost per night. The new room was nice, comfortable and had a partial view of Trafalgar Square. I was under whelmed by the staff. They were fine but seemed to knuckle and Dime you a bit. The roof bar was great and the breakfast was very delicious although it was not included. I loved the location ",4,2023,04,10
145,Luxury and comfort!,"Great hotel, staff couldn't have been more helpful and friendly. Great room, large and airy with a lovely, well stocked bathroom. Great value for the location. Everywhere was clean, well decorated & maintained - and smelled beautiful. ",5,2023,04,10
145,The Trafalgar St. James London,"Very nice hotel with a good central location for everything we did. 
The rooftop bar is very nice with great views; heaters and blankets.  
Jurate was the girl that checked us in and she was very accommodating; very friendly and very helpful with getting us checked in and all the questions we had!  ",5,2023,04,04
145,Excellent Hotel!,"Beautiful hotel in the best part of London. Perfect for theatre goers. The room was superb with everything you could possibly want. The staff were excellent catering for all our needs. Our bed was so comfortable I had an incredible nights sleep, I slept for 10 hours which is unheard of, I’m normally 5-6 hours! The rooftop bar is incredible with unrivalled views of London. We checked out at midday and treated ourselves to a Bloody Mary in the cocktail bar which was perfect. I’ll definitely use this hotel again. Thank you for a memorable experience.",5,2023,04,03
145,A Wonderful Stay!,This hotel is amazing! The team is very accommodating and make it a home away from home. The rooms are great and spacious and the hotel is in a great central location to lots of great things to do! We will definitely stay here again when we come back to London. Highly recommend!,5,2023,03,26
145,Excellent value for money,Had the most amazing Sunday roast with my friends - I was pleasantly surprised that the prices were very reasonable for what was a high end roast in a gorgeous 5 star hotel restaurant setting!! Will definitely bring all my friends and family here moving forward because it’s an excellent value for money. Thank You! ,5,2023,03,23
145,"Beautiful Hotel, Wonderful Staff, Impeccable Service","The Trafalgar St. James is a wonderful hotel, complete with stylish interiors, spotless rooms, and incredibly comfortable beds.  I found the hotel staff to be extremely welcoming and helpful, especially the concierge, Adrian, who helped me navigate a tricky airport transfer during the rail strike when cars were hard to come by.  The location is superb.  I will definitely stay here again on my next trip to London.",5,2023,03,21
145,"Excellent Service, Great Location!!!","I visited this hotel with my family for a long weekend in London after a cruise.  From the minute we arrived, the staff was friendly and accommodating.  I had questions on local restaurants and things to do and the concierge did a great job of providing suggestions and advice.  I would highly recommend this hotel to anyone coming to visit London.",5,2023,03,21
145,One of the better Hilton’s in London,"I was looking at the Biltmore and the Waldorf but decided to stay at the Trafalgar as they have bigger rooms than the Biltmore and the Waldorf looks like it is in desperate need of an upgrade. 

Everyone was very polite and helpful apart from one staff member, more on that later. I was upgraded to a Suite on arrival but requested a toom with two beds instead which was granted. The Nelson double room is very spacious and modern. It faintly smelled of mothballs whenever you entered the room and the smell then quickly disappeared. We noticed that one of the beds was sagged in the middle and this was very quickly resolved by the maintenance team and was not an issue for us at all. The only reason i mention it in my review is because Alejandra apologised a thousand times for this “inconvenience” and even send us Macaroons and drinks to the room as an apology. During checkout, Alejandra apologised again and made sure our stay was perfect. There was a key card under the bed which was covered with dust as was the carpet under the bed. Cleanliness regarding this could obviously be better as dust can trigger allergies. 

The service of the staff at Trafalgar is above that of all other Hilton properties in London and certainly a step above from general hospitality service in Europe. I would give the service at Trafalgar a 9 based on European standards and a 7 based on Middle-Eastern and Asian standards. 

Breakfast was so highly rated in many reviews of this hotel which also influenced my choice, i was expecting an absolute feast. Unfortunately, breakfast was quite disappointing for us. Staff was great apart from someone who i can only describe as a North-African young woman with shoulder length curls who did not want to give us one of the three empty tables available in the Breakfast room with only 40 minutes available for Breakfast as she was keeping those for families of 7. This is rather absurd and we ended up taking one of the tables anyway as i wasn’t going to sit where she suggested which was away from everyone else. Breakfast in any hotel, especially 5* is always based on first come, first serve. You can’t deny your guest seating space at breakfast as if you were running a dinner service. 

Vegan options are very, very limited. Fruit selection is even more basic than what you can get at any supermarket in London. There was only Cantaloupe, Watermelon and Pineapple. There were Apples and Bananas for grabs but that is still not enough. Pastries are miniatures which is really shameful for a breakfast buffet. Only sausages available were Pork, no vegan and no Chicken so unfortunately no sausages for me. It’s basically a full English and that’s it. You could order A-La-Carte but that wasn’t special either. We had Amex Platinum credit so we used that for one of the dishes which was not special for the £15 asking price. Room service was basic as well. Food arrived with a very friendly staff member but it was slightly cold. 

All in all it’s a good hotel for London standards but the breakfast is a joke.",4,2023,03,20
145,"Wonderful Hotel, Wonderful Staff, The Best Location","We found the The Trafalgar St. James to be a wonderful place to say.  The staff was very welcoming and gracious.  The room was large, clean, modern, and comfortable.  The location at the City Center made it convenient to go sightseeing.  During the week we stayed, there was a Underground Strike, a parade that shut down many streets, and several protests in the Square.  The Trafalgar St. James communicated with us several weeks before to inform us of these events, and even helped with arranging transportation to the airport so that we were not inconvenienced.  I highly recommend staying here for anyone wanting to visit London.",5,2023,03,18
145,Excellent location for everything in London,"Fantastic hotel in a great location for touring London. The room was very spacious by big city standards. Had a big photo of Mick Jagger above our bed. The folks at check-in could not have been more helpful. Got us coffees and got us a reservation for a drink up on the rooftop bar for the next night - we had been unable to make a reservation for that online because we did not want to eat. The view was great up there! Our room overlooked Trafalgar Square and the National Gallery and the hotel is right next to the Admiralty Arch leading to the Mall. There was a great Cafe Nero on the next block and may pubs, including the Red Lion around the corner on the way to Parliament, 10 Downing St, Churchill War Rooms and Westminster Abbey. All were within a 5-10 minute walk. At night we walked to Leicester Sq, Bloomsbury, Piccadilly Square and the Strand for dinners and theater. My husband did the hotel breakfast buffet one morning and said it was really good. Highly recommend!",5,2023,03,15
145,"A real gem, fantastic location","Absolutely LOVED my stay in London. This hotel is in a great location. Very safe neighborhood and as busy as the area, the rooms are very quiet. Favorite part of the hotel was the rooftop bar. It gets busy but after a few days you become a regular and the staff will find you a spot to enjoy a cocktail. Rooms are large and   clean. Really enjoyed the breakfast with wonderful service. Walking distance to all major attractions. Amazing stay!",5,2023,03,15
145,"Awesome hotel, awesome location! Stay here when you come to London!","As Hilton Diamond members we stay a lot of places. Have been to London multiple times but never stayed at St James Trafalgar Square, came this time after reading trip advisor reviews! It was the most lovely hotel!!! The location is outstanding. We walked to many places (restaurants and shopping) and Tube was super easy to get around. The staff was fabulous everywhere. Rooms clean. I loved they had a queen room for our family of four….we had plenty of space. We got fresh towels every day, knocks on the door for turn down service. The kids (14/16) even got little goodie bags at checkin. Finally they have a restaurant in the hotel which was perfect for breakfast everyday, and desserts/drinks everynite. Would highly recommend to everyone and for sure will stay again next time in town!",5,2023,03,14
145,The Rooftop makes the Trafalgar St. James a gem,"The Trafalgar St. James has a five-star location in the heart of London within walking distance of Covent Garden and the West End. The hotel has a classic London feel with a modern interior. The rooms are well-appointed and make you feel like you are in London while being quiet and comfortable despite the central location.

At the price point, the hotel is excellent. While we did experience an instance of slow service, the bars and restaurants more than made up for it with atmosphere and value (after all our breakfast was free).

If you are looking for a place centrally located in London near active nightlife and theatre areas, I’d highly recommend the Trafalgar St. James. Especially, If you can find availability on the low end of the points rate.",5,2023,03,08
145,Amazing,"Amazing staying! Thanks to Elena from the reception!
The hotel very beautiful and the breakfast is amazing! Good wifi too and we left the last day our luggage in the luggage room until the flight in the evening!",5,2023,03,08
145,Perfect hotel for our London visit,"My wife and I just enjoyed a four night stay at the Trafalgur St. James Hotel. It was splendid. We arrived early morning on a red eye flight and we were greeted by three members of the hotel staff right outside the front door.  They welcomed us, grabbed our luggage and introduced us to the front desk. Here we met Maggie who told us that our room was not yet available (it was 10am) but she would push to get it ready quickly. She called me one hour later with great news - the room was ready!  The hotel is clean, safe, and perhaps in the best location in all of London. We walked to Buckingham Palace, the National Gallery, Covent Garden for evening theater, and to the Metro station directly across the street. The room was as spacious as European hotel rooms go and the view from rooftop lounge was epic.  As Hilton Honors members we were treated to a free drink. Our fridge in the room was refilled daily with complimentary water, soda and cookies.  Perhaps the best feature of the hotel was the breakfast. Well worth the additional cost to the room rate. The buffet included hot items (scrambled and fried eggs, chicken sausage, pancakes, delicious waffles and many other items).  There was a variety of breads, croissants, yogurts, fruit, lox, and jams and jellies (black currant was a pleasant surprise). Also offered was an additional item from the menu included in the price. We ordered omelets and porridge. The restaurant staff made sure our coffee cups were always filled and even provided cups of hot coffee to go when we left the breakfast. Lastly, we loved the hotel staff. Shout outs to the breakfast wait staff, Tom and Michael at the concierge desk, Micah who helped with our bags, Ishmael, Maggie and all the others.  We will return to this gem on future trips to Europe, as London is a great launching place to so many other European cities.",5,2023,03,07
145,Birthday Night Away,"From the moment we arrived Alejandra in reception was so helpful and chatty, even taking the time to wish me a Happy birthday with 2 complimentary drinks and they even went to the effort of putting a Birthday cupcake in the room, all the staff were so helpful and friendly. The hotel was immaculate and the location couldn't have been better. The only disappointment was we were only there for one night, Highly recommend it and will definitely return.",5,2023,03,06
145,Amazing stay,"We had a great experience! The hotel is exquisite! The staff were extremely kind and helpful, everyone from reception, concierge and room service.

We really enjoyed our stay and would definitely come back!",5,2023,03,05
145,Fabulous service & spotlessly clean!,"My partner booked a room at The Trafalgar St. James to celebrate my birthday and the staff went above and beyond to make it special. On arrival we were informed we had been given a complimentary room upgrade, along with two drinks' vouchers to use in the rooftop bar. The room was wonderfully spacious and impeccably clean - the housekeepers clearly pay great attention to detail. I was surprised with a delivery of cupcakes and prosecco to our room from the Guest Relations manager to wish me a Happy Birthday. This was such a lovely gesture! Every member of staff we interacted with was welcoming, friendly and extremely professional - nothing was too much trouble for anyone. I would highly recommend this hotel and cannot wait to return for another stay.",5,2023,03,03
145,Worth every penny,I can't say enough great things about this hotel. The location is excellent and is within walking distance to so many things to see.

Thank you Elena and the rest of the team for such a wonderful memory.,5,2023,03,03
145,A wonderful experience - Thank you Elena!,"My husband surprised my son and I for our birthdays last week and took us to London.  We are a family of four.  

We were greeted with the most wonderful smiling faces on reception, the staff all knew about the surprise and were as excited about it as we were, which made the whole experience even more fun and exciting.  

Elena was such a wonderful part of the whole experience, we were blown away by the personalised cards, written and signed by Elena and left in each of our a joining rooms, one specifically written for me, and one which was also written for Austin, my 14 year old son together with balloons, the most delicious cup cakes, and fizz (for the adults of course!).  Her kindness also extended to helping us find the perfect place to eat in China Town for my birthday.  (Thank you again Elena xxxx)

The hotel has been a favourite of ours over the years, pre kids!!! We hadn't been there for about 14 years so it was wonderful to step into the decor, experience the comfort, style and funky elegance of the rooms and shared spaces.  Wander to the rooftop bar and overlook the majestic views of London by night with a cheeky nightcap, whilst the kids enjoyed their own space in their adjoining room.

It's the perfect hotel in so many ways; location, attention to detail,  service, decor, warmth, it's got it's own glow there in Trafalgar square and has wonderful people working there.  Even when our younger son decided to explore the staircases instead of the lift and got a bit lost, the gentleman on reception was on hand, with a smile to help us find him!

We would go back in a heartbeat.  

Thank you to all of the Trafalgar team for making our surprise trip to London so very special. xx",5,2023,03,02

Maddie checked us in and looked after us throughout our special stay, she is incredible, has a beautiful energy, smile and is a true credit to the hotel. You can trust that Elena, the guest relations manager will take all of your special requests seriously showing a real passion and care to make your stay the most perfect it can be... she is incredible and made my proposal celebration one to truly remember!!

145,Exceptional hotel,"I booked The Trafalgar St James for one night as a surprise for my husband's birthday via Lastminute.com. We arrived easily via the tube at Charing Cross, from which it was an easy 3 minute walk to the hotel. When the lady at check in realised it was a birthday booking, she very kindly upgraded us from a Queen room to a King room (201) which had an amazing view of Trafalgar Square and Nelson's Column. The room was large, bright and airy with everything you would need (and some nice extras such as an umbrella in the wardrobe). The minibar was free, which was really unexpected, with a great selection of teas, coffees, still and sparkling water and coca cola. The bed was very comfortable with blackout curtains which meant we had a great nights sleep. Shower in the morning was also great and my husband commented on how wonderful his stay had been. I would highly recommend this hotel for a sightseeing trip, special occasion or business trip. It was so easy to check in and out too and the staff were very helpful and friendly.",5,2023,02,22
145,Amazing experience 5 stars!,"Very pleased with my experience. Special thanks to Elena who went out of her way to help me out with my special day. Also Liana from the front the house team. The whole team has been very helpful here and made my stay very memorable :)

145,Fantastic stay!,"I would higly recommend this lovely hotel to anyone looking to stay at a really really nice hotel. Great spacious room (Trafalgar King room) and very comfortable bed. Clean and overall great room. The breakfast is also very high quality with your typical english breakfast buffé, served very nicely and also with the included option of choosing one dish off the breakfast menu - I went for avocado toast with poached eggs. Really delicious! The hotel also has a beautiful roof top bar overlooking London Eye and Trafalgar Square. Even in February you could sit outside and enjoy drinks by the warming fires - highly recommended. The hotel also treated us to a complimentary drink which was a very nice, welcoming and generous gesture. Finally - the staff. They truly made our week-end a fabulous experience. As this was a surprise trip for my wife's 50th birthday amenities were sent to our room, prosecco and lovely cakes. Staff always very hospital and keen to help out with anything from restaurant booking to restocking the minibar (which b.t.w. is included). I could not have been happier with our stay at the Trafalgar and we are certainly looking forward to staying at the Trafalgar again and enjoying the great service this hotel proved. Definitely a 5-star stay in a super great location! Thank you Alejandra, Toby and the rest of the FOH team! /Peter, Sweden",5,2023,02,15

145,Best hotel!!!,"Finished up my first visit to London in 8 years and had the best time at the Trafalgar St. James. All of the staff were so helpful specifically Alejandra and Michal.

145,Awesome hotel and perfect location!,"Greeted by Jennifer at the front desk who was so personable and friendly. Lobby was small and stylish, next-door to their restaurant which was so chic. After check in, room 507 was beautiful, playful decor and very comfortable room, bed was comfy and the bathroom was huge especially for London standards. Our room faced the main road but we couldn't hear any traffic or street noise. Windows are like triple paned for maximum efficiency. Mini bar had Coke, Diet Coke and bottled water which was free. Also a Nespresso machine in the room with unlimited pods and creamers as needed. We dined in the restaurant downstairs and it was lovely. Close to public transpiration and some nice dining. I would certainly stay here again.",5,2023,02,06
145,"Perfect location, spectacular staff, and so comfortable","Profesional, friendly, embracing, and accommodating. Rooms clean and comfortable.  Stayed for 9 days.  Everyone at the Trafalgar St. James’s Hilton was customer focused. From behind the desk (Jennifer, Elena, Toby, and Maddie and others), to Mike the concierge with such wonderful restaurant suggestions, and our hostesses at breakfast.

Well done to the Team we will be back",5,2023,01,31

145,Fantastic stay at The Trafalgar St. James,"Spent the WE in London at the Trafalgar St. James. From the arrival to the departure, it was a truly fantastic experience. At check-in we received (HH diamond member) an upgrade to a fantastic suite - without even asking for it. Hotel staff was great, always helpful, very friendly and supportive. Breakfast was outstanding, besides the buffet, the included à-la-carte options guaranteed freshly prepared various options. We also had lunch at reasonable prices and great food. The restaurant - same as the whole hotel - is a beautiful place to spend time at.  The hotel location itself is ideally located, sightseeing, shopping and food options are all in walking distance. Same for public transportation which is just steps away. It was our second stay at the Trafalgar St. James and will come back whenever time allows. ",5,2023,01,28
145,Best trip,"My daughter and I stayed here for the holidays.  Elena took wonderful care of us as did the front desk team including Toby.  The breakfast was amazing, the room was perfect, and the location cannot be beat.  Looking back it was one of our best trips ever and I cannot say enough good things about this property.   Happy to recommend.",5,2023,01,28
145,Trafalgar St. James Over Delivers in Every Way,"We love this hotel. When we arrived, the bellhop came out to greet us and assisted us with our luggage. When we came in, both people at the front desk greeted us and welcomed us to the hotel. Everyone was so friendly and talkative...you can tell they actually care for you. 

The front desk let us know about a rooftop bar that the hotel has and gave us 2 tickets for free drinks. 

After our check-in, we quickly went out to spend the day sightseeing. When we returned in the early evening, we found a nice note and macaroons waiting for us in our room.  I'm guessing they don't do this for every guest but being we are Hilton Diamond members, I'm assuming that is the reason for the nice surprise (much better than 2 free bottled waters that we usually get at other Hiltons).  

We had a late dinner planned so we went up to the rooftop bar for a couple of drinks since we had the drink tickets. While we loved our room, the rooftop bar was amazing. It's a delightful place to sit and enjoy a drink with a wonderful view and atmosphere. We loved it there, and if we had stayed longer, we would have been there every night. 

We did have one bit of miscommunication at the bar though. We got 2 drinks and when we presented them the drink tickets, they told us those were just for wine, beer and well drinks. When I looked at the card, in the small print, it stated this. So the bar charged us for the two drinks...not the end of the world but still a little disappointing. 

When we left to go to dinner, I stopped by the front desk to inform them that they need to make it clear when they give the drink tickets, to make sure the guest understands there are limits to the free drinks.  The front desk was very kind and told us they'd remove the charges....not something we expected.  

We were only at the hotel for 24 hours but we loved our stay and plan to come back when we are back in town in March. We are looking forward to staying at this adorable and lovely hotel. 

",5,2023,01,27
145,Superb event at the Trafalgar St James!,"We just held a superb event at the Trafalgar St James which went perfectly.
The team at the hotel were excellent and delivered outstanding customer service.
In particular Simona Rafaideen in the events team was brilliant in planning our event and anticipated our needs well and gave us reassurance that she and the hotel knew exactly what we needed to make our event a success.
On the day, Carmen Wakeford who greeted us and showed us around the hotel was exceptional. Welcoming, friendly and charismatic Carmen ensured we had everything we needed and she is a great ambassador for the hotel.
Marco on the bar was great too and was very efficient.
The atmosphere in the event space and throughout the hotel, especially the rooftop bar and terrace was delightful.
The Trafalgar St James is a fantastic place to host an event and I can't wait to return. Highly recommended.",5,2023,01,27

145,The Best!!,"I stayed for 8 nights and I can honestly say, having stayed in various hotels of all levels in London, the St. James is the best!!  First of all the location cannot be surpassed, across the street from the National Gallery and a short, enjoyable walk in any direction to London’s main attractions such as Covent Garden, Buckingham Palace, the WestEnd Theatre District, etc. I had a basic King room and it was just as spacious and lovely as the more expensive ones I’ve stayed in at other hotels.  Service was spot-on and in particular the lady who took care of all my housekeeping needs, Renata Nenova, was so wonderful and excellent and noticed whenever I needed anything without my having to ask.  Love this hotel and will be back and send everyone I know!! ",5,2023,01,24
145,Great weekend away,"This hotel is a real gem 
Me and my wife stayed on the 21st of jan 
The whole experience was great , from the support up to our stay , all the way until our check out . 
The bar area and restaurant was very clean and welcoming and the staff were the same . 
The location is perfect if your looking to do some shopping or sightseeing also   Along with any show you would like to see . 
We saw phantom of the opera the next day we spent too much money shopping in designer shops :) oh well it’s London . 
The room was very comfortable and the free mini bar is a great addition. 
We will definitely be staying here again 
Thanks to the whole team ",5,2023,01,23

145,Not a value for money hotel,"We are disappointed of the hotel. This cannot be a five star hotel in chilly London without any heating in the bathroom and such poor , noisy heating system in the room. 
Also, the rooms are not renovated. Not a value for money hotel! Does not worth the cost of ~ 450& a night!",2,2023,01,20
145,Excellent stay,I reviewed a ton of hotel reviews so I am writing this to let you know; location can't be beat. food/service/hotel amenities are amazing. Staff are friendly but genuinely want you to have a good time. Walkable restaurants and stores. Travel solo this location is for you. Clean rooms. Best shower in London. Can't say enough will return definitely.,5,2023,01,18
145,Fantastic hotel in a fantastic location,"We had a wonderful stay at the Trafalgar St. James. Beautiful lobby and rooms. We loved the location- you simply could not ask for a better spot to stay in London. Very comfortable beds, delicious breakfast spread and incredibly kind staff. We enjoyed a cocktail in the restaurant on the main level and the staff could not have been nicer. The ONLY downside was we were in a connected room which is always somewhat annoying because we could hear the other occupants a little too much. It's a small complaint to an otherwise fantastic stay. We will be back!",5,2023,01,17
145,Great Central Location,Great location and friendly service.  Within walking distance to most major attractions.  Breakfast was excellent and concierge was extremely helpful.  The room was comfortable and quiet.  The Rooftop bar is worth a visit.  Highly recommend the Trafalgar St. James.,5,2023,01,16
145,Underrated 5 star hotel that beats the over priced competition in so many areas,"Absolutely lovely hotel.  Rooms are good size and the hotel was very accommodating guaranteeing us connecting rooms at our booking.  Rooms were new, well appointed and perfectly quiet.  They were also ready early which helped us during check in but obviously this depends on availability.  The front desk, concierge and door man were exceedingly friendly and helpful.  The location could not have been better.  Directly across the street from Piccadilly station and within a very short walk to Covent Gardens, Soho and Piccadilly.  The price was far better than many of the other area hotels that are supposedly higher rated but there is no need to go there when this 5 star hotel is available.  Will certainly stay here again.",5,2023,01,15
145,Anniversary celebration weekend at the trafalgar,"From the moment we walked through the doors we felt very welcome and relaxed. Jennifer on reception checked us in early and was very efficient and kind! The hotel room was spacious and spotless! As was the whole hotel.

Back of tv’s full of dust, not to be recommended people at FD very response",3,2023,01,09
145,Holiday Season at the Trafalgar!!!,"An awesome experience!!!  Our first family visit to London and will not be our last.  The Trafalgar is where you want to stay.  It is within walking distance to many of the most famous tourist attractions in London and close to the train stations as well.  The staff is seasoned and there for one purpose, ""to make your stay perfect so that you may enjoy"".

The hotel management and staff was terrific.  They were helpful before we arrived with valuable information and provided daily tips to help us.  Our smile factor was so high that this trip made you not want to leave and also plan the next trip back.  

The bottom line is The Traflagar at St. James is an incredible place and you will love it!!!!",5,2023,01,07
145,New Year Eve at The Trafalgar St. James,"We had our New Year time at The Trafalgar St.James and we are very pleased. Nicely located at Trafalgar Square , with proximity to all main sightseeings and events. The rooms are spacey and clean , the staff friendly and professional, the breakfast buffet of high quality too. Although the hotel is centrally located the double windows prevent the noise from the street and rooms are very quiet. We will certainly be back!",5,2023,01,03
145,"Great experience, location, service and breakfast buffet!","Great location, super clean and comfortable rooms including great pillows, which are a major satisfier.  The concierge offered great service and the staff was really pleasant.  We really enjoyed the breakfast buffet and the rooftop bar was wonderful. Highly recommend for families or folks on tour since the location is so central and easy to walk to sites, shopping and public transportation. ",5,2023,01,02
145,Outstanding visit,"We stayed at the hotel for eight days before Christmas. The location was fantastic, and as busy as Trafalgar Square was with Christmas festivities, once we were in the hotel to was extremely quiet. Easy walk to museums, shopping, West End, The Eye and Buckingham Palace.

The staff was friendly and attentive, and the concierge staff did an excellent job helping us with reservations. This was particularly helpful given we were there at the height of the Christmas season, and had not booked restaurants in advance. We were also notified by the concierge in advance of our stay that there was a national train strike, and he  helped schedule taxis for the airport.

Room was well-appointed, spacious, and the staff did a great job taking care of the room every day. 

Great experience, and we look forward to returning.",5,2023,01,02
145,"Fantastic hotel, staff and the NYE","The staff were so good, room stylish and the NYE Fireworks and dinner were epic. If you're looking for a good NYE choice, close to shops, the castle and obviously trafalgar sq this is it.

145,Superb,Superb hotel in the best location to explore London. The staff are very friendly but still professional. We had great service . The rooms are nicely decorated with a very comfortable bed and a lovely bathroom . We enjoyed a very good breakfast selection with a nice view of Trafalgar Square. Despite being in the heart of Trafalgar Square there is no traffic noise. The added bonus of staying here is the superb ‘roof top’ bar / restaurant an absolute gem of a place with superb views & delicious food .,5,2023,01,02
145,Very good but could have been better,"Seemed a bit understaffed both ground floor bar and roof terrace. But view was delightful and food excellent if not particularly big portions. Staff friendly enough and happy to take photos of me and mum
After meal, headed downstairs in lift and at reception asked politely for nearest toilet to be told there was one where we had just come from and that was that. Rude and unnecessary and not as if we'd just walked in off the street.",4,2023,01,01
145,Perfect for sightseeing,This hotel is ideal for touring London. The location simply can’t be beat. The rooms were large and clean with all the amenities you could ask for. The people were very accommodating. We had breakfast at the restaurant which was a great way to start the day. I couldn’t have asked for more.,5,2023,01,01
145,"Location, style and service.","My wife and I had 3 nights at this beautiful hotel just prior to Christmas.
From the moment we walked in the door the whole experience was first class.
All the staff were so friendly and attentive.
We loved the eclectic decor with photographs of Jagger, Bowie, George Michael etc appealing to our love of music.
We booked the St James room which was perfect for our stay. It was beautifully cleaned each day and checked by a supervisor.
The dining room where we had breakfast each morning was warming and very comfortable with a choice of A La Carte or buffet breakfast.
We used the gym each day to burn off a few of the vacation calories and with treadmills,
Cross trainers and free weights it was more than we needed.
The big surprise for us was one of the best roof top bars in London with not only great cocktails, but awesome views of Trafalgar Sq., London Eye, Big Ben, The Shard and much more.
The location of this hotel is second to none, right smack bang in the middle of London.
On our next trip to the UK, this will be our first stop.

145,A Birthday Party on the Rooftop,"We stay here several times a year for theatre weekends so having a birthday party here. Hiring the space on the rooftop was perfect. The view is spectacular, the food was stunning (the chocolate birthday cake was amazing!). The service was the real standout -- attentive,  friendly, and perfect down to every detail.  We have always ebjoyed the 5* service at this hotel as customers, as a venue for a function it is just as reliably stellar.",5,2022,12,30
145,Fantasy Christmas,We stayed at the Trafalgar St James London from 18th-27th December 2022. From arriving at this lovely hotel to departing everything was amazing and the attention to detail from every member of the lovely team that work at this hotel was second to none my husband and I have travelled the world extensively and stayed in some fantastic hotels we both agreed that this hotel and our experience whilst staying with you rated as one of the best we can’t wait to return. ,5,2022,12,30

Best location, excellent service from the entire staff. The breakfast was fantastic, the roof bar was great!
Without a doubt this is going to be our hotel in London!",5,2022,12,29
145,"Great location, nice rooms and great breakfast!","This was our first time at this hotel, having stayed in London many times and we had a really comfortable stay. It's brilliantly located with easy walking access to pretty much most attractions and especially the theatre and shopping district which we were visiting for.

Toby took care of our booking and ensured we had a really comfortable room with a great welcome set up. 

The room was nicely decorated, in a modern way but with personality and the shower was fantastic, very hot and powerful. Plenty of wardrobe space and hangers if staying a little longer. 

The room set up was great with additional soft drinks and water left as well as tea and coffee making capsule machine. We didn't use this but we thought every need was taken care of. 

The bed was super comfortable with a choice of pillows however, if you are a light sleeper, I would ask for a room not facing the main road as this was a little noisy for me, but my husband and son didn't notice a thing! The black out curtains were phenomenal and ensured a lovely lie in however.

We used the bar on the evening which was great and family friendly and again the next day for breakfast which was super, and I would definitely recommend adding to the booking.

145,Great hotel in a great location,"We had a great stay! The hotel was conveniently located close to the major attractions, had good food choices nearby, and above all the staff was friendly and helpful throughout. The service was always prompt and the rooms were kept clean everyday.",5,2022,12,28

The rooms are well appointed, top notch service and in room extras are perfect. Highly recommend, go for the family room for space. Will return.",5,2022,12,28
145,Amazing stay with family,"We travelled to London with our 4 children for a short Christmas trip. We had connecting rooms at the st James Trafalgar.(king and double queen) 
The Hotel was perfectly located and the staff was amazing. They really strived to make our stay memorable. As Hilton diamond members, we had a free breakfast via room service each morning. A perfect way to get our days started. The rooftop restaurant was delicious for dinner one evening with amazing views of London. we would definitely recommend this property to our friends and family if they travel to London.",5,2022,12,27
145,A perfect stay,"The comfiest bed I’ve ever slept in. The room was spacious and modern, but still felt cozy. All of the details were spot on. The staff at reception and the restaurant were attentive and made our stay absolutely unforgettable. ",5,2022,12,25
145,Not Great,"I had a horrible experience at this hotel and having stayed at 3 separate hotels over the course of this two week trip, I would not mark this one high. I have Diamond status with Hilton and was hoping for a nice experience here on the last leg of the trip and that was not the case.

1) I requested a King room upgrade to be able to enjoy the bathtub after 2 weeks of traveling. I understand this is based on availability, but I was shocked to not even receive an acknowledge that it wouldn’t be able to be accommodated.

2) My room was placed on the 2nd floor NEAR the elevator. My only request in my Hilton preferences is to be placed on a high floor.

3) My view was of a parking garage. It is one thing to be placed on the 2nd floor and at least have a great view…this was not the case.

4) My room was a handicap accessible. 

5) The room bathroom smelled horrible.

6) The restaurant was closed the whole night and I found out at check-in ONLY after I asked. This should at the very least been in the original welcome email so I would be able to make other plans besides room service.

7) My Diamond status was never acknowledged at check in or check out. 

I found the manager lackluster as I did not hear a response back after telling them about my experience. 

The positive is that the hotel is beautiful and the location is great! The restaurant looked great too but I couldn't try.

145,Everything and then some....,"I stayed 4 nights; first visit to London.  Comfortable, private, immaculate, and secure.  Xlnt temperature control.  Nice bathroom.  Customer service excellent, particularly concierge services. They replaced my lost key twice with no complaint.  The first night of the visit I could not figure out how to work the tv.  The fellow from concierge dashed up to my room to demonstrate the control feature.  The last night of my stay another fellow from concierge stayed past his shift to help me with decisions about public transportation vs taxi for returning to Heathrow Int'l. in the early morning.  The dinning room on the first floor was a welcomed plus, because the streets emphasize fast foods or a search for a sit down restaurant.  Met a friend for lunch at the hotel; convenient and we visited for two hours.  Location: across the street from the Admiral Lord Nelson Monument.  Walk to Charing Cross Underground terminal.  Very close to Kensington Palace, open spaces (parks) National Art Gallery, The War Museum, The Embarkment, Covent Garden, Piccadilly, and shopping.  Don't discount travel in early December.  London knows its business and it can be magical to walk the streets at nights with a special friend and a sprinkle of snow for that special touch.  Always felt safe.  Perhaps this is why Hilton Hotels has branded The Trafalgar St. James as one of their ""Couture"" hotels.

The location is , of course, outstanding so close to sights, theatres, and restaurants, However, the real difference was the kindness and helpfulness of the staff including the included breakfast which was as good as any we have ever enjoyed in any hotel. Bottom line, , we will return to this extraordinary hotel on our next trip to  London  which  we hope is very soon.",5,2022,12,15
145,The hotel to stay without any doubts,"We had an excellent experience at The Trafalgar St. James. The bedroom was super comfortable and even though we had one issue with the AC, we got it solved in less than 15 minutes. All the drinks from the minibar were included and every night when we arrived at the bedroom, we could found the bed prepared for ""sleep mode"" as well as water & a glass next to the bedside table (what a detail!). 

The staff of the hotel not only was careful & attentive regarding our stay, but also were charming & polite. We got along with some of them and each time we were passing by the reception we couldn't stop talking!

Regarding other facilities, the gym was quite good but I missed some of machines (so this could be improved) and the breakfast service was complete with several different options. The last thing would like to point out, is the location which is amazing, you can walk to the most touristic places and if not, there's a lot of metro options around Trafalgar Square. 

I have no doubts that if i go back to London, the Trafalgar St. James will be the place to be hosted.",5,2022,12,12
145,Outstanding Hotel in London,"Our experience at the Trafalgar St James was outstanding. The staff was very welcoming, the rooms were cozy and clean, the amenities were superb, and the attention to detail and attention from the staff during our stay was second to none. The breakfast was excellent and the location is outstanding to be able to walk to major sites in London. Also a very quick, 3 min walk to the Tube. Highly recommended for an elevated, elegant, outstanding experience in London",5,2022,12,12
145,Amazing Christmas Mini Break,"Fantastic hotel, with amazing views, staff were polite and friendly, rooftop bar was awesome especially for seeing Christmas lights, drinks were delicious, location was great for walking around London, definitely will return next year",5,2022,12,12
145,No need to look any further!,"I have just completed my 6th stay at this beautiful property.  The fact that the hotel is located in a perfect place (Trafalgar Square and in between two tube lines) should be enough reason to stay here.  But there's more!  This stylish property leaves no detail untouched - even the elevators are beautiful.  The colors are soothing, the linens are top quality, and the bath amenities are high end. I was a little concerned about what size my room would be this trip as I had booked a Standard and I was pleasantly surprised.  The corner room was just perfect.  The breakfast is hearty with a buffet or a la carte option.  Our check-in staff was so friendly and welcoming and our room was ready before the normal checkin time, even though the hotel was fully booked.  I must also give a shout out to the dining room staff, the doormen, and the housekeeping staff. The Trafalgar St. James is one of the few hotels still offering turn-down service.  The thermostat was truly adjustable and the room stayed cool all night!  This is rare in a hotel! And finally, the little tray of sweets waiting on us as we entered our room the first time was a real treat.  We felt so appreciated and honored as guests here.

At a time when so many hotels are understaffed and guests are often left to fend for themselves, the Trafalgar St. James is a breath of fresh air, allowing me to have the perfect, stress-free vacation!  Can't wait to go back!",5,2022,12,11
145,Great stay in the heart of London!,"This hotel is a great boutique hotel. The attention to details was excellent, from the included minibar, high-quality British amenities, and its superb location. The best part of this stay was the staff! ",5,2022,12,10
145,Outstanding,"Outstanding hotel, one of my favorite Hilton properties we’ve had the pleasure of experiencing. Large stylish rooms and art decorated hallways.

145,Trafalgar Hotel Disappointed,"There was a mix up with the reservation regarding the upgraded room that was requested.  Upon arrival it was communicated that I would not receive the room upgrade that was requested and never received any emails says hotel could not accommodate. Staff was not helpful and ended charging more money for less value of a room. The King size bed was stiff with an indentation in the the bed, the toilet was leaking for 2 days. I asked to speak to the Hotel manager Gem  twice and confirmed that Gem was onsite but apparently he thought I as a customer was not important enough for him to come have a conversation with me which is indicative of the service that was provided. He sent Elena guest relations manager who did offer to take 30% off the last night on a four night stay, but this barely covered the difference between the rate I should have paid and the increased price they charged me, nevermind all the time taken from our vacation, the uncomfortable bed, leaky toilet, to try in come to a mutual. In the hospitality business when a customer specifically asked to speak to the hotel manager not only once but twice, take  the time available, no one is that important in the job not to meet their customers.. Needless to say you have lost not only my business but I will not recommend to any family, friends, blogs, social media this hotel.",1,2022,11,21
145,What a gem!,"I went for dinner in the Rooftop with friends and clients last Saturday. The location is amazing, the food delicious and the staff very professional. The view from the Rooftop is very beautiful.  The cocktails are wonderful, it is a must have!",5,2022,11,21

145,Beautiful hotel in a perfect location,"We spent 2 nights with my wife to celebrate our wedding's anniversary last week.
My rating is 10/10, the location, the cleanliness of our room ( Trafalgar King Room ),
the staff, the Rooftop (wow!) are far beyond of expectations. We had perfect breakfast in the beautiful restaurant. If I have to mention one thing for the management to improve:
the window is not opening ( I like fresh air ), but the air condition works perfect, so it was not a problem. I can recommend the Hotel for everybody, we would go back tomorrow!  ",5,2022,11,15
145,"Quality,","Just had a great stay at The Trafalger St James. A very well appointed hotel, perfect location for both business and leisure. Attention to detail just right, would definitely recommend and will be returning for certain. ",5,2022,11,09
145,"Staff, Spacious Rooms, Rooftop Views, Location…ALL AMAZING!!","I’m so glad I booked this place for our last night in London. I wish I would’ve stayed here my entire visit. The hotel was in a perfect location. From check in, the staff was so welcoming and amazing. They took their time to explain everything. The room was so spacious and clean which I love and we even got an amazing note and treat from the manager for being a Hilton Honors member. Very nice touch. We had dinner on the rooftop and everything was incredible from the service, drinks, food, and of course the VIEWS!!! The views were spectacular. I will recommend this hotel to everyone and I am already looking forward to my next visit so I can book this hotel.",5,2022,11,09
145,Location location,"We stayed here for the weekend when it was the queens funeral. The hotel was at full occupancy, but it still gave a relaxed vibe. The breakfast was lovely, the room was well appointed, and the roof top bar was superb.

I think we may just have found our go to hotel when we stay In London in future. I know many other reviewers who stay in various hotels will comment on location, but trust me when I say you really can not beat the location of this hotel.",5,2022,11,09
145,Excellent hotel with great service a stones throw from trafalgar square!,"Stayed for one night to take in a show @ Harold Pinter theatre.  This is an excellent location next to Trafalgar Square. We spent a couple of very enjoyable hours on balmy October afternoon with family members on the roof top bar.  We didn’t have a reservation but we were found a table as we were staying in the hotel by the very helpful and attentive staff.  The views are amazing!
Breakfast was excellent - there was confusion as to whether it was included in our rate ( which it was).  However the lady in charge said not to worry and she would sort out the confusion! Again excellent service.

Would definitely recommend the hotel… it’s very good but rather pricey!",5,2022,11,07
145,Excellent hotel in brilliant location,"Fab stay at an excellent hotel. Very good service from friendly staff (great house-keeping). Perfect, central location for sightseeing with a good breakfast. We are a family and stayed in a generously-sized family room with two large beds.....fitted 4 perfectly. Would definitely recommend.",5,2022,11,07
145,Exceptional Hotel,"I think it is fairly obvious by the location that a London vacation could not be any more central than this hotel, but this amazing hotel has many qualities, such as the roof top bar with panoramic views of London landmarks, the rooms and amenities are all first class, we were big fans of the contemporary decor and iconic art.
I must highlight the Hotel staff’s courteous professionalism, thoroughly enjoyed our stay and will be back soon,
Thank you Toby and the team at Trafalgar St James Hotel.",5,2022,11,07
145,Outstanding Service-first Experience with Outstanding Facilities in the Heart of London,"With an outstanding service-first experience at every interface to the property; a clean, chic, quiet (see below), and well-appointed room with every convenience and touch thought of and provided for; and a central and easily-accessible heart-of-London location, across a three week New York / London / Amsterdam trip, our stay at at The Trafalgar St. James was the highlight property and lodging experience.

Our first interface on rolling to the front door from the Paddington station was a friendly and enthusiastic Michael, who kindly helped us with our bags and brought them to our room. Later, when we needed transportation to dinner, we were again helped by Michael who sprinted across two lanes of traffic and into Trafalgar Square to catch a cab in the roundabout where he then rode it back to the hotel so that we could then take it to dinner.

From there, whether in the hallway, in the lobby, at their beautiful rooftop bar, or in the restaurant, every member of The Trafalgar St. James staff were, at minimum, cheerful and friendly and helpful, if needed.

The only downside I cite is that our first (second) floor room was above a ground floor area where construction (hammering and concrete drilling) was being done every morning, starting at 8:00 AM. While normally, this might not have been a problem, it was interruptive to our jet-lagged sleep schedules, waking us prematurely each morning. However, consistent with the outstanding service at The Trafalgar St. James, when we brought up the issue with them, they were very apologetic and immediately offered to move all of our things to another room on the fourth floor while we were out for the day.

Finally, the outstanding service at The Trafalgar St. James shone again when, on arrival to Amsterdam, we realized we had forgotten a few articles of clothing in the room. The staff (again, Michael) volunteered to ship our clothes to us in Amsterdam and handled all of the logistics.",5,2022,11,04
145,Great Holiday in London.,I loved this Hotel.  The room was large and the bed was comforable.  The staff could not have been friendlier.  Always asking if they could help.  We used the concierge a few times and he went out of his way to help.  Even running outside in the rain to find us a taxi.  We ate at the Rooftop resturant there and the food was delicious.  On the morning we were leaving it was earlier then the Breakfast resturant was open.  My wife ask if she could grab something qickly and there was no problem at all.  She ran in and got some food and then we left.  I will stay there again when in town.  Lots of food in the area of different types.  Hop on Hop off bus was right across the streetLots of places to walk to from this location.,5,2022,11,04
145,Fab stay at the Trafalgar Hilton,"My husband and I took our 13 year old grandson to London at half term and stayed at The Trafalgar Hilton, the location is excellent and we have stayed here many years ago before the renovations took place.  We had a fabulous stay, the staff were all very friendly and helpful.  The room was excellent with a double sofa bed for our grandson, the beds were very comfortable.  We enjoyed a great breakfast in the Rockwell on both mornings and a lovely night cap up at the Rooftop Bar.  We enjoyed it so much we are returning for another stay in 2 weeks.  Totally recommend this fabulous hotel.",5,2022,11,02
145,Great location & staffed hotel,The breakfast was excellent with the most efficient & friendly staff.  Our experiences with all 3 concierge was the best we have known.  They were able to obtain theatre tickets as well as recommend a very nice restaurant near by on short notice.  They also had valuable recommendations for sightseeing excursions.  They could not have been more helpful.  The rooms are comfortable & very clean.,5,2022,11,01
145,"Excellent service, nice rooms and great location.","Excellent service, nice rooms and great location. I Was there for the London Marathon, it is 5 minute walk from the finish line. Breakfast buffet was really nice with many options. I would stay here again anytime. ",5,2022,10,30

Rooms are exceptionally comfortable and extremely clean. 
Can’t recommend it more highly.

Not sure why I need 200 characters for the review to be validddd",5,2022,10,29
145,"Location, Location, Location.","Location, location, location. This hotel is in a great location off of Trafalgar square. The staff is great--very attentive staff. House keeping is fantastic--our room was kept immaculate and turn down service was excellent. Within 10 (or less) minute walk to westminster abbey, churchill war rooms, Big Ben, Parliament, 10 Downing Street, Chinatown, Picadilly Circus, Embankment and Charing Cross Tube Stations, and museums. Area is very safe. Rooms appear to be recently updated and very modern. Rooms are quiet and have multiple windows which cuts down on street noise. There is a bar downstairs and upstairs. Excellent concierge staff who can help with dinner reservations/recommendations, car service to and from airport, getting tickets to shows and sites, etc. Oddly they are cashless--so if you need to get change--you need to go to a store--(I thought this very odd as it makes it difficult to tip folks there if you cant get change). ",5,2022,10,28
145,An Autumn week in London,"First of all, we loved the hotel accomodations and the staff.  The restaurant worked out great for breakfast every morning before we set off for our day in London.  Good food choices including a buffet if you are in a hurry and a lovely staff that were happy to meet all of our requests.
We loved the rooftop bar for a nightcap and a lovely view of the London Eye.
The location is very central to many of the top sightseeing destination.  A short walk to Buckingham Palace, The National Gallery, Westminster Abby and more!  Also just a short walk to the Tube stations so it was very easy to venture out a bit.
The double decker hop-on hop-off station was just outside the hotel.
From location, to accomodations, to a pleasant and very helpful staff, this was a great stay for us!",5,2022,10,26
145,Amazing hotel.  Continues to be one of the best,"This seems to be our home from home for years.  Back again this week to celebrate hubby’s 60th birthday.  

Got to the hotel before eleven and our room was ready.  Totally surprised and so lucky.  I booked a st James king room and love the extra step up for your sitting area.  

Went out for a long wander and came back to a great surprise.  Bottle of Prosecco and some muffins.  What a great gesture and thanks to the staff for organising this. 

This is a great hotel.  Spot on with the various cafes.  Restaurants.  Pubs.  Sights.  We love this hotel and certainly will be back soon.",5,2022,10,25
145,Welcoming and comfortable,"I had a lovely stay here. 
Staff was helpful and welcoming. The room was well equipped and comfortable. Clean, modern, nice amenities and most importantly the bed and pillows very comfortable.
The breakfast was very nice. Optional menu items included in the breakfast price a good touch. Also experienced the restaurant for dinner and was happy with it.
Trafalgar Square is obviously a busy place, even so you weren’t aware of it from the room I stayed in. 
Over all an excellent experience. Will stay again.",5,2022,10,25
145,Quick London Holiday,"This was our first trip the UK and we were covering London and Scotland but were on a really short trip. For the London part, we were referred this property by the family. And boy! we were really happy with this place. Why?

1. Location - This is pretty much in the heart of London right in front of Trafalgar square. Pretty much anything and everything is walkable distance from this place. London Eye, The Museum, Churchill War Rooms, 10 Downing and just about every touristy attraction. 

2. The Food - Surprisingly the food at this place is outstandingly good. The breakfast was specially something that I was very fond of. While were there only for two morning breakfasts, both days I was so happy. Adding some pictures of the Eggs Benedict, Eggs Royale and Avacado toast with eggs

3. Rooftop Bar & Restaurant - This place has gorgeous views both in the night as well as in the day. The London skyline looks super pretty from here. Again the food here is awesome too

4. Service - Friendly and courteous staff at the front office or in the restaurants. Ismail and his team from the Rooftop bar were really nice to us and took good care of us when we were there for our last lunch before we left to the airport. 

5. Budget - It is not a budget hotel. But it's certainly value for money.",5,2022,10,24
145,Heart of London,"At this point, Trafalgar St. James Hotel is like my home away from home. I visit Central London 3-4 times a year and I always stay here. 
The location was the main reason initially for me to choose this hotel but since my last visit, I have been impressed with the amenities, service, and facilities. 
The breakfast is amazing with a buffet and à la carte options. The rooftop visit is a must. Sipping Laurent Perrier and enjoying snacks whilst admiring the view of London at sunset is my favorite thing to do. 
Diamond members do get room upgrades ( I have on most occasions) when available. Even if a room upgrade was not possible due to occupancy then you are sure to get the best-appointed room of the category booked. 

",5,2022,10,19
145,Great Experience,"Location, Staff, Breakfast and Service are all top notch.  Stayed here for a week and I can’t bring up a single flaw with the hotel.  I love the mini fridge concept stocked with soda and water.  Turndown service was so nice.  The only slight issue was that the size of the window in my room was very small but since I was working most of the day it was a non issue.  Everything in central London is within walking distance.  Highly recommended",5,2022,10,18
145,Great Staff,"The staff was friendly and courteous, especially Michael. Thank you, Michael!
The location and Rooftop was absolutely perfect as was the daily morning breakfast. We would definitely stay here again. The only not great comment would be that the restroom in our room was extremely chilly.",4,2022,10,16
145,Visit The Rooftop,"Visited with work colleagues, service was excellent and food was delicious. All Staff were very friendly and professional including welcoming reception on the ground floor. Would recommend to others. Will definitely be visiting again in the future.",5,2022,10,13
145,Amazing stay,"We have had an wonderful time at The Trafalgar St James. From the front desk to the food and drink folks and housekeepers, they were all amazing and made us feel like home. Well done to you. We will see you next time.",5,2022,10,13
145,Perfect,Enjoyed our romantic getaway. Hotel is very clean and rooms are modern. Staff was very helpful and restaurant food is great. Enjoyed dinner in Rockwell and drinks at the Rooftop. Reception team was helpful and kind. Will most definitely be staying again!,5,2022,10,11
145,Amazing experience,"Stayed back in August with my husband. Hotel is lovely, amazing location and beautiful rooms. Staff is super friendly all across the hotel, from reception to Rockwell to The rooftop. Highly recommended and will most definitely will be visiting again in the future!",5,2022,10,11
145,Great west end location!,"We had a bad experience at an Airbnb and needed accommodations at around midnight on a Monday. The Trafalgar St. James London had a decent rate on Priceline so we got in a cab and headed over. When we arrived (my wife, 6yo daughter and I) the front desk staff was extremely kind and welcoming and they even upgraded our room! We had originally booked just that one night, but the next day we decided to extend our stay until the end of the week, since we were already there. The location is OUTSTANDING for seeing shows on the west end. We saw three while we were there and all were within a 10 minute walk from the hotel. It’s also right across from the national gallery AND maybe 15 minutes walking to Big Ben. I probably wouldn’t have chosen this hotel if I was planning way in advance, but it was perfect for my situation and I’m glad we stayed there.",5,2022,10,11
145,Peaceful oasis in a busy City,"We only visited the bar here - happy to find an oasis of calm and civilisation after fighting our way through Soho looking for somewhere nice for a drink on our anniversary. 
Beautiful decor, attentive staff and fantastic gin selection made it a wonderful find. Pricey, but you get what you pay for and it was worth every penny.  Planning on heading back to the rooftop bar/restaurant sometime next summer when it’s a bit warmer. We will definitely be back!",5,2022,10,10
145,Great stay,"Beautiful rooms, good cleaning, great staff and near sights. It's near the tube, Trafalgar square, Buckingham Palace, Westminister and Piccadily circus. We really enjoyed our stay and feelt welcomed from the start. If you are travelling to London, this is the hotel you should stay at.",5,2022,10,08
145,"Great location, great staff","Have stayed there a few times. Location is excellent - especially if your wife is doing the London marathon! Staff have always been great. The Rooftop is always worth a visit, amazing views. Only slight negative was that it was pricy when we had to extend our stay by one night (due to train strike). However, would definitely recommend.",5,2022,10,05
145,Excellent hotel in the heart of London,This is the second time I’ve stayed at this hotel in London. I received excellent service both times and the rooms are very roomy and nice. This hotel is in the heart of the city and close to many tourist sights including Buckingham Palace. I would definitely stay here again.,5,2022,10,04
145,Top Hilton Property In London,"Exceptional property with fantastic staff, clean rooms, great service, and wonderful location.  Breakfast gets crowded in the morning.  I'm coming back and I'm from the US!  I am a Hilton Lifetime Diamond and I've seldom experienced such a talented and attentive staff.",5,2022,10,03
145,Excellent service and location,"Service wise this was one of the best hotels I’ve ever stayed at. All of the staff were friendly and welcoming. The hotel was extremely clean. The rooftop bar has great views of the city. The location is very central with plenty of tourist sites, restaurants and shows nearby. ",5,2022,10,02
145,A hidden jewel,"We booked a 4 day stay in this hotel not knowing great details. We chose it because of location and amenities. We were very pleasantly surprised. It was an excellent hotel. Very modest lobby but the rest were great. Spacious rooms, very clean with excellent utilities. The hotel staff were very friendly and helpful, the restaurants were very good. The breakfast was outstanding. They have a roof-top Restaurant/bar that was very good, they accomadted us to play cards. The best of all is the location: so close to everywhere. It is defenitly worth the price we paid.",5,2022,09,23
145,Views are amazing literally topped off a great weekend,"It’s unusual to have a perfect evening no matter where you go especially when your having food and drinks theres normally a small thing you could improve but there was nothing we would change about our experience here. The staff were all great, the cocktails good, wine good, cheese board excellent and good portions, the atmosphere amazing. Everything was perfect including the views. The overall experience and pricing was great value for money and when visiting London we will return.",5,2022,09,19
145,a wonderful experience,"I had an extremely positive experience at this hotel. I found the staff to be very attentive, helpful, friendly. They were all eager to help me with directions, reserved taxis for me and the concierge walked me to the street where the taxi was waiting as the area was all blocked off due to the Queen's service. I never would have expected that. I believe his name was Michael....not 100% sure. I had a lovely room with plenty of space for my clothes and housekeeping checked on me to make sure I had everything I needed. I was traveling alone and this was an excellent choice. I highly recommend this hotel. The location was ideal.",5,2022,09,17
145,"Luxury, small hotel in a perfect location in London.","Hotel was wonderful, Nelson Double room was spacious and linens where amazing.  Staff was kind and helpful.  The breakfast that was included for Hilton Diamond members was the best we have had.  Fun rooftop bar with incredible views.",5,2022,09,12
145,"Good location, small rooms and poor service","The only good thing about the hotel is the location. There wasn't enough closet space even for one person in a king room. reception, concierge, housekeeping all the services were too slow and very poor. We kept calling to help us with luggage for check out, but no one answered. That was quite frequent, calling reception over and over and no one answered. The room was oddly designed with an elevated sitting area. Not enough light. No view at all which they claim to have (of the square).
Highly overpriced considering the amenities and service.
Not recommended.",3,2022,09,12
145,Awesome!,A hotel I can warmly reccomend to stay at. The service is impeccable and staff very friendly and helpful. The roof top bar is a must when staying here and if you are lucky you will get the same young and entusiastic waiter we had. God humor and althow only 18yo he had the puls on everything in need of knowing to make our stay feel great.,5,2022,09,10
145,The friendliest hotel I’ve ever been in,From our arrival to our departure the staff was very friendly very helpful we truly enjoyed them the room is lovely very clean and location is wonderful.  We had a room that overlooks the Square lots of activity and fun to watch our windows open which was fine most of the time except the little noise at night we just shut them!! Would definitely recommend this hotel we look forward to staying here again,5,2022,09,07
145,Birthday Treat,"My wife treated me as she used to work here as a reservations manager, she made sure we had the best room and greatest of service. Sadly this has now been taken over by Curio but still remains a great place to stay with a lovely rooftop view of Trafalgar SQ. ",5,2022,09,06
145,"Great location, nice hotel, poor poor service","Nice rooms, good location but sadly not the greatest of service. A lovely hotel with lovely rooms and mainly helpful staff. 
The downsides; housekeeping rocks up daily at 430/5pm which for anyone doing the tourist thing, which we were, this isnt really the greatest when you want a quick refresh before going back out. The fact that I made comment on the first day, you would have thought it would have been sorted on the second day. Apparently housekeeping doesn’t start until 430, and so for this reason I am not sure I would choose this hotel again!
On to my next grumble; having decided to stay an extra night in london, we saw that there was availability on the Hilton and Booking.com apps, and so enquired at reception, only to be told the hotel was full! Imagine my surprise when I go ahead anyway, and book my extended stay on the app, and here we are, stying an extra night. I would say Hilton needs to sort its reservations out in-house and lord knows how much business you are missing out on!
Whilst a lovely hotel and great location, the poor service has let the hotel down",3,2022,09,03
145,"Terrific location, staff and rooftop bar","The hotel is located right off Trafalgar Square.  It couldn't be better.  But it is quiet.  You don't hear all the traffic outside.  The staff is very accommodating and friendly.  The doorman, Oscar, was especially helpful while we were there.  The rooms are well appointed and clean.  The rooftop bar is not to be missed.  The views up there are terrific.  Get your reservations early.  It is extremely popular.  The only negative is the dining.  In my opinion, it is not as good as the rest of the hotel.  But to be fair, I only had one breakfast buffet.  We ate elsewhere.  Other than that, the hotel was fabulous.",5,2022,09,01
145,A wonderful place to stay-customer service second to none!,"I had a girls trip recently to London, and I always want to stay in Trafalgar square area as its a nice area, coffee shops, etc.  We stayed at the Trafalgar St. James (A  Hilton curio property) for 5 nights.  The property was beautifully maintained, the rooms were wonderful, the Rooftop restaurant was great, but what impressed me the most was the phenomenal customer service.  Naomi the manager was wonderful and so helpful.  Additionally, Marco, the concierge desk was helpful and even Oscar, the employee who assisted with luggage was so friendly.   We looked forward every day to conversing with the staff, and them providing information that enhanced our trip.   Additionally, the breakfast cannot be beat!  As a gold member, we had free buffet every morning with such an array of selections.  Part of this was the ability to order eggs benedict and the best cappuchino coffee!  Hats off to this great hotel, great location, and superior customer service!",5,2022,08,30
145,Don't be fooled by the pretty facade,"While the location could not be better, everything else about the hotel was a disappointment.   Staff at a hotel can really set the tone for a vacation stay and in this instance the poor attitude and morale certainly tainted our stay.  Couple that with room cleanliness issues and construction noise, we not just found it to be horrible value but an unpleasant stay.  ",1,2022,08,27
145,Exceptional service,"My family and I just returned from London celebrating our daughter’s high school graduation and we wanted to send a note.  We stayed at the Trafalgar from 7/30- 8/4 and from 8/9-8/13.  Aside from London being an amazing destination, our vacation was so much better because of our stay at the Trafalgar!   Of course the hotel accommodations was superior but it was the FIRST CLASS service provided by the staff that made our stay thoroughly enjoyable.  Every single staff member that we engaged with was welcoming, kind and over the top accommodating!   We’re so embarrassed that we did not get any names (except the amazing Noemi) but have imprinted all of you into our memory!   Thank you for making this trip even better than we could have hoped for!  

During our stay we had a small incident where my husband needed some medical care.  After quickly assessing the situation, Noemi immediately dispatched a doctor to attend to him in our room within a couple of hours!  Bravo to you and your team for delivering exceptional care and service to your guests!  

We can hardly wait to come back to London – just to stay at the Trafalgar! 

See you soon!",5,2022,08,27
145,Confusion over booking at checkin,"We had booked a family room for my myself, husband and daughter via the Hilton website but when we arrived the booking was for a double for 2 people. Reception made me feel a bit embarrassed even though it wasn’t our fault and the same receptionist had emailed me the day before to ask how old my daughter was so I know my booking was correct. 
After that the mistake was resolved, things improved. Breakfast was excellent and location cannot be beaten.",4,2022,08,27
145,Can't Wait to return!,"Visiting from Paris with my 2 daughters, this was our second time this year at the Hotel Trafalgar Saint James. Great hotel, central location, quiet room, cool roof-top bar/restaurant with a view. Most importantly, everyone did everything to give us a warm welcome and make our vacation a success. Everyone was wonderful, but special thanks go to Tom Howard and Michael Neal and the rest of the concierge team. Ms. Noemi Mannelli, Guest Relations Manager was charming, along with her kind colleagues at the welcome desk. The ever-cheerful Mr. William Thackray, Breakfast (and Lunch) Manager at the Rockwell helped us to start each day on a positive note. He led his friendly team perfectly to provide us with a sumptuous breakfast in the lovely Rockwell Restaurant room. Can't wait to go back!",5,2022,08,25
145,Fantastic Rooftop Bar,"Visited on a few occasions for a couple of drinks. Very high standard, amazing views. Would visit again once in London. Staff very friendly and professional, didn't try the food but looks amazing. Place to visit if in London.",5,2022,08,24
145,Outstanding,"A fantastic location. Reception staff couldnt do enough, they went over and above. Bell boys extremy friendly, bar staff on the roof were amazing, the views were incredible bar prices on par with bar prices in London.

Room was amazing very clean cleaners couldnt do enough extra water and coffee no problem.

The breakfast was the best ive had, no rushing you out. Coffee on tap. Food top quality.

Didnt use the gym as it had no pool.

Bathroom was stunning and lots of products. 

Cant praise the team enough. We will be back.

Thank you",5,2022,08,20
145,Amazing Experience,"I had stayed at the Hyatt Churchill which is OLD then moved to this property, this property is fresh new super clean.  This is centrally located, I would definitely be returning to this property. Marco customer service is amazing!  ",5,2022,08,18
145,Gorgeous building in fabulous location,"Stunning building that oozes class.
Breakfast was in a beautiful room and very tasty (although maybe a little limited after a few days). We also had a small issue with ordering coffees twice without them arriving, so had to seek them out.
The room/bathroom were beautiful, very much 5*. Totally silent, excellent air-con. Our particular room was missing a work desk, but then again, we hadn't requested one.
Rooftop bar has amazing views, although a bit disappointing that a) hotel guests can't reserve specific tables, and b) we had to get back up and look for a waiter and no-one came to serve us (bearing in mind there are few tables).
On the plus side, Oscar downstairs/on the door was pleasant, friendly, informative, and worthy of the 5-star tag.
The one thing I missed was a large lobby area, and for that reason I might go back to the Conrad St James, but that's just a personal preference, and you can't argue with the Trafalgar location.",4,2022,08,14
145,Large hotel bar and a spectacular rooftop bar near to Charing Cross Station,"Popped in for an evening cocktail and business chat, first visit after lockdown and to get a rooftop view, a spectacular look out over iconic night time London.

A pleasant, large, but rather dated characterless ground floor bar and must admit the martini was poorly made and presented. However the rooftop is the main draw on a warm night just with DJ style background music.",4,2022,08,13
145,Fantastic,"First rate in every aspect. We have spent many weekends in Hiltons in London over the past couple of years and some seem to have struggled since COVID. This was our first stay back at the Trafalgar and it was perfect in every way - the doormen / reception team welcoming you every time you came back to the hotel !The breakfast was first rate - great choice and great quality ! Noemi the guest relations manager did all she could to make our stay that extra but special. The room was spotless - and a great view of Trafalgar Square ! 

We will be back and highly recommend !!!!",5,2022,08,08
145,Awful,"Booked to stay at this hotel for one night. When we got to the floor our room was on there was an odd smell in the corridor. We opened the door to our room and the smell got worse. When we went into the bathroom the smell was overwhelming. It was the smell of dirty drains. We run the taps and the shower hoping it was just stagnant water in the pipes but it didn’t help. We had an appointment to attend so on the way out we reported it to reception, they were going to send maintenance up to sort it out. When we got back about an hour later we were told the problem had been sorted. We got back to the room and the smell was still there. We called reception to tell them and said we couldn’t stay in the room because of the smell and could they move us to a different room but we got told there were no other rooms available and if we couldn’t stay in the room we would have to check out. They didn’t try to find us another hotel, Or offer to get us a taxi to the new hotel that we had found and booked ourselves. When we called Hilton to complain they had no interest at all and were actually quite rude. We are Hilton honours gold members and have spent a  lot of money with Hilton this last year and expected a better response from customer services than we received. Needless to say we will never be staying at another Hilton again! Very disappointed with the treatment we received",1,2022,08,05
145,"Excellent location, top notch service","The Trafalgar St. James is a quiet, beautiful oasis in the very heart of the city. Upon arrival we had a quick check in by friendly staff. The bellman was very helpful in settling us into our rooms. We had two connecting rooms since we were traveling with a teenager. Hilton allows you to specifically book connecting rooms on their app vs some of the other hotels where you can only request them. I immediately noticed how large the room was. Much larger than ones I have had in the past in London and other major cities. The mini fridge was kept stocked with complimentary water and cokes. We received great service at the rooftop, at breakfast and at the Rockwell bar. Maurizio is a great bartender there. We enjoyed the big breakfast every day before we headed out. You can get to so many of the places you might want to tour with just a short walk. You are also a short walk from the river where you can enjoy a sightseeing cruise. St. James Park is close at hand and makes for a lovely walk. We were very happy we booked at this hotel and really enjoyed our stay.",5,2022,07,31
145,Best Stay Ever!,"This was my favorite hotel experience of all time! I’ve grown accustomed to staying at nice hotels/resorts while on family vacations. The staff at The Trafalgar St. James is what made the experience beyond my expectations. Sure, I enjoyed the great location, the best rooftop bar in London, and the delicious daily breakfast; however, the team made this the most memorable. This is where I’ll be staying on my future visits to London.",5,2022,07,29
145,Above and beyond!,"'Above and Beyond' is the only way I can describe the level of service every member of the hotel team delivered for us. We expect great service from a prestigious hotel brand in a fantastic city location. That is what we are paying for. However, when the team go 'above and beyond' it makes a great stay turn into a truly memorable stay. It has been a tough few years for all of us so when we decided to take a city break to get away from it all, without flying, we selected the Trafalgar London as our escape. It was way more than a city break. Your welcome, attention and overall exceptional service made our 4 days feel like more than a week. We really didn't want to leave. For any guests reading this review my simple summary would be ""memories are remembered long after price is forgotten!"" Thank you to the entire Trafalgar team for making our short stay a long memory.",5,2022,07,26
145,Not Family Friendly,"We were stopping over in London for three days after a 24 hour international travel day. We booked and happily paid for the night before our arrival so our family, esp the 3 year old, would have a place to nap immediately upon arrival. We arrived and were given a room, although beware the pictures on the website show an elevated loft sofa bed area (aka perfect for a toddler) but I was very rudely told that those pictures are only guides. Oh well, we thought. Misleading but only mildly frustrating. Then, we get to pulling out the sofa bed for the much needed toddler nap- no bedding. We called both the front desk and the concierge to try to locate housekeeping to ask for the bedding. When asked, both folks said “you must tell me exactly what is the problem.” Confusing because we said there is no bedding? No one came for another 30 minutes. At this point, as expected, we have a crying child. I combed the floors and found a member of housekeeping. He asked me again why I would need bedding for the pull out sofa. He came 15 minutes later with the bedding. All this definitely negated the point of paying for a room in advance, especially given we were rudely spoken to at every turn for asking for a basic part of the room.",1,2022,07,25
145,Our recent second stay here will be our last,"This was our second stay at the Trafalgar St James, having stayed here pre-COVID with our kids. I am Hilton Gold, and we decided to return to the same hotel since it was familiar.

I booked a St James King room, the nicer king room with larger space. The room was only available for the first 2 nights of our 3 nights in London, and called the hotel to request that they inform me of any cancellations for the third night so I could grab the room. I kept checking as well and a week later, a Trafalgar King room became available so I called to hotel to book. They recommended not booking the Trafalgar King because it was a lesser quality room for the full stay, and if I kept the St James room for the full stay, I would have to change rooms... and a St James room was still likely to become available, so hang tight. We checked in for our stay and still didn't have a room for the third night (no problem, it's a risk we took). 

Upon checkin, the front desk informed us that they were overbooked and needed to DOWNGRADE us into a Trafalgar King room. We said no figure out something or someone else -- and after talking to a few people, they told us this was an involuntary downgrade and we had no other option. I am Hilton Gold, we had PREPAID for our nonrefundable stay, and not even a first-time stayer at this very property. 

I explained I had already called to add a Trafalgar room for our third night and was told not to do it, and now I'm being downgraded into that room anyway? The room had a terrible interior view of an adjacent building, in addition to being a different layout than the St James room booked.

The manager asked if he could do something to compensate us and I asked exactly what he could do. He offered make a reservation at the hotel restaurant. I laughed and said no thanks I can make reservations for myself. I ensured that the rate difference between the Trafalgar King and St James King rooms would be credited, and they said it would be. 

I later received an email from the manager telling me he would make a table reservation for 4pm for drinks and light snacks, he would meet us there and pick up the tab. We get there at 4pm, and ask the hostess if a table under our name is reserved - no, there isn't. We ask if a table under the manager's name was reserved (Toby) - no, there isn't. We had a couple of drinks at the bar and leave. I sent an email to Toby letting him know we were there but he was nowhere to be found, and that there was in fact no table reserved.

We made a reservation at the Conrad St James (fine place, by the way) for the final night, so we leave the hotel. I obtain a receipt of charges upon checkout, and (a) there has been no adjustment in the rate for either night for the involuntary downgraded room, and (b) the 3 drinks we had at the bar when the manager broomed us were still on there. I was asked by the front desk - the same lady who checked us in and downgraded us - how our stay was and if everything was great. 

I don't care about the money, frankly -- my wife and I were in Europe for the first time since COVID, and we were off to the Loire Valley and Paris for a few days each after leaving London and this ridiculous hotel. We booked here because it pretends to be a high-class hotel. 

I'm taking the time to post this and let you all know this hotel is NOT upper-class. There are clearly not sufficient premium rooms to make sure you get one - even if you book one, as a gold member, on your second stay, and pay a nonrefundable booking. For the price, you CAN - and SHOULD - stay at an ACTUAL upscale hotel, with staff who get things right instead of giving you headaches on vacation/holiday. 

Looking forward to returning to London ASAP - and staying somewhere far better.",1,2022,07,20
145,Our go-to London hotel of choice,"This is now our first choice hotel in London. Great location (as the name suggest), excellently appointed and large rooms, wonderfully clean with a new feel, excellent service, very good breakfast (free for Gold & above HH members), a fantastic rooftop bar and restaurant. 

We must specifically mention Michael who was wonderful in helping us with our every need, providing advice and getting us in our way to the airport. All of the staff were excellent. 

We stayed in a Nelson double queen room which was perfect for us (2 adults, 2 kids) during our short stay. The beds were very comfortable and the block out blinds were actually block ours. Nice touch in that drinks in the mini bar are complimentary. 

We loved this very friendly hotel.",5,2022,07,17
145,Best hotel ever!,"Great hotel and location, the best I've ever stayed at. Outstanding staff. Best concierge service I've experienced- Michael and Adrian were friendly, helpful and always available. They helped us find our way around the city, get tickets to attractions and gave us advice on places to visit. Can't say enough about how great they were. Steps from Trafalgar Square and the National Gallery. Walking distance to Westminster Abbey, Big Ben and the London Eye. Highly recommend!",5,2022,07,16
145,Staying Here is a Must!,"Best hotel I've ever stayed in. Trafalgar Hilton has the most comfortable bed I've ever slept in. Staff was amazing, breakfast was great, and the location was perfect. If you visit London, I highly recommend staying here.",5,2022,07,10
145,A hotel not to be missed in London.,"We’ve now stayed in this hotel a few times and to be honest it just gets better! The location to my husbands London office was the reason for our first visit and we fell in love with the hotel. The hotel is one of the best in London and the rooms are spacious and very well appointed. Beds are very comfy and the view from the roof top bar is breathtaking! However, the staff is truly the reason to stay. From check in to check out they are always on top of your needs. The staff on the roof top is incredible and could not be nicer! Noemi is so helpful I will be making sure she’s around when we return later this year. She’s just fun to talk to and get the news on what’s happening! Currently the hotel main restaurant is rather limited on choices but what we did have was good.",5,2022,07,06
145,The Trafalgar St James was Amazing!,"We have our entire family at the hotel with six rooms. They took great care of us. The rooms were very nice, the location is perfect and the daily breakfast was superb. They always organized an are for us to eat together every morning and took care of our many special requests.",5,2022,07,04
145,Great place,Overall very solid hotel with strong customer service. The staff tries hard to be accommodating and the bar drinks are amazing. Breakfasts was fast and a legitimate full breakfast. The location is also very central. My only knock is that occasionally after long day they would occasionally knock on the door  (right as getting into shows) just to check on things. This is nice but depending on timing can be inconvenient but this it not picky.,5,2022,07,01
145,"Excellent hotel, but...","We recently stayed 3nights, mid week, in this hotel. The staff were friendly and helpful: the room was good and very clean: the breakfast was excellent.
Now the but, our room was at the back of the hotel overlooking a busy construction site. All day, starting at 7am, the noise was horrendous. 
It was unfortunate that our experience of such a good hotel was ruined.",3,2022,07,01
145,The Gem of Trafalgar Square,"Perfectly situated small hotel without pretentiousness.  This is a wonderful hotel.  The rooms are a great size and very comfortable.  Being a smaller hotel, the staff recognizes you with a high level of friendliness.  Adrian at the Concierge Desk was invaluable. He was able to recommend terrific restaurants within a short walk from the hotel. Be sure to try Milo’s (high end Greek) and San Carlos (wonderful Italian) for dinner.  At San Carlos,  ask for Alexandros to wait on you!  You won’t be sorry!",5,2022,06,30
145,"Good location, bad experience","AC is not working, construction site view, you cant change dates of your booking, they charge you full instantly and there will be no refund what so ever. The location is good, modern furniture, clean room",1,2022,06,30
145,Amazing,"My wife and I stayed here for 4 nights from June 22-26.  Everything about the experience was wonderful.  The room was comfortable and clean.  The amenities were wonderful (especially the rooftop).  Most importantly, the hotel staff were exceptional.  Anytime we crossed paths with a staff member, from front house to housekeeping, we received a warm greeting and questions about how they could be of service.  

The hotel itself is in a wonderful location.  10 minutes walk to the Thames, Piccadilly, Buckingham Palace, Westminster, or Chinatown depending on the direction.  Charging Cross tube station is 100 feet from the front door, and a plethora of bus stops are a few steps from the hotel.  

We highly recommend.",5,2022,06,29
145,New Favorite Hotel,"Family stay with teens for 4 nights, with two connecting rooms (1 queen and 1 king). 

Rooms on the 6th floor were very appointed, which included refreshments (water, soda, tea, coffee), very nice toiletries and bath robes. No noise from the rooftop bar/restaurant, despite being very close to it.

The staff could not be more helpful or friendly. The included breakfast buffet was excellent with a great selection of items, including full English if you wanted it.

The hotel and location suited us very well and we would not hesitate to stay again. 

I've stayed in many hotels all over the world, and this is one of the best. 

And don't forget to have a drink on the rooftop and enjoy the view.",5,2022,06,29
145,Fantastic,"Our family of 2 adults and 2 children (9 & 11) stayed for 3 nights. We found the location of the hotel to be fantastic with many of the sights within walking distance. 

Our room (nelson double Queen) was well appointed, the refreshments and toiletries were a lovely touch. The staff could not be more helpful or friendly both when we asked for assistance and in passing.Breakfast was excellent with a great selection of items. 

The hotel suited our family very well and we would not hesitate in recommending it.",5,2022,06,27
145,Outstanding location,"Absolutely wonderful location especially in the colder months, as you are right on the doorstep of tube, market & taxis can stop immediately outside. Huge bonus for when you have heels. The hotel is very trendy chic and especially suitable for couples / catch ups as there is a perfectly balanced artistic luxury, exciting decor and wonderfully friendly staff.",4,2022,06,27
145,Not our first choice,Late decision to visit London this weekend with our daughters for West End Live. The hotel wasn’t out first choice and we wouldn’t stay here again. Very over priced and the breakfast was not 5 star as suggested by the restaurant manager. I need to be more organised and will stick to the Savoy in future.,2,2022,06,27
145,London quick trip,We only had a day and a half to stay in London and the hotel was great for location and accommodation.  They were very helpful getting us what we needed though we weren’t there long.  Our room was very nice and quiet which was nice after a day of activity.,5,2022,06,16
145,The Perfect Hotel in Central London (with a view!),This hotel is centrally located in Trafalgar Square a few minutes walk from The National Gallery and a short walk from Big Ben and the River Thames. The staff was amazing and the restaurant for breakfast as well as the rooftop bar has some splendid views of Central London. I highly recommend this hotel for visiting London on business or pleasure.,5,2022,06,15
145,Best hotel ever!,"We adore this hotel! From the welcoming staff to the artwork and rooftop bar, this is an amazing place to stay In London. On Trafalgar Square and walking distance to most west end attractions, this hotel has an exceptional location complemented by an exceptional staff and bars.",5,2022,06,14
145,Excellent all round.,"We had a lovely stay here for one night at the weekend. Fab location! Really comfortable and well decorated room which was unbelievably quiet given its location. Nice rooftop bar to enjoy a cocktail and take in the views. Staff attentive, friendly and helpful. Would definitely stay again.",5,2022,06,14
145,Wonderful Hotel,"I would rate this 5 circles but we had A/C issues.  Otherwise the hotel is definitely 5 circles.  We stayed 7 nights in aTrafalgar king room.  Our A/C wasn't working on the 5th floor so we were moved to the 1st floor thinking it would be resolved.  A/C worked during the day and then did not operate during the night.  The room warmed up in the night and did not provide as comfortable a sleep as it could and should have.  Still had issues even on the 1st floor but by the 5th night the A/C was working in our room thanks to a wonderful maintenance fellow that came to the room, 'spent time' and did something to resolve the problem.  Reception was concerned and caring about the issue which was also appreciated. 

The room was spacious, the bathrobes provided were beautiful, nice towels and linens, along with amenities.  The complimentary mini bar with still and sparkling water, diet coke and coke was a nice touch.  There was also tea, coffee and butter cookies!!   Location is great!

Staff are amazing at this hotel.  They are caring, attentive and welcoming.  Everyone from the doorman, the bellman, concierge to reception were great.  Housekeeping was excellent, requests were met, room was clean.  Breakfast was fantastic!!  Menu items plus a buffet and everything you could want.   Can’t say enough about the staff at the hotel.",4,2022,06,14
145,Excellent staff and very nice hotel,"We stayed for 6 nights and found the hotel to be outstanding with respect to location, comfort, amenities, and overall quality. Very honestly, the staff members were universally kind, helpful, and accommodating, including cleaning staff, who did a great job. No complaints. We felt well taken care of and enjoyed our stay. ",5,2022,06,07
145,Jubilee stay 10/10,"Centrally located, we had a lovely room  spacious with a free mini bar of water and coke.  Beautiful bathroom with a huge bath and separate shower.  The cleanliness was 10/10.  You don’t hear any noise from other rooms or the corridor.  The beds are super comfy I could have easily stayed in it all day! 
Breakfast buffet was really nice with a good choice.  The best part of this hotel is the staff they are so accommodating nothing is too much trouble they are all polite from the doormen, housekeeping, reception, breakfast staff. They are a credit to the Hilton brand. 
Thank you for an amazing stay.",5,2022,06,05
145,The Jewel in the Hilton’s Crown,"As a Diamond Hilton Honors member I do 100+ nights a year and this has to be my favourite Hilton. Not only is the decor contemporary, the breakfast delicious and the rooftop cocktail bar luxurious, what makes this hotel special is the team members. I would like to mention two exceptional individuals, firstly Noemi Mannelli who understands the customer experience and delivers it to the highest level. She was professional but warm and made my partner and I feel very welcome during our 5 night stay. Also Tom Howard (Head Concierge) who was super friendly and always helpful with a great sense of humour. 

During our stay there was a security alert where Trafalgar Square was closed down. Both Noemi and Tom handled the situation impressively, ensuring us and the remainder of the guests were safe, putting their own well-being at risk. To say we were overwhelmed with their handling of the situation was an understatement. A heartfelt thank you to both of them and these team members are a great asset to the hotel and the Hilton Brand! 

This was our second time at this hotel and we will be back.",5,2022,06,05
145,Great location but noisy,My husband and I stayed here for two nights over half term. We were looking forward to two quiet nights away without the children. Hotel staff were very accommodating on check in. Room itself was nice but the drains in the bathroom caused an unpleasant odour. Beds were comfy and great blackout blinds but the walls were very thin and we could hear people in the adjoining room talking past midnight both nights which disrupted our sleep. This was unfortunate as the hotel itself has a great central location and near all the attractions.,3,2022,05,31
145,Could be cleaner!,Spent a few nights here for travel and had requested a room change. We originally asked to have a tub verses a shower and this request was overlooked and we were given a shower only. The main reason for requesting a change of rooms is because the toilet seat had a stool stain that evidently although cleaned remained and should have been replaced with a new seat. The rug in the room was cleaner in high traffic areas but not under the bed where there was a used toothpick nor the stairs where there was crumbs. The replacement room was cleaner at first glance and we felt like the manager did accommodate us properly. The location can not be better for seeing major attractions in London.,4,2022,05,29
145,Memorable stay in a London Sanctuary,"Just returned from a 6-night stay at this beautiful sanctuary hotel!  Service is top notch!  Room was super clean, comfortable and decorated in a modern style. I received a Diamond upgrade to the St. James Family Room with King size bed on the first floor facing Canada House and could see Trafalgar Square.  Room was quite spacious with a sofa and coffee table. Comfortable bed. Having a fridge with water and soft drinks complimentary and restocked daily was a big plus! There is a Nespresso machine and ceramic tea kettle as well. I received a welcome plate of chef-made treats upon arrival. Turndown service every night. I came back to the room in the late morning and saw a team of 2 housekeepers cleaning the room quite thoroughly, wiping down everything.  Front desk and concierge are very helpful. I was able to buy a Covid test from the concierge for £25 for my flight back to USA. I would especially like to thank Noemi Mannelli and adorable front desk clerk Marco for their efforts in making my stay one of the most memorable in London!  The location is centrally located to many places.  Lots of traffic outside but you would not know in the room. Breakfast available at hotel restaurant called Rockwell. There is a full buffet or you can order off the menu.  I felt very secure in this hotel. You need your room key to access the floors in the elevator. I highly recommend this hotel.",5,2022,05,27
145,"Great Hotel, we will definitely come back","The hotel location is perfect, on the Trafalgar square and very close to the Charing Cross underground station.

Although the hotel is close to the Trafalgar and the room was facing the square, the room noise isolation was perfect.

The room (ST. JAMES KING ROOM) was very big, clean, and equipped with everything we needed.

The hotel staff were great, nice, and welcoming.
they always made sure our stay is good and we got everything we need.

If you want to stay in the center of London, this hotel is a perfect choice!",5,2022,05,27
145,Superb view of Trafalgar square,"We visited the roof top bar for drinks .
This was for a celebrative pre dinner cocktail and the venue was excellent. The staff were very attentive and it made for an enjoyable start to the evening.
We were fortunate with the weather but there are canopy's if the weather turns , so it is well worth a visit.",5,2022,05,26
145,The Rooftop Bar - Amazing Venue & Views,"Visited here after seeing an Instagram recommendation. Reserved a rooftop table - which is no doubt highly recommended. A 90 minute time limit was imposed, which gave us plenty of times to have drinks, food, & appreciate the great views of the bustling Trafalgar Square below, particularly as it was such a sunny day.
Food menu (tapas style) had plenty of choice, with good sized portions. The 5 items we ordered were all tasty, cocktails were great, staff & service very friendly & attentive - would definitely recommend & visit here again!",5,2022,05,23
145,Double Booked!,"Stayed here before, had a great time, very nice hotel. Booked a return stay for my wife and my wedding anerversy on 20th May 2022, booked the room in November 2021 to ensure availability. Received a phone call on 18th may top say ""sorry we have double booked your room and your stay has been moved to our sister hotel in Victoria"". I said how could this occur? I booked 6 months ago, surly another guest has booked in the interim and they should be moved. They offered me a taxi to new hotel! I canceled the booking and will not book again. My wife and i stayed in another hotel in Whitehall who had a room, very lucky.",1,2022,05,23

145,The Trafalgar Hotel,Bad experience during my stay in this hotel Lack of attention to the cleanliness of the rooms Lack of attention to the comfort of the guests The sound of the air conditioning is loud and the towels are not changed after use,2,2022,05,20
145,Comfortable and friendly,"I booked 2 rooms for my mother and I just for one night as we were celebrating her birthday with a show. Our rooms on the 3rd floor were very spacious with comfy bed and for once, decent pillows! I have discounted going back to other London hotels due to their hard / inflexible / polyester wadding pillows!  We spent a completely silent night, apart from a couple of times there was the noise of glass bottles being poured from one bin into another, but it was over quickly.

The shower was nice and big and very clean and the Molton Brown products are lovely.

The pretty receptionist with short blond hair was extremely helpful and lovely. We went out for breakfast and ended up losing track of time and panicked slightly when we were too far away to be able to get back for the 12pm check out time! I called and she was lovely and said not to worry about it as we were on our way back anyway.

All in all a lovely experience, would definitely return.",5,2022,05,09
145,Building Works - Avoid,"The building demolition work going on next door made it extremely noisy in our room, which was situated round the back. There was no notice provided prior to booking and the staff seem very unapologetic. If you are out all day it may not be an issue but it starts at 08:00 and finishes at 18:00. Also had to call reception a couple of times as an alarm was going off in the basement, again no apologies for the inconvenience.",2,2022,05,06
145,"Excellent Roof Top View, Cocktails and Food","Visited the roof top bar the weekend of the Tyson Fury fight. 

Pros: 
- Excellent View of London (big ben, london eye, shard) 
-Great Quality food and cocktails 
-Fast Online Booking System
-Fast and polite staff service
-Reasonably priced considering the location 

Cons: 
- none",5,2022,05,04
145,Could be better,"General aesthetics are good, great location, but not as luxury as you'd imagine for the price.

Booked this specifically for a R&R staycation after a lovely day out in London. Was looking forward to coming back to a lovely hotel and having a decent night's sleep but unfortunately stuck next door to a loud room. Looks like it won't be much of a restful night afterall. What a waste considering the price you pay, expect more soundproofed rooms.",2,2022,04,30
145,Perfect stay in a perfect location,"Perfectly located on the south side of Trafalgar Square.  Staff were welcoming and attentive.  Room was very spacious, much more than similar London hotels.  Great roof bar (best to book).  Beautiful room where breakfast is served.",5,2022,04,30
145,Excellent location,"Our family of three adults booked a family room with a king size bed and a sofa bed.  The hotel was perfect to explore London and easy walking distance to restaurants and shops.  Through our booking, we were given food credit and ordered room service breakfast.  The omelets were disappointing and not exactly what we ordered and some of our order was missing.",4,2022,04,19
145,Excellent accommodations and service with central location ,"We stayed at the Trafalgar for a week in April of 2022. We had a St James King room on the 4th floor and had purchased the morning breakfast package.

The hotel is located right off the square. This means it is convenient to the Charing Cross (Bakerloo and Northern Line) tube station. It is also a short stroll from Covent Garden, The National Portrait Gallery, Leicester Square and many other commonly visited locations. 

The room was clean and comfortable. The fridge always had free water and soda. There were also some tasty shortbread cookies. Service was excellent and we had no concerns during our stay.

The morning breakfast was a buffet which included hot options for a traditional English breakfast, three types of bread, two Neal's Yard dairy cheeses, pastries yogurt and fruit. There were also several options available from the menu. Mimosas were also available. The staff was excellent, very friendly and pleasant in the morning.

We had dinner one night at the Rockwell. We had a tasty and creative approach to a pasta dish which was delicious and well presented. The Rockwell also has a good bar which is well stocked and features some original house cocktails. The Rockwell is a great option on those evenings when you’ve worn yourself out. 

On the whole, I'd recommend the Trafalgar highly, we will certainly be back. ",5,2022,04,17
145,London with my love!,Perfect location and lovely experience. Room was fabulous and stay was completely first class! Loved every second of the holiday! Hotel staff was super and kind!

145,Absolutely wonderful!,"We have just had a wonderful one night stay and we can’t wait to return. The location is perfect but it is definitely the staff that make this hotel stand out from the rest. We met Will in the rooftop bar (I believe he is actually the breakfast manager though) he is an absolute star, so chatty and polite and had a little birthday brownie sent over for my partner. This will now be my go to hotel in London and the views from the rooftop bar are stunning!",5,2022,04,07
145,All Hilton’s need to be like this!,"I’ve visited this hotel many times and made use of the bar, restaurant and rooftop bar but have never stayed.
On a chance encounter I managed to book it on a Sunday before spending some time in London and availed of point redemption.
Wow, I’m thinking I need to change from the Hilton I usually stay at whilst working in London as this really is something else.
The room was spotless, modern and had more than what you’d expect. I dined in the rooftop bar and from arrival to departure the service was attentive but not intrusive, drinks well presented and the food was absolutely to die for!
I didn’t avail of breakfast the morning after my stay due to an early meeting but I woke refreshed and had an amazing nights sleep.
There really is a point of difference with Curio Hilton’s, they obtain their sense of individuality with the marketing benefit Hilton brings and I for sure would love to see more of them.
This will most definitely not be my last stay at The Trafalgar St James, I can’t wait to return!",5,2022,03,20
145,Fantastic stay in an unbeatable London location!,"My mom, aunt, and I visited for a girls trip in early March. Not only was the hotel location perfect (right in Trafalgar Square - walking distance to everything!), but the hotel staff were courteous, kind, and incredibly helpful. Housekeeping visited the room often and kept the room well stocked with everything we needed and wanted. The room (a family suite) was incredibly comfortable and plenty spacious for three adults. The blackout curtains were fabulous and helped us quickly recover from jet lag with a dark, peaceful night’s sleep. Can’t wait to return!",5,2022,03,18

Absolutely fantastic room, modern tablet and tv with everything included - as well as cognac! Staff here are what set it apart (nick I believe) on front desk was exceptional.

It was quite the needed haven from the busy Trafalgar Square . Just turning the corner onto Springs Garden was an ahhhh moment with a constant greeting from nice doorman. Rooms were quiet and dark with water, coffee and tea.",5,2022,03,11
145,Amazing,"Room was spacious, really impressive on first impressions and it followed through with having everything that we needed. Location is brilliant and breakfast was good (great manager).

145,London family visit,"Angelo and the team did a fantastic job of looking after us and we had a wonderful stay. We had a minor issue prior to check-in, but it was dealt with in a very pro-active manner. The location is excellent, but the service was even better. Well done! ",5,2022,02,27
145,An outstanding hotel by Trafalgar Square!,"This is an outstanding hotel and our stay here, to celebrate a birthday, could not have been better.  I’d never heard of the hotel (I live in London), nor seen it in forays around Trafalgar Square.  I’m a member of the Hilton Honors programme; and  it came up as an option  in that search when I was looking for a suitable hotel in Central London.  It’s a part of Hilton’s ‘Curio Collection'.  The 'Curio Collection by Hilton' is an upscale hotel brand within the Hilton Worldwide portfolio. 'Curio Collection' is a soft brand, meaning its hotels are supported by Hilton, but retain their own individual branding.  Hence the Trafalgar St James Hotel, rather than  the  Hilton Trafalgar St James Hotel, with no visible  'Hilton' branding or signage.  However, membership of the Hilton Honors programme is honoured, with points awarded.

Here's my comments on our stay.

LOCATION:  The hotel has a fantastic location, directly opposite Trafalgar Square and the Canada House.  Note, however, that not all rooms will have views of Trafalgar Square.  We had chosen a St James King  Room, a corner room on the corne front of the hotel on Cockspur Street / Trafalgar Square and Spring Gardens, and the view across Trafalgar Square is probably the best view of the Square you will get from a hotel room.  Charing Cross is the nearest underground and main line station, but it’s also close to Leicester Square underground if you are coming in from Heathrow. Covent Garden, Leicester Square and Chinatown are at your doorstep, as are St James’s Park and The Mall. 

ROOM.  Our room was very spacious, superbly appointed, and spotlessly clean.  It’s done in a very stylish, contemporary and elegant style, decorated with some interesting pieces of modern art.  It worked well.  The room had all the amenities we needed:  an iron and board, security safe, good WiFi connectivity, and a very comfortable king bed.  Added bonuses were complementary bottled water and sodas in the fridge, and a pod coffee maker.  The bathroom was of a decent size (no bath tub) with Molton Brown toiletries.  There were plenty of USB ports for charging devices, including ports and sockets at the bedside tables (a rarity!). The view across Trafalgar Square and to the National Gallery and St Martin-in-the-Fields church was lovely from the tall window of  our third floor corner room.  It’s back to hustle and bustle on the streets, but the room was soundproofed and very quiet.  It was a shame the windows didn’t open.

FACILITIES:  We visited the rooftop bar after dinner; Reception staff secured the reservation for us.  We sat on the outside terrace, under cover and with heating and blankets, and enjoyed some drinks.  The views across Trafalgar Square and the wider  London skyline to the London Eye  were beautiful.  Drinks were a bit pricy but that was expected; the rooftop bar was busy but service was efficient.  Breakfast was included in our hotel deal, and it too was excellent, served in the beautifully appointed restaurant beside the reception area.  The breakfast buffet was excellent, with a huge range of well-cooked hot breakfast items including waffles and pancakes, as well as all the cereals, pastries and continental items you would expect in a hotel of this calibre.  In addition, there was an additional range of prepared breakfast dishes such as Eggs Benedict and Eggs Royale from an additional menu.  I was impressed with the quality of the food.  We were served decent barista-style coffee.  Service during breakfast was attentive and efficient. 

SERVICE:  Staff were welcoming, courteous, respectful and cheerful.  Check-in was efficient, and the Reception staff were helpful with the reservation for the rooftop bar.  Breakfast service staff were very attentive without being obtrusive. 

This is an excellent hotel and I recommend it fully.",5,2022,02,24
145,Fabulous,"Stayed in the Barry Suite and it was fabulous. The staff were welcoming and friendly and more than happy to help - nothing was too much trouble. The room was amazing (I especially liked the Molton Brown products in the bathroom!) , and the hotel’s central location is perfect. Will definitely be staying again. Thank you!",5,2022,02,23
145,The best place to stay in London,"This hotel is perfectly located, extremely clean and comfortable and has the kindest staff. The rooms are roomy for London and beds are very comfortable.  The concierge group is outstanding!   And the rooftop bar should not be missed!  ",5,2022,02,22
145,Week with the family,"The moment we arrived we were greeted by the Concierge Michael who help us with our bags and check in. All the staff were polite and helpful, they all made us feel very welcomed. The rooms were very spacious and our children loved that they each had a queen double to sleep in in the interconnecting room. The bathrooms were clean a big especially the bath. The best thing ever according to our children were the waffles and pancakes for breakfast!!!! And the eggs Benedict weren’t bad either. We will definitely stay here again and I can’t recommend it enough. ",5,2022,02,21
145,From Arrival To Departure The Trafalgar St James Is 5 ⭐️,"Over the years I have stayed in some lovely hotels in London (recently The Savoy & The Goring) After my recent 2night stay at The Trafalgar it has become my favourite London hotel. 
From arrival to departure everything was perfect. 
First of all the location is perfect. You are central for all the main attractions in London. 
When we arrived we were warmly greeted ( as we were each time we left or came back) by the lovely Wilfredo. 
All the reception team were so very friendly & welcoming, even giving us a nice room upgrade, they also ensured we had secured a booking in the rooftop bar. 
The hotel is a very modern with modern decor throughout. The friendliness remained throughout our stay, seeming genuinely interested in what we’d been doing. 
Our room was very large with views out onto Trafalgar Square. A nice comfy sofa that can be made up into a bed. Impeccably clean room & bathroom with everything you need for an enjoyable stay. Nice comfy bathrobes & a good powerful hairdryer. 
Bed was nice & comfortable meaning a good nights sleep. 
There is nothing more they could do to improve the hotel. It is fabulous in every aspect. 
Can’t wait to revisit.",5,2022,02,18
145,Excellent Hotel!,"What a great hotel! We stayed on a Saturday and when we got there we had lunch in the sun on the rooftop bar overlooking Trafalgar Square. Food was decent and the view was great. In the evening we went to a show near Piccadilly Circus which was 5mins walk at best so you can't fault the central location (it's only 2mins from Charing Cross too).

Staff at the hotel are so helpful and friendly, the beds are comfy, decor throughout is nice and we used room service for breakfast which only took about 25mins and was delicious.

Nice little touches too....Molton Brown miniatures in the bathroom, a complimentary mini bar in the room with soft drinks, and in the evening when we went out, we got back to find that they had popped in and made the bed again!

All in all, I would definitely rate this place :-)",5,2022,02,15
145,Exceptional hotel and location,"This hotel and its staff were incredible. The rooms were comfortable and generous.   The location was central.   But the staff, front desk and concierge, were exceptional.  They treated us like important guests,  and we departed feeling like friends.   They were thoughtful with their recommendations,  and helped us prepare when the streets were closing around the hotel for a race.  My highest recommendation to this place.  I will return here on my next trip to London.  You can't get a better recommendation than that.",5,2022,02,15
145,Fantastic experience,"Loved our time at this hotel,everything about it was fantastic from the staff to the beautiful clean spacious room if I had to say a negative I would say please make it so the windows in the rooms open as the room was quite hot.
The breakfast was plentiful however some of the items could have been hotter but was still good quality.
Will definitely stay here again",5,2022,02,14
145,"Such a great hotel! An amazing breakfast, perfect location inthe heart of soho.  Definitely will come again..","Such a great hotel! An amazing breakfast, perfect location inthe heart of soho. 
The service, the wifi, the bar at the top all was just amazing and couldnt expected for better. I will definitely come again..",5,2022,02,13
145,Never disappoints,"Another wonderful stay in this establishment. 

Great food, exceptional service and great quality rooms. Very clean which has been ever so important over the last couple of years.

Frankly, this hotel outperforms most Hiltons, and even many of those that are marketed as higher 'quality'.

Special thanks to Angelo for exceptional customer service.",5,2022,02,10
145,Little gem,"Part of the Hilton Group, but far from being ""a Hilton"". This hotel has well appointed rooms that are not the biggest in London but are more than adequate and the modern bathroom are spacy. We stayed several times and would suggest not booking the cheapest rooms which can be smaller and facing inwards.

All the staff on our visits are super helpful and for us the location right on Trafalgar Square is perfect for the west end ",5,2022,02,02
145,Another Theatre Visit!,"My wife and I were back in London at the weekend to go see Jersey Boys at the Trafalgar Theatre and this time we decided to stay over. I booked the Trafalgar St James because of it’s proximity to the Trafalgar Theatre - just five minutes door to door - and I couldn’t have picked a better hotel for our stay. The staff were welcoming and helpful, the rooms spacious and comfortable, the food delicious, the decor contemporary and the views over Trafalgar Square and down towards the London Eye just breath taking. We thoroughly enjoyed our stay at the Trafalgar St James and I would highly recommend the hotel if you are planning a stay in London.",5,2022,01,31
145,Fab location and service!,From arrival we were made to feel so welcome by everyone we met. Its one of those hotels where nothing is a problem and everything is possible. The service was absolutely faultless! The Rooftop bar was so much fun too! Location is also amazing! Highly recommend and will return here regularly.,5,2022,01,31
145,Elegant and comfortable,"Only a brief business visit, but a beautiful and friendly hotel to stay in. The room was spacious and elegantly designed with Molton Brown amenities. The bed was very comfortable with plenty of pillows. The breakfast was vast and of superb quality. I would definitely return.",5,2022,01,28
145,Perfect place to stay,To start the hotel is in a perfect location in London. Walking distance to almost everything. The rooms were great and very clean everyday. All that is great for whatever you may be doing in London but what sets this hotel above and beyond was the staff. Everyone was extremely nice and helpful. The concierge’s were like your personal assistants for your stay in London. You didn’t have to seek them out. They’d see you in the lobby in the morning and ask what you had planned for the day. As you told them they would be booking things for you and getting reservations for you at restaurants for later that evening. I literally can’t say enough about these people. Absolutely amazing staff. Excellent experience at the hotel all the way around. ,5,2022,01,25
145,Excellent stay,"Our experience at this hotel was amazing! I booked a surprise stay for 2 nights for my boyfriends 40th birthday. They allowed me to have some balloons delivered to the hotel prior to our arrival and kindly placed this in our room along with a complementary birthday cake (which tasted delicious) and a birthday card. Our room was spacious and clean with a huge comfy bed. 
The location of this hotel is perfect as it’s close to many theatres and restaurants.
The staff went above and beyond to make our stay perfect and allowed us to check out later when requested.
The breakfast buffet was a highlight for us, they served fresh food which tasted amazing.
I would like to say a huge thank you to Lucian (Guest Relations Manager) who answered all my queries regarding ballon decoration for the room.
I will definitely be coming to stay here again in future and recommend this hotel for couples.
Thank you to all the staff at The Trafalgar St James!",5,2022,01,22
145,Location and Comfort - excellent,"Perfect location, excellent size and appointment of rooms. Comfy bed, crisp white linen, quiet rooms (triple glazed). Ticks most boxes. Roof garden bar/restaurant excellent 
Being able to walk most places is a huge plus too.  Would I stay again - Yes. Would I recommend - yes. 
Improvements, a few more coat hangers in the room would be good, but a minor thing",5,2022,01,18
145,Birthday trip,"Such a beautiful hotel & the location is everything. My boyfriend and I were able to walk pretty much everywhere! Room was amazing and super clean. The staff was also very helpful, I needed a last minute Covid test for my return home and our concierge knew exactly where to direct me.",5,2022,01,11
145,Excellent on all levels,Excellent quality hotel. Soft beds. Premium quality fittings. Large space. Complimentary drinks in the room really made the stay feel like my own home. Excellent and friendly service. Couldn’t ask for more. ,5,2022,01,02
145,Wonderful stay,This hotel is so lovely. We had a fantastic room (room 415) with lots of space and a raised area that worked so well for the pull out sofa bed. I stayed with my two sons and it was near to perfect  (aged 15 and 13). I am actually struggling to find fault. Went out to the theatre and came back and water was left on our bedsides with slippers - such a nice touch. Perfect central location - on a bus tour they in fact said it was the centre of London! Usually have to use the tube lots when staying in London but could easily walk everywhere. Would definitely stay again.,5,2021,12,22
145,Loved this hotel!,"I stayed at this hotel for 5 nights in December 2021. This hotel went above and beyond to make the stay amazing. Every employee I came in contact with was nice and helpful! I am a diamond member, and they took such great care of me!! I got a room upgrade with a view of the square. They sent up birthday treats, and the restaurant manager came up to me at the breakfast the next day to personally ask how they were. The breakfast buffet was good, and the a la cart options were delicious as well, nothing bad to say about the food! This hotel location is also perfect for hoping on a tour bus, walking to Buckingham ham or Big Ben. It is in the perfect location. I will stay here every time I go to London!",5,2021,12,19
145,The perfect experience!,"We stayed last night as a family of three with a 7yo child. Our visit was an absolute delight from start to finish but i’d like to reference three areas. 
1) Staff - From Wilfredo at the door, to the waiting staff on the roof, each member of staff was just wonderful. Each interaction was positive, helpful and done with a smile on their face. They made time to chat to us and nothing was too much trouble. As i’m sure they know, the staff are their best asset. 
2) Location - perfectly located in Trafalger square, there is so much nearby! We did most things on foot from Big Ben, the London Eye, Covent garden and much more. Although the hotel is central, the hotel doesn’t suffer from noise. An ideal spot!
3) Room/amenities - The room was perfect for us! A gorgeous view across the square which was so lovely with the Christmas lights. The room was spacious, clean and modern. The bathroom was spotless and a good size with a high end finish. My son had the sofa bed on a raised area by the window, he loved having his own space. Now, the real treat was the roof top. We went up on a chilly night but the roof was covered and there were blankets available. We ordered a few small dishes and some wine - everything we ordered was stunning! So, so tasty! To be able to enjoy a few small plates with the view across the city was such a treat, a really special experience. We could see the square, shard, winter wonderland, the london eye and much more with the Christmas lights. 
Will we return? Yes! Do we recommend to others? Yes! Thank you so much to all who added to our visit. 
Pete, Sara & Jack.",5,2021,12,18
145,Delightful,"Lovely luxurious touches as you would expect. Nice note and chocolates from the duty manger as we are diamond Honors members. Lovely breakfast selection, apple muffins and fresh hot breakfast items off the menu very nice. Lovely turndown service.",5,2021,12,12
145,Great location and very friendly comfortable place,Stayed for two weeks on a trip and spent a lot of time in room. Housekeeping is amazing and staff is super friendly. Room is moderate sized and very comfortable. Location of hotel is fantastic but is not noisy at all.,5,2021,12,11
145,No drop in service here!,"This was my 5th stay at the Trafalgar St. James, which ought to be enough of a recommendation given all of the fantastic hotels in London.  You can read plenty about the great location and helpful staff in other reviews.  However, I would like to focus on the fact that at a time when most hotel services and benefits are being cut due to understaffing or cost cuts, the TSJ was every bit as fabulous as always.  The full hotel breakfast bar was delicious.  Daily room cleaning and turn-down service was was impeccable.  We even had a call to make sure everything was perfect for our stay.  I cannot sing the praises of the TSJ and its staff enough.  It definitely won't be our last stay!",5,2021,12,11
145,Amazing place and staff 👏👏,"It was an amazing time we spent in London and this hotel was a plus. It has the perfect location for couples who wants enjoy every day in London. The roof top lounge has a great view, ambiance and food varieties. ",5,2021,12,05
145,First class service,"We received a first class service at this hotel. All staff we encountered were polite and friendly, and we felt valued as customers.

The hotel is in an excellent location, opposite Trafalgar Square and a few minutes walk from Charing Cross underground. Our room was of a high standard. There was a good choice of quality food at breakfast. We highly recommend at stay at this hotel.",5,2021,12,05
145,Absolutely amazing!!!,Such an amazing place.. service was 5+. The drinks were perfect. We had garlic bread and curly fries from the snack menu which were spot on. Everything was perfect. The views are amazing. Thankyou rooftop Trafalgar Square!!! You made my wife’s birthday very special.,5,2021,12,04
145,Fantastic return visit to Hotel,"Return visit to hotel for a pre birthday visit to London. Fabulous  location situated on Trafalgar Square enabling us to walk most places without having to go on the Underground.
Greeted at the entrance by the lovely smiling and helpful doorman Wilfredo and received great customer service when we checked in by the very efficient Laura.
Allocated a large and spacious room which was spotlessly clean. Housekeeping did a great job coming in everyday to replenish the toiletries, provided clean towels and kept the water and soft drinks well stocked up. They even provided a turn down service and acknowledged by birthday by providing me with a birthday cake in the room which was a very welcome treat.
Enjoyed a cocktail in the Rooftop Bar with great views over London. Didn’t have an evening meal in the hotel but had a substantial breakfast every morning in the lovely decorated Rockwell restaurant . The breakfast hostess was very efficient and was always able to seat us by the window so we could watch the world go by overlooking Trafalgar Square. 
Such a great hotel with such great staff. Looking forward to visiting again when I am next in London .",5,2021,12,04
145,Wonderful hotel,"Our room was fabulous, big, spacious with a bath and separate shower. The bed was so comfy I didn’t want to get out of it! It is so quiet here you don’t hear a thing no door slamming or voices in the corridor. Customer service is outstanding I had a minor issue and it was handled so professionally and with empathy by a lovely receptionist called Mathilda, she greeted us everyday smiling and asking if we were enjoying our stay.  Housekeeping do an excellent job with the cleanliness of the room and so good to have them coming in each day.  The staff are smiley happy and greet you everywhere you go from the lovely doorman to all the staff at breakfast.  The staff at Hilton Trafalgar are a credit to the Hilton brand.
Well done and thank you for a great stay.  Look forward to staying again next year.",5,2021,11,28
145,Back to London!,"So strange to be back in London after nearly two years. I've been in Spain and my life has changed. Strangely I've lost the ability to join my favourite parts of London together. OK I'm in the Groucho - how do I get to my hotel Trafalgar St James? Just a 24 hour thing and I'm back on course, knowing how the city works. I arrived from Gatwick to a hotel I've never been to before. And what a welcome! The people on the front desk took pity on a guy clearly out of his depth. I'd already bonded with the doorman who'd helped me out of the taxi, understood that I hadn't time to go to my room and assured me he'd sort everything out. I had a meeting to go to. Returned a bit later and all had been sorted. Like in the movies. Up to my room - fantastic view of old Nelson on his column. Tough day - meeting was with my financial advisor - I needed a drink. Up to the Roof Top Bar. This is genius! It's autumn in London but they have a roof, blankets and heaters. And a view to die for. It's buzzing, lots of post-office chat and a bit of not so obvious flirting going on. God this is good! I've been up for hours so maybe just one too many white wines and I'm back in that room. Kiss Nelson goodnight and snuggle down in my bed. What a day and what a place. Now my favourite refuge in London",5,2021,11,24
145,Fantastic in every way,"Fantastic hotel fantastic location fantastic staff we loved our stay roof top bar well worth a visit the breakfast was very good

145,Lovely Stay.,"This hotel is well situated close to all if the attractions, our family room was clean and comfortable, the breakfast was lovely plenty of choices plus a menu to order from, prices in the bar are high but you expect this in the middle of London, I would stop in this hotel again.",5,2021,11,21
145,Amazing,Everything was perfect. Super friendly staff and super clean place. Dinner at the rooftop was amazing and had great food and drinks. Everyone that worked at the hotel we encountered was super friendly and inviting. ,5,2021,11,13
145,Awesome stay!!,"This hotel is amazing!!  Staff was very friendly and every request we had was met and taken care of for us.  Breakfast was wonderful with so many options.  With that being said, do not bother with the rooftop restaurant.  Service was terrible, food was expensive and not great (my salad looked like it was made with days old lettuce) and the drinks were small and super expensive.  Go there only for the view and just to look, the rest of it is not worth it.",5,2021,11,09
145,Excellent hotel,"This is an excellent hotel. The staff are very professional, friendly and very attentive.  The rooms are excellent, high quality with a small amount of complementary items. The breakfast was fantastic. Very highly recommended.",5,2021,11,07
145,Romantic night in London,"What a lovely hotel! We chose this hotel for a night in London because of location and its rooftop bar. It didn't disappoint on either! Great location being only minutes from Leicester Sq, picadilly, haymarket and Buck House. Staff were all very friendly and helpful and the room was ready early. We had booked just a Trafalgar King room but it was spacious and had all we needed. We will definitely be staying again!",5,2021,11,07
145,Tasty cocktails and beautiful rooftop bar,"Beautiful recommendation and a pleasant evening enjoying cocktails. Beautiful rooftop bar! Lovely staff too. Next time I would go for food too. 
The decor is lovely too and they have blankets if your cold too. 
Highly recommend this rooftop bar if in London.",5,2021,11,05
145,Great to be back!,"Yet another excellent stay at our preferred hotel. Great location for access to theatres, museums and all main London attractions. We have seen a number of changes in the 15+ years we have stayed here, some good, some not so, nut this stay was excellent. The staff were welcoming and friendly.  The room was spacious (King) and all the amenities you could want. The breakfast was very comprehensive and the hot buffet was cooked beautifully. 
Thanks Hilton Team, see you again soon🙂",5,2021,11,04
145,Just perfect,We had a weekend booked to see some sights of London and see a show. This hotel is in a perfect location for everything we wanted/needed. Hotel was spotless and the staff were extremely helpful and friendly. Great breakfast choices and William the restaurant Manager was a true gentleman. I would definitely stay here again and recommend to friends.,5,2021,10,31
145,Wish I could have stayed longer!,"Stayed here 1 night on a business trip. Wish I stayed longer! Great room with large tv, Molton Brown toiletries, and a large second level which was a nice space to leave all my clothes and case. 

Breakfast is delightful, and all staff very friendly. Would defo stay here if you’re planning a London trip.",5,2021,10,30
145,A really mixed bag,"Bit of a strange one to be honest. Fabulous in parts, seriously lacking in parts. I'd checked in online to get the digikey so we could avoid Reception check-in. That didn't happen. No worries particularly. Got to the room and as we are a family we're using the sofa bed so it was cramped and wow, that sofa bed is unbelievably uncomfortable. Wonderful big bath and Molton Brown toiletries etc. Bathrobes, slippers. Coffee machine. All lovely and greatly appreciated. We went out to a show and on returning, decided we'd have a drink in the bar. Table service we were assured. We waited ... and waited.... and waited and after half an hour just gave up and returned to our room. When we got up to the room we discovered there had been a sort of semi turndown service. A lovely bottle of mineral water and tumbler had been placed on each side of the main bed which was lovely. The poor sod roughing it on the lumpy sofa bed didn't get one but hey ho, they were going to have a lousy night's sleep anyway. The corridors are dark. Moody in intention I guess, dingy in practice. I love Hilton hotels. I'm an Honors member and stsy in them whenever I can. I'd like to see more emphasis on large scale comfort, as the small scale consideration is all there. I'd like a decent family room with proper beds for three (our daughter is disabled so we do all need to share), service in the bar, lights in the corridor (it feels like emergency lighting) and a wholehearted turndown. ",3,2021,10,29
145,Fantastic Hotel,"We have just returned from staying at this hotel for the first time. We usually stay in another brand close-by. We were very impressed. The rooms are spacious with a large bathroom and very clean. 
The location is perfect, weigh Trafalgar Square opposite and the Mall to the rear. The staff are very welcoming and professional. Would definitely stay here again.",5,2021,10,27
145,Excellent hotel,"Great location, great staff, wonderful experience.  This is a perfect place to stay to catch the metro, walk in the park or to the sights, you are in the middle of it all.  The staff is exceptional, perfect experience.",5,2021,10,25
145,Family break,"Very central location for family activities. Given the location of the hotel the bedrooms were extremely well insulated for sound and the family bedroom was spacious, clean and well maintained. Very pleasant staff.",5,2021,10,24
145,Best location.  Best service.  Welcoming smiles.  Stunning view from the roof top bar.,"This is our go to hotel in London before covid and therefore so happy to return for a visit this week. 

Nothing has changed apart from being perfect.  I told them we are celebrating our 30th anniversary and they left a cake and card on our first night.  Great surprise.  Love the small touch.  

The room is as usual very spacious for a London hotel.  Location is just perfect and what I can say about the roof top bar.  Stunning. 

Love this hotel.  Keep up with the great service.  Hope to be back soon",5,2021,10,15
145,Great all round experience,"An all round great experience. Staff: efficient, friendly and helpful, nothing too much trouble.

145,My Wife's Review  (in the dog house),"Don’t stay here!! Ever! If you need a quiet night In to just to chill , have a glass of wine and watch a movie. …… NOT an option “!!! no movies !!! So if you are sight seeing london and fancy a relax in your room , this is not the hotel for you ! even though it is right next to trafagur square .",2,2021,10,11
145,Sunday 'Brunch ',"A dozen members of our family enjoyed a very good breakfast/ brunch at this great location. William was extremely efficient, helpful and affable in ensuring our party, including three children, were happy and well looked after.",5,2021,10,10
145,London Marathon Runcation,Location was excellent. The staff was consistently friendly and accommodating. Housekeeping did a fairly good job and checked up on us to make sure we had everything we needed. Overall great stay and will come back. I was given free transport to hotel from airport for compensation of car service faux pas on our next visit.,5,2021,10,06
145,great stay in london,"first time stay in london really nice rooms and lovely public areas , rockwell for  breakfast was our favourite with a touch of glamour , staff all friendly and welcoming ,close to lots of fantastic places to dine the pub across the road (admiralty) is also worth a look in for a drink or sandwich, stayed three nights which is not really enough, a good find and reasonable value as well look forward to coming back.",5,2021,10,05
145,Excellent,"Excellent hotel, great location. We really enjoyed our stay. Trafalgar king room. Staff are very welcoming and helpful, particularly Josie and Adrian at the front desk. I would stay again in future when I visit London. Breakfast was great too.",5,2021,10,05

145,Care on concern if the staff is a 15 on a chart of 1-10!!!  Incredible location and views!,"I have written two rave reviews of the kind and exceptional help we received especially from the concierge staff and front desk!  But somehow I cannot find the suit button.  Great people, wonderful breakfasts, sheets feel like satin because if high thread content.",5,2021,10,03
145,Wonderful hotel!,"Having stayed in many hotels in London for both my work interests and personally I would say this is now my first choice. Location for exploring London on foot couldn’t be better. 
Spacious, airy,  beautifully, decorated rooms with all the mod cons you could need & comfy beds!
We were offered a turndown service and fresh towels the evening we arrived.
Our Hilton Honours membership was noted with a thoughtful card and a plate of delicious hand made chocolates. 
A small but opulent breakfast room served a great breakfast. 
The rooftop terrace has spectacular views across the city. 
Reception staff were welcoming and attentive, as were the management team when we encountered a little issue on the rooftop terrace.",5,2021,09,28
145,Nic,"Nice hotell at premium location, top standard in all aspects. Interior is one of the best i have seen, photoart of great interest. Rooftop on a sunny say is breathtaking and worth a visit. Front desk is +++++",5,2021,09,25
145,Rooftop bar,"Visited with my friend and the service was impeccable. Our introduction to the establishment was nothing other than a warm welcoming smile. We were served by Radaha who was quick, friendly and his high energy made us feel familiar as if we were locals. Alison also served us who was so friendly and so welcoming she made a conversation.
Would deffo visit again without a doubt.
Please pass on the good praise to the relevant staff!",5,2021,09,18
145,Corporate Drinks Reception for 120 VIP Guests,"We had our first corporate event this year at the Trafalgar Roof Top bar.  The venue is stunning and lends itself to panoramic views of the city at night. The staff were exceptional from the meet and greet at the reception to the staff that managed our event and ran the function on the evening.  Our guests were extremely impressed and it made for a very 'classy' event.  Special mention to the events team Andra and her team on the night Jack and Dennis (Chef). as well as the friendly service team on the night.  Thank you for such a brilliant evening.  So good to be meeting people again face to face and the ambience, and vibe of venue made for a very successful event. Thank you from Cripps Sears",5,2021,09,17
145,Makes Life Feel Sweet!,"My experience at this hotel was fantastic. Prior to arriving, all of my correspondence was replied to promptly and I really appreciated the HHonors App which enabled me to request an upgrade at discounted price. I also liked that I was able to select my own room for my stay - wonderful! Thus I opted for a very nice Double Queen room on the third floor with partial view of Trafalgar Square and the Nelsons Column. The room was perfectly appointed and the beds were sumptuously comfortable. Room amenities were of a good quality and the room/hotel felt spotlessly clean in all areas (so the housekeeping team are doing amazingly well and especially so in these current times). The staff on the front desk were extremely warm, attentive and professional and made us feel very welcome indeed. The lady who checked us in was just lovely and made a fantastic impression right from our first moment arriving. This is always so important and I’m genuinely sorry we didn’t get her name. The Rooftop bar has spectacular views over the London Eye, The Shard, Trafalgar Square and Westminster etc. It’s a pleasure to frequent both day and night (and we were fortunate to get a reservation on the day of arrival but definitely recommend that you make reservations in advance if you can). Breakfast was of very good quality and there was sufficient choice to suit most tastes. The selection is perhaps not as wide and varied as you might find in larger five star hotels. However, this did not detract from a good experience and I really enjoyed having my breakfast watching all the red buses going past the window - and the waffles, too, were delicious! The superiority of the location goes without saying and you really are within a 5-10 min walk of the main tourist attractions in London. For those you can’t walk to, tube connections are extremely close by and will get you there quickly. If you are in any wonderment as to whether there is a hotel in London which meets all the needs of comfort, style and service and which enables you to feel in the very heart and buzz of the city, then I can say for certain that The Trafalgar St James is the one. It was lovely to lay my head down on the pillow at night, with the very busy Trafalgar Square on the doorstep (minimal noise unless, of course, you chose to have your window open - as I did). When in London… ❤️
I will very much look forward to a return in the near future.",5,2021,09,15
145,"Three years ago great, now a complete waste of money","Used to love this place, once wrote an email to Hilton's CEO to tell him how well it was run - staff so friendly and kind and concerned to get it right.  

Now, it must be under different management.  

Went into bar at 22.30 on Tuesday; they had laid up for breakfast, and I was told it was closed and to get a drink from in my room.  Told by Room Service I could have bottled beer or wine.  Cheeky for GBP 365/ night room. My last night in a HIlton, unless I really can't avoid it.",1,2021,09,14
145,Excellent,"My third stay at this hotel. Exceedingly clean, great staff and location. Staff were always nice and available for any questions. The cleaning service was top notch. They always stocked our fridge. Wonderful!",5,2021,09,12
145,Weekend Stay,"Stayed for a Saturday and Sunday a couple of weeks ago and found the hotel to be very nice and in a great location.  Room's were clean and service was great.  Only issue we had was with the bar on Saturday night.  Couldn't get a late drink as it was closed for a private function, which was very disappointing.  Overall though, would stay here again, no problem.",4,2021,09,08
145,Good hotel - bad service,"Lovely hotel and location and the rooms are good standard.   Just be wary of booking the rooftop bar / restaurant.  We booked for a family gathering 2 months in advance and received a phone call 4 days before our stay to say the whole of the rooftop bar and restaurant were now being used for a private function and they had cancelled our reservations. No apology, no call from anyone senior in the hotel despite my request. So great rooms but abysmal service",4,2021,09,07
145,Amazing,Just stayed for the weekend. The room was excellent along with all the staff. The roof top bar and restaurant were amazing but remember you need to book ahead. Would recommend this hotel for your stay ,5,2021,09,07
145,Amazing Hotel,"We came to the hotel for one nights stay to celebrate my sisters 30th birthday and I couldn’t be happier with our choice. The staff were so accommodating and friendly, the hotel was beautiful, bedroom spotless, beds so cosy and the room terrace dinner and drinks were an absolute dream. The view was stunning! 
We also included breakfast in our stay and there was so much variety and it was delicious.
I will definitely be returning, I can’t fault this hotel.",5,2021,09,07
145,Amazing!,I stayed at the hotel for the first time and travelled to london on my own. The staff were really friendly and made me feel welcome on arrival. I also found my room was a bit messy with a hair and bits on the floor and i was upgraded to a top floor room with a view of trafalgar square and was given snacks and a drink as an apology. ,5,2021,09,02
145,Great location!!!,"Great location to get around and amazing views from the roof top bar. 5* service and hospitality, making us feel special. The breakfast which was included was a good choice and plenty more to order at a price should you need to! Clean hotel throughout would happily stay again",5,2021,09,02
145,Amazing Location,"Couldn’t of dreamed of a better hotel we were a family of 4 with kids 3&6years old, i thought the hotel would be geared toward older clientele but the staff were amazing and the location was brilliant within walking distance of so many of the main attractions. Recommend!!",5,2021,09,02
145,Perfect stay,"I stayed at this hotel on two separate occasions over August and could not fault on either visit, location great and staff brilliant would definitely return. Staff make you feel extremely welcome and friendly ",5,2021,09,01
145,Superb,"Absolutely amazing hotel. Gorgeous rooms, excellent staff, great breakfast and superb location.  This hotel ticks every single box. This hotel has fantastic attention to detail, and with  check in/ check out via their app it’s so convenient. We can’t wait to  come back!!!",5,2021,08,28
145,Ms A,"Unfortunately the staff forgot to clean our room, so when we got back from our excursions of the day, we had to wait for an hour before someone came and it was cleaned. 
The kettle for boiling water for tea is very dangerous. It is porcelain and very heavy. The lid spout and body overheat so you burn yourself! Not practical at all!

We had building work going on outside our window. So it was very noisy at 8 am in the morning. 

No social distancing during buffet breakfast. No disposable gloves provided when helping oneself to breakfast.",2,2021,08,28
145,Lovely service and atmosphere,"Lovely food and lovely, friendly service. Giacomo was especially very attentive and his team was also very hospitable! Will definitely visit again. Do keep it up! The food menu could have a few more choices but everything we had was delicious!",5,2021,08,26
145,Lovely hotel.,"Very friendly staff ,quick and easy check in.  Hotel was spotless  felt very safe . Breakfast was a little expensive but worth it. .our visit to the rooftop bar was amazing and the staff up there were excellent.   We visited the hotel as a family treat ,our group included grandparents ,parents a child and two teenagers and it was perfect for everyone.  Ideal locations to visit all the sights.  Will use this hotel again.",5,2021,08,22
145,Drinks with a view,"Booked a table at The Rooftop. It’s a very nice setting, quite small outside but with lovely views across London. Only had drinks and booked a table outside for 4.30pm so wasn’t sure if the minimum spend after 5pm would be applied but it was not.  Nice service and good cocktails.",5,2021,08,22
145,Lovely hotel with friendly staff,"I was in London for an evening theatre show and decided to make a longer day of it. So we booked the rooftop for a lunchtime bite before check-in.

From the moment we walked in (slightly tight for time for the lunch booking) the staff were super friendly. They had a room available early, got us checked-in quickly, explained where to go for the rooftop reminding us to make an evening booking if required.

These are minor details you expect but it’s the friendly and efficient nature. It helped make the stay calm from the first moment, answering questions before I even asked.

Rooftop is usual London prices but food is well presented and has a nice ambience and friendly staff everywhere. This just continued our relaxed experience and I can recommend it.

I’d stay here again in a heartbeat, if you twisted my arm to give constructive feedback, I’d say the cutlery.  I’m being very picky here but the entire hotel seems to run on business class airplane knifes, the kind that look like small butter knifes without any teeth. 

This was not a problem for the rooftop tapas style food we had, squid aside. But for the Rockwell, It definitely encouraged me to have a healthier portion from the buffet breakfast. Maybe I missed other knifes but I looked and never saw anything with a cutting edge. 

This does not lower my high opinion of the hotel though, just a quirk I noticed. ",5,2021,08,21
145,Wonderful stay,"Spent the weekend here and had a truly wonderful time. The hotel is beautiful, very clean and has a lovely ambiance. Breakfast was lovely with lots of choice. The team were all so professional a real credit to the hotel nothing was to much trouble. We ate in the roof top Terence which is a must if you stay the food is lovely and the views are amazing. Hotels location is perfect as there is so much within easy reach with a short walk or really close to the tube. We will be back in 2022",5,2021,08,16
145,Fabulous hotel! Can’t rate it high enough 😊,"Excellent central location within walking distance to tube, rooms were spacious and really clean - shower amazing! Delicious breakfast and great coffee. Staff couldn’t have been nicer - attentive and nothing too much trouble. Roof top terrace bar is a must, fabulous London view over dinner and cocktails, what more could you ask for? Thank you to all for a truly enjoyable stay. Highly recommend.",5,2021,08,14
145,Fabulous  time,"Stayed here for one night on a girly trip to London. There is nothing I can fault about this hotel. The location was spot on, the  rooms are beautiful, extremely clean and have everything you need. The Molton Brown products are a lovely touch.too.
All the staff are very pleasant and extremely helpful especially Abdul. Although we didn’t eat at the hotel we did go to the rooftop bar for several drinks which was beautiful despite the weather not being amazing. All in all a lovely stay and I would thoroughly recommend this hotel to anyone.",5,2021,08,13
145,Love this hotel. First choice in London,"Been here a couple of times and always love it here.

Brilliant location. 
Only niggle is the air conditioning doesn't seem to get that cold.

Will definitely come back again.",5,2021,08,13

145,Outstanding,"Everything was perfect! The hotel was beautifully decorated, exceptionally clean and the staff were always eager to meet the needs of their guests!
Would highly recommend to anyone staying in central London",5,2021,08,12
145,Prepare to have your expectations exceeded...... and more !,"This is simply the best hotel in central London.The staff welcome you like long lost friends, and the rooms and facilities are without parallel.Brilliant, stylish decor and rooms so quiet, you can hear the ice melting in your cocktails.
Talking of which, a visit to the tooftop restaurant, is a must.Book early to avoid disappointment - really.

Go and enjoy this fabulous hotel !",5,2021,08,11
145,Stunning,"Had stayed here years ago with our two sons but this time was just for us celebrating my birthday.  I can quite honestly say that from the moment you step over the threshold you are made to feel welcome and special.

The hotel sits right on Trafalgar Square so is in an excellent position for exploring London.
The hotel is spotlessly clean, is very quite and is second to none.  The staff are lovely and nothing is too much trouble, even offering to lend us an umbrella after we lost ours.

The rooms are beautiful and provide everything you need. We even had the bed turned down and water put on the bedside table each evening which was a lovely touch. The bathroom was beautiful with a lovely large bath as well as a shower. 

Would we stay again? In a heartbeat 💕, can't wait to return. Their Rockwell bar is amazing, once again wonderful staff and the cocktails are to die for.",5,2021,08,09
145,Lovely Hotel In Central Location,"We stayed at this hotel as a family 4 for 6 nights while in London. The hotel sits right on Trafalgar Square and is in an ideal location for walking to the tourist attractions.

The staff are very friendly and helpful, greeting you on every occasion. 

The hotel was very tidy and our room was cleaned on a daily basis. We stayed in a family queen room which was perfect for our family and the complimentary mini bar was great and was filled everyday with juice and water. 

Breakfast buffet had plenty of choices and could not fault this.

We would stay at this hotel again when we return to London",5,2021,08,06
145,Perfect in every way,"Lets start with the location, perfect, it was in the heart of everything, but not at all noisy, you can easily get to everywhere you wanted and the underground was just a 2 minute walk through Trafalgar Square. 

The hotel: Perfect again, well appointed - we stayed in the St James King rooms - had a partial view of the Square and the other couple a view of the London Eye. Great sized beds and a lovely additional seated area. The mini fridge with water and coke was a great touch, and the coffee machine made starting the day just perfect.  Could not fault the cleanliness either.  The small touches, like the added shower supplies and the turn-down service, where water and glass were positioned for the night, just added to the overall experience.

We drank and ate in the Rockwell the first night, as you'd expect they are London prices, but the attention of staff to go over and above and interact, making your experience more pleasant made it even better.  We tried the Rooftop the first night but couldn't get in, however the next night we were lucky -  Although we didn't enjoy it, too noisy, the seats were rather low for a high table and we couldn't wait to leave in all honesty. Though it could have been made more pleasant if the music was turned down a little and the other guests weren't so loud (our personal opinion)

Breakfast: a huge selection was included in our stay, continental, coffee/tea and hot options, you could pay extra if you wanted a special breakfast, such as eggs Benedict, but you didn't really need to to be honest, we managed to find plenty to eat and again the staff were very attentive and remembered personal choices from the previous day.

We would highly recommend this hotel, for location, service and cleanliness.  The front of house staff could not do enough for you and were always checking everything was ok. Would not hesitate to stay again.",5,2021,08,02
145,Mini moon,"What can is say?! This place made us feel welcome and at home from the minute we arrived. Our wedding plans were haulted last minute due to the extension of lockdown so we decided on a last minute midweek break to London... and we couldn’t have picked a better place to stay! Staff all friendly and helpful, the rooftop bar fitted is in with little notice, and the breakfast in the hotel was the BEST we have ever had in a hotel. 
The place has Class without being stuffy. A very relaxed atmosphere indeed. Central to so many places, we spent much of our days walking and exploring without the need for the tube during a super hot heatwave. 
The admiralty pub just across the way was handy for a drink or snack if you didn’t want room service. 
We absolutely cannot wait to return to the Trafalgar. 
Thank you team!",5,2021,07,30
145,"Location, staff, rooftop bar- exceptional","We stayed for two nights last weekend for my wifes birthday after staying at the same hotel 15 years ago - wow what a renovation and difference. This is a Hilton hotel, but under the new high end Curio Brand, we decided not to use points as its  top category and the hotel deals in London at the moment are amazing with no tourists currently coming.
The location is second to none in London,the rooms and bathrooms are very high end, the roof top bar is very special. What made our stay though was the quality of the staff, and a special mention for Antonia at the front desk who went way beyond our expectations and Cem the Hotel Manager who arranged so much for us. How great as well to have a buffet breakfast again after 2 years and it was top quality. I would highly recommend this hotel to couples, families, special occasions or tourists visiting London, you will love it. Thank you again.",5,2021,07,28
145,Family Celebration,"Really friendly staff and wonderful Rooftop Bar & Restaurant.  They do great cocktails and specialise in small plates of delicious food along with about 6 mains, which were very good too.  Couldn’t fault the hotel at all..  Lovely rooms and a great location.  We will definitely be back to The Trafalgar St James",5,2021,07,27
145,"Great, clean hotel","We really enjoyed our stay here and felt safe throughout. The room was very clean and there were disinfectant wipes in the room when we checked in, which was great. The self check-in was great with the room key being on my phone. The only thing I would say is for the price breakfast should be included as standard and it needed to be made clearer whether the water/coke in the mini fridge was chargeable. We will start again if we need to be overnight in central London again. ",4,2021,07,27
145,Very nice,"The Rockwell was very nice. Kyle was very accommodating to where we wanted to sit even though we didn’t have a booking. Our waiter was Paolo, he was brilliant. Very attentive and even bought us a free shot :) 100% returning. We also to the rooftop, which was fantastic. Prawn tempura was amazing!",5,2021,07,24
145,My stay,"A beautiful stay, location is the best I can think of, the room and service were great. The Family Room was generous in space and felt like I am not in the usual London tiny hotel rooms. The staff were so helpful and charming. ",5,2021,07,20
145,Fantastic Break!,Family weekend break in London and we couldn’t have chosen a better hotel.  The hotel location is fantastic.  The team made you feel so comfortable and welcoming that no matter your request it was dealt with in minutes.  Thank you all….we will be back,5,2021,07,19
145,great location and great customer service = great experience,"I would just like to say that our experience during our stay was great. The staff are all highly attentive and a credit to the business.

I want to particularly call out our waitress at breakfast who was named Nona. She remembered that I liked to have a glass of milk with my breakfast and brought me one without being asked. This is wonderful customer service.

We had such a good experience that we are back again tomorrow  ! :)

PS the rooftop bar is great with wonderful views over Trafalgar Square. We booked a table there on a couple of evenings and I think as hotel guests we were able to secure one in a great spot",5,2021,07,19
145,Luxury Family Break,"We have just returned from a much needed family staycation at the luxurious Trafalgar St James, part of the Hilton Brand, Curio. This was our stay under the Curio name and are certain will not be our last.
Room: We originally booked a St James Family Room which was an ample 35m2 and consisted of a double and pull out sofa bed. Prior to arriving I reached out to the hotel requesting a larger room ideally with two doubles, I received a prompt response offering us the opportunity to upgrade to a Nelson Double at a discounted rate due to being HH members. 
On arrival we were greeted by the front desk and allocated a room on the 4th floor (405) with street view of Trafalgar square. We received a lovely welcome in the form of a personalised message from Lucian the manager and some treats and colours for our little one. 
The room itself was the largest room we have ever had in London, a spacious 37m2 and joyous at that. Wardrobes and vanity area encompassed the entrance area with a luxurious bathroom (separate bath and rain shower) to the left. Two double beds, a small seating area and TV and plenty of drawer space took up the main bedroom area. In addition to the complimentary minibar, nespresso machine, safe and wardrobe filled with plush bathrobes and slippers. We were immediately impressed and satisfied with the standard enabling us to settle in and explore London accordingly.
The Location of the hotel was more than excellent, situated directly opposite Trafalgar Square and the National Portrait Gallery, less than a 5 minute walk to both charing cross and embankment underground, a 5  minute walk to Haymarket, Leicester Square and Regent Street - any shopaholics delight and less than 10 to Buckingham Palace. The hotel also backs onto the beautifully vast St James Park which we managed to have a little time to explore on our last day. 
We had originally booked a 3 night stay however were enjoying the hotel and a slightly quieter London that much we decided to extend our stay by an additional night. Valentina on the front desk went over and above to accommodate this even shuffling guests so we could remain in the same room. Thank you!
On the subject of staff, we could not end this review without mentioning the wonderful staff in the Rockwell bar, where we frequented on a number of occasions for afternoon/ pre evening drinks. Gemini and Eleonora were a credit to the hotel! They provided incredible service and showered our daughter with plenty of attention, created replica mock-tails and even had one of the team create flower shaped candy floss. Thank you both for making experience so memorable! 
We would also like to thank the wonderful housekeeping who were prompt at adhering to any requests be additional water or slippers for the little one. 
It is safe to say our first London bound city break as a family of 3  was a success and for that we would like to thank you Trafalgar St James.",5,2021,07,18
145,Beautiful hotel.  Fantastic location stay here.,"Beautiful hotel, our room was ready earlier than 3pm which was brilliant for us.   The room was so clean and spacious we loved it!  The bed was so comfy, complimentary mini fridge with water and coke and loved the way they put a bottle of water on your bedside cabinet each evening for the nighttime.  Breakfast was lovely a good choice and service good I like the way they present it like an afternoon tea and then a choice of cooked breakfasts as well.  The staff were really nice and professional nothing was too much trouble they are a credit to The Hilton Trafalgar Square.  Looking forward to going back for 2 nights in August.  One more thing the air con was a godsend on one of the hottest days of the year after having walked around London for 7 miles.",5,2021,07,17
145,Absolutely phenomenal hotel!!! A must stay!!!,"This hotel is absolutely amazing. The staff and service is second to none. They cannot do enough to make your staff enjoyable. We came here for my mums 50th birthday and they smashed it out the park making this a memorable experience. As soon we walked into the room it was decorated lovely and from there on they just made it a weekend to remember. A special shout-out to Max and Nonna who were the breakfast managers. They were brilliant. The location of this hotel is overlooking Trafalgar Square and couldn’t be more central to everything. Great hotel, great location!!",5,2021,07,14
145,Superb!,"We arrived early in the hope we could drop our bags for the day, to be told our room was already available for us.  We were able to make ourselves comfortable before heading out for the day.  Superbly clean, very comfortable bed, light and airy and spacious.  We couldn't get over how quiet it was considering the location of the hotel. The staff couldn't have been more helpful, polite and friendly.  A great location to enjoy all that London has to offer. ",5,2021,07,12
145,Recent stay,"We attended this hotel for a long weekend break. On arrival the staff were so helpful and we were allowed to check into our room early. The on duty manager Lucian provided great information on the hotel and the places we should try to visit like the rooftop bar.

The hotel is lovely and the room we stayed in had great decor. Lots of space and the bed was so comfy.

The hotel has a great location, walking distance to buckingham palace, covent garden, big ben and oxford street.

Would stay again and would say book this hotel
And you will
Love it

Matthew",5,2021,07,10
145,Rooftop Bar treat,"Rooftop Bar. Fantastic service, great food and good cocktails. 
£50 per head minimum spend for your 90 mins. No problem! Well worth it as a treat.
Views of London spectacular. Staff all efficient and friendly, making time to chat. 
Tempura prawns incredible.",5,2021,07,09
145,Wow - Superb Hotel,"I’ve travelled a lot around the world for business and pleasure over many years, and this is easily one of the best hotels I’ve ever stayed in, with exceptional service, delicious food and beverages, and an incredible location. Everything from the greeting when we arrived, to the check-in, to the food and beverage service was outstanding. The views from the Roof Top bar are stunning. The breakfast was superb. I can’t imagine many better hotel locations in London, literally overlooking Trafalgar Square, and most of London’s other iconic landmarks a short walk away. I couldn’t recommend this hotel highly enough, for business or pleasure. ",5,2021,07,04
145,First rate hotel!,"Enjoyed my very restful 2 night stay at this magnificent hotel. I travel quite a bit and stay at various hotels and found the Trafalgar a top rating place to sleep, relax and eat. Room and facilities were excellent. Staff top notch. Food was great. Highly recommended and in a great convenient yet quiet location.",5,2021,07,03
145,Back after lock-down,We've been staying at The Trafalgar for many years. The service and facilities never disappoint and the experience just gets better. We always feel like valued guests from the moment we arrive to when we depart. ,5,2021,06,30
145,Perfect hotel!,"Just returned from a 2 night stay at this stunning hotel. 
We stay in London at least 3 times a year however this is the first time at the Trafalgar St James.  We have nothing but positive words to describe our stay!

The team are so friendly and welcoming and cannot do enough for you. We travelled with our 11 year old and never felt uncomfortable as they made a point of always talking to him and making a fuss. 
Knowing it was a birthday weekend we returned to our room to find the most delicious birthday cake which was a lovely surprise. 

The rooftop bar is amazing and the perfect way to spend the evening after a full day of sightseeing. Again our son was made very welcome and says his Mocktail was the best he’s ever had!

For me, the best part was the breakfast. It is without doubt the best breakfast I have ever had in any hotel! 

It is on a small road connecting Trafalgar Square to The Mall so the location is perfect also. 

We’re already planning a return visit it really was that special!",5,2021,06,28
145,Outstanding stay with exceptional service,"This was our first stay at this hotel but it most certainly won't be our last.
From arrival to check out the service was exceptional from concierge, reception and room service.
We stayed in a family king room and the raised lounge area gave a separate area to enjoy the views of Trafalgar Square and the room service.
Unfortunately, I didn't get the name of the gentleman who delivered our room service but he was amazing with his friendly humour and attention to detail.
I would strongly recommend the breakfast as it provides great value for money and sets you up for a good day.",5,2021,06,27
145,2 night mid-week stay for 2 adults and toddler,"2 night mid-week stay for 2 adults and toddler. We booked Nelson suite (connecting rooms).
Pros: 
Rooms - Quiet, air con, very comfortable and clean.
Toddler friendly - Proper wooden cot and sheet provided. Highchair available at breakfast. Interconnecting rooms definitely worth doing. We managed to use a WiFi baby monitor (using a phone hotspot) so we could eat in the restaurant in the evening.  
Breakfast - good food, reasonable range, what you would expect for a hotel of this standard now buffets are not encouraged. 
Staff - very friendly and helpful.
Location - amazing for majority of tourist attractions in central London. Easy to walk most places or get bus/tube.
Restaurant - Rooftop bar. Lovely view, outdoor and indoor area, food fairly limited range but interesting menu. Staff very helpful, particularly DJ who was very attentive and on the ball. 

Cons: 
Right on Trafalgar Square so could be noisy if large event on. 
Windows unable to be opened because of this I imagine but would be nice to at least let some fresh air in sometimes. Air con working fine but not quite the same.",5,2021,06,25
145,Great time - will be back!,"Amazing location, on Trafalgar Square
Not cheap but good value considering the location
We had a large and very comfortable room 
But what really made it a brilliant stay were the friendly and professional staff.
We were lucky and had exceptional weather - which made an evening on the roof terrace all the more enjoyable.
If you go - have the breakfast - not cheap, but sets you up for the day",5,2021,06,17
145,Prime location with lovely staff,"We had a short break in London and stayed a couple of nights. The rooms were spacious and well appointed- in fact the beds are notably comfortable. The bathroom is particularly well equipped, with a separate bath and shower, a lit cosmetics mirror and nice complimentary toiletries.

There is some street noise, so if you're a light sleeper, you may wish to request a room on a high floor.

The air conditioning wasn't working in our room on the first night, but was remedied by the second (although the fan setting still wasn't operable).

Our son was celebrating his 21st birthday, and they hand delivered a gorgeous little chocolate cake, which was thoughtful (and delicious).

The staff are friendly and super helpful and go out of their way to ensure your stay runs smoothly.

There is a bank of rental bikes very nearby, so if you fancy cycling around central London, it's convenient and cheap.

The rooftop terrace has extraordinary views of London generally, and obviously over Trafalgar Square. It's interesting to get a different perspective of Nelson's monument. The staff and the cocktails were lovely, but the crowd were a bit uncouth.

Breakfast is an a la carte menu in the lovely Rockwell.

There were lots of covid-safe precautions in place. 

We were really impressed when reception got in touch the day after checking out to advise that we had left a few items behind. We have never experienced a hotel taking the initiative to get in touch and offer to send items out.",5,2021,06,16
145,The rooftop,"Phenomenal services by Dilhan! Very positive and great atmosphere ! The food was the best, congratulations to the kitchen and the fast preparing! Definitely I’m coming back and I will recommend the place!",5,2021,06,14
145,Fabulous 2 Night Stay in the Heart of London,"Just had a fabulous stay at Trafalgar St James. Very conveniently located and within walking distance of all the sights . The hotel is very stylish and contemporary and the room we were given was very clean and spacious with a view of Nelsons Column and Trafalgar Square. We found complimentary soft drinks in the fridge which were very welcome and a tray of sweet treats which were a nice touch along with the Molton  Brown toiletries. 
Breakfast in the morning was served in the Rockwell Restaurant with its stunning decor. Really good breakfast concept with the continental part served on tiered plates like afternoon tea and a full choice of hot a la carte. It was the best breakfast I have had in a London Hotel and the service was very efficient and friendly. We are looking forward to visiting again when the Rockwell restaurant and bar reopens fully during the day and evening which I understand is planned very soon.
As we were residents we were lucky to get a table in the Roof Top Terrace for drinks, great food and cocktails with amazing views over Trafalgar Square. 
Throughout our wonderful stay at the hotel we received excellent service with all the staff being very professional, polite and friendly, helping to make our stay very relaxing and enjoyable.",5,2021,06,07
145,Excellent hotel in great location,"Excellent location overlooking Trafalgar Square and provides easy access to many tourist locations. Room, food (breakfast and in rooftop bar), and staff service were all excellent and can’t fault the hotel at all. Everyone was very welcoming and keen to make the stay as enjoyable as possible.",5,2021,06,06
145,Mauri the bartender,"MAURI the bartender @ the rooftop bar is the best bartender in all of London. Thank you for looking after myself and my boyfriend. A lovely venue for a date night, beautiful sunset views and amazing food and drinks.",5,2021,06,05
145,Poor management,"I am leaving this review as the hotel have not addressed the issues we raised during our stay and at check out as promised.
Check in room wasn’t ready at 3.20pm so they gave us room 511 which has the smallest window ever had in a hotel. The shower door also turns in so difficult to get out.
We had booked the rooftop bar at checkin for 7pm. Upon arrival they new nothing about the booking and made us feel like an inconvenience.
Breakfast first morning was a disaster. 30 minute wait to be seated then 1hr 30 minutes for simple order as people have mentioned previously service is not organised and the quality of produce and cooking is poor. Appreciate COVID times but this has been ongoing for a while according to previous reviews.
I sent an e-mail to the hotel just after lunchtime to highlight the issues. No reply to the following morning offer of Hilton points and an apology and told  reception would discuss with me and told it would improve etc. Day 2 and breakfast was the same issues. Service is very poor and this took nearly 2hrs again. When we left the breakfast area the queuing was back to the lift.
We checked out at midday and I made it clear I would pay the bill in full if we were addressed about the issues encountered on the second morning. Was told my comments would be passed on to Angelo Cilli who sent the first e-mail to me but would take 24 hrs for some reason. 
Two days latter not addressed despite reminder to him.
On balance due to the issues we won’t revisit. This is due to management not addressing the issues despite raising while in the hotel and the fact they actually don’t seem to care. As I said these are COVID times but there are better options than this.
We spend many weekends in London and despite being Hilton gold have other hotel  memberships so will move to those. This hotel trades on location with roof top bar but doesn’t get the hotel basics correct.",1,2021,06,02
145,Great stay. Breakfast could be quicker.,"Rooms not ready until 3pm and ours was particularly small and and odd shape (327). No heated towel rail, not that much of an issue apart from towels only changes and rooms cleaned on request -  and no coffee pods when we arrived (housekeeper must have forgot).
Great location, friendly staff - busy bank holiday weekend. 

Biggest let down is breakfast. After being told we didn’t have breakfast included on numerous occasions and having to provide evidence we did. Everything takes so long. Despite telling them we had plans. Everyday was the same. Lack of coordination, missing / wrong orders, rushed food, other things they had run out of and had to be substituted. We had to rearrange our plans on 2 days just because of how slow the service is despite arriving extra early. 

We were planning to stay at this hotel again in August because it’s modern, the location is great and we like to rooftop bar, but now have to reconsider based on our breakfast experience alone.",3,2021,06,01
145,DISGUSTED,"Staying for 3 days, room lovely can’t fault it. Breakfast is a catastrophe, never before have I witnessed such bad service. Sat here as I write this, waiting for over an hour and still no breakfast, 3rd day on the trot. It comes to something when all you hear constantly is sorry for this sorry for that. NEVER AGAIN WILL I STAY HERE.",1,2021,06,01
145,Awful restaurant service.,"It was actually a 3* stay overall - the hotel staff were helpful and responsive. 

However the breakfast was possibly the worst service I’ve ever seen. We waited an hour before our breakfast main actually arrived - and in that hour it was a fiasco. 

Wrong drinks order, second wrong drinks order. Breakfast tower but no cutlery followed by cutlery but no plates. We knew before it had even happened that our breakfast order was going to be wrong. 

Excuses that it’s busy - it’s a bank holiday weekend at a fully booked hotel, of course it’s going to be busy. 

Some simple tips... get your waiting staff to actually write things down. The amount of complaints coming from other tables of missed orders, or not even having their order taken in the first place was astounding. It’s arrogant and all for show to try to remember every order and it results in disastrous service. 

Our breakfast took over an hour and a half altogether which ruined our plans for the day. 

Such a shame, but something really needs to be done.",1,2021,05,30
145,Great rooftop bar!,"Lovely rooftop drinks with nice views, the food was also excellent and staff were friendly, there’s lots of heaters with it being terrible weather and we can’t wait to return. It’s not the cheapest of places but no dearer than anywhere else in London",4,2021,05,27
145,Wonderful hotel,"We had such a a warm welcome arriving at the Trafalgar St James, our first trip out in over a year. Nick & staff on front desk put us at our ease immediately. Our spotlessly clean room overlooked Trafalgar Square, a bonus which we enjoyed enormously. The Rooftop Terrace must have the most amazing views anywhere in London, thank you Hannah & Ismail for looking after us so well. Not forgetting Anna in breakfast & Aytug on nights the staff are wonderful. Thank you all for making our stay so memorable. Looking forward to seeing you again soon.",5,2021,05,25
145,Best hotel and staff in London,"The hotel is in the perfect spot in London - right on Trafalgar Square, and is exceptional value for money. Immaculately clean, rooms are brilliantly equipped, and the bathrooms are to a high standard. I always say that the staff makes the expense, and bot does this count in this instance. Josie and Angelo were so warm and friendly when we checked out  (I think his name was Angelo - he had an Italian name and he was on front desk Saturday morning 22nd May). Josie checked us in and checked us out, and she was kind, caring, humorous and patient. 
The services were exceptional, and any problems were solved immediately.
We had room service breakfast and my goodness - Eggs Benedict to die for!

They also had a great checkout time of 12 midday which was wonderful as we had a very relaxing morning in our room as well. 

Room facilities were of Avery high standard - everything we needed. Also, I noticed that the doors did not slam loudly which is really unusual with fire safety doors. Good job Trafalgar. 

It was my daughters birthday, and they left a beautifully wrapped dessert in the room for her on arrival. Such a special thing to do. 

This is my second stay at The Trafalgar and I will always stay here when I up to London in the future.",5,2021,05,23
145,Five star staff and seven star Reza at breakfast,"We arrived with a polite welcome ready to take our bags the room was ready so we went up to room 305 the room was superb with fabulous views over Trafalgar Square with all the mod cons a fridge full of complimentary soft drinks , Milton brown toiletries and fresh towels slippers and robes the bathroom was good but has a little mould behind the sink and a broken seal on the shower also the drain hole in the fridge a little dirty but the linens were superb standard carpets and curtains first class even though there was a few issues we didn’t need to say anything as they were so good at service I said at the desk could you get someone to open the windows for fresh air because of my asthma a really lovely gentleman arrived a pleasure to meet. 
 Well the breakfast is amazing and we had a gentleman called Reza I think 7 star impeccable service a real treat and asset to the hotel he treated us like queens for the stay please pass on our thanks for making our stay fabulous. We definitely would return as the service was amazing thankyou",5,2021,05,20
145,"Excellent stay, definitely recommend!","Had a lovely stay at trafalgar st James, I informed the staff it was my partners 21st birthday and they gave us a free room upgrade! So kind. The room was gorgeous and super clean, very modern. Breakfast was amazing, we paid to have it included. All the staff we met were lovely, made us feel so comfortable and we’re very attentive. The hotel is also in a great location, you can walk to Covent Garden, Buckingham palace and many other spots in 15 mins. 100% recommend and hope to return in the future. Thank you for making our few days in London so enjoyable!",5,2020,12,13
145,Shopping weekend ,"We have used this hotel for many years now. Service, staff are always amazing. We had the Barry suite this time - very spacious and relaxing with its amazing large bed. The location has to be one of the best in London as it’s so accessible to most areas being central. I am not a big tube fan and during COVID we just walked. My daughter and partner joined us in a room 118 which didn’t have the best view but was equally comfortable. Brilliant hotel and amazing staff.  See you all again soon ",5,2020,12,08
145,The Best,"My wife & I booked the suite for Friday and and from the moment we walked in we’re were treated like kings!! 
This hotel is perfectly located with the bonus of The Admiralty pub right next door.
The suite was stunning and the breakfast was one of the best I have had in a hotel anywhere. 
The view from our room was the best!
The rooftop bar is worth a visit however with government restrictions we would of had to order food but we had already eaten so had to leave without having a drink. 
The staff were all fantastic and a credit to the hotel. We have stayed in dozens of hotels in London over the years always looking for something different and dare I say better and with this one we found it.
My wife & I do not think we will bother to try any other hotels after finding this beauty. 

",5,2020,12,06
145,We loved it!,"We stayed at this hotel two years ago (December, 2018) and did not write a review at the time, but we feel this hotel deserves one.  The rooms are comfortable, quiet, clean, and trendy.  The hotel is in an excellent location and the staff aims to please by going above and beyond to help with any need a guest may have.",5,2020,11,29
145,Fabulous Service,Big thank you to all the staff at the Hotel who made our stay so nice and our anniversary weekend very memorable. The room was very clean and the rooftop bar was a great night out. The breakfast was fantastic and best of all all the staff were very attentive and polite.,5,2020,10,10
145,Anniversary escape,"This was the perfect Post lockdown Escape. I booked the Trafalgar hotel, part of the Curio collection under the Hilton umbrella using my points as a Hilton member and from the moment we arrived the personal touch was evident. Bags were collected, the welcome was warm and the hotel was fantastic. Although we were there at 1130 in the morning our room was prepared and little extra touches for our anniversary were all ready. The meal on the roof was great (even though it rained non stop) and breakfast in the same place was elegant and delicious. When I’ve saved enough points we will be back!",5,2020,10,04
145,One of the best hotels in london,"I travel regularly and its always a nice surprise when things are right all the way through your stay.

I believe it was Lexi who checked me in,  she is a real asset to the hotel.  All the staff are, always polite, very helpful and professional.

The room immaculately clean, it was was a standard room but very nicely decorated.  

Roof top bar and restaurant is incredible.  Views across the city and overlooking Trafalgar Square.  

Right next to tube stations.

Walking distance to everything including SoHo and Covent Garden.  Perfect location if you’re site seeing.

I will be back as it was a real treat to stay there.",5,2020,09,27
145,Weekend break,"Stayed at this hotel over the weekend 11th Sept and frankly had a wonderful time great room fantastic staff who couldn’t do enough for us under these trying times. We went to the rooftop bar on the first night and it wasn’t the greatest experience however on the second night and our second visit to the bar we could not ask for better service everybody within the bar staff area made us feel welcome, some great views and wonderful bar staff if you’re planning a visit to London give this hotel a try and pay a visit to the roof bar.",5,2020,09,26
145,Would have stayed longer ,"I had a very enjoyable stay at the Trafalgar St James. I arrived early for check in but that was not an issue as my room was ready. 

I decided to meet a friend for a drink on the roof terrace which is probably best to book in advance as it is extremely popular when the sun is out. 
Constantine was our waiter who was very friendly and made the whole experience that much more enjoyable.

If you want a place to stay which is central, has helpful and friendly staff, great for drinks and comfortable beds then highly recommend. 
",4,2020,09,14
145,Weekend Break,"What can I say. Perfect location in London, fantastic hotel and very professional and helpful team that make your stay special.
All the major attractions are very accessible from this location and most are within walking distance. 
The hotel is well maintained, very clean and modern and has everything you need.
The rooftop restaurant and bar was wonderful for breakfast with its great views looking out over Trafalgar. 
I wouldn’t hesitate in returning, worth every penny and would have loved to have stayed longer.",5,2020,09,13
145,Classy and Elegant St James property,"We truly loved our stay at the Trafalgar St James during these crazy times. They made us feel very welcome as soon as we walked though the doors. The steward that helped with our loads of luggage was so very thoughtful as we explained my daughter had to sadly cut her study abroad short and return home. The staff took care of our every whim. The room was very clean and extremely comfortable. The food, room service and daily breakfast was delicious.The location was the perfect launching point for our daily miles of strolling and seeing the sights.  The view from the Rooftop sky bar was gorgeous!! We only wish we could have stayed much longer. We will absolutely return in the future. Thanks to the entire staff at the hotel, Everyone was friendly, understanding and delightful.",5,2020,03,21
145,Thoroughly Impressed!!,"My family and I greatly enjoyed staying at this hotel. The location is extremely convenient to many of the tourist sights, and catching a taxi or Uber was a breeze. Customer service was beyond incredible, they really bent over backwards to handle any needs or requirements. Unlimited usage of minibar including bottled water. And the included breakfasts were a delight, with so many options presented in the buffet. They even offered a favorite dish of mine, shokshouka, which is a tomato and egg middle eastern dish. If I had to nitpick, I would recommend that a desk be included in the room, as the small table provided was not adequate. Moreover, the 6 foot long bathtub (no shower head) in my opinion is a waste of valuable real estate in the bathroom. The stand inside shower stall was too small for me to fit in adequately, it was not comfortable. But overall  I loved this hotel, and would definitely stay again on a subsequent visit.",5,2020,03,19
145,Classy & Comfortable,"A beautifully refurbished property with great access, elegant rooms, sumptuous dining and a wonderful rooftop experience. The Diamond member room upgrade was pleasant and  the complimentary breakfast at Rockwell sumptuous. Easy access to many London locations - felt very welcome as well received by the friendly staff.",5,2020,03,19
145,Trafalgar St. James hotel,"We enjoyed our 6 night stay at the Trafalgar St. James in London. It was clean, quiet, I felt safe and it was very conveniently located within walking distance of several London attractions (Buckingham Palace, Westminster Abbey, Houses of Parliament, 10 Downing St., Scotland Yard, London Eye, National Portrait Gallery, National Art Galleries, Thames River, Big Ben and more). It is also just across the street from the Tube (London subway-which was surprisingly easy, fast and clean). Just outside of the hotel were several bus stops. The staff were very professional and very friendly. The concierge contacted us (we did not have to initiate the contact) the day prior to our check out to see if we needed any accommodations to get back to the airport (which we did and they helped us with). There was a FREE stock of chocolate, soft drinks and  water in our refrigerator which was refilled daily. Upon arrival, our room had robes, slippers, a hairdryer,a safe, a refrigerator, a coffee pod machine (with delicious espressos and cappuccinos), a tea kettle with several types of tea. There were several plugs and several USB ports for charging our accessories. We had plenty of closet and drawer space. We ate at the rooftop restaurant-the hostess was very helpful- they were busy that night but she still managed to get us an outside table with spectacular views of the London skyline, and the food and service was great. There was a spacious shower but no bath. Our room did not have a great view (but we didn’t spend much time sitting in the room looking out of the window). I would definitely stay here again.",5,2020,03,18
145,Phenomenal hotel!,"Our stay was incredible. The best were some of the most comfortable I'd ever slept in, the staff was helpful and pleasant, and the hotel bar was unique and had great cocktails. We can't wait to stay again!",5,2020,03,16
145,"PERFECT Stay - Excellent Hotel, Location, Service!","This is THE perfect hotel to stay in while visiting London. The location, accommodations, staff and vibe are 5 star all the way. The GM, Mr. Ciampi, is incredibly helpful and genuinely supportive of a perfect stay. I had been in personal contact with the GM and others prior to my trip and from the moment we arrived, we were treated like gold. The rooms are very clean, up to date and ""cool"" with noticeable attention to detail. US size beds (Queen US and King US) - very large. The Molton Brown products make the rooms smell awesome. Totally failed to take pictures of the bathroon but it was great - standing shower + full bath tub, sink and toilet area good size. Terry robes and slippers. They left welcome snacks for my daughter the first day, fresh macaroons for us on the next day, and a birthday dessert the following day - all with cards. (see pics). Literally felt like VIPs each day. They were always smiling at the reception and accommodated our every need. The rooftop bar was cool (we had a drink and app), and the Rockwall restaurant downstairs was very eclectic and a must-see. We had the Trafalgar suite (courtesy upgrade) with a Kind bed (US size) and a sofa bed for my daughter. Very good beds. All drinks and snacks in the mini-fridge are complimentary and you can ask for what you'd like. Nespresso coffee and cream. This room had a make-up vanity and chair (yes!). Location cannot be beat. 10 minute walk to all the local must-sees in London (National Gallery (right out front) Westminster, Buckingham, Covent Garden, Piccadilly, etc). Our room had views of Trafalgar Square. This is the only hotel in London we will ever stay at in the future. Well done, Hilton.",5,2020,03,16
145,Birthday treat,"Amazing hotel, clean warm classy, staff exemplary. We were upgraded as it was my birthday . Perfect location, we walked to covent garden  ,China town fortune theatre and back. View from rooftop bar was second to none . Loved love loved it. Wouldn't stay anywhere else now ,we've been spoilt . Helen and Emalia xxx",5,2020,03,12
145,Great location but ....,"This was a birthday treat for my wife and I let the hotel know beforehand. I'm also a HiltonHonors Gold mamber but neither the birthday nor my status was acknowledged in any way.

The bedroom was OK and large by London standards but was incredibly hot and dry. We both work very early in the mornig with bad headaches and very dry mouths ( no alcohol the previous evening so it wasn't that ! )

I had to leave at 7:30 to go to a meeting but the restaurant didn't open until 7:30 so I couldn't get breakfast there either. My wife had breakfast later and told me that I hadn't missed anything - rubbery poached eggs. I thought that was covered in week one of chef training !!

Great location, nice staff but let down by the room and food",2,2020,03,12
145,Luxury ,"The hotel is very centrally located. On arrival at my room (which had been upgraded) I was genuinely impressed at the quality of the room, large bathroom and amenities. The Molton Brown toiletries were fantastic and the macaroons as an arrival treat were great. 

I did find the room quite noisy and didn’t sleep brilliantly; reception team were very transactional in the way the delivered service. 

The restaurant for breakfast and dinner was good. ",4,2020,03,12
145,Rockwell Bar rocks,"We've just had the most lovely visit for our 10th anniversary. I chose this bar for it's beautiful design and unusual cocktails. It was perfect, and our perfe t waiter Ismail arranged a surprise, anniversary macaron dessert. So thoughtful, thank you Ismail. Xxx",5,2020,03,11
145,Wonderful hotel!,Lovely room - very clean and updated.  I am very picky about hotels and this one was perfect.  Bed was very comfy.  Location can't be beat!  The staff was friendly.  I would definitely recommend this property!!,5,2020,03,10
145,What a fantastic place,My family stayed last March at The Trafalgar St. James and we are heading back next week. The amount of communication and planning that the hotel does on our behalf to make the week amazing is just first class. I have been working with concierge Tom and he has planned a fantastic week for us. He has also assured us of business as usual with relation to Coronavirus. We can't wait to go back to the best hotel in London.,5,2020,03,09
145,Good hotel in Trafalgar - Incredible location,"We visited London in late February for 6 days; the trip went SO well largely in part to the fantastic hotel The Trafalgar St. James.  The rooms and amenities are very, very nice - especially the rooftop bar with stunning views.  The best feature of this hotel is the location; you can walk everywhere pithing minutes:  Leicester Square, Buckingham Palace, Covent Garden, Soho, etc.  Also only 15 minute walk to Waterloo Station - Fantastic.  The staff was super attentive as well and the breakfast extremely good !",5,2020,03,08
145,Wonderful stay at a wonderful location ,"A perfect stay at a perfect place. Great staff from the minute of check-in throughout the whole stay.
Very clean and spacious yet cozy room with all the comfort you need including free minibar.
Restaurant staff is very welcoming and helpful.
Definitely recommend!
",5,2020,03,08
145,Amazing Stay in the Heart of London,"We stayed at The Trafalgar St. James for our Babymoon and loved every minute of it. The filling breakfasts and central location helped us start each day prepared to take on a new adventure. The quiet and comfort of the room helped us relax at night. All staff were helpful and courteous (especially with the middle of the night extra pillows, thank you!). I would definitely recommend the hotel and will definitely stay in again when I return to London. ",5,2020,03,05
145,A truly perfect experience!,"My then-fiancee and I stayed here while eloping and could not have been more thrilled with the experience! The staff was truly excellent and incredibly genuine and the hotel itself is beautiful. The Rockwell has fantastic drinks and quite a good breakfast, and the bar staff was knowledgeable and friendly. Everyone went out of their way to make this a memorable experience!",5,2020,03,04
145,Perfect stay.  Perfect location.,"This remains one of our fav hotel in London.  The location is just perfect.  Charing Cross station underground is less than two mins walk.  There are bus stops just round the corner and you can walk to almost anywhere around Soho, Piccadilly or Regents Street.

We got there before check in time and our room was available.  Bless!  Our room was really decent sized for a city center hotel.  Got everything we need.  Temp of the room was just right.

We spent time at the roof top bar despite the cold and at Rockwell (newly furnished).  

This hotel remains one of our fav and we will be back!",5,2020,03,01
145,Birthday celebrations,"Amazing hotel. Staff are very friendly and helpful. Complimentary cake and birthday card which was a really thoughtful touch. The room was stunning and really comfortable. Will return and ensure a longer stay in the beautiful rooms! 
Highly recommend.",5,2020,02,29
145,Better than Conrad London I think,"I went to this hotel instead of Conrad which I went there 4 years ago. However, I choose Curio this time and I didn't disappointed. Everything was clean and neat. Unfortunately I couldn't had chance to visit the rooftop but I want to go there someday. ",4,2020,02,26
145,Lovely Hotel,I would like to commend Angelo (I believe that's his name) who helped me on arrival with a work related issue I needed scanned and emailed urgently.  I also would like to commend the evening porter unfortunately I didn't get his name but he was great helping us to know our way to getting to a Westend show.  ,5,2020,02,26
145,"Location, location, location!","When choosing a hotel for our 1st trip to this wonderful city, I was basing it on our itinerary.  This was supposed to the last leg of our Euro tour so I was looking for Heathrow area or one that is close to the Tube.  Since we reversed our itinerary, I chose this wonderful hotel due to its proximity to the places we wanted to visit.  We only had 1 full day and 1/3 of the day coz we wanted to go to the country side too.  This place is a stone's throw away from Buckingham.  We bragged to our friends and family that we are neighbors with the Queen.  We easily walked to River Thames, Westminster, 10 Downing St, St. James' Park, etc.  Also for being part of the Curio collection, we knew this place was going to be historic, marvelous and offer impeccable service.  I planned everything for our trip and this was a surprise for my husband.  He just knew that we centrally located in London but he didn't know the extent of it's luxury.  Needless to say, he was very impressed with my choice.  In fact even our tour guide was impressed.  He asked us who recommended this place to us (travel agency or friend/family).  His own words were: ""For being a 1st time visitor to the city, you couldn't have picked a more perfect hotel than this. It's just lovely."" 
 The hotel has 2 bars/restaurants.  The Rooftop bar is a must visit since you'll get an unobstructed view of London's skyline.  Reservations are a must since it is popular.  The Rockwell is a very high end bar at the ground floor with tasteful tropical themed decorations.  Locals frequent the place so you know it is good.  If you decide to be a bit adventurous, you can walk outside and explore the many restaurants nearby (including Sherlock Holmes).  Reservations are highly advised as a lot of locals like to dine out and drink especially around 6 p.m. on wards.  Also if you are not a big breakfast eater and would like to skip the hotel's fare, there are 2 coffee shops nearby (like 20 feet away from the lobby).  This hotel was renovated in 2017 and the room has a modern touch to it without losing it's character.    The other thing we loved is the hotel staff's warmth, friendliness, attention to detail, engagement in conversations without being phony or overstepping their boundaries.  Being tourists we asked Concierge for places to eat (best fish and chips and beer!).  Also as we were headed out to the country side, Concierge helped us pass along our reservations for The Rooftop for dinner when we get back.  It's the little things that make a big difference.  We had such a lovely stay with our limited 3 night/2.5 days in the city that we decided to go back and stay here again on our next venture into this city.",5,2020,02,24
145,Love everything about this place,"A lovely hotel - perfect location. Warm, friendly and helpful staff.
The breakfast - Omg - Amaazing! 
Nice room with very comfortable bed.

The only thing maybe a bit so so is the gym that isn’t really that good at all. 
But overall superb place",5,2020,02,24
145,Cracking cocktails and pre-theatre food at Rockwell bar,"Went here for pre-theatre meal and cocktails on my husband's birthday. It was a lovely room, with attentive staff; a complimentary glass of champagne for the birthday boy was a nice surprise, and the cocktails were imaginative and nicely judged. The food was absolutely excellent (not always a given for many pre-theatre menus). Vibrant flavours in the meaty and generous terrine; gloriously fresh tuna tartare; delightful lamb chops and mediterranean veg; and scrumptious creme brulee.  A real find and good value for this quality of food in such a 'tourist trap' area. Will definitely be back!",5,2020,02,21
145,Highly recommended,Excellent Experience and Location.  Staff were first class and the standard of the rooms also very high.  The location could not be any better - Would easily stay here again.  Easy to travel to from both airports and underground.  The roof top bar has breathtaking views and a real must.,5,2020,02,21
145,Great hotel,I came for a long weekend with my two boys. Hotel was very accommodating. It is in the best location with easy access to all the sites. Hotel is quaint with boutique feel. Breakfast was good and dining room was on rooftop. Would highly recommend. ,5,2020,02,19
145,Excellent location,"Booked a two night stay, very impressed with efficiency and location. Room was very spacious (had a family room) with a wonderful view of Trafalgar Square. Very central for everything we wanted to do and surprised that we didn’t notice the traffic at all. I would definitely recommend having the breakfast ; was excellent value for money, it was on special offer at £11 for two nights for three people that takes some beating! Thank you also to the housekeeping staff who regularly get forgotten. I left housekeeping a note of gratitude (not sure if plaudits are rewarded or not). Would definitely consider again if going to see a show. Perfect location for many of the shows (we saw 9-5).",4,2020,02,19
145,I expected better service - terrible service from the concierge desk.,"I have gone to the Trafalgar St James and on this occasion, the concierge staff often come across rude and unhelpful, not bothered to assist anyone. I visited the hotel this week, only to find that the rooftop was closed (I hadn’t made a booking ahead of time so I was understanding) however, the concierge made me feel so unwelcome, as if to say that I was not welcome - not that all guests were not allowed up at this time. Service brings a hotel to life and the concierge should know that it is the way that you explain things that can make all of the difference.",1,2020,02,19
145,Perfect.,"Cool interiors, friendly staff, super-helpful concierge, perfect location. I’m picky with hotels - this one filled all my criteria and more. 
Will definitely book this again when traveling to London.

The family room was a good size with no problems accomodating a family of four. I loved the design of the hotel, everything from the rooms, fitness-room, reception area with the Rockwell bar being the real gem. The hotel was just the right size to  give a relaxed feel but still very proffessional and helpful staff with the standards of larger 5-star hotels. The doorman was especially friendly, and the concierge fixed us up with tickets to a premier league match - everything was taken care of before our arrival. 
The location was very good in central London, with Charing Cross subwaystation just across the street, and many of the historical London landmarks and shopping areas within walking distance. I highly recommend this hotel! 
",5,2020,02,18
145,Lovely Hotel in a Superb Central Location,"The hotel has clearly been recently renovated and upgraded and the result is a great choice for a London visit. The location is central, yet the room was very quiet and peaceful. The staff was friendly and efficient and everything was exceptionally clean and well maintained.",5,2020,02,18
145,ROOF TOP BAR - SMALL BUT VERY NICELY REFURBED ROOMS.,"Stayed here for a special occasion. Great rooms bit on the small side. Roof top bar for a snack and cocktail light lunch - or great summer spot in the evening.. Breakfast is ordered from a menu for the English and prepared fresh, with toast and other bits on the central table.. A propper toaster rather than the usual conveyer belt.. But beware I like my toast crispy and had a bit of a accident and ended up burning them, the low lit, high ceiling, curtained wall, intimate breakfast room is not one to fill with the smell of burnt toast...!! What a plonker..",5,2020,02,18
145,"Great location, room and superb rooftop views","We booked the hotel because of its great location and we were very pleasantly surprised to find it also had excellent service and a really comfortable room. We especially liked the bathroom and push button shower.
We rooftop bar gave a stunning view over Trafalgar Square, the drinks weren’t cheap of course, but it was a nice ambiance even in early February. We plan to stay there again on our next visit to that part of the city.",5,2020,02,14
145,Wonderful place to stay!,"My wife and I spent our 10th wedding anniversary in London and decided to use our Hilton points at The Trafalgar St. James in London. We had a wonderful stay. Our front desk rep Vandress was able to upgrade our room (per request via Hilton.com). Upon check in later
That day - we were greeted with a wonderful greeting card and anniversary dessert by the manager Angelo (see pics!). The staff is excellent from top to bottom. Very helpful in all aspects of our stay. We were minutes away via walking to all the landmarks and attractions London has to offer and also close to many restaurants. There is also bus stops near by so if you choose to pass up walking or using a taxi - this is another great option. Just a splendid time - we will be back to visit and we will book again with The Trafalgar St. James!!",5,2020,02,12
145,Great location and professional and friendly staff. Place to stay when you are in London,I stayed two nights at The Trafalgar St. James. I really had good time. Staff was very friendly and professional. They upgraded my room without even asking. I am diamond level rewards member. location is great. In the heart of London. Very close to Piccadilly and Westminster. Also charring cross underground station is next to the hotel. I really recommend this hotel if you planning to stay in London,5,2020,02,12
145,Great hotel!,"We loved the location and the hotel was great.  There was some nice touches such as complimentary water, chocolate and coffee (Nespresso) in the room that put it over the top.  I would definitely stay here again in the future.",5,2020,02,11
145,Amazing Rooftop Bar!,"Although our stay at the hotel was fantastic, the roof top bar here is unreal with amazing views of Trafalgar Square. The food was fantastic; we had the vegan platter with pickled vegetables, and beef sliders. Nice drink selection too, of course a little pricey but you are paying for the view. Make reservations as they are quite busy.",5,2020,02,10
145,Thank you,Hotel is in good location and walking distance everywhere. room and other facilites are perfect. Staffs are smiley and kind always helpfull very much. I am totally pleease to stay over this hotel during my business trip,5,2020,02,09
145,Wonderful Stay!,Incredible location. Friendly staff. Excellent breakfast. I am a critic and this place impressed me. We absolutely loved the place. We took the train from Heathrow and returned to Gatwick via subway and train. No need for taxis in London.,5,2020,02,09
145,Birthday treat?,"Hotel superb, bar staff inattentive and breakfast like something out of Fawlty Towers! Very poor service and when complained receptionist didn't even bother to write complaint down so clearly not interested in following up.  Shame as spoilt an otherwise lovely hotel.  Would recommend staying but suggest eat and drink out.",2,2020,02,08
145,Loved our short stay,"Wonderful check in experience - sadly our room was not what my husband (a Hilton Diamond member) had on his file. We always have rooms away from lifts and this one was just next to the double doors next to the lifts. I wondered if we might have heard the lifts machinery during the night. The room also had a communicating door with the room next door, and we have had bad experiences of noise leakage. So we went straight back down to reception and explained our problem. As it was still early, a suitable room was not ready for us so we left our luggage. When we came back many hours later, someone else checked us in and again, the level of professionalism was high. We had been upgraded and ended up in a room with a small seating area (and nice touch, a birthday cake for my husband whose birthday it was). Everything was spotless and we did not need anything more than what was provided. Large bathroom with a great double ended tub, good sized shower (only one sink), great magnifying mirror (useful for older ladies who want to do their make up neatly without their glasses on!), good hairdryer, plenty of shampoo, conditioner, body lotion, body wash, cottonwood pads etc. Dressing gowns and slippers. Water (still and sparkling, coke/diet coke and one water of fancy apple juice and a couple of  small dark chocolate bars). The bed was super comfy. The double glazing was very good (we could not really hear the traffic). Soundproofing was good - no noise from the corridor or the other rooms. 

Breakfast was very good. Loved the decor of the room. Plenty of choice - to be hyper critical I thought that the bread options were not good (sliced white or brown bread, sliced sourdough - I think it was sourdough but could not find a label, and undercooked baguette - like the part baked ones at home but someone needed to cook them longer). Otherwise just perfect for everyone. Service was attentive. 

We returned later in the day for a pot of tea and again, the service was impeccable. Professional and efficient. I would go back to this hotel in a heartbeat (great location on Trafalgar Square).",5,2020,02,03
145,Location,"Pros: Location is perfect, guest relations and hotel Stafford kind and helpful, rooms are clean and Ride as expected and finalle worth for its price either for singles or for families 
Cons: Rooms might have been larger",5,2020,01,28
145,A gem and sooo central,"First and foremost a big pat on the back for the staff. Without fail they were friendly, helpful and involved (in the nicest way). We were on a Telegraph special deal and I have to say it was really good value, having said that surely this is what all hotels should offer but most don’t. The public areas and our room were very comfortable although-note to housekeeping, the lovely grey tiles in our super shower had stained grouting all over them, most unsightly and dirty. Another thing, even though we were clearly staying and had entry cards we couldn’t access the rooftop bar unless we went down to reception (from the 5th floor) and go up in a special lift. I think that’s how it worked but a real faff. The rooftop area is superb and we loved the views. If the deals keep coming we’ll be back.",4,2020,01,27
145,Best location - Great classic and modern hotel,"With walking distance to all of central London, this hotel has the best location. The interior was modern, classic and stylish. The morning buffet on ‘The Rooftop’ was a great combination of everything you need, with the option to order everything you desire. The staff was great. One thing to point out: The hotel was so sound isolated that we didn’t hear a hiss from busy Trafalgar Square.",5,2020,01,26
145,Fabulous Location and Wonder Service,"We stayed here for two nights for my birthday.  The staff were lovely - they made my birthday special.  We had a room overlooking Trafalgar Square, and sat watching London life through the window.  The location was great - and the car park behind the hotel was convenient (if a little expensive - but it is central London!!!)  I'd definitely go back for a special occasion.  Thanks to all staff at the hotel.",5,2020,01,26
145,superbly located boutiquish hotel,"A fresh and modern hotel in an exceptional location. Nice rooms and the best shower I have experienced in a mid priced hotel.

The gym is a little basic. Staff were very friendly but I somehow got ignored at breakfast and had to approach staff to eventually get a hot drink which only arrived after my breakfast was finished.

A couple of minor issues were quicky resolved (no heating and blocked sink).

Having a clean modern room at this price point and location is great.",5,2020,01,25
145,Most highly recommended ! ...,"From reception right through to departure, a wonderful experience in a first class hotel.
Location, staff, accommodation, restaurant ... all exceeded our expectations ... no hesitation in recommending !",5,2020,01,23
145,Great Location,"We only visited the bar on the ground floor. comfortable, nice ambiance, specious, clean, nice back-ground music. Nice decor. Good selection of wines. Ordered a bottle of Chardonnay. Only pity there are many plastic plants..... A nice relaxing place to go before or after a long walk in London.",4,2020,01,22
145,Fantastic ,"The Trafalgar St James is without doubt the best hotel in London that I have stayed in. From the outset, the visit was truly superb. The doorman was always friendly, welcoming and attentive, and never failed to offer assistance. The reception staff were extremely helpful and welcoming. The hotel was beautifully decorated, with lots of fresh flowers throughout. The bedroom was spacious, clean and very comfortable. It was simply the best sleep I’ve ever had in London. This hotel is extraordinary value for money. The rooftop bar and restaurant was a beautiful location for breakfast, with views over Trafalgar Square to one side, and Westminster and the London Eye to the other. The location of the hotel could not be beaten: on the doorstop is Trafalgar Square and Admirality Arch leading to The Mall, Buckingham Palace, Horseguards Parade, Whitehall and Westminster. The stay was luxurious from start to finish; we really felt like royalty. To the very last minute of our stay, the staff could not have done any more. I am already planning my return visits and could not recommend this hotel highly enough. ",5,2020,01,22
145,One of the best hotels in London,"I visit London regularly and stay in different hotels all the time. In particular I've stayed at almost all the major Hilton properties, but I've also stayed at many other great hotels. This hotel is not big, not expensive and not stuffy. It's friendly and convenient.

Entrance
Be sure to tell the Uber driver the address -- 2 Spring Gardens. When you arrive (it's a small side street) you will be greeted by friendly bellhops who will help you inside.

Front Desk
Super friendly and helpful. I was there a week and they helped with everything I needed. Always had smiles.

Location
It's on a small side street about 10 meters from Trafalgar Square. Whether you are visiting for business or as a tourist you can't beat this location. It's convenient to everything. The theater district, many of the best restaurants, several museums, etc are all within a short walk. And the tube is about two blocks away.

Room
Modern and very comfortable. Also small, but not as small as some European hotels. Bathroom was supercomfortable. My room has a small window with a view of main street and the Eye.

HHonors
The told me to raid the mini bar every day for free. I had free full breakfast every day. Also got a free upgrade and free wifi.

Food
The breakfast buffet on the roof could have more options but it was good. You can't beat the views, though, with Trafalgar Square all around you. Lunch was just ok.

There is a Pret A Manger half a block away where you can grab a sandwich for $2 so it's easy to eat affordably.

Arts
Theaters and museums are all around you within short walks. You can also walk to the palaces and Big Ben within 20 minutes each.

Noise
Even on New Years Eve I never heard sounds outside and slept soundly.

Conclusion
This will likely become my go to hotel in London.",5,2020,01,20
145,The best in London!,"Amazing location, short distance to main attractions! The trafalgar suite is very comfortable, free wi-fi, complimentary mini bar with nespresso cofee, luxurious amenities, very quiet! Breakfast delicious!!",5,2020,01,19
145,Memorable stay! ,"We stayed at Christmas for 3 nights and had a wonderful stay. Our room was on the corner of the building and had direct views of Trafalgar Sq. and Nelsons Column. It was wonderful to open the curtains and look out each morning to such a wonderful, ironic view. The room was certainly the highlight, as the hotel does lack slightly in amenities. It has a rooftop bar, but no pool or luxury spa as some 5* hotels have in London. Breakfast was served downstairs in the restaurant and was perfectly adequate but not outstanding. Service was personal and quick. I wouldn’t hesitate to stay again when we’re next in London! ",5,2020,01,19
145,"Great property, great service.","My wife and I stayed there for five nights on reward points. I'm a Diamond member and we were treated as valued guests. We were upgraded to a corner room with an amazing view of Trafalgar Square. The room was great, the staff were wonderful. We both said we would never stay anywhere else in London and are looking forward to returning to this property. I thoroughly recommend it.",5,2020,01,13
145,Exceptional!,"We have been planning mom’s birthday trip for several months communicating in advance!   Between the concierge and Angelo, everything was perfect!   They found a bright room overlooking Trafalgar Square, the front desk and concierge staff was friendly and inviting, the room was spacious, modern, USB ports and mom was surprised with a card, macaroons and birthday balloons!    I always measure a hotel by the bathroom!   The water pressure is great and the towels huge and fluffy.  A full array of toiletries, a full tub and rain shower.   The bathroom and room are larger than most, we had a sofabed and king for 3 people with fluffy feather pillows as requested!  Bathrobes, free mini bar replenished each day and free wifi that was great.   Housekeeping staff never bothered us and kept the room stocked. Breakfast buffet in the morning was awesome on the rooftop bar.   At night, the rooftop bar gives you the best view in the City!  You can see Trafalgar Square and London Eye!   The highlight is the location!   You can walk to the Palace, Covent Garden, Mayfair and Soho with subway stationson every block.   The restaurant Rockwell next door also has awesome drinks and light bites.  I am trying to remember everything but this hotel exceeded all expectations and I would never consider another hotel on a return visit!  We were initially trying to decide between St. Ermins and this hotel (Hilton v. Marriott and we are in Marriott the rest of Europe) and so glad we picked Trafalgar!  There are no negatives and many restaurants and shops in the hood, we even saw a play around the corner!    We are Hilton Gold members, and although an upgrade was not available and there is no executive lounge, we were treated as queens with free breakfast buffet daily!  Oh and the door man couldn’t have been more friendly and helpful!  Just all around happy staff and customer oriented!   You won’t be disappointed!  ",5,2020,01,12
145,Lifetime experience ,"This stay was a reunion of friends as we met after nearly 9 years. Hotel is located just a few steps away from Trafalgar Square. Rooftop restaurant and bar is the highlight of the hotel. The concierge was extremely helpful and so keen to help guests. The reception team was very friendly and had a welcoming attitude. We were welcomed with a platter of macaroons. Room was nice clean and comfortable. Restaurant, as I mentioned, is located on the roof and you need reception lift to get there except breakfast hours (floor lifts can be used). Staff members at the restaurant are very professional, friendly and talkative, especially when the managers get involved as well in small talks. I’m the evening don’t forget to make a reservation for the rooftop.
I really want to appreciate housekeeping here because housekeeping staff didn’t make any noise not even in the corridors. Room was made as fresh. Check out was smooth and easy.
I think it couldn’t be better as it was perfect. A huge clap for the team St. James to deliver a lifetime experience. Thank you.",5,2020,01,12
145,"Great location, modern hotel, some issues to resolve","Stayed for just over a week on holiday at The Trafalgar St James. 

I would give it 3.5/5 (rather than 3), but I have rounded down since you can't give half ratings. This was because of a couple of issues that disappointed me during my stay; otherwise I would rate 4/5. Let me explain why:

Firstly, what I liked about the hotel:

- It is modern and clean, as you would expect from a 5-star Hilton affiliated property, with rooms nicely appointed and comfy bed.

- It is directly across from Trafalgar Square, making it a great central spot to explore London, with easy access to public transport as well being in walking distance to a large number of attractions.

What I thought was a bit average:

- The rooms at the back of the hotel (including the one I was in) look directly into the office building positioned behind the hotel. There is a small courtyard separating. This limited natural light, and I could see people in the office at their desks; who no doubt could see me in my hotel room.

- Although rated 5-stars, the lobby is relatively small and isn't anything particularly large or grand.

- Breakfast buffet served in the rooftop bar was reasonable, with continental options plus typical English breakfast options (scrambled eggs, bacon etc). However, don't expect a spread as large or comprehensive as typical main-line Hilton breakfasts.

There were two issues that I faced at the hotel that left me less than impressed:

- On the last day, the hot water system failed in the morning. It was winter in the UK, so I endured a less than pleasant ice-cold shower. Reception had suggested I wait it out until the boiler was fixed - not something possible when you have a train or flight to get to. While I realise that things occasionally happen; this is the first time this has happened to me in a hotel (or indeed in the residential apartments I live in), and did not leave a good impression on my final day. The only acknowledgement of the issue was when I called to ask what was happening.

- Room service can be ordered via a touch screen table in the room. This is a nice and handy feature that I appreciated - except about 50% of the time the order was ignored, and I had to call room service some time later to get them to actually realise an order was made. I did receive my order free on one occasion because of this, but it occurred multiple times, so it wasn't a one off issue.",3,2020,01,11
145,January sales,"Just spent 3 nights at the St James in Trafalgar sq. the location is first class, The hotel is very comfortably furnished and we really enjoyed the cocktail bar and it’s delights but the icing on the cake is the rooftop champagne bar with its brilliant views of London. This is my new favourite place to stay in London. 
  Thanks to all the staff who made a special hotel even better.",5,2020,01,07
145,TOP MARKS on TRAFALGAR,"From beginning to end our one week stay at the Trafalgar St. James Hotel was near perfection -- aside from it's great location as the only hotel property that is directly on Trafalgar Square -- the property was excellent and made our visit a wonderful experience. The property exhibits a stately appearance from the exterior; however, when you step through the doors it gives way to provide an air of attentiveness yet relaxed comfort thanks primarily to the efforts of the staff in both the public areas and your room.  The Trafalgar St. James is part of Hilton's Curio Collection and certainly performs at the standard that should be expected for this designation.

Upon check-in, we were provided an upgrade (see how below) and accompanied to our room, and a ""tour"" and demonstration of the functions of the room and its amenities such as the TV; safe; in-room computer tablet; etc were provided (Thank you Valentina). The room itself was extremely spacious and provided dual corner window views directly onto Nelsons' Column and across the entirety of Trafalgar Square itself. Postcard perfect... we were even greeted with a plate of colorful macarons and a nice note from the Guest relations manager, Maria, who was very kind and expressed her willingness to assist with any needs. Request room 303 when booking -- you won't be disappointed -- unless of course we beat you to it and are ""in residence"" -- haha

Breakfast was being served during our stay in the Rooftop Lounge, as the primary restaurant was being renovated -- The Rooftop enjoys a naturally sunlit dining and drinking space with great views day and night to the London skyline.  One can expect a fairly standard spread of buffet items that would compose a traditional English breakfast -- as well as an extended offering of fruits; pastries, cheeses; deli meats; breads and juices.  If you wish -- a small a la carte menu of egg dishes and other breakfast standards are also offered, for either an extra charge or inclusive -- depending on what room booking option you elected. The only complaint we can register is that the delicious pumpkin bead with the vanilla frosting disappears too quickly. Service in the breakfast room was always attentive with empty plates being cleared from the table and coffee replenished frequently. Many thanks to Chiara and Redhi, who provided service with a smile and greeting all week.

The hotel has many of the amenities one would expect in a five star hotel -- including an on-site restaurant; fitness center; meeting rooms; an excellently staffed concierge desk and a great doorman, Gary, who was both our greeting introduction to the hotel upon arrival, as well as on our departure and many interactions in between.  He is a fountain of knowledge and ""insider info"" and one hat you should make a point of talking with.  Also -- the hotel is home ton of the nicest bar/lounges we visited in London: Rockwell. A very comfortable and visually appealing respite from a day's activities or in preparation for a night out or night cap.  The drink list is extensive and inventive and they serve small plates and bar food that was very good also.

A central location is something that we strive for when staying in a major city such as London -- and you would be hard-pressed to find a hotel property that provides you with access to as many places to eat; the theater districts; museums and historical sites and landmarks from it's iconic Trafalgar Square doorstep.  The Charing Cross tube station is literally 3 minutes walk from where you can either reach or connect to all of the City's major transportation hubs and numerous interesting sites.. 

As noted previously -- The Trafalgar St James is part of Hilton's Curio Collection, which offers ""boutique-style"" properties throughout the world. The hotel reflects this status and handles guests with discretion and a level of benefits accordingly.  They appeared to strive to assist with whatever your needs may be and one should feel comfortable in seeking personal assistance when required at a hotel of this standard.  I would also recommend that you enroll as a Hilton's Honors member prior to booking at their properties, which is free  -- since they provide great discounts and benefits.  The Trafalgar St. James extended an offer for an upgrade several days prior to our arrival while we were still in Rome, and consequent to our HiltonHonors membership and confirmed it prior to check-in.

We will be staying at the Trafalgar St James on every future visit to London based on our most recent experience.  You should too.",5,2020,01,07
145,Outstanding,"Stay for one night on Saturday in room 519. Huge room for London immaculate with a comfy bed. Not much street noise on the 5th floor. Roof top bar has a great view over London with friendly bar staff. The bar down stairs has a nice atmosphere and again nice friendly staff. Check in and out was quick and simple. The breakfast had lots of choices and was fresh, the only down side was the service was a little slow in getting hot drinks and items running out where slow to be replaced. The staff at breakfast where pleasant but seemed a bit under staffed. The location is great easy walk into the theartre district and surronding area. Will definatly be staying again",5,2020,01,07
145,"Nice Hotel, poor breakfast.","Our second visit. Great location and nice hotel with friendly staff. Two criticisms,
1) Our room on the 6th floor was lightly vibrating until after midnight with music from the Bar above.
2) The breakfast was poor, cold scrambled egg and tough overcooked bacon.",3,2020,01,04
145,This Hotel is a Gem!,"We were pleasantly surprised at our experience at this property.   We booked this property due to location but that was only one of the perks. The service and accomadations were outstanding.  The rooms were spacious and luxurious. 
The Roof Top bar will give you a view that is breathtaking.
You will be in walking distance to many areas.  My only complaint is that we were only there for one night!  Can't wait to visit again. ",5,2020,01,03
145,Excellent,"The price is definitely on the higher end. That said,you get what you deserved. Friendly hotel staff; very clean room with nice mini bar , amazing roof top breakfast area, great location. Would probably stay there again.",5,2020,01,02
145,Would stay here again,"Very central location. Many major attractions within a short distance taxi ride or walk. Since I arrived during the holidays they seemed quite busy. 
My check-in experience was a breeze. Andrea got me into a room well before the standard 3pm check-in time. She was very professional and courteous.
The room itself was plenty big, although I do wish it had a standard chair for me to use. The bed was quite comfortable, but I cannot tell a lie, not as nice as the bed at the Hilton SEA. A minor point.
The bathroom was spacious enough. Just remember that in order to start the shower, there is an on/off button to use.
Environmental controls were a bit of a challenge for me to use too. That is probably the only real knock I can make on my stay.
Cleaning staff were extremely fast and efficient at getting in and cleaning the room up each day.
Overall, if it’s in the budget, a great place to stay.",4,2019,12,30
145,Cool vibe .....and love the roof top bar...,"The Trafalgar hotel ,St James is in a great place for exploring the centre of London being near to theatre land and walking distance to Covent Garden .The Trafalgar enjoys a birds eye view of Nelson’s Column from the roof top Champagne bar: we raised a glass to the man who saved the nation. Try the Admiralty Pub opposite...with old time atmosphere ,good beer ( London Pride ) and a very short walk home.If you are visiting London ,then this location is hard to beat and the hotel accommodation and public space have a surprisingly cool vibe. We will return.",4,2019,12,29
145,Very nice property in the center of everything,"Nice room, very contemporary, ample sized, very clean, and bed is comfortable. As a Diamond member I received an upgraded room which looks like a studio suite with a small living area. The view of the room is right at Trafalgar Square which is very nice.
The location of the hotel cannot be beat. It is close to everything and many major sites with tube and bus station nearby. 
Breakfast is located at the top floor of the hotel which has very nice ambience and food is delicious as well. 
",5,2019,12,27
145,Very comfortable,"We stayed here for two nights.  The hotel is very well located, tastefully decorated and very comfortable.  The location is second to none - walk outside and you’re in the midst of Trafalgar Square.  Our room was spacious and clean.  Breakfast at the rooftop bar was first class with a wide range of food.  Staff throughout the hotel were very friendly and helpful.  Would certainly recommend this hotel.",5,2019,12,27
145,Awesome Hotel in  London Trafalgar Sq!,"This is a great hotel that is central to everything you need in Central London. The service is impeccable and the atmosphere has a nice chilled vibe with a very sophisticated edge. The room was lovely, modern and spacious. And the views of London from our 5th floor widow were fantastic. The breakfast was rather special too in the Rooftop Restaurant. We were in London for two nights and would definitely return to the Trafalgar St James next time we fancy a few days in the city",5,2019,12,22
145,Five stars aren’t enough!,"My second visit to this hotel and it was just as fabulous the second time around! It started with amazing service by Andrea at the front desk , where we were upgraded for more space.  Amazing service and recommendations by the concierge, bar staff and housekeeping to make my family and I feel very special.  Will cancel my hotel reservation in January and come back to the Trafalgar st James!",5,2019,12,22
145,5 Star property,Perfectly located on Trafalgar Square the Hotel does have a five star feel with great service from the start. Nice size bar with an elegant feel to it. Breakfast is served on the roof and is a quality you would expect. The rooms are very clean well appointed with all the amenities to make a pleasant stay.,4,2019,12,18
145,Location and views...,"Fabulous location. Very clean modern hotel and reality quite. Roof top bar is one off the best locations in London. 
Our Bed/mattress was horrible so be sure to check it out before you settle in for the night. Staff is super! ",4,2019,12,15
145,Great location ,"This is one of the best locations in central London. One is surrounded by museums , restaurants, shopping and everything else London has to offer. The staff are mostly non-English speaking which can be challenging at reception and with housekeeping. Breakfast, in a wonderful rooftop location,  was not well managed and the manageress was rude with a false sense of power. One can wait an inordinate amount of time for a coffee which is simply unacceptable. The rooms are comfortable with a proper shower and excellent amenities but my overall impression is not to return. The location dictates a premium price and the hotel doesn’t live up to its surroundings. ",3,2019,12,15
145,Wonderful location but that's about it.,"Well this hotel is definitely not worth its hype... lovely staff and fantastic location but that goes for many less expensive hotels. The greatest disappointment was its roof top terrace where we had one of the worst breakfasts I have had and unbelievable for such a high rated hotel... cold, boring and totally not worth the money. We had a late night drink in the Rockwell bar which was lovely but after having chosen a cocktail for 13 pounds I was unhappy that vat. and service charge was then added.. it may be okay for people who have money to burn but for a couple wanting a lovely break ... don't bother and spend your money on something else.",2,2019,12,13
145,Good service,"We were due to stay in the hotel for a two nights weekend break in London.
Unfortunately my wife got ill and we couldn’t travel.
We contacted the hotel and told them about our scenario.
We found the reservations staff very helpful and considerate to why we had to cancel.
In our booking we had past the cancel expiry dates, but thank you to the hotel that refunded our booking in full.
Thank you to the team at this hotel

Yours sincerely 
Diarmaid Ryan",5,2019,12,13
145,Terrible Experience,"Staff and restaurants leaves much to be desired. Also they intentionally removed my rating on Facebook.
Hotel location and decor is great but the customer service and restaurant experience ruined my trip to London.",1,2019,12,12
145,Good but not outstanding ,"I wanted to stay in a quality hotel which was walkable to Westminster Abbey, Covent Garden and the shops and this place seemed to fit the bill. The location is perfect so was a great hub to venture from. All the staff were helpful and courteous which always goes a long way. The room was well decorated and furnished with some great features, however I was disappointed that there was only a shower as after a busy day I love to have a long soak in a bath so that might be a deal breaker for when I need a London hotel again. One thing I was surprised by was the lack of environmental awareness for the in room drinks supplies - every minutiae individually wrapped including single sugar cubes! The communal areas were immaculate and well maintained, though I missed there being a communal lounge area. Breakfast was standard Hilton fare which is ok but could do with updating with artisan breads etc. Overall though it was a good stay. ",4,2019,12,12
145,Great time in London,"Wonderful weekend spent in London. Great shows and vibe all around the city. Loved the shops, The restaurants and pubs. Nice weather for walking also. The Hotel was a great place to make camp for some relaxation in preparation for the next shopping spree. ",5,2019,12,11
145,The good and the bad,First let me say that the location of this hotel was very good to visit many tourist sites.  That being said we found the website to be a bit misleading.  The standard queen bed room was a lot smaller than we thought it would be.  The bed was not a queen size but was full sized even though I booked a queen room.  It is to small for two people to fit comfortably.  Also we were given a card for 2 free cocktails which would have been nice except when we tried to use it in the rooftop bar they said that we could only use it in the bar off the lobby.  Really?  Also for the amount of money we paid I found it to be incredible that they charged me 7 pounds to make two local phone calls to make a dinner reservation.  That is called nickel and diming people.  I will say that the breakfast buffet was very good however they need to heat the large plates because if you wait more than 3 minutes your scrambled eggs will be cold.  I don't know if I would stay here again for all of the above reasons.  It wasn't a terrible experience but could have been a lot better.,3,2019,12,10
145,A location and level of service that is unequaled.,"We come to this hotel several times a year. The location is unequaled -- walking distance to the theatres, the restaraunts of Soho, the National Gallery and great shopping. The staff are genuinely eager to help with anything. The only let-down is the new restaurant. The menu is a bit limited and the kitchen seems to be very slow. But there are plenty of places very near by. Though the lobby is quite cramped, the rooms are plush, scrupulously clean, and surpisingly quiet given the location. The quality of the beds, towels and amenities are as good as anything you'll find anywhere.",5,2019,12,09
145,GREAT LOCATION,"The location of this hotel is ideal.  It's walking distance to Buckingham Palace, Piccadilly Circus, Trafalgar Square, Westminster Abbey and the theater district.  There are lots of restaurants in the area. The Underground is close by.",4,2019,12,06
145,No hot water,"This hotel has a great location but pettiness and no hot water on waking the morning of checkout spoilt the stay. Problems happen, but this hotel showed lack of sympathy to the consequences on guests. We had no hot water to shower in the morning, a problem for the whole hotel. With such a major issue you would expect a manager to be on hand to manage guests. Instead reception staff were more interested in an unpaid cup of coffee from the “included” breakfast - never heard before breakfast included but the not the coffee.

The rooms are a reasonable size and fitted to a high standard and except these two issues a good stay, but it’s difficult when you are treated badly at check out 
",2,2019,12,05
145,Best Hotel Experience,"The location and staff were incredible. If you're looking for a central hotel that is newish, but not too expensive, this is it! The staff were so friendly from the second we arrived and always offering to help with anything we needed. ",5,2019,12,03
145,Weekend away,We arrived to be kept waiting with people who worked at the hotel looking over the glass from Reception down on the bottom Reception. Nothing was said as we had stayed here before and didn't realise that the Reception was at the top of the stairs.  Given room 210 which was for disabled people. Not a problem at all and no point in moving on the Saturday to another room. Staff in the bar were not over friendly on the Friday night. Only disappointment we had was the view again out the back of the building. Breakfast was ok though a fried egg would cost you extra plus any other coffee except for filter.  Beautiful hotel and the refurb looked fabulous. Will be going elsewhere next time though,4,2019,12,03
145,Great hotel overall,"Lovely historic property that's kept its roots but added the Hilton standards and service quality. This was our second time here and continued to enjoy our stay. Service is consistently great and love the mini fridge amenities refreshed daily, what a great addition! Only caveat would be the pull from Concierge. Understandably this is not a 5-star luxury property, but it would be helpful to have concierge with more pull with restaurants and exclusive entries. When we stayed at the Intercon Park Lane, Concierge made magic happen. Also, our Housekeeper kept refilling/adding more bottles of toiletries, even though we didn't use them. By the end of a 3 night stay we had 11 bottles sitting on our bathroom counter - wasteful!",4,2019,12,01
145,Excellent Hotel All Around,"We stayed 2 nights on the 6th floor, king room on the back side of the hotel, no view. The room and bathroom were modern and clean. We found bed and bedding very comfortable. The hotel seems recently renovated, well appointed. The reception staff were friendly and helpful. We visited in the off-season so the hotel was quiet. Of course, the location is a notable value in this hotel. We loved being close to tourist sites, underground station, and theatre district. We enjoyed our stay and would love to return on our next trip to London.",5,2019,11,30
145,Curio @ St James,"Beautiful, quaint and private hotel with nicely appointed rooms in an excellent location providing central access and ease of travel to most of London’s top sites to see. We will definitely consider staying there again next visit.",5,2019,11,28
145,Almost hidden gem,"This is one of Hilton's ""Curio Collection"" hotels and it is a wonderful place to stay in London. It's on a small side street about a block from Trafalgar Square. From the rooftop restaurant you can look down on Lord Nelson's statue. It's just off the Haymarket and across from where The Strand begins to it's convenient to Mayfair, the theater district as well as to Covent Garden and its environs. Rooms are lovely, service is terrific and it's very quiet",5,2019,11,27
145,Fabulous Dining Experience;,"
We visited the Rockwell on Saturday evening. 
We were stuck on somewhere to eat and had tried booking in to the (OXO Tower, Dorchester and The Shard) leaving it a bit late I must add they all had no availability so we popped into here during the day; The lady who greeted us and arranged our booking was ever so helpful she showed us a menu sample and even suggested the best table for the evening. We were slightly late so we rang ahead and the lady who answered was ever so kind and changed to booking. The steak was cooked to perfection and the cocktails were amazing. We will be back, many thanks. ",5,2019,11,25
145,Great experience,"Spent two fantastic nights at this hotel, and can very much recommend this hotel. 
During check-in you are welcomed by a friendly, professional and efficient staff. The reception area is spacious and has a lovely atmosphere. 
The rooms are very spacious and bright, and offers everything you need to make your stay comfortable. 
During my stay, you where always greeted ""good morning"", ""good evening"" etc by the staff, which helped make you feel welcome at the hotel. 
The location is straight on the Trafalgar Square, within walking distance to St.James park, the castle, Oxford street etc. The closest metro station is just around the corner, and not least, the nearest pub is just across the street, which comes in handy if you are looking for a little drink before settling down for the night. 
However, please be aware that the beds are quite hard. Normally I like my bed hard rather than soft, but the ones they had at my room where on the upper scale compared to what I have experienced other places. With that said, this is just my personal feeling, and it will not affect my overall rating of the hotel. 
To sum-up; HIGHLY RECOMMENDED!",5,2019,11,21
145,Great hotel in central London,"Great hotel in central London! Easy access from the tube 
modern rooms and staff were very helpful and friendly . Great vegan options at breakfast !
Special thanks to the doorman on the 20th November (didn't catch his name ) but couldn't have been more helpful !",5,2019,11,21
145,Expectations Met!,"Great location, staff and price.  Will definitely do again. Staff was extremely courteous and welcoming to all of our requests.  My wife and I celebrated our 27 year anniversary here and all of my requests upon arrival were expertly met.  ",5,2019,11,19
145,Excellent Hotel in Prime London Location,We spent 4 days at the Trafalgar St. James and it was a wonderful experience all around. The staff was friendly and helpful at all hours and the room was very clean and comfortable. They have an excellent selection for breakfast as well. We would highly recommend this location for anyone looking to stay in a centrally located hotel to all key attractions in London. We were able to walk to almost everything we wanted to see. ,5,2019,11,15
145,Don't look any further. This is the place to stay in,"I loved my stay here and will be back. This place is amazing. Location, rooms, service, amenities in the room exceeded my expectations. We stayed in the trafalgar suite. Worth every penny. Food was good. What stood out was the customer service and kind, respectful staff.",5,2019,11,12
145,"Location, location, location!","This is, hands down, the best location for a home base while touring London.  It is adjacent to Whitehall, The Mall and The Strand, leading you to nearly every major historical destination, as well as being adjacent to the Charring Cross Station and a short distance from two other Underground Stations. And despite being in the heart of London, our room was extremely quiet.  We would definitely choose this location next time!",5,2019,11,11
145,Amazing make over !,"Having stayed here many times in the past few years we had drifted away to other hotels because it was a little ""soulless and dated"". Not now! We were amazed at the make-over. The bar is now a welcoming place to sit in at the end of an evening to enjoy a drink or snack and the bedrooms are now more stylish and, thank heavens, soundproofed with extra glazing so you don't hear the traffic from Trafalgar Square any more. The Roof Top restaurant is a fabulous place to eat. The staff, as always, are helpful and friendly and this is an ideal location for visits to the theatre and tourist hotspots. Well done ! We will be back!",5,2019,11,11
145,Superb location,"Oasis of calm in the bustle of London - ideal vase to explore many parts of London including the theatre. Great quality rooms, very clean and comfortable. Roof top bar was an added bonus offering super night time views of the area in a comfortable environment. Did not use the restaurant as late back in the evening. Friendly and helpful staff – highly recommended. Price level reflects the service and quality of the hotel",5,2019,11,09
145,Good hotel in great location!,"This Hilton hotel is nice and clean, with an awesome rooftop bar and restaurant. Rooms are nicely appointed and modern. I like it! The location is hard to beat! Just perfect, in Trafalgar Square! 

However, it is very expensive and also some rooms do not have a proper desk. So if you are here for business , make sure you get the room with a desk! 

Late snacks and a cold beer on the rooftop offer a great view and a nice way to wrap up the day!",4,2019,11,06
145,Exquisite Hotel,"Exquisite hotel in every detail – staff was fantastic; food in restaurant was exceptional; and location was perfect.  Stayed here for five nights and wish my stay could have been extended longer.  Very convenient to tube station, bus stops, and numerous pubs and restaurants.  Will definitely return to this hotel on a future visit.",5,2019,11,05
145,Ten Things You Should Now,"1.	Location. The hotel is literally a dozen steps off Trafalgar Square. The Square, National Gallery and St Martins –In-The-Fields Church are all within 2-3 minutes walk. 

2.	Access. You’re close to the Charing Cross tube station. If coming in from Heathrow a taxi will run you anywhere from 60 pounds upwards so consider taking the tube – you can get there with just one change of train for about 8 pounds instead. 

3.	Access #2.  Some the Square is used as a protest site for various random demonstrations. This can cause a few problems when arriving and departing with luggage. Not much the hotel can do except arrange for a pickup around the back instead.

4.	The Roof Top Bar. The Trafalgar has an amazing rooftap bar and restaurant offering a spectacular view of London. If you’re planning on eating/drinking in the evening let the front desk know as they seem to prioritize non-guests instead of guests.

5.	Service – pretty good. The front desk can be a bit stubborn and rooftop bar staff rather rude. Other than that everyone else was excellent. Room cleaning staff were super.

6.	Breakfast. They serve a full English Breakfast on the top floor, right next to the rooftop bar. You can sit outside with your tea and toast. The breakfast can be pricey – so best to include it in the rate. Marriott Elites get breakfast for free.

7.	Rooms. My room (more on that later) was very spacious, with a large bed, plenty of places to sit and a larger bathroom. The one weird thing was that the bathroom lights were controlled by a switch from the front door.

8.	Room Type. My big complaint. I booked a Trafalgar King – which you’d think would overlook the square, but apparently not. I’m about the highest level of Marriott Elite, so was expecting a way better room that the one I received, which overlooked the nearby pub in a side alley. You can see my view in the photos. The front desk absolutely refused to move me, saying I had the last room in the hotel and that was that. ( I subsequently overheard a gent in bar upstairs boasting about how he’d been given my room and had bullied the front desk into giving him a better one with a view – which turned out to be the room I should have had – so I know they were lying to me.) The manager wouldn’t even speak to me about it. 

9.	General Location. If you are a walker, you can get to many of the main London sights in 15-20 minutes walk or less (recommended vs a taxi) . Green Park up to Buckingham Palace is behind the hotel, as it Admiralty Arch and HorseGuards Parade. Downing Street, Big Ben and The London Eye aren’t too far away either. 

10.	The Pub. There are dozens of places to eat within 300 yards. I would recommend the Admiralty Pub right across the street. Decent beer and nice menu with a nautical theme.

Would I stay here again - yes. However only 4 stars because of the room issue and the snarky bar staff on the roof.",4,2019,11,03
145,The Best,"I have made at least 50 trips to London and the Trafalgar St. James ranks at the top. The staff could not be nicer or more capable. We stayed in the huge, by any country’s standards, Landseer suite for two weeks. It had been the Cunard boardroom, the room where news of the Titanic’s sinking first reached london. The suite is beautifully furnished, spotlessly clean, and has an unsurpassed view of Nelson’s Column in Trafalgar Square. Despite being on the first floor (2nd by North American definition) you hear absolutely no street noise due to triple glazed windows and despite being directly above the bar you hears no music and sense no bass. The room is stocked daily with water, soft drinks and chocolate. There are also two decanters of brandy for your pleasure at no charge. Breakfast is served for four hours in the wonderful rooftop bar. You can order off the menu for an extra charge but there is no need as the buffet has a great selection of hot and cold items including marvelous smoked salmon. If you are coming for theatre (we saw twenty productions) the location can’t be beat. Bravo to a spectacular hotel!",5,2019,11,03
145,Outstanding!,"We have had a lot of disappointing London hotel experiences - tiny rooms, no luggage space etc - so were a little apprehensive, but the Trafalgar St James was a delightful experience. We received a lovely welcome from Mara, who gave us a lovely room, 502, which looked out over Nelson's Column. The room was large, well proportioned, with loads of hanging and drawer space. Bathroom was very well designed.  Bed was huge, with lovely bed linen. All immaculately clean. We had a great family supper in the Rooftop Bar, as well as excellent breakfasts. Staff were, in the main, young but very enthusiastic.
Location is absolutely outstanding. In my view, only The Ritz, The Connaught and Claridges could claim better location.
We will definitely return.",5,2019,11,01
145,A central gem,"I have stayed in this hotel with my 2 year old son and elderly mom for 4 nights. Couldn’t fault anything. The room was spotlessly clean, very spacious and very quite despite facing the main street and Trafalgar square. Loved the design. Seems recently renovated and nothing overwhelming. The bed was very comfortable. More than enough space to unpack, even with the toddler. A very handy Nespresso machine was also present. Breakfast was at the rooftop with nice views and had pretty good options, including gluten free. Staff were amazing from bottom to top. Everybody was so helpful and understanding, especially with my son. You can also see the manager personally taking care of everything, from early hours till the evening. Location wise we were extremely satisfied, almost everywhere within walking distance. Having Charing Cross station at our door step was useful enough in terms of public transport. I must say I have stayed in many upper class hotels in Central London for 20 years, but this one will be my sure bet from now on.",5,2019,10,24
145,Very nice hotel,"I’m so glad that I decided to pay more for a hotel and chose the Trafalgar St. James. The room was clean and very modern. The walk in shower was push to start! I’ve never seen that before lol. Complimentary drinks/snacks are provided in the refrigerator. You can drink/eat them all each day and they’ll be restocked the next. I choose a room/breakfast package that was a great value! It was a full English breakfast buffet with a variety of pastries, charcuterie and the best plain yogurt ever. The rooftop is the cutest and has the most amazing view of the city. I ordered room service one night and must say I had the best fish and chips ever! The streets were blocked off due to a race on the day we were scheduled to leave. The concierge arranged for us a limo and walked us/pulled our luggage to our pickup point. We walked several blocks, so were most appreciative of him handling our bags. I wish I could say I didn’t have a single complaint, but there were a couple gnats in our room. Thankfully we didn’t see them until the last day, but that’s the reason for 4 stars instead of 5.",4,2019,10,22
145,Excellent Service,"We stayed at the Trafalgar St. James a number of years ago. Since then, they removed the open restaurant area on the ground floor and replaced it with a charming enclosed bar area. The restaurant moved to the rooftop, where they serve a nice breakfast.
Overall, the Trafalgar is a class operation, with comfortable, tastefully decorated rooms, with high ceilings.  The bed was very comfortable, and had a feather topper, comforter, and pillows. The bathroom is well-appointed, with generous towels and an excellent shower. Another nice feature of the room was a tablet that functioned both as a way of interacting with a hotel and as a means of using their very good Internet.
The best thing about the hotel is the exceptional service.  Any issue was rapidly and thoroughly addressed. For example, the electrical socket in our bathroom was not working. We called about it in the early evening, when many hotels would tell you to wait until the next day (at best). The Trafalgar sent a repair person up within minutes. He politely and quickly repaired the problem. This sort of service was repeated a number of times and in many different ways. 
As for the location, it is excellent for tourism. You are walking distance to many landmarks and an easy walk to the theaters and restaurants of the West End.",5,2019,10,21
145,Pleasant hotel very centrally located,"We stayed in this hotel for a business meeting and it was very pleasant. The dinner was a bit odd with a lot af Asian shared dishes but the food tasted great. Maybe we would have liked some individual plates as well. 
We did wine tasting and it was also good. 
The rooms were very nicely decorated. 
The location is fantastic just on one side of Trafalgar Square.

145,Beautiful location and Beautiful hotel,"Great room. Loved our view of Trafalgar Sq. Great staff. Rooftop bar is worth going to but the staff is quite terrible (inattentive, unfriendly, stone-faced), especially compared to the amazing hotel staff downstairs. Breakfast is worth buying.",5,2019,10,16
145,Valuable items STOLEN from room - team was apathetic,"I would never take a risk of blaming housekeeping falsely, but this is undoubtedly what happened. Items were stolen from my room. I couldn't get any help or even empathy from the staff. It sounded as if these things happen and they do not even plan to investigate. 

One more thing: be prepared that you might need to walk 5 minutes with heavy luggage through the streets with no help, with no access to taxi around the hotel, on your way to the hotel and while checking out, because of demonstrations around Trafalgar sq.",1,2019,10,16
145,Amazing experience,"A fantastic trendy hotel with a boutique feel. Room is very comfortable, clean, with modern decor, and well equipped. Rooftop bar provides an awesome experience with an amazing view. Entertained a few friends there. Would definitely stay again.",5,2019,10,14
145,Amazing location and hotel,"We spent our last night in London at this hotel after spending a few nights at the Conrad London St James. Trafalgar Square is conveniently located to pretty much anything, a shot walk to covent garden or Lesture square. The hotel is on embassy row [Canadian embassy across the street] etc. It's a great location to enjoy the city. The hotel is marketed as a luxury hotel and for the most park it. There a door man at the door and the front desk staff is nice. I had pre paid for my stay and had the Conrad contact the hotel for an early check in [1 PM], got there and there system was down. The hotel had my credit card on file but they writing everything by paper. Getting to the hotel was crazy because of a protest at Trafalgar Square [45 mins in a car because we had lots of luggage having spend 16 days in Europe]. Having stayed at many luxury hotels, the staff didn't make an attempt to know me [minus points on that]. I had booked the Nelson Deluxe Room with 2 Queen beds. When I digitally checked in I got room 325 but at check in got 321. The room was very cute and trendy. Very spacious [if you were traveling with 4 people it's a prefect room]. The beds are very comfortable and great size. Not many outlets to pug stuff in but they do have USB pods. The mini bar is free [water and coke], the bathroom has a tube and shower. We had tickets to a show so we went to grab a drink at the roof top bar. Service is a mess s [being a upscale hotel] the staff was rude and told us we had 30 min at the bar since we didn't have a reservation. Me and my friend both ordered a drink and downed it because they were not nice. The breakfast at the rooftop restaurant is good lots of selection. The hotel doesn't have a turn down service which for a luxury hotel is a must. Also the staff will give you a look if you pop downstair in some joggers and t shirt. I wanted to go for a run and walked to the front desk to ask a question and got some not so nice looks. I went running in the same outfit at the Conrad and didn't get a not so nice look so it wasn't called for. Overall its’ a great hotel that's located in the heart of the city. Might consider staying here again.",5,2019,10,05
145,Perfect hotel!,"This place was absolutely gorgeous!  We loved the room ( very spacious and well decorated).  The bath was big and beautiful!  The roof top bar/restaurant had the best views of the city .  Conveniently located. Friendly, helpful staff. Would definitely stay here again!",5,2019,10,03
145,Location &  Hotel Not What They Seem,"While the location seems good (close to many sights), the area can be very crowded with snarled traffic.   The crush of people can make walking anywhere difficult.   The location is not worth any premium, and in my opinion is a net negative.   We encountered a Hong Kong protest march, Trafalgar Square was closed for some festival, & mobs were pouring from the tube & busses.   A cab ride of a few blocks in the area takes several minutes.  As to the property itself, it is masquerading as a high class hotel, but doesn’t deliver.   The operators are after short term profit, & this place deserves to fail.   The lobby is tiny because a restaurant replaced most of it.   There are 2 mediocre elevators for 150 rooms, which are shared with the public going to the top floor public bar/restaurant, which also creates security concerns.   Showers have slick floors.   Our first shower had the half wall guaranteeing a flooded floor; the second was so small, you couldn’t do anything but get wet.   Why 2 rooms?   Our first was supposed to have 300 sq. ft. & a queen bed.   It didn’t have either, but it did have loud, pulsating techno rock noise from the Asian disco next door until after 3 a.m.    Management could do nothing, so we were wandering the streets of London between 3-4a.m.   The crowds at that time were smaller but considerably scarier.   We moved to a new room the next day, but already had a relatively sleepless night & had to alter our schedule the next day to move rooms.   The first room given to us was not habitable.    We declined an offer of free breakfasts from the hotel.   To their credit, our booking agent, hotels.com, gave us a voucher, but Hilton & this hotel did nothing, except leave 4 macaroons in our 2nd room.
Apparently, the hotel has been remodeled recently, and there is a plethora of charging locations in the rooms, if that is important to you.   I can’t comment on the food.    The cleaning seemed okay.     The problem is that you are paying for location, and you would be advised to stay in a cheaper, quieter location & get an Oyster card & ride the tube & busses.   Beyond the location, this hotel fails on fundamentals and does not deliver what was promised.
I do not generally write negative reviews, but this property has earned it.  ",2,2019,10,02
145,amazing stay,"amazing stay beautifull location, really friendly stadd. good breakfast and gorgeous restaurant on the top with a beautifull view over the trafalgar square. i recommend it. and i'll come back if i return in london",5,2019,10,01
145,Don’t expect to be made welcome. Do expect to be treated as second class once resident ,"A tacky place, where flunkeys treat you like fodder. 

Shouted at on arrival, ‘you’re at the wrong desk’!

No welcome, no apologies, just silence.

Then more unwelcoming was the sour policing of the ‘Rooftop Bar’. Preference is given to non-guests, residents are sent to the end of the queue.

The hotel’s restaurant was not available the night we arrived either .. imagine staying in a hotel like this..

The best welcome and service we had nearby was across the road at the pub

There are far better hotels in London than this sour place",2,2019,10,01
145,Friendliest Hotel in London,"Never wrote a review before, but created this account just to be able to express how wonderful staying at the St.James is. This is our second stay with our 3 year old daughter. Its located in central London, so wherever we go we are within a 10 min cab drive or 20 min walk back at the hotel for a rest. The hotel staff is incredibly accommodating to all guests but they have a warm heart to particulary the little guests. Bringing warm milk at 0600 oclock, To preparing healthy kids meal with a lot of vegetables, To coming To our rescue within minutes when we had a little accident in the room. I couldnt be more grateful. Its like visiting family☺️",5,2019,10,01
145,Poor quality stay,The room is very loud you can hear people at the bar next door all night long and housekeeping is loud in the hallway all morning. Housekeeping barely cleans the room even leaving dirty dishes behind. Staff are not accommodating at all. ,1,2019,09,27
145,"Great location, beautiful and spacious rooms, and wonderful staff!","The hotel is beautiful, and the location next to Trafalgar Square couldn't be better! The staff at this hotel truly make guests feel welcome and taken care of. We had a wonderful experience and would definitely recommend it to our friends and family. Can't wait to go back! ",5,2019,09,25
145,Everything was great - except...,"We stay at Hiltons around the world, and were excited to visit the Trafalgar St James. There were so many positives, reception, the bell staff, the cleanliness, the location - it was amazing! 

But, the Rockwell, the hotel restaurant, needs so much work, Horrible service, subpar drinks, salmon so over-cooked it tasted like sawdust, and a waitress who wanted to lecture me when I asked for a cocktail straw (which she insisted wasn’t “green.”) 

The hotel was amazing, but the restaurant needs new management, and creative and competent staff.",3,2019,09,24
145,Just the BEST!,"It was my 15th trip to London and one of the few hotels I've stayed in more than once!  You cannot beat the location of this hotel and the rooms are perfect.  They're not huge, but they have every amenity - great bed, lots of USB charging outlets, fantastic bathroom and toiletries, and free minibar with water, soft drinks, and chocolate!  This was the first time we got to experience the Rooftop Bar, both at breakfast (early morning light on Trafalgar Square!) and for drinks at night.  I cannot sing the praises of this hotel high enough.  From the location to the building to the food to the staff -- this hotel is perfection!  I can't wait to return.",5,2019,09,24
145,lovely boutique hotel,"Fabulous location and terrific staff. A very friendly stay, 3mins from the Mall and the National Gallery. The rooftop is a great restaurant with views out over London with the ability to take the roof off if the weather allows. At £27 the full English breakfast is a little optimistic, next time I'll likely go continental.",5,2019,09,24
145,Rockwell's,A fabulous evening at Rockwell.  A really nice bar & the food delicious too.  Great cocktails & lovely atmosphere.  Best of all - really nice people working there.  Ana was wonderful.  Would definitely recommend.,5,2019,09,22

145,Nice Room; Could not get breakfast,First time trying this hotel.  Front staff were responsive and friendly every day.  Tried to get breakfast on my first day and could not get the food I ordered.  Ended up eating at the Garfunkels a couple of buildings away and saving money.  But the crappy restaurant experience affected my stay and my review.,2,2019,09,20
145,Outstanding hotel in the heart of London,"This is the third iteration of this hotel—it used to be not a very nice hotel, then it was too trendy and it is now perfectly done...at least for me.  I spend 60+ nights/year in hotels throughout the world and so think I have a basis to make the comparison.  Outstanding service, well laid out room, love the rooftop for breakfast and drinks.  The staff—from the porter to the front desk to the breakfast service to the maid—all amazingly friendly and helpful.  I will definitely stay here again.  ",5,2019,09,15
145,"Perfect Stay, Perfect Location","My husband and I spent three nights in this lovely hotel. The employees at the front door and the reception desk as well as the concierge were so welcoming and helpful at all times. The king room was large and well-equipped including robes and slippers. The bathroom had both a tub and separate shower. Everything a guest might want has been anticipated except lighting which was dimmer than we prefer. Breakfast was available in the rooftop restaurant with both a buffet and made-to-order items. The location is perfect for museums, Buckingham Palace, theaters and many other attractions.",5,2019,09,14
145,"Terrible reception, nice hotel, great location.","On arrival in this hotel, the check-in desk is not the first desk you come to. The poor person at this desk has to explain to every guest through the door that you can't check in there. 
Confusing and a slightly annoyed and bored staff redirecting yet another new guest. 

At the check in desk, it was too much trouble for the lady on the desk to speak. Or smile, or greet us in anyway. 
It was a difficult moment when I tried to ascertain information on my room booking. 
Very uncomfortable and extremely unwelcoming. 

I left my case with the staff, confident that 5star expensive luxury hotels, in the centre of the city can be trusted to take care of the guests property. Even if they are rude and unhelpful. 

Meeting my sister and friends at the rooftop bar, we spent a wonderful hour in the sunshine,lovely staff, amazing views!

Returning to the stone faced check-in desk, to the less than friendly (I think her name was Antonia but am not positive).
I found my case where I have left it. By the check-in desk, The staff had made no attempt to put it into the care of the concierge. 
I asked why it was still there,  the response was a slight embarrassment but nothing else. 
It was genuinely upsetting. 

It  goes to show that one person can influence the entire atmosphere of a visit. 

The rooms were lovely. The bed very comfy. Generally the staff were great. The location unparalleled if you are going to a show and all the central delights. 
Just beware when you arrive to check in!",2,2019,09,12
145,THE BEST LITTLE BOUTIQUE HILTON IN THE WORLD,"We’ve stayed at many fine Hilton Hotels over the years, but this is now our favorite.  It is an absolutely charming boutique hotel with tastefully decorated rooms, a lovely lobby, a wonderful rooftop lounge with spectacular views and tasty food, and a superb, attentive staff.  Everyone on staff was welcoming and eager to be of service.  However, Iddy, one of the concierges was exceptionally knowledgeable and helpful.  We especially appreciated his assistance, both prior to our arrival and during our stay.",5,2019,09,10
145,Certainly not a 5 Star Hotel,"A/C inadequate for hot days. Our AC broke down and all they could do is to send us a fan. There is practically no lobby. No five star restaurant, paper napkins at breakfast, and plastic flowers. Yes! Plastic flowers! In fact, they have a large bar at ground floor - where they should have had a lobby - full of plastic plants, trees, flowers, you name it. It is the paradise for people that love plastic. Nobody at reception is English. The plastic hotel attracts, of course, plastic costumers with whom one will feel right at home if I only had plastic shower sandals to wear in public. The room was clean and well furnished with refrigerator and safety box. The location is fantastic. They failed to honor my request for a room to Trafalgar.",2,2019,09,06
145,Outstanding Service,"The Trafalgar has served me well many times but last week there was a problem.  It was a warm night and the A/C did not work in my room.  The hotel unlocked the windows to get fresh air but the city had a generator truck running below my window so it was impossible to sleep.  The hotel's night manager arrived at my room with a key to another room (a suite) that had A/C.

The staff at the Trafalgar recognized the problem and fixed it quickly.  That shows real customer service, outstanding service and I will definitely return.  Thank you !

Also, the Trafalgar has an excellent location for walking around the West End.",5,2019,09,04

145,Super place,This is a very individual hotel for being part of the Hilton chain.and that's due to the staff.  We had a couple of very minor issues on this stay but they hotel swiftly sorted.

We moved from The Sofitel and so pleased we did. Love the place and super sleep quality,5,2019,08,31
145,Fabulous Property!,"We stayed at the property August 24-18 for a girls trip. Could not have asked for a better location. The Trafalgar St. James is literally 5 steps from Trafalgar Square and within 20 minute walk of many major sites. We enjoyed the helpful staff. Room was large by European standards and filed with amenities such as bottled water (tap and sparkling), tea kettle, coffee maker. The room had generous storage and a convenient make-up area. Housekeeping was impeccable. We will stay again. ",5,2019,08,29

145,Absolutely wonderful stay,"We had an amazing stay at the Trafalgar St. James for our honeymoon in June.
The hotel is beautiful and intimate. The staff at the hotel was incredibly welcoming, they surprised us with a special treat shortly after our arrival.  The location is amazing as it's walkable to many restaurants and landmarks while also nearby Underground stations.
The breakfast buffet was delicious and fresh.  Would absolutely recommend this hotel!",5,2019,08,21
145,Fantastic hotel in a great location,This hotel is fabulous and you couldn’t ask for a better location. The staff was very nice and accommodating. The room was very comfortable. The only negative was that it did have a loud plumbing sound. When your toilet was flushed or the adjacent room’s toilet was flushed a very loud sound was heard. The location cannot be beat right on Trafalgar Square. We were able to walk to most attractions. We had an evening on the rooftop bar which had fantastic views.,5,2019,08,21

145,"Amazing location, nice property; skip the breakfast buffet","The hotel is super convenient in a central location in the middle of all the main attractions. The hotel is nicely appointed; absolutely loved the bedding and bath accessories.  The room is very spacious especially for Europe.  The front desk staff is courteous and the concierge crew is extremely helpful. 
Two issues that lowered by rating to 4: poor housekeeping and horrible breakfast. The room was never serviced during our first full day at the hotel. They decided to barge into the room at 5:30 PM when we were getting ready for dinner (no identification as 'housekeeping'; just one knock and then opened the door). 
The first morning we decided to try the breakfast buffet. Big mistake. All the hot items were cold or undercooked which was an accomplishment in and of itself given it was the hottest day of the year. The scrambled eggs looked like they were made from those imitation eggs. If they were real eggs, I strongly suggest they get a new recipe.  The a la carte items looked better so we decided to try that the second morning. Curiously, it was the same issue: all the food items that were supposed to be warm were cold. So we stuck to Pret a Manger for the rest of the stay which was conveniently located just down the street. 
I would definitely stay at the hotel again but will skip the food and hope that the housekeeping staff gets extra training.",4,2019,08,10
145,"Excellent service, premier location","This hotel has an excellent service. Its personnel is super helpful and it is super well located. Right in one corner of Trafalgar square.
The concierge helped us with our luggage for 4 blocks to get our taxi driver because the streets were block due to a Marathon. Talking a bout giving the extra mile, this is a great example.",5,2019,08,08
145,Lovely hotel and attentive staff make for a great stay!!,"This hotel gets it right! It was clear to us that guests are their focus, making this the perfect choice when traveling to London. We celebrated our 25th wedding anniversary this year, and this stay in London was part of our anniversary trip. I mentioned when booking that this was a special trip for us, and had completely forgotten by the time we traveled. When we arrived at the hotel, we were promptly greeted, and the front desk staff congratulated us on our anniversary. So nice to be greeted that way after a long night of travel! They delivered champagne and a decadent chocolate dessert to our beautiful suite. Our window overlooked Trafalgar Square and the fountains. For the next few days, this was home base while we toured around London. It's centrally located for all the site-seeing. But with sound-proofed rooms, a quiet retreat too. Rooms are well appointed, and include Nespresso machines with lots of coffee. The fridge is stocked with water and other beverages and snacks, and they brought more water to us every evening. USB ports kept our devices charged without having to use travel adapters. The bathrooms are luxurious, down to every detail. Restaurants, rooftop bar, and room service are all top notch. The staff throughout the property were all attentive, friendly, and very helpful whenever we had questions. Making sure our experience in London was everything we hoped for seemed to be their priority. This level of service makes traveling so much easier. We miss London already. When we go back, we will definitely return to this hotel. Huge thanks go out to everyone who works there.",5,2019,08,07

I was thrilled that the hotel had a fitness center...although i was too tired to use it and working and exploring all week!

She arranged where to meet. What a fab place! Loved it. The company (obviously) the views!! The friendly staff couldn’t accommodate us enough. The shared platters were tasty too.

The guest rooms are large, as is the bathroom which is a welcome change from other hotels with very small bathrooms with no counter space.

Will definitely be back.",4,2019,08,01
145,3 Stars for a 4 Star Hotel,"The location is 5 stars, the Hotel is a 4 star Hilton.  The room was pretty good size for London and clean.  On the other hand, the air conditioning was feeble and the entire hotel hot and stuffy. The bar was excellent but seemed unairconditioned. The breakfast selection was adequate but not 5 star. No lobby and a rudimentary fitness center.  Staff was friendly.  The location is great but there are better alternatives for the money.",3,2019,07,31
145,Disappointing experience that the staff did nothing to correct.  Stay elsewhere.,"If air conditioning matters to you, do not come to this hotel.  If service matters to you, do not come to this hotel.  If having a lobby where you can meet colleagues for a coffee matters to you, do not come to this hotel.  If having a desk in your room matters to you, do not come to this hotel.  If you think being a Diamond Hilton member will get any kind of special treatment, do not come to this hotel.

The tragedy of this hotel is that I liked it much, much better *before* the renovation a few years back and the renaming from humble The Trafalgar (by Hilton) to the haughty The Trafalgar Saint James, Curio Collection [insert more pretentious words if desired].

Amazingly, somehow, despite a major renovation they couldn’t install reliable air conditioning. Read the reviews.  At least during my visit the air conditioning in my room worked – however, it did not work in the lobby (which is now so small that it probably doesn’t matter) or more importantly in the giant Rockwell bar/restaurant that took virtually all of the space that used to be a nice, big comfortable lobby where you could meet people.  Merely appropriating the lobby wouldn’t have been so bad, but cutting it off as they have and then having no functional air conditioning basically makes this hotel lobby-free, restaurant-free, and bar-free.  And aren’t those three things you expect in a supposedly 5-star hotel?  Yes, it was hot in July.  I was there during a heat wave.  But they had a heatwave last year, and they'll have one again next year.  The hotel should be ready for it.

Adding insult to injury, due to some kind of construction, they served breakfast in the rooftop bar instead of downstairs -- this might be fine in November but in July, the glass-enclosed, non-air-conditioned rooftop bar is basically a *greenhouse*.  If you want to eat your eggs and bacon on a 90-degree patio, then this is the place for you.  

Adding insult to injury again, the people who run the place seem clueless.  I told the front desk, live, in-person that I wanted someone to call me because I was unhappy about many things.  No one ever called back.  Only after complaining to Hilton central did I finally get a note from someone.  Moreover, despite cheating their paying guests out of services (e.g., an indoor air-conditioned restaurant) that are advertised as part of the hotel, the folks in charge then rent out the rooftop bar on a Thursday night to a private party.  Perhaps give the paying guests a chance to get drink somewhere cool once the heatwave broke?  No-sir-eee.  Back to the “sauna bar” downstairs.

The front-desk is slow and incompetent.  The hallways are dark.  The rooms are claustrophobic – mine had only one small window – and oddly decorated (no I don’t want Mick Jagger looking at me when I undress).  The basic rooms lack desks, so nowhere to work.  There is no executive lounge so nowhere else to go work when you realize you have no desk.  Despite being a Diamond member, they did not offer me an upgrade to a room that cost less than 10% more than own (and which was clearly available during my entire stay per their website).  

Run, do not walk, away from this hotel.  If you insist on Hiltons, then stay at The Conrad Saint James which is similarly priced but a true first-class hotel.  Or, stay the nearby Sofitel which again is much, much nicer than this place that seems to think you can dupe hipsters by adding some cool decorations while getting rid of the desks, the air conditioning, and the service.",2,2019,07,31
145,Great Location. Decent Hotel.,"Let me start by saying this hotel's location cannot be beat. Directly across from Trafalgar Square, National Gallery, and Charing Cross tube station. For two tourists with 3 days in London, we could not have found a more strategic spot in the city to base ourselves. 

Cashed in Hilton points for 4-night stay with my wife. Unfortunately we were placed in the smallest room (all rooms are small, but I could tell ours was the smallest based on the fire safety floor plan). Room and bathroom were decent--about on par with your average Kimpton or Curio hotel. Bedding and bath products were also reasonably nice. Breakfast was decent, but, again, nothing to write home about. Nothing 5-star about the place, but I would classify it as a solid, smaller 4-star hotel. Most experiences at the hotel were above average, but not exceptional.  

Given the price of the place, we had our hopes set higher, but we are probably just not used to London hotel prices. It was worth the points and the money we saved, but I doubt I would return to this place in the future given the number of options in the area.",4,2019,07,29
145,Staff needs customer service training,"The staff were too involved in being perceived as cool and on a number of occasions engaged with guests in confrontational ways.  In general my wife and I considered them aloof and juvenile.  The only redeeming staff members were the bellman and a waitress at The Rooftop.  The bellman that assisted us upon arrival was very attentive and even offered my wife and I an umbrella one morning when he saw that we were inadequately prepared for a day out in London with a forecast of rain imminent.  The waitress at The Rooftop that impressed us was simply the only person who appeared to care about the patrons in the bar when we visited on our second night.  She ran herself into a state of exhaustion picking up the slack for every other employee, who were either flirting with each other or simply being lazy.  Customer service training and management training could make this hotel a premier destination in London.  Without it, the hotel will continue to be beautiful and well situated, but woefully underwhelming. ",2,2019,07,29
145,Great service for our loud family,"We had a great stay at the Trafalgar St. James. The location cannot be beat (walking distance to so much), the rooms and lobby are well-appointed and clean, and the service was great.  My son had a weird reaction to something in London and had hives all over his body for days, and the hotel went above and beyond to help us keep things allergen-free and make sure we enjoyed our stay.  We also had drinks in the downstairs hotel with nearly 10 kids, and we never caught an attitude from anyone about it. Definitely family friendly but also upscale.  Sadly, I could never really make it up to the roof bar because there was never enough room for us, which I was bummed about, but it was a great trip overall!",5,2019,07,29
145,Weekend break,Just returned from a lovely weekend break.  We were upgraded to a junior suite which was spacious and clean.  Huge comfy bed and Molten Brown Toiletries.  Cocktails were amazing and bar staff were great to watch making them.  Rooftop Bar was lovely with fantastic views.  We will definitely come back.  Thank you.,5,2019,07,28
145,So so,"Great location just across Canada house and British Museum. Rooms really small, no lobby at all. Rooftop bar really tiny with not so great service. Especially not so great for London. Breakfast was good with standard choices. All feeling about interior and space gives claustrophobic sensation. Would not go back.",3,2019,07,28
145,Bad service,"Cooling system was not working for 4 days. Talked to staff multiple times. Got rude answers. Bad experience overall. Giving it 2 starts because I was happy with the location of this hotel. Everything is walkable. 

",2,2019,07,27
145,Still good due to excellent location and I would stay there again,I did not get the room that I had reserved by phone.  I detest staff knocking and immediately walking into room and I always keep the bar across. Staff should never say guests’ room numbers out loud.  Staff never answer the phone. Extremely limited room service menu. I expressed some concerns at the time and the Guest Relations Manager Marta Kerenyi contacted me and listened to my concerns and was very good Thank you,4,2019,07,27
145,Ground floor bar at The Trafalgar St James ,"Ground floor bar at The Trafalgar St James. A little haven a short walk away from Lord Nelson's Column and with excellent service.
The bar is just to the right of the concierge desk and the ac was working. 
Nibbles starts at an over priced 4.00 GBP but we got ours complimentary. 
Sharing flatbreads at 12.00 with salmon, mushroom and organic Welsh lamb. Well worth the try, particularly the lamb. 
Fishy tacos at 11.00 or 12.00
Brioche at 10.00 or 12.00, delicious. My small bottle of beer was 6.50 so clearly pricey but it is a small haven away from the bustle of the 1000s of London Tourists. ",4,2019,07,21
145,4 stars but should be 5.,"Great property.  Brilliant location. Small and personal. Rooms good but need more light over the mirror so you can see to use the hairdryer. AC was not working which was a major issue. Food quality good service failed 3 times. Staff all lovely but something missing in the process. Training, attention to detail, common sense, not sure how to fix it,  but to get 5 stars management need to step up.",4,2019,07,18
145,Great location.,"Love the location but Air Con did not work, very warm in the room.  Paid too much for AC not to work.  Staff very helpful and friendly.  Max at Rooftop Bar very helpful and accommodating.  Tom at Concierge is wonderful and efficient!  
",5,2019,07,17
145,Can’t beat the location. Some rooms have fruit flies.,"Centrally located right across the street from Canada House in Trafalgar Square and within walking distance from all the major attractions in the Westminster area, this hotel is an ideal base for a visit in London if you’re a tourist. The roof top bar has an amazing view of the square and you can enjoy breakfast there in the morning too. The rooms are on the smaller side of things but well designed. 

During my stay however I did notice some fruit fly problem in the bathroom, perhaps they came in through the drains - but not a major problem.",4,2019,07,17
145,Best Customer Service Ever,"I recently stayed at The Trafalgar St. James with my boyfriend for a few days at the end of June. The morning of our checkout I realized I had forgotten an expensive new coat at the restaurant I had eaten at the night before. We had to catch a train at 11 am to Amsterdam and the restaurant would not open until noon. As a last ditch effort, I asked the hotel concierge if there was any advice on what I should do. Without hesitation, he took down my information and the information on the restaurant and said he would try and track it down. No less than a week later he had driven to the restaurant personally and confirmed the brand of my coat and put in storage at the hotel until I gave him an address to ship it to. My coat arrived at my home in the US before I even got back from my trip. This kind of service was beyond anything I could have imagined. 

On top of that remarkable effort on their behalf, the breakfast was beautiful and delicious, the rooftop bar had spectacular views, the newly renovated bar in the lobby was stunning, and the rooms were magnificent. Whenever I am lucky enough to visit London again I will without a doubt be staying at The Trafalgar St. James. I am also going to recommend this hotel to anyone who is going to London in the near future.",5,2019,07,10
145,Short Stop,"Loved it! Perfect Location, perfect London experience, staff couldn’t be more helpful from start to finish. Big shout out to Vandreas on front desk. What a star! Arrived after 26 hours travelling from Sydney and made to feel at home immediately. Highly recommend x",5,2019,07,09
145,Perfect Hotel in a perfect location,"You can't ask for a better location. Central to everything. While a little expensive we found it well worth it. The room was a normal size for four people. We faced the square and couldn't hear a thing. The Rooftop is amazing. Make sure you make a reservation for the evening. Hotel guests get priority and you will need it. If I come back to London this is where I'd stay, hands down.",5,2019,07,08
145,Fantastic location!,"Located in the heart of London at Trafalgar Square is a peaceful sanctuary.  After a long day of international travel it was wonderful to arrive to our hotel room with a very friendly staff offering complimentary  food and beverages in our room’s snack bar.  Very nice touch!!

Walking distance to so many things it’s in his perfect location.  

The restaurant was wonderful and we thoroughly enjoyed our meals there
",5,2019,07,08
145,Pleasant Stay,"Staff were very polite and friendly and the facilities were fantastic, really enjoyed the breakfast at the Rooftop Bar with the stunning views over the city. I would definitely reccomend this hotel and will certainly be back.",5,2019,07,05
145,Beautiful Hotel with Great Location,"The Trafalgar St. James is a lovely hotel with a central location. The entire property is up-to-date and well maintained. Their complimentary Internet service worked well, and the rooftop restaurant gave a great view of London.",5,2019,07,04
145,"Surprised a Friend at a Friendly, Well Situated Wonderful Hotel","We had the opportunity to surprise a friend for her birthday.  We caught the Yankee game, the Tina Musical and P!ink.  All that was easily reached using the Underground, the Charring Cross station, just a very short walk from the hotel.  The rooftop restaurant for breakfast or dinner, the lobby cocktail bar and Ibby, the amazing concierge, with bellmen who feel terrible if they cannot help you.
This is a lovely hotel.  Enjoy!",5,2019,07,03
145,I would definitely stay here again!,"All in all, I had a great experience at this hotel.

Kind staff. Centrally located. Not overpriced. Beautiful building. Rooftop bar. CLEAN 🙏🏼. Free select mini bar. Milton Brown toiletries. Well decorated.",5,2019,07,02
145,This hotel is perfection,"Perfect location within walking distance to shopping, sites and tubes; incredibly helpful staff at front desk and concierge who go above and beyond to provide great service; 
nice, large rooms;  really varied and delicious breakfast.  This hotel has it all and we are incredibly happy we stayed here.",5,2019,07,01
145,Overrated,"This is a very noisy hotel with poor double glazing. The result is disturbed nights- forget about siestas as there are live gigs in Trafalgar Square which make afternoon naps impossible!
The breakfast buffet has very limited choices and the quality is mediocre.
The staff are helpful and attentive.
",3,2019,06,29
145,Fantastic ,"This hotel is worth every penny. The location is absolutely unparalleled, being right off Trafalgar Square. I was concerned that being so close to the action would make for a noisy stay, but the rooms were very peaceful and quiet. The design is very stylish and the room very comfortable. The rooftop bar boasts simply incredible views and the food was good. I stayed in a nearby hotel for a few days before my conference to save a few pounds and regretted it, I wish I had stayed in the Trafalgar St James the hole time. A few extra pounds improved the guest experience tenfold. Would highly recommend and would stay again if returning to London.",5,2019,06,23
145,"Central location- Modern, Clean, ROOFTOP breakfast bar, amazing and hospitable staff!","Highly recommend this place- perfect location- The Mall - Buckingham Palace is just right around the corner, Covent garden is .5 miles about 10-15 mins walk. British museum and parliament about a mile away too! Hop on / off bus stop just right outside. Trafalgar Square is an entertaining place to hang out..buffet/ ala carte  breakfast was delicious. Mini bar replenished everyday.. bed and pillows were very comfortable! 
Only thing I can say is that we were given a room with 3 steps to access and I have a stroller with me so it was difficult at times esp when my baby was sleeping.. maybe staff can take that into consideration when assigning rooms? 
Other than that- our stay has been amazing- will be back for sure !",5,2019,06,23
145,Excellent hotel,"The hotel is in the center of the city. 
We had rooms on the 1st floor. The windows were excellent and blocked all traffic noise outside. Hotel staff also booked us two rooms that were connected with a door. Rooftop, where breakfast was served, was nice. I can recommend this hotel. ",5,2019,06,18
145,Amazing stay in Very good location for sightseeing,"Beautiful hotel in great location near to all the best London attractions. Walking distance to the Buckingham Palace, Trafalgar Square with its museums, nearby Leicester Square and the China Town, West End and within few minutes walking also the London Eye, Sea Life, Shrek Adventure and the London Dungeon.
Very professional and approachable staff at the hotel. 
Room was very comfortable with the best bed you can expect after a long day sightseeing. Posh amenities and really nice room decor.
High level of cleanliness.
Nice breakfast served in the rooftop restaurant with great view of the city skyline.
Tourist busses can be found just outside the hotel too.
Well done to the entire hotel team.",5,2019,06,18
145,Drinks at the Roof Terrace,"Great atmosphere, spectacular views and delicious cocktails. We finished off my 40th birthday celebrations here on Saturday night and it was all just perfect. Great service too! Recommend the Margaritas :-)",5,2019,06,17
145,Drinks in the Rooftop bar,"Perfect place. The views are spectacular all enhanced by the delightful, friendly staff and the lovely vibe. We passed an hour here on a Saturday afternoon. Highly recommend the sharing platter and possibly the best green salad ever. Will defo return.",5,2019,06,16
145,Nice Stay - Thank you Ibby !!,"We had an overall nice stay.  the rooms are very nice, clean and comfortable.  The staff is very service orientated.  A special thank you to Ibby, the concierge who helped get my suit jacket to me after i mistakenly left it in my room upon checkout.  we had a wedding in Oxford the next day and Ibby made sure it was there for me !!

i am a little confused with the pricing as our suite unit did not come with breakfast but our friends had a lower price room which included a full breakfast.  we did take advantage of the continental breakfast through Hilton Honors ",5,2019,06,13
145,Great location!,"Hands down would stay at this hotel again. Right by the Trafalgar Square and a short walk to Chinatown and the Covent Gardens. The room was nice, the concierge was helpful when we had questions - overall a great stay!",5,2019,06,12
145,Best place to stay in London ,"Loved the place and it’s amazing service and friendly staff, it’s home away from home, it’s my second time to stay here, walking distance to everything, museum, theatres, cinemas , restaurants and shops. Loved having breakfast at the rooftop,fantastic views, wonderful breakfast buffet and menus, and when you need nightcap once again just go to the rooftop, minute away from your suites, best place to unwind 😊",5,2019,06,11
145,"Superb rooms, location, staff, and car parking facility.","Highly recommended.  Expensive but definitely worth spending tga t extra.  Couldn't fault them.  Even had a complimentary mini bar.
Location was just right for us and within walking distance of sights we wanted to see.",5,2019,06,10
145,Exceptional service and location!,"Just returned from a 4 night stay and had the most fabulous time. The reservation and front desk teams (Eniko, Martina, Matteo, Jiyoung +) are simply terrific and love their jobs, you can tell. The elegant Trafalgar King room is very spacious and with separated bathtub and shower - it's a shame though that we can't open the windows because we had a partial view of the Trafalgar Square. The hotel is centrally located to everywhere and we did a fair amount of walking, including to the London Eye (15min walk). Bus stops and tube stations are all around. There are a couple of options on-site for bar food and cocktails: The Rooftop (stunning views!) and Rockwell (brand new cocktail bar). All in all, can't wait to go back. Cheers!",5,2019,06,07
145,EXCELLANT STAY AND STAFF,"We enjoyed three nights here post cruise.  Although we are Hilton Diamond members I expect you would get the same treatment regardless of who you are.  The breakfast items are very extensive and for us at the time served in the rooftop bar area.  They have redone their lobby bar/restaurant (small plates) area so maybe they have since moved breakfast there.  The roof top is a wonderful place for an evening cocktail with a nice view of the city.   Amazing what you can actually see from only 6 floors up.  Recommended to make a cocktail reservation as the rooftop bar is a pretty popular for locals too.  We also had drinks in the lobby bar/restaurant as it had just reopened.  Very nice comfortable, nicely decorated venue.  The hotel is very centrally located to underground and Hop on Hop off bus.  Front desk and concierge were always very helpful with information, directions and restaurant recommendations.  They really took good care of us.  Thanks Trafalgar.",5,2019,06,07
145,Central London Gem,"Part of Hilton Curio Collection. Nice rooms, great bed. Perfect central location for a first time visitor to London. Easy walks to Covent Garden, the Thames, Big Ben and Westminster Abbey, Buckingham Palace. Short rides to Knightsbridge and Chelsea.",5,2019,06,04
145,London visit,"I think this was the nicest hotel I ever stayed in. Bed and pillows were comfortable. Staff were friendly and courteous and helpful. Breakfast choices excellent . Location of hotel for shopping , theatre, and metro excellent.",5,2019,06,03
145,Wonderfull hotel in a fantastic location.,"You can't beat the location - directly on Trafalgar Square and within walking distance of the major London attractions.  This Art Deco hotel, completely renovated two years ago, is this epitome of style and class and can compete with the best hotels in London.  The rooms were spacious and well decorated with all the amenities you would expect in a hotel in this class.  About the only difference between the Trafalgar St. James and a Michelin 5 Star hotel is that they didn't turn down the bed and leave a chocolate on the pillow!  The staff was friendly and helpful, the doorman never missed greeting us.  The Roof Garden was closed for renovations while we were there but we did have breakfast in the first floor lounge/bar. Most surprising was the value for the price!  I would expect to pay a lot more for a hotel like this.  I and my 2 friends highly recommend The Trafalgar St. James to anyone traveling to London.",5,2019,06,01
145,Good central location,"Very good hotel. Staff were friendly, polite and helpful, service was good. Rooms were clean, stylish and spacious. Drinks at the rooftop bar are on the pricey side even for central London but worth it for the view on a sunny evening. ",5,2019,06,01
145,Top-notch service in a superb hotel,"Service was excellent from time of arrival to departure.   Concierge made excellent travel accommodations for a day of sightseeing at Windsor Castle.  Baggage was handled efficiently and the staff was fully attentive to our needs.  The room was spotless and well decorated.  Breakfast was superb in the rooftop restaurant.  This was a nice way to get the day started, with a panoramic view of the city.  We will definitely choose this locale again when visiting London.",5,2019,06,01
145,My favourite place to stay in London,"This hotel is all about the location, and location couldn't be better. You are a short walk away from every major landmark in London - Big Ben, Westminster Abbey, Piccadilly, West End..
To be honest, I didn't spend much time at the hotel, but rooms are not too small and they are kept very clean. Breakfast is very good, and all staff is friendly and polite.",5,2019,05,31
145,Amazing hotel,"Booked this Hotel last minute, what a great surprise. The hotel has recently been refurbished, comfy contemporary rooms, stunning bar downstairs and an amazing rooftop bar. The atmosphere is lively but not loud and the cocktails delicious. The staff are courteous, friendly and professional. The location is perfect for theatre and restaurants. 
We will definitely be staying here again, highly recommend this to couples and families with older children .",5,2019,05,27
145,1 night stay,"Nice hotel right in centre of city handy for Covent Garden or Piccadilly etc. Rooftop bar overlooks Trafalgar Square nice atmosphere, clean comfortable rooms nice staff nice breakfast, although our room had no view at all but not a problem for 1 night.",4,2019,05,26
145,Concierge is AMAZING in helping me plan my trip!,"My family is traveling to London in August ( group of 7) and staying at your hotel 8/9-8/13). Ibby has been absolute WONDERFUL in helping me arrange transport, tours, obtaining tickets— just answering questions and giving advice.  

We are so excited to visit your hotel.  It looks beautiful but honestly the customer service I have received from Ibby makes it even better—-amazing concierge service that I was given 3 months before even stepping foot inside the hotel!  

Being out the the country and being we are a group of 7, we truly needed assistance and Ibby clearly went above and beyond.",5,2019,05,22
145,Outstanding hotel in great location,"The Trafalgar is a cutting edge property well located in St. James, near theaters, restaurants, museums, galleries and other tourist sites. Easy to reach from LHR via tube. Welcoming friendly staff, comfortable rooms, excellent breakfast. Definitely will return here on next visit to London.",5,2019,05,22
145,Weekend in London,"This hotel has style. From the minute you arrive the staff pay attention to you and extend a warm welcome. Afterall you never get a second chance to make a first impression.
Its expensive but has the facilities to match.The pictures on it's website actually match up .The  room was quiet and very comfortable
Dined in the roof bar drank in the lounge and just  thoroughly enjoyed the whole experience. Special mention to Javeen in the lounge to him and his staff for looking after us so well. Drinks are pricey but if you want a brilliant location with a view of Trafalgar Square you have to pay.",5,2019,05,20
145,Fantastic Hotel in a Great Location!,"I strongly recommend this hotel after staying here twice in the past two months. I love the location on Trafalgar Square which is centrally located in London and within a few minutes walk of the National Gallery, Leicester Square, Buckingham Palace and several underground stations (2 minute walk to Charing Cross tube). The front desk staff is always very polite and friendly.  In addition, the rooms are very nicely appointed and includes a complimentary mini bar with cold non-alcoholic drinks. My only minor complaint is that the glass enclosed shower is too small and feels a bit claustrophobic, however I wouldn’t hesitate to stay here again!",5,2019,05,19
145,Great location,The staff were fantastic at this hotel and the food was faultless. Breakfast was not my favourite part because I felt it was a bit disjointed up on the roof top but the root top bar in itself is lovely at night! The hotel itself was perfect. Just what you would expect from hilton. ,5,2019,05,18
145,Second stay - currently Trafalga Restaurant being renovated - some inconveniance - nice suite,"This is our second stay at the lovely boutique hotel.  Excellent location overlooking Trafalgar Hotel, attentive staff, efficient service, excellent décor and interiors, good food.  The problems was that the main restaurant on the ground floor was closed for a complete removal and renovation (despite this being a newish hotel), but we did not find out until the night before our arrival!  Breakfast was relocated to the smaller rooftop restaurant and bar area - a shame as we liked the Trafalgar Dining Rooms.  However we had a great room, this time a suite - on the 5th floor The Railton Suite.  Very large, nice décor, well maintained and serviced.  A bit tight on hanging wardrobe space given that this is a premium accommodation.  The sitting room could do with an extra table light on the console and the windows are small in this room.  The blackout curtains were surprisingly ineffective in the bedroom as they did not pull fully across the window.  The soundproofing was excellent as was the air con.  Superb bathroom and cloakroom.  Would have liked to have known about the renovations in advance and would like to try the new Trafalgar Dining Room = next time.",4,2019,05,16
145,Lovely boutique hotel in central London,"Chose this hotel as a Hilton Honors member and was very impressed by the location, value, and staff. Our room was extremely quiet due to the extra glazing installed in this old building. Rooms were not large but large enough for 2 travelers and the king size bed was wonderful. Our package included breakfast served in the rooftop restaurant which was buffet style and a la carte. On the first day there were some hiccups with the buffet food being cold but the following day the staff made a point to let us know they had fixed that problem. The entire staff were super friendly and helpful.....would recommend to anyone that wants to be right in the middle of London but have a quiet place to sleep.",5,2019,05,15
145,AMAZING HOTEL IN AN INCREDIBLE LOCATION WITH GREAT STAFF,"My first regret is having stayed here, as it has now ruined hotels for me forever.  The staff from the moment we walked through the door worked their tails off to make our stay a pleasant one.  The rooms are nice and roomy.  The room was very clean and well appointed.  AND THE SMELL!  Holy cow, every time we walked in we were greeted with the best fragrance due to whatever they clean with and the diffuser they have in the room.  The bed was comfy, and you get a tablet to help make your stay even more user-friendly.  Even though the hotel is right in the heart of a very busy area, we didn't hear a peep in our room due to the double windows keeping the outside noise out (despite only being one floor up from the street).  The bath tub is a long tub where you aren't cramped in with you legs bent - feel free the stretch out and relax with a nice soak after a long day of sightseeing.  Incredible hotel.  It was a bit expensive, but given the location and the amenities it was worth every penny and then some.  If we ever come back to London, the first thing I will do is book a room here!  We were there for an anniversary trip and they treated us like royalty!  I could not ask for a better group of people than the concierge and the group at the reception desk.  Concierge arranged for our trip back to the airport in a super nice car with a great chauffeur.  I am excluding the rooftop bar from this review and will write a separate review for it so as to not detract from the actual hotel amazingness, but in short - go next door for food instead of upstairs.  The Rooftop was not a good experience.  But this has got my vote for BEST HOTEL IN LONDON!",5,2019,05,13
145,Great Location and Great Service!,"We spent 7 nights in this hotel:  April 28 - May 4, 2019 and May 11th, 2019.   The location could not be any better - you are literally in the center of London.   You are in Trafalgar Square and can walk to the National Portrait Gallery,  Buckingham Palace, Westminster Abbey, Piccadilly Circus, and easily hop on the bus or Underground to all of the city!   The rooms are well appointed (free mini-fridge selections), comfortable beds, large windows, lounger with table, and bathroom with soaking tub and separate showers.  We stayed in a Nelson Two Queen Room.    Please don't miss the Rooftop Bar (they save some tables for hotel guests but make a reservation if you want to be assured an outdoor seat).  The view is terrific and so is the wine list!   The main floor bar - Rockwell is fun with talented show bartenders who make fabulous drinks!   The Staff:   Ibby the Concierge is wonderful - he will set up airport transfers, dining reservations, rental cars, tickets to tour sites - anything!   All of the staff we interacted with were accommodating and hard working and happy to help!  Trust me, stay at the Trafalgar St James if it's in your budget - completely worth it!",5,2019,05,13
145,Great hotel great location!,"This hotel was outstanding! The service and attention to detail is as amazing!  
The breakfast was good. Location was exceptional, we were able to walk to numerous sights and restaurants! We were a block away from the bus stop.
We will be back!",5,2019,05,13
145,"Great hotel with some service in the restaurant being uneven - some great, some bad.","A perfect location in London - literally right on Trafalgar Square.  Walk across the Square to visit the National Gallery or St. Martins in the Fields, which has a wonderful cafe in the crypt and fabulous free or inexpensive concerts at lunch and some evenings.",4,2019,05,11
145,"Excellent hotel, staff and service","The hotel and staff made our London experience even more enjoyable. The staff is very accommodating, professional, and friendly. Our room was very nice, comfortable and clean. The room is supplied with robes, hair dryer, complimentary sodas and water. ",5,2019,05,10
145,A Series of Issues,"We stayed here for four nights in May 2019.   When we arrived just before 3 PM (guaranteed check-in time) our room was not ready.    They apologized and escorted us up to their rooftop bar for a complimentary drink-nice touch.   At about 3:30 PM another staff member came up to the bar with our key and to tell us that our room was ready and our bags would be in our room.    We stayed another 10 minutes in the bar (nice view) and went down to our room and our bags were not there.   We called down to reception and they were delivered 10 minutes later.    After putting our feet up for a bit we discovered that the room had no toiletries provided in the bathroom.   Another call to reception and all the soaps etc were delivered 10 minutes later.    So the start to our visit felt a bit like Faulty Towers.

After that poor start the rest of our visit was non eventful except that their computer system was down when we checked so they could not provide a receipt (it was later emailed to us with no unexpected charges).   The main bar, restaurant and lounge is undergoing renovation so we can not comment on any of that.    The room was very nice and other than the first day problems we had a good stay as the location of the hotel is very convenient for theater and sight seeing.    

We visit London every spring for 4-5 nights and hoped to make this hotel our first choice; we have another 1 night visit booked in June 2019 and hope that the whole hotel will be up and running and that we can avoid those small but aggravating check-in problems.   We will see-",3,2019,05,08
145,great location,"ideally suited for all touristy parts of London. I had previously stayed there a couple of years ago but it has been refurbished since then. Very attentive staff especially at reception. Our room was lovely and had a split level with a seating area. Bathroom fully equipped with Molton Brown toiletries and a brilliant shower. I do agree with other reviews I have read about the fact that although the rooms have been refurbished the old cupboards and wardrobes are still there, just locked. Breakfast was on the roof and was the only negative part. I did not think the breakfast enhanced their profile. I found it quite bland and at £18 was not cheap. Also if you wanted something extra e.g. eggs benedict etc. it was a further £5.",5,2019,05,08
145,Love like adore,I love everything and I don’t have any complaints and the location was just perfect and there is a very good view on London eye from the rooftop I like it and I will recommend all my friends to try to visit it,5,2019,05,07
145,Perfect hotel for the theatre district,"Hotel staff was very accommodating. Room was spacious, quiet and clean. Their restaurant is celiac friendly. Wait staff was eager to help. Late evening drinks at the rooftop bar provided a breathtaking view of the city. ",5,2019,05,07
145,Amazing hotel - perfect location!,"My wife and I stayed here on our honeymoon and absolutely loved it! The room was SO spacious and it was one of the most comfortable beds we've ever slept in. Loved the in room iPad for ordering food, the wifi was solid, and my wife LOVED the makup counter mirror/light in the family room. It was the perfect hotel for our European honeymoon.",5,2019,05,04
145,Fantastic and highly recommended,"I stayed with my two children (11 and 13) in The Trafalgar St James for three days / two nights. The location is great and the hotel bar has a fabulous view over the square. Ideal spot for enjoying the city. Extremely friendly staff, nice spacious room, delicious breakfast. We had a great time and I can highly recommend this hotel",5,2019,05,04
145,Perfect Stay at The Trafalgar St. James,"My wife and I stayed in a St. James King Room during our recent stay in London. We loved the location. At Trafalgar Square with easy access to the tube and easy walking to so many great sights. The staff is beyond friendly and helpful, keeping our luggage before our room was ready and also after checkout as we had some time to kill before our train departure. There are so many great places to eat nearby, especially given the prime location near Piccadilly, Soho, and Covent Garden.  

The fitness facility is great and very functional. The complimentary mini bar with assorted beverages is a huge plus! The hotel is super modern and trendy; we loved the design theme throughout! Hallways smelt great, which is a weird thing to say, but no one likes walking into a hallway and smell something funky. 

Overall, we were beyond impressed and happy with our choice to stay here at a Curio Collection Hotel.",5,2019,05,01
145,The best hotel in central London...,"This hotel is fantastic for a number of reasons: location, staff and a factastic view of London from The Rooftop. We had a magnificent stay there last week, and I would stay at this hotel time after time. Rooms are spacious, extremelly clean and include several ammenities. Our experience was great during all the stay.",5,2019,04,30
145,2nd Stay - Same Fantastic Experience,"Again, the staff was fantastic from the waitstaff at the rooftop restaurant to the helpful concierge (especially Ippy) and bell staff. This hotel has every detail figured out and the location across from Trafalgar square is tough to beat.  Highest recommendation.",5,2019,04,30
145,Amazing hotel,"I can not say enough nice things about this hotel. Staff was so friendly.  Rooms were large, clean and luxurious. Location was perfect for us 15 min walk to big Ben or piccadilly circus, and across street from national gallery",5,2019,04,28
145,Fantastic location but everything else average ,"I booked here for my husband as a Christmas present as we were booked to see a nearby musical. I booked here based on the good trip advisor reviews. 

The location is absolutely perfect, in the middle of everywhere with embankment, china town, Piccadilly, White House, convent garden etc all in easy walking distance. 

Apart from that, I have to say we were quite disappointed. Considering this is supposed to be a 5 star hotel, it didn’t feel it and for what we paid, felt it was overpriced. 

When we arrived, we were not acknowledged at all and waited for a good 5 minutes before checking in. Check in staff were clinical but didn’t seem to have much personality. The cleaning staff we came across all seemed very friendly in comparison. 

The corridors and other areas of hotel were all very clean and decorated to a high standard. 

The rooms themselves were very clean and had everything you needed. The free mini bar was a nice touch-they had water, Coke and chocolate. Also the coffee machine was good but we did not use. The large bed was very comfortable and we both did sleep well as the rooms were very well soundproofed. The wall in shower was lovely and the free Molton brown toiletries were nice. 

We went up to the rooftop bar after the theatre but was a bit disappointed that we could not sit outside so could not appreciate the lovely view. Sure that it would be lovely on a nice night. Cocktails were nice but very expensive. 

There was a lovely man on concierge-really friendly and chatty. 

Overall can’t knock the location but not sure we would return as was just missing something for us and felt expensive for what it was. You definitely pay for the convenient location. ",3,2019,04,28
145,Great hotel,"Very clean and new hotel everything was amazing the service and the location, also the room was amazing so quiet and relaxing ambiance... I’ll come back!  If you are in London that’s the place ! 5 star hotel! ",5,2019,04,27
145,"Excellent location, a very nice and clean hotel","Me and my sisters stayed at the hotel last week and what a treat! The rooms are big, the beds are huge and comfortable, nice pillows and absolutely no street noise even if we had rooms at the first floor up. The breakfast on the rooftop bar was very nice and fine, only remember to take your sunglasses if you are sensitive to light. It gets very bright in the morning sun. 
The only downside for me was that you had to take the elevator even if you are only going one floor up. Everything else was very posh😃",4,2019,04,23
145,An Oasis in Central London -- Perfect Location and Great Service,"This property delivers:  our five-night stay here was outstanding.  The location, right off Trafalgar Square is perfect.  You can walk to the bus or tube (Charing Cross-Bakerloo Line) in 3-4 minutes.  Buckingham Palace is a lovely 15 minute walk through the adjacent park, as is Whitehall, 10 Downing Street, and The Churchill War Rooms.  Soho and China Town are a 10 minute walk.  The National Gallery and Portrait Gallery are both right across the square.

Okay, now on to the actually hotel.  The staff here deliver their 5 Diamond service in a  professional and quiet way without falling all over you.  Our room (523) was lovely; spacious by city standards with a large bathroom, complete with soak-tub and stand-up shower.  Molton Brown bath products in use.--  All of the rooms are sound-proofed, both inside and out. There you are, right on Trafalgar Square, and you never heard a sound.  Bed and linens were first-class and outstanding.

The complimentary mini-bar (replenished daily) and Nespresso maker are a nice touch.

The breakfast on the roof terrace was lovely and the staff couldn't have been kinder or more attentive.  Try one of the Eggs Benedicts or the salmon on toasted-rye with avocado.  Great way to start the day.

As a Hilton Diamond member we received all of our benefits and more.  THANK YOU!

A lovely stay, in a great location.  We'll be back!  Ta!",5,2019,04,21
145,Location good - almost everything else mediocre,"On the corner of Trafalgar Square, this is a good location for central London shopping and sightseeing and the proximity to several tube stations makes getting around the city fairly easy - unless you take a taxi! Traffic management in this area is so bad that it can take 15 minutes to get from the Mall to the hotel - a 2 minute walk.

The hotel itself leaves much to be desired. Rooms are fine though those on the 5th floor have small windows and feel gloomy. However housekeeping is really erratic. The minibar was only partly replenished most days and toiletries were either not replaced or the wrong item was left. 5 bottles of body lotion but no shampoo dont make for a good hair wash. The rather silly tablet needed to order room service was left unplugged and was dead on arrival.

Even worse is the food. Breakfast in the rooftop bar was thoroughly unpleasant. They play loud bad music and the hot food is cold. Avocado toast is a dollop of grey/green mush on soggy toast with no taste at all (what happened to the lime, chilli, coriander etc ?). 

Room service is really bad - since when were rubbery brie and camembert artisan british cheeses?

In this price range there are much better central london hotels.",3,2019,04,19
145,Overall Amazing!!!,"The rooms were a really nice size! They greeted us when we first arrived and helped us with our bags. The staff made sure we understood everything and were everything was. They also helped with suggestions on things to do for the day. Clean rooms, good food, amazing front desk, and an awesome location!! We could walk to Buckingham Palace, Big Ben, Westminster Abbey, and more! Trafalgar Square is beautiful!!! ",5,2019,04,14
145,Meeting a friend in London,"Location is fantastic to get around the city by foot or by transit , close to everything 
Hotel  is Good 
Concierge was amazing at recommending restaurants, tours to take and booking car service 
Breakfast was fantastic ",4,2019,04,11
145,Last night of spring break,"We truly enjoyed our stay at the Trafalgar St. James London. The room was spacious, well-appointed, and very clean. The staff exceeded our expectations. The location can not be beat! I would highly recommend this hotel!",5,2019,04,09
145,Trafalgar St James,"We spent a week in London staying at the St James and had an excellent time.  We arrived jet lagged in the AM and when we arrived at the hotel, we were quickly checked in to allow us some time to sleep.  That was a pleasant surprise as we expected to leave our bags and have to return in the afternoon.  The service for the rest of the week continued at this level.  Our stay included breakfast in the restaurant, and we were all impressed with the quality and the staff.  It was a great way to start everyday!  I would definitely stay here again. Friendly staff, very clean rooms and a great location.",4,2019,04,08
145,Wonderful Stay in Central London,"This was our first international trip and our first hotel stay in London. We originally had booked a hotel in Wembley but last minute decided it would be best to stay as close to the local attractions as we could considering we had a limited amount of time in the city. 

This was our first stay in a 5 star hotel. Tom was so helpful in getting us to our room and settled. We were so thankful for his help after a long day of traveling. The room was nice and we didn't hear much city traffic even though we were downtown. Great location to many of the attractions. We had a rental car and the garage to park wasn't too far away. Located within a 5 to 10 minute walk if that. 

Loved having the minibar restocked. It wasn't stocked when we arrived but within minutes someone was there to stock it for us. We ate breakfast off site so I cannot comment on that and we didn't go upstairs to the rooftop bar. Nothing on the menu looked good and my younger children were definitely not into the ""fancy"" food. They wanted pizza and fries. 

The hotel is a bit on the pricey side but we always feel comfortable with Hilton hotels and have had a great experience with staff. They were very helpful with maps and explanations of how to get to interest points. On our next trip to London we plan to stay here again. ",5,2019,04,08
145,Great stay,This hotel was clean. The room had a beautiful floral scent every time we walked it. Housekeeping did an amazing job. Bed very comfortable. Great service. The BEST location. Would definitely stay here again. Wish the cost was a little lower. ,5,2019,04,07
145,Hotell,"Ok Hotell and nice staff in the reception.
Rooms are smal but ok nice beds.
Breakfast.
The Breakfast
Many people work there as staff for service.
But with out leading and plan. Leaving guest in misery. 
Take a consultant help and you will find a fine new potential in this roof top.
Regards.

145,Amazing views,"The rooftop bar here has amazing views! I could sit all day here, you can see over Trafalgar Square and in distance you can see the shard and London eye, drinks are served to you at table and are good, we will be back here, would like to stay next time",5,2019,04,05
145,This is the place to stay.,I took the red eye from Dallas.  They let me check in at 9:30a and sleep.   Great place.  Near everything.   Cool roof.  Great room.  Go to the play “Come From Away”.  Go to soho.    Ride on the London Eye.    All in walking distance. ,5,2019,04,04
145,A Royal Treat,"Booking this hotel was the best decision of our family trip. Working with Ibby, the concierge, helped make our stay memorable. He helped secure theatre tickets and reassured us of our plans and gave us plenty of options. Adrian was also fantastic as was our breakfast waiter. The breakfast was delicious and what a way to start our touring looking over London from the rooftop. 
It was our anniversary and they acknowledged our special day! 
Best part for our family was the room. It is almost impossible to find a two queen rooms abroad yet this hotel has it all. Large comfy beds, spacious bathrooms and the view of Trafalgar Square. We think the hotel is in the greatest location for touring the city. Close to everything and walked everywhere. We definitely stay there again! ",5,2019,04,04
145,Excellent; lots of comforts!,"Very friendly, attentive staff. Complimentary mini bar and in room coffee/tea. Clean and very comfortable rooms and overall facility. Excellent staff in all sectors. Restaurant was under Reno but beautiful roof top bar / restaurant was well established. ",5,2019,04,03
145,A Fabulous Hotel,Great experience from check-in to check-out! We were staying in London for my Husband's Birthday and they really did make the stay special. We stayed in a King room which was a great size and very comfortable. The free mini bar with soft drinks and snacks was a nice treat. We had a night cap in the Roof Top Bar overlooking Trafalgar Square which was a great way to end the evening. Thank you for a fabulous stay :),5,2019,04,03
145,"Great location, clean rooms","Very well located hotel, walkable distance to many attractions, shopping and restaurant. Rooms was clean and spacious with complimentary mini bar. Very modern and chic hotel. Must visit the rooftop bar where you can have an overview of Trafalgar Square. There's a parking at the back of the hotel but parking is quite expensive, if you are driving in city area do remember to chk for a congestion charge fee in London. Would recommend friends at this hotel! Thank you for the wonderful stay! ",5,2019,04,02
145,Excellent Stay,"Excellent service from the staff.  Quiet room and very clean.  All in all a great experience that I would do again.  When the bar and restaurant open later this year, this will be a top location.  Roof top bar was nice, but not large.  ",5,2019,04,01
145,When in London ...,"This hotel offers everything!  Fantastic location, Hilton/Curio Collection 5* standards for customer service and amenities, sumptuous beds, and the best rooftop for taking in the London skyline over post theatre cocktails or your morning coffee and croissant.  Will definitely return!",5,2019,03,29
145,Very Nice,"We stayed here for 6 nights for a family vacation in London. Terrific location, very friendly and helpful young staff. Well appointed with nice rooms and facilities, including nice small gym. Very clean with exceptionally fast room tidying. The breakfast in the restaurant is excellent but the service in the restaurant is pretty horrific despite a lot of wait staff. Baffling for an otherwise very well run place. We were very happy.",5,2019,03,28
145,"Great location,large rooms and wonderful staff.","The hotel staff was helpful in every way from check in to concierge staff to room service. Best location in the city in my opinion. Will highly recommend hotel. Very, very quiet and we were on Trafalgar Square side.",5,2019,03,25
145,"5* decor, 1* staff","Myself and my wife visited as part of a group of around 38 for a birthday celebration. I can safely assume that in excess of £15k (probably £20k+ in reality) was spent as part of this through 15+ rooms for multiple evenings, a four course private dining lunch with drinks reception and wine throughout, and a drinks reception in the evening after we had been to the theatre. If i was management aware of this, I would want people looking after! 

On arrival at around 1:30pm (lunch to begin at 2pm) the staff on reception didn’t seem to have a clue what was going on. We were simply told that we could not check in at that time and to come back later. We had to call some friends who then directed us down to the private room, reception holding our cases. Not a great start and certainly not a welcome to expect of a 5* hotel. 

The drinks reception was well received but the meal itself was average. The tomato soup was great but the most over cooked piece of dry chicken accompanied by a piece of green something (spinach maybe?) and absolutely nothing more was appalling. Almost every single person near me with the chicken pulled a face of disgust on first taste. Unfortunately no one felt they wanted to complain as a guest of the birthday party.

In the evening we returned to the rooftop bar where some space was reserved and another drinks reception. We had a great evening in wonderful company  but my bank balance took a huge hit with circa £18 cocktails plus 10% service charge. 

The room we had was well decorated and furnished with 5* touches such as a tablet, free mini bar and molten brown toiletries. 

We had to get new room cards as they would not work in the lift. On returning to reception to inform them I was told as if stupid that I have to touch the room card on the pad. They didn’t seem to want to know that I knew this, and had already tried this, but it didn’t work. I backed down to try again, obviously it still didn’t work and only then (after been trapped in the lift for the second time with various people to other levels as it doesn’t reject your card straight away, only failing to open the door at your level) would they change the cards. A process of 15 minutes at least that should have been dealt with immediately. Immensely frustrating! 

Breakfast was another let down considering the hotels 5* status. The sun was beaming yet they insisted on what I can only describe as patio heaters to be turned on full alongside the greenhouse effect from the sun. I had the avocado on toast which did not have a stitch of seasoning but was ok once added. An American couple next to me had to complain about the muffins arriving un-toasted. We were forgotten about with regards our drinks. My wife’s black pudding was probably cooked for all of 10 seconds, it was fridge cold in the middle. The bacon however was very tasty, as was the sausage and scrambled eggs. 

Check out seemed to be just a process of “have you spent anything else we need to bill you for? No! OK bye!”. In truth, we couldn’t wait to leave so I was quite happy to be abruptly dismissed, but it was just another example of staff that have no place in hospitality and need out performing or some serious training. 

",2,2019,03,23
145,"Beautiful hotel, shocking service by staff which totally ruined a special occasion ","We stayed at this hotel last weekend for my brother in laws 60th birthday. My sister arrived on the Thursday and left Sunday and despite her spending thousands of pounds at this hotel booking private dining for 36 people, rooms and drinks receptions for her husbands special birthday- the hotel failed to say even happy birthday to him. They did however send a happy 60th birthday to one of the other guests, who’s birthday it was not. I am sorry but this is absolutely shocking. 

On arrival (as I travelled down on the Saturday) I spoke to a guy as I walked in who looked like the concierge, I introduced myself and explained we were staying, there was a private dinner booked and could I be taken to my sisters room as I needed to do her hair and makeup, I gave him the room number and her name. He abruptly said this was not possible and I needed to get it touch with her myself. I am not sure why he could not ring up to the room to check it was ok for him to take me up as she could not come down as she was in a robe waiting for me, I found this poor customer service for a supposed 5 star hotel. We had to get in touch with my brother in law to meet us and take us up. 

The hotel itself is beautiful and decorated to a high standard, the staff at the meal were great and very attentive, although the chicken main was very poor and extremely dry. The food I would rate a 5/10 on whole it did not blow me away. 

At breakfast the next day I gave our room number and the waiter kept looking at the wrong number on the sheet, 3 times I told him the number and I had to physically point to it on the sheet. He then sat us under some really warm heaters and took our coffee order. I asked 3 people to turn down the heater but yet it was left on, we could not tolerate the burning heat so took it upon ourselves to move. 25 minutes later still no coffee, he looked at us and remembered and went to fetch it. Breakfast was poorly seasoned and quite average. 

Overall I was hugely disappointed in this hotel, and the fact was it was the poor attitude and service by certain staff members. If your looking to have a memorable special occasion do not go here, as they clearly do not have the competence to even send a card to the correct person and tainted last weekend and upset my sister who had tried to organise everything perfectly. 
",1,2019,03,21
145,"Super Comfortable Hotel, Super Convenient Location","We chose Trafalgar St James based on location -- we wanted to be central and close to Her Majesty's Theatre -- and this proved to be a great decision. From the moment we stepped out of our taxi, we were made feel welcome and valued as guests and this trend continued through our two night stay.  Most importantly, the room was super comfortable, spacious, and with quality amenities provided.  There was a pod coffee machine and water (also, I think, soft drinks) provided at no cost.  Also a plate of delicious macarons as our welcome gift as a Hilton Honors Gold member. 

We slept so well, due to the comfortable bedding and the quiet.  We did not hear any city, traffic or other guest noise at all.  Also made use of the bath after returning from a cold, wet day out.  The bathroom was stocked with Molton Brown products.

Breakfast during our stay was served in the Rooftop Bar as the main restaurant floor is being refurbished.  Delightful to eat with a splendid view of Trafalgar Square and the London skyline.  The buffet quality was first rate.  The renovations meant that our one meal -- a quick bite before theatre -- was served in the significantly less spectacular Biblio room which resembled a Club lounge.  It was not good value for money but that was our only disappointment.",5,2019,03,21
145,Faultless ,"Visited in March with my sister.  We had a great time and this hotel is absolutely faultless.  The staff are friendly and very helpful, rooms are spotlessly clean and comfortable.  We could not ask for more.  We look forward to visiting again. ",5,2019,03,18
145,Simply the BEST,"I am in the middle of 9 wonderful amazing nights at The Trafalgar. Let me just say service is above any place I have ever stayed. Prior to coming Tom, one of the concierge planned so many excursions, trip etc. He emailed me perhaps 20 times with valuable plans and tickets. Upon my arrival, Ibby has taken over and scheduled as well. Friendly, knowledgeable and just above and beyond on every aspect. A friend recommended Trafalgar and I can’t thank her enough. Thank you staff for making our stay in London so special.",5,2019,03,17
145,Great hotel in an accessible location,"Great stay from start to finish.  Beautiful facilities and amenities.  We did not get to enjoy the dining areas since they were undergoing renovations but the public areas of the hotel were really nice.  Loved our room.  We had a spacious double queen guest room, which worked well for our family.  The bathroom was comfortable for adult and kid use.  I would return in the future and recommend the hotel to friends and family.  The location is quite superb as it is walking distance to some great local dining and attractions.  It is also close to the tube station, the hop-on-hop off bus tour and city buses as well.  ",5,2019,03,15
145,Wonderful,"My husband and I booked here for my 50th birthday celebrations, we had an amazing time, the staff were very professional, not only is the hotel chic and leaves you wanting for nothing, they also gave me a lovely birthday surprise of the most amazing chocolate cake and macaroons beautifully presented along with a bottle of wine - this lovely touch really added to my special treat.  We will be back, already looking to book in December, this is a must for anyone who likes to feel a touch of luxury, central and ideal for anywhere",5,2019,03,12
145,still a great location,"the location is perfect for us, very central London and easy taxi route. The hotel is having some refurbishment so the lower bar was closed, add that to the not so friendly staff on the roof terrace and this stay was not like the first. The main staff in the hotel are great but anyone we had contact with this weekend was ' difficult' as want for another word. Apart from that all was great, the bed is very comfortable and the rooms spacious ( room 512/516/518) on this stay. We were there three nights and all in all good - but the roof terrace bar the receptionist up there needs a course in customer care.",4,2019,03,11
145,"Great hotel, fantastic location","The hotel itself is beautiful with very clean, comfortable  and modern rooms. The hotel does run regular fire drills at 11am, so this might be a concern for anyone trying to sleep in late. The location is fantastic, walking distance from most attractions and across from busses and metro stations. The staff went above and beyond to make my stay comfortable and memorable. This hotel absolutely exceeded all of my expectations and will definitely be my go-to hotel for future visits to London.",5,2019,03,09
145,"Location, location, location!","Center of the city.Accessible to everything!Walking distance to Buckingham Palace, live entertainment and great restaurants!The staff was very knowledgeable about the area. The view from the rooftop was excellent ",5,2019,03,05
145,Excellent central London hotel,"Stayed just for one night for a theatre break and anniversary. Excellent central location. Immaculate clean and beautifully designed hotel. Very spacious rooms - I mean seriously large rooms that you do not expect in central London. Hotel surprised us with elegant desert, bottle of champagne and rose petals on the bed once we came back from the theatre for our anniversary. Breakfast selection is slightly small in comparison to other upmarket Hilton hotels, but it's appropriate for business type hotel.",5,2019,03,03
145,Your luxurious home in London,"Having traveled to may parts of the world, I can say that the Trafalgar St. James is a perfect choice in London. It is close to everything--restaurants, museums, theaters, pub-hopping, sight seeing and transportation.",5,2019,02,28
145,Guys long weekend in London,"When traveling to London I usually stay at the Conrad St James but decided to try the Trafalgar.  We were very pleased with the quality and location of the hotel.  I was impressed by the soundproofing and black-out curtains in each room.  I couldn't hear any street noise even though it's very busy around the hotel.  The bar overlooking Trafalgar Square is a great place in the evening.  The rooftop restaurant for breakfast is great and the service spot-on.  I liked the short walking distance to Covent Garden and the West End.  The Conrad is still great but, now I have another option.",5,2019,02,27
145,Charming Property in a Fabulous location,This property has style and charm. My room was very comfortable and the staff was extremely friendly. The rooftop restaurant was a great find with fantastic views. Loved the proximity to the Tube and local sites.,5,2019,02,26
145,Exceeded expectations,"Our first time in London.  Went to visit my son studying abroad. Stayed 6 nights. Was hestitant to book at first based on mixed reviews I saw.  This hotel was such a pleasant surprise!  Perfect location with easy access to tube station across street or 5 min walk to Embankment Station.  Very close to Buckingham Palace, 15min walk to Covent Garden or London Eye.  Room was very nice, large and comfortable. Had a sitting area with dressing table. Very clean, modern and nice view of Trafalgar Square.  Staff was so nice, helpful and professional. Interacted daily with 3 different concierge staff during stay who were all beyond helpful and always had a smile. They were thorough and patient with the many questions I had.  Helped with tube navigation, attractions tix, restaurant reservations etc.   Same helpful, pleasant service daily from the hosts, wait staff, and cooks at the rooftop breakfast restaurant.  Added bonus the view was beautiful!  Such a lovely way to start each day!  Reception and cleaning personnel were also very nice, attentive and professional.  Highly recommend this hotel and we will definately stay here again on our next visit.  Everything was beyond expectations from the room, staff and location. Thank you for making our first London experience so enjoyable!",5,2019,02,25
145,Return Visit After Several Years Away,Stayed here with my wife a couple of times many years ago and loved it just as much this time as we did previously.  Can't beat the location and the hotel itself is in immaculate condition.  Super clean and very comfy beds.  Would definitely stay again.,5,2019,02,23
145,"Location, Location, Location",Love this area. Upgraded from the ' hub by premier inn' last year's visit to this hotel. While I liked the hub I wanted more room and was willing to pay. I really enjoy staying in this area for LFW.  I didn't even mind that the main restaurant and bar was under construction.,5,2019,02,20
145,Another wonderful stay at the Trafalgar,"From check in to check out you will be surrounded by Team Members who care about your comfort and experience at their property. Location directly on Trafalgar Square allows you to be in the center of everything; easy walking distance to the most popular sites of Central London, but within easy reach of multiple Tube stations as well as bus stops at your door. Even though you are at bustling, noisy location, you would never know it thanks to the windows.  Only the very loudest of sirens penetrated and our room directly overlooked the Square.
More than adequate amount of plugs for your devices.
Our room had an enormous soaking tub along with separate shower. Fan of Molton Brown toiletries?? Then you will love the mini bottles of Molton Brown for your shampoo, body lotion, body wash and conditioner!
Due to the short stay on this trip we did not dine or visit the Rooftop bar (which I highly recommend).
Are there less expensive places to stay in an already expensive city? Yes there are. But if you wish to treat yourself for a special occasion or simply want to be treated well in the center of it all, you will Love the Trafalgar",5,2019,02,18
145,Perfect romantic evening ,So I’ve been wanting to show my partner this rooftop for so long and after the refurb it was well worth the wait massive thank you for Sam I think her name was maybe sally not 100 percent sure but she manage to get us a reservation what was the start of a perfect night  we went up to the bar and Tyson who served us was really Friendly and welcoming  between the two of them my night couldn’t  have got any better a defo must see pace to go for a romantic hangout and spectacular view I will be back for definite ,5,2019,02,17
145,Just Perfect!,From start to finish our four night stay was wonderful.  The staff were attentive to all of our needs.  The room was beautifully maintained with the complimentary items (including the tea!) replenished on a daily basis and the location simply cannot be beat!  My wife and I loved everything about this hotel and would highly recommend!,5,2019,02,13
145,"Stunning hotel, with service to match it","Booked the hotel for one night as an early Valentines day treat for my partner and I, and the few things I have to mention are:
- Location is fantastic and the rooms have this lovely luxurious feel
- Bruno upon arrival was an absolute star, he upgraded us to a King room and also had no issue to check us in ahead of time at around 1pm. We want to thank him again for allocating such a lovely room and for his outstanding service 
- Tyrell in the Trafalgar Dining Rooms looked after us and we also want to give him a shout out for being ever so helpful, a great host overall, and he is a credit to you.

All in all I was most pleasantly impressed with the service throughout, it's the most memorable detail. Your staff are great :)
Cannot recommend this hotel enough and hope to be back soon to try out the rooftop bar as well (sadly it was closed while we were there).",5,2019,02,13
145,Lovely hotel,"We stayed here for one night for a theatre trip. The hotel is in a fantastic location, right on Trafalgar Square close to all attractions.
We arrived early and was surprised and happy to find our room ready. I was slightly annoyed that a security deposit was took on my credit card, but apparently this is common practice. 
The room was lovely, well equipped and spacious. Espresso machine, internet access with a tablet, mini bar with water and soft drinks, molton brown toiletries, bathrobe and slippers. The bed was one of the most comfortable I’ve ever slept in, absolute bliss.  
Was disappointed we didn’t get a room with a view, we faced an office block, but this wouldn’t deter me from staying again or highly recommending this hotel. 
Thank you to all the staff we met, friendly and attentive. All had a smile and a hello and made us feel welcome.
Really hope we can return soon.",5,2019,02,11
145,Loved this hotel. Absolutely outstanding.,"I stayed at the St. James for a weekend in London. A small ""boutique"" hotel, it was the perfect balance between being intimate without being suffocating. The room and bathroom were spacious and the staff was excellent. A special shout out to Bruno who checked us in and Rosie who checked us out. Both showed outstanding customer service. The only downside of this hotel is (a) you can't open the windows and get fresh air (and the heating in the room was very strange) and (b) the fitness room, while spacious and clean, could definitely use a bit more equipment (a stationary bike, for example, would be nice!). I'd happily return.",4,2019,02,11
145,"Excellent Hotel, Fantastic Location, Great Staff","Absolutely loved our rooms at the Trafalgar St. James - windows were double paned leaving the room cozy and really quite (I was on the fourth floor)! Room was also very spacious & comfortable (I had an upgraded Nelson Double Room). The hotel itself is in a great location in Trafalgar Square, right across from the National Gallery. Staff were super friendly and breakfast was great! Dinner was a bit hit or miss, one night it was great (had the burger) the next not so much (ordered steak) but staff was so friendly and gave us a discount for the night we didn't enjoy it as much.",5,2019,02,11
145,Overrated,"My main disappointment with the hotel was the staff- most of those I encountered made me feel like an inconvenience rather than a welcome guest. Check-in was particularly awful- my guest arrived before me and despite having all the details was not checked in until I’d been dragged out of a meeting to verify their identity? The hotel itself is fine - the bar, restaurant and rooms are a good standard. Don’t expect any extras though, there is a tiny gym and no executive space. I wouldn’t stay again - in the price bracket there are many superior options in the Hilton range. ",2,2019,02,11
145,Great location,"Excellent boutique hotel. Great service, with a lovely room and good shower, fantastic breakfast food & wide and varied choice. Location is amazing, next to Trafalgar Square, but still quiet, but no views.",5,2019,02,10
145,Best service and hotel in London,"The staffs are friendly, helpful and welcoming, it’s like home away from home, my daughter and I had a wonderful time staying in this hotel, definitely will be back, thanks again to all the concierge , front desk, restaurant staffs and housekeeping staffs made our trip the best experience and definitely will be back ",5,2019,02,06
145,Birthday overnight stay,"I stayed here overnight Saturday on the 2nd Feb as a special treat for the start of my mothers 90th birthday celebrations and the whole experience was wonderful.  From the check in staff, to the concierge, to the bar staff to the cleaner everyone was friendly and helpful and nothing was too much trouble.  The hotel itself and our room was spotless and we were lucky to have a view of Trafalgar Square.  The kingsize bed was very comfortable, great powerful shower and the toiletries from Molton Brown were lovely.  When we first got to our room a bottle of proscecco and macaroons and a birthday card had been left which was such a lovely gesture.  We wanted to go up to the rooftop bar but January/February due to the weather it is closed but we were able to go up Sunday morning to have a look and see the views and it is somewhere we will definitely go back for.  We had a delicious cocktail in the evening in the bar after we had been to the theatre and when the managers found out it was my Mums birthday two free glasses proscecco were given to us as well as a chocolate cake.  Such friendly staff.  We are definitely coming back for another weekend stay this time in the warmer months.  The hotel is in such a wonderful position and as it was such a beautiful day on the Sunday we had a stroll down The Mall and through St James Park.  I would highly recommend  this hotel and as I said cant wait to come back again.",5,2019,02,04
145,Wonderful hotel,"Rooms are large in size with an extremely comfy bed, bathroom also large with a big bath & separate shower, lovely products & Nespresso coffee!  Fantastic cocktails in the bar & a delicious breakfast!  Staff are all super friendly & knowledgeable!  Highly recommend.",5,2019,02,03
145,Top-notch hotel in Trafalgar Square,"I was overwhelmed by the newly refurbished Hilton Trafalgar square. I love the fashion trendy style, I love my room (see the pic). Comfort, silence in the room and bathroom really at a high standard. Molto Brwon toiletries are the right touch of style. The restaurant provides with a large range of choice, unfortunately, the hot dished are not included in the Diamond complimentary breakfast and not so clearly stated as is or not included, not an issue but it would be nice to make the client aware. The business lounge is not available here so you can enjoy the bar with a view at your costs. Awaiting to be there in summer and try the top floor al fresco bar. thanks",5,2019,02,03
145,A good hotel but not exceptional ,I stayed in this hotel mid week for a business meeting. Reception and check in were very easy and the room was very nice. A nice touch that you can have anything out of the fridge FOC. My issue came the next morning at breakfast when the man seating me couldn’t care less and wanted to seat me right by where the servers cleared tables to. I also had to get up and ask someone to take my order. ,3,2019,02,03
145,"Lovely, Upscale Hotel","This boutique hotel in the Hilton line is conveniently located in Trafalgar Square across from the National Gallery. We were within a 30-minute walk of most London attractions. 

We stayed in both a king room and a junior suite. Both were comfortable, attractive, and well- appointed. The toiletries were Molton Brown, and fizzy & flat water, Coke & Diet Coke, orange juice, milk, and a couple of chocolate bars were stocked in the complimentary mini-bar fridge.  The room also included a pod-style coffee maker. 

The junior suite had a few steps leading up to the sitting area. It also had a large soaking tub in the bathroom. One drawback was that the suite’s stall shower is significantly smaller than the shower in the king room, so must take care not to bang up against either the grab rail or the towel rack inside the door. 

Our only quibble was that the heating control was limited to a few degrees warmer or cooler than the rest of the hotel. Our king room only offered three settings in either direction so the room at night was too warm for our tastes (we prefer ~64 degrees F).  The suite offered almost six settings in either direction, so the temperature was much better. 

The hotel serves a nice breakfast. The food quality is superior to the somewhat haphazard service.  They also have a nice open bar, & the staff was extremely friendly & helpful. Overall, I would happily stay here again.",4,2019,01,28
145,Stylish hotel delivering  luxury that will not break the bank,"We stayed here for a one-night weekend getaway. The staff where simply brilliant - polite and friendly - and no sign of the stuffiness that high end hotels normally ooze.

This is not a run of the mill Hilton. It is quirky and stylish. It is perfectly located for sightseeing and the theatres. Some of the rooms have views over Trafalgar Square.

",5,2019,01,27
145,Martyn lower,Absolutely fantastic hotel. The staff are brilliant. It’s a great location for central London. My whole experience was brilliant. Probably the 4 or 5 time I’ve stayed there. And I’d go back anytime...............,5,2019,01,27
145,Amazing stay!,"Wonderful hotel in an amazing location.  Close to everything and in the center of it all.  Staff was friendly and eager to help you find your way (or to recommend the best places to eat within a short walk).  Complimentary wifi and snacks in the mini bar made it easy to come back to the room, rest, relax and plan the next excursion. Would stay here again and again.",5,2019,01,21
145,There’s Nothing Here to See...,"In the sea of London hotels, this hotel is extremely average at best. 

Although a newer property, the design of the hotel does nothing to help it stand out. London is full of hotels with oddly shaped rooms that aren’t overly ergonomic or well thought out and this hotel is no exception. It truly is a missed opportunity and simply blends in to the landscape of hotels.

The rooms are dark, small, look good in photographs but the reality is more IKEA’esk than luxurious. 

I am a Diamond Member and was kindly upgraded to one of their Trafalgar Suites, which has a going rate of around £400 a night. This over priced room is just that, it’s your typical King Room. It was very average in every way and was in no sense of the word a suite. Being in one of the properties best rooms, I can’t imagine how ordinary all their other category of rooms would pan out. 

For centrally located hotels, at this price point, there are many better properties to choose from. At minimum you can find central hotels that offer the same experience at a much lower tariff. 

Everything about this hotel just made it an overly net neutral experience. 

Their breakfast scheme is both interesting and odd at the same way but essentially isn’t something I personally would be interested in repeating. They offer a small, very small spread of continental breakfast options which are included with most room rates. They offer a menu and you can add on any additional breakfast item for £7 more each. Sounds fairly acceptable except the quality of all their food is quit low and so is the service. When many other properties offer very well thought breakfast menus at again a better price point, I personally couldn’t imagine why someone would be interested in this breakfast. 

During my stay, I also ordered room service. All menu items come from the same restaurant as breakfast and as such kept their course offering low quality food and service. This may not be a concern for some, but for me room service is one of the must haves of any London property I book. My order was incorrect, they fixed but billed my twice for it. Then it was a challenge to have it removed from the bill later. I had the burger, which was awful. It had the texture of a hot dog and tasted much like one.

The staff here are very nice and very well trained but that seemed to be lost due the deficiencies in their product and the overal experience. The location is excellent, which is to be expected when choosing any central London hotel. However Trafalgar Square is a busy place and you will notice it. Sound proofing of the rooms was done well so it won’t disturb your sleep. It will however not go unnoticed once you step outside the hotel. 

The hotel had one unique feature, albeit minor. They offered an electric shower. You simply push a button to start the shower and it did a good job of auto-regulating the temperature. It’s not fancy or doesn’t look any different than a typical shower. It was just unique. However the actual shower inclosure and the bathroom altogether was overly basic and dare I say cheap. The shower floor is plastic, the glass enclosure is small and low quality, so are the tile. Same goes for the bathtub.

In the end, I probably wouldn’t stay at this hote again unless they drastically lowered their price. There are so many better hotels in the same location that are better priced and offer a better experience.",3,2019,01,20
145,Wow what a great surprise,"Right on the corner of Trafalgar Square, great location, easy to get to great restaurants, theatres etc.  Wonderful hotel newly refurbished with highly finished rooms.  Roof top bar, really spacious, great surprise.",5,2019,01,15
145,Pretentious and lacking facilities,"I had big expectations about this hotel but none was met. Location is really premium so if you are travelling for leisure it may be worth staying here, however, not if you are a business traveler.Location is the only benefit of this hotel. Rooms are tiny, hot breakfast is not included (not even a porridge in a cold morning of January - £7) and there is no business lounge. Staff is brilliant but the pretentious hotel policy didn't do it for me. Transferred to another Hilton I had been staying at before mid-week as the lack of service really did not satisfy me. ",2,2019,01,11
145,No Disappointments!!,"Outstanding hotel, close to shopping and many tourist sites. The rooms are clean, well-appointed and comfortable. Cannot say enough about the friendly and always-helpful (with a smile) staff that go above and beyond to ensure your stay exceeds expectations. Although there are several fine restaurants within walking distance from the hotel, the meals at the hotel are diverse, perfectly prepared and delicious. An easy 5-Star recommendation to all.",5,2019,01,07
145,Friends Night in London,"We booked this hotel through Secret Escapes and wasn't disappointed with the facilities or location.  The rooms were spacious and had complimentary dressing gowns and slippers for use.  The rooftop bar was amazing and views on the clear night were fab.
The only thing that let this hotel down was the breakfast, the buffet station was constantly empty and despite asking on numerous occasions for even basic items such as bread and ham they were beyond slow at getting them filled.  We ordered fresh tea and coffee and despite 2 reminders it never appeared.  The tables were half cleared before the person clearing moved on to half do another task?!? 
Management really need to get a grip of that as for a hotel in that location there is plenty of choices to be made",5,2019,01,07
145,Great Hotel- Central Location,"Booked at the last minute so did not know what to expect- and was pleasantly surprised by the overall experience. 
It’s part of the Hilton group and a Curio hotel whatever that means as a brand. 
More importantly the staff were helpful and attentive on check in, the room was clean and well equipped with plenty of space. The bar and restaurant area has a nice atmosphere and the roof top bar is a great place to view Trafalgar Square- but is cold in Dec. 
Would I return- absolutely.
",4,2019,01,06
145,Great Hotel Got Even Better,"Have stayed at this charming hotel several times but this is our first visit since the recent refurb. The bar area and rebranded Trafalgar Dining Rooms are very tastefully presented and in our opinion a huge improvement over the previous configuration. All front of house staff are very friendly and attentive but their style is very relaxed too. Consequently we felt very comfortable in the bar and dining room area. 
Our room was gorgeous. We’d checked in on line before arriving and we were delighted to find our room was ready for us on arrival around 11:30am. The rooms have all been refurbished too to a very high standard. Huge comfortable bed, lovely decor fixtures and fittings and a great bathroom with a very spacious power shower. Little things can make a big difference - when we returned to our room late afternoon there was a selection of freshly made macarons waiting for us - just perfect! One other thing to say about our room (Room number 612) is that it was blissfully quiet. 
Continental breakfast was of high quality and our favourite part of that was the bircher muesli, but there was a good selection to choose from. 
We will definitely return to this wonderful hotel and we strongly recommend it. ",5,2019,01,06
145,Great location,"Very nice hotel with good service and a stunning location, well within walking distance of many tourist sites and shopping. On check in we were asked the purpose of our visit, to which we said it was our 40th wedding anniversary. Within the hour a bottle of bubbly arrived with the hotels compliments a very nice and caring touch.",5,2019,01,05
145,very nice hotel,very great services and the bell was very niced and they help us a lot the hotel is good location near undergroud. Room service also very good and the beef dish was very good taste so we will come back again for sure,5,2019,01,04
145,"Nice room, but not great otherwise","Newly renovated. Rooms good. Ac seems to turn off at night?  Room gets hit and stuffy

On last night decided to have drinks at hotel bar. Got there at 10 and took a table just beside bar. At 10:15 staff were clearing tables all around and setting for breakfast. At 10:30 cranked lights up. We really felt like they wanted us to go.  Not many people, on a Friday night. Maybe 10 or so?  Did not feel welcome.",2,2019,01,04
145,Ideal Location,"What a stunning revitalized property inside and out! You can tell the designers really put thought into every corner of the rooms in terms of design elements. This property really makes a mark as a Curio, and emphasizes what a Curio Collection hotel is. The amenities are wonderful, spacious rooms, high ceilings, great adjustable lighting.
We visited the bar which has great views of the city, though drinks are extremely pricey. The location is also superb, you're a mere few steps away from the Underground making it convenient to head anywhere in the city.",5,2019,01,03
145,Ideal location for exploring central London,"We have now stayed at The Trafalgar St. James twice in the past 4 months.  Both experiences have been top notch!  The customer service provided at the front desk, concierge, bar, and restaurant was excellent.  We truly felt well taken care of.  The rooms feel luxurious and are so quiet you wouldn't even know you are in such a busy part of London.  The rooftop bar has spectacular views and a great selection of cocktails.  Will definitely stay there again!!",5,2019,01,03
145,Location location location,"Stayed here for an early Christmas with the other half. Location cannot be beaten for central London. Everything is walkable. 
Room was lovely and had a view of Trafalgar Square - spacious as we went for a trafalgar king suite. 
However at check in communication was bad and took ages even though we arrived when we said we were going to. Once the supervisor arrived he was great and took care of everything but the initial staff member could’ve communicated what was going on better. (Basically our room wasn’t ready). 
We had breakfast there one morning - nothing special for the price I am afraid! More value to pop outside and get breakfast elsewhere! 
The downstairs bar was lovely and the rooftop bar is very special (book ahead!!)
I’ve stayed at many Hilton’s and other brands and the location is nice, the room was nice but for the money you can get a more ‘special’ experience elsewhere I am afraid. There are a lot of extras that cost money at the Hilton (not even free bottled water unless you’ve reached a certain membership level) and other brands do the extras for no cost for similar priced rooms.",4,2019,01,02
145,Curates egg but ok,"Excellent location, nearest tube 5 mins away (Charing X), City airport just £32 by taxi (with no traffic). Rooms generous, quiet, clean, modern & in good condition. Beds very comfortable. Roof terrace/ bar excellent with great view of the square, service fine. Free minibar (water/soft drinks) but didn’t know ‘till we asked. Tablet provided but a cheap one which didn’t work too well. One day one room wasn’t made up and we ran out of “essentials” twice. Coffee & tea facilities, but no milk, asked 3 times and was assured it would come but never did. Took it myself from breakfast in the end. First 3 days breakfast poor, always something important missing eg orange juice, butter, croissants etc, never replenished despite asking, despite few diners and not late. I would recommend going next door for breakfast, plenty of inexpensive options. Dining room a bit unrefined, not in keeping with the rooms.
However clean quiet and a good sleep was had by all do not too bad.",4,2019,01,02
145,Great Experience,"Spent an enjoyable week at the Hilton Curio Trafalgar Square.

The hotel is located in a great location, is newly renovated, has comfortable and nicely decorated rooms and warm and attentive staff in all departments.  Breakfasts were very good with a nice menu.

While I couldn’t fault the hotel, we were disappointed that the London Underground subway connector tunnel to Charing Cross station, a short distance away was closed. ",5,2019,01,01
145,On the top on the rooftop,"Sharing amazing time on the Trafalgar's rooftop in London with my beloved husband. Wonderful view, company and perfect cocktails: French 75 and side car + edaname beans, raw tuna, crispy duck, corean beef,... mmmhmmm",5,2018,12,30
145,Book now - you won't be disappointed!,"What a gem! Stayed for two nights as a post Christmas treat. Perfect location on the corner of Trafalgar Square and the adjacent QPark car park was great - booked through the QPark website.

Staff were friendly and charming, the rooms a good size with complimentary soft drinks and Nespresso machine, a great shower and unbelievably quiet.

The Rooftop bar with its outdoor terrace and heaters is a hidden gem but be sure to book and be aware of the over 21 rule after 7pm.

Super breakfast which again was included in our deal as was a choice of coffees (latte, cappuccino, etc.) which was a nice touch.

Will definitely be back!",5,2018,12,29
145,Nice hotel ,The staff at the desk was very nice.  The room that I had was great and looked over the square. The room and large and the bathroom was great.  The breakfast was just ok. The staff at the bar at night was slow and seemed a little bothered that I was there. Overall a nice stay.  ,4,2018,12,28
145,50th Birthday Stay,"I recently booked the Trafalgar St James as a base for my 50th Birthday with two other couples (3 rooms), from the moment we arrived everything was fantastic. Our rooms were upgraded, we had a very large room looking directly over Trafalgar Square. The rooms are beautifully appointed with free soft drinks in the minibar, fresh milk and a coffee machine.

The hotel sent up a bottle of champagne, and a card from the manager for my birthday, which was a brilliant gesture and really appreciated. The location couldn’t be better, the staff were amazing, and the concierge was extremely helpful.

Thank you for making my stay so special, I can’t think of anything that was missing, I wish I could stay in this hotel more often.

Please pass on my thanks to the team.",5,2018,12,27
145,top place in a top location,"great place, it is the heart of london, it is about luxury and the place delivers what you need. Bar time also was highly appreciated too. i am already thinking about coming booking again when i am down in london.",5,2018,12,27
145,"Great in places, development needed others","A great hotel in a superb location. Really high quality interior. WiFi went down for a whole morning (not what I was expecting, especially as I had set the time aside to catch up with work things). The Duty Manager did offer me a bottle of wine as an offer or an apology. Fire alarm accidentally went off at 2:50 in the morning. But definitely the most disappointing part of my stay was the the staff at breakfast who were all very grumpy and a few times they would mess up the order. Having said all this I would go again! ",3,2018,12,24
145,Great luxury hotel in London in the heart of the city,"I had a wonderful stay in the hotel on 19.12.2018.
The bar is exiting, the rooms are good and the Service is famous.
All in all a good hotel in the heart of the city.
I will definitely come back in 2020.",4,2018,12,21
145,Cool hotel,"This is hotel is centrally located. The rooms have a good size. The rooms are modern and clean. The breakfast is good but not excellent.
Walking distance to the tube, museums, theater, etc.
Although centrally located, the area gets quiet at night so you can get a good night sleep.",5,2018,12,17
145,Opulent 🥂,"This hotel has an amazing location.
The decor is very tastefully done and has a modern chic look to it. 
The bedrooms are very spacious and spotlessly clean. 
The staff are nice and thoughtful. 
Will Definitely return. ",5,2018,12,17
145,Fantastic View of the City,This is the 2nd time we have been here as a family. Our table was set up on arrival and the views were stunning. We got to see the city all lit up by the Christmas lights. The service was attentive and we enjoyed our drinks. We will definitely be back. ,5,2018,12,17
145,Love the Curio brand.  Good service and value in a great location.,"Lovely hotel right at Trafalgar Square and so close to everything.  Nice clean room although room views aren’t what you expect here.  I had a partial view of Trafalgar Square from my 5th floor room.  Some nice touches like USB ports bedside to charge devices - signs of a modern hotel.  

Service was fantastic at the hotel and only let down at the restaurant where although not bad, derserved a better bedside manner from some of the male staff.  Good value and will come back.",4,2018,12,15
145,"What to say, but....","This hotel is in a great place re the location. Short distance to everywhere. Arriving a bit early I was amazed that the receptionist said that we do our utmost to gwt your room ready. Thank you. What a service and she was also very polite and had a smile. 
My room was great, no dust, well cleaned, bathroom spacious with everything you need, bed was fantastic and air conditioning quiet. Although my windows were facing The Trafalgar Square the traffic noice did not come into the room. So great windows!
The service in the morning at the breakfast was very good and the head waiters superb.
Perhaps in the dinner the music was too loud, but service was good.
The gym, well, that was a small disappointment as I use bike and there was only one, not the normal but like competition tour bike. The room fits with one more bike.
In overall I would fo back to this hotel.",5,2018,12,14
145,Nightclub feel,"Sadly this hotel did not meet our expectations upon check in or after we got to our room.  Much like those hotels in NYC that have a night club on the top floor, this hotel was loud upon entering, heavily fragranced room freshener, dark and just not as appealing as the website pictures suggested.  While the check in staff was great, my husband and I, after looking forward to the trip for so long, decided to move to another hotel.  The unsavory characters that rode down the elevator with us confirmed we made the right decision.  Upon notifying the hotel that we would be checking out (after just an hour or so checked in) we asked that our room for the night be pulled from our Hilton points.  The young lady behind the desk was very kind and said she would make that happen.  Sadly, without going in to too much detail, that never happened and we ended up paying over $300 USD for 2 hours at this room.  I let this go as I understand the policy and we could not get around it.  Howver, the hotel took 76000 of my Hilton points on top of the charge to my credit card.  Several attempts to follow up were met with ""I'm sorry"" and ""we are working on it.""  Several weeks later,  I ended up resolving my self with Hilton Rewards.  If you like the night club vibe, this is probably a great hotel for you. Location is good but we just wanted something a bit more quintessential London.",3,2018,12,12
145,"Good, service a little chaotic","Great location for the sights, Covent Garden and theatreland. Large restaurant downstairs was not especially welcoming, the large bar by the door seemed to be the main attraction, where service was good. Rooftop bar upstairs was great but the service was a little haphazard, as everything seemed to take ages to arrive, although the staff were trying very hard. Rooms were a good size, enough for a small sofa, and well decorated. All in all a very good hotel.",4,2018,12,11
145,The Location cant be beat!,"The property provides an ideal refuge from the hustle and bustle of the area. The best part is you have access to just about the best of London shopping, attractions and dining.
The room product is modern and allows space for all your closet needs and sitting area is an added bonus. Staff again makes the property a true gem..",4,2018,12,11
145,One night stay in the city ,"Great hotel and location if your looking for a place to stay near the theatres. Lovely clean modern rooms and we stayed in a Trafalgar kingroom and booked on secret escapes for £235. Breakfast wasn’t the best experience. They kept running out of everything ie fresh fruits etc as they only had small serving dishes and lots of guests to feed. The scrambled egg on toast I ordered was tasteless sadly. 

Yes we would stay again but I just hope they improve the breakfast offerings.",4,2018,12,10
145,Perfect Location. Exceptional Hotel,"We chose the St. James Trafalger for it's excellent location to attractions around London. This hotel was perfect for us and their customer service and guest relations were exceptional. They were helpful in directing us to attractions, filling our requests promptly and making us feel very welcome. 

We enjoyed Continental breakfast on our plan every morning and there was a nice selection of fruits, fruit juice, pastries, bread, jam and honey, granola and yogurt, nuts, cheese and meats. You also could choose to order off the hot menu.  Lunch was wonderful with many choices.I recommend the Cobb salad. The restaurant and breakfast area also included a bar for a night cap. 

Our room was a King or Junior Suite and featured a King bed, and also a raised platform area that had a couch, table and vanity mirror and stool. Very spacious. Everything was modern and up to date, a true boutique feel to the hotel and rooms.

 We especially liked the rooftop bar which offered bar bites as well. They provide blankets and have heaters on the roof. Make a reservation. William Hunter the Guest Relations Manager did a superb job making sure we were well taken care of during our stay. Thank you for a wonderful time!",5,2018,12,06
145,Gorgeous boutique hotel in the heart of London,"I came upon this hotel last minute and to say I was thrilled when I arrived, barely expresses my sentiment. The property is gorgeous, the staff is attentive yet not overbearing, & I can’t wait to return",5,2018,12,04
145,Wonderful place!!,"In the heart of London city with easy access to everything. Very good impression from the first moment until the last. The style of the hotel is different and so lovely. Efficient, friendly and warm welcome and check in. Hotel has a lovely bar area with very nice staff, nice drinks and some really tasteful things. Room, corridors, bar, restaurant, all of them clean, tidy and cozy. The carpet inside room amazing. Definitely you have to give a try to this hotel.",5,2018,12,01
145,Great Rooms but not 5 Star feel or service,"Positives, the beds are extremely comfortable and the rooms are a decent size for 2 people. There is a complimentary mini bar that has both still and sparkling waters and coke and diet coke. It wasn't fully stocked on our arrival which seemed like an oversight and the other days it was always restocked properly.The concierge and doormen were always extremely helpful and courteous.And the location is very convenient with many things within walking distance and close to two Underground stops.  However the whole hotel feels more like a 3 maybe 4 star hotel. There wasn't a spa, or a nicer restaurant. The Rooftop bar has amazing views and is worth a drink but unfortunately the service there and in the Dining room wasn't great. The Rooftop Bar we had reservations and the host was fantastic, however it took the waitress a long time to come over and take our drink orders and she never came back to check on us. We had to ask the buser for the bill. The Dining Room was a similar story, we had breakfast once and drinks twice. Each time we arrive the host/hostess seemed shocked that someone wanted service despite them being open and other people sitting down. The Dining Room was always cold because of the doors and wasn't very relaxing. ",4,2018,12,01
145,Exceptional quality,"I have been in many hotels in London and sometimes their rating is not exactly consistent with reality. I can honestly say that The Trafalgar St. James’s is my favourite hotel in London so far. The rooms are great, the quality of the service is outstanding and it’s perfectly located just opposite the Canadian embassy.

A small comment for the management: as a gold member with Hilton I’m used to receive free breakfast. When I received the breakfast menu I wasn’t aware that I have to pay for those additional options. I ordered a full English breakfast and I was under the impression that was included in my benefits.",5,2018,11,30
145,Fab,"So disappointed I only booked a one night stay here.  Room was fab,  very comfy bed,  high ceilings,  lovely Molton Brown fragrances throughout the hotel.   I would have preferred a bath but shower was spacious and overall the bathroom was great. Rooftop bar is a must.  Although a cool night in a November,  the blankets and heaters meant we were quite happy to stay there soaking up the night time London skyline.  Breakfast was great. Wouldn’t hesitate to book again.  Very enjoyable stay.",5,2018,11,26
145,Cosy little place!,"I just loved The Trafalgar, St James by Hilton. I will definitely come and stay here next time. It was very close to where I had my meetings at Carlton Terrace and close to the Charing Cross station. The food was good, the room was nice and very clean. The hotel staff was friendly and helpful; on one of the days I needed a quite place where I could have a meeting with 3 of my colleagues and a room was provided within a blink of an eye.",5,2018,11,26
145,All weather rooftop bar with great views ,"With both indoor and outdoor seating this bar offers great views across Trafalgar Square and beyond. Service was friendly and polite. Drinks prices were as expected, (a glass of prosecco was £9). Probably best to book in advance for outdoor tables. I'd certainly go again.",5,2018,11,26
145,An enjoyable stay spoiled.,"Stayed 1 night to attend a function nearby with my company along with other colleagues. Situation of the hotel is perfect and the room very nice. However. Breakfast service and quality was awful, slow doesn't begin to describe it and the quality of the food was terrible. I ordered poached eggs which arrived cold on cold toast after 20 minutes. Sent them back only to wait another 20 minutes again before getting the replacement which was cold also. I gave up eventually and went without. While sitting there we observed numerous others waiting and then sending unpalatable cold food back. An enjoyable stay spoiled.",2,2018,11,26
145,Just perfect!,"Stayed at this great hotel for two nights. Honestly can’t praise it enough both for location and comfort. Location is great, walking distance for shopping, theatres, Buckingham palace and parks, Westminster and Covent gardens. The hotel itself is great, very comfortable rooms, great decor and excellent breakfast. Small complimentary fridge in room with soft drinks, water and chocolate which is restocked daily-nice touch!
Staff were friendly and the concierge were very knowledgeable , all in all had a great time at the hotel and will defiantly return and recommend to friends.",5,2018,11,25
145,The Location is NOT worth this much $ ,"I booked this room mainly for the central location, but also thought that the amenities would be more impressive, especially considering the cost.   We were told when we checked in that breakfast and dinner were included in our price (except drinks, even Cokes) and that also applies to room service.  How convenient, I thought, especially since we had tours planned for every day we were in town.  The breakfast was okay at best.  Tons of bread options, but it was the same thing, just shaped differently (pastries, buns, rolls, etc). The fruit was okay.   You could order off the “hot menu” but it took FOREVER to get the food.  Also, the wait staff did not bring the drinks we ordered.  Water was provided, but we actually ordered drinks other than water that were never delivered to us.    Regarding the dinner, the menu included appetizers, main course and dessert.  The first night, we ordered off the menu.    It was okay.  Not much to chose from. The next night we went back.  The menu was the exact same.  In room dining was the same as well, except that they offered a club sandwich on the in room menu.   We assumed it would be a real restaurant and have many options.   I mean, at least a cruise ship changes its menu every day when only offering certain entrees.  We were EXTREMELY disappointed.  And again, the wait staff just would not bring us drinks!   We had to even ask for water. My husband ordered a beer with dinner and they brought it with his ice cream. (He sent it back telling them that he had wanted it with his meal) The  last night, we just ate at McDonalds, something I told myself we’d never do in another country since we can get McDonalds in the US.   

There is nothing particularly spectacular about this hotel.   The lobby is tiny and cramped.  When you check in, you are practically standing in the restaurant.  

Also, the room was too hot.  I usually freeze wherever we go and my husband burns up, but even I was hot.  None of us slept well because it was so stuffy in the room.  

The rooms were very clean and housekeeping did restock our room daily.  I have no complaints about them 

When we got ready to check out, they had charged us for the meals that they had told us were included.   They did take that off the bill, but what they didn’t tell us was that there was an almost 30 pound “service charge” for every meal that we ate tagged on to the bill.   (And we had tipped the wait staff even though they sucked).   We were NOT happy.  

We will not stay here again.  The location is NOT worth the cost.  ",2,2018,11,24
145,Perfect placed - lovely room,"But - service was really bad and slow.. Breakfast buffet very expencive and lacking even bread and butter. Staff managed to see right through you, NOT helping at all.
Room wasn’t cleaned at 3pm. NOT comming back",3,2018,11,23
145,Fantastic location and amazing place,"We always assumed that we would stay loyal to our previous hotel we used so many times - that was until they increased the prices by 30% with no loyalty program to boot that is worth it’s salt!   Anyway we looked at this Hilton and decided to book!
 On arrival the feel was amazing, beautiful place, well situated and fantastic staff.  The rooms ( we had a suite with a view of Trafalgar Square) are amazing, loads of rooms and the bed offers an outstanding sleep quality.  We went up to the roof bar - what a view - great service also.  The situation is perfect for central London and the tube station - just check it out
  Well, as I started this review, we like to stay loyal - so we booked again for March! ",5,2018,11,19
145,"Wow , amazing service !","Please ignore our previous review if still visible on site. We have deleted it completely.
Issues pertaining to checkin, deposit and room view were efficiently and professionally addressed. 

This is the 5 star service we know and love from our usual chains of hotels the Marriots and IHGs.... but actually, The Hilton really went above and beyond. We have not had this type of amazing service since our Le Telfair stay in Mauritius over 10years ago. 
We are happy customers again and excited to explore London from our base at Trafalgar St James.

We were sat down at our own time and convenience with the guest relations managers Maria and Marta. They really made us feel like we were on our island holiday honeymoon again , with that personal and specialised attention.

They quickly apologised for everything, including the front desk service and small problems, and took immediate measures. They understood our concerns that as holiday makers , we should not have to put up with resistance and difficulty from any of the staff and did explain that some of the desk were trainees. They were really genuine and wholehearted in their approach.

again a thank you to Maria and Marta, for really impacting and changing this part of our stay in London, and making it an experience that we will treasure forever.",5,2018,11,18
145,Good location,"Good location, helpful, friendly staff.  Rooms did not cool enough for restful sleeping.  If you don't mind a warm room to sleep in this would be a good choice for visiting London as its central location makes touring easy.",3,2018,11,18
145,Average,"Stayed for two nights. Had a Trafalgar “Suite”. Not what I would call a suite, actually half a normal room with an odd raised area up to the window. The room was clean but smelt not fresh all of the time, the drain in the shower bad.
Attention to detail is not what I’d expect for the price of £350/night. For example if you use the coffee machine in the afternoon you might expect a new set of cups and extra milk when they come round to turn beds back? You use the one Earl Grey tea bag and it is not replaced?
Had to wait at least 20 minutes for a coffee at breakfast on the first morning. On the Friday night you get a letter saying that on Saturday morning 9.30 -11.00 is busy for breakfast and as the hotel is full and you might not get a table - really??? Sort it out!
Great location. ",3,2018,11,17
145,Good Location but  not value for money.,"Hotel has the great location,that is all that is going on for the hotel, rooms are small. We stayed in the Trafalgar suite,hardly a suite just a larger room with a sofa.Not a suite you would expect it to be when you book in a hotel.The house keeping is lousy,the worst we have ever experienced..the dirty glasses were never removed, the mini bar  only occasionally being filled,there was a tissue/kleenex box on the stand  which remained empty and unreplaced for 4 whole days finally we complained at the reception.Apoligies were issued with a plate of cookies but the next day all was the same so we gave up,decided not to complain again.
Breakfast was nothing to write home about,we had better breakfasts at the London Bankside Hotel and Conrad St James.Breakfast time was a total chaos,I suspect that there was a serious staff shortage.3 different mornings our orders came wrong.Full English breakfast  was not good,twice they were out of white toast,how can a hotel be out of bread I could never understand.If you come to breakfast after 9,30 it will be very likely that the buffet would also be out of fruits,breakfast pastries,etc...they are never replaced..you will get much better breakfast at the Garfunkels restaurant next door(and much cheaper),We paid 600 + pounds for our room which was not worth it.I do not think that we will be staying there again.Oh yes,the location is great but is the hotel worth the money ?",2,2018,11,14
145,Dining Club Lunch,"We were a group of ten gentlement; who enjoy  trying new places, in and around the capital.  First and foremost was the service, which was superb; from the moment we arrived and they took or coats; until we left many hours later - with our coats !
Great ambience and feel about it; plenty of space and great decor.
We chose the Star Lunch, which comes  with three courses and a cocktail.
The quality was very good; personally I enjoyed the smoked salmon, good quality.
On the fixed menu, choice for main, was a little limited. Many of us chose the Bavette Steak; at an extra cost of £5.  Most people enjoyed theirs; certainly the presentation, yet again was excellent. I have now found out that Bavette is French for 'Flank' - far too chewy for me.  Overall;  brilliant; liked the staff and  their attention to detail.",5,2018,11,13
145,Central location ideal for birthday weekend,"Excellent standard of hotel , perfect location next to Trafalgar Square. Lovely birthday weekend with lots of food, wine and fun. 

Would certainly recommend the hotel based on location. Didn’t eat there but drinks in the bar were v good. ",5,2018,11,12
145,"Amazing hotel, central, really comfy beds and superbly decorated","Fab hotel stay for one night whilst going to see Magic Mike, very central for walking and the hotel itself is superb! Delightful decor, great staff, the only minus is the cocktails, prices, even though were used to paying  £9/11 .. charging £16 plus 12% additional is rather steep.  We got back to the hotel at 12.15am and the bar was closing for a night cap, which was a little disappointing as we didn’t want to order room service for one drink.  Lovely for a treat hiwever. ",5,2018,11,11
145,Nice Hotel with Great Roof Bar,"Hotel looked newly refurbished and rooms spacious restaurant and bar all very stylish.
Separate Check in for hotel to roof bar.
We chose the hotel to visit roof bar and made a reservation in advance.
Roof bar is small but has great views over Trafalgar and London skyline lovely place to enjoy a cocktail around sunset. Some nice tables for two and a couple for larger groups.
Breakfast before we left was buffet and table service and had great selection of nice food and was accompanied by attentive service by staff checking all was well.
We had room with inward facing view so not sure if there are rooms with good city views. 
Hotel located just off Trafalgar Square so well located for walking to a number of attractions. 
Concluded this was a very nice well located hotel plenty of places to walk to and not far to tube the staff are attentive and added advantage of a good roof bar.",4,2018,11,11
145,Great hotel...but...,"The hotel is in a great location and it is lovely.  We were disappointed in the service.  Perhaps it was a coincidence, but the service was lacking.  It was all small stuff, but it was a pain.  From robe and slipper issues, to being placed in an accessible room with no bathtub (important to me) the list is long.  
I don’t know if I’ve ever done a review that was less than 5 star, but I felt it was important to share.  We traveled quite a distance and we were looking forward to a soak in the tub, robe and slippers.  Not a 5 star hotel.
I will stay there again.",3,2018,11,08
145,Great central location,"This was a great hotel. Central to everything in London. Safe and easy access to underground transportation. The room was wonderful, clean and updated like new. The check in was easy and staff was very accommodating. The best part was the hotel concierge, he got us reservations and tickets to sold out events. It pays to stay in a nice hotel. Also this hotel has roof top dining and the views were amazing! Highly recommendable",5,2018,11,07
145,Great Location,"Great location, minimal facilities, but excellent for travellers who do not spend much time in the Hotel, and need the location. Front Desk are efficient and allowed me an early entry, as I had emailed them prior to. Although the lady denied this when I booked in, she found a room after i had told her that I had made prior arrangements. Great Hotel if you can get a reasonable price.",4,2018,11,06
145,Excellent location for central London,"I stay regularly, mostly on business, sometimes for leisure. Superb location, excellent service, high quality finishes in the rooms, always spotless. As with most central London hotels, rooms aren't the largest, but these are at least well appointed. Don't compare this to any Hilton (I've used most of them in London as a Diamond member) - it has the character of a quality boutique hotel, with the service of a top international brand. Great bar, breakfast is good, haven't used the restaurant for dinner.",5,2018,11,06
145,Very attentive service for a special occasion,"We arrived earlier than check in as we just wanted to drop off our baggage before heading off to St. Pauls. As I was checking in I was asked if it was a special occasion and I mentioned that it was our 10 year anniversary. When we got back to the room at 15.00 there was a lovely anniversary present of a chocolate brownie and also a very nice personal  note wishing us a great time. It is things like that which my wife and I both appreciate. The room we had was very well equipped, I would have loved a bath tub to be available but that would be my only gripe. I had already booked to have cocktails on the rooftop bar at 5.30 and when we arrived we were given a prime view looking out to the London Eye. Again everyone was very attentive, wishing us a happy anniversary and we also received another complimentary pudding up here. (Though what it was I cannot remember, boy those cocktails are strong!)
Overall I would thoroughly recommend this hotel,  especially the staff.",5,2018,11,05
145,Good but not great,"Stayed here for two nights over a weekend. First impression was that the room was great and smelled fantastic - better than any hotel room I’ve ever stayed in. Comfortable king bed, free mini bar with fresh milk, coffee machine and lots of thoughtful design features that make a difference. Our view was of an inner office courtyard - didn’t bother us particularly but may be an issue for some. As others have mentioned the location is spot on.  We ate breakfast on one morning and it was not great. Hot food took over 40 minutes to arrive, we noticed poor, bordering on rude, service to other guests and ours wasn’t much better. Returning to collect our bags on final day we thought we might have a drink or lunch to be told the virtually empty restaurant was fully booked. After deciding we’d just have a quick drink we sat at the bar and left after 10 minutes with no service offered. Thanks to William the night duty manager who sorted out a noise issue very professionally. We’d visit again but hoping this review and others I’ve read will prompt some action to improve the breakfast experience.",4,2018,11,05
145,75% there..... ,"Visited here with my husband at the weekend.
The hotels position is perfect for some sight seeing!
First impressions - beautifully decorated, the staff were extremely welcoming!
Our room wasn't ready until dead on three o'clock - cut off time and if was very obvious the staff were rushing to make sure it was ready.
The room itself, very nice, very clean. I was dissapointed as there wasn't a bath. Unfortunately the shower leaked and made a large pool by the bathroom door.
I have never stayed in a hotel in England where there is no milk for tea, something you had to ask for. Limited amount of tea bags, again had to ask for extra. Unfortunately the language barrier with staff did make things more difficult than it should be. Asked repeatedly for extra English tea bags, each time we recieved phone calls asking us whether we had recieved our bags (as in luggage) after 45 minutes we did eventually get two tea bags!
The bed was huge and very clean, lovely bed linen. The Molton brown accessories were a nice touch.
One major issue- husband was having a shower, I was getting dressed - member of staff just walked straight into our room! Didn't knock, just walked straight in, it was a shock to say the least! Have to admit it made us feel very uncomfortable after this!
We slept very well. 10-10am house keeping was knocking at the door, I made a dash to the door to open it after being in the shower to ensure they didn't just walk in! Surely house keeping have a list of which rooms have checked out to know which rooms to clean!??
Breakfast - not good at all. Not at all worth £25 per head! Waited ten minutes to be seated whilst the limited staff raced around trying to tidy tables, waited 15 minutes no sign of any member of staff coming over for us to order tea let alone food! We had to find a waitress ourselves.
20 minutes for food to arrive, it was stone cold!! After being in the restaurant nearly an hour we just wanted to go as it was wasting our last few hours in London. Looking at the list in reception we were the fifth person to complain and we did recieve a refund for breakfast no questions asked. We were absolutely baffled as in the afternoon there are staff everywhere but in the morning serving breakfast we only saw 3 people. Just doesn't make sense.
On the whole it was a nice stay, happy staff, clean rooms - but the lack of privacy and breakfast was an absolute no no! ",4,2018,11,05
145,Recommend - dont miss rooftop bar,"As others have stated, its hard to beat this location. I had a handicap queen, which was all that was available when I checked in, and it was a very small and very dark room, which I would not recommend. The bed, however, was very comfortable. Breakfast was great, with either a buffet or full menu. The staff at this hotel is outstanding. Dont miss the rooftop bar, but go early or late, it gets busy. The view across the city is stunning.",4,2018,11,04
145,Amazing location in central London,This hotel is perfectly placed. The rooms are clean and well presented. All the staff are very welcoming and friendly. Lovely cocktails in the bar in the evening with friendly pleasant bar staff. The breakfast was very good too .,4,2018,11,04
145,Excellent view and cocktail at rooftop bar,"I booked in advanced at 4:15pm I got in and amazed at the actual view on the balcony. Not only me, many other customers got in also has same screaming. Service cannot be better, they treat every customers more than guests. Price is worthy for this service level and the view and vibe you get.",5,2018,11,04
145,Perfect stay.  Perfect location. ,"I have stayed at various hotels in London and this is probably one of the best in town.  Stayed here for three nights with hubby and it was just perfect.  

Too early to check in so they stored our luggage.  Came back late afternoon and was told bags were in our room already.  No they were not.  Not a problem. Got fixed right away. 

Breakfast was really good, plenty of options.  They did appear to have problems on fri am. Slightly chaotic.  

Charing Cross underground station and bus stops are all within a short walk, literally in yards.  

Great location and gotta try out the roof top bar.  Amazing view despite the cold.  ",4,2018,11,03
145,Super location,"Fantastic location overlooking Trafalgar Square. Small rooms but bigger than some city hotel rooms. Modern lounge area but pretty soulless.  Breakfast was good but nothing special, would probably book room only next time and eat breakfast out.  Would certainly stay again due to location.",4,2018,10,31
145,Central gem perfect for exploring London,I would strongly recommend this hotel. Nothing was too much trouble for any of the staff members. The location is perfect for exploring all of London's sites. Made for a perfect family trip. Great job. ,5,2018,10,30
145,Night our in London,"Great hotel close to west end and Soho, we were upgraded to a large room on the 1st floor which was very comfortable and the bed was one of the best we have slept on.Great Staff and breakfast with good quality food.",5,2018,10,29
145,"Wonderful hotel, great staff and excellent location.","The hotel was incredible. Clean, great design and the room layout was one of the best I have seen. The second vanity in the room was so helpful.  The two bars were wonderful, the rooftop view was magnificent and the lobby bar made great drinks!  The location was perfect. ",5,2018,10,29
145,Best small hotel I have ever experienced,"St. James Trafalgar Square - A small hotel with foyer, concierge, bar, dining room and front desk all in one cozy but well-presented and friendly space just inside the front door.  Manager and all staff professional and genuinely friendly.  Rooms have excellent decor.  Best bathroom design I have ever seen.  Breakfast set up around the bar starts the day perfectly.  So much within walking distance - National Portrait Gallery, Westminster Abbey, Thames Riverboats to name a few.  Memorable stay!",5,2018,10,28
145,Great hotel in a great location!!,"My husband and I decided tostados a couple extra days in London following a European tour. I had stayed here a few years ago and immediately booked our room. I’m so happy that I did. This hotel is in a perfect spot! Easy to get anywhere with using the tube, bus, taxi, etc. Rooms were very clean and accommodating. The continental breakfast was amazing. Easy check in and out. Staff and concierge were so helpful and friendly. Will definitely be back!!",5,2018,10,28
145,Nothing to fault it but not one we will go back to,"I don't know what to make of this Hotel.  We were told to wait when we checked in (after check in time) and no explanation was given as to why, just simply the Manager had left a note on the reservation.  Were not told we had to use our room keys to operate the life, just a poorly trained/briefed check in clerk, I hope. As it turned out nothing amiss, but did leave us wondering after a tiring day.  Room was excellent as is the location.  Breakfast serving slow even though buffet.",4,2018,10,28
145,One of best hotels I've stayed in!,"Me and my partner stayed here for one night for his birthday 24th October and can quite happily say it was the best hotel we've stayed at. From arrival to the moment we left staff were friendly and accommodating. 

We arrived early stored our bags no problem and checked in later that day we were given all the information we needed about our stay in such a good way. The room (King room) was lovely with great amenities everything we could need! 

I had contacted the staff previous to let them know it was my partners birthday after settling in the hotel had arranged a card, cake and Bottle of prosecco to enjoy! It just gave that extra special unexpected touch! we also had a drink on The Rooftop which I highly recommend, stunning views great service drinks and food!It was a little pricey but you get what you pay for!Also make sure you book in advance! 

The stay was wonderful rooms quiet considering you're in the heart of Trafalgar Square!

Breakfast was great too a lovely spread as well as an option from the al a carte menu for us which was lovely! Again great service and really friendly! 

When we checked out we left our bags and picked them up later that day. 

Overall really loved the hotel cant fault the service and would stay again!",5,2018,10,27
145,Great roof top bar for evening viewing!,"We didn't stay here however we did enjoy the roof top bar one clear evening to take in the London Eye, the Shard and the rest of London's spectacular treasures.  The wait staff is so friendly and fun making an evening cocktail hour so enjoyable.  They also provide blankets and heat lamps to make the experience even more pleasurable!",5,2018,10,24
145,"Trendy; good music, not bad snacks!!!","Enjoyed the haunt!!!  Nice rooftop, good music and good snacks. Service not bad at all. Just limited on coffee. Good views of London!!!

Would I return yes but earlier on in the day to enjoy more time and make the most of it!!!
",4,2018,10,22
145,Fantastic stay in wonderful location,"I generally don’t like to stay at chain hotels when in Europe, but the Trafalgar St James is part of the Curio collection, so feels like a luxury boutique hotel, not a big chain.  The rooms are large for London and so well appointed.  Really lovely touches like complimentary water and snacks in the room.  Right on Trafalgar Square, but the rooms are very quiet.  Great bar with fantastic bartenders who are so warm and upbeat and make incredible cocktails.  Staff is so friendly and helpful.  Carlos, one of the concierges, was a huge help in suggesting places nearby.  Excellent location right in the middle of London.  Can walk everywhere.  Highly recommend and will definitely stay again next time we are in London.",5,2018,10,21
145,In the middle of everything,"This hotel is located in the very heart of London, within walking distance of Westminster Abbey, Buckingham Palace, the Curchill War Rooms, and Big Ben. If you would rather walk short distances than taking the tube, this is an ideal choice. The rooftop dining is really more for drinking; if it's a dinner you seek, look elsewhere. The staff accomodated us with an early check in at 11:00 AM. Very comfortable beds and our room was quiet.",5,2018,10,21
145,"Excellent hotel, perfect location","Comfortable rooms,good beds.Try to book in advance the St James room with a view to Trafalgar Square. Never had breakfast there, it’s more like a coffee store with a menu or a bar for drinks.Great terrace for cocktails and small plates.Don’t forget reservations",4,2018,10,19
145,A Curate's Egg - Good in Parts!,"There is no doubting that the central location of this hotel in the West End makes it an ideal base for visiting London, and despite being on Trafalgar Square, the bedrooms are perfectly sound proofed. BUT BEWARE - when demonstrations are held, as they are all too often these days, and as Trafalgar Square is frequently the venue, then the surrounding streets are closed off, as they will be for Royal Occasions as well. This renders the hotel inaccessible to public and private transport alike, and could interfere with travel arrangements, reaching airports and stations etc. 
The rooms were comfortable and kept clean, with complementary tea, coffee and soft drinks. The rooms however were dark.There was no bath in our bathroom, so no lying down and relaxing after retail therapy or sight-seeing by foot.
The Concierge Desk could not have been more helpful, but not so the restaurant staff. Part of the problem here appeared to be too few waiting staff many of whom appeared inexperienced. After queuing for breakfast, it is annoying to be shown to a completely bare table and then wait nearly 10 minutes for tea and coffee. There is a good choice of hot dishes as well as the standard European buffet breakfast, but these must be ordered individually. The clientele in the restaurant seemed of a younger age group and the atmosphere buzzing and noisy. Good or bad? It depends on your point of view.
 I cannot in all conscience recommend it unreservedly.",3,2018,10,18
145,The most amazing stay I’ve ever had- luxury all the way!,"So to start this off , I’m a Hilton diamond member and I stay in many Hilton and non Hilton hotels often.  This hotel and it’s staff went above and beyond every single time I asked for anything.  From the front desk manager who upgraded me to a suite due to my room not being ready right at 3pm to the concierge who made sure to say hello and offer help every day and lastly the breakfast server who remembered my name and immediately sat me and my wife at breakfast each day.  This hotel is amazing , clean , location is absolutely amazing and the staff really want to ensure you enjoy your stay.  My suggestion is stay here, pay for the location and great treatment and you won’t be disappointed.  I also included a view of the square from the roof bar of the hotel in my review. ",5,2018,10,16
145,Top-Notch Service and Location!,"I planned our 10th Anniversary trip and narrowed it down to one of two hotels (the Trafalgar St. James - and the Sofitel down the street), ultimately choosing the St. James Trafalgar based on location and the fact that we are Hilton Honours members,  and I'm so glad I did!

We were greeted by Andromahi at front desk. She was very pleasant and we were lucky our room was available a tad early as we were exhausted from the long flight and wanted to freshen up before venturing out.  

Upon returning we had a note from the manager with a bottle of wine and some incredible dessert to celebrate our 10th Anniversary.  What a wonderful gesture and truly made our celebration that much more special!

We had the St. James Family King Room.  It was very spacious with plenty of extra room.  The Nespresso Coffee machine was excellent (admittedly I couldn't figure out how the pods dropped in at first, since my machine at home is different) - but it was delicious coffee for a great start (and end!) to the day.  The bar fridge was also complimentary, offering water, soft drinks as well, which we did use a few times.  We had a tub and shower with good water pressure.  There were robes, slippers, ironing board and hair dryer available to use as well.  There was also a separate seating area with a couch and a small table.  The room had a good sized safe, and enough drawers and closet space to unpack our clothes.  We didn't have the greatest view, but I didn't care much as we were barely in the room. 

Location was excellent.  I always felt safe day or night, it was steps to Trafalgar Square. Most of our day tours would have their starting points within a quick walking distance from the hotel which made it that much more convenient as well.  Subway was nearby - but we truly walked everywhere! (or cabbed it back when we were too tired!).  It was so easy to venture back to the hotel as it was in the middle of everything! 

Staff is incredible. They truly made us feel like we were part of the family. Ibby was always helpful, always greeting us with a huge smile.  Helping us when we had some concerns with our transfer back to the airport (as roads were closed for a marathon and we were worried about our car hire getting to us!).  You were always greeting with a smile from everyone, which was well received after an exhausting day of touring!   They even brought our uber eats up to our room for us one night as we were in our pyjamas already (and truthfully could barely move our legs after 8 hours of non-stop walking around the city)!  The uber driver would not be able to come up to our room, since you do need a room key to activate the elevator for security!  So we appreciate that the hotel staff brought our order up for us!

We didn't eat too often at the hotel as we weren't always hungry when we woke up with our time change and all.  There's a Pret-A-Manger next door as well as a café Nero if you're in a rush.  Although we did manage to eat our last day at the restaurant and we ordered a Traditional English Breakfast and it was truly delicious!

I'm so happy that we stayed here - everything was perfect!  Don't question it - just book!",5,2018,10,15
145,Excellent Place to Stay,A perfect spot in the city across from Trafalgar square.  The hotel has all the amenities you need for a pleasant stay.  The Admiralty across the street is a great place for lunch or a place to have a beer.,5,2018,10,08
145,Great Hotel in center of London,"Great Hotel, location, staff, amenities! Wonderful six days of vacation in heart of London. High quality hotel, wonderfully quiet rooms and truly excellent staff in all areas of this hotel. Excellent value and quality was consistent for our entire stay!",5,2018,10,07
145,Topnotch-in Everything,"My husband and I stayed here for 4 nights last month. This was the beginning of our trip to London and France, and to say that this stay was a great beginning would be an understatement. From the moment we arrived to the moment we left, we were well taken care of. Our room was very roomy with plenty of storage. The bathroom had a tub for two-it was huge- and a very nice shower. We felt very comfortable in the room, which is not something you can say about a lot of European hotel rooms. 

The breakfast buffet was included as my husband is a Hilton Diamond member. Yes, it was pricey, but it's London, and we would have paid for it, anyway, just because it was so good and there were so many options to choose from. We ended up eating breakfast, a very light snack, and then dinner for most of the days of our trip because breakfast was so filling (and good). 

The location is so central to many attractions. We walked to many of them or took the Tube- station is very close by. One day we had a special event occurring right by the hotel, the Tour of Britain, a cycling event which was awesome to watch from our window. 

We went to the Rooftop twice, once for dinner- we made a meal of about 7-8 small plates, and once for drinks and dessert. If you stay here, you must not pass up on the opportunity to have this experience. The view alone is worth the prices, and the food is really good. 

The service is outstanding. Case in point: the morning we were leaving, our driver who was going to take us to the airport was stuck in traffic (there's a lot of road construction near the hotel). The concierge talked to driver via my husband's cellphone, found out where he was, and then pulled my suitcase while we followed him to get to the car so we could finally be on our way to the airport. After we got in the car with the luggage, the driver then made a U-turn to get out of the traffic jam, and happily, we got to the airport in time for our flight. 

So, this hotel is just the about the best we have ever stayed at. I do have one caveat, though. When we were first shown to our room, I immediately noticed a ""fragrance."" I don't know why hotels and other establishments feel the need to smell like a spa, but any fragrance gives me a sinus headache and triggers an allergic reaction. We requested that the window be opened. We had to sign a release form for liability issues, and while the gentleman left to get the paperwork, I looked for the source of the fragrance. It was an oil diffuser with about 6 sticks in it which we immediately removed and set in the hallway. After the window was opened, and the air refreshed, I had no trouble at all. So, if you are going to stay here, and this is a problem for you, let them know about it beforehand.",5,2018,10,07
145,Great location - well fitted rooms - excellent staff,"Spent two nights here based on prior reviews, which were accurate. We stayed on the fifth floor of a six floor building (which appears to be the top floor for rooms). The check in experience was very good. Arriving on an early morning flight, the front desk checked us in and stored our bags. They promised to call when our room was ready and said they would put a rush on preparing it.

By a few minutes after noon, we received that call and were in! Thank you to the front desk staff, bell staff, and housekeeping for making it happen. Had a king room, a bit snug but efficient. Only one chair but for a longer stay, another place to sit other than the bed would be nice.  Comfortable bed and pillows. Very good walk-in shower - good water pressure and plenty of hot water. Air conditioning was needed on relatively warm London days and delivered a cool room quickly.

Used the concierge staff a few times and received good advice but the last day experienced really good recommendation and directions for a full service drug store and a local sandwich place for lunch. The concierge noticed the bell staff was occupied and pulled our bags from storage and summoned a London black taxi for our ride to a train station (not Charing Cross, which is nearby).

Location is outstanding - 10-12 minutes or less to walk to Westminster Abbey, Buckingham Palace, Horse Guards, 10 Downing Street, Churchill War Rooms, and Parliament. 

Rooftop restaurant and separate rooftop lounge are accessible from the sixth floor. We made reservations for the second night and they were needed as the lounge was packed. Had prosecco while viewing the city both in day light and transition to evening. Definitely make reservations and dress for a breeze. 

Other reviewers have mentioned slow or indifferent service in the restaurant and bar. Sadly, there is a noticeable gap between the front desk and concierge staff's attitude, speed of service, and overall interest in you as a customer and that of the bar and restaurant staff. But the continental breakfast was of good quality (though enjoy that first cup of coffee because you won't be asked if you would like a refill.) Because there are many options for meals and drinks including a pub only steps across a lane (no traffic, so no waiting) and the overall superior experience in the hotel, I didn't lower the rating.",5,2018,10,06
145,Honeymoon! ,"We sent to London on our honeymoon and we stayed at The Trafalgar st James hotel. Best choice ever. The staff was very nice  and helpful, the breakfast was fantastic. The room was clean and we even got a little present from the hotel 😊 The rooftop bar was nice to! ",5,2018,10,06
145,Beautiful hotel and rooftop,"Service was outstanding from start to finish (except it was a bit slow on the rooftop but they seemed understaffed).  Room was clean, modern, and importantly had plugs next to the bed.  Very central location.",5,2018,10,05

145,Great hotel with minor hiccups,"I had a great 5 night stay at this hotel last week. The rooms are spacious and well put up. Food is great. Some challenges that I faced were - unable to lower the room temperature  cos of which I would wake up soaking wet in sweat under the covers - the rooms get too hot!!!  Stinking smell from the washroom -  not sure why but for couple of nights the washroom was stinking of clogged drains - the smell went way on the 3rd day. Lastly -  room service is not accurate - I am a vegetarian and extra non -veg dishes turned up in my tray, staff forgot napkins  /cutlery etc.. may be there we too busy to notice! In any case, the food was great and I dont mind going back when I travel next.",4,2018,10,02
145,Perfect stay for West End Shows and shopping,"My wife and I stayed at this hotel from the 24'th to the 28'th of September. It proved to be in perfect distance to both West End shows and shopping. Breakfast was good, service outstanding, and rooms spacious, comfortable, and clean, If You go there, also pay a visit to the rooftop bar if the weather allows it. It gives You great oversight of the city

The room was beautiful, clean, very quiet, high quality furniture, bedding, accessories, free drinks in mini-fridge. I loved that I could choose my own room so I could select one with a separate tub. Staff was wonderful. In room dining tasty and convenient. WiFi flawless. Just a perfect place to stay. But, of course it is pricey.

145,"Superb hotel, great location, first rate service...","My wife and I stayed here for one night for our wedding anniversary as we had theatre and dinner booked in soho, it was a great location for us with a short walk to soho as well as Waterloo station for our trains to and from home. 
The service was absolutely first rate, from arriving early to drop our bags off so we could go to our afternoon show, but actually being offered and early checkin, to all the other staff who served us food and drinks during our stay, excellent!
The room was great, very clean and with all the amenities you’d need, including a free mini bar (just soft drinks) which also contained proper milk for our tea!
Before our show we decided to stay and have a drink at the hotels rooftop bar which was definitely worth it for the amazing views. An awesome place for a pre-theatre drink. 
We didn’t eat dinner at the hotel as we had booked elsewhere, but if the superb breakfast is anything to go by the food is also top notch. 
Would highly recommend a stay and will definitely return...",5,2018,09,22
145,Exceptional end to anniversary trip!,"We ended our anniversary trip here after a two week cruise before we flew home. They went above and beyond to make the evening a special occasion.

145," Good location but....","We stayed 3 nights after a cruise, we are medium age professional women . We love to travel!! We love 5 stars hotel 
The location is excellent close to every where..
But the lobby is small for my taste .
The breakfast need  more person working there !!were only 3 persons for a big room , we seat and nobody came for almost 20Minutes to offers coffee, nobody is looking after you.the breakfast is ok but there are plenty on places close to the hotel to have breakfast.
No turn down in the evening, for 5 star hotel when you paid almost 400 per night i!!
The terrace is gorgeous but for me
Overrating. The terrace is the face of the hotel but you need to do reservation no matters you are staying in the hotel . To go there is
 more complicate to enter Buckingham palace!! They need to work with that.. 
The room  was modern and confortable with a big bathroom.
Concierge area were helpful!!",3,2018,09,18

145,Outstanding Hotel in a great location ,"Could not have stayed at a better hotel for our 5 night visit to London.  Central location to shopping, dining and sight seeing.  

Stayed in a Trafalgar King jr suite room which was roomy and bright with a big bathroom with huge tub and separate shower.  The room was impeccably clean and well designed and decorated.  Very trendy but classy too. 

The staff was amazing. We travel often and this hotel Team was top notch.  From the front desk, to housekeeping, concierge and the restaurant staff, all were knowledgeable and super friendly.  It shows that they are very well trained and proud of their hotel

The rooftop bar and restaurant is great. Nice city views and food was very good.  Small plates great for sharing.  The lobby bar and restaurant were very good too. Attentive staff and a nice menu for breakfast

They have a small gym but it fit the bill with four cardio machines and weights.  

Thank you to all for being our home away from home!  We will be back for sure. ",5,2018,09,17
145,Walk easily to most everything.,The location was in a very busy area but this made it possible to walk easily to most major attractions in all surrounding areas.  Transportation was also very close if needed. Trafalgar Square was enjoyable at all times of the day. ,5,2018,09,16
145,Great Location and very friendly Staff,The hotel is located in a perfect location for all tourist things in London. It has a contemporary feel with plenty with great amenities early risers and late-nighters.  The bar at the top is must do as the view is amazing especially at night.  The underground is a 2 minute walk right outside of the hotel so you are really connected to everything.,5,2018,09,15

They treated us to a nice upgrade (Both DIA's) and the staff couldn't have been nicer, and we enjoyed the complimentary (for DIA's) morning breakfast.  Top to bottom from Roof Top bar to the staff, the room etc this property is EXCELLENT.  Additionally, well I LOVE THE LOCATION.  This is my go to area when visiting London and St. James Curio at Trafalgar is a great choice.",5,2018,09,12
145,Loved this little hotel - Perfect Location,"We just visited London for a long weekend and stayed at the Trafalgar on Hilton points.  The staff was great and the location was perfect.  Room was a bit small but hey, we were there on points.

Ibby, the Concierge, really took great care of us.  Good recommendations, took care of our transportation needs etc.  Even came in early one day to try make sure we got the car we needed.

Try the roof top bar for a cocktail with a view!",4,2018,09,08
145,Great Choice,Great stay. We travel to London for business quite often. This will definitely be our choice hotel going forward. The guest rooms were very well appointed and comfortable. The staff was extremely helpful and professional. ,5,2018,09,06
145,Excellent hotel - service and location are first rate!,"I have stayed at the Trafalgar St. James three times this year, coming back because of the hotel, the location and the service.

145,A hidden perfection gem ,"OMG....what can I say....this is a boutique hotel with 7 star service. Every person you meet wants to make things perfect.....and they do. I have never had such individual service and such perfection in any hotel.

Seriously, if you are in London and want central location.....outstanding service.......true relaxation.....then book here....it is out of this world ",5,2018,09,06
145,Great choice ...,"If you want to see London, this hotel is literally in the centre of it all. All staff members were very nice & professional. The breakfast was delicious with huge variety of food to choose from. Drinks on the roof terrace with the view of the whole  downtown is definitely worth making the reservation. Hope to back soon!",5,2018,09,05
145,"Lovely hotel, very central for sight seeing","Surprised at how quiet this hotel is considering what a fab location it is. The reception service impeccable. Rooms extremely clean and comfortable. No bath (shame as the rooms are not cheap), shower very large and powerful so lovely but do like a hotel bath. Bed large, pillows comfortable. Decor very nice. Molton Brown products. Aircon not overly powerful. Solid building and rooms quiet. 
Drinks list in main bar extensive and all delicious. Roof top bar fantastic views but not as good a drinks menu as main hotel bar. 
Breakfast ok. 
All in all a great, comfortable stay. Location very central on foot to most sights. ",4,2018,09,04
145,Fantastic Location. Near perfect 8-Night Stay. ,"I honestly didn’t know what to expect when we got here but I was pleasantly surprised about this hotel. The location is fantastic. Literally a couple of steps to Trafalgar Square, Buckingham Palace, Westminster Abbey. It’s also near Piccadilly Circus in The West End where you can catch all the plays you want plus do some shopping at Leicester Square and what’s even more convenient is there’s both a tube stop and a bus stop right outside the hotel. You can even take the Hop on Hop Off Tour bus right outside too. If you prefer Taxi or Uber, both are readily available as well. 

In terms of amenities and service, I can say that the hotel is top notch. I’d say it’s a five star boutique hotel with a wonderful rooftop bar. I love the room, simple but elegant and the bed was awesome. Room service offerings are pretty limited, although from what we tried they were pretty good besides because of its location, it’s so easy to just step out  and grab a bite outside. Staff from the front desk to the concierge to the bellman are very helpful and try to help you as much as they can. 

If there’s one hiccup to our stay, I’d probably say the Housekeeping Department needs some improvement in terms of room cleanliness including arrangement of things in the room and servicing the needs of the room like refilling the amenities in the bathroom. May I suggest that they also just inform their guests that perhaps it’s better to inform the front desk or concierge as your about to step out of the hotel that you want your room cleaned instead of just leaving the sign of “make me fresh” again. We had a problem that our room wasn’t cleaned even if we stepped out for a couple of hours and perhaps there’s a better way of communicating regrets for what happened and admitting of such shortcoming would be good thing for the team to learn in this instance to prevent any tension with the guest and the team. Pinning the blame on the guest or making the guest feel this way is not a very good way to deal with it. 

Nonetheless, It was still a near perfect 8 night stay in this hotel. I mean no one is perfect so even with the housekeeping fiasco and the way it was initially handled at the front desk when we called to raise our concern on the uncleaned room, I’d still give this property 5 stars and I just hope they will take my constructive criticism seriously to prevent it from happening again. I wouldn’t hesitate to stay here again next time I visit London. ",5,2018,09,04
145,Fantastic Location,"We stayed at this hotel for three nights.  We had booked online via Expedia a King Room (St James) based on the descriptions they provided of the rooms.  The staff who greeted us when we arrived and assisted us with our luggage were very welcoming, helpful and friendly, as were the staff at reception.  When we arrived just prior to 12.00 pm we were very fortunate to find they had a room of the category we had booked already available.

The room to which they escorted us (with our luggage) was lovely (number 406) but contrary to the description provided for this room on the Expedia website, it did not have a deep soaking bathtub but rather only a walk-in shower.  After we had checked in and found that the room had no bathtub, I reviewed the information Hilton provide on their own website about this room, and they state that the room category has a walk-in shower.

Given that we specifically booked that room to ensure the availability of a bathtub, we made a call to reception and chose to pay to upgrade our room category to a Family Room (St James) in order to access the facilities we were seeking.  A room of this category was not available at the time, but we were told if we would like to go out, we could leave our luggage in the original room and it would be moved for us upon a room becoming ready.  Our new room (419) was also a lovely, clean and spacious room and as advised, our luggage had already all been transferred over to it for us when we returned later that afternoon.

As far as the location of this hotel, we found it to be exceptionally convenient to major attractions, eg the National Gallery, the National Portrait Gallery and Trafalgar Square as well as very close to the Charing Cross tube station.  In addition, it was within easy walking distance of St James’s Park and Horse Guards and is also close to many London theatres.

We had a continental buffet breakfast in the restaurant on one morning, but decided that we would prefer to avail ourselves of other facilities in the area for breakfast on the other mornings.  Although there is a reasonable range of foods available, we felt that it was probably better value to dine elsewhere.

All in all though, because it was so centrally located and the room was modern and clean with air conditioning and access via elevators, we would be happy to stay at the hotel again in the future.",4,2018,09,03
145,Awesome location,Great property with amazing location .The rooms are large and clean . Really nice rooftop bar.Staff are great .We had issues with a/c and they were very responsive and got us a fan to help.  The rooftop bar is really very good.,5,2018,09,03
145,Fantastic experience - above & beyond expectations,I chose this hotel due to its fantastic location and great reviews. I was not disappointed whatsoever. I asked my girlfriend of 4 years to marry me in London during this trip and the entire hotel staff went above and beyond in making the event both special and memorable. I would highly recommend the Trafalgar St. James to anyone traveling to London and especially to anyone planning a big event! It will not disappoint!,5,2018,09,02
145,Brilliant Curio St James Trafalgar Spot On Spot !,"We stayed at this lovely hotel 5 nights for part of our family UK vacation.  The location could not be more ideal for sightseeing, and walking about London.  We were a bit nervous that the location might be too noisy or unpleasant, but that was not the case at all.  We had a 4th floor ""Family"" room with 2 queen size beds and found the space more than adequate and the noise level remarkably low for a street facing room.  The bathroom was generous for city hotel room, and all the spaces have been recently refurbished.  The decor is nicely done, rich materials and thoughtful palette.  Not sure I get some aspects of the decor, specifically the rock and movie star photos, but our kids seemed to like them.  Service was ""spot on"" , manager and front desk all super polite, pleasant and accommodating.   Rooftop lounge was fun, morning breakfast convenient and welcome benefit of Hilton Honors program.  We loved our stay, would recommend and stay here again.",4,2018,09,02
145,Excellent central location ,"Very nice and central hotel in London close to everything. Marketed as 5-star, I think 4 would be more appropriate. The overall appearance is beautiful, the rooms are clean and modern, but the hallway could be more refreshed, the room service more prompt. And while the equipment in the gym is modern, it is quite limited. There is a nice entry level restaurant (which offers a wonderful breakfast buffet) as well as the roof top bar with gorgeous view of the city. Best unquestionably is the location right at Trafalgar square, easily reachable with Heathrow Express to Paddington and the Bakerloo line to Charring Cross.",4,2018,09,01
145,"Location, location, location.","Clean, quiet, friendly service and very centrally located. It’s pricey but worth the splurge for a couple nights to be central to everything, including all the theatres. Very short walk to Piccadilly Circus, Soho and Leicester square - found an even quicker short cut on our last day (small narrowing between the two gallery buildings by the colourful 4 ft rhino replica).  Minutes from the Thames and Charring Cross tube is 30 seconds away.

I do not recommend buying any umbrellas from street vendors. If there is any wind at all, they will bend and eventually break very shortly after purchase. Pack you own, when travelling to London.",5,2018,09,01
145,Walking distance to the shopping & theatre districts. ,"This is the third time I stay at this hotel this year. It has a central location. Spacious rooms. Comfortable beds.

They have a 5/5 rooftop bar which has spectacular views of the city,  reserve before you go! ",4,2018,08,29

The room was fresh and comfortable, bathroom great, and the view of Trafalgar Square from our specially selected view room was superb.",5,2018,08,26
145,Luxe hotel in unbeatable location,"I stayed at The Trafalgar as a group of one adult and two school age children.  We chose this hotel because of its central location right across the street from Trafalgar Square, as well as its ready access to both public buses and the Tube.  Overall, we found The Trafalgar to be a fabulous hotel in a central location that served as a great home base for our four day tour of London.

The location of the hotel is simply fabulous.  It’s walkable to many of the big tourist spots like Buckingham Palace and Piccadilly Circle, even with a seven year old child.  What’s not readily walkable is accessible by buses that leave from right in front of the hotel, or different subway options that are nearby.  We simply will not have been able to see as much of London if we were not in such a central location, especially if you have an Oyster transport card.  There’s just so much within walking distance, and so much more on public transportation.

We stayed in the Trafalgar Suite.  This is a room with a king bed and a sofa bed that occupies a little raised area of the room.  The room feels bright and spacious for a family.  The bathroom is also very nice with a separate shower stall and a great big bathtub.  There’s also ample storage for three people and two weeks worth of luggage.  The room would be fine for a family of four.  The hotel and the room overall has been recently renovated and feels very modern and very clean.

The complimentary breakfast for Hilton Gold members was a simple, ordinary, but tasty continental breakfast … bread, fruit, cold cuts, cheese, cereal.  We did not otherwise dine in the hotel, or take advantage of the famous rooftop bar.

I highly recommend The Trafalgar as a great family tourist hotel.  It’s newly refurbished, luxurious, and so central to everything.  I’d definitely stay here again next time I am in London.",5,2018,08,26
145,Anniversary Stay,"Visited to celebrate a 5th wedding anniversary. Very attentive and welcoming staff, fantastic atmosphere and decor with the lighting absolutely perfect in both the room, bar and communal areas.

With its location being a huge plus point",5,2018,08,25
145,Great Small Hotel in Prime Location,"This was our second stay at the Hilton at Trafalgar Square. It was very nice our last visit. But we were amazed at the improvements throughout the hotel. Everything-the rooms, the bar/dining room and the Rooftop Bar are top notch. The staff couldn’t be friendlier or more helpful. A big plus regarding this hotel is it’s prime location. It’s perfect for walking around London. We highly recommend this hotel.",5,2018,08,23
145,"Great hotel, great location ","We had a short break and used this as Hilton members. Great hotel with excellent rooms containing nice touches like a nespresso machine. Breakfast had a good choice. Really good service throughout the experience. 
The rooftop bar was also very pleasant!
Location was ideal.

145,Great Views,We enjoyed a few drinks here with our relatives from the USA. The view is great but the drinks are pricey -  only to be expected from such a great  venue in such a location. Worth a visit for a special occasion.Service is good - as expected. Thank you.,4,2018,08,20
145,Great hotel,"Great hotel, rooms are big and spacious, bed and pillows are comfortable and shower and toiletries are really nice.
Food in the restaurant is not a massive choice, burger with the rarebit was very tasty, we had desert which was lovely but very tiny! 
Rooftop bar is a real treat, nice cocktail menu and the view is amazing looking over the Trafalgar Square, you can see so much from up there. 
Breakfast was good we could eat anything from the buffet then order just one choice from the hot a la Carte menu, nice touch. 
All in all it was a great stay and would definitely return, everywhere is close buy and easy to get to.",5,2018,08,20
145,Beautiful hotel,"This hotel is prime for the location, decor, breakfast and rooftop bar. The concierge service was also very helpful. We ran into a few challenges our last night which included party noise late at night coming from the rooftop bar and the headboard falling while we were trying to go to sleep. Both were resolved by the night time manager who was very apologetic and helped to resolve them. We also had a few challenges with the daytime desk staff which seemed to be due to inexperienced staff, but were able to overlook all of this by the above benefits. I would recommend staying here and request to speak with management if you have any challenges.",4,2018,08,19
145,I would recommend this hotel to my friends and family,Excellent Hotel. Great location. Very helpful and professional staff. Breakfast was very good. Non alcoholic mini bar was complementary. The complementary coffee and tea was very good. Loved everything about the hotel and my stay.,5,2018,08,17
145,Very nice contemporary hotel ,"My husband and I stayed at this amazing hotel for two nights, beautiful hotel, very new contemporary feel just what we like. The staff were very friendly and so helpful nothing was too much trouble, as Hilton honors members we got upgraded to a very nice room. The hotel was very clean, the mini bar was complimentary With soft drinks and fresh milk.  iPad in the room to browse, everything in the hotel was very well presented  of for a real nice comfortable stay. Breakfast was very good quality.I was-really impressed and will be back next time we stay in London.  ",4,2018,08,16
145,Excellent Stay in the Middle of Tourist Central,"You would be forgiven for thinking this hotel is purely about its location - opposite Trafalgar Square, 5 mins from Piccadilly Circus, walking distance to Westminster, Covent Garden, Soho, the West End, Regent/Oxford Street - and whilst its location is undeniably excellent, it is also a bloody good hotel to boot. Professional and personable staff, tasteful decor throughout, fantastic rooms and facilities - this place certainly has a lot going for it. We stayed for 3 nights in a Trafalgar King room. The size was more than adequate, bed very comfy with nice linen. Good Wi-fi throughout. Good shower pressure. Decor was nice with some cool, kinda retro twists - especially the monochrome tiled bathroom with vintage style fittings. The cool, retro vibe is carried through into the rest of the hotel too, from the corridors to the all day dining restaurant TDR, with pictures of Jagger, Bowie et al adorning the walls. Its a very attractive hotel for sure. We dined at TDR twice for breakfast. Both times the food was excellent, however the second time the service seemed a little disorganized and haphazard but certainly not a deal-breaker. One the reasons for booking this hotel was for The Rooftop, its al fresco roof bar and restaurant offering prime viewing over Trafalgar Square and beyond. Its obviously a very busy spot, with the best seats taken up early of course and a few spats breaking out over the few remaining prime seats. We were sat in the main part of the bar itself, which on another night would have been open air due to its retractable roof, but as it was raining it was fully covered - a bit of a shame but not to be helped. The food was mix of Korean & Japanese served on small plates served as they come from the kitchen. We basically ordered everything on the menu with the Korean food being better executed than the Japanese in my opinion. It would have been better too if the kitchen had slowed down the pace as it was a struggle to get all the dishes on the table, so closely together did they arrive, meaning we kind of had to race to eat the food rather than take our time. Nevertheless, it was enjoyable if not spectacular eating. We did not get chance to see the gym. Staff were great throughout, whether checking in or out, the wait staff, concierge etc. Check out time of 12pm is good. Very much enjoyed our stayed at The Trafalgar St James and will strongly consider a repeat booking next time i'm back in London",5,2018,08,16
145,Absolutely Incredible!,"We stayed at The Trafalgar for one night while in town for our Honeymoon and wish that we could have stayed longer. There is so much that could be said about this wonderful Hotel, but it is incredible all around! The accommodations, employees, amenities, etc. were all just lovely. I could go on and on. Our entire experience while staying at The Trafalgar was top notch and we have recommended this Hotel to all of our friends. This was our first trip to London and we fell in love with the city. The location of this Hotel is perfect and easily accessible to so many of the highlights and history sprinkled throughout London. Also - can we talk about their roof top restaurant & bar?! I could have stayed up there all night. It was a bit breezy and they provided everyone with a blanket that I considered shoving into my purse, but refrained. I just love everything about this Hotel and literally cannot wait to return. Thank you for a truly incredible experience!",5,2018,08,15
145,Wow,"Wow, what an amazing hotel and staff. Everything you could possibly want to see is in walking distance and the Charring Crossing tube is across the street. Great value for proximity, stylish decor and a bed so comfortable that I never wanted to leave. 5 Stars here",5,2018,08,14
145,Top notch hotel,"We stayed here for one night as it was close to where we were going on London and it has been one of my favourite hotels to stay in! The room was luxurious and everything was perfect. The staff were great and very friendly and helpful. The breakfast was amazing, great coffee and the pancakes were delicious! It’s a great location if you are in central London as a base to see the sights or just have a wander. ",5,2018,08,14
145,Lovely Hotel,"In London to meet up with friends and stayed overnight at The Trafalgar on Saturday 11th August. A return visit to the hotel since the refurbishment. The location is, of course, wonderful but the hotel now looks fabulous. Our St. James room  was extremely well appointed, spotless, and looked directly onto Trafalgar Square. Impossible to find any fault whatsoever. I mentioned the location, and the views from Rooftop Bar in particular, (where I enjoyed some lovely Manhattan cocktails) are spectacular.

The Hotel's crowning glory however, has to be the quality and friendliness of the staff. Everyone we came into contact with was polite, friendly, and helpful. Upon arrival we were invited over to the reception as soon as we walked in the door. No waiting, just friendly and efficient service. Reception, bar staff, everyone went out of their way to make you feel welcome, taking time to stop and chat. Impressive indeed.

The Trafalgar certainly becomes a hotel of choice in London, and I certainly hope to pay a return visit in the very near future.

145,"Perfect Location, great service","Stayed here with my husband for three days in July. We loved the Trafalgar Square location. Close to the Waterloo underground stop, beautiful St. James Park, the National Gallery and right across the street from a fantastic pub, The Admiralty. Enjoyed breakfast each morning in their cafe and a drink each night in the pretty bar. Friendly and helpful staff.",5,2018,08,12
145,New and modern in a great location.,"Everything looks new and modern with obvious upgrades in the details such as upgraded carpeting making it very plush throughout the hotel, high end duvets and pillows and a staff trained for customer service. Beautiful, detailed lobby and restaurant. Well done.

Other bonuses - free mini bar snacks and beverages that get refilled every day. Lots of storage drawers and cabinets. Location within a short walking distance to Leicester Square, China Town, Piccadilly Circus, Covent Garden, Carnaby, Oxford, Big Ben, Westminster. And surprisingly, very quiet considering this hotel is literally within Trafalgar Square.

Only regret is that I wish we had time to check out the rooftop patio. Next time for sure since I would return to this hotel.",5,2018,08,12
145,"Great location, not-so-great breakfast","I'll start off by saying that my rating is based on the difference between the level of service I expect for a luxury hotel and the offering from this property.  If this was a mid-range hotel, I may have offered four stars, but this is a luxury hotel, and the experience should be flawless.

I stayed at the Trafalgar St. James from 4-6 August 2018 as the last stop on a family vacation.  The hotel is central to all activities in London.  This was our second stop in London during this vacation, so I can compare it to another Hilton property - the Hilton Tower Bridge which is not as centrally located, but provides better value.  The Trafalgar St. James is immediately adjacent to the Charing Cross underground stop, so it's convenient for everything.  The decoration is modern and sophisticated.  I think this is expected for the price for this hotel and for any hotel that advertises itself as a boutique hotel.

We had a St. James family king room for 2 adults and one child (12) which was comfortable and well appointed (best shower I have had in the UK).  The view was across Cockspur Street to Canada House (so nothing exceptional) - I think if you were closer to Trafalgar Square than we were on the same side of the building, you could probably see Lord Nelson's statue.  The booking I made had breakfast included in the room rate.  I was extremely disappointed with breakfast at this hotel.  The breakfast bar is cold.  All Hilton hotels I have been to have offered hot breakfast bar offerings (this includes the Hilton Tower Bridge that I stayed at the week before).  In addition, on our last day at the hotel, we had breakfast a la carte (also included in the room rate).  The waiter took my order, but only returned with my wife's order when the food was delivered to the table.  I asked about my order and he didn't seem to remember it.  He went back and checked and said it would be out in a few minutes.  He returned later - with a second portion of my wife's order (an omelete - I ordered the English breakfast).  I explained that this was not what I ordered and reiterated my order - the English breakfast with scrambled eggs.  He went back and checked and came back to the table and said it would be out shortly and that he was sorry because the ordering system indicated that the English breakfast had been made and delivered, but that the omelet was not delivered - that is why he delivered the omelet the second time.  After waiting several more minutes, my breakfast was delivered, an English breakfast with fried eggs.  The waiter said he couldn't remember what type of eggs I ordered so he brought out poached eggs too (I had ordered scrambled).

My room rate was >450 GBP per night.  I booked from the Hilton web-site, and I am a Hilton Honors member.  I expect better service than I received, and because of my breakfast experience, I left feeling like the hotel really isn't trying to maximize the experience of their guests.",3,2018,08,11
145,Brilliant hotel,"Stayed three nights fantastic hotel great location lovely king bed room already booked for next year would highly recommend staff very friendly ,very close to the tube station right next to Trafalgar Square and the National gallery ",5,2018,08,07
145,A true gem! Amazing view,"Lovely view and amazing location- super convenient for after work drinks or a stop over after sightseeing. You can take smashing photos with London Eye and London Skyline. 

I recommend to book in advance as gets busy -  but even on the day a few hours before the visit you can still snap a good table!",5,2018,08,07
145,Nice room with a wretched view,"The rooms here are quiet, especially considering the busy location.  Location is great, lots of restaurants nearby, theatre, museums etc. My short stay here was marred by the view.  I'm ok with a soulless triangle of delivery trucks and dumpster, but the desiccated dead pigeon has a way of making a room service breakfast particularly unappetizing.  Front desk seems overworked and hassled by too many clueless tourists which makes this less of a business trip oriented place.  Was unable to take advantage of the breakfast since it isn't ready until 7A.",3,2018,08,06
145,Centrally Located,"Love the hotel as it is centrally located in London. There’s so much congestion and the weather was hot but it didnt stop us with our adventure in London. St. James Trafalgar hotel was our ideal resting place after all the busy schedule we had. We had complimentary breakfast which was so great and delicious. We just didnt have a great experience at The Rooftop restaurant. They were’nt as nice as the staff in lobby restaurant. But overall, we had an awesome experience!",4,2018,08,06
145,Beautiful hotel in a great location,"This hotel is certainly up there in the 5* rating. I’ve stayed in many hotels in London and I would say this is by far, the cleanest. I found it difficult it find any dust or dirt. 

I booked the Barry Suite on the 1st floor. Amazing room, lovely decor, clean and very spacious. I checked-in the night before using the Hilton App and on the day I was able to use a virtual key on my smartphone giving me access to my room including the lifts.  

I was welcomed by a very helpful receptionist who answered all my questions. The reception area was small but spacious and on the same floor opposite, a bar serving alcohol drinks and bar food with very comfy seats. 

On arrival at my room using the digital key it worked perfectly with no technical problems or complexity and very easy to use.

On entering the Barry Suite I was amazed and very impressed with the room decor and cleanliness. The room had high grand windows with wooden flooring and a nice comfy sofa facing the TV. The queen size bed was centred in the middle with an ottoman seat in front. Near the window area were nice upholstered chairs with a small dining table. The bathroom bas a good size bath with a built in TV on the wall and a separate  shower and toilet. 

The room was sound proof with no noise from outside or from the adjoining rooms. Facing a very busy road I couldn’t hear any noise during the night. The bed was so comfortable I didn’t want to leave and the pillows were also very comfortable. 

The complementary bar was filled with cold soft drinks and water. There was a coffee machine with a selection of coffees and fresh milk in the fridge. Also a drinks trolley with brandy and whisky in canisters, I’m not sure whether this was complementary but the option was there if you’re a drinker. 

On returning to the room I noticed the drinks bar was refilled and glasses cleaned. 

I had the continental breakfast in the morning which cost half the price if booked the day before at reception and the selection was basic but you have the option to order from their menu and all at reasonable prices.

My overall experience was delightful and enjoyable and I will certainly be going back. I highly recommend this hotel and the service from staff was exceptional. The staff say hello and make you feel welcome even when walking down the corridor. 

Thank you for making my stay pleasant.

145,Cool and calm Oasis right on the square,"Fabulous room, lovely staff, perfect location for exploring London.  After a day in the bustle of the city, this hotel is a wonderful tranquil place to retreat to.  Superb breakfast too.  I’m a Hilton Diamond member and stay in a fair number of them.  This is without doubt my favourite Hilton in London.",5,2018,08,03
145,Honeymoon stay,"We loved the proximity to everything, the concierge is fantastic as are the staff in the bar! My only slight complaint is that I had to keep asking for a top sheet! Small thing im sure however it makes my stay. Also, the roof top bar is gorgeous but tapas. Dont go if your starving! Cocktails would be good!",4,2018,08,02
145,Rooftop bar review,"I was really disappointed with the refurbished layout of the rooftop bar (which was my favourite in London.)  We were sat at the back and with all the walls up on the side - l could have been anywhere as the view was so blocked.  Just a real shame.

However, amazing playlist!  @ The Rooftop St. James, is it on Spotify so l could access it?",4,2018,08,02
145,Good location ,"A very nicely located hotel. Good service, friendly staffs. Very easily accessed by tube. It’s located right next to Trafalgar Square and the Wall. Very busy location but room is quiet. But better go by tube because the traffic is so congested near the Wall. ",4,2018,07,31
145,Lovely boutique hotel,"I stayed here on the second portion of my London trip as i wanted to be closer to the city.
I went from a massive room at my previous hotel to something more cozy, so i took time to adjust to that. 
The rooms were practically brand new, again, very clean and comfortable. 

They provide a free minibar which is replenished daily, and great products in the bathroom. 

The room was a little cozy, i was in the last room in the corner, however the boutique feel and stylish vibe made up for the tighter space. 

The rooftop bar was beautiful and had fantastic drinks available for purchase with a great view. 

The hotel itself is a little pricey for what you get, however, i'm still glad i stayed here and experienced it. ",4,2018,07,31
145,A London Experience,"We have stayed at the Trafalgar-St. James before and that is why we selected it for this trip. However, it exceeded expectations: many updated modifications; tremendous staff;great room; bed was excellent; breakfast selections super. The day we departed, the roads around the hotel were closed due to a huge bicycle event The staff facilitated our departure such that we had no difficulties getting to the airport. Outstanding service!",5,2018,07,30
145,"Great Location, Gorgeous Hip Hotel, Poor Service","I was in London recently for a couple of nights and chose this hotel for the location - it's an incredibly walkable area and close to the West End, where I was seeing a show. First of all, you cannot beat the location. Right on Trafalgar Square, walking distance to almost everything and close to a couple of tube stations. The front desk and concierge staff were amazing; although ALL major roads around the city were closed during the weekend I was there for a bike race (which I did not know about in advance), they were very accommodating, including walking me to a taxi several blocks away to catch a flight at Heathrow. The hotel is gorgeous with a hip, modern vibe and my room was comfortable, although I looked out on an inner courtyard with office buildings across the way. On the less positive side, aside from the front desk/concierge the service in the restaurants was pretty lackadaisical, to put it nicely. I had made a reservation at the Rooftop bar months in advance when I booked the hotel. I was visiting my son who is at Oxford and thought this would be a cool thing to do. Although we had a reservation, we were shown to a table in the back - a large room that felt like a frat party with large tables of what seemed like bachelorette and office parties. We were put in a corner and no one waited on us for 20 minutes. Long story short we complained and after a while ended up with a perfect seat at the ledge in the rooftop area. Service was still slow but we had a nice time and the drinks were great. I just wondered, why would someone make a reservation and then be seated in the back room? The whole point of going up there is the view. The next night we tried to have a light meal in the restaurant. Again we were seated and waited 20 minutes for anyone to wait on us - I mean we didn't even get water or drinks orders, or anyone approaching our table for 20 minutes, when there was plenty of staff around. I felt like perhaps this hotel caters to a younger crowd and I wasn't part of that demographic and therefore a less-desirable customer, or the restaurant staff simply doesn't care about customer service. For me service is a huge part of what gives a hotel an excellent rating and if the TSJ could raise the bar for its restaurant staff it would go a long way to making it a 5-star hotel in my book. Overall, however, I loved this hotel and would give it another try.",4,2018,07,30
145,Sample the high life,"A lovely location to sip a gin and tonic and try a range of delicious light meals. Staff are efficient, the prices reasonable for the location.The views can be stunning, minewas of a crane!! Ask for a seatwith a view",5,2018,07,29
145,Wonderful Hotel,"I had a great time staying at this hotel. Room was very clean and was cleaned to perfection everyday. Breakfast was excellant with a wide variety of food, which wasw worth the price. Front desk personnel was outgoing and very kind and helpful.",4,2018,07,29
145,Amazing stay,This hotel is a classy hotel located in the heart of Trafalgar Square. Do not hesitate booking the reservation here is by far the best hotel I've been at and I travel the world. The staff went out of their way to be helpful they would look after your needs book any tours I would constantly ask if everything was okay. They made you feel like you are part of their family,5,2018,07,28
145,"Nice hotel, poor service ","I have stayed at this hotel regularly over the last 20 years , it is in a great location, looking out onto Trafalgar Square. It was refurbished and rebranded as a “Hilton Curio” and really is a great hotel in an ideal location for Theatre land . I found the staff lacking in experience and breakfast was particularly disappointing. On both days I stayed, nobody wanted them take my order and when I went to ask , my cooked breakfast took over 25 minutes and I had to remind staff twice ! This is not the usual Hilton standard I expect from a yo of the range hotel . ",3,2018,07,27
145,Classic luxury in a great location,"This hotel is very well situated at the corner of Trafalgar Square. The checking desk is a bit hidden away in a back corner behind the restaurant, if you enter from Cockspur St, but trust me it's in there. The rooms have an opulent feel with modern amenities: your own personal nespresso machine and tablet! There is also a lovely, very small, roof top bar. Concierge service was excellent but I would advise avoiding the restaurant on street level. Breakfast buffet was serviceable if you don't take into account the not easily accessible bar counter but the a la carte menu was a total disappointment. With these prices you would expect some basic culinary skills and use of spices but sadly all flavour was absent. Luckily there are other shops and restaurant in the immediate vicinity. I do recommend the hotel, however.",4,2018,07,26
145,Small luxury in the heart of London. Perfect for family stopover!,"Lovely boutique hotel just off Trafalgar Square.  So convenient for anyone doing a quick tourist stopover in London as we were.  ""Original"" Hop on/Hop off bus is literally outside the hotel. 

I must say it was very easy to contact hotel and book connecting rooms for my family.  Extremely helpful staff both in in-house reservations prior and at the hotel itself.  Equally convenient to call and upgrade HHonors points room to a larger room (Double-double connecting to king) due to additional family member on our trip.  Rooms connect very nicely (via a hidden door in the back of the rooms).  Spacious, well appointed rooms especially for London, including couch/chairs. Stylish bathrooms!  Everyone slept like a baby.  Nice continental breakfast included & inexpensive additional options.  Diamond benefits included 1-level room upgrade (pre-confirmed) and breakfast.  Best of all was hotel remembered we were on a trip for my wife's birthday and left us a handwritten note and something sweet.  It is the little things that count!",5,2018,07,22
145,"Great location, great hotel, great staff!","Really enjoyed staying at this hotel. It was pricey for sure, but I guess it was worth it in the end. Nice sized king room, very clean, good housekeeping, excellent soundproofing (hardly heard anything from outside). Location is hard to beat if you're a tourist. Rooftop was very nice too.",5,2018,07,21
145,"Poor housekeeping, excessive noise, terrible view","I did extensive research prior to booking this hotel and was extremely surprised and disappointed with our stay. I booked the hotel months in advance and was called the day of our arrival and informed they’d oversold the type of room I booked. The hotel did offer a solution and, instead of one large double room, we were offered two small adjoining rooms. This seemed like an acceptable solution and we accepted the change. What we weren’t told was that our rooms would be directly under the Rooftop Bar (which kept us up all hours of the night on Friday because of the incredibly loud music and our proximity to the bar) and also that they were facing an office building and dumpster area. I now wish I wouldn’t have accepted this “solution”. 

Our other issue with the hotel is the housekeeping service. When we arrived the first day, our room still had items sitting out from the previous guest. This made us question if the sheets had been switched out, etc. The spoons in the coffee service area were dirty, the earliest our rooms were cleaned was 3:30 in the afternoon and we never received turn down service.

My family has stayed at numerous “luxury” hotels and this experience has by far been the most disappointing, especially for the price of the rooms. We would not recommend staying there and will not return in the future.

145,"What a find, so well situated and vibey","Hotel just been revamped, and we booked into a Trafalgar suite, which can accommodate 3 persons. I liked the new decor, really well done and the bar on the roof is very vibey and has amazing view of the city and lights, and if chilly they give you blankets, plus Trafalgar square etc. There are numerous tube stations close to the hotel, Charing cross and the embankment tubes, and it is a short walk to the Thames. Personally I found the hotel ideally situated for a visit to London and a great find for the future. Already recommended to my sons.",5,2018,07,19

145,Convenient location,The hotel is very well situated and the accommodation is well appointed (the hotel has recently been refurbished).

145,Trafakgar square,A great hotel with a perfect location. The staff was very helpful and the rooms and property were clean and pleasant. The one downside was the rooftop bar ( which they highly promote ) was closed to hotel guest two nights of out stay. They had private parties on both Friday and Saturday night. We unfortunately left on Sunday without experiencing the bar and its ( alleged) fantastic view of the city ,4,2018,07,16
145,In the middle of it all,"This hotel is close to just about everything. The hotel was under construction while we were there, but only caused minimal issues.

145,"Luxurious, Cozy and great views",this is probably among the best hotesl of London. I stayed there for a week and it blew my mind off by the rooftop bar and views it offers. The hotel is very centrally located right at the Trafalgar Square and the ambience inside is amazing .,4,2018,07,16
145,Elegant Hotel with First Class Service,Stayed 6 nights at this property.   The location is in Trafalgar Square.  The staff at check in were efficient and friendly.  The concierge booked our theatre tickets with best seats in the house. The room was spacious with exceptional beds and bedding. Large bathroom with a bath tub and shower.  The room was clean and daily housekeeping excellent.  Beautiful property fit for a Queen. Highly recommend.  ,5,2018,07,14
145,A real 5 Star personal experience,"Everyone we came in contact with was amazingly helpful and were so in a very proactive manner. We would like to point out some individuals that made our stay even better. First was Sarah who waited on us in the restaurant off the lobby. She was extremely knowledgeable and provided not only great service but also stellar recommendations based on our taste preferences. She was also very engaging in our conversations and provided a level of service that was personal and respectful. 

Also, on our last night we went up to the rooftop bar to have dinner and watch the sun go down over London. There we met Java who while only being there a couple months took incredible care of us. And not only taking excellent care of us but we also watched how she kept her eye on everything going on around her and drove a great experience for everyone. Absolute pleasure to meet her and have her contribute to an amazing evening for us.

Just as a mention. There was a blond lady running the desk at the downstairs entrance to the rooftop. She too was very engaging and helpful. In fact while we were there our room cards kept expiring and had to be reprogrammed. When we first went to her desk (which unbeknownst to us was for the rooftop restaurant) instead of just directing us away she smiled and kindly walked us over and helped us get back into our room.

Lastly, we would like to mention Ibby. He was extremely helpful even weeks leading up to our visit. His professionalism, skills and patience also enhanced our time there. Kudos to him as well. 

There were many others there too. All making sure we got what we needed and when. Even my wife mentioned how, as we left to meet our driver to the airport, one of the doorman walked us out and made sure we taken care of promptly. 

My wife and I travel. A lot. All over the world and this vacation was amazing and we consider it one of our very best. In many ways due to the hotel and our treatment by any and all staff. Please extend our personal thanks to everyone and we apologize for leaving so many people out.

145,Right in the Heart of it All,"Great location!  Right in Trafalgar Square makes a lot of the sites in London within walking distance. We were there for an extended weekend stay sandwiched in between our sojourn in Edinburgh. The staff (shout out to Carlo the concierge) was extremely helpful, knowledgeable and attentive. 

The rooms were just perfect. The refrigerator and all its items were free (i.e - included already in the price of the room) and the hotel qualifies as one of the best boutique hotels in which we've stayed .

I would make it a point to stay at this particular hotel each and every time I am in London!!",5,2018,07,10
145,Great London Location - no concierge lounge,"This was a special visit to London, and notes were sent via Hilton booking website.  Our Platinum status was recognized by a room upgrade to the 2nd floor (we always request highest available) and the view was surveying the dumpsters, and consequent noise below the window.  Spending the time and stress asking for improved accommodation and a consequent room move, was not conducive to this important visit.  Correct me if I am wrong, but I understand contractually, as a Platinum Elite, an upgrade comes as 'best available' - and not just the next type up.  Failure to look up member requests such as bed type, high/low floor and proximity to elevator, as available, including and any ""special requests"" is lacking attention to detail, if absolutely none of this is available, a simple acknowledgement or amenity is key to improved guest relations.  With decades of hotel experience, I can attest to the value of ensuring all frontline employees know their product, ensuring front desk workers get a visual and tactile tour of room types and location.  

Failure to acknowledge elite members is seemingly prevalent overseas, it means our loyalty then becomes split.  Last year in one conference alone, we hit the sales person's monthly, quarterly and annual $ goals.  Earnest apologies arrived on hindsight, as did a bottle of wine and chocolates, but it was all too late.  This is in part, why we took our following US conference to the Marriott chain for business.

Gripe aside, this really is an attractive hotel.  The rooms seem larger with high ceilings, décor is modern and accommodating.    Bathrooms, spacious and well lit, and the bed was extremely comfortable.  There is no elite member lounge, however it seemed that room service was available around the clock. I believe complimentary milk for tea/coffee is provided, I had to ask for it as there was none in the fridge.  The air conditioning worked very well during an unusual heat wave.
The location is across from Trafalgar Square & the National Art Gallery, an overall great spot for hitting the London iconic sites, and yet it feels more like a business hotel.
The breakfast was ridiculously slow.  They really need to find a better service flow.  There were a lot of staff doing several things, and none of it was serving people efficiently.  There is a fairly good buffet option, however 17 pounds for a mimosa was astounding.",3,2018,07,09
145,"Beautiful hotel, but expected more","I had such high expectations of this hotel. It was very clean, our room was nice and the beds were comfortable. It is ideal if you're looking to be centrally located. 

Unfortunately, we had booked this hotel in part for the rooftop bar and view and we didn't really get to utilize it. I would recommend asking if it will be open your entire stay if you want to spend time there. There were private some private events during our stay closing off a portion of the roof. The front desk staff did not realize that we were guests of the hotel so they were not accommodating until we noticed they let other guests upstairs and we re-approached them. To be honest, my friends and I did not feel very welcome at this hotel. We were often mistaken for public coming to the bar instead of guests and were stopped every time we entered the lobby before being able to proceed to the elevators. We stayed for 3 nights and this happened throughout our entire stay.

Despite this, I did want to mention that I had a great experience with the concierge team when I had a package mix up (I had been traveling and a phone was being delivered to the hotel, which arrived after I checked out). I greatly appreciated their help forwarding the package onto me!",4,2018,07,09
145,Welcome luxury ,"This little gem is located just off Trafalgar Square so an excellent location for seeing all the amazing sights and sounds that London has to offer.  The decor is classy and plush, the bedrooms wonderfully finished and beautifully appointed.  The staff are friendly and helpful and are genuinely welcoming.  All in all, rather fabulous!",5,2018,07,09
145,Great location poor service,"The location of this hotel is very central and well double glazed so there is no street noise. We stayed for 4 nights but two times we had problems with the cleaning service. First time was confusion with the maid. Second day when tried to complain, we had been out all day and returned at 4:30 and room wasn't cleaned got the answer"" the cleaners work to 6:30"". Reception staff not friendly. Very expensive for this weekend. Tried to visit the rooftop bar, but both times we tried told we need reservations",3,2018,07,09
145,Rooftop terrace for drinks and bites,"Went here for treat to celebrate my wife's birthday. due to the short notice we were not able to book, but I was advised if you arrive at 12o/c then there's almost always a table free. 
We got a great table with views over Trafalgar Square and some cocktails and snacks. Its not cheap, but it does have great views and the food was excellent.  We stayed three hours and there was no effort to move us along which was nice. I'd love to go back for an evening and see London by night with lights and darkness, but even on a sunny day with a slight breeze , it was wonderful to see the fluttering flags.",5,2018,07,09
145,The Trafalgar,"My friends and I arrived looking disheveled, hot and weary after walking 20 miles from Kent (a challenge we set ourselves). Having no reservation we tentatively asked if we could come in and have a drink, refreshment and some food. Half expecting to be turned away on account of how we looked (Pretty Woman shopping on Rodeo Drive sprung to mind!!) However your staff were extremely welcoming and fussed over our achievement. They were so lovely and we will definitely be back again and not looking so hot and bothered.  Such a lovely place.",5,2018,07,09
145,Excellent hotel,"Expensive but worth it. The location is excellent, very central but the hotel is in a quiet corner. The staff was very kind and helpful. The room was clean, reasonably sized. I felt very safe there, and this is important when you travel solo

",5,2018,07,06
145,pleasantly surprised,"Perfectly located in the heart of the city  with many eating option nearby ( own restaurant really good, I must say). Room size larger than usual for London. Small bathroom with a very large shower though. Hotel interiors  seem to be recently renovated. Free Minibar in the room with soft Drinks , Juice and water. Comfy bed and good sleeping quality. Lovely rooftop. Adequate breakfast with the option of one free item from the menu. I think it is a very good alternative for London, even though price is not inexpensive. Only discomfort was to find some open items in the Minibar  left by the previous guest ( sausages, fruit and yoghurt) that i threw away.",4,2018,07,04
145,Super,"Very friendly staff, great location, recently refurbished and dramatically upscaled: Quite a change from the old psychedelic funky place. The rooftop was not yet ready to reopen during my September 2017 stay. ",5,2018,07,02
145,Great location,This hotel is in a great location and hotel room is extremely comfortable. Most importantly there is air conditioning! It was hot when we were in London and this is a bonus. Overall great place to stay but staff is a bit stuffy.,4,2018,07,01
145,Awesome Hotel,"Perfectly located in an area that has easy access to many of the major sightseeing areas. The hotel was quiet, clean and had a staff that went out of the way to be helpful. I could not have picked a better place to stay and will definitely be back. ",5,2018,06,30
145,Fantastic Hotel in the Heart of London,"You can't beat the convenient location of the Trafalgar St. James!   You can walk to so much & the Charing Cross Tube stop is 2 minutes away!   This hotel is very well appointed with friendly staff!
 5 STARS",5,2018,06,29
145,Great Location,"We stayed in a double queen room as a family of 4, 2 adults and 2 teens.  Room was spacious for Europe.  Beds were comfortable and room was clean.  Had a few issues, room was not made up 1 day but rectified immediately, and OJ in the mini fridge was expired.  Staff were friendly and always willing to help.  We loved the location.  Several Tube stations and a bus stop nearby and easy to walk to many areas from the hotel. Would recommend to friends and family and would stay here again.",4,2018,06,29
145,"Fantastic hotel, great location, great amenities!","Perfect hotel for our short stay in London. The hotel itself is beautiful and the staff are beyond helpful. The restaurant/bar, rooftop all exceeded our expectations. And the gym was great. Will definitely be back next time we’re in town.",5,2018,06,29
145,Love this hotel!,The Trafalgar Suite was great for a family of 3! The step up area was great for our 15 year old daughter plus it has a vanity for make up and hair. Great location. The rooftop bar has a beautiful view of the city.,5,2018,06,29
145,Luxury in the heart of London...,"Stayed here at the early May bank holiday with my family...it was my first time in the heart of London! It was so convenient to get around from here! Links to shops and other parts of the City were quite convenient, in terms of location this is absolutely perfect! 
The hotel is absolutely amazing - modern chic! The staff here are very attentive and make you particularly special. Breakfast was sooooo goood!!! And if you choose to chill out at the bar, that works as well",5,2018,06,27
145,Bad service,"We chose this Hotel because of The Rooftop. They didn’t allow us to go up there. You have to have a reservation and The Hotel guest didn’t have priority. We tried to talk to The reseption twice. Both time they startet talking with someother guest - that didn’t stay at The Hotel- and forgot about us. We ended up leaving The Hotel without seeing The rooftop. My son was very disaoppointed. We didn’t feel welcome at this Hotel at all. Only good thing: location. But the price is to high, when we didn’t have access to the hole Hotel and det service was so bad.",1,2018,06,27
145,Perfect Location/Perfect Hotel,"It's sometimes challenging to be in a new city and know where to stay especially in relation to the major sights.  However, I have the perfect location to stay when in London - The Trafalgar St.James.  It is located on the corner overlooking Trafalgar Square, within walking distance of Westminster Abbey, Parliament, Leicester Square, Covent Garden and Piccadilly Circus! Not to mention the fact that the hotel is directly across the street from the National Gallery of Art and the Portrait Gallery (my personal favorite).  The hotel itself has had a major renovation within the last couple of years and is contemporary, chic, and hip.  The rooms and amenities are fabulous and you actually can feel like a star (or at least part of the super star's entourage)!    The staff are amazing, especially the Concierge service and everyone is friendly, helpful, efficient, and professional.  Everyone makes you feel welcome and special. I absolutely recommend The Trafalgar St. James to anyone visiting London",5,2018,06,26
145,Amazing stay!,"I stayed in Curio last weekend with my friend to celebrate our birthday! 
Dafne from Front Desk was looking after us and thanks to her our stay was even more enjoyable than we thought it can be! She went an extra mile and prepared a nice surprise for us in the room! It was very nice touch! Thank you!
Ps. Breakfast vas very nice as well.",5,2018,06,26
145,Excellent place to stay in London,Hotel is at a prime location and very centrally located.  The staff was very attentive.  One of the few hotels where we were able to find rooms with 2 queen beds.  Room was very comfortable.  We would definitely come back again!,5,2018,06,25
145,Nice Hotel,Bang opposite Trafalgar Square. Nice hotel. Good staff. Best part is that you are near SoHo and Many happening places. The bar down is always happening and busy every evening. Only drawback is that their is nothing in the Gym. Rooms are tight but hey it’s London.  ,4,2018,06,24
145,Fantastic room,"My room was not ready when I arrived at 230 but check in is 3 pm, said they would get it ready ASAP.
Went to the restaurant area & brought myself a pot of tea. Waited.
At 330 it was still not ready.
However they were very apologetic.
The room was worth the wait. Stunning.
View of Nelson’s column even from the bed!
Great location.
Went to the roof top bar. The staff up there were very rude. We were sat so we couldn’t even see the view & the music was so loud! Was I going to spend £20 on a drink? Nope.
We left best decision ever. Staff didn’t even say anything as we left... miserable lot.
Went to The Mint Leaf just up the road!
Fantastic cocktails fantastic food!

The concierge was a really helpful polite young man.
Pointed us in the direction of several good restaurants.
Also sorted out my transport to the airport.
Asset.
I would stay there again.",4,2018,06,24
145,First Class,What an amazing hotel. It should really be a 10 star hotel. Stay were great. Hotel was chic. Rooms were spacious and clean. Breakfast was delicious. Views from the rooftop was priceless. We were very well looked after. We'll stay again on our next visit. Hopefully Reda and Max are still there as they were the best hotel staff we have ever come across.,5,2018,06,23
145,A Great hotel on Trafalgar Sq.,"I stayed for three nights at the Trafalgar St. James (Trafalgar Hilton). Even though the lobby and entrance was under construction I received a warm welcome. The hotel even had a small birthday cake for me waiting in room (my birthday was the day I arrived). The room was big, clean, with a very comfortable bed. The breakfast room was well appointed with a good selection of breakfast options.The location was great for sightseeing (right on Trafalgar Sq. and the Mall) and close to parks and public transit.",5,2018,06,19
145,PHENOMENAL,"I simply cannot praise this hotel and its staff enough. Whilst being a member of several hotel programs I have never experience such service, courtesy and exceptional attention to detail. 

The service is unrivalled, you will not find staff with a greater desire to help than you do at the Trafalgar St James Curio Collection. Nothing is too small, every little detail is significant to staff. Two member of staff who need recognition are Dafne and Westley, they pulled out all of the stops and made my stay the most memorable I have ever had, I cannot thank them enough for this magical experience.

Further thanks goes to Elodie and Federico as well as the rest of the wonderful team for their efforts and attention. 

The location is perfect with many rooms having direct views onto Trafalgar Square, which is such a satisfying and beautiful view. If your room doesn't have this phenomenal view then the roof top bar certainly does. Sensational views.

The food is delicious and the restaurant service was great. One of the best starters I have ever had, (try the Italian beef). On one occasion there was a slight delay with my main course. Nevertheless, it was a minor delay and given the quality of the rest of the stay this issue did not ruin it in anyway.

The Landseer suite itself, was one of the most beautiful accommodations I have ever seen. Open plan suites are far superior and inclusive in my opinion than segregated room suites. They provide the guest with a much more grand and satisfying experience. A slight issue with cleaning, a couple of missed areas and a couple of minor maintenance issues but again nothing on a scale that could not even come close to dampering the stay.

On the whole the stay was wonderful, and even though there was a couple of MINOR MINOR issues, it is still the best stay I have ever had in any hotel. Furthermore, many thanks for the extra support and efforts in celebration for making it to Diamond membership! 

I will clarify that these minor issues I mention are only down to the rebranding and reopening of the hotel. It is entirely natural and expect that a hotel in its first year of rebranding/opening occur some minor issues (teething problems). Being someone who has experienced a lot of hotels, it is natural. My opinion of this hotel is NOT diminished in anyway by these tiny setbacks.

I cannot thank the team at The Trafalgar St James enough. It is an incredible hotel with exceptional staff and I encourage EVERYONE to visit this phenomenal establishment! THANK YOU CURIO TEAM! A wonderful stay!",5,2018,06,19
145,Superb Service,"Visited London for a few days before we went on a Mediterranean Cruise.  I booked this hotel.  The staff was amazing, helpful before the trip also setting up a day trip and transportation for me.  I really can’t say enough about our experience here.  Excellent staff, well appointed room, close to everything!  Will definitely stay here again!",5,2018,06,18
145,Outstanding Hotel at a perfect crossroads,"Stayed here August 2017. Hotel was in final stages of renovation, which did not impede the experience. Nice rooms, easy walking distance to the underground, the Thames and Pall Mall. WONDERFUL restaurant with an excellent wine selection. Looking forward to my next trip.",5,2018,06,18
145,Great Transformation,"Stayed here for 2 nights from Friday through Sunday, great location and a stunning transformation from the Old Trafalgar.
Location, location, location.
You are right in the middle of the city with Trafalgar Square being a step away and easy access to all of the major tourist area’s - Leicester Square, St James Park, The Mall, Buckingham Palace, Oxford St, Covent Garden, & Regent St, The Eye & Westminster are also close by. Easy access to the Underground just by Trafalgar Square are just across the road from the hotel.
Had initial reservations about the roof top bar, but it had won me over by the end of the night.
The rooms have also undergone a complete transformation & the bathroom has a great walk in shower and the bed was very comfortable – there was also a free minibar full of soft drinks & waters which were great to have after a day walking around London. Breakfast was excellent with a range of cereals, meats, cheeses, pastries, and fruit as well as your Full English and a variety of omelets.
I will definitely recommend this hotel to any of my friends who are looking to for a short break  in London.",4,2018,06,18
145,Exceptional Central London Hotel,"I stayed here for a few days for a quick vacation to London. The location of this hotel is unbeatable - you are right in the middle of the city with Trafalgar Square outside the front door. You are a quick walk from Leicester Square (a major nightlife area), St James Park, and Buckingham Palace. Oxford St and Regent St are also close by. For destinations further away, the Underground has an entrance to the Northern and Bakerloo lines right outside the hotel.

As for the hotel itself the King room I had wasn't huge but it seemed bigger than it was because of the high ceilings. The bathroom had a great walk in shower and the bed was very comfortable - I slept well every night. A nice perk was the free minibar full of soft drinks (including those lovely small european coke bottles) and waters which were great to have after a day walking around London. Breakfast was excellent - even if you don't get it as a rewards benefit from the hotel it would be worth the money in my opinion. You also have an in-room ipad which can be used to order room service and look up hotel info - this is a really cool feature and I wish more hotels in the states had something similar. The basic breakfast buffet includes all sorts of meats, cheeses, pastries, and fruit and you can order more substantial things a la carte. The eggs benedict was great. I did have room service and while it was pricey (room service always is) the quality was very good as well. Another nice feature of this hotel is the rooftop bar - definitely a good place to have a few drinks to start off or wrap up a night.

I should also add that the hotel staff and the concierge desk is very friendly and helpful. If you want to know a good place to go for something - just ask! All the recommendations I got were on point. I don't know the next time I will make it back to London but I would definitely stay here again when I do and I will recommend this hotel to any of my friends looking to go to London as well.",5,2018,06,14
145,"Lovely hotel, extremely hospitable staff.","The room was impeccably outfitted with every convenience I could have wanted (multi-setting lighting system for night, day, sleep, ambience; a fireplace in the sitting area, tablet-based room service ordering, a TV above the bathtub...I could go on and on!). It was clean as a whistle. The staff were helpful and went above and beyond to make my stay a success. Highly recommended.",5,2018,06,14
145,Quick trip with a perfect stay! ,"Stayed at the St James for two nights on our way to Greece. From my first contact with the concierge Daniel, my stay was off to a great start.  The hotel is in a perfect location. The first hours we were able to walk to Buckingham Place, Westminster Abby, Big Ben, which unfortunately  is under construction and walked to dinner in the Covenant Garden area. The hotel rooms are very well appointed and the breakfast equally great!  Service with a smile all the through. Rooftop was great for a drink and a beautiful view of the city. Will definitely return to this hotel for my next longer visit to this beautiful city. A special shout out to Daniel Nowak as he was a great help before I arrived and then helped with my bags when we did arrive! Super guy!  Great hotel the St James is, so don’t think twice about staying here as you will be happy you did! ",5,2018,06,14
145,By far the best hotel!!!,"We stayed at this hotel for 8 days and the whole experience from food, room and hospitality was simply top notch. The best thing about this hotel is it’s location!!! The centre of everything in London and walking distance to all the tourist spots, restaurants, shops etc. Loved it.",5,2018,06,12
145,"Smarts and different feel to your average hotel, great location and staff",Stylish hotel right on Trafalgar Square.  Staff were unfailingly polite and helpful.  Rooms are smallish like most London hotels but very well furnished.  Particularly liked the basic fee mini bar of non alcoholic drinks and having a small milk in the fridge to use with the nespresson machine is a very nice touch.  Best hotel I have stayed at in London in a long time and was great value for money. Will definitely stay again,5,2018,06,11
145,Perfect location,"If you need a base for a few days in London then this is the perfect spot. Right on your doorstep you have the iconic Trafalgar Square but the hotel is just on a sidestreet so it's not traffic at your feet.  If you're a Monopoly player, everything on the board is walking distance..Regent St, Oxford St, Piccadily....of course avoid jail at all costs.
The hotel itself is lovely, rooms are spacious, the rooftop bar is great and you make friends in the elevator on the way up.
All in all, highly recommended.",5,2018,06,11
145,Fabulous central London hotel,"The room was fabulous and very well appointed down to the smallest details.  Moulton Brown toiletries were provided as well as robes and slippers.  The cocktail menu is a must and breakfast was delicious. Staff were friendly, helpful and attentive.  This hotel had the feel of a smaller boutique hotel with a theme of music/film stars both past and present and was certainly a find in central London.  Highly recommended.",5,2018,06,11
145,Wondrous - As usual,"The Trafalgar St James ceases to amaze. Once again, truly wonderful service, product and staff. The Trafalgar St James truly creates a wondrous place in peoples lives. Special mention to Fabrizio, Adrian, Miklos and the entertaining Irish man milling about the lobby. Can’t wait to go back...",5,2018,06,10
145,Outstanding property,"FABULOUS room, great view, a wonderful place to close my eyes and night, have a restful sleep, and open them in the morning.

I was so comfortable in my room that I felt rested and wonderful during the day.great as well.  

The service and food were great as well.  I loved the breakfast! 

A bit of history.  In one of the rooms that is a mini suite today the president of the Whitestar Cruise Line received the call that thew Titanic had struck an iceberg!",5,2018,06,10
145,Nice hotel great location ,"We had a couple days in London on our way to Greece so we wanted to maximize our ability to see the sites by choosing a prime location. The Trafalgar did the trick with quick access to Parliament, Big Ben, the London Eye and all points in between. The rooms were nice the staff was friendly but the location was the key feature. We will probably stay there again it went so well. ",5,2018,06,09
145,First (not last) time in London ,"This was the first time in London for my wife and I and this hotel was truly a highlight of our trip. The best thing is the AMAZING location. You can walk to all of the entertainment areas such as Leicester Square, Covenant Garden & Piccadilly Circus. The property is beautiful and the service is great. I want to give a special thank you to Adrian who is one of the Concierges. This gentlemen took care of my wife and I from the moment we walked in the hotel until the moment that we walked out. He provided restaurant recommendations, directions, information on entertainment and set up our transportation to the airport. I just can’t come up with enough superlatives to describe how helpful he was.",5,2018,06,08
145,Nice and central location,"Stayed at The Trafalgar St James for 2 nights. The room was clean and a nice size. I found the hotel walking distance to everything. The hop on hop off bus station was on the same block. The Art Gallery was across the street. You walk to Piccadilly where most of the action was happening. I found the restaurant expensive in the hotel, but this is a luxury hotel so you would expect it. There are a lot of other restaurants just outside of the hotel. This hotel has a roof top lounge. It's really nice and has nice view over looking the city. Again, i thought the drinks were over priced. The staffs were very friendly and the bell boys were always ready to help or answer any questions. I would stay here again because of the service, cleanliness, and mainly location. ",5,2018,06,07
145,Fantastic location and Great Staff.,Great rooms and amenities.  The staff is extremely helpful.  The hotel is perfectly located for access to the buses and tube.   Make sure to go up to the rooftop bar and have a cocktail in the evening.  The view is great. ,5,2018,06,07
145,Xcellent property at great location,"Great experience starting from arrival. Were given an early check in, the rooms were spacious and well laid out. Concierge was very friendly. The location is phenomenal and almost all of the attractions are within walking distance or short drive. Must stay property",5,2018,06,07
145,"Extremely enjoyable stay, friendly & helpful staff.","Exceptional stay due to the front desk staff and in particular Carlo at the Concierge Desk and Wesley in the restaurant. Both were extremely helpful and we could not ave been treated better. A great view from the roof garden!

The hotel is centrally located which made travel very easy.

Now for the bad. We had some irratic room service as we had to call for either bathroom supplies or fridge supplies that had not been stocked. Not a big deal but we had to ask for items on 3 occasions during a 7 day stay which seemed excessive. 

All in all, an exceptional stay! We were in room 523.

",4,2018,06,06
145,Great hotel in the center of London,"Loved the modern room, rooftop restaurant, room service , helpful staff and being in a convenient center of London for exploring either on foot or tube.  I did not find this hotel pricey for the location. Yes, you may pay a little more, but you are in the heart of things.
To be in a busy area, the hotel was extremely quiet.",5,2018,06,06
145,Beautiful property but pricey,Great location and gorgeous property with trendy rooftop bar and great view.   Luxurious rooms and baths (separate tub and shower).  Excellent breakfast (included with Hilton Honors status).   Convenient lobby bar.   Service (particularly at the bar) was less than stellar. ,5,2018,06,05
145,"Clean, friendly and quiet","I realy recomend This hotel . The location is excellent for shopping and sightseeing. The staff is very efficient, helpfull and very friendly. The cleaners keept our room fresh and tidy. Nice and good bar , with Nice drinks and Happy staff. The room was big and spacious, the bed soft and i sleept like a baby. The Whole hotell is clean and tidy. ",5,2018,06,05
145,Three satisfied dinners,"Thursday, night after an event, 3 of us were hungry and wanted eat somewhere special to celebrate.  We chose to dine in the hotel restaurant family friendly).   We ordered bread and olive oil & Jerba olives.  When the bread arrived it had just came fresh out of the oven, we fell upon it and mopped up the oil. Skipping the starters we'd ordered main courses, my 14 year old guest, ordered Pulled lamb burger, without Harissa, Tazatziki or sweat potato fries, and asked for extra cheese & normal french fries & to drink a berry tea tale mooctail , his mum ordered the Chilli, Garlic & Sumac Glazed Chicken, spring onion, sesame and side order of Roasted sweet potato, paprika, yoghurt, her beverage was a Aperol Sprittz, I went for the Puy Lentil Moussaka, ricotta, roasted peppers & side order of broccoli, garlic,chilli and bottle of still water. We all went silent, then about half way through the meal, started to voice our opinions, 14 year old, said 'its best burger I've eaten (a burger expert) mum thought the chicken was delicious, as was her her side, me liked my main and was glad my side dish was extra spicy to balance my meal.  The lad and I went for deserts, he had the Chocolate Ganache, Thyme Custard  toasted sesame and I had the Warm Date & Walnut Cake, stem ginger & Ice cream. All in all, we were content, what with the service by Genera, he was really good and had guided us through the menu, the result was, we all enjoyed our dinning experience and went home happy.",5,2018,06,02
145,pish not posh,"stayed here because it is a Hilton property and I am brand loyal and wanted an American hotel.  Not at all like most Hiltons, lacks American conveniences, and hospitality.  Sort of a European boutique type hotel that wants to be posh.  room had no desk and no comfortable place to work at the computer.  furnished with back copies of Harpers Bazaar and Conde Nast and a fussy little coffee maker that made only demitasse coffees.  Breakfast buffet - no coffee or water, you must order these from the waiter.  Food selection was good but all cold.  Staff try hard but only the concierge was fluent in english; the rest of the staff, mostly eastern Europeans, struggle with english.  Great location, half a block from the tube, and many restaurants and pubs nearby.  But I have decided that almost all locations in central London are good as long as they are within a block of the tube.  Found this hotel to be fussy and despite its attempts to be elegant, not up to Hilton standards.",3,2018,06,02
145,Great Experience in the Center of it all,"We spent five nights at the Trafalgar on our first visit to London. We used a combination of Hilton points and cash, and it was the priciest of the options provided via Hilton. We were very pleased with the hotel. It's in a great location on Trafalgar Square, steps away from the Charring Station tube stop and easy walking distance to Soho, Covent Garden, and Piccadilly. Even Westminster is only a 15-minute walk away. The hotel looks very new. Nice lobby bar, Comfy bed. Strong shower. And quiet, except for the occasional slamming door when people exit their rooms. They really should find a way to make the door closings a little quieter. Breakfast buffet was included with our room rate (we are Hilton Honors) that includes cheeses, meat, pastries, oatmeal, cereal, yogurt, and fruit. Also al la carte available. Rooftop bar that we did not use. Overall, great selection, just pricey.

One suggestion for those traveling from Heathrow. We booked (bought online to save time) our two-way tickets on the Heathrow Express, which whisks you from the airport to Paddington Station in abut 15 minutes. After our long red-eye flight we figured it would be easier to just take a cab to the hotel instead of trying to learn how to use the tube then, although we planned on doing so a bit later. Mistake. London traffic is horrible. The cab ride (with a very friendly cabbie) took about 40 minutes, although it was probably only 5-6 miles and cost 35 pounds, which is crazy. On the way back, after learning the tube, we walked from the hotel to Charring tube stop, caught the brown line direct to Paddington, walked out of the tube station across the courtyard to the Heathrow Express station, and then hopped on. Total time from walking out of our hotel to stepping off the Heathrow Express--40 minutes! Cost three pounds each. I'd suggest buying your Oyster card and taking the brown line to Charring. No need to change trains. Almost no way to screw it up. ",5,2018,06,01
145,Centrally Located,"Great location, convenient access to restaurants, bars, attractions and underground. Staff was very friendly and eager to help. Parking can be a bit tough, as with most Hilton Hotels in large cities you have to pay your own way and the garage is not owned by the hotel. The hotel does offer a discount though through the concierge, but you have to ask. 

Would highly recommend this location for anyone wanting to see downtown London!",4,2018,05,30
145,Ticks off everything for a 5 star hotel ,"Loved this hotel. Location, the rooms and a great breakfast, but most importantly a genuine friendliness and fantastic service. It’s rare to find a true 5 star, but this one ticks off all the boxes. A new favorite in London.
",5,2018,05,29
145,Amazing Location,"Let's start with the positives. As many have said, the location of this hotel is amazing. Our room was quiet one of the two nights we were there. We were able to check in at 2:00, when we arrived. The rooftop bar has great views and the breakfast has a great selection. 

The not-so positive. Our room was on the 3rd floor and faced the office building at the back. Not a problem the first night - all was quiet, but our second night was a Friday and there was a party in the private section of the rooftop bar, which was above us. (There are six floors of rooms.) The music was loud and with a lot of base. I called the front desk, and their response was ""sorry"" nothing they could do. I can't imagine how loud it was in the rooms above us! 

I'm not a fan of the new design in bathrooms, which seem to be designed for business men. (I'm a woman.) The showers have no ledge so good luck shaving your legs! Also, there was little space to sit anything around the sink. The sink was large and took up the entire stand it was on. Also, the bathroom door handle came off and we were afraid to shut the door in case it wouldn't open. 

The rooftop bar is very small, and can be very windy and cold. I asked for a blanket and that did help.

Lastly, they charged us for a breakfast we did not have although they were good about taking the charge off.",4,2018,05,29
145,"Central, Comfortable and Good Value","We have stayed at this hotel a number of times over the last 10 years, because of its central location, but the last time, it was a bit tired.  Just stayed here again and it has been transformed.  the refurbishment is a total success: very nice lobby and dining area, rooms are great (terrific shower and nice beds).  

The location at the corner of Trafalgar Square is central and walkable to most of the sights, the theatre district and the parks.

And the price is not outrageous, as most of Central London is.  Great value!",5,2018,05,28
145,Great room but bathroom was terrible,"The hotel is very nice and well located for site seeing. Nicely appointed and friendly staff. However our bathroom was a pit of misery - the hot water handle for the sink would fall off when using, the toilet would run excessively, and the fancy push button shower control didn’t function one day. I was a plumbing repair person mutillle times during our stay at a very expensice hotel. I expected much better and was obviously disappointed. ",3,2018,05,28
145,Location was excellent,A great hotel with an excellent location. Within walking distance to many sites and transportation/undergound stations. Service was excellent and I would highly recommend the rooftop bar. Can't go wrong staying at this location.,5,2018,05,24
145,Perfect,"So big news for visitors to our Capital-here is a hotel which is as good as you had always hoped. No rudeness, tiny overpriced room and sloppy service here. Praise be! In fairness to Hilton they are getting a lot right here-their Southwark and London Bridge venues are great too. 

Location is movie location ideal. Main door Trafalgar Sq and the magnificence of Nelson and his column. To the left Mayfair, to the right Theatre Land, Soho and Covent Garden. Tourists’ Position A. 

Check in and Check out personal friendly and attentive. In London? Oh yes. Concierge so good he gave vital heads up on the non running of Heathrow Express the day of our departure. Life saving. Certainly flight saving. Forever in his debt. 

Rooftop bar to die for. Residents’ privileges too, as it should be on a busy holiday weekend. Lunch and evening drinks great. Service just bedding in here. Easily sorted. No fuss 

Room my partner described as “the best and most thoughtfully appointed room”. Everything you could wish for, where you want it. Ask for room with view. Not those that look into opposite office block. We moved. Once again. No fuss. Customer satisfaction matters. Yay!! Finally!! These customers will return. That’s what it’s all about right? ",5,2018,05,24
145,Great Stay!,"We just returned from London and really enjoyed our stay at The Trafalgar St. James. The location is great for a visit as a tourist. We were able to walk to many sights very easily. You are right across the street from Trafalgar Square and the view from the rooftop bar is great. We enjoyed our modern decor room. The bed was very comfortable, we did not hear any outside noise even though we were on floor 1 (second floor.) The complimentary minibar was nice. I appreciated the lit magnified makeup mirror in the bathroom. 

Service was very good and everyone was friendly and polite. The concierge was very helpful in suggesting nearby restaurants for dinner. The rooftop bar is very popular and gets very crowded so make a reservation if you want to go up on  a sunny day. The service there was only so-so, but the view is special. 

We will return!",5,2018,05,23
145,perfect stay for a business trip,"As I business traveller, I got all I need.

A comfortable bed to sleep well to be energised
A quite room that had some style
A nice coffee table to work on
Some complementary drinks from the bar to stay hydrated
an ironing board to iron my shirt for the meeting
a good location so that I got to the place where I wanted to go.
An opportunity to have breakfast",5,2018,05,23
145,"Great location and service, but...","Perfectly sized, clean and quiet rooms in Central London.   We loved the free minibar.   The problem was breakfast consisted of only breads, cold cheese, cereals, yogurt and fruit.   Ordering eggs will mean paying an extra £7.    ",4,2018,05,20
145,Rooftop bar an absolute gem,"Delighted to have secured a booking for 16 or so of us following a wonderful celebration day at Buckingham Palace, an easy walk up The Mall & this glorious find tucked to the left of the National Portrait Gallery didn’t fail. A warm welcome, we were swiftly shown the lift & stepped out into an absolute suntrap with professional staff, chilled Prosecco & delicious small plates of quality food. 

Everyone was thrilled & the day, already memorable had become exceptional. Can’t recommend the venue enough. ",5,2018,05,17
145,Absolutely Wonderful Hotel in the middle of it all…,"Truly a wonderful hotel right in the middle of it all! From the moment we were received at the front door by the bellman Michael Neal to our departure four days later, we were treated like the Royalty! The concierge Ibby made sure each morning with his beautiful smile that we were taken care of regarding our plans for the day. The bar staff and restaurant team were also a delight to be around. Quick note: The rooftop bar and restaurant are wonderful, though please know you should book a reservation well ahead of time.

Outside of the outstanding location with wonderfully appointed and quite rooms, what makes this hotel so enjoyable is the team members.  From the bellman receiving you at the front door to the folks in the restaurant receiving you for breakfast, everyone has a smile on their face while making sure you are treated like the folks just down the street in Buckingham Palace.

My highest compliments to all!",5,2018,05,17
145,Great hotel in a great location,"Stayed here for a weekend away, the rooms are very cool (if a little small) everywhere is beautifully decorated. Even though part of Hilton it has a boutique feel. Great breakfast too! 

Location is perfect for seeing a show, a little shopping and a little site seeing! 

Also Milton brown toiletries which were a nice bonus as usually don’t pay attention to them 😁
",5,2018,05,15
145,Best hotel in London,"I've never felt more welcomed and comfortable in a hotel, let alone a hotel in London.  They very warmly let us check in very early as we had just arrived after our red eye from the States. We were so happy to be able to drop our bags and shower before heading out to explore London.  The room was normal size by American standards which is very large by European standards, and was very modern and comfortable.  Also, they kept us well stocked on waters and even brought us a plate of fruit one evening which was a very nice touch.  The location is perfect.  Right next to the royal drive to Buckingham and walkable to many of the best neighborhoods to explore.  Going a little further?  There are 2 tube stations within a 5 minute walk.  The best part of this hotel is the amazing staff.  From check in to check out, everybody we spoke to was happy to help.  The concierge, Carlo, helped us with many random requests which we greatly appreciated, he was awesome.  Also, the open air rooftop bar is one of the best views of London I've seen.  Do not hesitate to book here, you will be well taken care of.",5,2018,05,14
145,Weekend In London ,"Stayed here on a weekend break for one night using points as a reward stay through Hilton Honours, Grate location! Helpful staff with the exception of Saturday nights concierge! Stayed on floor 3 found the room to be very noisy until the pumping music ended at 3am!! Resulting it very little sleep. 
Overall considering the cost of what the room should have been, I’ve left feeling somewhat unrewarded! So wouldn’t rush back! ",3,2018,05,13
145,Just wow,"Using my Hilton points, my wife and I wanted a weekend away in London.  We found this hotel listed on the Hilton website expecting just another Hilton hotel.  How wrong we were!  This hotel is truly spectacular.  The level of service is brilliant.  The view from the bar on the roof is brilliant.   The breakfast is yummy.

We have stayed at many of the best hotels in London and this one surpassed them all.

With its central location and the all the above it is my place to stay in London from now on!",5,2018,05,10
145,Paul Hunt,"We stayed here for 2 nights this bank holiday weekend. I never write reviews but felt compelled to do so in his case. What a wonderful hotel and the room we were given was fabulous value for money compared to other 5 star hotels we have visited in London. Excellent location and cleanliness and a special mention for William, one of the reception managers who was very pleasant, helpful and unlike a lot of people in his position just a nice bloke. Looking forward to visiting again soon. ",5,2018,05,09
145,Just Spectacular ,"I was upgraded to a King room with upper level with couch, dressing table and coffee table. One of the loveliest rooms I have ever stayed in.  The bathroom was spectacular as well. There is an espresso maker and free minibar too.  

The staff is professional and welcoming. I was given a 2pm checkout as a Gold member as well as a free breakfast buffet.

The rooftop bar has extraordinary views, a great feel and wonderful drinks.

The location is amazing, right at Trafalgar Square.

Can you say perfect?",5,2018,05,09
145,Might be my favorite Hilton ever,We stayed for 2 nights on vacation and when we arrived it was pouring down rain and we were exhausted. We were able to check in early and even got upgraded. The room is clean and the bathroom was big. There were plenty of power outlets for charging all our electronics. The hotel has a cool rock and roll vibe to it and everything feels clean and new and fresh. All the staff is very nice and helpful. This location was perfect. You are right off Trafalgar square and can walk to everything. Would recommend this hotel to anyone going to London for a vacation.,5,2018,05,08
145,Just amazing!,Great hotel with a great interior design. The staff is very friendly and we got an excellent service throughout our stay. Hats off to the concierge who recognised us when we walked in to remind us we had received a package. It’s those minor things that give a personal touch and make this place more than amazing. The other star during our stay was the breakfast! It would not be a lie when I say that I was looking forward to breakfast every morning (get the pancakes!). The one minor point was that the dinner at the restaurant downstairs paled in comparison to the breakfast. If the dinner would get the same attention as the breakfast this would be a complete knock out of the park.,5,2018,05,08
145,"GREAT HOTEL, BUT CUSTOMER SERVICE RUINED IT...","Our family of four were delayed thru Heathrow so we jumped on Trip Advisor and found this hotel. Decided on it for location which didn't disappoint - you can easily crush most of the major sites in a few hours by staying here. Hotel was great, nothing exceptional but clean and not bad food. In fairness, we arrived around 8pm one evening and were gone first thing the next morning so we can't give a great account to all they have to offer. And the hotel and restaurant staff were great. My issue falls AFTER we arrived back in Canada and received a visa statement with an extra $1,100 of charges?!?!?! After approx 10 emails and one month, I received a credit for PART of the charges with no explanation as to why we were charged in the first place..? But I have yet to receive a detailed invoice for the rest of the charges. I have called all of the customer service numbers provided, including long distance calls to London, and sent countless emails. No one will give me an answer. They continue to say ""we will get back to you in three business days"". Well that was April 19...it's now May 7. So so frustrating on a consumers end. I don't understand why customer service has gone this way?!? It seems everywhere you look nowadays companies pride themselves on customer service, then don't deliver, and don't care. I'm sure this post will receive a ""sorry for your inconvenience, we will be in touch"" and they won't. While this hotel has a great location and other enticing amenities, I'd only recommend it if you want to chance chasing the company to receive your overcharges back, for months after your visit. Way to go Hilton.",3,2018,05,07
145,Nice renovation with some reservation,"We have stayed at this hotel many times and this was the first since the recent renovation throughout. They did a very nice job on both the public spaces and the rooms. The staff is extremely nice and helpful. The location could not be better. The breakfast was nice and plentiful. The bathroom however could have been more well thought out. The shower looks very nice but it is quite small with an uncomfortable place to stand given the position of the shower head.

Be aware of the pricing structure. What they refer to as junior suites is nothing like one would expect in that it is rather small for a suite and includes a half glass wall with two steps up to a sofa...and that is all. We were upgraded to this room but I would not want to pay for it. 

They know that they have an excellent location and they charge for it.",4,2018,05,06
145,Great place to stay in London,"Spent a week and the experience at the hotel wonderful.  Staff courteous, especially the concierge desk which was very helpful and accommodating.  Forgot conversion plug and had one to use instantly.  WiFi throughout the hotel with very good coverage.  The perk of a stocked fridge with water and beverages nice.  Really quiet and comfortable room with great blackout curtains to get over jet lag easily.  Central location makes for great walking to nearby museums and restaurants.  Breakfast dining very good and rooftop restaurant has great views of city in the evening, even if just sitting and sipping a glass of wine.  The system of using room keycard to access floors with the elevator an extra level of security that was appreciated.",5,2018,05,02
145,Never again...,"I was excited to stay here based on their website but sadly my check in experience with staff was not a good one and my stay went downhill from there......a toilet that wouldn’t flush and had to be fixed a total of 3 times in a 4 day stay, bathroom lights that surged on and off continually, being woken up at 9.30 am by housekeeping actually in the room cleaning and who didn’t leave when I jumped out of bed startled.......one of the worst hotel experiences I have had.",2,2018,05,02
145,Location!,"Very nice hotel, friendly staff and spacious room (kingsize bed). Breakfast was also very good. Only downside was the cleaning (as it is so often...). Not entirely clean in corners and under furniture. 
Overall it was an excellent stay anyway. The location couldnt be better!",5,2018,05,02
145,A phenomenal hotel in the heart of London,This was my first time overseas and this hotel was absolutely incredible. My wife and I decided to go to England for our 10th anniversary and we had the best trip we’ve ever had. My brother and his wife had stayed here in 2014 and they said how wonderful this hotel was. They were definitely right by saying what they said. That made our decision in where to stay so much easier. The staff at this hotel was wonderful. The room was big and spacious and clean. There are a lot of restaurants and sightseeing attractions within a close proximity to this hotel. And we paid a rate that was affordable. We will definitely return again if were ever London bound again. A+ stay,5,2018,05,01
145,Amazing trip and the hotel 7 star for me,"This was my 8th time in London and my first time y this hotel.
The hotel is perfect, the location is the best, near from the tube station, from the Thames,  so we were able to easily explore local attractions such as the natural history and science museums as well as Harrods. the neighborhood is very safe.

The room was absolutely amazing - top class luxury at every turn. 

The menu of the  hotel restaurants were fantastic"" and the breakfast is delicious. The rooftop is amazing, The attention to detail is amazing. It was absolutely perfect in every way.

We spend new year eve, and the capacity of the hotel was full, but all team members are very kind. The Trafalgar St James staff are probably one of the most special assets of the hotel - incredibly friendly, helpful and welcoming.  Carolina from the rooftop and Bruno from the lobby  were particularly great!

I cannot stress enough just how great the entire experience was and we will definitely be coming back!
",5,2018,04,29
145,Loving London even more,"My husband and I arrived on a Friday morning from the airport, with traffic being quite a struggle to get to Trafalgar square.  We have stayed at the Hilton Doubletree Westminster a couple of times and thought we would try a different hotel.   However, during the cab ride in we felt as though we may have made a mistake as traffic wasn't quite as bad to that area.    As soon as we arrived at the hotel, they greeted us at the door,  took our luggage and proceeded to get us checked in.     Unfortunately, our room wasn't ready yet, but they offered us access to the breakfast and placed our luggage in a holding area.   We decided to go out and explore a bit before the pub tour we had scheduled that afternoon.    After returning to the hotel, they again greeted us and escorted us to our room, where they had already taken our luggage.    That night we had an amazing experience just having a cup of tea at the rooftop lounge overlooking London.   The service was impeccable and I cannot imagine staying anywhere else in the city now.     After traveling to Cornwall and Wales through the week, we returned for our last night in London and again were treated to a wonderful experience.    We will definitely stay here again and would recommend it to anyone considering coming to London to stay here.",5,2018,04,29
145,Great location,"Stayed here for four nights.  Unfortunately was here at the same time as the Commonwealth leaders summit so roads around Trafalgar square were hellish.  This made coming in difficult and for an expensive taxi ride.  Once we found the hotel it was pleasant.  Checkin staff were friendly if you got a younger staff member.  At times I noticed an older blonde ( ? Supervisor) and she never once smiled or even said hello to people.  

Concierge staff are very friendly and helpful and are the stars of this hotel apart from location.  Location is excellent.  Right across from the Canadian Consulate and Trafalgar square.  A few minutes walk to the national gallery and a few more to soho and Leicester square. Easy getting show ticks and easy walk to all the theatres.  

Upgraded myself to the St James room. Was nice and you get four small bottles of coke  a day along with two sparkling and two still bottles of water a day in the minibar.  

Unfortunately our first night was inundated with loud bangs and heavy footfall of the people above us. We were on the 3rd floor. I was told it was worse for noise on the 5 and 6 as there is a rooftop bar and potential for noise is worse.  We complained the next morning and we decided to upgrade to a bigger room facing Canada house for 40 pounds more.  I figured out what was making the loud banging noise.  The washroom door has a door stop but is made of metal and whenever you opened the door it would hit the bathtub and cause noise.  The closet and cupboard doors have no plastic stops so when you close them they make loud bangs.  So overall noise sound proofing could be better and easily improved if they wanted to wth cheap and simple fixes. 

Dislikes were the housekeeping.  After they cleaned a team would go around and do an inspection.  Every day they would have to come back with something they missed and one day my wife’s popcorn went missing in the plastic bag it was in.  

Overall good location and would recommend.  Would give a higher rating if they fix the noise issues (door stops and plastic cupboard stops).

145,Phenominal Experience in Prime Location!,"Incredible hotel in the heart of London.

Perfect for those looking for a modern and upbeat hotel. Rooftop bar views A+",5,2018,04,27
145,Made London London,We could not have picked a better spot to stay for our trip to London.  Not only is it perfectly located but the team there was BEYOND exceptional.   They never let us forget the English charm from morning to night.  We will be back again with our family.,5,2018,04,26
145,A wonderful experience,"My wife and I absolutely loved this hotel! We're big fans of Curios properties and this one really hits the mark. The Trafalgar St. James blends luxury with down-to-earth attitude and presentation. Rooms are nicely appointed with a reasonable size - a little bigger than you might expect for London - and luxurious bathrooms. The staff was very friendly and outgoing. This is a great place to stay if you're looking for luxury surroundings without a stuffy attitude.

Breakfast was excellent - a very good value, especially if you get it included with your rate/status benefits; a nice, varied spread of meats, cheeses, pastries, yogurts and cereals. 

The rooftop bar and restaurant was also enjoyable; good views of the London skyline, inventive cocktails and a good prix fixe menu.

The location is terrific - right across from Trafalgar Square but not too loud inside. Easy access to Charing Cross station, and not too bad a walk to Piccadilly Circus for other Tube options. It's also a very easy walk to Buckingham Palace and St. James park.

All in all, we could not have asked for a better experience. It's fun, it's quirky, it's luxurious, it's friendly. We were very happy and would absolutely stay there again. We didn't bring the kids this time but I would be OK doing that as well.",5,2018,04,23
145,Excellent stay at the Trafalgar St. James!,"Spent a wonderful week at the Trafalgar St. James!  The location could not be more central, and it was amazing to walk outside and right into Trafalgar Square each morning.  The hotel is an easy walk to many of the major sites in London, and there are tube and bus stops just outside as well. As a gold member, was upgraded to a King room which was quite large for London and very comfortable for a longer stay.  The bed was very comfortable, bathroom nicely renovated, and noise (with the room facing the back of the hotel) was minimal.  Complimentary bottled water in the minibar was a nice bonus, and on several days they brought additional water for me during turn down service.  Quality of the food at breakfast was very good, and I very much appreciated that they had almond milk as an option with the cereals! Other nice bonuses- Molton Brown toiletries, USB ports to charge electronic devices, and complimentary wifi that worked really well (could FaceTime with family back home with no issues, which often is a problem in hotels).  The only issue I had was that they don't seem to answer the email address on their website- the last two nights of my stay were booked under separate reservation number and I tried to email the hotel several weeks in advance to ask them to link the reservations so I would not have to change rooms or check-in again, but I never received a response. The Front Desk was happy to help with that at check-in, though, so it worked out fine. Overall, a very enjoyable stay and would definitely recommend the hotel to others or stay here again!",5,2018,04,22
145,Stunning Hotel,"A lovely hotel in a fantastic location. We were a family of four staying in 3 rooms over a Saturday night. All rooms were ready for check in at midday. The hotel is beautifully furnished and rooms very comfortable with large walk in showers. It was so quiet considering it was on Trafalgar Square. The staff in the bar and restaurant at breakfast were outstanding offering an impeccable but friendly service. 
The roof top bar is amazing and it is essential to book on a sunny Saturday night. We will definitely make the Trafalgar St James our number one choice for our frequent trips to London.",5,2018,04,22
145,Wonderful stay!!!!,"From the moment I walked into the hotel, everyone was just fantastic. The staff are really nice and polite, engaging in a sincere conversation. As a gold member, I got an upgrade to a family room which was very clean and smelled so good! It was my anniversary with my boyfriend, so they arranged some amenities for our room. After we checked in, room service came 3 times bringing chocolates, cakes and wine, which made our stay unforgettable. Also the rooftop bar has an amazing view of Trafalgar square and London Eye, making it even more enjoyable. The breakfast was also very healthy and properly cooked. Very happy with our stay, we will definitely come back. ",5,2018,04,22
145,Would definitely return!,"Excellent hotel with impeccable amenities. Front desk, concierge, and bell staff are all amazing.

145,Friends birthday Drinks ,"We had a private room which was nice as we had our own waitress. Great views of London, nice vibe to the place, blankets provided if requested.

It’s a great place to go for either an hour or 5. 

All staff were really great from the moment you walk in.

145,Great location and great accommodations!," The hotel was very nice and clean and in a perfect location.

I have nothing but positive things to say about this property.  I hope to be back.  ",5,2018,04,12
145,Fantastic stay,"I just spent 2 nights at this hotel and it was fantastic.  We’d booked the lowest tier room, and then a few days before I received an email saying that I could request an upgrade for a discounted fee.  We did this, and were upgraded to the next tier room for an extra £21 per night.  Such a good decision.  I don’t know what the other rooms in the hotel are like but our room felt like it was the best room in the hotel! It was on the 3rd floor, a corner room.  I could quite literally see Nelson’s column from the bed! Our room basically looked out across Trafalgar Square.  It was a great size room, large comfy bed but very uncomfortable pillows.  Huge bathroom, really good shower.  We could use the minibar for free but there was no alcohol in it.  There was a small carton of milk for making tea or coffee (in a Nespresso machine!) plus some coke, Diet Coke, water, and even 2 small bars of dark chocolate!

The location of this hotel is amazing.  You step out the door and you’re in Trafalgar Square. Minutes away from everything.  

The staff were brilliant, very efficient and friendly upon check in.  The receptionist even escorted us up to our room herself.

We only had breakfast one morning, and it was nice.  We were advised to book it at reception rather than just turn up at the restaurant.  If you book it through reception the buffet breakfast costs £10 as opposed to £20 if you just turn up.  I did find this a bit strange.  If you wanted something off the A La Carte it was an extra £7.  We both had pancakes off the menu.  These were possibly the best pancakes I’d ever eaten.  Light, fluffy, very filling, and with the perfect amount of maple syrup (most places I find only give you a tiny drizzle which doesn’t go very far).  With crispy bacon.  Yum.  I was a bit disappointed with the buffet, not a huge amount of choice.  Not compared with other Hilton’s I’ve stayed at.  I’m assuming you could get toast but I didn’t see this.  There was a small selection of full size muffins, meat and cheese, pastries, some delicious fresh fruit and a few different types of yoghurt.  3 different types of juice, and we had tea and coffee.

We did visit the rooftop bar but was disappointed to be seated in an inside area with no view when we were hoping to soak up the atmosphere outside.  We didn’t actually stay to order a drink because when we looked at the menu and saw that the cocktails were around £18 we figured we’d go somewhere else.

These issues weren’t enough to make me deduct a point however.

All in all a fabulous stay and I would definitely go back (if I could afford it 😜)",5,2018,04,10
145,Perfect spot for your London stay,"Great Location in the heart of Trafalgar Square.  Walk to Westminster, London Eye and Buckingham palace, short bus ride to St Paul's Cathedral. Easy transportation options.  Beautiful hotel with the most helpful, friendliest staff of any hotel I have stayed at.",5,2018,04,09
145,Loved this hotel!,"What a great experience!  This hotel is a tasteful mix of old and new, historic and modern.  Our one-night stay -- which was booked on points -- was wonderful.

The room was lovely, spacious, and quiet.  We were offered an upgrade due to my Diamond status.  I loved the nice amenities, especially the Nespresso machine.  They also sent us a complimentary dessert to celebrate our anniversary.

The staff was perfectly nice and warm.  They were helpful and efficient.  Our room was not ready upon arrival, but they were happy to take our bags and let us know when it was good to go.

The breakfast buffet was OK, but I would not have paid for it; continental was included with my Diamond status.  My wife's Diet Coke cost $4, which was frustrating but -- I guess -- expected.  

The location was wonderful and very walkable!  I highly recommend this hotel!",5,2018,04,09
145,Great hotel at great location,"The hotel is great, good customer service, good food and comfortable rooms. The location is even better, you could spend several days just walking around... It's in Tafalgar Square, so you could walk to Picadilly, China Town, Oxford St, Regent St, Buckingham Palace, Big Ben and Hyde Park in a few minutes. There is also a metro station very close to the hotel.",5,2018,04,09
145,"Great location, staff and rooms.","Stayed here over St Patrick's Weekend.
The staff were all friendly and helpful.  The room was lovely.  
Lunch in the restaurant was extremely good and the staff also seated us so that we could watch the St Patrick's Day parade which passed by right outside.  The warm atmosphere here definitely offset the cold snowy day outside.

Would recommend.",5,2018,04,04
145,What an amazing place to stay in London,"I stayed here on business recently and was thoroughly impressed.  The rooms are very nice, comfortable and quiet.  Some great touches, such as the fact that you can use anything from the mini-bar, which comprises soft drinks, water, milk and very yummy Montezuma chocolate.  The bathroom has a selection of Molton Brown toiletries.

Breakfast is relaxed as you order from a menu with excellent choice (I highly recommend the eggs benedict) and the attention from the staff is absolutely spot on.

Its location is brilliant, facing right onto Trafalgar Square. Very handy for many attractions and sights, the tube and buses.

My only disappointment is that I wasn’t there to make any use of the rooftop bar (it was snowing) and therefore I only have one option and that is to return in the summer!

This hotel is up there with the very best (maybe even THE best) I have stayed in London and will definitely look to return more often.",5,2018,04,04
145,outstanding hotel,"I have been here recently with my husband and we had a very pleasant stay. Very central , in one step you are directly on the Trafalgar Square and it takes only one minute to the tube station charing cross.The staff is very friendly and helpful.When we arrived the porter immediately asked if he can help us with the luggage. The suite was amazing, large, stylishly furnished and had a direct view to the Trafalgar Square. The windows are isolated very well, we heard nothing from the noise outside. We were eating several times at the bar and in the restaurant.The quality of the food and drinks is amazing (you must try the pulled lamb burger or the puy lentil moussaka!)  and the staff was also very attentive and nice. The breakfast buffet is ok, you get everything you need. Additional we selected the grilled halloumi and the scottish smoked haddock, which was very tasty.
Whenever we needed service, the reception, the concierge or the housekeeping promptly answered our wishes. The guest service is amazing and we felt in very good hands- this is the main reason what made this stay so special.
This hotel is outstanding and I can only recommend to stay and eat here whenever you are in London!",5,2018,04,03
145,Wonderful Hoel,"This hotel is in such a wonderful location.  You can walk to just about every where.  The staff is excellent and the rooms are very, very comfortable.  Very spacious, beds are luxurious, 4 pillows.  Complimentary mini bar with water and soft drinks.  Great espresso machine for a quick cup of coffee in the a.m. Huge tv screens, big bathrooms.  Right next door to Charing Cross underground.",5,2018,04,02
145,Great location,"Stayed for 2.nights, ok at checkin but on arriving at hotel and tried to enter correct hotel entrance doors sign says use doors to right, how are we to know to enter via dining room doors ? Room is very good, no real view out window as they are tiny. Location is fantastic and within walking distance of many attractions. Breakfast is good when it is not busy but they struggled when it got busy on Sunday morning. We would stay again for the location, but the price is up there.",4,2018,04,02
145,Business trip with a great hotel,"My company had a business meeting and they chose this hotel.  Conveniently located in London, easy to walk to about anything. Right across the street from Trafalgar Square.  Staff was very helpful and eager to help.  I would stay again",5,2018,03,28
145,Wish I had chosen the other hotel.,"Stayed at the Trafalgar St. James for 4 nights recently. I would clearly give this hotel a solid 3 stars, not 5. I was quite disappointed with the room size, amenities, and customer service.

I booked through Hilton and am a Gold member. I called after booking to make sure of my Gold perks so I would know what to expect. A room upgrade if available, breakfast for 2, and 2 bottles of water.

Let’s start with the arrival. No one greeted me at the door, nor offered to open it. I was juggling a large suitcase and purse after an overnight flight from the US. There is a button on the side of the entrance door that staff will just watch you push and not attempt to help. This was a theme, as there was never anyone to offer a hello, have a good day or may I be of assistance. The front desk staff was not very welcoming. No thank you for being a Hilton honors member. No here is a little about our hotel. When I asked about the upgrade, it was simply here is your room. No you have been upgraded, which I am pretty sure I was not. I asked about the breakfast and was told it was in the bar area and the times. The end, nothing more – very curt. I was directed to the elevators, no helping with bags, etc. It’s in the tourist area, so expect quite a ride from Heathrow. The location was great and the tube was super conveniently located. On Sunday, there was a St. Patricks Day parade, so the area was roped off. We did not hear anything about this from the hotel, and it would have been good to know as my taxi/Uber could not collect us.

The included breakfast is continental. Apparently, if you want eggs or an item from the menu, it is an additional 7 pounds. Seriously, why not just include one menu item since the continental is listed at 20 pounds. Needless to say, you get pretty fatigued eating the same thing every day. 

There is also a tablet in the room for your use, but it is not very useful as you cannot go back when viewing a website, but you can certainly get to all things Trafalgar St. James at a moments notice. Interestingly, the tablet turns on and becomes bright at random times in the morning. And, do not use it to set an alarm for waking up—it will not do anything or alert.

The included mini bar consisted of 2 bottles of still water, 2 bottles of sparkling, 2 regular cokes, 2 diet cokes, 1 bottle of orange juice, 1 small bottle of milk, and 2 extra dark bars of chocolate (not a fan). The Nepresso was nice, but I didn’t use it. I did use the kettle to make tea and burned my hand as it gets boiling hot and has a small handle that does not lend itself for pouring without a towel or something to protect from burns.

The bathroom is small and storage is non-existent. I am not sure why the toilet brush needs to be left in the bathroom, seems unsanitary in a hotel. It appears the rooms were renovated at some time as the original closets are still in the room and locked, so space is wasted, and it makes for a strange configuration. The new wardrobes are also small, so hopefully you’re not there for a long visit. The shower is also quite small. The room itself has two very uncomfortable chairs and a small round table in the seating area, which has two steps leading to it. It makes the room sound big, but trust me it is not. It was easier to use the bed as a place to read and have tea as the 2 steps that lead to the seating area is odd and can be a tripping hazard if you are not properly oriented and aware. We tripped a couple of times on this odd configuration. The décor that you see on the website  for your room is over your bed, and nothing more. The windows do not open and you wish they did. I did not care for the smell of the room and the exterior hallway. 

I come to London every few months to visit my daughter who lives there and this was my first visit to the St. James. I considered this one and another hotel and we wished every second we were at the other. Sadly, I would not recommend.
",3,2018,03,27
145,Stay here!,"Excellent experience from the location and staff to the clean, large room to the top-quality breakfast. Loved our time here. We will definitely stay here again the next time we visit London -- for business or for pleasure.",5,2018,03,25
145,Fantastic new central London hotel.,"Had a 1 night stay in London & chose The Trafalgar St James. Great new hotel & perfect location for Soho, Covent Garden, theatres etc. The rooms were beautifully decorated with all mod-cons & great little touches; beautiful bathrooms, Nespresso machine,  free mini-bar (no alcohol), plenty of USB/plug sockets, crisp bedding, fluffy towels, iPad for all your hotel information & to order room service. The rooftop bar was also amazing & stunning views. Only gripe was not enough gluten-free options on the menu & no GF bread. Fab hotel though & will be back. ",5,2018,03,25
145,"Outstanding, Amazing, Perfect!","We had two wonderful nights and I would give even more points on TripAdvisor if possible.
The location is more than perfect to discover the main attractions of London. Even the hotel is directly located at the Trafalgar Square the rooms are extremely good isolated and you do hear nothing from the trouble of the square. 
When we arrived we were warmly welcomed and the check-in was personally, professional and fast. We received a free upgrade to the Trafalgar Suite. 
The Suite was large (39 sqm), modern & clean; advantage minibar is included in this roomtype. The king-size bed is extraordinary comfortable. We had a relaxing sleep. Bad amenities are having a fine quality and you do have everything you need.
Breakfast in the morning is very tasty and the warm dishes to order are exceptional good. Try the Smoked Haddock, it made my day!
We had twice dinner and the served food was mouth-watering for a good  price. The steak was outstanding and one of the bests I ever had!
The biggest strength is the extremely amicable staff. Everybody is smiling, attentive and very polite. 
We can more than recommend to stay at the Travalgar St. James; if you come to London book it !",5,2018,03,24
145,Character and charm!,"The Trafalgar St. James is a very special property, with a great deal amount of charm and style. We loved the endless minibar, the artwork surrounding us, and the perfect location for touring London. Would be a great choice for a couples trip!",5,2018,03,24
145,"Lovely Hotel, Great Atmosphere","Came here for the Dave Hogan photography exhibition. Exhibition was fantastic with lovely photos used throughout the hotel. the Hogan Signature cocktails were fantastic. The Hotel restaurant was lovely. Given it was 10pm food took a long time with lack of waiters to ask for an update, however it was worth the wait as food was gorgeous.",5,2018,03,22
145,What a gem !,"Brilliant location, newly refurbished hotel. Staff first class, rooms very nicely decorated.
Nice touch having complimentary non-alcoholic mini-bar, magazines and ipad style tablet in the room.
Triple glazing meant we heard no traffic. 6th floor rooftop bar offered brilliant London Skyline.",5,2018,03,18

Excellent service, friendly & accommodating staff, gorgeous rooftop bar with stunning views & a great breakfast selection.",5,2018,03,17
145,Will be back,"Due to a scheduling error I had to spend an extra night in London, and chose to stay here.  The location was excellent, close enough to the shopping districts around Piccadilly but just outside the concentrated tourist section.  The room was very comfortable and quiet, and I cannot fault the staff.  I was actually quite ill at the time and they were incredibly accomodating, offering warm lemon water with honey without prompting.  I have nothing but good words to say about this hotel and the staff, will definitely be staying here again if I get a chance. ",5,2018,03,14
145,Fabulous,"Fabulous place!! Wonderful staff and awesome location! Great rooftop bar.  The staff made certain all of my needs were addressed and taken care of.  The location is perfect, easy to get to everything from your front dooor!",5,2018,03,10
145,Love this hotel!,"I have been twice now in three months and absolutely love this hotel. It has a great vibe, the staff are attentive and the decor is luxe! If you are looking for a hotel close to all the attractions of London with a laid back, relaxed feel this is perfect. The rooms are the stylish and elegant and the whole experience will make you feel great!",5,2018,03,10
145,What a fantastic hotel!,"We have stayed in this beautifully renovated hotel back in February 2018. We booked a family room for 3 people with breakfast. I have seen some very good reviews on different websites, but I was not expecting that. There are no words how to explain this hotel. From the arrival until our departure we were treated like royalties.
This stay was also a small treat to our little one who had a birthday on the previous day. The room was decorated with birthday balloons, cakes, amenities and a birthday card which was signed from all the employees. We have never received such a care and we were not expecting that at all. Massive well done to the Guest Relations Manager, Oliver.
The room was spotless, super clean and fresh. Super comfortable beds, amazing bathroom and all the small touches what you really need during your stay. Fluffy bathrobes, Nespresso machine with loads of capsules and complimentary minibar what they replenish on a daily basis.
We were a bit tired after our long trip, so we decided to order room service. We ordered the burger and we had some special request for our kid and they made it for him without any hesitation. That burger was my best in my life. Very fresh, tasty and such a quick and polite service. On top of that when they delivered the food they brought another birthday cake and the room service lady was singing happy birthday. Oh, such a moment.
Next day we had breakfast in the restaurant. We went for the English breakfast, which was fresh and tasty. The buffet was looking really good, nice and fresh pastries, cereals and so many other things. The service during the breakfast was quick and efficient.
All in all we had an amazing time in this hotel and I think we have found our new favourite hotel in London. Well done to the Management Team and all the staff members. They created such a memorable stay for all of us. Thank you very much for that. We will be back soon.",5,2018,03,08
145,Perfect in Every Way,"I travel to London for business about once every six weeks and have stayed in many different hotels throughout the city over the last several years The Trafalgar St. James London is my new favorite hotel, and will be the only place I stay from here on out. The accommodations are fabulous. The location is ideal. The service is attentive and on point. From top to bottom, this hotel is perfect.",5,2018,03,07
145,One of the nicest hotels I have stayed in.,"A new addition to the curio collection by Hilton. This high end remodel is in an excellent location opposite Trafalgar Square. The room we had was clearly brand new with high end furnishing, tablet control of things, and a bathroom with both a large shower and a large soaker tub. Coffee machine and a selection of snacks was provided. After asking they bought more decaf as we like it.
Bed was large and comfortable and a large window looking over the street.
Breakfast was excellent - buffet style, though they would make things too - all served downstairs where you have a nice view of the square.
Great location, great quality and staff bent over backwards to be helpful and make sure we had all that we wanted.
They have a roof garden which was being refurbished when we went. Would love to see the view from there.
This is my new go to place in London!!",5,2018,03,05
145,Impromptu mini break in London,"With all kids activities cancelled over the weekend due to snow, we decided to get out of the country and in to the city for the night.  Having heard that the Trafalgar had undergone a refurbishment, we book a room with 2 queen size beds, and set off.  Arriving in London we went straight to the theatre ticket booth in Leicester Square and were able to get tickets for 42nd Street.  We then headed to the hotel, and were not disappointed.  The refurbishment has transformed the look and feel of the hotel.  The welcome was very warm and genuine, and the standards were impeccable.  Breakfast had to be one of the best breakfasts we have had.  The buffet has every thing you want, then on top of that a huge menu of cooked items (great poached eggs!).  We will be back.  Thanks",5,2018,03,05
145,Amazing,Stayed here twice in 2017. The central location is amazing and really useful for getting around Central London. The hotel staff are really helpful and attentive. Rooms are exceptional and perhaps some of the best I've stayed in. I would thoroughly recommend. ,5,2018,03,05
145,this is it now for us!!!,"what a great place, just had a refurb and its top notch, we stop all over in all sorts of places and this is one of the best, the staff were amazing with there can do attitude and caring comments we will be staying here again. The rooms were top notch king bed a nd all the facilities in room you would need and right in Trafalgar square, but you would not know it, the food was excellent and plenty of it.so well done from the top down you did a great job and thank you.BC",5,2018,03,05
145,Perfect stay right in the middle of London ,"I must share this perfect stay in the trafalgar st James.Only 1 night but enough to tell, right in the middle of London everything around is open late and very convenient.
From the welcome at the reception(Spanish guy really nice don’t remember his name)  where we were take to our kindly upgraded room (when they can it’s very appréciable I must say) until our check out.
Modern room with singular furniture, bed very good, shower and bath at least both choice ! Calm corridor and hotel even if you are in the busy area of Trafalgar Square.
The must I loved is when you are coming back late , bed is open, room warm as necessary, subdued light and little treat waiting for you.
That’s a service I expect in a boutique 4/5* hotel.
Breakfast at the bar/restaurant, large choice and very good !
Go for it ! :-) 
",5,2018,03,03
145,Love this hotel! ,"This hotel went above and beyond our wishes! We were there to celebrate my mom and husband’s birthdays. We love, love, loved our time here and really appreciated the kind and responsive staff. We needed special milk and juice on demand for our toddler and they saved the day with providing these drinks at the lobby bar, room service and our mini bar. Location is exceptional. The transport to the airport was wonderful. We really liked the concierge who helped us book the transport with toddler car seat. Such lovely employees and hotel. We will be back. ",5,2018,03,02
145,Exceeded my Expectations in Every Way,"I just returned from a four nights' stay at The Trafalgar St. James with my family, and could not have been more pleased.  The hotel is conveniently located between Trafalgar Square and St. James Park.  The property has been completely renovated - the lobby, the rooms, the restaurant, the rooftop -- all gorgeous and brand new.  The staff are very, very friendly and accommodating.  We could not have asked for a better experience.",5,2018,03,01
145,What a welcome,"What a welcome - from the minute we set foot inside the door we were looked after so well.  All the staff were smiling & friendly & nothing was too much trouble. Our rooms were smart,comfortable with all the amenities one could ever ask for. The hotel was right in the heart of London so my camera was clicking away every minute. The tube station was only a short walk away so we could travel to other parts of London easily. The food was delicious & varied & all requests were catered for with a smile.",5,2018,03,01
145,So much better after the relaunch,"I've recently stayed in the hotel for the second time - the first since the revamp of the hotel.

The building itself has always been a grand old building full of history and the location is a superb as ever but it was the inside that impressed me the most.

I believe there is no better situated hotel in the whole of London if you want to be central. You're a short walk from the West End, can wander to the South Bank, Buckingham Palace, Westminster Palace or Seven Dials.

The rooms were very well appointed and I liked the decor (we had a picture of Mick Jagger gazing down at us), the bed was large and comfy and I was a big fan of the small mezzanine floor in the room which made that seating area feel separate.

We ate a lunch at the Trafalgar Dining Rooms and the food was very nice. One evening we went up to The Rooftop bar and what a view! Definitely right up there with the best rooftop views in the city. The bar was low lit and reasonably romantic... it's our fault for going there in the winter that detracted from the experience. The cocktails were mixed properly; so many places just bang them together but my Espresso Martini was sublime.

I know this part of London i spoilt for hotels but I dont think you should look any further than The Trafalgar St James. The staff were all very good, the rooms were great and all food and drink - from both outlets - was excellent. This together with the location mean we'd definitely come back here next time we wanted to stay in central London.",5,2018,03,01
145,Great boutique feel with top Hilton standards,"This is a new, boutique-style hotel in the heart of London but hidden away. The room I had was homely and spacious with great facilities (coffee machine, mini bar, tablet with hotel directory, etc) and the bathroom was HUGE with a separate shower and bathtub. 

Service was great with all staff being extremely friendly and the hotel being spotless. The hotel management went out of their way to ensure I had a memorable and pleasant stay.

I ordered an expensive steak from room service (around £40) but it was high quality and one of the best I’ve ever had! Breakfast was strange in that there is no buffet (other than cereals and some cheese and cakes and pastries) but you order a dish from the menu. I suppose this reflects the low price which I think was £10 (compared to £25 at other Hilton hotels in London).

I’d definitely stay here again. It was nice and quiet and had such a warm, homely feel which is especially nice when away on business!",5,2018,02,28
145,"Superb hotel, superb location, superb staff......","Ive just returned from a two nigh stay at the hotel. What can I say. I did a bit of research before we booked, and the reviews for this hotel, stood out a mile. I can honestly say that its better than I ever expected. The hotel is in a prime location, just off Trafalgar Square, and of you are lucky enough to get a room overlooking the Square, the view is gorgeous.. Rooms are boutique style chic, and are very modern and stylish. The staff are very welcoming, and everyone was cheery, and helpful. There is a rooftop garden, but at -3c, we decided it was far too cold. On a warm evening, this would be a great place to have a drink though, as the view over looking London is breathtaking. Hotel is a credit to the owners, and the staff are a credit to the manager. I will be booking in again for a break in the summer, without hesitation,",5,2018,02,28
145,Great stay for our Anniversary,"Really enjoyed our stay at this hotel! We went for our anniversary and loved it, service was great in all areas, all round fantastic service! I would definitely recommend the rooftop bar which was *surprisingly* reasonably price for location and VIP feel. Hope to go back soon.",5,2018,02,27
145,Excellent place to stay in the heart of London with kids,"We traveled to Europe for our first time with our 2 kids and was staying with family in Paris.  As a quick getaway, we decided to spend 2 nights in London, and after researching a number of hotels, we decided on the St. James.   This place was amazing for a number of reasons - the location ( we walked to Buckingham, the London Eye, Big Ben.. with a 15 and 10-year-old in tow), the National Gallery is literally right beside you, as is the Canadian Embassy ( we happen to be Canadian).  The rooms are spacious and remind me of something we would have at home, and the free mini bar in your room ( re-stocked daily with water, pop, milk, and OJ, non-alcoholic) was perfect.   There is also a Nespresso machine in your room with pods, as are nice wine glasses and coffee cups.   The staff was so helpful - but not in a 'I want a big tip way' - they were just super helpful and accommodating...Also, don't miss out on the rooftop bar - the views are amazing!  As first-time travelers to London, this couldn't have been a better place to stay. 

As a tip, but nothing to do with this hotel specifically, was that my husband and I found the kitchens in bars in the area close early, so if you are going out for a drink and appie later, make sure you go before 9 pm. Otherwise, you have to hit up McDonald's if you want to eat. :)",5,2018,02,27
145,Excellent Room & Location,"Pros:

Excellent Room. Very Well-Styled & Bathrooms looked chic.
Location is right beside Trafalgar Square
Near Tube
Near Cafes & Restaurants
Mini Bar Goodies were free and were refilled daily.

Cons:

Breakfast buffet had the most limited selection compared to any 4* or 5* I've experienced. Ate only ONCE during our 8 day stay, and selections never changed.

Ate dinner at the restaurant, and the steak I ordered was served close to well done, as opposed to medium rare, and tasted bland. But the waiter was excellent!

Definitely would stay again, especially if rates are reasonable. Hopefully they would fix the buffet spread!",5,2018,02,25
145,At the top of my list for central London!,"This is a wonderful hotel.  And you will see from the other reviews that the location is amazing and depending on your room, the view is great.   My room was clean and well appointed.  Mini bar water and soft drinks were complimentary.  Wifi was good.  And possibly my favorite feature was that you can walk out the door and begin your run on the Mall.  This might not seem like a big deal, but as my fellow runners can attest, it can be a pain to walk/run through the city to get to a park.  From the St James, you can run over to Hyde Park and easily get in a 6 mile loop.  So nice!  So, why am I holding back a 5th star?  When I checked out, because of the ""system"" being down they were unable to take my payment and provide me with an invoice.  However, they assured me they would do this and e-mail it to me later in the day.  This never occurred and I had to contact them to get my invoice for my expense report.  This mistake, coupled with a dirty teaspoon and not replenishing the shampoo/conditioner each day, kept me from giving them a full 5 stars.  However, I will gladly stay here again.",4,2018,02,23
145,Incredible Stay,"We stayed to celebrate New Year and it was everything we hoped for and more! 
From the moment we arrived the staff, every single one we met, were welcoming, friendly and couldn’t do enough for us. 
Our room was lovely and spacious. The bed super comfy and an absolute treat to have a hairdryer with power next to a mirror. Such a simple thing but often forgotten in hotels. 
The Rooftop was incredible! The view of the fireworks was breathtaking. The food lovely and plenty of champagne. A perfect night. 
",5,2018,02,23
145,The wow factor hotel of London ,"Choose this hotel as the location was perfect, We were not disappointed with this lovely new hotel . It had the wow factor of a view . The plush entrance reception area with smart attentive staff could not do more for us. The room we had was a front view over looking the Trafalgar Square it was amazing . Nice comfy bed and the ensuite rain shower it was truly sublime.
The roof top bar is a must great exciting fresh cocktails and food . It’s not often I’m impressed enough in a hotel to complete a review 
We will be back ",5,2018,02,22
145,"High-End, Sophisticated Luxury in a Super-Central Location","This is a great hidden secret of Central London.  Location wise you cannot really be anymore central, with everything literally a strones-throw away.

The service is wonderful and not intrusive. The decor and ambiance make for a great stay and/or meal.

The restaurant is really nice, solid menu offering a wide range of mostly Greek food.  The wine list is extensive, with the 2011 Rioja being a personal favourite - although for beer drinkers, the Curious Brew is really nice.

If you venture up to the rooftop then on a clear day, you can see for miles it really is spectacular.  

I would totally recommend anyone to stay here or at the very least visit for some drinks.  Go in, relax and indulge in the delights away from the hustle and bustle of Central London.",5,2018,02,22
145,Outstanding customer service,"Stayed here with my husband for one night to celebrate my birthday.
On arrival we were told that our room had been upgraded and that we were being left complimentary soft drinks.
Our room was beautiful, spotlessly clean with the most amazing view of Trafalgar Square. 
The bed was so huge, it could have fit about 4 people in it!!
The complimentary drinks we’d been left turned out to be a whole mini bar of different soft drinks plus chocolate.
After a few minutes. We had a knock on the door and I was presented with a chocolate mousse saying happy birthday and a card from the manager.
After we’d returned from our outing to the theatre, we had received a turn down service and left more bottles of water. 
The enormous bed was very comfortable and to say we were in such a central location, the windows must have been bullet proof as we never heard a thing from outside. 
I would like to say a huge thank you to all the staff working on the 13th Feb. Your customer service is outstanding.
I would have no trouble recommending this hotel to anyone. ",5,2018,02,22
145,Outstanding!,"Brilliant location - at the corner of Trafalgar Square and The Mall - walking distance to all the top central sights.  A couple of minutes walk to Charring Cross underground station.  Beautifully renovated rooms with very effective glazing, which keeps the traffic noise out.  Wonderful staff, who went out of their way to make our stay enjoyable.  Great restaurant and special thanks to Gennaro, our waiter, for the super service.  The Rooftop bar is very cool with super views and the food was outstanding.  One of the best hotel experiences we’ve had in recent years - thoroughly recommended.",5,2018,02,21
145,Surely the best views in London?,"We visited to view Dave Hogan’s Exhibition of work which is being auctioned off for charity next week and were so pleased to discover this lovely Hotel.
The photographs were amazing, some real history there, all the staff could not have been more lovely advising us on where to go to view and allowing us to look downstairs at more work that was in a private room as not occupied at the time. 
We finished off this lovely experience by going up to the roof garden for a light lunch and cocktails. Wow what a great experience, we were so lucky with the weather, clear sunny and bright. The views are stunning together with the lovely food and fabulous cocktails we spent a small fortune but it was worth every penny.
So much so we are booking a weekend away here in the autumn.",5,2018,02,21
145,Unbelievably Excellent! Superb Location!,"Rarely do I extend those little green circles out to the 'excellent' level, but the Trafalgar St. James is absolutely worthy! Excellent customer service makes all the difference, and Guest Relations Manager, Oliver Darrington, dishes it out in spades! Oliver and his team know how to make sure their guests are happy. 

The rooms are well appointed and tastefully decorated. Sheets were crisp and duvets fluffy and full. Bath towels were large and new. Lighting in the bathroom was complimentary and the bath was a wonderful, comfortable size. I loved the small touches such as a complimentary minibar full of soft drinks (with both still and sparkling water and milk for coffee, as well as orange juice, coke, diet coke and a couple of other options). The individual Nespresso machine meant a great cuppa before breakfast (and more excellent coffee, in case you didn't get the message the first time!) All surfaces in the room had been meticulously checked and were clean. I loved the cloth bags for laundry rather than the usual plastic and plenty of room for storing clothes. 

While we were staying, we had the pleasure of viewing Dave Hogan's iconic portfolio, which certainly added to the hotel's ambiance. How wonderful it would be if these amazing images could remain in situ! Let's hope they keep up with comparable exhibitions throughout the year! The Roof Top Bar was wonderful and one did not mind paying a little more per cocktail to experience the view. 

Most of all, I appreciated the option to add breakfast each morning if we felt like it. Normally the option is offered at the beginning of a stay and the decision needs to be made for the full stay or not at all. I loved the flexibility. Breakfast was exceptional and the coffee alone made it worth the money (save 50% on breakfast price if you add it to your room). On our last morning, the hotel was short staffed and they managed the morning with exceptional agility. 

Another guest remarked upon the lack of noise - I would absolutely agree. We looked out on Trafalgar Sq but heard next to nothing thanks to the double glazed windows. This hotel is all about location but gives up nothing when it comes to quality and service. I have stayed in many hotels in London, and none have impressed me quite like this. Thank you to all the amazing team members at the Trafalgar St. James!",5,2018,02,20
145,Totally Awesome!,"What an absolutely amazing find!  You book a hotel called The Trafalgar in London but you never expect to get a room actually overlooking Nelsons Column!  Excellent from start to finish.  I arrived early but was greeted at reception and told that I could book in and my bags would be held for me until my room was ready.  It was pouring with rain outside but an umbrella was found for me straight away so I could explore the local area.  When I arrived back I had the best room I could have wished for and the most exquisite mini pastries as a treat! The room was luxurious and the bed was to die for.  Even though I looked directly over Trafalgar Square the traffic noise did not bother me at all.  Before going out in the evening I booked in to the Rooftop Bar so that I could have a cocktail on my return.... this turned in to 4 with my friends but it was just amazing! Wonderful breakfast, full continental laid out in the bar area but with an option to order a full english.  All in all, an amazing stay in London for the night, it didn't feel like work at all!",5,2018,02,20
145,Surprisingly quiet in the heart of London,"This hotel was surprisingly quiet, despite being what must be the closest hotel to the (official) centre of London: the statue of Charles I in front of Trafalgar Square.

Rooms were spacious and clean. Staff were unfailingly friendly. Food was of a high standard. I would strongly advise for business or pleasure.",5,2018,02,19
145,Totally amazeballs :-),"What a wonderful find!  Excellent location, with underground parking below the hotel (QPark @ £39 for 24hrs).  Fabulous welcome, beautiful room, amazing cocktails, plentiful breakfast.  We will definitely be back.  Thank you :-)",5,2018,02,19
145,"Checked in for 1 night, checked out, then checked back in for a second!","I had booked this hotel for my partner and I for the Valentines weekend for 1 night, but ended up staying 2! 
On arriving at the hotel we made our way to reception, and I have to say they were such friendly staff who gave us an update on the refurb as I had stayed more than 5 years ago, and what a change! The whole layout on the ground floor was different, and had more of a buzz to it. 
Breakfast... Just WOW!!! The staff were attentive, food was incredible and nothing was too much trouble.
After checking out on Saturday we ended up inviting friends for lunch and a few cocktails (the DIB DAB was amazing), and after 3 plus rounds, decided to check back in with the additional room for our friends. I have to add that the bar staff were fantastic, they reconnected individual cocktails based on our tastes and were never waiting for a drink.  
Rooms - Very clean, modern, cosy and great views of the square. One thing I couldn't understand is why we didn't have a desk in the room? My partner spend an hour on laptop, but had to use the bed. I guessed that this hotel is more of a leisure hotel rather than a corporate, but we didn't mind. 
We will definitely be returning to this hotel, especially as we didn't make it to the rooftop. TIP: Pre-book a table on the rooftop as it gets very busy.",5,2018,02,19
145,Simply spectacular ,"Although nestled in one of the busiest parts of London, the newly refurbished Trafalgar St James provides a haven from the crowds.  The rooms are beautiful with special touches including a gorgeous diffuser, art work that links to the square and a shower that is simple to work!  The ground floor bar was cosy and my Espresso martini made to perfection.  To top it off, the staff are attentive and friendly.  This hotel is a real gem, I will be back!",5,2018,02,17
145,The Perfect Valentine's Day in a truly amazing Hotel,"I booked a night at The Trafalgar to treat my wife to Valentine's day and, oh boy! this was really an amazing experience.

From the arrival to the moment we left we were treated like Kings.

The staff was courteous and attentive. Always eager to help, but not too ""in your face"". The rooms very comfortable and spacious, with a view to die for, and dinner at the restaurant was the icing of the cake for a very special day.

The have as well a rooftop bar overlooking Trafalgar Square and you can even see the London Eye from there while having a cocktail.

Will definitely be back.",5,2018,02,17
145,"Amazing location, lovely room, but service needs improvement","The GOOD:
I stayed in the hotel for 4 nights early February. Booked a Queen room but was upgraded to a King room that included a mini bar with free soda, water, orange juice, milk and chocolate.
My welcome to the hotel was lovely, friendly and quick! location can't be any better!
The room was perfect, huge big bed, USB ports everywhere, Bluetooth speaker, tablet (would have been nice if the tablet controlled the room like at CitizenM), huge bath and shower.

The BAD:
After my first night I left the hotel in the morning to roam around the city, and when I got back to the hotel at 3pm I was very surprised to find out that the room wasn't made.
I was meaning to inform reception about that upon leaving the room again early evening when someone from the hotel knocked on my door and asked me whether the room was done or not. I guess the realized that they missed it. After telling them it wasn't made, and that I'll be away from the room by 5pm, I had the cleaning service getting into the room (without knocking) at half past 4pm while I was in the shower.
Coming back to the hotel that night, I saw that the room was done but the orange juice in the mini bar wasn't replenished. When asking the reception for the reason, I was answered that they were out of stock.
Next day, gone out of the room again, got back, room was made, mini bar wasn't replenished at all and was missing all the items I consumed earlier.
Asked for reception for a replenishment while out, got back, still no orange juice, and this time also not chocolate.
During the rest of my stay the orange juice never came back, and chocolate did on the last day of my stay.
It may sound petty, but for a hotel in this caliber I would expect a very strict service routine and no shortage in supplies.
Moreover, I would have expected some sort of a formal apology in the sign of a personal note with a small treat after the incident on the first day. Missing a room clean is something that shouldn't happen in any hotel, especially a luxurious one as this.

Overall it's an amazing hotel and the location beats everything, but the service was lacking.",4,2018,02,16
145,Incredible service and attention to detail.,Went for sundowners at the roof top bar and it all felt very exclusive. What a spectacular transformation this place has had! Definitely a mainstay in my opinion. Will be visiting again soon! Luxury without any pompous stuffiness.,5,2018,02,15
145,Amazing location; great suites; fab food on the Rooftop,"We had a fab suite overlooking Trafalgar Square and spent New Year Eve on the Rooftop enjoying fabulous food, freeflowing drinks and the best view in town for the fireworks, at the Rooftop Bar. The suite was magnificent and very comfortable. Service from all the staff was impeccable and it was great to see the the GM Joanne and her deputy Elodie as visible presences on the ground, ensuring we all had what we needed for a great stay. Kudos ladies to you and your team!
 ",5,2018,02,14
145,Best hotel in London,"The newly renovated St. James Trafalger have certainly become one of the best hotels in London. The rooms are beautiful and clean, and the service by the staff at the hotel is simply second to none. Very happy customer! ",5,2018,02,14
145,Quality hotel in top location ,"Having stayed at the Doubletree Hilton Westminster many times over the past 15 years, we fancied changing hotels to something a little more upmarket. This hotel certainly fulfilled that brief very well indeed.

Overall, the building has been refurbished to a high standard and whereas so often this modern chic style can fall short on quality of finish, The Trafalgar doesn’t fall into this trap. Fixture and fittings throughout are high end and the whole place feels suitably luxurious. We had a Nelson Double Queen room (305) which was a comfortable size for two adults and two small children sharing. The room looked out over Trafalgar Square however, due to some good glazing, noise is not an issue. Plus staying in this location it would be odd not to experience the city in full. 

By far the best outcome of choosing the hotel was location. Within minutes you can walk to numerous sights and shopping areas without needing taxis or tubes or tiring yourself out just getting there! You are literally on the doorstep of loads of great places. 

The staff at the hotel are generally very welcoming and efficient. Nothing feels too much effort. 

However, the one area we felt slightly disappointed by was the Dining Room restaurant. Prices are very high, which you would expect in this prime location. But unfortunately the evening meal we had didn’t meet expectations. We ate the lamb burger and calamari mains, and although the Malbec wine was very good, the food was just underwhelming. We were also served by a young waiter who, although extremely friendly, was perhaps just a bit too familiar and enjoyed the sound of his own voice. We did wonder whether the mediocre food could have been perhaps forgiven if the service had more finesse. Also, why no cheeseboard? On a more positive note, breakfast was very satisfying. 

Overall, I would highly recommend this hotel and we will certainly visit again in the future. ",4,2018,02,14
145,Winter Run 10k,"Amazing hospitality. Treated so well by all the staff. Room was great and what a bathroom. Great views of the square. Drinks and food in the rooftop bar. What a great space with even more stunning views. Food was amazing, chef couldn’t have done more for us. Would definitely love to go back.",5,2018,02,14
145,One magical night in this amazing hotel.,"A suburb hotel on all fronts, location, room, staff and food. The roof top bar is a great place to see some of London. A lovely room with a view of one of London’s ironic sights.  The room was not small for a middle of the city hotel and the Nespresso machine is always welcomed.  We ate from the roof top bar menu and the steam buns are not to be missed. We will be back!",5,2018,02,14
145,Simply Stunning!,"What an amazing hotel!

I visited for dinner with friends whilst I was in London for the weekend.  We ate on the Rooftop, and between us, tasted most of the dishes on the menu!  The cocktails were to die for and if it's not on the drinks list, the skilled bartenders will be happy to make something specifically for you based on what your favourite tipple is. 

The view from the rooftop is one of the best in London but what really makes the place is the fantastic team, they really know what they are talking about and genuinely care about their guests.

We managed to get a sneaky peak round the bedrooms and I have to say that they are spectacular, especially the suite overlooking Trafalgar Square. Next time I'm looking for a hotel in central london to stay over I'll definitely be booking here!",5,2018,02,13
145,Outstanding! ,"Stayed here for a family visit to London & I have to say this was the best hotel we have ever stayed in. Everything was, as the title of this review says, Outstanding! High quality products, excellent hospitality from all of the team we came across & immaculately clean. An absolutely wonderful experience-We will be back! ",5,2018,02,13
145,"Cool decor, convenient location","We had an enjoyable Saturday night stay. Friendly reception on arrival with a helpful escort to the room. Nice ground floor bar with interesting cocktail list. Great location for the West End. Room was freshly refurbished with cool prints on the wall, comfy bed and slick bathroom. Stayed in 301 which has a nice view of Trafalgar Square (good if you're not bothered by City noise).",5,2018,02,09
145,Wow,"This hotel is one of the best I have ever stayed in.

The reception staff were helpful and the lobby and the bar area were very nice.

The room was lovely, so modern and a really good size. The bed was massive! So many nice little touches like books, magazines and art work everywhere.

The bathroom with a shower and large bath was also lovely! 

We ate at the rooftop restaurant in the undercover warmer part and the food was incredible. We ordered a fair few small dishes which were all incredible, bizarrely one of my favs was tempura broccoli. The prices aren't unreasonable either and you can't beat the views from the bar area.

We had an amazing nights sleep and breakfast the next day was so good! There are lots of options from fruit to granola and mini chocolate pains. You can then also order from the menu so I had poached eggs on toast.

Can not recommend this hotel highly enough. I didn't want to leave. Thank you for an amazing stay.",5,2018,02,08
145,Excellent Stay 01.02 - 04.02,"We had an excellent stay at The Trafalgar Hilton. Everything was exceptional from Front Office and Housekeeping to Food & Beverage (I would put more choices in the food menu and  larger dishes ;) )
Many thanks to Susanne (the room 219 who selected for us was great!) and the young Romanian gentleman who checked us in was really polite and professional, first class (sorry I did not check your name). 
There is only one thing which left me perplexed.. when I asked to the gentleman of the reception ""Hello sir, can I have a dental kit please, I am staying in room no. 219"" his answer was ""I am sure you are"". I did not get this answer at all. Apart from that 10/10.

Best Regards,

Niccolo",5,2018,02,08
145,Great hotel at a great location,"Loved the hotel. Location is great too.
Rooms are spacious and even the bathroom was good size. 
Close to train station and good restaurants. Staff is very friendly. All in all a great place. 
Would love to go back and stay there again.",5,2018,02,06
145,Classy,"From the moment we walked through the door until we left we cannot fault this lovely place. The staff were very friendly and helpful, we got there really early to leave our bags but we were able to check in there and then, aided by an excellent front desk lady. The room was just lovely, two very comfy doubles for hubby, me and 5 yr old and the bathroom was lush with a tub deep enough to swim in and a power shower. Room was spotless too. 

Breakfast was a classy affair. Service was good and food was equally good. 

Will definitely be coming back here. Not the cheapest but certainly worth it!! ",5,2018,02,04
145,Stayed there again,Introduced another friend to the Fox Club this week. He liked it. Great service at the bar and rooms were all ready when we arrived. They always make one feel welcome and the place was lovely and warm. ,4,2018,02,01
145,They are getting it right all round!,"Absolutely fabulous! I love The Trafalgar! This was the first time I stayed here and won’t be the last! You feel happy as soon as you walk in. The team is all smiles and all so ready to help and make you feel welcome. The people at the top seem like they got it right and are keeping their team happy, enthusiastic and motivated. Everyone is SO friendly. They clearly enjoy what they're doing. Well done guys. Keep it up! 

I loved everything about my room – décor, cool Tom Dixon accessories and coffee table books, lush Molton Brown toiletries, the view of Trafalgar Square, fresh milk in the free mini bar! It’s all in the detail! 

The food and service at the Trafalgar dining rooms and bar is tops. Really tasty and fresh. Needless to say, it was service with smiles all round. 
Really cannot fault anything! Thank you Trafalgar Team for making my stay such a great one. I cannot wait to be back next month!

145,"Nice Room, Great Location, Friendly Staffs","the room was beautifully designed, helpful staffs, check-in/out process was seamless and love the location where you are walking distance away from most of the attractions, shopping, food nearby. there's quite a few convenient store nearby too which comes in handy. ",5,2018,01,30
145,Lovely wedding anniversary visit,"Already thinking about our next visit ! Came across the Trafalgar and was drawn in by the rooftop bar, general look and oh yes the sale offer!! Despite a bit of a bumpy interaction to get a bottle of bubbly in the room on arrival (phone don't email) everything else was spot on - room upgrade so we could just about see Nelsons column, chocolate congratulations cake, rooftop bar and food was great, breakfast continental more than enough but didn't stop us having extras both days - haddock omelette especially good. My only niggle was that on both nights there were private functions in one of the bars delaying service and preventing access all areas - the staff looked after us but its just something for the hotel to remember they are a hotel and to always put the residents first. Looking forwards to coming back in the summer and testing out that rooftop bar again!",5,2018,01,29
145,One of the best hotels in London!,"Let me start by saying the location is excellent! The service is friendly and the rooms are refurbished and modern!
I stayed with my sister for 2 nights and we didn't even need to leave the hotel in the evenings since the rooftop bar is great during the weekend! Fantastic cocktails and fun music with a stunning view.
The only reason I'm not giving this hotel a 5 star is because of it's lack of a spa. I wanted a massage and could not get any. Even the number provided by the concierge for a massage in the room by an external party could not be reached. A five star hotel should have a spa or treatment room. Even if it's small.
Besides that: great hotel, great experience, will be back for sure!",4,2018,01,28
145,"Better still, following some remodeling","I’ve not stayed here for a little while so was pleasently surprised to find some great improvements. A brighter and roomier reception, a remodelling of the bar to create a much nicer space and a new and much improved breakfast experience. A redesign of the rooftop area is excellent making it now useable all year round and much proving the view. The room remain as good as ever, clean,  right, modern, and well equipped.",5,2018,01,28
145,Lovely Property,"We experienced extremely Friendly staff, and were welcomed very graciously throughout our stay. Presented by an elegant room key. The location of the hotel is superb we were able to walk everywhere we wanted to go during our stay and parking was right behind the hotel at a 20% off rate. Price seemed reasonable for the location. I started my rating at 5 stars for this location. We had one minor circumstance where we ordered some drinks to our room, and after an hour later we called to check the status only to find they had no order for us; the apologized and sent us complimentary drinks. I felt very valued for the way the staff handled this. Where I had to subtract two stars was from the rooms cleanliness. My first impression of the room was outstanding, did noticed however a dried urine stain on our seat in the bathroom upon arrival. (Have attached in the pictures below) and beneath our sheets of our bed we found crumbs throughout our whole bed. By the time we found the crumbs it may have been 2:00 AM too which we were in that kind of mode where it didn’t matter, we just slept on the other bed (double room). The next morning we notified the front desk and he didn’t offer an apology and guaranteed a thorough cleaning of the room for that evening. Second scenario is the door handle to our bathroom did come off after the first night, again let from desk know so a engineer was sent to the room for the repair; was fixed by the time we came in for the afternoon. I believe this property deserves a 3 star rating only because of the high standards I expected of the quality of the room.",3,2018,01,27
145,Weekend Break,"Beautiful decor quiet calm and plenty of attentive staff on arrival.  The room also what I expected from the website.  Chose because of its closeness to trafalgar square. The Rooftop bar looked good but decided against it because of the rain. Will definitely want to go there in the summer. One problem we encountered was in the bar. We sat and waited after being told it was waiter service.  However had a long wait. Once the order was taken we had another long wait. There were at least 5 staff and a couple of customers.  The drinks were very expensive which we expected but also expected better service.  Went to the pub next door for rest of our drinks 
Excellent stay otherwise",4,2018,01,22
145,Amazing!,"Cannot speak highly enough of the stay we had here!..right from the start the staff were friendly and helpful, Mike, the concierge, what brilliant, helped with everything without being overbearing, even arranged for a small birthday cake to be bought to our room for my girlfriend, really a pleasant surprise!
As for the room?..what else can I say?..absolutely spotless, everything was perfectly clean.
The rooftop bar is well worth visiting, all the staff here were amazingly attentive to our every need, highly recommended, and would come back anytime..thank you for an amazing stay.",5,2018,01,21
145,Les Miserables Theatre Trip,"My wife had always wanted to see Les Miserables at the theatre and as it has not come to our local theatres decided to take her to London to see it.As my daughter had stayed here previously she recommended this hotel and as part of our xmas present payed the cost of the accommodation.The hotel is next to Trafalgar square and could not fault anything about it the roof top terrace bar has great views over the city both during the day and night,and the beds in the rooms are the most comfortable we have ever slept in.",5,2018,01,21
145,Great location with a nice overall feel,"We chose this hotel for its central location which allowed us to reach many of London's main sites with just a short walk.  Our room was clean and modern with a view of Trafalgar square.  We were on the first floor (2nd floor in U.S) and heard almost no traffic at night, thanks to good sound proofed windows.  The staff was friendly and helpful.  There was an extensive continental breakfast (breads, pastries, cheeses, meats, fruits, cereal, granolas, juices) and also a hot menu. We were a family with two teenagers there for sightseeing and the overall feel of the hotel seemed just right for us...not too formal or stodgy, not too business, not too hip.  My one area for improvement would be that the room always seemed a bit stuffy when first walking back in at the end of the day, though after a few minutes I didn't notice.  It would be nice if the windows could at least be opened partially to allow some fresh air in.  In sum, a very nice hotel that I would return too.",5,2018,01,20
145,Delightful Stay in a Great Location,"Very impressed with the attentive service and professionalism of the staff. Great location, attractive and comfortable room, and tasty meals in an elegant setting. It was a wonderful stay and I'm looking forward to returning. Couldn't recommend highly enough. Kudos to Front of House Manager Miklos Jocskov for a first-class operation.",5,2018,01,20
145,Gold member major let down,"We arrived as gold loyalty members , we walked into the hotel and proceeded straight forward to a small desk and an Irish girl was writing behind the desk we stood and were completely ignored for at least 5 mins until my son said “ excuse me we’d like to check in “ she then lifted her head and told us “wrong desk round the corner “ we were obviously a complete annoyance to her.  We then checked in and were told we had been given a room upgrade to a kind superior upon I asked him if we could have a Trafalgar Square view , his reply was that we’d been given an upgrade so I left it at that and we went up to the room , which was small but had everything needed but OMG the view or lack of it was a concrete office block just a few feet away , our only reason for visiting this hotel was to watch the light show that we had heard was happening in the square and we thought we could watch it from the room . 
Breakfast was another disappointment , no decaf tea and no toast ???? A simple continental breakfast was offered and we were seated next to a family with two screaming children when the restaurant was empty why sit us next to the noisy family ??
We were so annoyed and upset about this that we just checked out at 8 am .
We used all our Hilton honours points for this one night break and I am very Ngry and upset at the way we were treated .",1,2018,01,20
145,A great stay,"This is a great hotel with well appointed rooms and a team that  genuinely want to help. Its a very convenient location and for all the London attractions and it also has a good food and drink offering, especially the roof top bar which should be visited for just the view if nothing else ",5,2018,01,18
145,First class service and great location,We all thoroughly enjoyed our stay and were very impressed with both the hotel and service.  Everything from the welcome to our breakfast and departure was first class – thank you.  The location of the hotel is perfect with easy access to the heart of the city.  The views from the Roof Top bar/restaurant are amazing looking over Trafalgar Square and beyond - take a look during the day and at night.  ,5,2018,01,18
145,Wonderful hotel,"Great location and stunning views from the rooftop bar. Stayed in a king room with complimentary bar , fruit and water. Spacious room with small luxury’s such as robes and slippers. The books in the room were very interesting.",5,2018,01,16
145,A post Christmas treat,"We’ve stayed here twice now, in the last 2 years. We sight see and take in a show over the weekend. Last year we stayed and upgraded to a room to enable access to the room early. The room was ok but didn’t seem worth the extra. This last weekend we arrived at about the same time, late morning and we were able to check in and use the room straight away. We noticed on arrival how the foyer and reception desks had changed. Threw me for a moment. The refurbishment has been made to a high standard. Our room was a Queen size and we were pleasantly surprised. Fab room overlooking the square. Very quiet and the bed was very comfortable. Staff as usual were polite and attentive. Our first visit we were pleased but this time we were well impressed by the Hotel. We will be back!!",5,2018,01,15
145,"Fantastic, helpful, friendly","Absolutely brilliant from contact before the stay to helping to carry bags to the car on departure, room was clean, well presented and comfortable, staff couldn't do enough! Fantastic location and so quiet considering the location! A*****",5,2018,01,15

Modern décor; Super Comfy Bed.
Great location, step outside to Trafalgar Square, the Theater District is walking distance. 

The staff is warm and friendly - going out of their way to provide excellent service

The food was delicious and service top notch.

Wifi free; Mini Bar Water & Juices, and chocolate bar free and refilled each day.

I will be returning on my next visit to London.",5,2018,01,14
145,A wonderful Experience at the Trafalgar St James,"I stayed for 4 nights at this hotel on business and really enjoyed the experience. The hotel has a true 5 star feel about it (which is not always the case in London). From the moment I entered the hotel until leaving, all members of staff were friendly, attentive, professional and courteous. The hotel is beautifully appointed and has a wonderful mixture of modern but still paying homage to the grandness of the building. The bedroom and bathroom were really lovely, luxurious and with lots of modern touches that made my 4 nights here an absolute pleasure. An espresso coffee machine, fresh milk in the fridge, a fantastic illuminated mirror in front of the dressing table perfect for getting ready. The bathroom was large (again unusual for London) with an amazing walk-in shower and really lovely Molton Brown toiletries. And of course, you can't get a better located hotel, right on Trafalgar Square! I am told that this is the official centre of London! Well done to all staff at the Trafalgar, it was a pleasure! I will definitely be returning! ",5,2018,01,14
145,Outstanding Experience ,"I recently organised a meeting in town for our Board and wanted to impress. I’d heard great things about The Trafalgar St. James but hadn’t stayed there before. Why has I waited so long?! What a fabulous experience - attentive, professional, first class staff. A warm and friendly welcome after what had been an intense day of meetings, we were invited to the roof top bar to experience some wonderful cocktails and an amazing view. Oh and some nibbles of course. Amazing food and these were for starters. Having had a few more cocktails, you have to try the ‘Gunpowder’ we headed to the rooms to freshen up. I’ve stayed in some lovely hotels in my time and wasn’t to be disappointed. Spotlessly clean, large and everything you’d expect and want from a high end venue. The power on button for the shower’s simple yet genius - no faffing! 
We then headed out for an evening on the town. The Trafalgar’s central position’s ideal to walk to many places or for the ease of grabbing a cab right outside. Dinner over and a late nigh out, it was great to get to bed - and what a bed! Large and so comfortable I was asleep in seconds. (I’d love to know where they get their mattresses). Up early and straight to breakfast - ‘The English’ a great choice was the choice of many of the team and we were well looked after. Check out was as friendly and efficient as check in. Overall a fantastic experience and I’d highly recommend for either business or pleasure. We’ll be booking our next quarterly update session there next week. Full marks for The Trafalgar St. James. A great hotel, great team an great experience. ",5,2018,01,13
145,Great Hotel and Amazing Location,"Staff was top notch, rooms were very clean and top quality.  The staff was very helpful and offered advice on where to go eat, visit, and shop.  Would highly recommend this hotel and absolutely looking forward to staying here again soon on our yearly visit to London.",5,2018,01,11
145,"Great Hotel, Great Location!","The Trafalgar is a gem on Trafalgar Square. The location is amazing and the hotel is modern, clean and inviting. The rooms are spacious and the staff goes out of its way to help. The bartender even got us nightly buckets of ice (Americans need their ice!). Overall a great stay!",5,2018,01,10
145,There are no words!,"This is by far the best hotel I have ever stayed in. Thank you to all the staff, especially Mike for making mine and my friends stay beyond perfect. Nothing was to much, the room, the service, the food and drink was perfect every single time. So much so, I have already booked to come back in March! 

Thank you guys!!! ",5,2018,01,10
145,Very nice hotel but...,"we spent 5 nights here. For New Year's Eve, we have reserved the special event in the rooftop. The dishes were some veggies, 6 sushis, bread with 3 mushrooms, piece of lamb without nothing... service very slow.. we were starving! Moreover it was so cold (about 18 degrees) we had put back our coat! To drink, the ""flow bart"" didn't exist, or you have to reclaim all the time! Midnight, we all went on the terrasse to see the firework but when we came back, many tables disappeared whereas we still didn't eat the dessert and of course no coffee suggested; and we had to ask for a glass of champagne to celebrate the new year!!! Unbelievable! After this bad dinner, we regret a lot to spent this money for this kind of food and cold ambiance! We felt like it was a trap for 499 per person!!!! I took photos and so many people were shocked that we paid to eat that dinner! And we can say we was a bad organisation from beginning to the end! Only the hotel part was  good! But forget any event on the rooftop!",4,2018,01,10
145,Fantastic!!!,Truly amazing and perfectly located.  The staff did an amazing job taking care of our every need.  The room was the perfect size and amenities were fabulous.  We will be back and strongly recommend staying at this Hilton property!!!,5,2018,01,07

145,Excellent value in the heart of Trafalgar square,What an amazing find - this hotel is in an excellent location and the double queen rooms are perfect for a family.  You could walk to a variety of London sites and yet never feel overwhelmed by the noise or bustle of the City when you come back to the room. Great bar too if you dont want to venture outside after a day of site seeing.,5,2018,01,04
145,New and Cool,"The Trafalgar St James has undergone a big refurbishment and the result is great.  Good ground floor bar and food.  Nice modern rooms that are QUIET, which is important considering the location.  The roof top bar is a big plus.

Although I was in London on business, this would be a great hotel to be your home base for tourist activities.  It's a perfect location and filled with helpful staff.",5,2018,01,03
145,NYE,"This is the best location to stop in London for New Years Eve. It is just a short walk to the Embankment for the firework display.

Rooms are great, but don't take 410 or 510, the view is rubbish, and watch out for VAT on the bar prices, not included.",5,2018,01,03
145,Sublime,"Very difficult to find a fault with this hotel. Superb location that really can't be bettered for a tourist visit to London. The staff were absolutely faultless, cheerful & helpful at all times. Spotless room, great decor, complimentary soft drinks & capsule coffee maker in the room. The food was excellent and reasonably priced for a premium ,central London hotel. I started out by saying it was difficult to find a fault with this hotel, based on our stay over New Year 2017/18 it was impossible. We will definitely return. ",5,2018,01,03
145,Top-notch hotel,"Great location, nice room, good food and terrific service from entire staff. Arrived at night from Paris. Front desk receptionist personally escorted my wife and I to our room to make sure it was to our liking. It was indeed. We stayed over the New Years weekend. On the morning we needed to check out, the streets were blocked off for a parade. No problem; the concierge arranged for a bellman to cart our bags 3 full blocks to a waiting taxi. Amazing service from the entire staff.",5,2018,01,02
145,Excellent place ,"I stayed there with my girlfriend for a weekend in London and it was the best. We got a room with a view to the square that was amazing, the staff was friendly and everything was just right on place. I absolutely recommend it.",5,2018,01,02

Very attentive, knowledgeable and kind staff.

Super comfortable & large room.

Delicious breakfast. 

Great shampoo, conditioner, moisturizer! 

Ask the concierge for a discount for the Q Park. 

Stayed for New Year and got as a surprise a Prosecco bottle with sweets. Lovely treat after a day of tourism.  ",5,2018,01,02
145,Best location and beautiful room for 4 adults,"We all loved the Trafalgar.  The location is unbeatable, the roof top bar is spectacular.  They even had blankets for your legs if a bit chilly.   The room was large enough for four adults and very comfy beds.  The free mini bar was a plus.  You can walk everywhere to sightsee with no need for a car or parking.  The bar waiters were fun and made excellent gin and tonics. We booked for 2 nights but extended for a third it was that good.",5,2018,01,02
145,Christmas Vacations in London,"usually I spend Christmas Holidays with friends and family but this time I choose to spend them in London and specifically to this hotel. I stayed again here before the renovation and I must say that it is a totally different hotel. The Staff was extremely helpful and always willing to help you. The room was big and beautiful, I had the luck to be upgraded. Although during Christmas day almost all the shops and restaurants are closed and there was not any public transportation, it was easy to reach all the attractions by foot because of the location of the hotel and we enjoy our day. For sure I will be back again!",5,2017,12,30
145,Amazing ;),"Could not asked for more. Fantastic location with lovely huge and clean rooms.  Had dinner in the restaurant and had delicious lamb burger, we all enjoyed our meals. Breakfast in the morning is a la carte and again very tasty. Check in was little bit confusing but we have had amazing time. Make sure you have a drink at the rooftop bar as there is wonderful view as well.",5,2017,12,29
145,anniversary celebration,"My partner and I came here to celebrate our anniversary, we visit London often and have been to this hotel before and you guys have never let us down! 
the refurbishment was a must and it was truly worth it, the transformation is amazing! the room had so much more character an the touches inside were beautiful. The employees were all great, the handsome young man Yasin really did make this hotels opulence evident from check in to check out, never once did he miss an opportunity to chase us up and check on our activities and even my partners well being (caught a cold during our stay) he recommended Winter wonderland and we loved it!! 
The bar was another great improvement, with so much to offer from its stock to its knowledgable bartenders. 
Very well done and thank you for a truly memorable stay!!",5,2017,12,26
145,5 stars are not enough for this hotel :)),"Curio Trafalgar St James has trully exceeded our expectations. After the most recent refurbishment, this hotel's standards have risen up to the sky! All members of staff are extremely helpful and kind. Beds are super comfortable. Rooms are very well equiped and decorated. And all bars and restaurants are to die for!! Visiting this hotel while staying in London is an absolute must.-",5,2017,12,26
145,Wondefuk,"One night in December to see 42nd Street in the west end! The Curio Trafalgar is delightful and contemporary in design and does wonderful G+T’s ;) 

It’s right in the corner of Trafalgar Square very near charring cross tube station so it’s dead easy to get about! Leicester Square and Covent Garden is 15 mins walk away.

If you’re in the mood for luxury and great service but also not cloying as some places can be come and stay here you won’t regret it one bit! ",5,2017,12,26
145,"Fabulous location, fantastic property","We stayed at this property the week before Christmas and enjoyed the ability to walk to so many places and enjoy all the Christmas lights and decorations - from Covent Garden, Bond St, Piccadilly, Regent St and Oxford St. The staff were wonderful, and our every request was met promptly.

145,Amazing Hotel,"Stunning location and amazing rooms. Staff friendly,professional and very helpful.  
Restaurant food is delicious. The view at the Rooftop is one of the best I have ever seen, I was speachless. I will come back for sure in the future.",5,2017,12,24
145,Good hotel to stay but very expensive. If you get good deal then it’s ok to stay.,Very expensive but nice hotel to stay. Nice locality to stay. It’s very walkable distance to most of the attractions. Very good stay but felt bit disappointed with BF. Bizarre system of Breakfast. Only cold food included in the stay and pay 7 pounds to each item for warm food including toast ,4,2017,12,23
145,Centrally Positioned,"This hotel looks onto Trafalgar Square. The tube station is right on its doorstep.  Within easy walking distance to China Town, Theatre’s, shopping, fantastic restaurants and most of the tourist attractions and galleries.
A lovely hotel with excellent staff",5,2017,12,23
145,The updated Trafalgar Hilton,"The refurbishment of the hotel was a vast improvement. It was looking outdated and tired. It now looks very classy indeed. The decor is extremely tasteful, the dining room looks beautiful and the menu is very much improved. The hotel now has very efficient WiFi
At no additional cost.",5,2017,12,21
145,Superb,"Excellent location near Trafalgar Square. Superb rooms, chic and well appointed. This is a modern hotel offering everything needed for a comfortable business or leader stay. Faultless service. Super bar. Great breakfast. ",5,2017,12,19

145,Great service from start to finish!,"we booked to have christmas lunch -- arrived and met in the bar. Such courteous service - needed to charge my phone and the waiter told us that there were plugs for this - heaven!!!   the food that we were served was excellent and so was the service.  we then went upstairs to the top, took some pictures of London by night and then dived back to where it was warmer and had some more cocktails.  we enjoyed and are coming back during the Christmas season....",5,2017,12,18
145,"Space, service and silence","We arrived like drowned rats amid a downpour, but were quickly shown to reception with our cases placed descreetly to one side. Check was fairly slow, but staff were apologic saying they had big groups staying who had just booked in. The hotel was beautifully decorated for Christmas and we especially liked the arrangement beside the lifts. Out room was so unexpectedly spacious which we didn't expect as we have had much less space in more expensive hotels in London. We had two queen size bed and a wonderful view of Trafalgar Square and could enjoy the Christmas tree at night. The spacious theme continued in the bathroom with a huge deep bath and separate shower. The next surpise was the quietness at night as we heard neither guests or traffic. The pillows had a softness that gives that blissful feeling as you drift off to sleep. The highlight though was the breakfast, both the service and choice were superb. We throughly enjoyed our stay. I usually try and balance reviews by mentioning any downsides, but I can honestly say that I found none.",5,2017,12,17
145,A hotel with difference,"This is a hotel with difference.Although 5 star hotel but one notices many differences.

The rooms are spacious with 2 chairs to sit,the directory of services is on a tablet,the TV is very quiet but modern,even the shower has an on/off like electric switches rather than a turning handle or a knob.

The electric kettle is a china tea pot which is pleasant and we are thinking of buying one for our home !

The safe is hidden in the drawers,the storage space is adequate for clothes and belongings.

Soft drinks and chocolates are provided in the room bar and included within the price.

The breakfast had usual good choice in the continental but also had the unique feature  of offering one cooked dish even for vegetarians it was great!

One unique feature was 6th floor open space bar which is well worth visiting,it has good seats in the open area and the blankets are provided. The view is excellent specially around X mas with lights.

The staff are really helpful.

Overall, a different hotel with refreshing experience.",5,2017,12,16
145,Brilliant Hotel,"We stayed here during our visit to London for some sightseeing. The location for this hotel is really good and we walked to quite a lot of things. The room was nice and clean and the hotel was very modern. My favourite bit was the roof top bar, it was great sitting up there looking out over Trafalgar Square at night. The view was amazing over London. I would stay here again in the future. We travelled here by train and it wasn't too bad as we used the underground for the final stages. ",5,2017,12,15
145,"..""Cream Of The Crop"" of London Town..A Classic, Pure Elegance!","Can never fault these kind of hotels. Slap bang middle of London, opposite Trafalgar Square, Quiet room on a Sunday, excellent soundproof windows, spacious rooms, posh amenities, free soft drink mini bar a bonus!..it is truly worth it should you want to spend your money (thankfully I was on a Hilton Staff Rate). Staff were average and pleasant. Public areas had lots of Christmas decorations..lovely. The Restaurant in the evening was quiet but our waiter was very attentive and friendly (he had a man bun and slim - I do not know name but was an asset). The food was a bit tooo posh and lah-de-dah for me and portions a rather small.. Sardines for starters were the tiniest I have seen and not very warm, the Lamb Burger was average (Pulled Lamb) and the chips were gorgeous. Desserts, again rather small, and looked like the custard had evaporated during its travels from the Kitchen to the Restaurant. Breakfast in the morning was plentiful, tons of smoked salmon to fill your boots and my fave buffalo mozzarella. The Orange Juice was so refreshing! I would deffo recommend this chain and this hotel, but a bar snack may be a bit more of an advantage to me rather than the Restaurant.",5,2017,12,12
145,Employ a decent plumber,"Where do I start, on entering, lovely welcome, left our bags as we arrived early. Arrived back at 2-30 hoping to get our room to relax for a few hours before going out in the evening. To cut a long story short, after asking to be allowed to go to the room 3 times, at 4-30 we were faced with a room that absolutely smelled of raw sewerage. I know we should of asked to be moved, but as we were going out for cocktails and dinner at 6 o’clock, we lost the will to be honest. Great shame, because this hotel has a great location and the rooms were fab. Please employ some decent tradesmen in future. This should never happen if they are doing there jobs correctly. Please don’t fob me off, I know what I,m talking about.",2,2017,12,10
145,Very cool!,"I have stayed at this hotel before the refurb and returned after hearing some good things about it....and I wasn’t disappointed, what a difference!

Rooms are cool and contemporary and service I received was engaging and personalised. 

But the best part was my dining experience at the Trafalgar Dining room, what inspired food. Had the lamb rump as a mains which was cooked to perfection. You must order the chickpeas side as that is phenomenal as a meal alone.
I was sold by my waiter to try out the walnut cake.....WOW befitting of my sweet tooth. Ended the night with a couple of drinks at the Rooftop again, great range of drinks, service and of course, best views in London.

I’m a fan!!",5,2017,12,09
145,Amazing location - great staff,Very nice bespoke rooms. Perfect location and super helpful staff. Good amenities and although we didn’t have breakfast in the hotel it did look great. We would definitely stay again in the future. Fab hotel,5,2017,12,08
145,Not a business hotel; don't stay if you have morning meetings,"I'm still at the hotel now.  The renovation is nice, the hotel is well-appointed, the hotel would be great if I were here for a guys' weekend.  But the hotel has a rooftop bar with a loud DJ who plays until 2 AM.  To the hotel's credit, they did close early, but I had already been awake for hours.  It's unacceptable for a hotel to cater to club/bar patrons at the expense of its hotel guests.  People stay in a hotel to sleep.  If the hotel takes actions, as this one does, that make it difficult to sleep, it's not a hotel I can recommend.  

TL;DR: don't stay here if you have meetings or other needs that require going to bed before 1 or 2 AM.",3,2017,12,07
145,Best Hilton choice in London!,"I was searching for a reservation with HHonors points in London, expecting to use them at one of the Doubletrees I've stayed in before.  I couldn't believe my eyes when I saw that for nearly the same number of points, I could stay at the Trafalgar St. James!  I knew the location would be perfect, as I prefer to walk everywhere in London and I was certainly right about that.  However, I had no idea how beautiful this hotel would be, how delightful the staff would be, or how much I would enjoy the restaurant.  The design of this hotel is outstanding, with lovely finishes and beautiful surprise details at every turn.  It was fantastic to not only be able to step out of the door into central London, but to easily be able to return to the hotel mid-afternoon for a rest.  We had a lovely post-dinner stroll down the Mall to Buckingham Palace one evening to see it lit up and it was literally at our back door.  I've never met a Hilton property in London that I didn't like, but this one is outstanding!",5,2017,12,07
145,Very Good,"I visited this hotel for a business trip for 6 nights with 6 of my colleagues, while 2 of us had bad experiences, the rest of us loved the hotel. The rooms are very comfortable, mine was on level 1 and I could not hear a THING and slept soundly every night in a very comfortable bed. It is a great location, close to Piccadilly and st James, with great food and shopping nearby.",5,2017,12,06
145,Excellent,"Exceptional service on arriving and leaving. Very nice room, nicely decorated and roomy. View of Trafalgar Square is great. Food not super, but OK. Nice feature to be able to play music with airplay. Very highly recommended. 
",5,2017,12,04
145,Outstanding in Every Way,"We love the location, the room was really nice and the staff was outstanding! Great value for the money in a London hotel. We had room 209, a Trafalgar junior suite. Lots of space and very modern. Have a cocktail at the bar with bartenders Dean, Massimo, Mateo and Adan, all great guys, and checkout the rooftop bar too.",5,2017,12,02
145,A little gem!,"We stayed here for one night recently and we were impressed. As Hilton Honors members we wanted to experience the Curio Collection and so decided to try The Trafalgar. The Hilton branding is virtually absent, but the service is very evident. We were  greeted very warmly on check in and upgraded to a King room. We mentioned our plan to visit the Rooftop Bar later in the evening and were advised to reserve. That was done for us by the check in staff. Our room was modern, with clean lines.....very pleasant. The complimentary mini bar was a nice touch. The room was a good size with all amenities - bathrobes, iron and toiletries...everything you'd need for your stay. We visited the Rooftop Bar later in the evening, and it was busy! So pleased we had reserved a table. We enjoyed stunning views of London and efficient, pleasant service while we were there, and thought we would visit again soon. Breakfast the next morning was good. We did not try the hot choices as we were going to lunch later in the day. The restaurant was a bit busy, but we liked the fact that the tables were not too close to each other as you can get in some hotel restaurants.Service was good. One minor hiccup.....I think they forgot our coffee order, but as soon as I asked again, the coffees arrived within a few minutes. Our check out experience was pleasant and efficient. The location of this hotel is great, the staff members are attentive and our room was brilliant. Thank you for a lovely experience. We will stay here again!",5,2017,12,02
145,Perfect Weekend,"It was excellent. A lovely large room with comfortable bed. Delicious breakfast both buffet and a'la carte. Very attentive staff, helpful, knowledgeable.   Perfect hotel. Perfect location. Perfect stay.",5,2017,11,28
145,"Nice hotel, great location ","My husband and I stayed here for one night, but would have happily stayed longer if our schedule allowed. The hotel is very close to the underground and walkable to great shopping, restaurants, and shows. It’s close to many London must sees. The lobby is modern and clean. We didn’t eat at the hotel but the restaurant looked nice and was busy. Our room was lovely and well appointed. Everything was clean and the mini fridge was stocked with water, juice, soda, milk, and even biscuits all complimentary, which was a nice bonus. The room had an iPad for personal use or to order room amenities, which was very cool but don’t forget to turn the screen off otherwise the light will wake you up in the middle of the night. ",5,2017,11,28
145,Great hotel in a perfect location,"Stayed two nights. Lovely hotel. Very friendly, efficient team. Great breakfast and amazing rooftop bar. Rooms were amazingly quiet for such a central location just off Trafalgar square. Highly recommended.",5,2017,11,26
145,Curio,"Beautiful hotel with excellent staff and food, situated overlooking Trafalgar Square it was the ideal location to get to the theatre easily, the rooftop bar gives an excellent view. The best smoked haddock I have ever had in a hotel!!",5,2017,11,21
145,Great Experience.,"Good large room and bathroom - 2 queen size bed-room. Modern decor, quality linen and pillows, good coffee machine in room. Very good lunch/dinning rooms and roof top bar. Great location close to tube station, parks for a good early day run and in front of Natl Gallery and close to Bond/Oxford streets commercial areas.",5,2017,11,21
145,Fantastic stay,"Had a great time lovely big room, staff are very friendly and helpful. Location is ideal for shopping and theatres. Has a rooftop bar and a downstairs bar both very good. Definitely recommend this hotel to my friends and family.",5,2017,11,21
145,Excellent Hotel,"Just come home from 2 nights at this lovely hotel. The first thing that hits you is the friendliness of the staff when you arrive, helping with your bags as soon as you get out of the taxi and the lovely friendly staff at check in. Wish i could remember the names of the lovely staff there this weekend as they were very helpful and knowledgeable to us and very nice to the children. They recommended a lovely restaurant for us for saturday night and rang and got us a table. Very nice bar staff too who brought  us 4 glasses of water to our table on Sunday whilst we was waiting for our taxi to arrive. We didn't order drinks in case our taxi arrived early and thought it was a very nice touch (one of many) to bring us glasses of water while we sat and waited to leave. 
Hotel is in an excellent location in Trafalgar Square and is within walking distance of shops restaurants and theatres. 
Our room was perfect for our family of 2 adults and 2 children (which is sometimes hard to find) with 2 double beds in the room. Very comfortable beds. Mimi bar which is included in the room price. Tea and coffee making facilities with a small bottle of milk in the fridge which i thought was another nice little touch. Iron and ironing board provided in the room too. Couldn't fault anything in the room there was enough cups for us all and enough towels too. 
Food was absolutely delicious. Breakfast was one of the nicest we have ever had.
The only complaint i would have was the wifi was quite bad and ended up turning off the hotel wifi to be able to use the internet. 
We went up to the rooftop bar on sunday afternoon before we left as children are allowed up there in the day time. Excellent roof top bar with blankets on the back of the chairs and lovely views over London.
Would not hesitate to book this hotel again when we are next in London.",5,2017,11,20
145,"Amazing location, amazing hotel, amazing stay!!","Whilst we have stayed at this hotel earlier this year, this was during the refurbishment works.  Now these are complete, the hotel is simply stunning.

The thing that drew me to the hotel initially was the location as this overlooks Trafalgar Square and is literally a 5-10 minute walk into Covent Garden and the West End Theatres.  What they have now done is turn this hotel into a great example of how you can combine historic features with modern décor and still maintain the character of the hotel.

On arrival at the hotel we were greeted by two members of staff who took our cases and pointed us to the check-in desk.  We were dealt with promptly and politely by a member of staff and given our room key.

We had been upgraded to a King Room because of my Hilton Honors status which was a very nice bonus, although the standard rooms are still fantastic.

The room we stayed in was on the 5th floor and was decorated with interesting art, including an artistic impression of Mick Jagger.  The room did have some of the features you would expect to see in an old building such as this - large floor to ceiling windows and high ceilings but the décor is very modern and personally I think they've done an excellent job in getting the balance right between contemporary and traditional.

When we checked in we asked if it was possible to go up to the rooftop bar for a drink, which the reception staff confirmed was no problem.  This is accessed either by going up in the normal lift to the 6th floor and walking up some stairs or there is a direct lift in reception that takes you to the rooftop.  I would recommend making a reservation if you are staying in a busy time as we arrived on a Wednesday in November and it was still very busy.  However, we got a table and sampled some of the most amazing views of London you could imagine whilst sat under the blankets provided and drinking an excellent glass of wine from their selection.  I cannot recommend the rooftop bar more - this simply has to be experienced if you are staying at the Trafalgar.

Breakfast was something we experienced the following day with the continental buffet more than adequate.  We didn't go for any hot choices but they looked very nice as they came out of the kitchen.  We were eating early that day so we didn't want too much to eat.

All in all, this is one of the best hotels in London that I have stayed.  All the charm of a historic building, all the benefits of an excellent location and the rooftop bar just adds to the experience.  Thoroughly recommended.",5,2017,11,17
145,Beautiful location ruined by rude and apathetic staff.,"This is a sad example of how a beautiful property can be ruined by terrible hospitality! As an ex Hotel Manager (for 10 years) and a Hilton Honors member for the last 17 years, I was treated like absolute garbage.

I had a serious emergency where I had to move up my reservation one day, and that evening tried to extend for one night to make up for it. The Reservations/Revenue manager had the least empathy of any hotel employee I have met in 20 years, she personally DENIED me of speaking with the General Manager, even after several attempts. Incredibly, they (her? the GM?) told Hilton Honors flat out lies, saying they had offered me a discount to stay and that our dispute had been successfully resolved. The evening manager tried to help extending my reservation but upon being unsuccessful he told me ""don't worry, we will fix it tomorrow, you are not going anywhere"", only for the next day for the Reservations Manager to tell me to go find another place to stay. This experience will make me leave Hilton Honors after almost 18 years. I have tried to speak with higher ups and it seems impossible. Hospitality is a word that is obviously not understood in this property, perhaps company anymore.",1,2017,11,16
145,Great location,"The hotel is perfectly situated near the National Gallery and walking distance to West End. Rooms are a good size, clean  rooms and staff are friendly and willing to assist. Good selection of food for breakfast.",5,2017,11,15
145,Tastefully decorated hotel,"I stayed here for 2 nights on business in November 2017. 

The hotel is very artistic and the rooms are very well finished.  My room didn't feel the largest but was very quiet despite being over the main road and was tastefully appointed.

The check-in experience felt a little cold in terms of the manner of the reception chap and not overly welcoming but that point to me was minor.  Also despite being a diamond hilton member I wasn't offered a free upgrade but I could pay £50 per night to get one - this wasn't what I would fully expect from a Hilton when rooms are clearly available.

I would certaibly stay here again, but there are other choices for the price that mean it's not a given if the price isn't competitive.",4,2017,11,14
145,Location and high quality experience,"Fantastic experience throughout the stay, the Trafalgar St James and it’s staff provide a top level quality hotel experience. The location is unbeatable, great access to London’s top locations and the rooftop bar is a hidden gem. The Trafalgar St James is now my favorite London hotel, I had an amazing vacation.",5,2017,11,13
145,Great location and great rooftop bar,"Great location on Trafalgar Square (yes, actually on the square, not 2-3 blocks away claiming “Trafalgar Square”). Terrific views from the newly opened rooftop bar. If you don’t stay here, I recommend stopping by the rooftop bar, at least. Close to Mayfair, SoHo, and Piccadilly Circus, and the Bakerloo subway (tube) is right outside the door. 
Big rooms (for London), good towels, toiletries, etc. This is a Hilton brand hotel (and apparently used to be named “Hilton”), so you can expect the same beds, toiletries, etc. that are in other Hilton’s. All solid. 
Don’t expect a great view of Trafalgar Square from your room. Very few of them have direct views of it. But, just go to the roof for the best view available. 
There is a restaurant and bar on the first floor. They are decent. 
Very nice and helpful staff. ",5,2017,11,10
145,"Great location, staff and accomodations","Would definitely recommend to others.  The staff went of their way several times to make this an outstanding stay, not just a good one. The room was chic, clean and well designed for both sitting and sleeping. The location is excellent for both sightseeing and traveling to and from major transportation lines",5,2017,11,09
145,Property was perfect.  Location was perfect.,"Our room was very nice on the second floor. They included coffee, drinks and snacks.  The bathroom was amazing with great shower and robes that fit even the bigger of us.  The staff was so helpful with ideas and places to go. Thanks guys..",5,2017,11,08
145,Perfect stay,"We spent the last night in this pretty cool hotel. Everything is really very chic and stylish and it‘s very clean. The beds are very comfortable. Although we paid the night with Hilton Honors Points and very little money we got an upgrade. 
This beautiful hotel is directly at Trafalgar Square. So you are in the middle of everything. But we didn’t really hear much traffic noise. 
So if you have enough money you should spend it in this awesome hotel 😉",5,2017,11,08
145,Quality accommodation in a great location with exceptional service,"We stayed here recently on a leisure trip to London. Often, London hotels are cramped, noisy and offer indifferent service - not this one. It's right on Trafalgar Square but the room was spacious, luxurious and quiet. The staff were attentive, polite and efficient from arrival to departure. The food in the restaurant was imaginative and of a high quality. Overall, an excellent experience. We'll be back.",5,2017,11,07
145,A great find,"The hotel has recently been renovated. The service was great. the restaurant has not yet attracted a following - but was very good. 
The hotel is right on Trafalgar Square - it is walking distance to everything - almost.",5,2017,11,04
145,"Great location, great service.","This is now the 3rd or 4th time I've stayed at this hotel and I will keep coming back. The location is fantastic with great connections to the airport for business travelers and easy to get around the city via the Tube. Service was excellent and the front desk was responsive and quick to attend to needs (they had a spare converter to lend me as I brought the wrong one and needed it for work).

The hotel has undergone some renovations resulting in a nice face-lift with a new-look restaurant and more boutique-style rooms. I had a very comfortable stay and will likely come back. My only critique is that the room didn't have a functional desk to work on, so it was quite uncomfortable using the narrow table and low padded seat. For business travelers needing to work, it would be helpful to have something more workable.",4,2017,11,04
145,"Beautiful hotel, poor HHonors recognition","As some others have written, this is a beautiful hotel that has really benefited from the recent refurbishment. I am staying here regularly (couple times a month, usually 1-3 nights at a time) and appreciate the central location and the good quality continental breakfast. However, the staff seems either poorly trained or simply averse to the idea of treating HHonors elites (am HHonors Gold, personally) any different than your typical walk-up customer. Upgrades or any other recognition are automatically sneered at and the story of the hotel being completely full is trotted out all the time. That's ok - the rooms are nice as they are and the staff are otherwise wonderful. Just don't expect any status recognition or much of a friendly greeting from the reception staff in general.",4,2017,11,03
145,Great Hotel in a prime location n,This is a great Hotel in a prime location.  The room I had was excellent. The a/c worked. The room was spotless. The rooftop bar and Resturant was a wonderful place to have a drink and overlook the London skyline,5,2017,11,03
145,"Excellent service,excellent location","I spent two nights at this hotel for business in London. I have used it before prior to recent refurbishment. The improvement is significant. The service is impeccable and it is a clean and attractive hotel. The staff are well trained,courteous and friendly and it sits on a corner of Trafalgar Square. The rooftop bar has fantastic views all over historic London. A great choice for business or tourism.",4,2017,11,03
145,Total apathy from staff,"We stayed here for a couple of beautiful nights in August. From the outside the Hotel has great appeal and upon entering the newly renovated inside matches that beauty. However, that’s where it stops. 

We checked in and were giving a room with the view of an construction elevator and the noise to match an on going construction site. The room was nicely appointed and served its purpose. 

Housekeeping in the hotel was terrible. We did not get turn down service once. After coming home one evening we noticed our rooms weren’t turned down and that there were candy wrappers on the floor. I called the front desk immediately because I thought someone broke into our room and was told that house keeping must have been in for turn down.  Which I found hard to believe because nothing in the room was different from how we left it. I was very concerned and none of the staff seemed to care. That morning, I found the manager and informed her about the previous night’s events and how it was treated and she assured me she would look into it and email me a follow up. I never heard from her again. We continued to have no turn down service and would come back from a days worth of sight seeing at 430pm to find our room still not made up yet. When we called to see if we were skipped and we were told that they were getting to it.... umm ok. 

Needless to say, I was appalled at the treatment we received after I felt someone broke into our room and at the over all treatment of myself and the other friends we were there with (all of whom had separate rooms with their own, similar issues that were met by pure apathy). 

We will not be staying here again not would I recommend to anyone.",1,2017,11,02
145,Great hotel,"One of the best stays I have had in a London hotel for some time.  Comfortable beds, modern and attractive rooms. Nice dining area and the staff were extremely helpful and friendly. Location at Trafalgar Square is also very practical too. ",5,2017,11,02
145,Vacations,"Great hotel with an excellent location in London. The same is located near the Trafalgar Square. From there you can walk to various landmarks in London including the Big Ben. The hotel have great atmosphere, great lobby bar and the rooms are great (comfy beds). Looking forward to my next stay there. I recommend!!!! ",5,2017,10,31
145,Great Hotel in Great Location,"First class services in a great hotel, staff were extremely helpful and rooms large. Roof top bar was great but recommend this is booked in advance but we were lucky enough to get in without booking. Service was world class and all staff found to be very helpful. Rooms are very large for centre of London. A little pricey but worth it.",5,2017,10,31
145,Room Cleanliness and wonderful location,"Trafalgar is great location. The room is cute and swanky and it was clean!  There is a complimentary mini-fridge with non-alcoholic beverages (water, soda and juice - tea/coffee available as well).  Friendly staff that provides attentive and great service.  Rooftop bar offers great views with nice ambiance.",5,2017,10,31
145,The Only Place to Stay in London,After a long delay on my flight this Cuiro by Hilton really made my stay wonderful. The service from check-in to check out was world class. The roof top bar was amazing. This hotel is within walking distance to everything and the underground stations. I would stay here 1000 more times.,5,2017,10,31
145,Great place in the centre,"Easy to reach via tube, conveniently located and terrific staff and accommodation. Roof top bar a pleasant change from the standard hotel bar. Highly recommended for business or leisure. Very clean hotel with modern decor throughout.",5,2017,10,31
145,Beautifully Transformed,"This hotel has been truly transformed by the recent refurbishment.  Very comfortable, lots of friendly and helpful staff.  Could not get closer to Trafalgar Square if you tried. Gorgeous cocktails on the roof top.  Nespresso machine in the rooms for the coffee lovers and I couldn't help but love the touch of a teapot shaped kettle!  Free wifi throughout.",5,2017,10,30
145,Great hotel - sensational family service,"Legendary service and impeccable staff - Redha is an absolute king so be sure to hunt him out, he will look after you and your brood. I would highly recommend this hotel based on our family stay - I'll be back again",5,2017,10,26
145,Newly refurbished,"The hotel is just finishing a refurbishment so all things are fresh and shiny. Rooms are large for central London and some will have great views of Trafalgar Square (mine didn’t) The location is fantastic for a lot of the main tourist attractions with Buckingham Palace, Westminster London Eye etc all within easy walking distance. It’s also well place for a short stroll to the theatre plus the nearest tube station only a couple of minutes walk. The staff are friendly and seemed to genuinely want to help. The gym has brand new equipment but is very small and would be difficult if more than 3 people wanted to use it.

",5,2017,10,26
145,Great hotel (but somewhat lacking Honors benefits),"I have been staying at this hotel for 10 years now; and I have reviewed it twice as The Trafalgar Hilton.  I just came back from a very nice weekend stay after the hotel was re-branded as a Curio property, and wanted to share my review.  I was anxious to see how the renovations turned out, and love everything about the new look, new rooms, and new dining options.  I really liked how they renovated the rooms - I was shown three to choose from when I presented myself for check-in, and I liked how fresh and smart they looked.  I ended up opting to pay for an upgrade to a Trafalgar Suite, and really l,liked what I got. The room was not as big as one would expect a suite to be, but it was spacious enough, especially for a solo traveller. There was a seating area and a desk, sort of sealed off with a glass (although I am not sure of the material) partition.  I also had a limited view of the Trafalgar square.  The room did look very smart and beautifully appointed, while the bed was extremely comfortable.  The bathroom was beautiful (I had both a shower and a bathtub), and I loved the new Molton Brown toiletries. The staff are friendly and courteous - as always - and it was nice to see some familiar faces. The new restaurant on the ground floor is great. Like, really great. I always thought that this hotel could benefit from a restaurant on the ground floor.  I had lunch there and enjoyed it very much. Breakfast (a continental one was offered for free as a Honors benefit) was great. I also visited the Rooftop bar on the opening day, which was great (the views are so worth it to go up there). The only let down was a virtual lack of any Honors recognition and benefits. I am a Honors Diamond member, and while I was welcomed I was informed that the only complimentary upgrade I could get was from a Queen room to a King room (which did not sound like an upgrade at all), and I had to pay (a discounted rate, I must admit) for any higher upgrade.  That felt really tacky - you either upgrade to your best room as the programme states or you don't.  I chose to pay as I wanted to stay in a nicer room, but I found this experience strange.  They used to offer drink coupons (as there is no Executive Lounge) but that benefit was also removed. So, I had a twofold impression of this hotel - one of the actual hotel, and one of a Honors property.  While I loved the former, I was not impressed with the latter.  Still, I think this is a great, beautiful even, place, and I love coming back here (and would gladly do that again). The renovations really turned this property into a standout hotel in an excellent location with a great restaurant.",4,2017,10,24
145,Beautiful place in a home's atmoshere,"It was my first time at london e sure will not the last! The Trafalguar St James is a beautiful hotel and the hosts, as Alessadro and all others, has been perfect to make this place for three days a my house at center of London. Surely i'll come back!",5,2017,10,23
145,"Great long weekend, great location, very nice hotel","Was fearful of noise being an issue given hotel is right off Trafalgar Square.... we were on the  3rd floor and frankly, never heard a sound from the street or in the hotel, extremely quiet.  Lovely room and amenities.  Great complimentary breakfast and in room soft drinks etc being an Hhonors member really pays off!  Great staff and overall stay! Highly recommended!",5,2017,10,23
145,A fabulous hotel in a central location,"This was my first stay at the Trafalgar St James and it certainly won't be my last.  From when I arrived to when I checked out I felt that all staff wanted to ensure that I wanted for nothing, were helpful and had time to give to you.  The hotel has only just had a major refurbishment and it has been done beautifully, Molton Brown in the bathrooms and a Nespresso machine in the bedroom with plentiful capsules for you to use, overall there was nothing else I wanted or needed in my room but I knew that if I did all I had to do was ask and my request would have been looked after.  The bed is so comfortable and considering the location it was so quiet in my room, I left feeling refreshed.  The inhouse information system is brilliant.  This hotel is so central and close to Charing Cross and Leicester Square station, you can get anywhere so quickly.  If you want a great hotel, centrally located in London then you need to book this hotel.  ",5,2017,10,23
145,Great Make-over,I always stay at this hotel but the new update is really nice.  Room very comfortable.  But the greatest part of this hotel is the staff.  The most attentive and welcoming and friendly.  Of course the location is perfect.,5,2017,10,21
145,Great hotel in perfect location,"Had stayed in this hotel before the recent refurbishment and although it was good before the new look is amazing. Friendly, helpful staff. Upgraded to a large king room at check in which was superb and in immaculate condition. 

Large bathroom with separate bath and shower. Mini bar with soft drinks and tea and coffee making facilities with real milk in the mini bar.

Very comfortable and quiet room and a nice view over London.

Excellent breakfast the next morning with wide range of food and drink. Hot food was available for a small supplement but the continental breakfast was perfect for us.

Overall a great hotel right in the middle of London with great transport connections on the doorstep.",5,2017,10,18
145,Top Notch,"The service here was impeccable- the staff had every detail sorted.   From the bellman at the outset of the stay to the helpful concierge, all contributed to a fantastic experience.  The rooftop bar has a phenomenal view and exceptional atmosphere.  We appreciated Sahfed as our waiter each morning at breakfast - the most helpful, enjoyable, and memorable waitstaff I’ve had in years.  Well done!",5,2017,10,17
145,Faultless....,"From the moment we arrived until the moment we left the entire experience was faultless.  The hotel is gorgeous, the rooms are stunning and comfortable. We visited The Rooftop bar and the views acros London are amazing.  The hotellocation is so central to everything too which make getting around easy.  The staff cannot do enough for you here, they truly want to ensure you have a reat experience.  Cannot recommend this hotel more.  Go, you'll not regret it!",5,2017,10,17
145,Great rooftop bar at this hotel overlooking Trafalgar Square.,"This hotel has just had a big refurbishment.
We had drinks in their new 6th floor rooftop bar.
It is open air but has canopy's and heaters.
Great views over Trafalgar Square and further.
Drinks were on the expensive side.
An enjoyable evening here.",4,2017,10,17
145,Wonderful hotel,"We had stayed here for 2 nights and it was wonderful, the rooms are huge, free drinks in the fridge. Service was top notch, the restaurant was kind enough to fix us something just before they closed. Close to everything, great restaurants around the area. Beautiful park around the corner. Overall great stay!",5,2017,10,16
145,Great location and nice refurbishment,I booked a St. James King room for a week in October.  The room was spacious and well-appointed and it was very quiet.  The location of the hotel was fantastic - everything was walking distance or easy tube ride.  The staff was welcoming and very professional.  I had a fantastic stay and would recommend the hotel to anyone.,5,2017,10,16
145,Exceptional At Everything!,"If you are looking for an exceptional hotel for business or pleasure this is it! The concierge and front desk personnel go above and beyond. The location is central to, and within walking distance from, so many of London's historical places. Room was beautiful! We will stay again next year!",5,2017,10,16
145,Wow What Service,"Ok, type service was outstanding.

Kodos to 1). Carlos who went imho out of the way to help get a reservation at Sketch for us as well as excellent suggestions of places to eat and visit.  2) Yassin (hope I spelled his name correctly) who made us feel welcomed and who followed Carlos’ lead helping us enjoy out time.  And finally, Ibbi, who made it a point to use our names to greet us coming or going.

The room was a little tight - very functional.  The bathroom was spacious and adorned with new fixtures.  I love the large shower and push button Grohe valve.

Housekeeping kept the room tidy, new towels everyday.

A superior hotel for the value.  We look forward to our next visit.",5,2017,10,13
145,Just fabulous ! ,"And to think my 11 year old daughter and myself only ended up staying here due to our booked hotel not being ready ! What a wonderful experience, fabulous building, room, service, staff, we were really looked after, we let so special, genuine interest and enthusiasm of the staff in seeing that their guests are happy! I stay in all sorts of hotels and this was on a par with the best! Loved the spacious room, bathroom, complementary goodies in the fridge, plentiful tea and coffee - as well as the essential fresh milk! We were so relaxed after staying there, brilliant location so close to restaurants, shops, theatre, National Gallery, Westminster.. upon departure I promised I would return for my birthday in December - alone this time but I’m sure I will be really looked after again. Looking forward to trying the downstairs bar and rooftop bar at that time. ",5,2017,10,12
145,Fantastic Stay,"The recent refurbishment of this hotel has been done beautifully! Fantastic location, wonderfully attentive staff and great service. We had a wonderful stay, thank you. Cannot wait to come back to try out the new rooftop terrace bar! ",5,2017,10,12
145,Outstanding Hotel in a perfect central location for the City,"I work in the accommodation sector and rate accommodation for a living, I was simply blown away by this hotel.  The hotel is perfectly located for exploring London and has been beautifully furnished and well thought out throughout.  The bed was one of the most comfortable beds I've ever slept in, the room was quiet, comfortable and spacious, I really couldn't ask for more.

The staff were fantastic from the minute we stepped foot in the door and the food was exceptional.  We grabbed dinner before the theater here for ease but I would go out of my way to eat here again when I'm next in the City even if I am not staying over - it was excellent.

Don't look any further for a fantastic hotel in the City Center, book here and you will not want to stay anywhere else again in the City.",5,2017,10,11
145,Ravishing Revamp,Top marks for a much needed and expertly executed refurbishment! Just what this iconic building required. The rooftop bar is a hidden gem in this city and the lobby bar is worth a visit in itself. A perfect hotel in the perfect location for a central London visit. ,5,2017,10,11
145,New face lift,"Been staying here for years and then it closed down , nearly, for a complete face lift
still the roof bar to re open but new bar and resteraunt are superb. Great range of cocktails with excellent servcie 
Residents bar soon to open downstairs and then the roof top re opens end Oct , even bigger ",4,2017,10,11
145,Great Stay!,"We were given an upgrade to a king room upon check-in. Room was spacious and well-appointed. Bed was very comfortable. Large bathroom with separate shower and bathtub. 
Hotel location is convenient to numerous nearby restaurants, theaters, shopping and tourist sites. Bus stops are adjacent to the hotel and include hop-on/hop-off bus lines. Two Underground stations minutes away.
Staff was extremely friendly and helpful. Would definitely stay here again when we are in London next.",5,2017,10,11
145,Best location,"I think this hotel has recently reopened after a total refurbishment so everything is new and modern, we stayed in a suite which was very spacious and light ,the temperature of the room was easily adjusted and remained just right for us ,the bed was super comfortable,great heavy curtains that kept out all the light.
The location of this hotel is fantastic come out of the main door turn left and cross the road you are in Trafalgar Square, come out the the main door turn right and your on the Mall and it's an easy stroll to Buckingham palace.",5,2017,10,10
145,Trafalgar Hotel London,"I have lodged at this hotel many times, it keeps getting better each time.  The location is wonderful and the staff is very helpful.  The room was quiet and functional though minus a desk -that may have just been an omission to my room.  The recent remodel is a plus though i miss the mood enhancing/relaxing multi-colored hallway lighting.  Great restaurant and bar area.",4,2017,10,09
145,"Fantastic hotel, location and staff","Stayed here for five nights during a recent business trip to London. The staff was very accommodating and friendly and always there for a hello or helping hand. The accommodations were outstanding as it's recently remodeled (still ongoing) and very chic and modern. A very pleasant stay. I had a room with complimentary water and soft drinks/juice and they made note to modify what was re-stocked each day for my preferences and brought up anything I needed at any time. The bar area and restaurant were great and had some excellent options for cocktails and more. The meeting area downstairs was lovely but needs to be more utilized. Whether a lounge or for guests to enjoy. It's far too nice to keep closed off. Unfortunately, the rooftop bar wasn't open which is supposed to be incredible but it will be later this month. Overall, I'd happily stay again and the location lends itself to easy transport and lots of eateries. Great hotel!",5,2017,10,08
145,Trafalgar St James London,"This hotel is the best, very clean, great rooms. the staff and facilities are all top notch at a reasonable cost. The location cant be beat, with views of Trafalgar Square and walking distance to Buckingham Palace, Covent Gardens and so many other attractions",5,2017,10,05
145,Fantastic Hilton/Curio Stay,"I had a fantastic stay. The hotel is in a wonderful location, and the staff was great.  The rooms are comfortable and clean.  The minibar is restocked with water and coke/orange juice nightly.  The location is unbeatable. The two things I found lacking, that could easily be corrected was the breakfast and a lack of lounge (I know, I know, first world diamond problems).  The breakfast included was a small spread of deli meats, pastries and yogurts, with tea and coffee, all very tasty but Hampton Inns offer a larger selection.  There was an ala carte menu you can pay for, but it negates any bonus.  Secondly was the beautiful lounge in the basement.  That should be made into a Hilton executive lounge.  Or alternatively, possibly offer Diamond or Gold members a drink voucher for each night of the stay.  Its a beautiful bar, but with a cocktail costing L13.00 against a weaker dollar, that's almost 20 dollars a drink.  Id consider spending more time there if they started me off with a drink on the house. What you do get is a fantastic location, and well maintained, recently renovated rooms.  Tube is nearby that can get you to all the big sites of the city, and lots of restaurants within walking distance.  The hotel looks like its almost finished with the refurbishment, and any noise was minimal.  I highly recommend staying here for anyone visiting for a few days, but just be prepared to live without the features of a full service Hilton.  You trade those for location.",5,2017,10,04
145,Great hotel in the perfect location,"The Trafalgar hotel is literally in Trafalgar Square. So many of. The attractions are close enough to walk. Buckingam Palace, Westminster Abbey, Parliament and so many more.
Plus restaurants, shopping, theaters and entertainment  venues.",5,2017,10,04
145,excellent location,"A good hotel, in a very convenient location, to Big Ben on foot 10 minutes, to the British Museum 30, to Victoria Station about 30 minutes, all close by, pleasant night walks.courteous staff, always ready to help. Good breakfast, all on a level.",5,2017,10,04
145,Celebration for anniversary ,"We just had a short stay this weekend and were delighted with the welcome and helpfulness of all the staff at all times during our stay. 
The food and service were just perfect, the room and it's amazing views over such a fantastic location of Trafalgar Square are awe inspiring. The location of this hotel is unsurpassed for seeing this great city with just so many places to go and sights to see literary on your doorstep. 
Two small extra gems fantastic cappuccino coffee  and HOT toast at the breakfast table set me up for a great day. 
Many thanks to all the staff for a memorable anniversary 
Looking forward to treating myself again soon 
Joe Pinner ",5,2017,10,04
145,"London ,Hilton Curio",One of The quietest rooms i ever slept in. Mr. Howard at the concierge desk was the most helpful person I have ever worked with.  The whole staff was helpful and professional. How else do you describe the feeling when 4 staff members walk you out to car and say goodbye and hope you return soon. ,5,2017,10,03
145,"Nicest Staff, Great Location","We stayed an entire week here and loved every minute of it.  The room had a view of Trafalgar Square, but we never heard a sound from outside.  We were on the 4th floor.  Upon arrival we we asked to take a seat and they brought us some hot tea while they checked us in!  What a nice way to welcome us.  The room was a small suite (upgraded) and had everything we would need.  The bed was comfy and so were the pillows.  It was quiet in the halls, as well.  Lots of doors section each room area off well.  The staff treated us as if we were family.  By the second day they knew us and that made it even more fun to stay here.  The internet connection was free and it was more than capable of anything we needed.  You do need a plug adapter if you are American, but we brought one and had no problems.  We loved ending out day with a nightcap at the bar.  Again, the freindly staff made it more fun.  We were able to walk to our theatre (Her Majestys Theatre) in 5 minutes.  We had tours that left early in the morning and never waited more than a couple of minutes for a passing taxi.  Charring Cross Station is 100 yards away if you prefer to take the Tube.  Right next to the hotel it the Admiralty Pub.  We loved that place.  And there was another restaurant that opened early and stayed open late to 50 feet the other direction (Garfunkels).  I cannot say enough about the staff, especially Hannah.  She bent over backwards making sure we felt welcome.  The small sze of the hotel also makes for that quaint feeling.  We sould definitely stay here again!",5,2017,10,03
145,"Location, location, location","This hotel, just finishing up a complete remodel in September, 2017, is a fine one for a visitor to London.  Just on the edge of Trafalgar Square, you are in walking distance to many of the central London attractions, such as West End theaters, National Gallery, Churchill's War Rooms and Buckingham Palace.  Big Ben isn't too far either.  The staff is quite friendly and eager to assist.  We were able to get assistance to book theater tickets and a private guide for a trip to Oxford and Blenheim Palace. Don't have much to report about the restaurant, as we only had the breakfast buffet, which was quite limited.  The room was large, clean, and had quality amenities.  So it provided all of the basics, but in a very stylish way.  Best thing, however, was it's central location for hailing a cab or hopping on a tour bus or just setting out on foot.  We were able to book a room using Hilton points, so I don't have knowledge about room rates.",4,2017,10,02
145,Still average despite great potential,"I'm Hilton Diamond and have stayed here 5-6 times over the past few years when my wife travels with me to London.

The newly renovated rooms are nice and some will like the total refit of the lobby/bar/restaurant. I tended to prefer the swanky hipness of the old one but its nice nonetheless. Now...the problems:

I had to complain 5 times in a 2 day stay.

1. Construction noise woke me up from a nap after arrival about 4:00 in the afternoon. Response was - yea, sorry, we can move you to a 1st or 2nd floor room (was on 4th floor). After 5 cities in 6 days I wasn't keen to move again.

2. Next morning hammering again at 8:00 am even though I was told when I specifically asked the previous day that construction ran from 10:30 to 6:30. Confirmed this at the front desk and they said they would talk to the manager to make sure it didn't happen again...

3. Guess what we heard at 9:00 the next morning?

4. Second day we were in the room when maid came at 10:00. We left at 10:15 and returned at 5:00 to no maid service. Complained to front desk on the way out and asked for FULL cleaning.

5. Returned at 6:30 to LIGHT cleaning with no wash clothes, no refresh of amenities, and full trash cans. Asked for manager at FD to request a full cleaning.

6. Returned at 10:30 to a couple of towels on the bed, no amenity refresh and no turn down.

Politely complained AGAIN. This time found the night manager Vincent who finally made sure we got a full cleaning and refresh and covered our tab at the bar while it was being handled.

Honestly, I would expect better service at a Hampton Inn. This is a top tier Hilton property. At $515/night for a room 5 complaints in 2 days is completely unacceptable.

Suggestions:

1. Promote Vincent the night manager. He was the only one who actually got the job done and displayed a good sense of customer service.
2. Arrange some type of compensation when construction noise prevents guest from the quiet enjoyment of a room.
3. Agree with other review. Buffet breakfast was chintzy for this level a property. Don't charge someone paying £400/night £7 for a pancake. Just include it in the buffet.",3,2017,10,02
145,Can be improved,"The positive:
Great location, walking distance to many attractions. 
Public transport on the door step.
Renovated rooms.
Client service oriented reception.
Things that could be better:
Construction noises were really annoying...if you are making all Sunday long noice on the 5th floor just don't put guests on 4th floor...
Breakfast - if you offer good breakfast and a free minibar, make this perfect with not trying to charge more 7 £ for omelet...if this is such a big issue to include eggs, add this amount to the room rate and make it Hilton style...
No fitness at the hotel, needed to go to the sister hotel down road.
Also extended stay hours for a long check out, was locked outside the room and had to go to the reception.",3,2017,10,01
145,Amazing Hotel,"This hotel is absolutely beautiful!  It is in a perfect location in London next to Trafalgar Square with the Underground only 30 seconds away!  The rooms are very modern, with lovely bathrooms and amazing bath tubs for those who love a good soak after long day out touring around.

145,Room in London,"We stayed at two hotels in London, both excellent. After four nights at the other location we traveled away from London an then returned for two nights at the Trafalgar Hotel. We enjoyed the Trafalgar a little better because of location and our great experiences with the hotel staff. We will return.",5,2017,09,30
145,Great property centrally located,"This Hilton property is really nice considering it's London. Rooms are spacious, on both occasions that I stayed here I was really happy with my room. Breakfast also very nice, all the way in the basement. First time I came here there was a DJ playing in the bar which is also the lobby, which made it a bit noisy but it's part of the concept (for me no issue, if you don't like a noisy lobby sometimes you probably shouldn't go here). Noticed that not all cab drivers know this hotel, they sometimes have a hard time finding the entrance. Hotel has a great rooftop bar, on which I will write a separate review.",5,2017,09,30
145,Never again,"I can't report much good news about my third (and certainly last) stay at The Trafalgar St. James.
The good first: the location.

Compared to the last two stays, the quality (service and hardware) unfortunately dropped enormously.
It started with our flight to London being cancelled and we therefore arrived a day later. 

By the way: A similar thing happened to me a few weeks ago at the Double Tree Berlin Ku'damm, where we were voluntarily credited during the European Championship (hotel completely booked up) without demand this night and not charged - without having to ask for it.

On the day of the flight cancellation I tried several times over a longer period to reach the hotel by phone, unfortunately nobody took off.
The hotel didn't respond to contact by email until the next day, only being told that according to the cancellation policy the night would have to be paid, but I didn't have to worry, the room was still available to me (surprise - I also paid).
When we arrived, we were initially surprised that there was a major construction site both in and around the hotel, which was in no way pointed out before our arrival (in some cases only one of the two remaining elevators worked).
At check-in I was informed that I had booked a room on the 2nd floor. Stick would have. On request, it was said that due to my Diamond status I would be ""upgraded"" to the 5th class. Cane can give. I informed the gentleman that I was already online for the 6th Stock would have checked in. As a result, it was only said that the two systems were not communicating with each other and I was either 2nd or 5th. Stick would have.
When I asked if there was an upgrade for Diamond Member, it was initially said that you had no availability. When I then showed the gentleman that I could very well book a studio online, it was first said that this was not possible; then that the hotel did not upgrade to the studios.
When asked if we could pay on the studio, this was answered in the affirmative.
When I asked the price, I thought it was a joke. They then wanted 400 GPB per night additional fee, which was sold to me as a significantly reduced upgrade for Diamond Member. (I could have booked the studio directly for around £200 per night in the normal booking process or during check-in it was offered as a standby upgrade for £160).
I then stopped the conversation.

The room (I could find there a welcome gift and card for another person with Diamond status - see photo) itself offered a view of a construction site about 5 meters away (see photo), in the bathroom there was mold (see photos). For the first day we received information that there will be construction noise, on the second day there was no noise, but this did not stop the construction workers from working anyway. A relaxing night's sleep on holiday was therefore unfortunately unthinkable.

In summary, I would not recommend the hotel to anyone, especially for HHonors members a stay in one of the other hotels of the Hilton group (Conrad is highly recommended) makes more sense.

The location is very good, but that is unfortunately the only thing. 

The hotel in no way meets the 5-star standard, but ultimately the prices are called for.",2,2024,09,01
145,Pleasant discovery,"Perfect location from which moving around London was very simple. The rooms are clean and with attention to detail. All the staff have always been courteous and helpful. The main attractions of the city can be reached on foot without problems but in case there is a metro stop just a few steps away. Staying in this hotel was a wonderful experience
discovery and we appreciated the hotel and its services.",5,2024,05,17
145,Incredible attention from Toni,"Incredible attention from Toni, always ready to help. All the staff always taking care of the details. Excellent location, close to good restaurants and a very good view.
Very memorable breakfast and visiting the rooftop!!!!!!",5,2024,04,27
145,Perfect location for tourists,"Impeccable attention, despite the hotel being remodeled, the staff took great care of the details with all the guests

They treated us very well for the marathon and it is also perfect for the finish.

We want to return to see how it looks after the remodeling since everything is very nice",5,2024,04,26
145,The best hotel in London,"It is a simply perfect hotel. It is located in the best possible position, in the pulsating heart of London, Trafalgar Square: all the points of interest in Westminster are within walking distance and for the rest there are countless buses that stop outside the hotel (and the tube just a stone's throw away). minute walk). In addition, the rooftop bar offers breathtaking views.

The hotel itself is beautiful, the rooms are very clean, spacious and well-kept. In addition, the decoration is modern and functional, something that is always appreciated.

Very friendly and attentive staff: the doorman Tony is a rockstar!

In one sentence: the best hotel in London.",5,2024,02,24
145,Very well located,"We went with a Booking reservation paid in advance and when we arrived on Saturday night they told us that they did not have the reservation in the system…. They did not give us the suite we had reserved and they gave us rooms with a view of a building under construction with advance payment…. They charged our card almost double what we had paid in booking, and the only solution they gave us was to talk to Booking to get our money back…. It is true that the next day a hotel manager named Lidia extended her hand to us and helped us by giving us connecting rooms… she was the only person at the reception who treated us well…. Because the night we arrived, the reception staff treated us in a very bad manner and in a very unprofessional manner.
The hotel itself was very well located, clean and pleasant except that there was only one elevator in service and since there is a bar on the terrace, taking the elevator was a very complicated issue….",4,2024,02,18
145,Good Hotel,"Very well located, close to everything you want to see. Good rooms, good staff willingness to help, very clean and tidy.
Breakfast quite abundant and diverse. If I had the tea served cold

",4,2023,11,11
145,Dream trip,"I had been dreaming of my trip to London for a long time and choosing this hotel made this trip magical. Unique experience in every sense. Very central location that allows you to reach the major attractions of the west end in just a few minutes and with pleasant walks always with your nose looking upwards (to admire the picturesque and particular buildings of the area). Metro stations very close (also consider that the London Underground is uniquely simple and punctual). Staff at the top for kindness, professionalism and courtesy. Very clean structure and attentive to customer needs, very large and carefully furnished rooms. Excellent restaurant, also boasts Italian chefs, rich breakfast both for the buffet and a la carte choices. Dream rooftop. If I were to return to London I would always choose the Trafalgar St James.",5,2023,10,03

Sehr nette und zu jeder Zeit aufmerksame Mitarbeiter haben es besonders gemacht. Was wir häufig in Hotels vermissen und hier gefunden haben:sauberes und grosses Zimmer, sehr grosses Bett mit guter Matratze, zahlreiche USB Lademöglichkeiten, gute Verdunkelungsmöglichkeit, Badezimmerspiegel mit Beschlagschutz, Kosmetikspiegel, …
Unser Highlight war das Frühstück, endlich einmal kein überladenes Büfett sonder ausgesuchte und herforragende Ware in kleinen Mengen, welche sofort frisch nach Bedarf aufgefüllt wurden. Es gab Platz im Frühstücksraum und man sitzt mit Blick auf den Trafalgar - was will man mehr. Danke für diesen tollen Aufenthalt.",5,2023,05,21
145,HOTEL FANTÁSTICO,"Un hotel de lujo, con todas las características que te puedas imaginar para sentirte mimado en una zona estratégica desde la cual puedes andar a cualquier sitio.
El desayuno es lo que más disfrutamos, a parte de la tranquilidad y amplitud de las habitaciones.
Elena Tiberi nos recibió de la manera más cariñosa, adelantando nuestras necesidades, siempre con una enorme sonrisa y con la mejor actitud, una excelente profesional.
David nos hizo el ckeck-in, un chico encantador, disponible y súper empático, después de tantas horas de viaje fue un placer haber sido recibidos por ellos.

En el desayuno hay una chica de Ecuador, de la que no recuerdo el nombre, qué maravilla, nos atendió durante toda nuestra estancia con una enorme sonrisa y un carisma que hizo de nuestros desayunos una experiencia inolvidable.

El desayuno, para aquellos que son amantes de lo natural y de excelente calidad, allí pude encontrar yogures en tarros de cristal y una gran variedad de cereales, semillas y las mermeladas .
La oferta a la carta fue tremendamente buena, el servicio muy rápido y la comida excelente.

El restaurante de noche Rockwell, tiene un ambiente tranquilo, un pequeño lujo de paz y tranquilidad, comida para todos los gustos, ofrece esa paz que en plena semana Santa Londres no puede ofrecer.
Lo mejor de todo son las vistas desde la terraza del último piso, unos cocktails estupendos!!!
Volveremos seguro!

145,Excepcional,"Un hotel increíble en todos los sentidos.

145,Cena al rooftop bar,Sono andato con la mia famiglia a cena al rooftop bar. La cena era deliziosa. Lo staff super gentile e professionale. Ma il tocco magico di questo bat è la vista! Estremamente consigliato spero di tornare il prima possibile!,5,2022,11,19
145,Hilton significa garanzia.,"Scelgo speso gli Hilton quando viaggio. Mi piace andare sul sicuro con una catena che raramente mi delude. 
Al nostro arrivo abbiamo trovato in camera un set di benvenuto con pop corn per il bambino, succo di frutta, frutta fresca, acqua e marshmallow. Acqua minerale di cortesia ogni giorno.
A Londra la scelta di hotel è vasta, probabilmente avrei trovato anche altro di pari dignità e comodità, ma mi affeziono ai brand e allo stile dei servizi offerti, e l'Hilton ha una policy che evidentemente garantisce una formazione anche del personale in ogni parte del mondo tu vada. Non posso dire altrettanto di altre realtà legate all'Hospitality.
Cominciamo dalla posizione straordinaria che permette di raggiungere qualsiasi punto di Londra in modo facile e veloce, anche e soprattutto a piedi.
Davanti alla National Gallery, questo hotel dallo stile un po' rétro si fonde perfettamente in una città che della fusione tra antico e modernissimo ha fatto il suo punto di forza. 
Le camere sono esattamente come le vedi sul sito e questo è positivo. Non puoi aspettarti brutte sorprese. L'unica pecca sono i colori delle stanze, scuri, tristi, nonostante i soffitti altissimi ti permettano di non sentirti soffocare. Sono anche molto spaziose e comode, quindi alla fine prendi questo ambiance come una nota caratteristica dei colori londinesi, sempre tendenti al grigio.
Presenti nelle stanze accappatoi (un po' pesanti...li cambierei e ne metterei di più leggeri e soffici anche al tatto), pantofole, asso da stiro, phone, tende oscuranti. Una particolarità: pur avendo una finestra su strada l'insonorizzazione è fantastica. Prodotti da bagno nella media, ma buoni. La pulizia delle stanze e degli ambienti comuni merita assolutamente una menzione particolare. Camera e bagno pulitissimi così come la hall e il ristorante, il Rockwell....andateci!. Il personale di servizio alle camere è discreto e mai invadente, sempre con il sorriso sulle labbra. Ma anche questo forse è un elemento scontato in Inghilterra dove la cortesia è un must.
Il personale alla reception gentile e propositivo, pronto a risolvere qualsiasi tuo problema con eleganza, cortesia e il tipico sense of humour inglese.
La colazione ottima, sebbene abbia notato nel dopo pandemia una riduzione delle portate offerte. In ogni caso nulla che non ti permetta di godere di una meravigliosa english breakfast con buffet e piatti caldi a tua scelta.
Un grazie particolare ad Ismail, il direttore di sala a colazione, dal sorriso coinvolgente e con un perfetto italiano. Gli auguro davvero una luminosa carriera.
Che altro aggiungere? Se andate a Londra passate qualche notte al Trafalgar St. James , non ve ne pentirete. Io tornerò presto.",5,2022,09,06
145,Excelente hotel y staff,"Buenísimo hotel, ubicación y staff.

145,Eine Perle in London. Außergewöhnlich schön..,"Das Hotel liegt super zentral, gleich an Trafalgar Square. Wer gut zu Fuß ist, kann viele Sehenswürdigkeiten zu Fuß erreichen, sonst geht die U-Bahn von Piccadilly Circus, 7 Minuten zu Fuß, oder von Charing Cross Station, 2 Minuten zu Fuß.. Zentraler geht es kaum..

Das Hotel ist super schön eingerichtet. Modern und gleichzeitig sehr stylisch. Die Zimmer sind für London Verhältnissen sehr groß, um die 30-35 Qm, modern und extrem sauber. Sehr großes Bett mit super bequeme Matratzen. Die Zimmer sind Wunderschön und sehr stylisch eingerichtet. Schminktisch mit großen Spiegel und Sitzhocker, eine Sofa, Minibar, Safe und ein extrem sauberes modernes Badezimmer mit walk-in Dusche. Sehr gut funktionierendes Klimaanlage, sehr leise und kaum zu hören.. 

Wir hätten im Zimmer als Begrüßung kleine French Macarones, die super lecker waren und ein paar andere leckere Kleinigkeiten.. Als Hilton Gold Member, hätten wir freier Minibar, mit Softdrinks und Wasser. Sehr angenehm.. 

Das Personal ist super freundlich und man  fühlt sich zur jeder Zeit willkommen und wohl.

Die Bar möchte Ich erwähnen, weil wir uns dort sehr wohl gefühlt haben. Wir haben uns sehr gerne dort aufgehalten. Sehr schön und stylisch eingerichtet. Sehr bequeme und schöne Möbeln, gedämpftes Licht und mit eine sehr schöne ruhige Atmosphäre. An den einen Abend war Live Musik. Sehr angenehme „ Old Jazz“ Musik, gesungen von eine Dame die wirklich sehr gut singen könnte. Ein speziellen Danke schön an Brian, der sehr freundlich war und alles tat um seine Gäste glücklich zu machen..

Das Frühstücksbüffet ist sehr reichhaltig und lecker. Wenn Ich einen Minuspunkt vergeben müsste, wäre es für das Frühstückspersonal.  Was dass Frühstückspersonal angeht, ist viel Luft nach oben..

Wir werden mit Sicherheit wieder kommen, wenn wir wieder in London sind. Für mich bis jetzt,  das beste Hotel in London.. Absolut zu empfehlen.

145,Mitten in London,"Wir haben das Hotel zum zweiten Mal besucht. Hier ist Lage Trumpf. Man kann zu Fuss viel sehen bzw unternehmen . Daneben ist die UBahnstation direkt gegenüber. Das Hotel ist top modern eingerichtet und familienfreundlich. Die Zimmer sind für London überdurchschnittlich gross. Sehr bequeme Betten mit angenehmer Bettwäsche. Die Fenster des Hotelzimmers sind leider nicht zu öffnen, das Raumparfum etwas aufdringlich. Da würde man gern mal frische Luft herrinlassen. Das Frühstück fanden wir für das Gebotene zu teuer, man kann fussläufig besser und deutlich günstiger frühstücken. ",4,2020,02,02

Non abbiamo avuto modo di usufruire dei servizi dell’hotel come colazione o servizio di ristorazione.

Unica cosa che mi ha spazientito è stato che la mattina dopo un bel giro in città torniamo in camera verso le 15 e le donne delle pulizie ancora non erano passate. Avendo un bimbo piccolo aveva bisogno di dormire e alle 15:20 bussano e dicono che devono pulire allora sveglio mio figlio e insomma il tempo di prepararlo ci volevano almeno 15 min per uscire, ma quelle che fanno dopo 5 min ribussano dicono che devono pulire subito perche stavano finendo il turno!!! Al che dico allora potevate venire prima!!! No c’era tanto lavoro!! E che è colpa mia? Roba da matti!

145,Zentrales Hotel mit Top-Zimmern,"Wir waren im August 2017 für ein verlängertes Wochenende in diesem Hotel. Moderne, große Zimmer sind definitiv ein Vorteil von diesem Hotel. Die Lage ist optimal mit einigen Bus- und U-Bahn-Stationen in der Nähe. 

Das inkludierte Frühstück ist zwar ausreichend, aber Extrawünsche von der Karte zu bestellen, lohnt sich absolut. 

Top-Hotel! ",5,2018,01,17
145,Tolles Hotel in perfekter Lage,"Sehr schönes Hotel, in einer perfekten Lage. Das Hotel wurde komplett saniert. Sehr nettes Personal, immer höflich und zuvorkommend. Das inklusive Frühstück lässt keine Wünsche übrig. (Wenn man es dazu gebucht hat, ansonsten extra Kosten!).Einfach nur perfekt, jederzeit wieder The Trafalgar St. James. ",5,2017,12,23
145,Perfekt für Städtetrip,"Perfekte Lage direkt am Trafalgar und gut erreichbar, Zimmer zur Hofseite und deshalb auch ruhiger Schlaf möglich. Renoviertes Zimmer. Sehr ansprechende Einrichtung. Leider war etwas Staub & Haare des Zimmerservices vorhanden......ansonsten würde ich 5* geben. Frühstück hatte gute Auswahl, jedoch extras (e.g. Eierspeisen) werden teuer verrechnet. Personal super nett und hilfsbereit.",4,2017,10,29

145,"Sehr schön gelegen, aber mit Schwächen","Waren leider während der Umbauphase dort. insbesondere die Roof-top-bar mit Blick auf den Trafalgar Square war geschlossen und auch sonst bewegte man sich in einer Baustelle. Das hielt das Hotel aber nicht davon ab, den vollen Preis zu berechnen- und darauf hingewiesen hatten sie vorher auch nicht.
Die Zimmer waren klein, aber zweckmäßig. Das Frühstück muss man vorsichtig als allenfalls sehr übersichtlich bezeichnen. das Meiste muss extra bezahlt werden. Wenn es nicht mit dabei ist, man hätte nichts verpasst.
Top ist die Lage. Absolut zentral mit U-Bahn-Station auch vor dem Hotel. Also als Ausgangspunkt für die London-Touren sicherlich mehr als ideal. Und wenn zumindest die Baustelle wieder abgeräumt ist, wäre sogar das Preis - Leistungsverhältnis akzeptabel. (wenn man etwas flexibel ist: zwei Wochen später und es hätte uns den dreifachen Preis gekostet, was es dann sicher nicht wert gesesen wäre)",3,2017,10,03
