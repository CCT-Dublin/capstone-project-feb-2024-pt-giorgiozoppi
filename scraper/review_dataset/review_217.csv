Close to the Powerscourt gardens, and distillery. Cute town nearby to enjoy local charm. 

Will be here again",5,2024,10,18
217,Stunning hotel,"Absolutely stunning place to stay it was spectacular no other words to describe it. I gave 4 stars as we went to the sally gap restaurant and for the prices that are charged the food was nothing special. 

This is a lovely hotel I definitely would stay again. Just think the food needs a bot of a revamp.",4,2024,10,15

Highly recommended.",5,2024,10,08
217,Amazing anniversary two night stay at Powerscourt!,Wasn't looking forward to the long trip from Cork but it was definitely worth it! Comfortable and luxurious room with all the details you would expect from a high quality 5- star establishment. Hotel is set in the trees with peaceful and beautiful views. Initially disappointed to find out the Sika Restaurant was closed for the duration of our stay (private function) but we could not fault our meals in the The Sally Gap Bar and Brasserie. Fantastic food and ambience. We loved the Guinness soda bread and we were allowed to purchase some from the kitchen to bring home with us! Staff at Powerscourt are friendly and excellent at their jobs. Enjoyed a wonderful massage at the spa. The pool and sauna/steam rooms are first class. Will be returning to explore Glendalough nearby and also avail of the bikes to further explore the gardens and grounds.,5,2024,10,08
217,Perfect first stop in Ireland- and the the best!,"The perfect first stop on our two week tour of Ireland for so many reasons! Close enough to Dublin Airport- we drove to Enniskerry  as soon as we arrived- and were able to get early checkin to take a much needed nap! We then used the free bicycles to go down the road to tour the Powerscourt Gardens and have lunch at the lovely- (with incredibly good food) Powerscourt House Cafe. We had a little hitch in our reservation (for some reason, we were booked for 3 rooms), but when it was resolved, by a wonderfully understanding Director of Operations (Eamon Chester) he sent a lovely fruit basket to apologize for any inconvenience. The  large room/suite was the nicest we stayed in during our entire trip- we enjoyed the free tea/coffee and pastries each morning before we left on day trips. A great bartender, (from Poland- don’t recall her name), gave us terrific advice on local sites, and taking the train to Dublin- we came back to the bar the following night to thank her for all her recommendations. Such a great location from which to tour the the Wicklow Mountain area, the tallest waterfall in Ireland, and the beautiful eastern coastal towns.",5,2024,10,06
217,tranquility and security place to stay with family and friends,"amazing stay! Eva, Gabriela and Daniel at Sika restaurant made may stay memorable! thank you so much guys! Yvonne is perfect and She is very quick to respond to guests' requests… and the younger blond concierge was helpful and super attentive, (sorry but I forgot his name) I will definitely come back again! quiet place, with good food and very polite people.",5,2024,10,04
217,Wonderful experience,"Beautiful surroundings. Excellent location. Special thanks to Mikela at reception and Powercourt hotel staff for providing us extra ordinary service and memorable experience.

Stayed here for 2 nights and plan to visit again in summer.",5,2024,09,29
217,Fabulous visit to Ireland,"John (the door man) gave us great ideas of sites to see. The hotel and grounds were fabulous. There were lots of sites to see around the area of Enniskerry. We did not want to leave, even after staying an extra night. We will be back. Ireland is truly beautiful.",5,2024,09,28
217,Five Star Plus - I didn’t want to leave,"From the moment we arrived to the moment we (reluctantly) left we were treated by the genuinely nicest and friendliest staff. It was a fabulous and relaxing weekend. Our rooms were huge (dressing room, sitting room, beautiful en-suite) and the beds so comfortable. We ate lunch in the hotel bar when we arrived on Friday afternoon and the food was top notch. Friday night we ate in the bar restaurant, gorgeous food. Saturday night we ate in the Sika restaurant, again fabulous food. I treated myself to a 90 minute calm massage which was so relaxing I floated out. This was a truely enjoyable weekend and if I could have stayed longer I would have. I will most definitely be back. Thank you all.",5,2024,09,23
217,A very special memory,"We are still dreaming about the most memorable time in our lives. The day after we got married, we stayed for two nights at Powerscourt Hotel. To say it was idyllic is an understatement. We opened our gifts & cards in our beautiful room, cycled around the most breathtaking estate in the best weather Ireland has had, relaxed in the pool, ate magnificent food and were treated with such kindness & hospitality for the duration of our stay throughout. Powerscourt will forever hold a special place in our hearts & we cannot wait to celebrate many anniversaries there in the future. Thank you to everyone working there, you may never trully understand the impact you make in creating the most special memories.",5,2024,09,22
217,Fabulous stay,"After some issues with our booking the front of house manager booked us in to a beautiful suite on the 5th floor. We had stunning views over looking the garden from all windows. We ordered a bucket of ice to our room and to our surprise a bowl of gorgeous chocolate covered strawberries were waiting for us also. Spoil yourself with a fabulous stay here, all staff supper friendly. A big thank you to the front of house manager who was so professional and polite, he set the tone for a wonderful stay.",5,2024,09,22
217,INCREDIBLE LUXURY IN BEAUTIFUL SURROUNDINGS,"From the moment we arrived until even after we departed, we were treated very well by all the staff at Powerscourt. After flying overseas from Canada, we arrived very early in the morning where in most cases we would not be allowed to check in that early. At Powerscourt the lady receiving us was very accommodating finding us a one-bedroom suite as booked.
The suite itself was spectacular as is the entire property truly a five-star luxury resort hotel in every way. Our suite had a beautiful extensive bathroom with two sinks, a full-sized bath tub and an amazing walk-in shower with both tremendous volume waterfall and hand spray heads.
The bedroom and specifically the bed was very comfortable and the room was quiet throughout our stay. The living room with a coffee and snack bar and an additional bathroom should you have guests in your suite no need for them to pass through your bedroom to use the facilities.
The suite also had a full-sized walk-in closet with several amenities, electronic safe, shoe brush, lots of hangars etc. Everything was provided to ensure a relaxed comfortable stay at Powerscourt.
Breakfast at the hotel is in a beautiful dining room looking out over the estate with full service you would expect at a luxury resort. There you can order anything off the menu or specific things you may want or you can avail yourself the very extensive and impressive buffet.
The grounds on the estate are spectacular to say the least, gardens, distillery and beautiful Wicklow County scenery. Complimentary bicycles are provided and there is more than adequate car parking available.
I would without hesitation highly recommend the Powerscourt Wicklow to anyone wanting a truly five-star luxury retreat where you can relax in absolutely beautiful surroundings.",5,2024,09,22
217,Must go.,"Hard to fault anything really, treated perfectly by everyone....no hassle with anything...the area is amazing, the hotel lobby is amazing, class pianist too.
The room was perfect....food was great, spa & pool is the best I've ever been in.",5,2024,09,21
217,Fabulous from arrival to departure!,"Fabulous! We were made to feel very special from the time we arrived to when we left. The staff were courteous, helpful and nothing was too much bother for them. The food was excellent in both of the restaurants that we experienced and we really enjoyed the wonderful pool and steam room/sauna complex. Overall we could not fault this hotel. It was simply superb.",5,2024,09,20
217,A major splash out treat,"Amazing, if you are going to splash out go for the 6th floor sugar loaf facing room with a Balcony. We sat out on the balcony in the evening having a drink looking at the view . Awesome hotel. 
We got the bike a cycled the hill on way back from river walk is a walk your bike it is steep. Or maybe it was the Distillery tour and whisky tasting before going down the hill .",5,2024,09,19
217,Powerscourt again next year.,Incredible location. Not too far from Dublin. Golfing was incredible. Spa and food were very good. John helped us with getting bikes to ride to the 3rd most beautiful gardens in the world. Top notch service! Mossy was a huge help not only on arrival with our bags but coordinating for our pickup too. We’ll be back again next year.,5,2024,09,17
217,Fabulous hotel,"What a fabulous hotel! Stunning from the moment we arrived and into the lobby, Powerscourt hotel far exceeded our expectations. The bedroom was big and the bed wonderfully comfortable, we immediately regretted that we had just booked for the one night.The staff were very friendly and super helpful. The breakfast, with the choice of buffet or served to the table or both, had a selection to rival any other hotel we’ve stayed in and was delicious as well as providing fantastic views of the garden and Sugarloaf mountain. I can’t wait to go back and would recommend it to anyone",5,2024,09,17
217,Excellent,"From John the Concierge to reception and onto Joe (Sika Restaurant Manager) and everyone in-between, our experience could only be described as fabulous. The quality and selection of food was excellent. Our room and the servicing of it was totally 5 star quality.
It was our 40th wedding anniversary and Powerscourt made it very special. Thank you Powerscourt.",5,2024,09,17
217,What an amazing vacation,"Powerscourt is an experience like no other.  From the moment you arrive, you know this hotel delivers everything you expect from a Mariott hotel and more.  The spacious rooms are fantastic for a young family with no worries over tripping over belongings with the the more than ample storage space.  The service was exemplary and the views over the Wicklow mountains was just breathtaking.  Breakfast was a firm favourite for the kids with so much choice.  Will definitely be back here",5,2024,09,14
217,"Top Notch, breathtaking location","The Powerscourt Estate, Autograph Collection and nearby Powerscourt House and Gardens is a stunning destination in Wicklow, Ireland, for garden lovers. 

The hotel itself is wonderful and well worth the drive through the countryside from the highway to get there. Everything about it is fantastic. Staff, physical plant, services, views, experience, etc. It all adds up to a special stay.

One could lose oneself in the carefully curated and maintained gardens nearby and there’s something to take everyone’s breath away.

You will be thrilled with your choice.",5,2024,09,12
217,Magical stay from start to Finish Especially for our 12 year old Great Granddaughter,"We have to start with our arrival, I had discussed this Zoe in reservations that I would like a room with a view of the sugarLoaf mountain, as we had our Great Grand daughter with us for the stay. But we where given a room looking the back of the hotel on arrival at 13.30. Room 615 
 But going down with Archie from the  and having a discussion with Charlie on reception.  we where allocated an amazing room No 640 with a balcony over looking the garden and the Sugar loaf. Just what the doctor ordered especially whinny see the Childs eyes on entering the room 
But I have to say the welcome we received from the porter staff was second to none  baggage to parking of the Car to assistance to our room and then changing rooms nothing was to much trouble  you where made to feel very special.by Mossey and Archie
Then the restaurant staff where amazing along with the exceptionalities food 
And the pleasant smile was still there from Elise at reception as we checked out
Will definitie be back again and soon",5,2024,09,10
217,Almost perfect,"I don't know how I could say enough good things about Powerscourt. I arrived here after a short stay in Dublin, and was tired of the city and asphalt and just wanted to be near nature to be able to go outside at night and lie on grass and look at stars. And I did. And it was so peaceful and quiet and lovely. 
The grounds are stunning and expansive. Borrow a blue bike and take yourself to Powerscourt House and the Riverwalk and the Distillery. 

My room was gorgeous. My travel agent had told me I was eligible for an upgrade if one was available and when they told me I had been upgraded I was picturing a slightly larger room. Instead I was in a huge suite with 2 bathrooms, a sitting room, a gigantic feather bed that I never wanted to leave, and 3 huge windows that looked out onto the lawn and mountain (and had the bonus of a front row seat to wedding photography.) 

I had dinner at the Sally Gap Brasserie which was good (Pink Salt in Bray was better), and breakfast at Sika one morning which was really good. The in-room dining was convenient, and the pizza hit the spot! Nespresso coffee was the perfect thing to help me wake up. There is a mini-bar, but I recommend going into Enniskerry for snacks and wine to keep on hand. 

Afternoon tea was nothing short of perfection. The sandwiches, champagne, treats, tea and attentive service made me feel like a princess. Do not skip it! 

And the spa! Oh my, a hot stone massage and then resting in the serenity room was magical. The pool was a great way to unwind before dinner -- lots of room (I went when it was adult-only time), plenty of towels and sitting areas. 
Highly highly recommend. 
All in all, I would return here over and over. This was a solo trip after a very stressful year, and it was exactly what I needed. I want to come back with my friends and family.

The one negative was the falcon experience that wasn't. A large part of the reason I wanted to stay here was the falcon experience, which I booked well in advance of my trip. I confirmed it that morning with the hotel and as I was outside waiting for the falconer, I get a call from the concierge that it was canceled because some event that the hotel didn't know about (??) was going to take place on the hotel's lawn, and so the falconer couldn't come because the event would scare the birds. All of which would have made sense, if it hadn't happened 5 minutes after it was supposed to start, and had happened whenever the other event had been booked with the hotel (since it was taking place on their lawn). Then I could have made other plans for the day, instead of hanging around the hotel until 11am and then having to figure out something else to do. The falconer couldn't reschedule for the next day, so I was left birdless. So, if you schedule falconry, just be aware that it might get canceled at the last minute (even though you aren't allowed to cancel at the last minute.) Hopefully whatever event it was that took place instead was amazing for everyone involved.",5,2024,09,04
217,Amazing stay,I planned a surprise engagement celebration for my partner at Powerscourt. The team there were amazing. They helped me organise all the nice little extras that really made the day that bit more special. The quick communication throughout the process with me really helped take some of the pressure off! The hotel and grounds are absolutely beautiful. Couldn't recommend Powerscourt enough.,5,2024,09,03
217,Our Happy Place,"This place is heaven on earth. The staff are absolutely incredible. So personable and attentive. Food is second to none and they make a delicious cosmo. When my husband and I need a bit of R and R we always come here. It's so relaxing. The views from any of the rooms are bursting with nature and the rooms themselves are in my opinion the best in Ireland. There is no such thing as a bad room in Powerscourt. We always spend time in the pool and use the sauna steam room etc and we both find that we leave feeling relaxed, refreshed and having made wonderful memories.",5,2024,09,03
217,5 Stars above the rest! ⭐️⭐️⭐️⭐️⭐️,"What can I say… 5 Star at its best! Myself and my husband booked a 2 night stay in this magnificent hotel and had a fantastic time from start to finish. We were met with a wonderful warm welcome followed by a quick check-in to our luxurious room which had an amazing mountain view. The room was very spacious and immaculately clean. Fabulous bathroom, loads of wardrobe space and to top it all off, a full bar with tasty treats! The Sally Gap Bar and Hotel restaurant served up delicious, beautifully presented food and the buffet breakfast was the best we’d ever experienced. This hotel lives up to its 5 stars. Couldn’t fault it. We’ve already booked our next stay and look forward to being pampered again!",5,2024,09,02
217,Wonderful short family break at Powerscourt Hotel.,"This was my first family trip to Powerscourt Hotel. Every step of the stay exceeded our expectations.

217,A real family treat,"We had a wonderful family break at Powerscourt with our two teenage kids. It was a much-needed trip for our family this summer and we were not disappointed. From the warm welcome at check in, we knew we were going to have a lovely weekend. The Powerscourt team manage to balance 5 star luxury with Irish hospitality that’s relaxed, friendly and never overbearing. We loved it all- our beautiful family suite with views of Sugarloaf mountain, the gorgeous breakfast, dinner & entertainment in The Sally Gap, exploring the estate on the hotel bikes, giant chess in the garden and the leisure facilities. Just a real treat.",5,2024,09,01
217,A perfect hotel,"We have stayed at the Powerscourt many times and each one has been a pleasure that only gets better each time.
From friendly, helpful staff to the beautiful bedrooms everything is perfect. We really like the addition of the Sally Gap restaurant where we are twice and enjoyed every mouthful. Five stars all the way.",5,2024,08,30
217,The experience should match the location,"Looks amazing as you drive into the hotel a picturesque setting with amazing grounds and nearby facilities ie the Gardens Avoaca and the Distillery However something is not quite right this after all is a five star hotel I arrived early and decided to have lunch directed to a restaurant in the basement with a very poor menu more two star than Five it lacks a cozy relaxing bar Dinner in the Sika restaurant was excellent with amazing service however after dinner we wanted a relaxing drink in the bar but the main bar near reception was closed with a sign directing us to the basement bar which is pretty plastic Breakfast was ok the buffet was average however the eggs royale were excellent
All in all a mixed bag but not what you expect from a five star hotel the Merrion it is not",3,2024,08,30
217,A truly unique and peaceful stay,"From the moment we arrived the entire stay was outstanding.. Very friendly reception staff.. An amazing room with every amenity required.. The hotel grounds are just so relaxing... And for the food in the Sally Gap bar was exquisite. J & G,😊",5,2024,08,29
217,Irish Downton Abbey,"Our new top hotel. Matches the Breakers in West Palm Beach Florida, and other Ritz Carlton properties. Husband enjoyed pool steam sauna cold splash open to all guests. Spa is beautiful. Breakfast buffet is a must at least one time. Recommend first morning. Visit the garden and historic home where you can shop, eat and stroll around the gardens. The shopping and eating don’t require a ticket to get in. Walking distance from the hotel. Best of all is the staff.",5,2024,08,27
217,"Staff with attention to detail.....they care, and it can be felt in this hotel!","Recently celebrated our wedding anniversary at Powerscourt, and as always, the team pulled out all the stops to make this a memorable experience!!
Just having the welcome note and a few chocolates beautifully arranged, set the tone of the whole stay. The room was amazing, clean and tidy with everything we needed.
I will never tire of this beautiful location, and over the years the Powerscourt hotel team continue to ""up"" the standard - keep raising the bar - thanks, from my wife and I.",5,2024,08,26
217,Nice hotel,This hotel is excellent and staff are so helpful. We went here for a friends birthday and dined in sika restaurant. Only issue was where we wanted to have a conversation with our table it was impossible. There was a group beside us who wanted to make speeches to their larger table throughout the meal. They took over the whole space. We ate our meal quickly and decided to go to lounge area ….. where the group followed us with the same idea. They then played on piano and sang for remaining time. Felt as if everyone had to be part of their group. Did spoil our stay but suppose hotel can’t control pushy people taking over,4,2024,08,26
217,Perfection,"We returned yet again to this beautiful hotel. It has to be the best in Ireland.  We had a suite overlooking Sugar Loaf mountain and the gardens with a balcony, the views were stunning and room and decor was perfect!
The staff are lovely and food very good in dining room.  Breakfasts had plenty of choice especially for people with gluten intolerance, which l really appreciated.  We hope to return soon!  Thank you.",5,2024,08,25
217,Absolutely amazing,"Spent two days here to celebrate an occasion-thoroughly enjoyable experience. Hotel is luxurious. We stayed in a king suite which was amazing. Staff were very accommodating and super friendly. We eat in both restaurants-Sika and the Sally Gap. Whilst the experience was quite different in these restaurants we thoroughly enjoyed both. The Sally Gap bar had a great buzz and staff were friendly and attentive. Breakfast again included everything you would expect in a five star hotel.
The hotel itself is decorated to high standard; indoor decor is contemporary but classic. I did not use the spa facilities but did visit the area and it looked a haven of relaxation. 
We left feeling totally relaxed having visited the local sites- Powerscourt Waterfall, the gardens, walked in the woods and Enniskerry. 
We really enjoyed the break which was definitely worth it, hassle free, luxurious surroundings and fine dining. Thank you Powerscourt",5,2024,08,21
217,Another memorable stay,"Had a wonderful one night stay last week after our previous stay in April with my daughter. We loved it so much in April that we thought we’d do it again before she flew out of the country. We first stayed in Powerscourt 9 years ago and we were not disappointed then or now. Charley on reception was excellent at check-in, friendly and gave us a great Irish welcome. We got upgraded as we had hoped and the suite did not disappoint us again. Large rooms with everything you would need to make for a very comfortable stay. Air conditioning in the room is a great addition with all the mod con controlled devices that you would need as well as luxurious  robes/ slippers and toiletries. We used the leisure facilities on 2 occasions and got  to enjoy the pool and thermal suite. Such an amazing food choice at breakfast the next day even catering for gluten free and the best use is made of local, fresh ingredients. Another memorable stay and we are already wondering when we can get another night back again. Thank you to all the staff for the wonderful job you do.",5,2024,08,21
217,Wonderful luxury in the Wicklow mountains,"Huge rooms that were so well appointed. Very thoughtful layouts

Lots of activities to walk to close by on the estate

Classy public areas

Room service was great as was the premier restaurant. The bistro restaurant turned people away who had not booked so suggest you get the restaurants booked ahead of the trip

Breakfast in the premier restaurant space - buffet with individual order options. Very good - only quibble no grapefruit!

Will be back!",5,2024,08,18
217,A memorable start and stay in Ireland,"Stayed at the Powerscourt with my family for three nights recently.  Two upon arrival to Dublin and one night before departure.   The staff was superb in all parts of the hotel, particularly John and Tatu, who were eager to help and engaged us in lovely conversation which made our stay more welcoming and memorable.  The breakfast/brunch service was a highlight for us as well, especially dining outside with a wonderful view of the grounds.",5,2024,08,18
217,Nice but didn’t blow me away,"This place had pros and cons. It is a 5 star hotel so it is indeed nice. Lovely lobby. We got great suite upgrades and an adjoining room with family which was clutch. The grounds are great - with a fountain, ample space to walk and explore, a playground. We enjoyed the pool although it wasn’t very warm. 

We had a few issues. Booking was confusing. I went back and forth with them about whether 2 kids were allowed in a room. They gave me incorrect info, I got upset, and then they relented and upgraded us for free. Upon arrival, I learned that despite booking two rooms and being Marriott Titanium, we would only have free breakfast for 2 adults. On the other hand, breakfast was free for little kids which was nice, especially since they didn’t eat anything. I also did not like the coffee situation at breakfast. You had to request the coffee, it came in a delayed manner, and it was bad. They can make you espresso drinks but it isn’t much better. And there’s no free coffee in the lobby or throughout the day. 

The air conditioning was totally broken in our room and they couldn’t get it fixed. The fridge in our room was broken and it took following up twice to get it fixed. 

I personally wouldn’t return.",4,2024,08,18
217,Blown Away!,"From Charley at Reception, such a warm friendly young lady to Elodie at breakfast 🍳 She even got me the delicious scone recipe from the chef, to Aidan, trainee manager working in the Restaurant Bar that Sunday night and all the staff of Powerscourt Hotel too many to mention…. They made my stay truly memorable. 

The package purchased included a possible upgrade and lo and behold! we were upgraded to a fabulous room with huge balcony and of course the views in Powerscourt are picturesque. 

I can’t wait to go back plus it’s a 45 minute drive from my home. Away from all the hustle and bustle and within minutes I’m transported to another world.
Sheer luxury in every sense of the word x",5,2024,08,18
217,A real treat hotel,"As a couple we were very impressed with this two night treat, it was our short holiday break and very well worth the visit. Everything from the breakfast to the bedroom accommodation was first class and well worth the visit, we were given a very warm welcome and all the staff were very helpful especially the breakfast staff. Would have to say we couldn’t recommend PowersCourt hotel as somewhere special .",5,2024,08,17
217,Exceptional Stay with Amazing Staff,"Our mother-daughter getaway at Powerscourt Hotel was perfect from start to finish. The hotel is stunning, but what truly stood out was the attentive and caring staff. They went above and beyond to ensure we had a memorable stay, even helping us quickly retrieve a jacket my mother accidentally left behind.

Our suite was luxurious, the spa was incredibly relaxing, and dinner was delicious. Every detail was handled with care and professionalism. We left feeling pampered and appreciated. Powerscourt Hotel is a must-visit for anyone seeking exceptional service and a memorable experience!",5,2024,08,17
217,Idyllic and Magical,"This stay was elevated and I would go as far as to say it was magical.  This hotel is part of beautiful estate, and nothing was left to chance.   Each of the staff we encountered were friendly and helpful and the ambience from the hotel lobby to even the corridors was second to none.  The grounds are EXQUISITE......the view 'down the lane' from the hotel into the valley with the framing of mountain peaks, stately homes to cottages,  was absolutely BEAUTIFUL.  This hotel has thought of everything...the room/suite was elevated in all of it's fixtures....high quality.  We asked for a kettle rather than the coffee maker that was in the room and in minutes a friendly young man appeared with the kettle!  Nothing was too much trouble.  On the grounds there is an Avoca Restaurant where you could get coffee tea and baked items, and on the other side of it there was a cafe which sold delicious food.   You could then take your food on to a beautiful terrace that overlooked the gardens.   The hotel has a free shuttle that runs to the nearby village of Enniskerry where you will find a lovely little Irish village where you could visit the pub or a lovely little bakery cafe which also had outside seating.  We had come to this hotel after a very stressful time, and i cannot stress enough....this was 'balm for the soul'.  We honestly did not want to leave...and my husband and I travel often, so this is high praise indeed.  Quite honestly, we cannot wait to go back.  Idyllic.",5,2024,08,16
217,Excellent,"Brian, Archie & Mossy all super friendly and helpful.
Enjoyed talking to Elliot at the Lobby Bar.
Everything here was tip top. The Suite upgrade was worth it.
Reset the chess board. The black King needs some glue.
Grounds and the Powerscourt estate & gardens next door absolutely beautiful.",5,2024,08,15
217,Highly recommend for a truly restful stay with excellent service.,"An amazingly comfortable, elegant hotel with the most lovely staff. Excellent food. Beds were a dream and I had a suite with a balcony overlooking the magnificent lawn.
The location cannot be beat for exploring the Wicklow mountains. 
My FAVORITE was that it was a short walk to the very best gardens in Ireland at Powerscourt Estate & Garden.
Say hello to Mossy for me when you check-in! He helped me with my bags the first day and checked on me throughout my stay. He could not have been more kind. For a solo traveler that was really welcomed.",5,2024,08,14
217,A wonderful experience for our 50th anniversary,"My husband and I were celebrating our 50th wedding anniversary with our immediate family (2 adults, 1 child, 1 baby) and wanted somewhere special to have a meal and an overnight stay. We booked a double room and a family room. Upon arrival, we were greeted by Jean and upgraded to two family suites (situated across the corridor from each other). Beautiful rooms (ours had a lovely view from both the sitting room and bedroom windows). Made special with the gifted heart-shaped slate dish with chocolates and a greeting card for our anniversary. We had a fabulous meal in the Sally Gap Bar and Brasserie with decorated plate wishing us a happy anniversary (lovely cocktails!). Service second to none. Breakfast the following morning was first class too. This might all sound gushy but we really had a wonderful time and it made our anniversary a truly special day. The best part about the hotel is the staff - everyone was so nice and so helpful. And, the hotel is very family-friendly. I will definitely stay there again and would be hapy to recommend it . 5 stars.",5,2024,08,14
217,10 out of 10!,"My husband and I stayed one night recently as a treat for his birthday and we CANNOT stop talking about it! It was our first night away from our baby together and everything was perfect - the room was stunning, the staff were amazing, the food was to die for (highly recommend the short rib in the Sally Gap Bar 🤤), not to mention the gorgeous grounds and gardens. I just kept thinking, when can we move in??? 10 out of 10 - worth a visit!",5,2024,08,14
217,Perfect venue with wonderful staff.,"WOW! We recently had our wedding here and it was the best weekend of our lives. From the minute we arrived, we couldn't speaker higher of the staff and service on offer. From Laura (our wedding coordinator) to Mossy (Head of Guest services) and everyone inbetween, everyone was truly brilliant. 100% must consider for anyone getting married. The magic that was created for our day was simply amazing.",5,2024,08,12
217,⭐️⭐️⭐️⭐️⭐️,"Powerscourt
A 5 star stay

From the moment we entered the front door until we departed, our stay was a five star experience.
We were immediately greeted by the porter “Tatoo” who ushered us to Clem, who checked us in. She acknowledged my Marriott status with an upgrade and breakfast.
The breakfast was excellent! Buffett as well as anything off the menu. Honey comb and gorgeous scones with fresh cream were a favorite, as was the eggs royal.
Our room was large and the bed very comfortable. We had a balcony with a great view of “sugarloaf mountain”.
We ate at the onsite “ Sally Gap” bar and brasserie, which was very good! A highlight, was a special birthday dinner at Sika.  The sugar loaf lounge was perfect for a nip of Irish whiskey after touring the property. Ash in the bar was professional and knowledgable about the area.
Excellent service, accommodations, food and drink abound. A true five star experience.",5,2024,08,11
217,"Outstanding Stay, beautiful hotel","Excellent stay, beautiful suite balcony with wonderful views of the garden and outstanding service throughout. The bed and amenities were fantastic, and the beautiful gardens adjacent to the hotel is a must, voted one of the most beautiful is the world and for a good reason (check opening hours), do not miss it !!!",5,2024,08,10
217,Fabulous place,"This is a Beautiful hotel. We went for a family wedding. The food was amazing. 
The grounds are fabulous. 
All round wounder place with lovely friendly staff and extremely clean rooms very comfortable beds. 
I would highly recommend this hotel",5,2024,08,09
217,Disappointed,"I booked a one night stay to celebrate my mother’s birthday. Check in is at 4pm and I had noted our arrival time of 3pm when I made the booking but our room wasn’t ready until 4.30pm, pretty late in the day to make use of any of the facilities. As we sat waiting to check in an elderly couple both using walking sticks struggled to carry their bags out, not one staff member offered assistance and the doorman wearing the tophat just watched them leave struggling. Dinner was okay I’ve certainly had nicer meals. The Brie starter was actually bizarre and had no Brie flavour, just a nondescript mousse like texture. The beef was okay but I’ve had better. Nivan our waiter was wonderful however and very attentive. We stayed in a suite which was beautiful. Breakfast was a disaster, I ordered from the menu instead of making use of the buffet and it took 40 minutes to arrive. I had to ask twice and the waitress grunted at me that the kitchen was busy. Absolutely fair enough and I don’t mind waiting but when I had already ordered and other parties were seated, served their orders and left before I received my food is frankly not good enough in a 5 star hotel. When the breakfast eventually arrived it was cold. The poached eggs were completely underdone and frankly quite raw. A sprinkle of raw powdered paprika and browning avocado on an overdone slice of rye bread that resembled more of a ryvita cracker rather than the sourdough as per the menu, I quickly lost my appetite. And all for the bargain price of €28. Staff seemed to be just wandering around looking lost, tables weren’t being cleared and the table next to me ordered coffees which seemed to disappear into the abyss because they never received them and this was on a Wednesday morning, I’d hate to see what it’s like at the weekend. Also bizarrely at 10am, peak breakfast time, a guy was trimming the hedging next to other parties eating their breakfast on the terrace. Considering breakfast is only served until 10.30am surely the logical thing to do would be to wait until breakfast service was finished? Leaves going everywhere not to mention the noise. We would have been better off leaving and getting breakfast in Enniskerry village before heading home. Definitely left a bad taste in my mouth checking out and I certainly wouldn’t be rushing back as the only guarantee appears to be the views.",2,2024,08,08
217,"A hotel my wife would ""live in"" ..","Powerscourt is a truly exceptional hotel, I stay in 30+ hotels a year and this is always one I love coming back to. We got married here August 2022; ceremony in the Gardens, reception in the house, and all our overseas guests (American) stayed at the hotel for 5/6 nights including us. Our wedding is constantly a topic of conversation almost 3 years on.

I am from Ireland but now I live in Florida with my family. When we have the ca$h while visiting Ireland we 100% always stay here without fail -- my wife said to me during this stay, ""I would live in Powerscourt"".

We love the Spa, the access to the Sugarloaf Mountain, the Waterfall, the private garden for bike rides + walks, I adore golf - West course has spectacular views although green fees are an additional cost but very affordable (60 Euro).

There is Irish shopping a short walk away, 3 mins, there is an art gallery, the Gardens as I mentioned - and a 12 or min walk to Enniskerry -- for all the Amerians out there Enniskerry has appeared in many Hollywood movies (Disenchanted + PS I love you come to mind).

I could honestly go on... This hotel is not to be missed, my wife is also celiac (GF) and the GF Afternoon tea is out of this world.

All I can say is - Enjoy your stay :)",5,2024,08,06
217,Anniversary celebrations ,"This was our first stay in Powerscourt, and we were excited to stay.

Check in:
We were checked in by Elise, who called Sayfe to let him know we were celebrating our wedding anniversary. They upgraded us to a beautiful suite room 422.

The Room:
This was a beautiful suite with a sitting quarter, 2 bathrooms, and 1 bedroom. I loved the small bathroom as it had under floor heating. Our bed was so big and cosy and overall a gorgeous room with luxurious furniture and fittings.

Sally Gap dining:
We dined here both nights, and the staff are all wonderful. Special mention to Ivan, who is A star and looked after us excellently and made our anniversary special.
Hugo was also most helpful, and his service was very professional. 
We had steak on our first night, and it was excellent. I loved the peanut chocolate dessert. On our second night, we enjoyed the burgers. We had cocktails, which were really good.

Breakfast:
We were fortunate to enjoy the breakfast on the Terrace outside. Great selection of everything you could wish for. I ordered an omelette on both mornings, which I enjoyed. I loved the small pots of Ballymaloe Relish.
Orange juice was so good. Excellent bacon and sausages. The service was very good.

Terrace drinks:
We enjoyed a few drinks outside and were served by Krisztian. Another excellent young man, pleasant and chatty, which was lovely.

Lobby:
We were trying to take a selfie in the lobby, and Mossy came over to take our photo. Again very helpful, offered us umbrellas as we were visiting the Gardens and helpful checking out with our luggage. He had our car sitting outside the door! Thanks Mossy.

Powerscourt Gardens:
Brian took us to The Gardens in the courtesy car. He told us the best Gardens to go to, and we loved the banter with him. The hotel kindly gave us tickets for our anniversary. They usually are 13.50 euros each. We spent a good few hours admiring the beautiful gardens. We had lunch here, it was good. We also visited the Powerscourt Waterfall, it was 7.50 euros, but it was worth it to see the highest waterfall in Ireland.

The Grounds:
The grounds are simply amazing and so well maintained. Beautiful view of Sugar Loaf mountains.

Swimming pool:
We got up early on our second morning and enjoyed the jacuzzi and pool. It is excellent.

Overall, we had a wonderful stay. We loved our room. The staff are all wonderful and courteous. There was another lady serving in the lobby bar, short hair, I think she was a supervisor, and we are sorry we can't recall her name, but she was excellent.

Thank you, Eamonn and all the team in Powerscourt Hotel, for making our anniversary so special. We loved every minute.",5,2024,08,06
217,Magical wedding experience,"We had an absolutely amazing wedding experience at Powerscourt, we started off by prepping in Powerscourt hotel which started the wedding off perfectly before heading to the house and gardens to get married.

Eamon the director of operations was brilliant, in a matter of minutes we were able to change things that were previously not possible. Both of our suites were fabulous and we especially loved the set up of the bridal suite and complementary gifts. 

We really got to have the Powerscourt experience from every member of your staff. I would highly recommend any future brides to have their weddings in the hotel for a stress free experience.

I just wanted to give a special shout out to Mossy, front of house staff, he was unbelievable from start to finish. As he helped unload our bags he asked if there was anything he could help with and a few minutes later all our problems were resolved! He helped with so many aspects of our stay from setting up the champagne tower to taking the roof off the wedding car. He also got glowing feedback from any of our wedding guests that had the pleasure of meeting him.

Your front of house staff were also very helpful in organizing breakfast baskets for my bridal party. The Sally Gap staff were fantastic, they arranged pizza’s when we got back from the wedding at early hours of the morning. Diana also had great communication over the last few months and gave us a lovely tour of the hotel to map out how our stay would go ahead of the big day.

Overall it was a 10/10 experience from everyone. We can’t wait to come back to Powerscourt for another stay. We cannot recommend them enough!",5,2024,08,06
217,A delight for all,"After an sudden cancellation of our holiday abroad we decided to treat ourselves and out 3 children to a 2 night stay at the beautiful Powerscourt hotel. And what a treat it was! I couldn't commend the staff highly enough, from the helpfulness of Marie in Reservations, to the warmest of welcomes from Doorman Brian, to the charming service of Brianna at breakfast. All this in a beautiful and charming hotel, set in the loveliest of grounds, all of which are impecabley maintained. We needn't have worried that there wouldn't be enough for the boys to do....there was ample space for them to burn off energy, a giant outdoor chess game, a swing set and  a really lovely pool. We didn't get to use the spa but I heard some ladies commenting how wonderful their treatments were. We ate in the Sally Gap bar both nights and the food was beautifully presented and absolutely delicious. The childrens' meals were of high quality and good value. The breakfast overlooking the Sugar loaf on a sunny morning was just serene.  We visited Avondale and Powerscourt Falls which we highly recommend. We took  the hotel picnic hamper which was very good value, plentiful, absolutely delicious and came with a large blanket. I thoroughly recommended this hotel. It was on our doorstep for years and I was delighted to finally stay here. It lifted the mood of our whole family after a disappointment and we all felt like we had a mini holiday in  lovely Wicklow.",5,2024,08,05
217,Stunning Hotel,"Such a beautiful hotel, stunning location, opulent relaxing interiors, great service and welcome on arrival, beautiful rooms, pool and spa, dining team in the Sally Gap restaurant were so great, compliments too to the bar staff who made delicious cocktails.

217,Best weekend at Powerscourt Hotel,"My daughter and I decided to book a weekend away to Powerscourt Hotel! We had a wonderful time from start to finish! From the lovely doorman to the receptionist, we were off to a great start. She booked dinner for the two nights for us, explained all about the complementary bikes we could use and about the Spa downstairs . Our room was fabulous, spacious with a beautiful bathroom. Dinner in both the Sally Gap and the Sika Restaurant were delicious. The staff were so friendly and helpful! Breakfast was a feast, the buffet had everything.  We sat out outside the second day it was so sunny. We had the beautiful views of the Sugar Loaf mountain, not a bad start to the day. The Spa was amazing, we had massages and facials. We came out floating on air. Between the cycling, walking, the massages and the superb  meals, we had truly the best weekend in a long time. We came back to reality fully rejuvenated. Thank you . We’ll be back, with all the family, very soon. 🤩",5,2024,08,01
217,Our favourite hotel - a home from home,"We returned to our relaxing and happy place - Powerscourt to celebrate our wedding anniversary. The staff as always provided a 5* experience, from those in reception to gym & spa, The Sally Gap Restaurant and housekeeping team. It is lovely to return and see familiar faces amongst the staff and get a chat with those we now consider friends.  This is why we always choose Powerscourt to celebrate our special occasions - it is very much home from home.",5,2024,07,30
217,A great luxury find near Dublin.,"The hotel room was beautiful, great accommodating staff and great food.

We also had our tea/coffee making facilities mini bar etc. Great television . Hairdryer robes and comfy slippers for use of the spa if you want to go there. An amazing pool jacuzzi steam room n sauna not forgetting the great gym and beauty salon for all your needs. I would highly recommend this hotel for an amazing and luxury trip. The breakfast and food is amazing and so much variety. You can even get bicycles for all family members to suit children and adults and you can ride around the estate taking in its emerge beauty.  I've been several times already and I can't wait until the opportunity arises for me to return for another amazing break. Its my most favourite of hotels I've stayed in up to date. Please go and visit powerscourt hotel and golf club you will not be disappointed in any form.,5,2024,07,29
217,Stunning Powerscourt,"First time at Powerscourt. From the minute we stepped inside we were greeted by the beautiful receptionist Makayla, she was so helpful. Our rooms were stunning.

217,A Treat,"We really enjoyed our stay at Powerscourt Autograph. With 5 star hotels you often don't get the service to match the price, but this was faultless. From concierge to front of house, they had the right balance of friendliness & professionalism. Though tbh, I'd pay for the views alone. A treat from start to finish!",5,2024,07,25
217,Three Special Days,"Powerscourt Hotel has a wonderful location in the county known as The Garden of Ireland and the hotel's extensive grounds and gardens are stunning - the Japanese Garden is really special.
Our family break of 3 days provided opportunity to walk and explore, to enjoy great food and wine in both Sika Restaurant and Sally Gap Bar, to relax in lovely bedrooms. (The hotel also caters admirably for fitness fanatics, those wanting pampered, gourmets, history buffs... :) etc.)
The staff are fabulous! They're friendly, charming, professional.  Tatu welcomed us on arrival - hope I've got the spelling of your name correct, Tatu! The friendliness of the managers, dining room staff, bar staff and housekeeping staff all contributed to our enjoyment. A great team.",5,2024,07,24
217,Magical Powerscourt,"One night away with a friend including Spa treatments & evening meal.
The setting, the rooms and ambience, all  gorgeous throughout. The Spa was incredible, so calm & spacious and the Swedish massage an excellent choice. 
Food & service at  Sally Gap Brassiere really enjoyable too…but the shining light at Powers-court is the staff…everyone in each of their roles were so professional & courteous..they elevate the Powerscourt experience to another level.
Keep up the good work!",5,2024,07,23
217,"Beautiful location, tasty food, and attentive staff combine for an excellent experience","Having heard great things, we visited Powerscourt to celebrate our first anniversary and were not disappointed.

217,A memorable visit to Powerscourt hotel.,This is a first class hotel. Service was excellent and the bedrooms  and bathrooms are to die for! The spa and indoor swimming pool are amazing; one of the best we’ve been in. We had dinner in Sally’s bar which was super and breakfast in the main dining room was very good. The location within the Powerscourt estate is fantastic where you can wander round the gardens and the Avoca shop. Have coffee on the outdoor terrace! Enniskerry is a lovely little village nearby where you can get a bus into Dublin.,5,2024,07,22
217,Fabulous hotel! Absolutely gorgeous meal in the sally gap!,"Surprise trip to powerscourt for our anniversary, everything was absolutely amazing. Got an amazing massage in the spa and we both really enjoyed ourselves couldn’t recommend it enough. We both felt so relaxed afterwards. Ate in the Sally Gap and from start to finish the meal and service were absolutely brillant! Started off with some cocktails which were out of this world! The meal was absolutely delicious! Anne was our waiter and was so attentive for the duration of our meal! Got a lovely Anniversary plate and drink served with our desserts which was a lovely touch!!

217,Perfection at Powerscourt,"We recently spent 24 hours in Powerscourt Hotel on a couples night away to mark birthday/anniversary. This hotel is simply amazing. Our room (604) was absolutely beautiful/ stunning decor & spotlessly clean / very comfortable. We received a lovely welcome at reception and all the staff we encountered during our stay were very professional, friendly & helpful.

Professional, highly responsible leadership of Director of Operations Eamon Chester evident at every level of the hotel’s operations.",5,2024,07,18
217,Amazing one night relaxing minimoon,"Mini-Moon Stay:

From check in to check out our stay was flawless. 

Check In was quick & easy.
We were shown around and how to navigate to the amenities of the hotel. 

Our Room: 
The nicest room we have stayed in, spotless clean,
the biggest most luxurious bed. We had a fabulous balcony looking out onto beautiful gardens.

We had the best nights sleep!

Afternoon Tea: 
In the sugar loaf lounge we were well looked after, extra sandwiches upon request was no issue!  We could try all the different teas.

Massages in ESPA:
I had a massage with Makayla. It was one of the best I have had in a long time!  She made me feel so comfortable and relaxed. 

The sorbet in the beautiful relaxation area was the icing on the cake.  I floated back to my room.

Dinner in SIKA:
Our dinner was devine from start to finish.
Evie, our lovely French waitress made sure we were well fed and her recommendations did not disappoint. 

Breakfast was a buffet style, with menu options to order from too. It was busy when we got down but everything was still very fresh and tasty.

Overall our stay at Powerscourt was amazing.

The staff are so friendly and accommodating. 

I would highly recommend this hotel and I cannot wait to have a return visit.",5,2024,07,17
217,"Sadly, the service did not meet the expected standards","Such a disappointment with the service quality experienced during our recent stay at The Powerscourt Hotel. My partner had booked a room and a dinner at the Sika Restaurant. While the food was delightful, the service fell significantly short of expectations.

We encountered several issues with the waiting staff, who repeatedly asked us the same questions. Additionally, the dishes from both the starters and mains remained on our table for a very extended period before being taken away. We had to request the bill three times before it was finally brought to us, as each staff member seemed either to forget or become preoccupied with other tasks. The allocation of tables to the waiting staff appeared disorganized, contributing to an overall sense of chaos.

Furthermore, we required an early departure at 7 am and hoped to have breakfast with room service. When we called reception just after 6 am, which took an inordinate amount of time to answer, we were informed that breakfast could not be delivered before 7 am due to the absence of a breakfast request form on our door. We were not informed of this requirement at check-in. Although reception offered to rectify this if we submitted the forms immediately, we found no forms or ""Do Not Disturb"" signs in our room. After another lengthy wait for reception to provide these forms, we ultimately decided to leave the breakfast request as it was becoming too late for us.

This level of service is not what one would expect from a five-star hotel. Despite the hotel's beautiful location, small details such as finding a cheap pencil on the bedside locker instead of a pen suggest a concerning trend of cost-cutting measures. Additionally, while the dressing gowns were comfortable, the face cloths were stained.

Regrettably, this experience has led us to decide not to return. The service provided did not meet the standards expected of a five-star hotel, nor those of the Bonvoy Autograph Collection.",2,2024,07,17
217,Great One Night Retreat,"Recently stayed in Powerscourt as a treat for my wife's birthday! Everything was top class from start to finish. 

Room was ready for check-in at 2pm. My wife was delighted with this as she had a spa treatment at 245pm. I informed the hotel it was her birthday prior to arrival and we got an upgrade, personalized card and a small cake in the room for her. 

She said her spa treatment was very relaxing and I enjoyed to hammam and pool area at the same time. The leisure centre was busy but it was still very relaxing. 

We opted to dine in Sally Bap Bistro and we have eaten I'm Sika a few times. The food was great...highlight was the Ribeye Steak and the Chocolate Mousse dessert. 

Eamonn, introduced himself as Deputy GM, was working the room checking guests were looked after. We had a great dining experience and popped off to bed before the live music started at 10pm. 

The next morning we had breakfast in Sika Restaurant and were greeted by Nermina who remembered us from our last stay. This was a nice touch! Breakfast was delicious and we came down before 9am to avoid the rush. 

We went for a walk up to Avoca to browse around before heading home. Dimitrius the Front Office Manager helped us a few times during our stay and also wished us farewell on departures which was great! 

A great night away! We will be back! ",5,2024,07,17
217,Fantastic!,"This resort was next to Powerscourt house and garden, which was very charming. This resort itself has huge golf courses and outdoor garden. Indoor heated pool was very comfortable for relaxing. We received a room upgrade to a luxurious family suite. Breakfast buffet provided egg and salmon benedict and fresh fruit juices.",5,2024,07,16
217,Unforgettable Afternoon Tea at The Bonvoy Powerscourt,"My family and I recently enjoyed a wonderful afternoon tea at The Bonvoy Powerscourt near Dublin, Ireland, and it was an experience to remember. The beautiful setting within the Powerscourt Estate provided a tranquil and scenic backdrop that added to the charm of our visit.

Our host, Rafiq from Kenya, was exceptional. His warm welcome and attentive service made us feel right at home. Rafiq's knowledge and enthusiasm for his role were evident, and he went above and beyond to ensure our afternoon was perfect.

The afternoon tea was a culinary delight. The selection of sandwiches, cakes, and pastries was both exquisite and beautifully presented. Each bite was a testament to the high standards of the kitchen. We also appreciated the historical insights provided about the origins of afternoon tea, which added an interesting dimension to our experience.

The entire team at The Bonvoy Powerscourt delivered impeccable service, making our visit truly special. This is a must-visit for anyone looking to indulge in a classic afternoon tea with an Irish twist. We look forward to returning soon!

Thank you, Rafiq, and the team for a memorable afternoon.",5,2024,07,11
217,Outstanding Hotel and Staff,"This was our 3rd stay. Each time gets better and better. The staff is incredible, friendly, helpful and always smiling. The hotel & grounds are beautiful - first 2 times we stayed was in Nov & Dec, the lights and atmosphere this time of year is stunning.

Back date to our November 2023 stay
Booked using Marriott points, 10 year anniversary stay and we were looking forward to concluding our travels by relaxing here. While abroad, our room was canceled - odd. Contacted the hotel, and they assured us we would have a room. DID WE EVER! Due to the hotel being at full capacity, we were given room 702 - WOW the top floor suite. AMAZING.
We were greeted by Tatoo, he loaded our luggage and brought it to the room. Very helpful and super nice guy. I was happy to see him when we returned to the hotel in June-July, 2024.

We dined at The Sally Gap before heading off to the SPA. 

Bring your bathing suit and grab your robe, this spa is well worth it!  Soak in the hot tub, swim in the pool. Don't forget the steam room & dry sauna. We like to enjoy these amenities prior to our 9 hr international flight home. 

We highly recommend this hotel. Will continue to stay here when in Ireland",5,2024,07,08
217,Wonderful stay,"I recently stayed and really enjoyed the experience 
We originally booked 3 double rooms as my friends had intended to travel from England to attend the Irish Derby stay Sunday night and the men were booked to play golf on Monday while the ladies toured the gardens and tried out the spa. They intended to fly there own plane into Ireland 
Unfortunately the weather was so bad on the Saturday they couldn’t do it. 
Myself and my partner decided to arrive early and look round the wonderful gardens and garden centre before checking in at 16.00. When we arrived our room was ready and the girl that booked us in was charming. She explained all about the facilities and booked us a table in the restaurant for dinner. 
We did the garden tour and arrived back in time to have a drink and watch The Derby 
Our dinner was wonderful and the room was very comfortable. Breakfast was great   
All in all a great weekend. 
We are planning on going back when our friends are over next",5,2024,07,08
217,Wonderful trip to the Powers court hotel.,"My wife and I are just back from our trip to the Powerscourt Hotel. Wonderful staff everyone had a greeting. We were in a twin room (as that was all was available when we booked) but we needed have been concerned however as the single beds were so large that we slept in one very comfortably. We would normally stay in the Shelbourne in Dublin,but not anymore. Unlike the Shelbourne parking is free and convenient. The Powerscourt is a fantastic building and the grounds are a picture. The room itself (504) was vast over looking the gardens. Lunch in the Sally Gap bar can recommend the pulled pork on rosemary focaccia sandwich. Then dinner again in the Sally gap I had the Cod and my wife had the Wagu beef burge both delicious. Top notch breakfast in the Sika restaurant with lots of variety. Looking forward to our return hopefully in the not too distant future.",5,2024,07,07
217,A Wonderful Hotel,"We booked this hotel as a stopover on our first night in Ireland. Wish we had stayed longer. The hotel is stunning - in a beautiful setting, adjacent to Powerscourt gardens. Our room was a one room suite with a terrace - beautifully furnished and decorated. No noise issues. Staff were all obliging. We had lunch in the Sally Gap Bar (good food) and breakfast in the hotel that was excellent. Don’t hesitate to stay here. Excellent value and our favorite hotel in Ireland.",5,2024,07,07
217,The Best Hotel property in Ireland,"Where to begin. From the moment you enter Powerscourt you know your entering a 5 Star property. This is a must visit for anyone who loves nature. I have travelled to approximately 50+ Marriott hotels (I only travel with Marriott) in the last 2 years and I will hands down say, when it comes to property presentation and guest care they are the best. Jean was the blueprint of hospitality. In all the people I have met in hospitality (Which would be in the thousands for reference), she has embodied what it means to work in hospitality. With her knowledge of the property & Marriott, as well as the overall genuine care for a guests experience. She is the blueprint for Hospitality and I believe this should be recognized. The room was magnificent because I was lucky enough to use one of my NUA with Titanium status and got a Powerscourt sweet. My boyfriend had just finished a night shift and I was lucky enough that the team had a room checked out AND cleaned by 9am to let us check in early to get some rest. I apologies for not remembering the name of the lovely receptionist who checked us in but with her manner and the way she processed the check in was seamless and a brilliant first impression of the team Powerscourt has to offer. The breakfast to the room was brilliant, on time and tasted incredible. Even going the extra mile to add or remove items that were not even on the menu just because I requested!

We have decided this is our go to hotel in Ireland and we will definitely be returning later this year!

Thank you to Jean and the incredible team at Powerscourt for making such an incredible experience, and our favorite date as a couple! You all nailed it.",5,2024,07,05
217,Fabulous afternoon tea experience,"Fabulous afternoon - wow - thank you all.
My mum arranged afternoon tea for my daughter and I along with my niece at Powerscourt Hotel and we enjoyed the most fabulous afternoon tea. 
Greeted at the front door by a pleasant young concierge man and shown to our beautiful table setting by a wonderful lass Ellie. She looked after us four so well, our table view was stunning, our tea and yummy treats were beautiful and we throughly enjoyed our couple of hours relaxing together and enjoying our wonderful experience. Thank you so much to duty manager Eden and her team for their attention to detail and service at the afternoon tea lounge. 
I recommend this very special afternoon tea experience... outstanding.",5,2024,07,04
217,Fabulous memorable 2 day stay in an exceptionally lovely hotel.,"Excellent hotel in a great location, I cannot wait to visit again. 
We stayed for two nights, it was a pleasure from start to finish. The location is perfect, the rooms a large and the views are exceptional.
The staff cannot do enough to help and went the extra mile. 
We went to the Spa, ate in both restaurants and enjoyed a visit to the Powerscourt Distillery, a very short walk away on the grounds. 
You expect hotels of this standard to be good, some leave you feeling like they are nice but nothing special. Powerscourt has the extra little something that makes it exceptional. 
It is outside Dublin but it is easy to get into Dublin via a short taxi ride and the coastal luas into Dublin city centre. 
I cannot wait to go back.",5,2024,07,04
217,Amazing stay,"From the moment we arrived, we were met with exceptional service and a warm welcome.

The highlight of our stay was undoubtedly the wonderful surprise room upgrade we received. It was the perfect touch to make my birthday celebration even more special. The room was absolutely stunning, and every detail exceeded our expectations. 

Additionally, the afternoon tea, dinner, and breakfast were all fantastic. Thank you once again for making my birthday celebration so memorable. We look forward to returning and will certainly recommend your hotel to our friends and family.",5,2024,07,02
217,Not quite up to par,"Amazing views and location, but the service is not up to par especially in the Tea main area, where we got overcharged twice due to them not having the original item available. The manager there was very judgmental and rude despite their unorganized staff.",1,2024,06,30
217,Afternoon Tea,"My daughter and I have a very enjoyable afternoon tea in The Powerscourt Hotel. We were looked after by Eden who was very courteous and friendly.
The setting looking at the Sugar Loaf is beautiful and the tea service is exquisite. Would love to do the experience again.",5,2024,06,26
217,Magical,On our arrival Maeve checked us in our room was ready before the advertised check in time. She was so friendly polite and took her time explaining everything to us. We have waited a long time for this trip and had made several bookings to return to Powerscourt unfortunately each time we had to cancel as I was just too sick to travel due to treatment for cancer. I had been in touch with Jessica Griffin via email each time we had to cancel and she was so understanding. So when we arrived Jessica had gone over and above to look after us. We literally felt like Royalty! A lovely welcome back greeting left in our magnificent room with some complementary chocolates and tickets to visit the Powerscourt Waterfall where my partner and I actually got Engaged!!!! So Powerscourt has become even more important to us now as it will be a forever memory! We met some friends in town for dinner and we were chauffeured by complementary bus into Enniskerry and when we were ready to leave we just called and we were collected and returned to our stunning room.  This was the highest of 5 star experiences in my opinion. We just felt the staff could not do enough to make us feel comfortable. Breakfast we had delivered to our stunning room as we did not want to leave it. We slept soo well the lady had to call our room as we did not hear her knock on our door!!! Please do visit Powerscourt it is not just a hotel it is a complete experience one which you will not be disappointed in. On behalf of myself and my Fiancé I would like to extend my Thanks to the Powerscourt Team for making our stay so magical. We will for sure be back!!!,5,2024,06,26
217,Very special night away,"I took my mam on a night away to celebrate her remission from cancer and her special birthday ! The second we stepped in she was made feel special by the doorman and the porter. Everyone was so helpful and friendly. We went to the spa which was beautiful and enjoyed our dinner in the evening. The waitress in the restaurant was chatting to us despite the place being super busy she asked my mam if we were staying for a special occasion, the waitress brought out a dessert to my mam. Everything about our stay was amazing and couldn’t recommend enough, the views were beautiful. The cleaning ladies and staff were so welcoming :)",5,2024,06,26
217,Hope to have the opportunity to stay at Powerscourt again.,"Where should I start? The attentive/professional staff? The amenities? The property? The food? I had the fortunate opportunity to stay at Powerscourt for a business trip and very much hope to have the opportunity to bring my family and stay at Powerscourt for a holiday. Upon arrival, the staff was very welcoming and greeted everyone with a smile. I arrived mid-afternoon on Sunday and had the opportunity to walk around the expansive and well-manicured grounds and take a complimentary bicycle down the River walk (decent hill just as a heads up) trail. The gentleman that assisted me was jovial and was great to speak with! Borrowing the bicycle was a great way to explore the grounds and stay active to stave off jet lag. I did not take the opportunity to walk the adjacent garden and now regret not taking the time on Sunday to do so ( I will the next time I stay at Powerscourt). Because I was on business I didn't have time to take in the various activities that are nearby (golf, horseback riding, fishing, distillery,....), but when I have the chance to visit Ireland again, I will partake in one or more of those listed activities.. The room I stayed in was immaculate and the housekeeping staff must be dedicated to their profession as it showed in how well the room was always made up each day. The dining options (breakfast buffet at Sikka) and dinner (Sally Gap) was wonderful and the staff at both restaurants were attentive and professional. I could go on an on, but I do hope that anyone contemplating a stay at this hotel does take the opportunity and stays long enough to enjoy the grounds and activities the hotel has to offer!",5,2024,06,25
217,Fabulous Friday night in powerscourt.,"Stayed in the powerscourt Friday the 21st of June. From start to finish the stay was amazing. The staff couldn't do enough to help but also gave you space. The entertainment in the bar was brilliant real enjoyable night and I am still thinking about the food. The pool and gym were brilliant,. 
I usually find hotel breakfast choatic this was the opposite so calm and relaxing the view was stunning we ate outside and again the food was very tasty.",5,2024,06,25
217,Absolutely Outstanding,"Wow, where do I even begin. We came to Powerscourt for my 30th birthday and our stay was nothing short of immaculate. We had stayed in another 5* hotel the night before and once we arrived at powerscourt we wished we had stayed there for two nights instead. 
Every single aspect of the hotel was well thought of, every inch spotlessly clean. On arrival, the lovely lady who checked us in was very friendly and upgraded us to a beautiful room to celebrate my birthday. When we got to the room it was honestly the nicest suite I have stayed in to date. Once again spotlessly clean, with a lovely cake and a note from the hotel to wish me happy birthday. We went for a drink in the lounge and service was fantastic and the views are impeccable. 
We then went on a walk around the property and it is really so beautiful with carefully manicured gardens. Such a wonderful afternoon walking around the estate. 
We had our dinner in the Brasserie and the food was delicious, my steak was well seasoned and perfectly cooked and the burger was really flavourful and tender. Our server was so kind and friendly even with a very busy restaurant she was totally calm. It gave for a really nice environment. 
The next morning we had breakfast in the Sika restaurant and it was DELICIOUS. The best hotel breakfast we have had, perfectly cooked eggs, delicious Belgian waffles and once again fantastic service. We went for a morning swim in the beautiful pool, it was heavenly. So relaxing and the addition of sauna and steam room was wonderful. Again, the staff in the spa area were wonderfully helpful.
All in all this is without a doubt our favourite hotel in Ireland, we are already planning to return. The staff are a credit to the hotel and absolutely make the stay!",5,2024,06,25
217,Powerscourt Hotel - relaxation with first class accommodation and dining,"My wife and I were to holiday in Oxford and London for a week but decided to change at late notice and look for somewhere in Ireland, where we could relax and recharge our batteries after a hectic six months with work and family commitments.  
Powerscourt Hotel turned out to be the best short break for four nights we have had in years!  Where do I start!  The staff, the food, the accommodation was all definitely 5 * and more.  Special mention to Joe Kendrick, the Restaurant Manger who was our perfect host at breakfast as well as making time to chat.  These are the reasons why we will be coming back to Powerscourt Hotel on a regular basis.  
Add in the world class Powerscourt Gardens, the Waterfall and the beautiful walks all so close to the hotel, what is there not to like?",5,2024,06,25
217,Another World,"We stayed in the PowersCourt a few years back with no expectation on what our time would be.
Since then, we come back at least 2-3 times a year!
Once you drive through the gates, the overall experience transfers you into another world. From the initial drive to the hotel itself with the most scenic views, to the amazing decor inside the hotel and the fabulous and courteous staff; you are immediately at peace.
We had bikes to ride to the gardens where you will spend hours taking in the most breathtaking views and the effort from the team to maintain this leaves us in awe.
The chefs kiss is the sublime options for food, between the Sika restaurant and fine dining experience or the linge where the food is beyond amazing.
All of this experience is bookended by the most amazing and pleasant staff, encapsulating the serenity around the whole place.
We have stayed in many places around the globe, but have never frequented on as much as this; you should definitely treat yourself.",5,2024,06,25
217,Amazing stay,"I would very highly recommend Powerscourt Hotel Autograph Collection it Is the best hotel I every stayed in. We were celebrating a special wedding anniversary we were upgraded to an amazing suite and upon entering we had a personalised anniversary card chocolate heart and strawberries it was such a lovely touch. The view from the balcony was just breathtaking. We felt like royalty from the moment we went through the door, the concierge was so friendly and welcoming, the staff and management so inviting and friendly. The food and drink was amazing and the breakfast the best ever so fresh and great choices. The spa and leisure centre was amazing such a relaxing experience. Everything was a 10 plus rating for us. I can’t wait to return. Thank you for an amazing experience everything was so perfect. It ticked every box. Well done to Management and staff for a very professionally run hotel. We will be back soon. Thanks Breda & Chris Droney",5,2024,06,22
217,Extremely enjoyable stay,"We had an amazing 2 night stay. This is truly a 5 star hotel. Its a mega thumbs up from me. A beautiful setting, fabulous rooms and great facilities and within close proximity of other attractions for example Powerscourt waterfall, gardens and Avoca. We will definitely return to stay at some stage in the future.",5,2024,06,21
217,Spa experience,"Went for a spa treatment, perhaps the best I have ever had. Had a deep back cleanse done and I felt great afterwards. Special thank you to Jessica and Megan for the wonderful service. Would highly reccomend  and look forward to returning in the near future.",5,2024,06,19
217,Luxury,"Great hospitality! If you find yourself arriving too early  have lunch at the Sally Gap or simply walk down to view the gardens.  The cost to walk the gardens was reasonable and the views were stunning. There were shops and a café as well. Once checked in, the room was magnificent with large bathroom and equally large dressing room, spacious bedroom and adjoining terrace with beautiful views of the grounds. Everything was neat, tidy and clean. Staff were pleasant, helpful and professional. Bed was comfortable and pillows were plentiful. We had lunch and supper at the Sally Gap - I recommend the fish and chips! Drinks were good as well.  My friend indulged in a massage at the spa and raved about the service. For a brief taste of luxury, I would definitely recommend the Powerscourt Hotel as a place to see and stay.",5,2024,06,16
217,Beautiful views,"Large rooms, beautiful bathrooms, gorgeous views, proximity to Powerscourt Gardens were all positives.  When we were there it was very busy - it felt like a convention hotel - with a packed lobby and overtaxed staff.  The views out the back (opposite side from entry) were worth the price alone.",4,2024,06,15
217,Poor quality given the price.,"Awful service. Faceless and impersonal. Towels in room were clearly not clean with grey stains present. 

Restaurants were really over priced for the poor quality of food. Service was terrible with the staff clearly undertrained and unable to handle the volume of guests.",1,2024,06,14
217,Overnight family stay,"Big bed and fluffy pillows, great selection of  food for all meals and loved the swimming pool. Gardens are buggy friendly and lovely for a walk. Playground on site is wonderful for kids. Room service was very quick and staff were very helpful",5,2024,06,13
217,"Fantastic location, staff and activities","What a great hotel for a couples weekend away for an occasion. We checked in on Sunday of the bank holiday and stayed for one night. From the time we arrived until we left the staff were just superb and so professional and friendly. The ambience of the hotel was welcoming and very comfortable. Our room was extremely spacious and had a fantastic balcony overlooking the rear of the Hotel to which we had a fantastic view of the mountains. We ate in the The Sally Gap Bar, the food was delicious and the wine too. Our breakfast the next morning was probably one of the nicest five star buffet breakfast I’ve ever experienced. We also enjoyed the grounds of the hotel and visited the surrounding activities. We also went to the pool and used the other facilities in the spa such as the crystal steam room, which was one I will definitely be going back to. I would give this hotel an extremely high rating on its staff and the  wonderful facility that it is. We will 100% be returning very soon!",5,2024,06,11
217,Magical stay,"We are very lucky to live 30 minutes from Powerscourt Hotel. 
Myself and my Husband had the most amazing night in this wonderful Hotel. From the moment we entered the front door we felt so welcome. The staff were so attentive at check in. Our room was on the 2nd floor. The room was very big with walk in wardrobe, large bathroom and lovely bedroom . We used the hotels bikes and had a lovely cycle along the river walk. Had a swim in the gorgeous pool. We ate in the Sugar Loaf restaurant. The food was really good. The waiting staff were very knowledgeable in advising what to order. 
The only thing I would change is book a room on a higher floor with a view. Looking forward to our next visit.",5,2024,06,10
217,Engagement celebration,"We had the best experience and stay in the Powerscourt after getting engaged. We got a gorgeous room upgrade with a balcony, which made it all the more special and memorable. We had a lovely congratulations chocolate left in the room.
We used the pool and saunas which was lovely and relaxing. Had a lovely dinner in the Sally Gap restaurant that night and a very good breakfast brought to our room the next morning with great room service. The staff were so friendly, helpful and couldn’t do enough for us during our special stay. Took a lovely trip the powerscourt water fall the next day and drove around Lough Tay and the sally gap. Will definitely be back, we got the 5 star treatment.",5,2024,06,10
217,"Faultless from beginning to end! Powerscourt, we will be back!!","What a fabulous stay at the best hotel we've had the pleasure of experiencing.

Upon arrival we were greeted by the most polite and helpful staff who could not have done more for us. Without asking, we were immediately given a complimentary upgrade to a Suite (for both rooms we had booked!) What a treat.

The Suites are absolutely huge, spotless and we felt like royalty with the decor, double sinks, walk in wardrobes, gowns, slippers, 2 double beds, 2 TVs and fabulous mini bar. Felt like we were in a luxury apartment!

I came with my son (it was his 9th birthday) and my mum so 3 generations and all of us couldn't have loved it more.

We were really lucky with the weather and enjoyed the stunning scenery at the gardens, which came included with the very reasonable mid week rate and also included a wonderful breakfast.

The Spa (and massage!) were out of this world and the timings for the children to use the pool (9am to 12pm and 3pm to 6pm) was excellent and fit our plans perfectly.

We dined at Sally's Gap and the food was spectacular, I especially enjoyed the burger with Montgomery cheese and onion relish. Service was wonderful too and the gins went down a treat 😊. I loved the outdoor area with all the pretty finishing touches too.

Would we return - 100%! We didn't want to leave! 

Absolutely faultless from beginning to end - thanks to all the staff.

We ended our trip with a short drive to the waterfall the next day and purchased the local honey.  Delicious!",5,2024,06,10
217,Fantastic getaway to celebrate our engagement.,"We stayed at the Powerscourt Hotel after getting engaged in Powerscourt Gardens. It was such a special day, made even more special by the fantastic and thoughtful service we received at the hotel.

From the moment we checked in, we were greeted with a warm welcome and upgraded to a suite. We celebrated in the Sugarloaf Lounge with our family, where the manager came over to personally congratulate us and offer anything we wanted, we were given complimentary crisps and nuts. The room itself was spectacular, with a bedroom, separate lounge area, walk in wardrobe and large bathroom. 

We had dinner that evening in the Sika Restaurant, again the service was phenomenal. We were given complimentary prosecco and again congratulated on our engagement. The food was delicious, presentation was excellent and we thoroughly enjoyed our meal. It was nice to see that a lot of the ingredients were sourced locally. We were also given a plate of chocolates with a congratulations message. 

The next morning we had breakfast in the restaurant, it was such a lovely day that we were able to sit out on the terrace and enjoy the spectacular views. The food was very fresh and there was plenty of choice in the buffet. Again, the service was excellent. 

We asked if it was possible to check out later, which it was, so we chose to use the leisure facilities. The pool and hammam suite were lovely, also they were very clean and the floor was swept regularly by staff to ensure it was not slippy. 

We then checked out and walked around the grounds before heading home. 

Overall, this hotel was one of the best, if not the best, hotel we've ever stayed in. The service and attention to detail are what makes this hotel 5 stars, and we could not have asked for a better experience celebrating our engagement. We will definitely come to stay again as it is such a special place.",5,2024,06,09
217,The best hotel experience ever!,"We started our Ireland family vacation at Powerscourt, spending three nights at the property.  We had 2 rooms to accommodate our family of five.  My daughterr and I stayed on the 6th floor, a balcony room overlooking the mountains, and my husband  and two sons in a first floor room.  The rooms were comfortable and roomy and just perfect.  The breakfasts each day were by far the best we have ever had and we ate our dinners at the hotel as well since the food was so good and the chef could accommodate our dietary restrings (no soy, shellfish, allium and pine nuts).  The Spa and pool were relaxing and  perfect at the end of each day of adventuring.   We enjoyed the life size chess set, walking the gardens and the proximity to Powerscourt Estate, Wicklow mountains.  The staff were amazing, each and every one. The amenities were by far the best we have experienced at any hotel.   We were touring Ireland so this was the first of 4 hotels we stayed at, each 5 star hotels.   No other hotel we stayed at came close to how wonderful Powerscourt was.  We look foward to our next trip to Ireland and Powerscourt will be our home away from home.",5,2024,06,04
217,Terrible reception staff experience,"We stayed at Powerscourt Hotel for 4 nights over the Easter break with my husband and 2 daughters. Arriving early from the airport we were told at reception that our room was not yet ready - we had requested early check in due to being tired after long journey.

We asked if we could enjoy high tea while we wait. No - this requires an advance 24 hour reservation was the answer. I explained that this was not stated in their rules at time of booking the hotel and today is actually my significant birthday. No - it’s not possible. On third try we requested to speak with the hotel manager, she left to come back 5 mins that we were in luck and table was available. After waiting another 15 minutes we took matters into our own hands and wandered over to the restaurant.

To our surprise there were many free tables in the restaurant. We received a friendly and competent service. The high tea was well presented, scones soft and tea warm. Nothing earth shuttering but acceptable.

Once we finished we asked again if we could have our room - no still not ready we will let you know. We took the girls on bike tour to  Avoca shop to kill sometime - we returned 4 pm on the dot for check in to pick up the keys.

To our dismay,  room was still not ready no apology no one cared. We sat in the lobby watching numerous Irish families arrive for the 30 minutes all receiving their keys and checking in immediately. We again approached the front desk - we don’t know why your room is not ready.  The staff appeared annoyed at us that we dared to keep enquiring even though it was 40 minutes past check in and 3 hours since our arrival at the hotel at this point.

We were offered „upgrade” to a suite by a very annoyed unpleasant staff member - the room was downstairs, with no view and stone cold as it turned out with a heating system which was broken. Caretaker arrived offering an electric heater be brought in at which point we said no thank you - paying a small fortune to stay in this hotel and no proper heating we asked again for our room.

It took another 2 hours for our luggage to be moved, we wasted half a day checking in. My restaurant reservation for dinner was missing - hotel only operates 1 restaurant Sally Gap - the other closed the entire time except for breakfast.

We ended up having our joint birthday dinner (my 50th and my daughters 16th) by the bar at the entrance to restaurant despite there being great tables free inside….

What do we think of Powerscourt? Supposed to be pride of Dublin and premier resort in Ireland… Nicely maintained, clean, pretty setting but absolutely none of it mattered after the unpleasant careless treatment by the hotel staff. Maybe Powerscourt only welcomes local Irish guests with pleasure and the rest are tolerated it which is how it felt to us. In which case I recommend international tourist keep well away and find another hotel with warmer welcome.

Not recommended and Will not be coming back. Ever.",1,2024,06,03
217,Special hotel break,"Spectacular drive and entrance foyer to this beautiful hotel. Enjoyed two nights break in a fantastic room and had two first class breakfasts each morning comprising everything you’d expect from such a luxurious hotel. We ate dinner at both Sika restaurant and Sally Gap, the former being a special experience with the latter being less enjoyable due to a lot of noise and somewhat disorderly in service and quality.  Overall stay most enjoyable with a few minor issues which were attended to on our request..",5,2024,06,01
217,"A wonderful experience, though food doesn’t measure up to everything else","What a wonderful way to start our trip to Ireland/Scotland. The hotel is absolutely beautiful, on gorgeous grounds with amazing amenities, and the staff were always friendly and extremely helpful. Our room was sumptuous and comfortable, and the hotel is either walking distance or a short cab ride from lovely attractions like the Powerscourt Estate, Powerscourt Waterfall, or downtown Eniskerry.

The only drawback to the entire experience was the food, which simply isn’t up to the caliber of the rest of the hotel. The breakfast buffet was uninspiring for the price, and dinner at the Sally Gap – one of two on-site restaurants – was disappointing, including an expensive chateaubriand that was gristly and inedible.  My rating would have been an unequivocal 5 if it hadn’t been for the food. We had a much more enjoyable meal at the Enniskerry Inn downtown.

We would absolutely stay there again and recommend it highly – just be sure to find somewhere else to eat.",4,2024,06,01
217,Powerscourt is Absolutely Amazing!,"The hotel is beautiful, breathtaking!  If possible, try to get a room with a balcony.  
They have bottles of water at the front desk and I suggest picking one up when you return to the hotel so you have extra water in your room.  The breakfast is excellent - can't think of anything I would have wanted that was not on the buffet or menu.  We went of premises for lunch and dinner (although we had lunch today across the street at the Country Club - it was just what we would have assumed we could get at a country club - chicken wings, sandwiches, drinks.  The on-site restaurants are pricey and we always tend to eat offsite whenever we stay at hotels because we really want to spend time interacting with the locals.  The bed was really comfortable, pillows perfect.  I would highly suggest signing up for the ""Falconry"" experience.  It was amazing and the four of us enjoyed every minute.  The gardens are down the street and it was an easy walk.  Another must do if you are in the area.  I can't say enough about the staff here - they go out of their way to take care of whatever you may need.
Our two nights at this hotel were our first experience in Ireland and we were glad we chose to be here!",5,2024,05,31
217,Spectacular Hotel and Grounds,"The Powerscourt Hotel and surrounding property is spectacular and sits in the Wicklow Mountain foothills.  The surrounding property encompasses 1,000+ acres of lush countryside.  The gardens around the hotel are well manicured, include several fountains, and numerous flower gardens.  Hiking the immediate perimeter of the hotel is relaxing and scenic.  The property includes two (2) 18 hole golf courses, a large botanical garden, a distillery, the Powerscourt Mansion, along with several other outbuildings.  There is also a waterfall on the property.   Back to the main Powerscourt Hotel.  We staying in a King Suite accommodation comprised of four (4) separate rooms; king-size bedroom, living room (with desk, couch, large overstuffed chair, and television), large dressing room, and a very large bathroom (separate shower and bathtub area).  Each room was tastefully decorated.  Breakfast each morning was delicious with a choice of buffet/ individually cooked breakfast or combination of both.  Dinner was well presented, great service, and again delicious.  We also partook of afternoon tea which was both entertaining and delicious.  My wife and sister utilized the spa facilities, while us guys took in a round of golf at the European Club. 
Our objective in staying at the Powerscourt Hotel was to relax for 3 days prior to our return trip to the United States.  Mission Accomplished.  For those considering a visit, go ahead and pamper yourself.  The hotel is spectacular.",5,2024,05,31
217,Wonderful & Unique anniversary experience,"Everything was amazing! It was our 10 years anniversary and all the staff was so nice, professional, helpful and made us a few surprises that made our celebration unique! We loved every detail, from the suite, to dinner, breakfast, afternoon tea and the spa! Would def recommend this hotel and will come back for sure! :)",5,2024,05,31
217,Beyond expectations,"What can I say!
 
This month we had the most amazing visit to Powerscourt Hotel. It has been on my list for a while. I’m used to travelling and staying in fab hotels, but this trumps the lot!
And I tell you what wins the day – the people who work there. From the moment we arrived, we had a little joke with the doorman and pointed us in the direction of check in.
We arrived early to take full advantage of the unusually warm May day! I was so surprised to be offered an early check in without even asking, as by now my travel companion was already sat outside on the terrace ordering the wine! I went down to join her with room key in hand, baggage whisked off by yet another delightful member of the Powerscourt team.
 
We were honestly treated like longtime returning guests, a busy terrace but a beautiful feel of friends/families enjoying a rare chance to unwind. The gardens stunning and I kept getting distracted by the chess board! If only I could play chess!
 
We returned to the room as I had a reservation for dinner in the Grill bar, now when I say room-  this is the biggest understatement known to man, on opening the door I gasped! We had the most stunning suite on the ground floor overlooking the gardens, with floor to ceiling windows, when I mean I felt I had been transported to an age gone by – I really mean it. I have stayed in some beautiful suites/rooms but this one just blew us both away.
 
We obviously had champagne just because, and because it was one of our special birthdays – a cupcake was left with a beautiful card – it’s my birthday next month and I wish this one was for me! If that was the sneak peak of the afternoon tea delights, that will be next on the agenda for my return visit.
 
We got ready for dinner as we had a spa reservation made the following afternoon for treatments and the R+R!
Dinner was fabulous, the waitress  (I wish I knew her name) – was so attentive, although she was incredibly busy, we were absolutely brilliantly taken care of.
 
The next morning breakfast was wonderful, seated to a wonderful table in the window. Fab coffee was served within minutes of being seated, although a popular breakfast time – spoilt for choice, you would have to be incredibly fussy to not enjoy the offerings. The Pancakes made to order, to die for!
 
Headed to the SPA for an afternoon of pampering – again, a hidden oasis, massages super.
Before leaving Powerscourt we borrowed a couple of the bikes, well- I’ve not been on a bike in over 20 years and great fun, it was a lovely opportunity to explore the extended gardens which Powerscourt is nestled within.
 

A memory made, which was beyond needed and will be so cherished. You can’t put a price on a feeling, Powerscourt is right up there and surpassed my expectations on every single level. A building may be beautiful, it is the team that demonstrated a great sense of pride and professionalism is what makes this place world class.
 
Thank you so much for the memory.",5,2024,05,29
217,An outstanding experience.,"My wife and I had an outstanding stay in Powerscourt last week. I can't speak highly enough of the location and the hotel, but also of the staff who could not have been more professional and welcoming. This was our best hotel stay in many years.",5,2024,05,28
217,AMAZING stay at Powerscourt,"Had an amazing time at Powerscourt. Outstanding from start to finish, great staff, incredible food and a beautiful view. They really go above and beyond to create an amazing experience for guests. The hotel itself is also stunning, can’t wait to go back.",5,2024,05,28
217,"An amazing experience, don't miss out!","Myself and my wife got married the day of our stay here. It was an intimate affair with just ourselves and immediate family. We were absolutely blown away when we arrived. The grounds and lobby were breathtaking. After checking in we went straight to the main grounds with our photographer. We are so excited to see the photos because the grounds and stunning Wicklow mountains in the background provided the perfect setting for them. We stayed in a Classic Deluxe suite with a mountain view. I have stayed in hotels all over the world, every continent and this has to be the best. The rooms were huge, beautiful decor, spotless clean and fantastic shower and bath. A beautiful touch were the rose petals and swan heart towels on the bed to celebrate our honeymoon. We also added on chocolate strawberries to the booking, absolutely delicious. After the photos were done, we had drinks out on the Sika restaurant balcony overlooking the beautiful grounds. The drinks menu was excellent, with some delicious cocktails and fine wines. We booked a package called 'Tje dining experience which included a night stay, 5 course dinner and breakfast. That night we dined at the Sika Restaurant. Several of my friends and work colleagues highly recommended it but it went far above my expectations. The staff were lovely and the food was exceptional. They even catered for my brother who is Vegan and he absolutely loved it. We continued the celebrations in the residents bar after the meal where there was a piano. We joined in with some other guests in a sing song around the piano until late. I must say a big thank you to the staff for putting up with our celebrations. The next morning we had breakfast in bed, myself and my wife both had the eggs Benedict, absolutely delicious. My mother booked in for a spa treatment that morning, she said it was the best she ever had. Also my Father went for a swim in the pool the next morning and said the facilities were fantastic. I honestly would have paid for another night the next morning but we had our honeymoon the next day. I could go on for hours, we all had such an amazing stay at the hotel and it honestly made our wedding day. We will be back, without a doubt 😃",5,2024,05,28
217,A 70th Birthday celebration in Powerscourt Hotel,"As I was celebrating my 70th birthday, my family and I went to the Powerscourt Hotel on Sunday May 12th to have a celebration dinner and then my wife and I stayed overnight to continue the celebration into the next day. It was a short but very memorable experience and we enjoyed it thoroughly. The hotel is magnificent and on arrival we were met at the entrance by a very nice gentleman who took our luggage and directed us to the reception where we booked in.
The room we had was gorgeous with patio doors to the outside terrace overlooking the magnificent gardens and Wicklow mountains. We were thrilled with it.
Dinner in the Sika restaurant was amazing with everyone impressed with the quality of the food. I had Duck Breasts which were delicious. The serving staff were exceptionally friendly and looked after our every need -including  my 9 year old grandson who was with us.
It was our first visit to Powerscourt Hotel and it wont be the last. A hotel of this quality in magnificent surroundings is only bettered by its very friendly staff who made our visit more memorable.
I really cant thank them enough for making our celebrations and stay delightful.",5,2024,05,23
217,"Featherlite scones, juicy unset raspberry jam and clotted cream - for breakfast! Sheer Genius","We were on a road trip, and, unknowingly, started with the best first. Powerscourt Hotel, just south of Dublin.
Everything else after that was lovely, this is Ireland after all, but oh my goodness - we should have put Powerscourt last on our itinerary to go out on a perfect high.
There’s so much to say, no review could really do it justice, you just absolutely have to go.
I’ll do my best though, to outline what made it so very special for us.
The magnificent setting near the Wicklow mountains and adjacent Powerscourt house with its highly awarded gardens are a draw, and the gardens of the hotel itself are stunning. We spent a happy afternoon wandering through the mature acres in the Japanese Garden, the Italian and walled gardens of Powerscourt House. We really wished that we had allocated more time here instead of just 2 nights - anyone who loves gardens, walking and the other activities offered by the hotel could easily spend a longer time here.
We had a great day touring the Wicklow mountains, the countryside is so beautiful, and it was pure luxury to come home to our sumptuous bedroom. The bed and bed linens were first class ( I am very picky about linens) and the room was lovely, spacious and well appointed.
The hotel is beautiful, just go and admire.
And so to those scones. Reader, if I could have found the person who made those scones I would have married them! All the food we had here was great, but we don’t often indulge in afternoon tea these days and I do miss a good scone and these were exactly how they should be made. Scones at breakfast? Who knew? Sheer Genius.
Last, but absolutely not least, and, in fact, first - the staff. They are the beating heart of this wonderful place, front and centre of a seamless service, and so genuinely lovely. They made us feel welcome and valued. They were such a wonderful team that I won’t pick out just a few, they all deserve praise. They are a credit to management who are able to inspire that spirit. Thank you all x
As I said, just go, you won’t be disappointed.",5,2024,05,17
217,A must stay place in Ireland.,"Each time we visit Ireland we end the trip with a stay in Powerscourt.  It is our favorite place to stay while over there, and one of our favorite Marriott properties.  From the moment you step inside, there is a sense of calm and tranquility. The staff are amazing from the front desk and doorman to the wait staff. The oversized rooms are wonderful, and the bathrooms and dressing rooms are huge. We had dinner at Sika restaurant and were blown away by how amazing it was. There is no other bread that can hold up to their mini Guinness loaves either.  We will definitely return, actually planning to return just to stay here for a long weekend.  Location is tranquil and the views are breathtaking.",5,2024,05,16
217,Pure relaxation,"Best thing about hotel is staff very friendly and always there for you, the hotel itself is beautiful and the scenery is just breathtaking, relaxing is second nature to this hotel, the spa is wonderful I treated my wife to a lovely massage while I was at the pool relaxing, they have a special room with a spectacular view for chilling out in silence, with really comfy electric chair/ bed amazing, the food and wine service from waiters to management in restaurant is special, 10 out 10 for quality.
We will certainly be coming back for another night.",5,2024,05,13
217,Definitely will be back,"We stayed at the Powerscourt Hotel for one night and it is such a relaxing and beautiful hotel. The drive up to the hotel, the reception, the Concierge, the room and the service were excellent. The room had everything you could need and the bed was so comfortable we definitely will go back to stay.",5,2024,05,09
217,5-star property with great service,"Everything was almost perfect at this wonderful hotel.

The location: driving in to the property is quite breathtaking (especially if the weather is good).

On-site golf course with two 18 hole courses that were in great condition and a lot of fun to play!!

The hotel: rooms were finished to an exceptional level of quality and were supremely comfortable. Breakfast is extensive and great quality.

Staff: I found that during my stay anything i asked to staff was never too much trouble. It's expensive but with that comes a great willingness from staff to ensure customer satisfaction and no penny pinching.
If only it was not an Autograph brand and had a nice Club Lounge :)

This is one of the best hotel stays I have had in recent years; and I highly recommend for a luxury trip.",5,2024,05,09
217,Amazing stay,5 star from start to finish. The John the concierge was amazing with his advice and assistance. Highly recommend using the hotel bicycles and getting out to see the grounds. Food was excellent in the sugar loaf. Breakfast was an impressive spread to suit every taste,5,2024,05,08
217,Escape to the country,"I booked this hotel as a very special getaway for my husband who has recently completed treatment for cancer. We live not too far away and I wanted somewhere easy to get too but away from the hustle and bustle of everyday life and boy where we in for a treat . 
From the extremely friendly welcome we received from staff at reception, to the amazement at the size of our room which was a classic deluxe guest room. We felt like we were on our own in the hotel it was so peaceful. 
Dinner in the Sally Gap Bar was incredible - the staff were so pleasant . The food was 10/10 and atmosphere was just so nice .
This would have been our first night out together in maybe 10 months so we were slightly nervous obviously with cleanliness and crowds but I could not fault the hotel at all - the place was absolutely spotless and we felt so safe . 
We had a number of walks around the gardens which were immaculate and it was just so wonderful.
Breakfast the next morning was again a treat . From the local honey, pastries , cooked Irish breakfasts , fresh fruits , the list is endless . There was also a separate menu which you could orders a range of other breakfast items . Again staff were so pleasant and helpful. 
We didn’t want to leave but promised we will definitely return again real soon .",5,2024,05,06
217,We didn’t want to leave,"We went all out and booked 2 nights in Powerscourt Hotel to celebrate our wedding anniversary, and we honestly couldn’t have asked for a more ideal place to unwind and escape from it all. From the moment we checked in, we were blown away by the obvious luxury but also all the small details that made the weekend so memorable. 
Our room, a Mountain View suite, was immaculate, and we’ll never forget that feeling walking in to it and taking in the sheer size and decadence of it. The bed was incredibly comfortable too, and we had a full 10 hours sleep, best sleep in a very long time! It’s so peaceful and tranquil, impossible not to relax. And that balcony, I can think of few nicer places to enjoy a coffee (see photo attached!)
The staff were wonderful, every single member of staff we encountered was approachable, friendly, smiling…there was a real sense of teamwork and pride. 

I could go on…

Suffice to say, at check out we booked to return in July, which we have never done on leaving a hotel before! That’s testament to how much we enjoyed our stay.",5,2024,05,03
217,Good to be back!,"We visited Powerscourt hotel for the first time in 4 years. (Covid, of course, took care of at least 2 of those years!) We were regulars and in 2021 and in early 2022 had encountered a quite a few things which we found problematic. However, we do love the hotel and its location so decided to give it another go. 
We are very pleased we did. 
What makes an hotel is the staff and their training, in our opinion. 
So, happily, we can report that we encountered some very lovely and helpful staff members. 
At reception, Mikaela and Chipriano (excuse my spelling of both first names) were fantastic! Above and beyond. 
Luca was a porter who was also lovely. Tatu also. 
All other waiters and bar staff were very good. 
We ate in the Sika restaurant the first evening and met a beautiful young French girl called Eva. Excellent at her job and great fun too. Food was excellent. The steak literally fell apart. Duck lovely. Everything was excellent. 
Breakfasts very good. 
Last night we dined with a friend in The Sally Gap restaurant. 
Our meal was great here too. But what made our time in the restaurant was a young waitress called Lucy. (23 blonde with glasses! Just in case you have multiple Lucys!) She has an extraordinary sense of humour very much in line with our own. She was very good at her job, of course, but she made our evening with her chat and effusive personality. We love a little bit of a laugh and relaxed staff…but we also observed her being more ‘formal’ with other guests. Her ability to ‘read the room/customer’ was extraordinary. Thank you, Lucy for a brilliant evening. 
We really enjoyed our stay and now this hotel is very much back on our radar and we will return to making it a regular on our places to stay! 
Well done to the new managers and those high up the chain of command for assuring that your staff are much better prepared and trained. Until we meet again.",4,2024,05,02
217,Amazing! The perfect place to unwind,"This is a special place! And I must say, it met and then exceeded all expectations. 

The staff are warm, welcoming and professional and make you feel like a VIP throughout the stay. The grounds are out of this world and food amazing.

Powerscourt is truly one of those exceptional hotels. If you get the opportunity to stay here, I say take it and enjoy. You wont be disappointed.",5,2024,04,30
217,"True meaning of ""The wow factor""","2 nights of luxury at your fabulous hotel!! Such friendly staff on arrival set the tone for our most enjoyable stay... Winnie, Mikaela and Tatu, to mention just a few. Our room, more like a suite was perfect, decor muted tones, Queen bed essence of comfort, Espa toiletries all the amenities needed (maybe a central light in the bedroom area.... and just to be picky, turndown treat 🥰)!!!... Relaxed in The Spa Area before dining  in the evening in the Sally Gap Brasserie, casual dining at its best, breakfast in The Sika Restaurant spectacular buffet, continental and hot food. The Powerscourt well deserves its accolades 🌟.",5,2024,04,29
217,Total 5 star experience!,"Powerscourt Hotel is in a magnificently beautiful setting.  The staff throughout our experience were professional, helpful, friendly and welcoming.  We were upgraded to a suite (thank you!) which was magnificent! Huge balcony with a splendid view of the beautiful grounds and the Sugar Loaf mountain.  The bed was exceptionally comfortable and the large bathroom was totally luxurious complete with heated floor.  We spent the day in the lovely spa with lunch, delicious, and had superb, relaxing spa treatments, highly recommend a massage and facial.  We dined in the Sika restaurant. Absolutely delicious food served by brilliant staff.  Afterwards we went to the bar featuring live music.  Lovely atmosphere and again we had superb staff.  Breakfast in Sika restaurant the next morning was again fabulous with plenty of selection. This was a total five star experience throughout our stay! Loved it. Thank you.  I am only sorry we couldn't stay longer!",5,2024,04,29

217,The most amazing hotel,"Our stay in Powerscourt was magical! We were celebrating our 1 month wedding anniversary and we really wanted to go somewhere special, so it had to be Powerscourt. We’ve always wanted to go there and had heard such amazing things about the hotel, and it definitely lived up to our expectations. 
From the moment we arrived, we were treated so well. We were given an early check in and we were also upgraded to a suite. When we arrived at our stunning suite, the hotel had a gorgeous celebration plate and really thoughtful card for us. The card itself had such beautiful words written in it, we were really touched.
We then headed to the spa where we both got amazing head, shoulder and back massages. The thermal suites were stunning, with an amazing view.
We were blown away when we saw the pool, it was amazing. After we had spent more time in the jacuzzi, steam room and sauna, we went for a walk around the grounds, which are absolutely stunning. We then went for a drink in the Sally Gap bar, which we loved!
We got ready for dinner and headed back to the Sally Gap bar, where we were served by Ivan. Ivan was amazing, and so helpful. As I was walking in I noticed another guest was having a really appetising meal and I asked Ivan to help me find it on the menu and he couldn’t have been more helpful. They made me a pĩna colada, although it wasn’t on the menu. Ivan asked us if we were celebrating a special occasion and when we told him that we were, he brought out a celebration plate with 2 glasses of Prosecco! We were so touched that he thought of us. The food was absolutely divine! Afterwards we listened to the the live music in the bar, which ended the night perfectly! The next morning we had the most beautiful breakfast. We couldn’t get over how stunning the Sika room was. 
Every single thing about our stay was magnificent! We are so glad that we picked Powerscourt to celebrate after our wedding, it was the perfect trip. We’ll be back!",5,2024,04,25
217,Excellent from start to finish,"This was a brilliant experience from start to finish. All of the staff were very welcoming and helpful. We had booked the distillery whiskey and food pairing tour, which was really well worth doing. The guide was really knowledgeable and the food and whiskey were excellent (especially the 18 year!). Then on check-in, we were lucky enough to get a room upgrade to a beautiful suite. We went down to the pool and jacuzzi, just in time for the kids to have left (we were on a rare night away from our own kids!) so it was a really relaxing experience. Then up to the Sika restaurant for a really lovely meal and an excellent bottle of wine. The bar that night and the breakfast the next morning were also excellent and throughout the stay, all of our interactions with the staff of the hotel were very pleasant experiences. We finished off with a stroll around the grounds, then a drink out on the terrace and some shopping in Avoca before heading home. We were lucky that it was the first sunny weekend of the year but I think we would still have enjoyed it even if the weather was bad.",5,2024,04,24
217,Everything is 5 star,"Everything  about this hotel  is 5 star..its like stepping off the world and being immersed  in luxury and tranquility where their incredible team of staff seem to anticipate your every need. Food ,service,comfort views,rooms  bathrooms all 5 star .A great place to recharge and sooth your soul.",5,2024,04,23
217,Fantastic stay and near Dublin,"Really nice hotel where all staff members smile and say hello. Got upgraded to a suite when we booked in!!! Biggest bed I have ever been in with all the room amenities you could ask for. We were only there for a night so we had dinner in the main Sika restaurant. Fantastic 5 course with excellent service, shout out to Eve who was our server, breakfast the next day was equally as good with anything you could really ask for.",5,2024,04,23
217,Perfect spa 24-hour get away,"This hotel was perfect for a recent reunion with a girlfriend.  We meet twice a year and this hotel has everything you could hope for to enjoy a 24 hour trip; amazing spa and massage, big room with a view, gorgeous healthy food with different restaurant options (both casual and fine dining). The staff were all so friendly and attentive that it creates a lovely vibe to relax and enjoy the time. Thank-you! Highly recommended to get away from it all.",5,2024,04,23
217,A hotel that clicks all of the boxes.,"We had a very enjoyable stay in Powerscourt.
From the most amazing room with such a comfortable bed. Best nights sleep I’ve had in a long time.
We ate in the Grill Bar and food was exceptional.
The staff are incredible. They go out of their way to help.
Our only problem was we could only stay 1 night. Hopefully we will be able to return again and have more time to explore the gardens and spa.",5,2024,04,23
217,Two day getaway to relax,"Absolutely wonderful hotel and so beautiful and the cleanliness of the hotel and our room was first class. A wonderful place to relax and unwind . All the staff were extremely helpful, friendly and polite . The breakfast  was so delicious and lots of variety and we had a meal in the Sally Gap one evening which was gorgeous and our server Aoife Lau was so attentive and helpful. We will definitely be returning again and looking forward to our next stay .",5,2024,04,21
217,An Exceptional Property in a Unique Location!,"We chose to treat ourselves to 50th Wedding Anniversary night and dinner at the resort. The grounds and hotel setting is very special and has a wow factor on arrival. All the staff at every level were friendly and helpful. Our upgraded balcony “mini suite” was excellent. Spacious, high quality and exceptionally presented with. sumptuous super king sealy bed! Nice to have a separate shower cubicle. The Spa / pool was a delight with steam room and sauna. All this at a very reasonable price for a quality 5 star hotel.
Our only disappointment was the Sika restaurant food The setting, atmosphere and staff were excellent but the style and presentation of the dishes was not what we expected. The soup was cold, the ravioli was tiny cold and tasteless. The beef was only three small cubes of tough teak and my lamb was a very small portion served in a very unusual style and luke warm.

All that said, we had an exceptional stay in this first class property in a unique location and the welcome and friendliness of the staff made our short stay a success. 
We will most definitely return and give the Sika another go but maybe the Brasserie (which looked fabulous) might be a better choice. 

The hotel is a credit to the owner and management team but please have a think about the Sika food style.",5,2024,04,19
217,Superb stay with the friendliest of staff. We will be back,"On booking, I mentioned that it was our 40th wedding anniversary. On arrival, we were delighted to receive a complimentary upgrade. The hotel staff could not be nicer. We enjoyed our stay so much that we tried to book an extra night but unfortunately there was no availability. The hotel was spotlessly clean. We dined in the Sika restaurant and also in the bar. Both excellent. Lovely grounds, complimentary bicycles and complimentary shuttle bus into Enniskerry. All in all a truly 5 star experience for us.",5,2024,04,17
217,Hannah + Eamon engagement,"What a fabulous hotel! The grounds around powerscourt is picturesque, we arrived to the gardens for breakfast in Avoca at 0930. My partner and I then made our way to the waterfall where we got engaged. After this he surprised me with a stay at the hotel, I was amazed by the warm welcome at reception. From there the team upgraded our room, gave us champagne to celebrate and even some desserts that said congratulations. Everything was so perfect. We had an excellent view of sugerloaf mountain from our private balcony where we sat and contacted friends and family about the news. We then went to relax in the spa, it was the most beautiful area with steam room, sauna and blacked out swimming pool/jacuzzi. The dinner that evening was 10/10, the breakfast in the morning was also fabulous. I would absolutely love to return to this hotel where we celebrated our special day, and just want to thank the staff at powerscourt again for their hospitality",5,2024,04,16
217,Beautiful stay,Exceptional stay at Powerscourt surrounded by beautiful scenery. Something for every age. Amazing food and service. Ideal stay with lots to do around the grounds from visiting the garden to seeing the spectacular waterfall. Really enjoyable stay.,5,2024,04,12
217,Fantastic staff and a fantastic hotel.,"A truly wonderful stay. The environment of the Hotel, room and grounds are absolutely first rate, but the staff just make the experience so unique. At check in, Michaela on reception during check in was just so friendly and went above and beyond to check everything was in order and we had what we needed. Aoife in the Sika (breakfast) was a credit and we both noted that she just kept an eye out for us and in a gentle and genuine way checked all was in order. Not often I leave a hotel and actually want to note staff names to make a point of giving thanks.
That’s what makes a Powerscourt more than just a hotel and the reason we look forward to returning soonest.",5,2024,04,10
217,Beautiful hotel situated in Wicklow with stunning views.,"My daughter and I had a fabulous two night stay here over the Easter weekend. Powerscourt hotel is absolutely beautiful.  I honestly can’t compliment the staff enough, every single staff member was so friendly and helpful (which is hard to find these days) and all the staff were so happy.  The suite we stayed in was beautiful,  really clean and very comfortable, the bed was amazing best 2 nights sleep I’ve had in a long time, I wanted to bring the bed home with me!  
  We dined in The Sika restaurant and  the food was second to none.  The presentation was beautiful but omg everything tasted delicious, I had the asparagus soup which was amazing then I had the duck entree which was cooked to perfection and absolutely delicious. I honestly rate that meal as the best I’ve ever had and my husbands a chef..  Hope he doesn’t read this!!  Breakfast was wonderful there was so much to choose from and everything was really good.  We had a fabulous weekend and I hope to come back and stay again.  Thank you to all the staff.

217,"Peaceful, excellent service, food amazing, views and grounds breathtaking","I booked a two night stay for myself and my husband as a suprise for his birthday. There was. Slight glitch with the room at first but was quickly rectified by the manager. All the staff are very professional and could not do enough for us. We dined in the Sika restaurant and The Sally Gap restaurant the food , service atmosphere was exquisite. At breakfast there was such a wide variety. The grounds and views are spectacular.",5,2024,04,08
217,My simple 36th  birthday celebration,"Powerscourt Hotel made my  36th birthday special. I appreciate the birthday card,  the celebration cake and the chocolates prepared for me. It was placed nicely and artistically. 
We came early so the room is not yet ready but the staffs are very accomodating, took our luggages and belongings and kept it with them. While waiting we ate in Sally Restaurant. We ordered haddock, steak, and sally cheesecake. We love them all! When the room is ready they called us for check in and our belongings where already in the room. The room are spacious! The views from the terrace are magnificent. The bed is soft and comfortable so we sleep very well! Their shower is lovely and I love the smell of the shower gel, shampoo, conditioner and soap... It's bergamot ang jasmine so it's  refreshing and so natural. We also avail the ESPA Swedish massage for 1 hour. Their spa facilities are huge and offers alot from thermal suite, sauna, serenity room and pool.  I love all of them. Massage is highly recommended because I feel so relax after and had a good long sleep afterwards. Their brrakfast  is included in our stay. It's a buffet breakfast so we have a variety of meals to choose like bread, croissants, sweets, cornflakes, porridge, yogurt, sausages, fruits, mushroom, toast, pancakes,coffee, tea, juices, etc. 

It is also near Powerscourt Falls and Garden so we were able to stroll them. We are lucky for the lovely weather during our stay. I enjoy our short vacation and will definitely come back ❤️",5,2024,04,06
217,A stay we will never forget ❤️,"We recently stayed in Powerscourt for the Easter bank holiday weekend for a special birthday and the stay was as close to perfect as it could get. Shauna organised a room upgrade for the occasion which made us feel extremely welcome before we even got there.
Zoe then went above and beyond to sort out our dinner reservations in Sika restaurant the week before our stay. When we arrived, Luca kindly brought our bags to our room and offered to park our car for us! The food in Sika was completely faultless and the staff were extremely accommodating to a food allergy that I had. We got up early the next morning for a relaxing swim and then headed back to Sika for another perfect meal at breakfast. The attention to detail and atmosphere in Powerscourt is something I will never forget and will forever use this to compare to other hotels I stay in in the future. It is a standard that all hotels should look up to. Can’t wait to go back!",5,2024,04,06
217,Great family break,"We made a last minute booking for Easter as our original Portugal plans didn’t go ahead due to the weather there. The staff were extremely accommodating with organising a big enough room to have two kids under two with cots etc. There was loads of activities and the atmosphere was great! Have been a few times but definitely an amazing all round hotel, would recommend to anyone. And looking forward to getting back!",5,2024,04,05
217,Would highly recommend Powerscourt Hotel,"It was my family’s first time visiting Ireland and I am SO HAPPY we chose the Powerscourt to host us. First, what a beautiful hotel and garden. From the moment we pulled in we had a gentleman named Luca rush to get all of our bags and help us and even parked our car. When he was finished he brought all of our luggage up to our room while giving us local suggestions and reminded us they offer complimentary rides to and from the enniksary Inn for dinner. 

On our second day our daughter got to enjoy a beautiful Easter egg hunt followed by complimentary ice cream. We enjoyed the pool with our daughter from 3-6! 

Sika/Sally Gap- let me start off by saying the tortellini starter in Sika blew my mind. The food at Sika was 10/10. We enjoyed the sally gap as well nice chicken fingers and fries for kids- my husband also remarked it was one of the best whiskey sours he has had. 

I also want to make a note of the manager on duty, I didn’t catch his name but everytime we saw him he always made sure to come over to us have a conversation and the next time we saw him he would remember us as ask about how we enjoyed what we were doing that day. The amount of people he must deal with on a regular basis and to remember our family reallly made that 5star experience 

Overall all I can say is this is by far one of our family’s new favorite hotels, and we feel so blessed to have visited. 

Thank you Powerscourt- The Kunkle’s",5,2024,04,04
217,Out of this world!,"This hotel never fails to amaze me. We have stayed a number of times and I just love it. It definitely is a 5 star experience when it comes to excellent service, friendly staff, cleanliness, food, drinks and ambiance. 
I have stayed in numerous 5 star hotels and this one beats them all.
The location is ideal, you can decide to stay in this fabulous  hotel for all of your stay or venture out to the village, Avoca, Powerscourt gardens/waterfall and all the other beautiful amenities. 
I definitely will be returning!",5,2024,04,03
217,5 star hotel but 2 star experience.,"We checked in for the Easter bank holiday and were meant to be “checked in” by 11 am, we arrived even 30 min lates but there was a delay in our room and the rest of the guests because the lobby/lounge area looked like a busy mess. After 2 hours waiting we finally were able to go into the room. 

As we were waiting for the room we sat down and had a coffee and overheard (not intentionally) one of the staff being rude and condescending to another staff about said person not having critical thinking skill. Which to be honest, no paying customer needs to hear such conversations but it was voiced for everyone around to hear. It is very off putting. 

Too many kids and too many “kids hours” in the thermal suit. Specially if you don’t have any kids yourself and wish to relax, definitely not the place. Besides that, I am not sure what the chlorine level is in that pool, but whatever it is, it is not healthy because I have gotten a contact dermatitis since. 

As well, no appointments available in the spa. Apparently booked out for days but the hotel wasn’t at max capacity either. (?)

My stars are for the staff/food at sika/the sally gap who were lovely and the food was tasty. And the location/views. The only experience worth something. The room itself was lovely, but to spend 2 hours to try to check in and waiting around you would think flowers and chocolates were left in the room.",2,2024,04,03
217,The BEST Easter Break! - A true 5-star experience!,"Booked two days staycation for our little Easter Break with our little one. We had an absolutely fantastic time during our entire stay! 

Every single team member that we have encountered was so friendly and professional! Especially to Mossy and John from Concierge, Anna and Melvin from Front Office, The manager (Ivan, apologies if I spelled it wrong) from The Sally Gap Bar, nothing is too much trouble for them and their customer service are beyond 5 star!
 
We cannot express enough how impressed we were! From the lovely smiles and greetings at the door and the reception, to the high quality and delicious food at the bistro and the breakfast buffet (We can clearly see how much efforts that the Chefs have put into). From the cosiness and high standard of cleanness of our rooms and the swimming pool and spa, to all the activities that hotel has offered to the kids!

The Egg Hunting in the hotel garden, the complimentary Ice-Cream and Popcorns for the kids, plus the Game Room and the Face Painting, and the complimentary bicycles renting and the access to the River Walk! All of those were so thoughtful and beyond our expectations! Huge thanks to everyone at  the Powescourt to make our trip so magical and wonderful!",5,2024,04,02
217,Sally Gap Bar & Grill - Never again,"While the food was of a reasonable standard, there was an awful delay with food service and unfortunately surrounding tables were the same with many strong complaints - it became a joke. I had called the hotel the day previously to see if I could change the booking from 1.30pm to 1.00pm but was told it was not possible as it was completely booked out, despite there being very few people there which is mind boggling as everything was so slow. We chose the bar & grill over Sika as it was to mark a relative’s 80th and Easter Sunday we wanted to be in and out with little fuss, but it was quite the opposite. A really disappointing affair. Will not be going back to dine, despite recent pleasant stays.",1,2024,03,31
217,Fantastic stay,"I stayed at the Powerscourt on St Patrick’s day weekend and it was an amazing experience! As soon as we arrived Jean on reception was so helpful and explained everything we needed to know, Luca was great and super friendly and showed us how to get to the nearby gardens which are a must visit! We had a beautiful room with a stunning view  ,definitely the nicest room I’ve ever stayed in. 
The coffees , made by Ash and Elliot both days were so lovely and our food at the Sally Gap was exceptional! Our service from Rita was fantastic and I had the nicest burger I’ve ever had. Highly recommend for lunch or dinner. 
Overall , all of the staff were so helpful and friendly , the food and atmosphere was outstanding and I can’t wait to come back",5,2024,03,30
217,Treat yourself and stay at the Powerscourt Hotel,"Situated in Bray near the highly underrated Enniskerry you can find the Powerscourt Hotel.  Away from the city, in the winding hills lies a gem of a hotel.  The property boasts vast, breath-taking, sweeping views and the hotel itself has magnificently elegant appointments.  With the feel of an exclusive castle far away from the hubbub of every day life, you are in fact just mere miles from city activities, country bliss and coastal experiences.  

We arrived to an amazingly young, ambitious and friendly staff who immediately took our bags and our car, and swept us to the desk where we were welcomed with warmth, and informed of our opportunities ahead.  The staff was efficient, kind and absolutely warm and amazing.  We indulged in late night in-room dining, and it did not disappoint, nor did the friendly wait-staff.  We thoroughly enjoyed the balcony, eating breakfast outside on a crisp morning, through the afternoon rain and into the evening's gentle breeze.  

We ventured into Enniskerry for baked goods, coffee and local conversation.  We found wonderful take out in Bray where we walked along the shore, and we were a beautiful ride straight to the west coast of Galway.   

This is our new favorite property and we can't wait to return.",5,2024,03,29
217,Absolutely stunningly breathtaking,"My husband and I booked here for our 1 year wedding anniversary as we wanted to treat ourselves to somewhere very special to mark the occasion. When we arrived we checked in and were absolutely over the moon to learn we had been upgraded to a suite!! We could not believe it as this kind of thing never usually happens to us. The staff at reception were exceptionally helpful and couldn’t have done enough for us. When we arrived to our room we were in absolute awww at how stunning it was. We felt super grateful. The view from our room was breathtaking! The bed, the pillows the bathroom- everything was a 10/10. We ate in the sally gap restaurant and food was exquisite. The staff were friendly which is always a plus. We were made to feel special from the start of our stay to the end of our stay. We both agree, without a doubt , we will be back. Management at Powerscourt should be very proud of both themselves and their staff as they are doing an excellent job. Thank you for making our 1 year anniversary an extremely memorable and special one❤️",5,2024,03,29
217,Weekend break in stunning hotel,"Stunning weekend stay at Powerscourt. Beautiful hotel in a lovely mountain setting yet close to Dublin. Pool was lovely, walks stunning, bikes available for a cycle. We ate in the sally gap bar which is more gastro pub than a bar, lovely decor and seating. The food was excellent.",5,2024,03,26
217,PERFECTION!,"PERFECTION!!! Relax in opulence & elegance, surrounded by an abundance of beautifully curated gardens, while being tended to by the most warm and welcoming staff: it gets no better than a stay at the Powerscourt Hotel! From the moment you arrive, you feel as though you are the most important guest on their list, even when you’re traveling solo, as I was. Every detail of the hotel is perfectly tended to, and every member of their team is there to offer a warm smile and assist with your every need. I would be remiss if I did not mention Mossy, who is your go-to concierge: he’s always on the floor (not sitting arrogantly behind a desk), ensuring your questions are answered, helping to arrange itineraries or suggesting how your stay can be elevated by the hotels many offerings. It is a perfect retreat for singles, couples and also families! 

If you are looking for a relaxing stay where you are made to feel like royalty by the hotel’s team as well as the surroundings, look no further! It cannot be done any better than it is at Powerscourt!",5,2024,03,21
217,Highly recommended,"We had a wonderful stay at Powerscourt Hotel. From the moment we arrived we knew we had the made the right choice. 
Our room was beautiful, well decorated and spacious. We had lovely views from the balcony also. The bed was super comfy and pillows were perfect. 
We ate in the Sally Gap Bar and Brasserie for lunch and dinner and on both occasions the food was delicious and service was excellent. We had drinks in the bar after which had a really good atmosphere. 
Following morning we got room service and the breakfast was delicious and we were well catered for! 
After we used the spa area, lockers rooms were very clean and maintained well throughout. The pool area is really nice. Really enjoyed our swim, pool area is top class with loungers to sit back and relax also. 
Overall a wonderful stay and definitely recommended.",5,2024,03,19
217,Difficult to Fault - But wont be back,"Beautiful location. Excellent staff. Food in the Sika restaurant top class. Lovely room (issues with Chromecast, the movie package choices normally €12-13 was really poor and my wifes perennial complaint about hair dryers and acces to a mirror/socket without having to move furniture reinforced here!) Problem is that with the gardens and waterfall all close and the location being popular the hotel gets too busy with passing visitors inside the Atrium Lounge and Bar so not quite the 5 star experience we had hoped for.",3,2024,03,18
217,⭐️⭐️⭐️,"Went to check out for a possible venue for our wedding, stayed two nights. It was also our 1 year engagement anniversary and my birthday. Lovely place and most of the staff are brilliant . The reception staff sadly let the place down so didn’t start our trip on a positive note. Rooms are stunning and food good too. Asked for an upgrade as you do and were told they don’t do complimentary upgrades which is fair, but at dinner the second evening another couple advised us they asked too and got it granted lol. We were a little disappointed. Based on our experience we won’t be having our wedding here but we would stay again for another occasion.",1,2024,03,17
217,A great treat would have loved to stay longer,Stayed one night in 5 star powerscourt hotel on Mother’s Day lovely treat we were up graded to a beautiful room with balcony I had a voucher from my sister for my birthday and retirement for day of calm in the spa so I had light lunch (it was a light afternoon tea ) then I went to spa for back and leg massage lovely and relaxed in spa and pool went to bar and bistro for dinner food lovely and breakfast great all staff very nice to everyone ground beautiful to walk or cycle around would love to visit again in summer or near Christmas my husband would love to play golf there lots to do expensive but a great treat,5,2024,03,17
217,"A fantastic 5 star experience, made really special by the staff","My room was absolutely amazing, but the best thing about Powerscourt hotel was the staff.  They were so lovely, helpful and friendly, doing everything they could to make sure I had a really wonderful, 5 star experience.   I had my first fine dining experience in the Sika restaurant.  There was a fabulous selection of vegetarian options, and a wonderful, attentive waitress who made the evening really special for me.  The spa treatments were brilliant, and the relaxation area so calming.  I really enjoyed the pool, and also availed of a complementary bicycle to go and see the beautiful river on the Powerscourt Estate.  All in all, I highly recommend Powerscourt Hotel and I'd do it all again tomorrow.",5,2024,03,17
217,Truly  5 stars!!!,"Everything is superlative! Starting from the location, which is a dream! The food is excellent, congratulations to the chefs! The room...splendid! Impeccable cleanliness! I had a little problem in the room, I asked a boy who worked there to help me, he said he was calling the engineer, but after some time a nice girl in an impeccable outfit came. While she helped us in a professional way (without having to wait for the engineer) she talked to us and made a joke which made us feel in a pleasant environment, not that we were were guests at a hotel. For this reason I also left the comment, to thank Stefania, you are wonderful starting from yourperfume:)! Thanks Tatu for your professionalism! The ladies at the front desk are nice. Moreover, all the staff were exceptional, with a professionalism rarely found in many hotels, but at the same time also joy and openness towards customers. This means it is a very pleasant environment to work there. We felt like stars! Classical music from the reception closes the evening in a luxurious way like the hotel, a hotel that deserves its 5 stars with congratulations. Congratulations everyone! Congratulations to the managers! We will definitely be back and wholeheartedly recommend",5,2024,03,14
217,Magnificent hotel in the most beautiful surroundings close to Dublin!,"We had another beautiful stay in our favourite hotel to celebrate a family birthday. It never disappoints!!! Impeccable service as always, the most delicious dinner and breakfast in Sika Restaurant and the best nights sleep in a luxuriously comfortable bed! 

The surroundings are absolutely incredible- hard to believe only 25 mins outside Dublin. 

No complaints at all and have been going here since it opened!

Would highly recommend!",5,2024,03,14
217,Excellent experience at Powerscourt Hotel,We had a lovely experience at the Powerscourt Hotel. Hotel and surroundings were beautiful. All staff that excellent. Friendly and helpful. Special thanks to Mossy and Laura at reception and concierge Tatu. Will definitely return to Powerscourt Hotel.,5,2024,03,13
217,Great experience for a very short break!,"Myself and my husband had the best time here! Powerscourt is just stunning. The hotel is a treat. Gorgeous surrounds both inside and out! We literally spent 20 hours here (short getaway!!) but during that time we managed to have a snack in the bar, dinner in the lovely Sally Gap restaurant (informal) a fabulous breakfast in the morning and then feeling energetic, we took the complimentary bikes around the extensive park/ grounds. (it would have helped to have been fitter!). After this exertion we committed ourselves to the spa where we sat in the comfort of the much-need jacuzzi and sauna and steam room. Bliss. Then we took a stroll to Avoca where we did a bit of shopping and had lunch (also on the premises.) My husband did the onsite distillery tour and came home with a bottle of whiskey which is a nice memento of our wonderful trip. 20 hours felt like a weekend. Staff were super friendly and we very much appreciated the late check out and room upgrade :)",5,2024,03,13
217,Treated like Queens,Recently got engaged and so decided to take my partner on a surprise night away ! From check in to check out I was absolutely blown away ! Tatu the porter was so pleasant on both check in and check out and extremely helpful ! The room and hotel breathtaking! Then to top it all off we went to the bar and received a congratulations plate and a glass of Prosecco! The service was 5 Star Jessica was a Gem! She is a credit to the the bar ! I will be back and will be recommending this Hotel to everybody ! Thank you powerscourt!,5,2024,03,13
217,coffee place closed,brought by a friend who hada good experience a few days previously.were disappointed to discover where he had  coffee previously was closed for refurbishment .we were directed downstairs which was much dearer and difficult to find so we ended up leaving,1,2024,03,11
217,Powerscourt Hotel Is Perfection,"We are fortunate in that we've had the opportunity to stay at some of the top hotels in the world; no doubt some of the most famous. However, we've settled on Powerscourt as our 'home away from home.' I am hesitant to write a 2nd review in just a few months as the hotel seems to be booked up more than ever. A recent last minute trip I found the hotel solid booked for 2 weeks but I enquired and the best res agent Aoife got my info, kept in touch with me and finally came through as we were able to book a long weekend at Powerscourt. Actually I wasn't surprised as every employee I have ever encountered at the hotel goes above and beyond to provide kind and attentive service. It starts with the 'doormen' and 'doorlady' who could not be nicer and happy to help with luggage and delivering it. There is no hotel who has a nicer front desk staff (thank you Anna for taking my room service order one night when obviously they were busy) and it continues on to the housekeepers who do an excellent job and are happy to provide extra towels, water, coffee pods etc. If you are lucky enough to stay on a Friday or Saturday the live music down in The Sally Gap is excellent. We rarely venture out of the hotel for dinner as The Sally Gap is the perfect place for a nice, casual dinner and we adore the staff. 2 months later since my last visit and the bartender immediately remembered I love the 'passion fruit martini.' Lastly, the scenery and the setting alone is enough to visit but the staff are what keeps us coming back. I'm already planning our next visit!",5,2024,03,03
217,Just perfect ,It's  very unusual to walk through a door of a hotel and to expect what happened to my wife and myself.  We were in paradise from  checking in o my god reception staff were so welcoming. We went to our room and when we opened the door I have never seen such grander perfect beautiful so clean and it was just amazing. Our next experience was the Sally gap for our dinner again fantastic staff were so friendly and the food was excellent thanks to the chefs .Best I had I a long time. Iv stayed in the best but this is our by all the best worthy of 5 stars 🌟  .thanks again to all the staff and management. ,5,2024,03,01
217,Luxurious Hotel,"My trip to Powerscourt Hotel & Spa, with my two boys and teenage daughter, was on a different level of luxury we have ever experienced. From driving through the gates and up the expansive driveway you knew you were somewhere special. Warmly greeted by the doorman and reception staff we were brought straight to our room. The size of the suite is incredible. The balcony over looking the beautiful landscape will take your breath away. Everything is just bigger and more incredible than anywhere you will have been before. The attention to detail from the rooms to the stunning pool with heated loungers and the 5 star food and service will be sure to delight even the most critical of guests. My children, and even my teenager, and myself cannot praise the staff and amenities enough. We enjoyed a cycle through the estate on complementary bicycles and played a game of lawn chess before departure. Thank you Powerscourt you out done yourselves!",5,2024,02,21
217,A wonderful stay,Our first night away in 2024 and it will be a hard act to follow . We had the most wonderful stay from the moment we checked in. We were lucky enough to be upgraded ( this never happens to us!) and whilst our room was being prepared we were given a complimentary drink in the bar as the check in was late. This was no hardship as we had a lovely time mingling with another couple we met in the Sally Gap Bar watching the rugby.  We had a delicious dinner in Sika restaurant and adjourned to the room to watch the Superbowl. This trip was finished off by way of an apology for late check in with a box of chocolates and a late check out. We could not recommend this hotel highly enough and will definitely return and have recommended it to other family members. The staff are amongst the friendliest we have met over the years and we were sorry we weren't staying longer.,5,2024,02,21
217,Treat yourself!,"Another fantastic visit to Powerscourt, 
We have stayed here at least once a year since it opened in 2007 and always look forward to returning.
It's a beautiful hotel in a unique location, stunning Wicklow countryside and only 45mins from Dublin airport or Dublin city centre.
The Lobby is gorgeous, the rooms and bathrooms are fantastic.
We had a tiny bit of cosmetic damage by the mini bar where idiots have used the furniture to open bottles from the fridge, there is a bottle opener!
We ate in the new Sally Gap restaurant which is lovely and the food was excellent. we would, next time, revert back to the Sika restaurant but only because we prefer the ambience in SIKA, no criticism of the Sally Gap whatsoever.
The main reason for this review are the staff, they make the difference. From the front desk staff / Doorman to the Sally Gap staff they were outstanding.
Special mention to the lovely young gentleman doing the room turn down's and the lady who delivered our breakfast.
Load's to do, even within walking distance, ""Powerscourt Gardens"" in National Geographics Top Ten gardens in the world is a ten minute walk from the Hotel.
Treat yourself!",5,2024,02,19
217,Worth a visit,An amazing hotel nestled in beautiful grounds. The room was so spacious and had everything we could possibly ask for and the balcony was a welcome extra. The spa was luxurious and modern and the perfect space to relax. The food was amazing if a little expensive .,5,2024,02,18
217,Luxurious and relaxing stay - a real treat.,Beautiful room on the 6th floor with a wall of windows looking out at the view from a large balcony. Fabulous food in the evening and excellent breakfast with lots of choices. Lovely relaxing time in the Spa and swimming pool on the afternoon we arrived.,5,2024,02,18
217,Top class hotel with great staff.,Our first visit to this hotel and we were bowled over by the whole experience. From the minute we arrived until we left we found everything to be top class. Our room was superb. We used the spa facilities and had a treatment each. Top class. Dined in Sika restaurant and food was great plus breakfast next morning was wonderful.,5,2024,02,15
217,Sad for a 5 star hotel,Stunning views and amazing view.  But….. Poor customer care. Make sure your room is cleaned if you are staying for more than one night. Very slow response from the room service. Again really poor customer care experience for a “5” star hotel!,3,2024,02,11
217,Exceptional,"Exceptional break in an Exceptional hotel. From the greeting at the door the whole way through our stay staff, accommodation and food were all excellent. Room was more like a suite than just a bedroom.  Would highly recommend if you are looking for a real pampering weekend with all the trimmings.",5,2024,02,11
217,Fabulous stay,"My partner and I had a wonderful overnight stay at Powercourt Hotel. From the moment we entered the hotel we were meet with attentive and friendly staff. Throughout our stay the staff went the extra mile to make our stay special from every housekeeper we pasted in the corridor saying hello, to every request we ask being fulfil promptly with a smile.

Our room was incredible. We borrowed bikes and cycled around the powercourt ground which has spectacular views of the mountains. Again the lady on the door gave us advice on the best route for a lesuirely cycle. We had a delicious meal in the Sallygap bar. I had emailed ahead to ask for a table by the window and although when we arrived there was none free within 5 mins the staff offered us a table by the window. 

The only downfall was at the time we went to the Spa there was a lot of children in the pool, which for those looking for a relaxing spa experience might be something to consider. That said the spa does have dedicated times for adults only. 

Overall I would 100% recommend and hope to return in the future",5,2024,02,08
217,Oh wow!,"My friend and myself decided to treat ourselves to a night here and it exceeded our expectations.  What a fabulous place in beautiful surroundings.  The staff are so friendly and polite and nothing is too much trouble.  The room was fantastic with a dressing room, lovely bathroom and a balcony overlooking the grounds and mountains behind the hotel.  Amazing! We’ll be back!!",5,2024,02,07
217,Amazing Hotel & Experience well worth a visit.,Thoroughly enjoyed my stay at this amazing hotel. Its certainly lived up to expectations. The staff in every area of the hotel were so friendly & welcoming. The facilities are very good. I was unfortunately not therr long enough to try all. It's a long time since I experienced such good customer service.,5,2024,02,06
217,The ideal hotel for a special occasion or a relaxing break,"We had a one night break to celebrate a special occasion in the Powerscourt Hotel and we loved every minute of our stay. The staff were warm and friendly as well as professional and efficient from the concierge and receptionist to the lovely driver who drove us to the nearby village in the hotel courtesy car. The hotel was spotless and we had a beautiful suite with all mod cons (very cool to press a button to open your curtains in the morning from your bed!!)  Cocktails in the new Sally Gap bar were amazing and it has a great atmosphere especially for pre dinner drinks. The pool stands out as different to other hotels, it is very relaxing - a very unique black pool with sparkling lights on the floor. The grounds of the hotel are beautiful and we enjoyed a browse in the Avoca shop on site. The hotel is in a great location (beautiful green Wicklow) with close proximity of the Sugar Loaf mountain (it was a half hour hike for us to get great views) and the village of Enniskerry which has a lovely pub/restaraunt and cute shops to browse through. Overall I have never felt so well taken care of and welcomed in a hotel and it really felt like a 5 star experience. I would highly recommend it for a special occasion or just to get a break from the real world!!",5,2024,02,05
217,Looking for magic!,"I had ALOT to celebrate in January 2024..... My partner turning the big 4-0, the fact that we had just gone sale agreed on our first home together AND I am expecting our first child together in April this year so as u can imagine.... The pressure was on to find somewhere with that extra bit of specialness and magic to celebrate all these huge events happening in our life!
And wow..... Powerscourt had lit that firework and alot more!! From the moment of driving up towards the hotel I had that pretty woman moment of just wow look at the size of it and how gorgeous it was and walking inside was even more amazing! Gorgeous music being played from the Piano in the lobby, staff assisting to take our overnight bags, and the most helpful staff on front of desk checking us in (thanks Sive!)
Again another pinch me am I dreaming moment when we went up to our room, really beautiful decorated and they left my partner a really tasty cake with a candle and a happy birthday card on the table for him! Such small gestures really meant such big things to us. Sadly we had to leave the hotel room at some point (our room was nearly the size as the house we just bought!) but loved exploring the hotel and the distillery tour on the grounds was the perfect way to celebrate Alan turning 40! 
Dinner that night was in the Sika restaurant where the staff were so polite and efficient even though the hotel was busy they definetly didn't show any signs of stress.... True professionals!! 
Retreated back to the room where I had a pamper night in the huge bathroom  WITH underfloor heating (my 7 month pregnant body loved this especially!!) then jumped into bed and went to bed never wanting to the day to end. 

However more was to come..... And this was the epicness that is hotel breakfasts. Powerscourt definitely did not disappoint. I loooove hotel breakfasts so much so I was ready by 8am to go down to get the full experience and we'll it met my dreams and more.... As I was shown to my table I noted all the different selections, cold meats, yogurts, breads, fruits, cereals, these amazing yogurt and granola homemade pots (I had two) juices, waffles and then the hot breakfast food!! Then to my even bigger delight you could order direct from the kitchen.... I knew mine was to be the classic eggs Benedict which was so good I had to take a photo just so I could remind myself how good it was (and to make my family jealous at home!!) breakfast for me really is such a winner there it was so so good. 

Sadly we only stayed one night and I mean this when I say I really didn't want to leave just so relaxed and it really was the perfect place to sit back and be grateful for all we have to celebrate. 

I really would love to go back hopefully again with baby in tow as I know we will be so looked after and I really miss the underfloor heating and breakfast 😁😁 
Thank you Powerscourt for creating fireworks for me! 

Fiona and Alan.",5,2024,02,05
217,Amazing stay!,"Our stay was amazing from start to finish. Our room was very spacious, clean and comfortable. The food for both breakfast and dinner were great. The staff throughout the hotel were so welcoming, nice and helpful. There is plenty to do, we enjoyed the spa and went for a lovely walk around the grounds.",5,2024,02,05
217,Great experience,"Amazing overnight stay with my husband which was gifted to us by our kids for Christmas present. Staff extremely helpful on checkin and we were given an upgrade to beautiful suite which was a lovely surprise. We ate in The Sally Gap bar and our waitress Jessica was extremely attentive, very professional, friendly and knowledgable - she elevated our overall experience of a fantastic night away.  Thank you all",5,2024,02,03
217,Relaxing and serene,"Great food and beautiful views. The perfect place to explore Enniskerry or just stay indoors and enjoy the hotel facilities, sugarloaf longe and stunning rooms! The rooms are so spacious and have the most beautiful bathrooms. We really enjoyed our stay and hope to return!",5,2024,02,02
217,Couple Birthday Celebration,"I stayed at the Powerscourt hotel during a weekend in January of this year as a celebration for my partner's birthday. My experience from beginning to end exceeded my expectations at every point, with everything I wanted from the experience being delivered to an exceptionally high level. From the genuine friendliness and kindness of Jean at reception, who made us feel so welcome at the hotel, to the general warmth and most importantly authenticity of the staff all around the hotel, to our waiter Daniel at Sika restaurant who gave a real impression of approachability and knowledge. 

What stood out to me most was that the staff seemed to be happy and enjoying their work, and allowed to operate independently based on their own intuition, which is something that really adds to the atmosphere in a way that can't be artificially done.

Most notably, on arrival we were informed that our room had been complimentary upgraded to mark my girlfriend's birthday, which really made the weekend. 

I would highly recommend a stay at Powerscourt for anyone looking to mark a special occasion, or simply looking for an enjoyable experience, if anything then for the peace of mind in knowing that you'll have an experience that will match and exceed your expectations",5,2024,02,02
217,A winter treat.,"Enjoyed a lovely afternoon tea looking out at the Sugarloaf's silhouette as the light faded at sunset.  very relaxed ambience with attentive friendly staff. Lovely selection of fresh fluffy sandwiches,  closed and open with very generous fillings. Great choice of teas and lovely scones and pastries. A relaxing treat.",5,2024,01,31
217,Our January 2024 Min-break!,"We’re a family of 5 (including 3 kids aged 12, 10 & 6) and try to head to Powerscourt each Christmas time for an overnight trip - it's a huge treat and the kids get a great kick out of saving up for it to make sure we do it! This year we went down for a night for the family and another night / spa day for my wife (and her bestie!) as a Christmas present. 

From the minute we arrive, everyone relaxes and just enjoys the warm welcome from the Powerscourt team and straight to the room(s) as we got lucky with an early check-in. The room(s) we go for are just amazing, a suite interconnecting to a large double room looking out over the mountains. The privacy, quality, and size of the rooms are excellent, more than you’d expect! These rooms are great for the families as you get to have lots of space and privacy too! 

The kids love the pool and spend hours there, (heading up and down in their robes!), the only thing that got them out was heading to the The Sally Gap brasserie / bar for dinner - It’s a huge renovation from the previous bar, with a big extension and new menus! The food and service was excellent, including catering for our picky eaters. 

Back to the room for “movie night” and treats - with the multiple screens, catering for our different age groups - kids loved that! 

The Sika Restaurant is a big favourite for breakfast, everything you can possibly think of to eat / drink and excellent staff looking out for every opportunity to help us - the coffees were especially good! 

Then back to the pool for more fun, and on to the river walk and a wander around Powerscourt Estate & house and Avoca cafe for snacks and treats! The spa experience was so relaxing, with really well trained staff and beautiful surroundings to let the day drift away - would highly recommend adding one of the spa experiences! 

Another thing that was handy was the electric charging onsite - this has got better over the years, and now is a quality service and always space available! 

Overall, we love this hotel / staff / experience and will continue to come back - there are very few hotels we have stayed in that made us feel so welcome and so many other families staying too! Our sincere thanks to Eamonn and the team that continue to make this our family treat!",5,2024,01,31
217,In the lap of luxury in Powerscourt hotel,"My daughter and I spent a night in the hotel early January. Located in the fabulous surroundings of Powerscourt demesne with views of the Sugar Loaf mountain, the hotel is truly one of the finest in Ireland. The attention to detail and beautiful decor in the main public areas as well as the guest rooms was outstanding. 

The room included a king size bed with feather and down bedding and a large bathroom with twin sinks a bathtub and separate shower with nice toiletries. Bathrobes and complementary slippers were provided.   Also a mini bar was available. Complementary water and hot beverages and cookies were provided. 

We enjoyed a 3 course set menu dinner and buffet breakfast in the Sika Restaurant which were delicious and used the freshest of ingredients. 

We also used the leisure centre including crystals pool, jacuzzi and hammam suite which were so relaxing!

The Powerscourt house and gardens are a five minute walk from the hotel which are worth a visit. We would highly recommend a stay here!

All the staff were so welcoming, attentive,  friendly and helpful! 

Only note to hotel is although there was a nespresso machine in the room a kettle would have been better for tea making.",5,2024,01,30
217,Amazing,"Just back from fabulous stay in powerscourt hotel. From the minute we arrived it was just fab. 
When we checked in our room wasn’t ready so we went for a walk and had a drink the sally gab bar, barman was lovely there, 
We got a call shortly that our room was ready, we booked a deluxe king room and was just amazing, clean, tidy and just wow.
We went Down to the pool for an hour and it was lovely and relaxing, we didn’t get any treatments as we left it too late to book but definitely will next time. 
We ordered drinks to our room while we were getting ready and they arrived in good and the margarita was just right. 
We sat in the lobby while we waited to go have dinner and they staff there were lovely and attentive, ordered a drink and again was not waiting long.
Dinner was lovely in the sally gab bar, they had live music later on in the night.
For breakfast we got room service (we don’t get away the two of us much) and it was lovely",5,2024,01,28
217,Wonderful experience!,"My wife and I stayed at the Powerscourt Hotel in January with our newborn, and we had the best time!  With our Ambassador status, we are fortunate to get to travel a lot, and this property was top notch. The hotel and rooms were absolutely gorgeous, and all of our meals at the restaurant were delicious. The staff were incredibly helpful and accommodating. Mossy at the concierge went out of his way on multiple occasions to assist us and make sure we had everything we needed. It was a perfect stay to rest and relax on our first international trip as a family!",5,2024,01,22
217,The best hotel stay in Ireland,"A big call but we really felt this was one of the best getaway stay we’ve had in Ireland. Fantastic service, wonderful atmosphere, delicious food. We ate in the sally gap restaurant and loved the relaxed atmosphere and flawless food. Our server was fantastic and we felt really looked after. We will absolutely return at some point in the future.",5,2024,01,21
217,Amazing stay with amazing staff,"My mam, my aunty and myself took a trip to Powerscourt as my mam had been twenty years ago and always rants and raves about the stay. My mam is undergoing cancer treatment so we booked it as a pick me up for her week off.

Every member of staff was extremely friendly and helpful. We had spa treatments which where amazing ( my mam is still talking about how nice her massage and facial was two weeks later). 

We had dinner in sika restaurant and the attention to detail was next to none. The breakfast was lovely and the variety of food available was excellent.

Will hopefully be back with my mam some day soon.",5,2024,01,20
217,A Bit of Pure Midwinter Magic at Powerscourt,"Our recent (Jan 2024) stay at the Powerscourt Hotel made for a lovely holiday after the holidays.  

We arrived for three nights during the last days of the Christmas season, and spent the stay at Powerscourt and in the surrounding area of Enniskerry, Bray, etc.
The room and facilities of the Powerscourt were all that one expects of a fine hotel: clean, extremely orderly, beautifully appointed and decorated.

The staff and service at the hotel was friendly, kind, and helpful. I made silly requests (for example, some seeds to take on a local trail where we had befriended a robin) and was treated with kindness and understanding. More nominal requests were taken care of with wonderful speed.  

The dining and breakfast service at the on-site restaurants is delicious, and once again the service was helpful. Friendly conversations and recommendations from staff led us to some of our activities outside the hotel, and all were excellent suggestions. We ordered from the different menus with some variety, and each item was as good or better than described. We also took afternoon tea at the Lounge (made special unasked for our 10th anniversary- thank you for this!), which was singular.  

Another activity we experienced at Powerscourt was a visit with the falconer and some of his avian friends. We have never had an experience like this before; it was fascinating and a joy. I can only imagine it would be perfect for younger visitors.

We hiked Bray Head to take in sunrise over the Irish Sea. Absolutely beautiful. The waterfall was another gorgeous spot; an easy stroll from the parking lot. The Estate gardens are magnificent and a must-see. A hike up Sugar Loaf was recommended to us, and  it looks splendid, but we didn't fit it in- something for a future visit!

Our visit to Powerscourt was a truly lovely holiday in what is nominally a bleak part of the year. It was filled with memories we will keep with us. Our thanks to the staff, from the front end personnel to the falconer, and the management for making it so.

Cheers and Sláinte,
Cody and Megan Seibel",5,2024,01,20
217,"Brilliant stay, we will be back!","Absolutely loved our stay at this very special hotel. Went with my partner, my six year old daughter and 9week old baby to meet some friends for New year's Eve. The staff were fabulous especially for folk travelling with kids, a cot and extra bed for my six year old was set up in our room while we were out at dinner with zero fuss, everything was done so efficiently. The room was very spacious, I loved the bathroom and the room had everything we needed. I really liked the fact the hotel had a mixture of guests too, families, young and old, singles, couples, groups, all ages and folk from everywhere - locals and tourists. The hotel restaurants were great, we ate in the Sika restaurant, the kids menu was very affordable and good variety. We loved the pool too, had a great swim session including the baby, it was her first pool swim and she loved it. We will definitely be back, planning to take my Mum for her birthday. The hotel had a band playing for New Year's which was a nice touch and handed out fizz at 12! The local village Enniskerry and surrounding area is beautiful, the view from the hotel is stunning and there's plenty of walks within the hotel grounds and nearby. It's very easy and quick to get to from Dublin on the m50 motorway however we took the scenic route through the Dublin mountains for the views! This did not add long to the journey time.",5,2024,01,20
217,Our favourite Irish Hotel,"We have stayed at this hotel numerous times and it is one of our favourites. Great atmosphere, great staff and wonderful food. We enjoyed breakfast each day and dinned at the restaurant twice. We especially like tea in the lounge, as the Powerscourt Hotel has the best scones we have encountered. We received a beautiful upgrade and the suite was very beautiful and helpful as we were able to entertain before dinner. The hotel has an excellent staff as everyone we dealt with was extremely polite and helpful. We love staying at this Hotel. Thank you most sincerely.",5,2024,01,20
217,Excellent Stay,"We stayed for one night in a Mountain View suite, amazing views from the balcony, room was huge with separate living and bedroom areas. Room was clean and well equipped. The Sally Gap bar has been totally renovated since our last stay and it has improved the overall experience greatly. Cocktails in both the bar and the foyer are beautiful and there’s a huge selection. We ate a 3 course meal in The Sika Restaurant, the food was amazing. We had such a lovely time chilling out at the pool and taking walks around The Powerscourt Estate. A beautiful hotel and we look forward to visiting again in the future.",5,2024,01,19
217,Excellent experience overall,"We had a lovely stay in early January after all the Christmas festivities were over. It was relaxing and so comfortable. The staff on arrival were really welcoming and made it feel like we were there to be spoiled. I was just super impressed with the overall culture of the hotel, it's 100% focused on the guest experience which is not so common these days. The staff were really well trained and looked like they enjoyed what they did which makes for a lovely atmosphere. The hotel itself is a beautiful building and very comfortable rooms. It's so nice to find a hotel that's well managed and run by staff who are passionate about what they do, thank you.",5,2024,01,17
217,The Best Place for an Irish Babymoon Escape,"My wife and I are expecting our first baby and decided that we would have a little escape to just have some quality time together before the baby's arrival in a couple of months time. 

Ironically, when we stayed in Powerscourt it was only a 15 minute drive from our house in south Dublin.  But honestly, it doesn't matter how far away you live, this place is special. You will always get the sense of escaping and hiding in one of the most picturesque valleys of Wicklow with amazing views of the Sugarloaf.

We stayed in mid November and they had the Christmas decorations just up which started off our Christmas period on a high. The place is spectacular at Christmas.

When we checked in at reception we spoke with a super friendly member of staff who gave us a complimentary upgrade. When I say upgrade, I mean the best UPGRADE we have ever received. Our initial package was just for one night in one of their standard rooms, the staff member at the front desk ended up giving us a beautiful, luxurious suite. My wife's pregnancy has been tough and making her feel quite ill at times, so having this kind of room to relax in for her really made our trip so special. 

After prying ourselves out of the room my wife had a pregnancy friendly treatment which she absolutely loved and again made her feel so relaxed. I used the gym and we both enjoyed the pool afterwards. The facilities are top class. 

For food, we had an early dinner in the new restaurant, The Sally Gap. The food was amazing, we both ordered steak and it was cooked perfectly as requested. Now can I take a minute just to mention the Old Fashioned cocktail that they make in the bar, absolutely glorious! Honestly the best Old Fashioned I've ever had. I want their recipe so badly! I have even bought Roe and Co whiskey since to try and recreate it! 

After our early dinner we chilled in the suite where we did treat ourselves to room service where we got some desserts to satisfy our cravings. 

Breakfast again had everything you could imagine and was set in the beautiful, bright Sika resaurant. 

Honestly, it was one of the best stays we have ever had, we will definitely be back to to again escape in our local getaway.",5,2024,01,16
217,"Luxury stay, amazing location","I was fortunate enough to travel to Powerscourt on a business trip. From start to finish it oozed luxury. The exterior and interior is decorated to such a high and unique standard. Every single employee I interacted with was solely focused on me and I was made feel very special indeed. The Sally Gap restaurant was beautiful, exquisite food and such the right amount of interaction allowing you to have your meal and not have an empty glass. The rooms were spacious and the balcony looked into the mountains, fountain and beautiful grounds. I would highly recommend a stay, it was by far the best stay o have in Republic of Ireland in a number of years.",5,2024,01,15
217,Excellent,"I stayed in powerscourt hotel  in January 2024 and it was my first time,I noticed a “winter sale” offer which included €50 dinner voucher and breakfast for €285 
I can now say it was incredible value,a stunning hotel with stunning views and grounds to walk around.I arrived at the hotel and greeted outside and inside the door by all very pleasant staff,I arrived a little early and my room was not ready but that was no problem as I went to the bar to enjoy a drink and the views,when my room was ready my bag was already their for me,I didn’t have to worry.The staff in the bar were also very nice and I didn’t have to wait or move for a drink,it was a cold day and their was two beautiful fires on.
I booked into the Sally gap bar via text which was very easy,I had the duck salad for starters and the beef burger for main.just like the staff at the Sally gap restaurant it was incredible,I didn’t get to use the pool as I was so relaxed in the hotel and hopefully I will the next time,next morning I had breakfast which I thought was absolutely incredible,I got full Irish breakfast which was outstanding along with honey fruit waffles yogurt and orange juice.still full 😊
Great value great staff great location",5,2024,01,15
217,Memorable Stay in beautiful Wicklow.,"Top class Hotel, with great service by all the friendly and helpful staff, from checking in to the restaurant and concierge, especially John. The food was excellent during the entire weekend. Highly recommend for a special treat. I give this venue 10/10",5,2024,01,14
217,A perfect end to a fantastic week in Ireland,"My wife and I ended our first trip to Ireland at Powerscourt hotel, and we're very happy we did. This was a very pleasant experience, from the moment we arrived. Which was by car. The place was easy to find,  good signs along the road after we took of from the motorway. No problem finding a parking spot at the hotel, we didn't look underground as it wasn't needed.
Very polite staff at arrival in a nice lobby - still decorated for Christmas.
Our room was perfect, with a good view - no noise from the hallway or neighbors - good sized bed with nice sheets (important for my wife).
Bathroom with separate bath and shower (with space)
We didn't try the SPA, but the pool was nice. Especially since they had dedicated times for grown-ups only (we have no kids and the pool area is often dominated by them at other hotels)
Food was pleasant.
I know the golf course isn't part of the hotel, but it's my passion. Hence it was a big plus that I could play a the Powers Course East course while staying.
We'd love to come back, as there's a lot more to experience there. Especially in the summer, when the garden is blooming :-)",5,2024,01,14
217,A magical trip ✨️,"We stayed in Powerscourt for a 2 night retreat and had the most wonderful time there. The hotel itself is so intricately decorated and extremely clean and polished. The lounge area is full of comfy couches, some of them facing a roaring fire, where we could sit down and have a casual drink. Same with the rooms, extremely clean and we had the views of the stunning gardens and sugar loaf mountains.
We dined at the Sika restaurant and the Sally gap and thought the food was such high quality. Best in Ireland.
The staff in both the restaurants were very attentive and went out of their way to make sure we were looked after and all our dietary requirements were met! The spread at the breakfast buffet had so many varieties of things to try and again everything was such high quality!
Have to mention their private adult jacuzzi area in the spa facilities is amazing, the pools look over the gardens outside and is so relaxing!
This was our 2nd time staying with Powerscourt and both times everything has been consistently excellent. It was a magical trip and we will definitely be going back again.",5,2024,01,14
217,An impressive experience!,"A truly impressive experience - from the majestic building, the stylish lobby, the cosy, luxurious lounges with lovely fireplace areas, the nicely decorated rooms with high-quality details, to the well groomed garden and golf course in the middle of the winter - everything had a thoughtful attention to details to make a good impression on the visitor. Worth mentioning the well diversified breakfast and the delicious cuisine variety at the restaurants. Friendly and very accommodating staff. We also loved that the hotel had separated the adults-only pool times from the rest. We highly recommend this place!",5,2024,01,13
217,Amazing 👏,Had an amazing stay on NYE at powerscourt . The room was stunning . The hotel itself is beautiful the atmosphere and  in particular the staff were amazing.  The pool and jacuzzi is definitely worth taking advantage of . Breakfast was served  with a beautiful view of wicklow and the sugarloaf. The Breakfast selection was brilliant and extremely high quality.  The check out was busy being new years day but the staff were very helpful and friendly.  Would definitely stay again.,5,2024,01,12
217,The best spa,"I cannot reccomend the spa at Powerscourt Hotel enough. Everytime I visit I never want to leave. A 5 star experience from start to finish. Laura was my therapist and gave me a back, shoulder and head massage along with a facial and I was in heaven. Laura is a lady and a pure professional. All the staff at the spa and the hotel were so welcoming and friendly. I cannot wait to visit again and next time I do visit I will be visiting the spa and staying overnight. I cannot reccomend visiting enough. Book now guys 🌟🌟🌟🌟🌟",5,2024,01,11
217,Fantastic five star luxury Experience from start to finish,We visited the Powerscourt Hotel for our Wedding Anniversary and it was a truly memorable experience. The Hotel itself is a masterpiece and is made even more special by the warm and pleasant team there. The spa and all the dining we enjoyed were top class. We were made to feel very special and are looking forward to visiting again. Would highly recommend.,5,2024,01,10
217,New Year mini break,"What struck me most about Powerscourt were the smiling staff and friendly attitude of all who worked there. We were greeted with happy staff members from the moment we walked through the door. 

The accommodation was beyond compare with a bed that was akin to sleeping in a cloud. Breakfast was a triumph with fabulous views of the Sugarloaf. We had dinner in the brasserie with possibly the best gin and tonics ever. Grapefruit slices were a total winner. 

My hat goes off to the chef who designed and executed the afternoon tea deserts. They were works of art that tasted even better than they looked. Amazing attention to detail . The pool was very relaxing and we enjoyed a couple of dips during our  stay. 

All in all I would give Powerscourt top marks for a wonderful break. 
PS the gingerbread house in the lobby was incredible.",5,2024,01,10
217,Dreadful service in the lounge area,"Called in for drinks with my family.
After 20 minutes of waiting, I actually had to get up and ask the 2 waiters if we could have something to drink.
They were deep in conversation and seemed annoyed to be disturbed.
Their English was not good, and I think they had difficulties understanding me.
End of long story, the service was horrific, the drinks were all mixed up. No spoons, no cream for the hot chocolates etc. I had to get up again and go and ask for the bill.
There was some manager guy running around but was obviously not aware of this awful service.
We were so sad that the Powerscourt Hotel has gone downhill so much.
It used to be so good.
We will not return!",2,2024,01,09
217,Best stay - birthday present for my wife,We had a brilliant stay. We were given a complementary upgrade to a suite with garden view. Dinner and cocktails were amazing and the atmosphere around the hotel was great. The spa was nice and quiet. Overall it was a great stay,5,2024,01,08
217,A most perfect stay .,"My pal and I had a most wonderful 4 days over Christmas 2023.
We loved the location and the bedroom.

The staff were exceptional, and so friendly even though they were working at this season .

The food was beautiful.",5,2024,01,08
217,just amazing and 100% value for money.,"Our experience on New Years Eve was incredible. Lovely and friendly staff, rapid check in, the room was amazing and the bathroom fit for a queen. The bed was so comfy, breakfast was spot on and the food in the Sally Gap was incredible. I just cannot fault this hotel in any way - our Spa treatment was punctual, relaxing and simply the best. Keep up the good work. I will be back. Eileen",5,2024,01,08
217,Excellent Customer Service ,"It was a lovely experience from start to finish. I was initially in touch with staff from reception regarding voucher and they couldn't be more helpful then from check in we had the lovely surprise of being upgraded to gorgeous suite with huge balcony.

We also had dinner in Sika restaurant which was 100 percent excellent customer service and drinks in Sally gap bar and the bar tenders were extremely helpful

Already looking forward to our next stay which will hopefully include the spa 😊",5,2024,01,07
217,A night to remember ,"One of the best stays of my life. I asked my partner to marry me and thankfully she said yes. I fully believe that the hotel helped that decision.

From the staff to the food I couldn't find fault for the two nights we stayed. I hope to be back soon. ",5,2024,01,07
217,Unmissable experience,"I don’t think words do this hotel justice, we travelled there between Christmas and New Years with my parents and my children, aged 5 and 11, from the moment we arrived the atmosphere was magical, it was beautifully decorated, full of atmosphere and had a really cosy feel. 
We brought the kids bikes and explored the gardens, the pool was another highlight not to mention the magnificent Powerscourt waterfall, we even managed a trip to the onsite playground. The room was spacious, spotless and so comfortable, the beds were literally like clouds. The staff were amazing from the incredible cleaning team, restaurant staff to the bar men, every single staff member we met chatted away happily, asking the kids about Santa etc. Both the brasserie and the restaurant served beautiful food and breakfast was out of this world, with so much choice. Everything was fresh and again the staff couldn’t do enough for you, they all seemed so happy working there too which really added to the magic. 
There is a large playroom opposite the bar which both the children loved, it has toys suitable for all ages, this enabled us as parents to have some downtime in the evenings. The kids made friends there and just had the best time, numbers were swooped and they remain in contact which is lovely. 
We can’t wait to go back. It truly was a magical stay full of wonderful memories, the first of many stays in this wonderful hotel. Thanks to everyone at Powerscourt for that extra sprinkle of magic over our Christmas. 

",5,2024,01,07
217,Hugely recommend this hotel ,We hugely enjoyed our visit to powerscourt over Christmas. The decorations were picture perfect with lovely touches such as a holly wreath on the room door and hot chocolate and mince pies upon arrival. The service is always exceptional and the hotel and spa are always immaculate and super comfortable. I couldn’t recommend this hotel more. ,5,2024,01,07
217,Disappointing gluten free afternoon tea,"My daughter very kindly took me and her grandmother for a festive afternoon tea this week. She mentioned on booking that I am gluten free and that her grandmother was celebrating her 95th birthday. The hotel is beautiful with stunning views and the Christmas decorations were fabulous. The staff were also very pleasant. But this was not a five star experience. Firstly, my mother's 95th birthday was never mentioned. It would not have taken much effort to make a little fuss of her. A few kind words cost nothing. The gluten free afternoon tea was totally underwhelming! The staff did not have knowledge of what was gluten free. I was told there was a vegan menu for me at the start!! Gluten free and vegan are not the same!! The festive afternoon tea for the others was beautiful and really had the wow factor with a Christmas cake and snowman cake on top. Mine came out and my face fell with disappointment. The worst part was that the snowman was actually gluten free but had not been put on my plate. Most of the Christmas tree was gluten free so it could easily have been amended to make it so. When I said to a staff member that the snowman looked gluten free she said it was up to me what I ate but that she would check it out. I was then told it was gluten free. I was also asked later if something was gluten free. It shouldn't be up to me to tell them! Maybe this was a language issue but it wouldn't fill anyone with confidence. Another very important issue for Coeliacs is cross contamination. My scones were lovely but I was expected to share the same cream and jam as my fellow diners. This should be known in any restaurant but I was shocked at this in a five star hotel! Overall, this was not what I expected. My mother and daughter enjoyed their afternoon tea but it would rate among the poorest I have had. It's a shame and would definitely put me off coming to stay in this hotel.",3,2024,01,07
217,Fabulous Christmas experience,"One of our most enjoyable hotel stays ever! We spent 3 nights over Christmas and the hotel was beautifully decorated. Had dinner twice in the Sika Restaurant where the service was very professional and friendly without being intrusive. When there as a delay with our wine order our excellent waiter Daniel presented us with an unexpected complimentary glass of wine while we were waiting.  The breakfast buffet was as good as we have had anywhere and the table service was efficient and again very courteous. Lauren greeted us by name when we arrived on the second and third morning - we were impressed! Our children and grandchildren joined us on the day for Christmas dinner. They enjoyed it so much they want to make it an annual event! The selection of food was comprehensive and very tasty. There was plenty of space in the ballroom and we were really unaware that it was full of children. I wish I could remember the name of the young lady in charge of our table as she was first class, very smiley and courteous and anything we asked for was delivered with great efficiency.
The gym and pool area were spotless and of course the setting in the estate allowed us several lovely walks. 
We will be back!",5,2024,01,06
217,just breathtaking,"from the scenic views as you drive through the estate to the excellent and professional staff, i just couldn't recommend Powerscourt hotel enough. My partner booked us a surprise trip away over the holiday season and this stay will honestly be a memory we will cherish forever. Powerscourt is the perfect place to just escape away from your everyday life. it encapsulates the finest Irish scenery that just took our breath away. the hotel rooms were immaculately clean and very spacious considering we didnt even get a suite. we were never left short of things to do while staying here. from visiting Enniskerry village to walking the hotel gardens to going to the spa, which was just complete luxury! what really impressed us the most was the dining. i've never been so doted on. to say the staff here are attentive is an understatement. Whilst just having coffee and scones in the sugarloaf, Eve was very attentive and a pleasure to converse with. the scones here are a must try. later on that evening we dined in sallygap which was just true perfection. dario waited on us for the night and couldnt have been more helpful for recommending the food. i got the cod and my partner got the stirloin which were both delicious. the cocktails here were just pure art. i felt like everyone here went out of there way to make this trip special. we certainly will be back",5,2024,01,05
217,5 star visit,"Wonderful two night stay in this beautiful hotel. A lovely warm welcome from reception with an upgrade that we were very grateful for. Beautiful suite spotless and classic interior.
Had a lovely time in the Spa. Girls at reception were very kind. Special mention to my therapist Gissell who gave me an amazing facial, very professional service and a lovely person to deal with.
We'd dinner in Sika. Food was top notch service by Ava was courteous and prompt.
Breakfast there on both mornings was excellent.
A really warm atmosphere throughout. Staff were lovely throughout. Highly recommend and am looking forward to a third stay in this beautiful hotel in the near future.",5,2024,01,03
217,Vintage Luxury,We ended up staying at the Powerscourt as an unplanned part of our trip to Ireland. We were feeling a bit under the weather and needed a night or R&R. Room service movies and the huge soaking tub did the trick. The hotel and grounds are breathtaking its nice retreat from the hustle and bustle.,5,2024,01,03
217,No. 1 in Ireland,"Our 3rd time visiting The Powerscourt hotel, and it keeps getting better and better. So much so that we will return once again early January 2024.

The Powerscourt hotel is our favorite spot in the whole of Ireland. The calmness throughout the hotel and the breathtaking grounds it sits on allows for the body and mind to reset like nowhere else. From the room quality and cleanliness, the spa with a serenity leisure area to the breakfast and dinners, you have to see it to feel it. Time and time again the staff are the icing on the cake throughout the hotel, incredibly friendly and diligent.

We look forward to our return in January 2024 and many more trips stays through the year.",5,2024,01,02
217,A little slice of heaven,"This is a stunning hotel set in breathtaking country park, the hotel’s Christmas decorations were magical. The rooms were massive and so beautifully decorated. The hotel proved a free shuttle to Enniskerry village (Harvey the driver was brilliant giving us tips where to go and where to visit on the hotel grounds and in the village) which was lovely we had a bit of lunch there when we were done we rang and they sent the free shuttle for us, when we got back to the hotel they offered us complementary hot chocolate which was so lovely. We then went to the Sally Gap bar in the hotel for some cocktails which were good value and strong (delighted). We had dinner in the Sally Gap and it was delicious, my entire family agreed. The breakfast selection was extensive and so good, staff were very attentive. This is definitely my heaven on earth. This place is a must!! Stick it on your bucket list… you’ll be glad you did.",5,2024,01,02
217,Unforgettable New Year Experience,"Stayed in Powerscourt as part of the bridal party for my friends wedding. The experience was perfect from start to finish. 

My room was ready early on arrival so my wife could get ready for the wedding. 

The wedding was special. Service across the whole hotel was fantastic. Breakfast each morning was beautiful and very relaxing. 

Special mention to the reception staff who were so friendly and helpful on arrival and departure. ",5,2024,01,02
217,BEAUTIFUL HOTEL WITH FABULOUS VIEWS ,"A beautiful experience everyone should treat themselves to. It's such a lovely hotel with tasteful decor. We had dinner in The Sally Gap restaurant and the food was delicious. The suites are really luxurious, have a door bell and a hanging christmas holly wreath, which was a nice touch, giving beautiful smells as you walk past the rooms. All the staff are really professional, helpful and afford the time for a chat. They have a real sense of loving their jobs which says alot about the management and how the hotel is run. Thanks to everyone for a very memorable stay.",5,2023,12,31
217,Magical Christmas and Birthday Experience,"Everyone from reception, to room service, to spa attendants, and Sika Restaurant staff were fantastic. Views were breathtaking, the room was spectacular. Would not hesitate a moment to stay here again!",5,2023,12,30
217,Highly recommended ,"My partner and I stayed here on our return home for Christmas. We arrived in from Sydney after a long flight and had the most incredible experience from the moment we arrived. The service, food and accommodation is incredible. 
I grew up locally and have visited the spa and restaurants many times with friends and family, but it was my first time staying at the hotel and it was a really special experience. 
It was my partners first time in Ireland and he was mesmerised by the decor, views and service. We are already planning our next stay! Highly recommend  ",5,2023,12,30
217,Christmas Stay at Powerscourt on our trip home from the UAE,Powerscourt had everything my partner and I needed to make our trip relaxing and enjoyable. The staff made us feel so welcome. The room was very comfortable. The ESPA spa is a must visit. The Sally Gap had an amazing and tasty selection of food,5,2023,12,29
217,Outstanding Powerscourt Xmas experience-WOW!!,"We have been going to Powerscourt for a pre Xmas break with the family for the last eight years.It is an exceptional hotel with staff that make you feel incredibly welcome.
In particular, Lauren in SIKA restaurant and Mossy at the front desk are terrific and couldn’t do enough for us.
The food is terrific and well catered for adults and kids.
Plenty to do during the day as the location is amazing, cosy walks in the grounds or some spa pampering are particular favorites of ours.
Shout out to the General Manager, Mr.Eamonn Casey for your availability and warm greetings.
Great job Powerscourt, already looking forward to our next visit.",5,2023,12,28
217,Great stay as always,"I have visited powerscourt hotel a number of times and have made very special memories there over the years. Our most recent visit was probably one of the best. All staff we encountered were so friendly and helpful. Dinner in sika was delicious and breakfast was amazing too. We were never left waiting/asking for anything, the staff were just on point and vigilant which is so nice to see and something that is rare enough these days. Views from the room are unbelievable and the Christmas decor in the hotel is so magical and cosy. We were only there for one night but felt like we had a week away, it was so relaxing.",5,2023,12,27
217,Festive afternoon tea ,"Absolutely fantastic.  As soon as we walked in and saw the gigantic gingerbread church we were blown away. So many Christmas trees and staff  attending to us . Our afternoon tea food was amazing. I'll share 📸. 
",5,2023,12,27
217,Poor,"I found this hotel to be quite a let down. I treated myself to a spa night away before visiting family for Christmas. The room was large however the bathroom was very grubby. The spa was also grubby, there is a light flickering and the floors were dirty and someone came out of the changing rooms and filled up their water bottle from the water for the spa guests. This totally ruined the relaxing vibe for me. The serenity room is utterly depressing. There was dirt all over the carpet into the spa and it was underwhelming. The light also didn’t work in the area where I was asked to fill out my consultation form. I couldn’t see anything so had to stand up and do it near the desk. This is not what I expect if I am paying a premium price. I was not able to get a reservation for dinner as it was too busy so i unfortunately had to opt for room service which with a £7.50 delivery charge was utterly awful! I ordered a super food salad which consisted of oranges! Pineapple! Avocado and pomegranate. The halloumi served with it was raw and disgusting. I went to sleep hungry and feeling very dissatisfied. There were children running around the breakfast room in pyjamas. This isn’t what I anticipated and I would not return. I would infact go as far as to say for spending almost £500 in a one night stay - I was robbed. Before you book this hotel, please do your homework.",3,2023,12,26
217,Ideal staycation.,"Brought my mother here for her 90th birthday. We had stayed here before in 2022 and enjoyed our stay on this occasion as well. The Sally Gap Brassiere is a vast improvement over its predecessor McGills with excellent food.

We had asked for a cake as part of our reservation and were quite disappointed with what was provided in Sika, which were 3 small treats. Hade we known we would have brought our own cake with us. Hence the one star deduction. Notwithstanding, I do recommend the hotel. 

Staff are very welcoming and are a credit to the hotel.",4,2023,12,24
217,Magical 🎄,"This hotel just  magical!!

We visited the Powerscourt as a treat for Christmas and my upcoming birthday 🎂. 

Everything about it was excellent from start to finish.

On arrival we were kindly upgraded to a gorgeous Mountain View suite. In the huge suite there was a beautiful birthday cupcake and card waiting. This  suite is just beyond anything we have ever stayed in. It’s not just accommodation ….. it’s an experience !!

The hotel was beautifully decorated for Christmas and was spotlessly clean.
All the staff were polite and attentive.
Breakfast was fantastic and we got a beautiful seat by the window looking out to the gardens and mountains.

The surrounding grounds and views are breathtaking. If you visit make sure to explore the surrounding areas and visit the Powerscourt House gardens too. 

This was a lovely time of year to visit the hotel and there was a really charming vibe about the place. 

The Powerscourt Hotel is a magical experience. Thank you for making memories that we will treasure forever.",5,2023,12,23
217,A luxury escape that won’t disappoint!,"I was looking for a luxury escape and the powerscourt autograph hotel didn’t disappoint. The staff were exemplary from the valet parking staff, the reception, spa staff etc. They were all really helpful and friendly. The rooms were very large with a walk in closet, more like a luxury suite than a normal hotel room. It was very nicely decorated, very clean and the beds very comfortable. The black-out curtains were a treat for a really great nights sleep. The spa area and hamman suite, like the rest of the hotel was spotless and relaxing. The hotel is well laid out and is especially accessible for anyone with a mobility issues, including the spa area, grounds and surrounding area. The breakfast in the sika restaurant was exceptional, it catered for all tastes and there was a gluten free section. The food in the Sally gap was delicious, compliments to the chefs, and the service by Rita was excellent. The grounds of the hotel were very well maintained despite a storm the previous night and the gardening staff were busy at work. Overall this hotel is exceptional. I have no hesitation in recommending it to others and hope to be back soon.",5,2023,12,21
217,Best birthday ,"I celebrated my birthday at your beautiful hotel and I love everything about it! The hotel is gorgeous and the staff is super friendly and professional! Thanks a milion to Ivan who looked after us, as well to Vasilis and Lorraine (from the breakfast) ❤️",5,2023,12,19
217,A stay to remember!,"Me and my wife stayed in this beautiful hotel for a night celebrating my wife’s birthday! 
The way this hotel is run and maintained is unreal. Everything is just perfect!!!
At reception we experienced one of the most efficient, pleasant and welcoming check-in ever! 
Our room was overlooking the gardens and had a huge balcony! We have stayed in the hotel couple of years ago and I was not sure if the great standard that we experienced before would be maintained but Wow , the room looked as fresh as it was redecorated yesterday!
We had a great dinner in the Sika restaurant where the supervisor Hristiyan made our meal truly memorable! The food was a visual and gastronomic masterpiece! I would mention the apple cheesecake that was really impressive!
We had a nightcap then in the Sally Gap bar. The hostess Antonella was so welcoming and knowledgeable about drinks and service ,so she really impressed us as well!
The next morning we had breakfast in the Sika restaurant again. The choice and service was absolutely impeccable in line with our experience so far.
Of course the hotel is full of other high standard amenities as beautiful gardens, excellent pool etc.
All together our stay in this beautiful hotel was fantastic from start to finish so I can’t praise enough the staff and management!
Keep it up and we’ll see each other soon!

217,"Overpriced. 5 star setting, star service","Overpriced. 5 star setting but 2 star service. 
Lovely setting and lots of staff who are friendly but inexperienced and ineffective. Lots of apologies offered but no resolution (waiting an hour for food with kids, order wrong, called reception with no answer multiple times, requested pillows that didn't show up, bath not functioning...). €125 for a 45 minute massage for my wife was excessive
",3,2023,12,17
217,5 star and more,"We arrived on a wet dreary evening but our spirits lifted as soon as we entered the warm welcoming reception area. The girl who checked us in was so friendly and very professional. The lobby /lounge area is tastefully decorated in all its christmas glory. A lovely start to our one night stay .  Our room which was a classic king did not disappoint .it was very spacious and so so clean. Well done to the housekeeping .I can only imagine what the suites are like as this room had all we required . The room compared very favourably with our room in Adare manor. and the beds are equally as comfortable, just tell me how you achieve this ,can never manage it at home.
We had our evening meal in the Sika restaurant and what a culinary delight, from the quail starter to the perfectly cooked fillet of beef finished of by a delicious dessert.  Superb from start to finish.  We were spoilt by our waiter Daniel who acknowledged my husbands birthday with a lovely birthday plate but next time we want him to sing.
Breakfast next morning was of an equal high standard.all that you could feast on to start the day.     Unfortunately the rain persisted so we didnt get to enjoy the lovely grounds but its a reason to return. Well done to all for a very enjoyable stay",5,2023,12,16
217,5* service as it should be…,"Stayed at Powerscourt for one night on the 7/12/23.
Where does one begin, from the welcome at the door from the concierge and Mossy with his well well drilled team of porters they work effortlessly like a well oiled machine. 
Check in again smoothly with the help of a very charming young lady , her name escapes me. 
The room or suite I should say was top class , big well light and lovely temperature. Ample space walk in wardrobe and big bathroom. All were spotless. 
Ate at the sally gap restaurant. Service top class and food superb. 
Breakfast served in room next morning was excellent with a built in oven on trolley to keep everything warm. Room service was on time and server was excellent.

The hotel is located in the stunning surroundings, and the chilled atmosphere adds on to the high standard quality and beauty of the hotel. 
We will come back :-)",5,2023,12,11
217,The most wonderful stay at the most wonderful time of the year,"My mum and I experienced the most wonderful time of the year is in a December visit to the  Powerscourt Hotel. Nestled among the trees in the Dublin mountains the  hotel provided a luxurious & tranquil place to enjoy the  magic of the festive period. The Christmas decorations and fairylights created a welcoming cosy atmosphere. The rooms are immaculately clean, beautifully decorated with the comfiest beds. I had the best night's sleep ever. The breakfast has a great selection with something for everyone including those on special diets (there's even a gluten free toaster). The staff were polite and attentive. The stay was faultless and I'm definitely planning a return trip.",5,2023,12,11

217,Making Memories,"My best experience in Ireland - 5* all the way! We Know that the wonderful location and the estate has so much to see & do for every age group, however the hotel stay was the icing on the cake!From the moment we set foot inside the door, staff were amazing - especially in light of the pressures during the festive Xmas season! Such attention to detail right throughout. Room was spacious, spotless, fab bathroom & bed linen was top class providing total comfort.
Great food was enjoyed in the restaurant for dinner & breakfast. Everything down to the glass wear for drinking was the business. Checked out the spa, however due to recent illness put off a treatment till next time. I adore the Espa products stocked & used there. Gym is also great although I was there to relax & unwind, so instead enjoyed the best cocktails in the friendly bar.
Spreading the word & already my daughter in law is booking for early Feb. I was pleasantly surprised at the guests range of ages. I loved that from the very young to the elderly. everyone appeared happy & comfortable in their surroundings.
Very much look forward to a longer stay in the near future, to make more fabulous memories in life.
Congrats to all who are part of that team!!!",5,2023,12,10

217,Very Nice,"We stayed here for a wedding recently, the staff here are wonderful, friendly and acommodating, so ten out of ten for that!.
The hotel itself is stunning. We really enjoyed the leisure centre facilities and the staff down there were also wonderful, breakfast selection was also very good.
However, a few pointers have to be made considering this is a supposedly 5 star hotel.
- There was a used shower cap hanging outside our shower door when we entered the room. (obviously from a previous guest.)
- The telephone did not work in our room. (we then figured out we could use the bathroom telephone instead.)
- We were asked at breakfast if we wanted tea/coffee and after 20 minutes we had to ask three more times until it eventually arrived.
Despite the negatives, we enjoyed our stay.",4,2023,12,05
217,World Class,"From the minute you enter the Powerscourt Estate you know the experience is going to be special. The views, trees, wildlife, hotel, staff and food are all superb. The Powerscourt Gardens are spectacular and the river walk beautiful. I would highly recommend the hotel as a quick getaway for people living in Dublin. Every time I come to Powerscourt I am reminded that you only need to travel 15 minutes to feel a million miles away. ",5,2023,12,05
217,Breathtaking Surroundings & Incredible Staff who know how to take the best care of their guests!,"After a tough year for one of my sisters we took ourselves off for a night in Powerscourt and oh my what an experience we had. 

From the moment we parked the car to the time we checked out it was pure bliss from start to finish. We felt cocooned in another world just a stones throw from home but a million worlds away from all the hustle & bustle. From the warmest most professional welcome to the concierge (Conor) showing us to our room with our bags and then showing us around to the pool, fabulous dinner, entertainment, breakfast, it was all just incredible/perfect. 

The attention to detail, friendliness of the whole team, most breathtaking surroundings, we honestly felt beyond recharged, it was invigorating and we will definitely be back in the spring. 

Thanks for such an amazing experience, we needed it more than you will ever know.",5,2023,12,03

217,Stunning hotel & views,"Lovely hotel with great facilities, staff and views. Set in the beautiful hills of Wicklow the surroundings are simply stunning. The room was perfect and the bed very comfortable. We thoroughly enjoyed our stay, our tasty breakfasts and restaurant meal. If you want to chill and relax this is the perfect setting, with friendly and well trained staff to ensure your stay is I lived up to your high expectations. ",5,2023,11,30
217,A fabulous place with fabulous staff ,"We had a fabulous stay in Powerscourt hotel in November 2023. I give every aspect of our stay 10/10. From the warm welcome at the reception to finding we had received a complimentary upgrade to the fabulous food and service, the staff really go above and beyond to look after you. Travelling with 2 small children can be stressful sometimes but we were met with smiles to the swimming pool, dinner and breakfast. Nothing was a problem to the staff. On the way home we were already planning our next visit. ",5,2023,11,30
217,Anniversary Stay,"My husband and I stayed at Powerscourt on 25th November to celebrate our 35th wedding anniversary.  It was our first visit and after hearing great things about the hotel, we were very excited.   All I can say is that it it met our expectations and some!  All the staff we dealt with were friendly and efficient.  The hotel was decked out with Christmas decorations and reception had a lovely cosy fireplace.  When we were brought to a room, the lovely porter Tatu showed us a suite, which had kindly been upgraded to us . It was a garden view suite and just fabulous.  The pool facilities and grounds were lovely. Just wish that we had more time there. Dinner was lovely in the Silka Lounge and we finished the evening listening to two great musicians after our meal. All in all, a wonderful stay.  Can recommend this hotel totally . We will definitely return.",5,2023,11,30
217,A spectacular escape,"We were delighted with a warm welcome and short chat at reception. Within minutes of being shown to our room by the charming Tatu, a sweet treat arrived – the receptionist having clearly noted we were visiting for our wedding anniversary. 

Our only plan for our child-free 24 hours was to relax and enjoy some quiet time. This was a breeze, with a quiet room and spectacular views out over the gardens and mountains beyond. The staff were consistently helpful and friendly, in a natural rather than rehearsed manner, and although this was easily our priciest stay in many years, the setting and quality of the hotel justified that.

If pressed for a negative, it would only be that the room A/C is perhaps a little noisy and the room service food, while really very good, wasn't quite the 'wow' you might expect for the prices. Also, having arrived at lunchtime, there wasn't really a casual option for dining until much later.

We very much hope to return as soon as we can.",5,2023,11,29
217,Lovely stay ,Beautiful night away - some wonderful stand out staff especially John who was stationed at the door and offered a very pleasant welcome as we came and went. Even dropped us into the village and provided a great chat on the way. Absolute gentleman and an asset to the hotel - thanks John ,5,2023,11,28
217,"Fantastic stay in a wonderful hotel. Really impressed with the staff, its obvious their training is first class. Thanks ","A birthday surprise for my better half.  Delivered flowers were in room on arrival. From front desk, bars restaurant, staff excellent, nothing too much trouble. Food excellent, service excellent.  Will be definitely returning. ",5,2023,11,28
217,Best hotel I have ever been to globally,"I have travelled within Europe, America, the Middle East and Africa, and Powerscourt Hotel was the best hotel I have ever been to. From the beautiful estate which the hotel is situated on to the remarkably kind staff, my stay far exceeded my expectations. I went with a few friends to celebrate my birthday, and because of this hotel I had an unforgettable experience. 

The room I stayed in was jaw-dropping. I booked a mountain view room so that I could see the mountains of Wicklow, and it made me realise how beautiful Ireland really is. I am a native of Ireland by the way, and have lived here for most of my life, so truly I was impressed! 

The staff were my favourite part of the stay. I have never met such kind and caring staff at a hotel. Ana helped me and my friends to check in, and her lovely smile made us feel welcome from the onset. Conor escourted us to our suite and also very kindly gave us a room tour. He explained how to operate the different parts of the room, such as the lights and heating, and I greatly appreciated that. Mossy met us at the door and made us feel like we were going to have a great stay immediately! His vibrant personality was so memorable. Both him (Mossy) and John also helped my friends and I to get bicycles for the cycle trail we did around the Powerscourt Estate. They explained the best trail to take and what to look out for. They also kindly took photos of my friends and I before we set off on the morning cycle. There were many more kind staff but I didn't get all of their names, however they really made me feel beyond welcome.

The food at the hotel is also brilliant! We dined at Sika Restaurant for both breakfast and dinner and everything we ate tasted fantastic.

All in all, I will definitely be coming back to Powerscourt Hotel. It is my new favourite spot in Ireland!

217,Powerscourt Hotel Is Absolutely Magical!,"I have been traveling to Ireland from the USA for the past 30+ years and have had the pleasure of staying in many of the nicest hotels and castles throughout the country. Powerscourt Hotel has become my most favorite hotel in Ireland and perhaps the world! It's an easy drive from Dublin Airport and the minute you enter the gates, the magic begins. The setting in the Wicklow mountains, which is referred to as 'the Garden of Ireland' is breathtaking. The hotel is absolutely beautiful and every room I have ever stayed in is luxurious. However the real jewels of this hotel are the staff. From the minute you arrive you are greeted by the nicest doormen who are so happy you have arrived. The front desk staff are lovely and will find the perfect room for you. The housekeepers are so kind and happy to give you extra coffee pods, really anything you need. There is a nice variety of restaurants to choose from and the nicest service from every single person you encounter.  The new Sally Gap restaurant/bar downstairs is a fun place to unwind, meet new friends, listen to music and have my new favorite drink, a 'passionfruit martini' (thanks Georgios and Ivan!).  We also took advantage of the spa, swimming pool and steam room in the evening and very nice there is no extra charge. We always end up spending most of our time at the hotel but when we venture out there is so much to do and see in Wicklow. The charming town of Enniskerry is 5 min away with cute shops and restaurants to explore as is Glendalough, the seaside town of Bray and the list goes on. Thank you Powerscourt for another magical stay and we shall see you soon!",5,2023,11,27
217,Huge disappointment ,"What a disappointing experience.  

Beautiful hotel. Beautiful rooms and the SPA staff are amazing. However, sadly, the praise stops there. 

Staff are poorly trained and unmotivated. Service and food really lacking. 

What a pity as service and food are two really important parts of the hospitality equation. 

Dinner was not remotely worth the price, nor was breakfast. The reception staff were rude on Friday evening. We constantly heard from staff about “systems” issues when things went wrong. Staff need training in how to communicate with guests. I was shocked at how poor some of the communication was in tone. 

We left early on Sunday having decided to skip breakfast. What was supposed to have been a very special weekend was one where our hopes and expectations were very largely unmet. 

I would not recommend this hotel at all. 

There is an evident lack of “heart” in the hotel (other than in the SPA staff who are fabulous).  

I wonder how long can the business be effective when it is being run like this?

I feel sad that such a beautiful hotel is not the pride and joy it should be and that the staff are unmotivated and poorly trained. Something has gone badly wrong. ",1,2023,11,27
217,Food is bad. Service is poor. Have dinner nearby in Enniskerry. Bad buffet Breakfast,"Fine to sleep in but not to eat in!
For a special occassion- go somewhere else.

1. Sika Restaurant menu at €80 per person should be a wow culinary experience. It is not even average quality and really disappointed which really put the trip off on a bad atart. For example, the menu offers a Lobster Salad. It arrives and you don't get a salad-leaves etc it is a yellow mouse type substance. The restaurant needs to go back to basics. Food needs to taste nice first and then worry about making the fancy pretty stuff. I got chocolate ice cream for dessert-thinking you can't go wrong. It was cheap ice cream that would make even Lidl ice cream seem fancy. 

2. €30 breakfast per person one might expect service. Nope. You have to fetch the medicore breakfast for yourself! Not even a nice buffet when you get there-cheap ingredients, poorly cooked -fried eggs with white mucus still on top. They could not even make toast right. It was soft warm bread not crunchy toast. 

What was meant to be a very special occassion was very disappointing. 
We won't be back.",1,2023,11,26
217,A little taste of heaven,"Stayed for one night in powerscourt and to say we were impressed does this luxurious hotel no justice. The staff were amazing and one thing really stood out,apart from the great food, amazing service, amazing spa facilities and comfortable room’s, the staff are so so friendly and genuinely happy. It was infectious 🤣. We will be definitely doing a two day break the next time. A must is a visit to the whiskey distillery to do the tour and tasting experience. They have a very knowledgable team and as mentioned above, they are also super cheerful and friendly. 
Thanks to the amazing team and see you all again soon.",5,2023,11,25
217,Absolute luxury ,"Just returned from a fabulous 2 night break with my husband in Powerscourt. Highly recommended, excellent staff and food, luxurious room and facilities. The renovated Sally Gap bar is an ideal place to unwind after a day's sightseeing. Looking forward to returning soon.",5,2023,11,23
217,Baby moon of dreams,"This was for our baby moon . As I’m heavily pregnant I was seeking out as much comfort as possible . And it was delivered in spades . We were granted an early check in and upgraded to a deluxe room.
The staff were all so friendly and helpful in every way . The room was beautiful and the bed so comfortable and my extra pillows were delivered to our room in minutes . A wonderful experience for a very special time for myself and my partner . ",5,2023,11,22
217,The Best Stay Ever!,"Recently stayed at the hotel with my best friend for a 2 night stay a bit of R & R.  From the time we stepped into the hotel till the time we left the whole experience was 5 star.  The girl on the front desk was so polite and helpful as was all the staff.  We had afternoon tea situated on a lovely table overlooking the gardens.  The staff explained each course and were so attentive.  Our suite was not ready when we arrived so the girl on reception came in to tell us when it was.  We had treatments later in the afternoon which were so relaxing and again staff so nice. Nothing is a hassle and they are all so helpful.  We dined in Sally Gap Bistro that night which has been done up since I was there before.  Saturday we walked the grounds and went to Avoca and took in all that is to offer on this little Gem of a retreat.  We dined later on that night in Sika restaurant which was so delicious and again had lovely waitress which was so attentive.  We had an amazing beautiful breakfast on the Sunday morning before check out.  The whole experience was so nice and felt much longer than the 2 days that we were there.  I would definitely recommend this hotel for any occasion as your sure to be pleased with what ever option you choose.  You wont be disappointed.  If you were to ask me what stood out the most apart from the whole experience being excellent it would have to be the staff for me, genuinely they have got to be the nicest staff I have ever come across in any hotel and they are a credit to the hotel.  Cant wait to return again.!! ",5,2023,11,22
217,Fabulous stay in wonderful hotel,"We had a fantastic night away in this wonderful hotel. Perfect for couples who want a break. The hotel was spotlessly clean and the welcome at the reception desk made us immediately feel at home. We spent some time walking the grounds and went for an early evening drink in the village which was lovely. The room was spacious and dinner in the hotel was excellent. Our waiter Dario was warm and attentive and the food was great. Highly recommend this hotel, staff warm, facilities top class and the whole experience was a joy. Thank you.",5,2023,11,21
217,Can’t wait for our next stay! ,"We had such a wonderful stay at Powerscourt last Friday! It was our 4th time staying here, and it never disappoints. The bar has been renovated since we were there last, and we had a fabulous dinner in the Sally Gap. There was also a band playing on Friday night, which added to the lovely atmosphere in the bar. 
We didn’t have spa treatments this time around, but we still relaxed so much in the pool/spa area. 
The staff couldn’t be more friendly and helpful, and we can’t wait to book our 5th trip to Powerscourt! ",5,2023,11,21
217," Can't say enough good things!","From the minute you drive into the estate it's like you've escaped into an entirely different world. The grounds are beautiful, especially when the sunlight hits everything in sight as the sun rises in winter. It was breathtaking. The hotel itself was decorated for Christmas, garlands and trees and lights adorning everywhere - it was beautiful and really set the tone for our trip. 

Everything from the bonus upgrade to a glorious suite, the pleasant and accommodating staff (I forgot my toothbrush!) to the giant chessboard outside was the epitome of luxury. 

It only went from great to better when we went to the spa for a massage. The facilities are modern, clean, user friendly, and my massage was top notch. 

Loved the Sika restaurant too - delicious food and great ambiance.",5,2023,11,20
217,Superb!,Entering the lobby this hotel offers a spacious and warm environment where hospitality reigns supreme.  The real beating heart of this hotel is its staff.  Jean greeted me during check-in in a very professional and efficient manner.  The afternoon tea overlooking the Sugarloaf and the excellent service provided by Ash and Lara was a very enjoyable time.  Not least the recently renovated Sally Gap Bar and the SPA.  Super recommended hotel!,5,2023,11,19
217,Incredible family stay full of fun and luxury,"We enjoyed a magical stay over Halloween mid-term as a family of 4. From the moment we arrived everything was perfect. Welcomed by the incredible Mossy, who gifted the children 2 lovely goodie bags full of treats and schedule of kids activities for our stay. From face painting, games room, trick or treat station, pool and park there was no shortage of things to do! 

Every staff member we met was so helpful and always a smile of their face.

We had dinner in Sally’s Gap-our first time since refurbishment. The atmosphere, food and service were lovely. Breakfast was beautiful too, with a little kids station which the children loved. 

There were special little touches at every corner. Our family suite was fabulous and daughter is already asking when we can go back!!",5,2023,11,19
217,One of our most memorable stay's,"Stunning location, one of the most beautiful hotels we have ever stayed at. Our room was amazing, the views were outrageous. 
We were greeted by Jean with a huge welcoming smile, she was very helpful. Tatu was a man of many talents, always there to help us with any of our needs!
Breakfast was very nice, plenty of options, everyday there was a special dish. The service was some of the best, Lorraine was spot on, she always had a smile on her face and was very helpful. Eva was also very helpful and always willing to help out.
The view was also spectacular for breakfast. 
The Japanese gardens are located above the hotel and were beautiful.
The experience was so nice that we returned for our last three nights in Ireland.

217,Wonderful ,"My husband and I had a wonderful stay at the end of October. We arrived early so that we could really take in the surroundings and loved the River Walk which hotel guests have complementary access to. Although we  were there during mid term time we felt as though we had the pool and sauna to ourselves thanks to the guidance of the staff and the generous hours of operation. Dinner was amazing in the new Sally Gap Pub and Restaurant and breakfast in the Sika Restaurant was a real treat. Service was thoughtful, attentive, unobtrusive and professional. The icing on the cake was an upgrade to a suite with balcony on a special anniversary. Having previously stayed in Powerscourt Hotel and loved the setting and facilities, this year the food, staff and service really elevated our visit even further. ",5,2023,11,13
217,Amazing Irish Hotel Experience,"This was our second visit to the property and the first as an Autograph Collection.
It continues to exceed our expectations. The facility is breathtakingly beautiful. Hotel decor and ambience are amazing. Our room was beautifully appointed and very well maintained. The furnishing and decor matched with the rest of the hotel. The front desk, housekeeping and food and beverage staff were professional and welcoming. It was worth the price and a delight in everyway. We cannot wait to go back!",5,2023,11,13
217,5 star Service all the way,"Recently stayed at the Powerscourt for the annual team awards. The hotel and team exceeded all expectations from the precheck in arrival email,  the warm welcome, fantastic drinks reception, and beautiful banquet.
The breakfast buffet had an excellent range to choose from, and the view while having a relaxing breakfast was second to none.
I would highly recommend this hotel, and I look forward to returning to explore more of what this dine Hotel has to offer as I did not get to experience the pool or spa on this occasion. ",5,2023,11,13

From the Doormen parking your car, to the ever smiling and helpful team to the amazing setting.  The Sallygap bar makes you never want to leave and the food and service are outstanding. Breakfast was also not to be missed one of the best out of all the luxury hotels we stayed at during our 3 week stay in Ireland.  The rooms are luxurious and so quiet we stayed on two occasions for over 7 nights.  Shout yourself a suite they are lovely.",5,2023,11,09

If your thinking of booking powerscourt hotel go for it . Its a 5 star and if I could give it 100/10 I would . See you soon powerscourt from a very happy couple.,5,2023,11,06
217,Flawless from start to finish,"I stayed here on October 30th with my wife and two daughters (2&4) for one night. From the second we walked in the door we were blown away, the lobby was transformed into a child friendly Halloween Mecca with a seperate kids check in area with popcorn sweets and hot chocolate. A truly unforgettable welcome that was topped only by Jean who then checked us in who went out of her way to make a big deal of our two daughters (who are still asking about her!). 

We had a family suite which is better than almost any hotel I've been in, huge space for the kids, and even better you can have your own space to watch a movie when they are gone to bed (kids movies and channels on TVs also a huge help). We ordered room service to the suite which arrived in 20mins and was delicious! 

The pool was maintained brilliantly, great hours for families and space in the evening for adults to chill out themselves. Breakfast the next morning also had a seperate kids table full of Halloween themed snacks. We took a walk around the grounds and used the playground as well as a games room setup just for the kids. 

All round exceptional in every way, the best hotel break we've had all year, they find the perfect balance of looking after the kids and the parents alike and the consistency of top class service was clear to see. Just excellent

217,Another amazing visit to my favourite hotel.,"For anyone looking to get away and actually switch off then go here ...even for 1 night. The whole experience from check in to check out is beyond any other hotel. 
All the staff are wonderful and you feel treated like royalty. 
I would recommend staying in one of the balcony rooms and really enjoying the amazing view.
These rooms are located on the same floor as the restaurants and for anyone with any mobility difficulties, this is a winner.
Highly recommend eating in either sika or the new Sally gap restaurant...both are incredible as is breakfast...which has the most choice I have ever seen including menu options.
This will always be the place I chose to go back to.",5,2023,11,05
217,Beautiful Afternoon Tea with a view,"We went to Powerscourt to celebrate a Birthday Afternoon Tea & it was amazing, staff were amazingly attentive to dietary requirements. The tea menu was gorgeous! I hadn't seen such a nice selection before.

We had a fabulous table overlooking the gardens and I honestly didn't want to leave.",5,2023,11,02
217,Amazing stay for a special occasion…,"We arrived at Powerscourt early afternoon and we were blown away by this hotel. The welcome from the staff and the hotel itself is just amazing. 
We were travelling as a family, myself and my partner with our 4 month old boy for a special night away with a plan up my sleeve! We had spent the morning calling at various places special to us in Wicklow. 

When we checked in our room was ready so we headed straight to it. We stayed in a Mountain View King Room which was ideal for us. Loads of room, great amenities and the bed was fab! After this we decided to grab a bite to eat for lunch. Only place serving was Sika which was fine for us. We were looking for just a light bite so not to spoil our dinner later on. The service in here was again 5 star. Quick service and the lunch was great. The staff made such a fuss of our little boy also which is always nice when visiting hotels with a little one. 
After this I had booked a treatment for my partner so she went off to the Espa Spa for that whilst I had a walk around the lovely gardens. My partner had an amazing treatment which she would highly recommend which was a 30min back neck and shoulder massage. 

After this that is where my plan of the whole day came to the final peice. In the amazing grounds of Powerscourt Hotel I proposed to my partner with our 4 month old by our side. It was such an amazing place to do this where it was just the 3 of us in the gardens of this great hotel. She said yes! 

After this a short swim in the amazing pool (first time swimming for our little boy) then on to the newly refurbished The Sally Gap Brasserie. Good and service 5 star and the way it has been furnished is amazing. Following this we went for a night cap to Sugar Loaf which again is a lovely setting. 

Breakfast the next day was in Sika and was buffet style which at first I was a little set back. With it been a 5 star hotel I thought it would have been waiter service. There was no need for me to be set back as the buffet was 5 star! 

Overall our experience at Powerscourt was an amazing one which was a great final stop on a great day building up to my proposal. We will definitely return to this hotel and would highly recommend.",5,2023,11,01
217,Amazing experience,What a fabulous hotel. We stayed here recently to celebrate a birthday and to treat ourselves. We chose one of the suites which came at a cost but it was absolutely beautiful. It had its own balcony with views of the gardens and mountains. The food was beautiful and staff were amazing.,5,2023,10,31
217,A Gem in Co-Wicklow ,"From the minute we entered the Powerscourt Hotel we were impressed, it is such a beautiful hotel. We were celebrating our wedding anniversary and we managed to secure a suite (which was luxurious, extra large bed, extra pillows, lovely plush sheets, marble bathroom, walk in wardrobe) it was pure luxury for us. When we arrived at our room, a member of staff knocked at the door and had a lovely anniversary card, Bulter’s chocolates as a surprise, it was a very lovely gesture by the hotel. The spa area and pool is the best that you will ever have at a hotel - it is outstanding. The whirlpool was amazing and the salt steam rooms & sauna. We spent at least 2/3 hours down there, as there was lovely loungers to lie out on. We got room service which was great and spent Saturday night in the Sally Gap Bar for a few drinks and listened to the live band playing. It was just lovely relaxing there after our wonderful afternoon at the spa & pool. The hotel is only a short walk to the Powerscourt Estate & Distillery so we were able to visit these and walk back to the hotel. The staff are amazing, very friendly and provide excellent customer service. We would highly recommend this hotel and as we checked out we were already looking forward to our next visit to this beautiful hotel. ",5,2023,10,31
217,Autumn Break,"This is such a beautiful and welcoming hotel , we were lucky to arrive to a gorgeous autumn afternoon, the scenery is stunning but the hotel was beautifully decorated to complement the surroundings. 
Our family room had a view of the sugar loaf mountain and was perfect. 
Every member of staff we met were so friendly and helpful we were made to Dee very welcome . 

We ate in the Sika restaurant and the food was delicious and we loved the”apple” dessert stunning!!
 We ended the evening in the Sugar Loaf bar which had a very enjoyable band on and we had a few cocktails. 
It was a lovely stay , cannot wait to return.",5,2023,10,31
217,10/10 Experience ,"My recent stay at Powerscourt Hotel was a remarkable experience. The staff's warmth and attentiveness made me feel truly valued, and the dining was exquisite, with diverse menu options that delighted my palate. The beautifully maintained grounds provided a serene backdrop for relaxation and leisurely strolls.

I also enjoyed an informative and enjoyable distillery tour during my stay. Plus, the proximity to the stunning waterfall, just minutes away, was a delightful bonus. In summary, Powerscourt Hotel offers a complete and unforgettable getaway with its exceptional staff, delectable cuisine, stunning grounds, and nearby attractions. I highly recommend it for a luxurious and enriching experience.

PS. The Hot Chocolate for Halloween in the foyer was such a nice treat",5,2023,10,31
217,Pure luxury at every turn,"Where do I even begin? This was a very special stay for me and my Mam. Before we even arrived staff at Powerscourt were going out of their way to accommodate us and make our stay as perfect as possible.

The hotel itself is incredible, beaten only by the wonderful service provided by every person we came in contact with. The Sally Gap bar is a gorgeous place to spend an hour or two enjoying a cocktail and we floated out of the Spa following amazing treatments.

The room was heaven, we didn't want to leave. Pristine and pure luxury, we are already counting down the days to our next stay.

Thanks to Eamon and all at Powerscourt for a 5* stay.",5,2023,10,31
217,For a 5 Star hotel - something missing!,"﻿Hotel is in excellent condition, staff attentive, grounds are well looked after, bedrooms are spacious and in excellent condition. - No fault could be found with the staff or facilities. 

My only criticism related to the lunch options. Bear in mind the hotel is 10+ minutes away from other venues. 

Lunch is either Afternoon tea or A La Carte Lunch option. Having booked the Sika Restaurant for dinner, we wanted something simple and low key (soup / sandwiches / wraps) so as we did not ruin our appetite. Unfortunately not available. 

Dinner at the Sika was excellent, staff very professional - call out to Daniel who served us. 

Would absolutely stay again but would have lunch before I arrive!

217,Superb experience!,"Family break including 2 young grandchildren. 
On arrival, our room was upgraded to a suite. Great start & this level of service continued throughout our stay.  Pool attendant very helpful & the area was managed attentively. Restaurant menu catered well for all & again the staff were professional & looked after all our family very well. Complimentary hot chocolate in reception very welcome especially after a walk to the playground & beautiful grounds. Lots of activities available which we intend to explore on our next visit. Yes, we will definitely be back. Thank you to all for ensuring our stay was perfect.",5,2023,10,29
217,Extraordinary hotel with great staff,"Everything about the hotel was extraordinary from the moment we drove through the grounds leading to the hotel entrance we knew this visit was going to be special.
We recieved a warm welcome at the reception and the staff throughout the entire hotel were  exceptionally amazing in providing the best possible service .
The suite was spacious and luxurious and the cleanliness of the rooms was first class which can also be seen throughout the hotel.
We dined in the restaurant which had a pleasant ambience that made us feel welcomed and relaxed .The food was outstanding and very well presented.
The staff were very accommodating at a moments notice.We continued our night in the bar and the atmosphere was great with a duo playing traditional music.
Next morning we had breakfast outside overlooking the gardens which were fantastic and amazingly maintained. 
The recreation areas were wonderful and the spa was unique with a swimming pool lined with crystals with the  soothing music and a calming atmosphere we could relax ,clear our minds and embrace deep relaxation. 
The oversized towels and robes were fluffy and absorbent which are perfect for spa guests .One negative about the steam room was the internal showers did not work ,outside though was a nice cold bucket of water to tipple over your head for a immediate cool down .
We would definitely stay here again.Extraordinary hotel with great staff .The location is just perfect and there is plenty to see and visit.

217,Stay at this first class hotel near Dublin,"We visit Ireland every year from the States. We try never to miss staying at Powerscourt in the Wicklow mountains. It is first class in every way. The views are outstanding. The staff goes above and beyond. You are greeted by 
“Mikey” with her top hat. Tatu and Mossi handle your bags with care and ease. 
Nermina, the restaurant hostess,welcomes you to what can only be described as an overwhelming breakfast area in the Sika restaurant. She is a real gem. 
The whole staff makes you feel that you have come “home”. 
You can’t go wrong staying here. 
Don’t miss the nearby village of Enniskerry.",5,2023,10,28
217,A bit disappointing.  Not a true 5 star. ,"Beautiful hotel,  but not 5 stars.  I’ve stayed at the property 6 times, and although lovely not the service you’d receive from a 5 star hotel.  No turn down service,  coffee machine that leaked all over the floor,  called several times for ice to be delivered to the room and never received it.  In addition, the management begrudgingly recognizes Marriott status.  The night before we were checking out, I asked for a late check out the next day.  As a titanium member,  unless the room is unavailable, this is a guarantee. The manager refused, even knowing the room would be available, due to low occupancy the next day.  I was told do come back the next morning,  and finally they agreed to the late checkout.  Not the attitude you’d expect.  Rather than an upgrade to best available, during check in they upgraded us to a next level.  Only after much conversation did they give us a Mountain View room upgrade. (Which was very nice). I felt that management did not want to recognize any Marriott loyalty. Unlike other Marriotts that go out of their way to be helpful.  
Remodeling McGills to the Sally Gap is a disappointment.  Sally Gap offers no warmth. Too bright.  Certainly not a welcoming atmosphere.  Use to love stopping into McGills for a light dinner or a nightcap.  
I’d like  to recognize the doorman John.  Who was very helpful and went above and beyond.  Very knowledgeable about the local area and always willing to help.  He was like a concierge, a true gem! 
The staff at breakfast and the quality of the food were very good.  
",4,2023,10,27
217,Old fashioned Irish hospitality at its best,"We had a wonderful time in this lovely hotel. We were upgraded to a suite which was enormous and very well appointed. The staff there are all very friendly and welcoming and any issues dealt with promptly and efficiently (i.e how to turn off the air conditioning). We dined both nights in the casual dining room and the food and wine were excellent, there is the choice to take the hotel shuttle bus into the nearby village of Enniskerry if you don't want to eat in the hotel but the weather was miserable so we chose to eat in. There is a great leisure centre comprising a pool, jacuzzi, steam and sauna and we enjoyed this experience very much. This is old fashioned Irish hospitality at its best. We will definitely return.",5,2023,10,27
217,Best Anniversary present,"We booked here for our wedding anniversary as a treat to ourselves. From arrival to checkout we had an amazing experience. We had booked the standard king room which we were excited about but got upgraded to a suite when we checked in so excitement level went up again and when we saw where we’d be staying “wow” everything was to the highest standard in decor and cleanliness. We had a drink in lobby which is so good for relaxing and watching the world go by. Dinner was in the Sally Gap Brasserie, we had wagu burger and Steak, couldnt fault anything and service was amazing. Had best nights sleep in a hotel ever thanks to the most luxurious bed and bedding. 
Yes this hotel is expensive to stay, eat and drink compared to others but you’re definitely paying for the experience and to be made feel a little special so to me it was worth it. ",5,2023,10,25
217,Nice brief stay.,"Took a night out of the hum-drum and spend our anniversary at the hotel. Booked one of the Classic king Suites and really, it should be standard. everyone should indulge and enjoy the space and luxury.
After arrival, took time out in the pool to unwind. A very calm space, a bit like a library where guests know to just chill.
Had dinner in the Sika Restaurant and it is a little bit special. 
The only negative on the stay was a mis-behaving AC unit in the suite. I let reception know and they tried to rectify. It was not resolved and I think it needed a deeper dive, but Eamon (Director of Operations) took all the details and will follow-up. I was impressed by how seriously it was taken. Sometimes things are go awry and it is the response that makes the difference.",4,2023,10,19
217,Beautiful Hotel,"We enjoyed our stay a Powerscourt Hotel.  It is set in beautiful landscape with wonderful and helpful staff.  Would highly recommend to all visitor but would be best to arrange a car as it is set far off the road.
I look forward to my next visit.",5,2023,10,13
217,Extremely disappointing,"Disappointed from the minute we entered. The entrance room was cold with no atmosphere1 no music, no fires lit: it was pretty dead to be honest.
Receptionists and spa staff just didn’t come across as genuine or overly friendly.

We waited over an hour for a table that we booked and the food in sallys gap was very very disappointing 

£450 for one nights stay NOT WORTH IT at all. Won’t be back.",1,2023,10,10
217,Birthday,Me and my husband stayed here last summer and it was the best 2 days we’ve spent away in any hotel in Ireland. It was my husband’s 40th Birthday and everyone from the receptionist to the waiting staff to the concierge went above and beyond t make our stay very memorable. Will be back here without a doubt!,5,2023,10,05
217,Lovely setting and hotel and exceptional staff!,We have stayed here a number of times as the setting is lovely and the location very well placed for visiting Dublin and Wicklow. This stay was our best yet. A number of areas have been refurbished and the atmosphere is much more contemporary and casually elegant and the staff were exceptional. We had a fabulous stay and will be back!,5,2023,10,03
217,Powerscourt Heaven! ,"We had a wonderful family vacation at Powerscourt Hotel last month. The trip was a once in a lifetime experience,  and I fall asleep at night dreaming of being back in such a luxurious resort! The staff is outstanding, all around!  Shout out to Sami, from the Sally Gap Bar. He made us feel welcome right away, and had us returning nightly throughout our stay to enjoy not only the one of a kind cocktails, but the fabulous company as well! We were with a big wedding party, and the bartenders at Sally Gap made sure the night was one we would never forget. Thank you, Powerscourt staff for an awesome time! We are already dreaming up our next visit! ",5,2023,10,02
217,"Amazing, restaurant over priced, breakfast fab.","Amazing location, excellent breakfast, beds amazing! It’s been the reason we are three time return visitors! However, it may be our last due to the restaurant and the over priced menu! Such a shame they changed the bar menu to one that has €32 for a chicken dish!! It’s outside mosts people’s budget but maybe that’s what they want!! The location is fabulous and having the golf course and shops on site make is an excellent choice for a destination weekend. Spa beautiful but again over priced! Facial €150, no price on website before booking. Treatment was lovely but €150 for hours work !!  NO.. it’s just too much. Will I return.. will have to try find another triple room for my girlfriends and I that is on par - which I think will be difficult to do.",5,2023,10,01
217,Expectations Matched,We were delighted to have been upgraded on arrival.  The whole experience was perfect . The quality of our room beamed. Relaxation in the tranquility Spa helped us unwind before dinner in the Sally Gap Restaurant. The staff from Sive at reception and throughout our stay were so nice and professional. It left us planning a longer revisit.,5,2023,09,30
217,Skip dinner at the Sally Gap Bar,"We recently stayed at the Powerscourt hotel and decided to have dinner at the Sally Gap bar rather than face the squall outside. 

I made a reservation for 7:00 pm. We arrived promptly and there were very few folks in the restaurant. They seated us at the high top by the kitchen. 

We ordered drinks, the burrata appetizer, the goat cheese salad and the wagyu burger to share. 

For a hotel charging close to $500 for a one night stay, I had higher expectations than what we experienced. 

The burrata was served cold - I have always had it at room temperature.  It came with cold brown bread which wasn’t a good match for the cheese. The burrata had little to no flavor at all. 

The goat cheese salad was better as was the burger but I have had much better food for far less money. I guess we paid for the convenience of staying in. 

The ambiance was mediocre because of where we were sitting. It was exceptionally loud between the kitchen and the bar. I was grateful for the quiet we experienced as soon as we left the restaurant side. The bar side was empty and I wish we had been seated there. 

I would not recommend the restaurant if leaving the premises is a possibility.",2,2023,09,27
217,A Perfect Weekend,"We have been dreaming of coming to the Powerscourt Hotel and Gardens for the past 6 years. My friend and I love nature, love beauty and quality. We are working Moms who enjoy a  little get-away to re-charge our batteries.

Powerscourt Hotel and Gardens ticked all those boxes. The venue is stunning and exudes quality and luxury in every detail. Every single staff member was kind, polite, welcoming, genuine and always happy to help. 

The room was gorgeous, luxurious, spacious, peaceful and comfortable. The bed and bedding were amazing. I slept so well. The mini bar is full of quality treats and products. 
Waking up with a Nespresso coffee made it a great start to my day ;-) 
In the afternoon, after visiting the gardens, we enjoyed a cup of tea by the fire. At Aperitif time, we savoured a cocktail whilst enjoying the view on Sugar Loaf mountain. 
We had dinner at the Sally Gap restaurant. The food was delicious and the service kind and efficient. 
It felt like an escape from the fast paced life, where we were able to fully relax and enjoy the moment. 
What made it so special, was that perfect combination of luxury and the kindness of the Powerscourt people. Thank you to every team member of the Powerscourt hotel who made our stay so special. ",5,2023,09,26
217,The sally gap bar and restaurant,"I just recently visited the sally gap bar located in the powerscourt hotel, my experience was such a delight. I was on time for my reservation but decided to have a drink at the bar first I felt no pressure by the staff to go to my table. The menu in my opinion could have a few more options but I went with the aranchi and 10oz steak- cooked perfectly, everything came out at standard time and I was never left waiting for anything. George, my server was amazing!! he had a great humour was very helpful very kind,and gave me some great recommendations . He recommended the dessert I had which turned out to be amazing! The staff were all so professional and friendly all smiling, the bar man vadim is the best mixologist! the nonalcoholic pornstar martinis are a dream! I am beyond satisfied with my experience and will 100% be returning while also recommending this restaurant to friends and family, Thankyou to George and all the lovely staff here at powerscourt!

217,Best Hotel and Gardens in Ireland,"The Powerscourt Hotel was our absolute favorite place during our trip to Ireland.  We traveled as a family of 3 (no small children).  The hotel was fabulous and the grounds were absolutely gorgeous.  Check-in was a breeze.  Rooms were beyond spacious and so elegant.  The grounds were breathtaking.  The breakfast was very nice with a lot of options.  The dinner at Sika was the only disappointment.  I think they were going for fine dining and it just fell short.  Would definitely recommend to anyone visiting Ireland.
Take the time to visit the Powerscourt Gardens next door.  I wish we had another day just to take in more of the beauty.  I didn't want to leave!",5,2023,09,24
217,First class experience,"First thing you notice on arrival at Powerscourt Hotel is the friendliness of the staff.  Check in was fast and efficient.  We were extremely lucky to be upgraded and the room was fabulous.  Your order was taken quickly in the restaurants and the delicious food served swiftly.Nothing was a problem to the staff, they were just brilliant.  The swimming pool was an area of peaceful relaxation. Our best stay ever in a hotel of this calibre.  The 5 star rating is well deserved.  Thank you so much to all the staff at Powerscourt Hotel. 👏👏",5,2023,09,24
217,Simply the best,A W E S O M E !! Our stay here was the best ever experience in a hotel … Surroundings where breathtaking … the faculties top notch … The SERVICE was as good as you would expect …. OUT OF THIS WORLD …!! Every part of our visit from the first person who greeted us a the door .. through check in … the staff servicing and helping carry our bags …. A W E S O M E,5,2023,09,24
217,Very pleasant experience in a beautiful part of the country ,"I wanted to visit Ireland but wanted a combination of activity and low-key reprieve.  Staying here at Powerscourt was a great choice as it allows you to zip into Dublin for sightseeing and shopping, but locally you can walk to the picturesque Powerscourt Gardens and a short taxi ride to the waterfall.   We also arranged (through the hotel) a day trip out west to the Cliffs of Moher, which allowed me to see a bit more of the country.

The hotel spa is also wonderful.  I went on two occasions- the first I had Colette for a body treatment and she was such a pleased and the treatment was fantastic; and then I had a facial and massage with Bushra who also was super nice and gave fantastic treatments!  Then we had tea at the spa cafe.  Altogether a relaxing and renewing experience.",5,2023,09,24
217,Incredible Stay at the Powerscourt Hotel,"We had an absolutely spectacular stay at the Powerscourt Hotel.  It was my Wife’s birthday and the staff went above and beyond to make our stay special.  From the beautiful room, to the chocolates at turndown service, to the amazing pool and spa area, it was incredible.

A highlight of the stay was our meals at the Sally Gap Bar and Brasserie.   On both nights of our stay, Fernanda was one of the best hosts we’ve ever had at a restaurant.  She was friendly and engaging - and also helped find the perfect dishes and drinks for my Wife’s gluten allergy.   We can’t say enough how incredible Fernanda was - such a highlight of our trip! Thank you thank you thank you Fernanda!",5,2023,09,22
217,"Best Hotel Experience, Ever!","I am writing this review to express my gratitude and that of my husband and all of our guests for the outstanding service that we encountered during our stay at The Powerscourt Hotel Resort and Spa.  

Our daughters wedding was held at The Powerscourt Estate which is only a few minutes walk from the hotel.   We had 125 guests attending our special occasion and many of them booked into this amazing hotel for 1-3 nights.  

From the moment we arrived, the staff was incredibly friendly and accommodating.  So many of the hotel's employees went out of their way to ensure that everyone’s stay was comfortable, enjoyable and definitely memorable.  

Their attention to detail and willingness to go above and beyond was truly remarkable.

217,Disappointed,"Rooms are beautiful and very spacious. 
Spa was disappointing - not to the standard of Galgorm Spa resort. 
Food acceptable but not exceptional. 

Unable to comment on golf or gardens as weather was poor. 

Not sure I would return as other hotels have better spa facilities.",3,2023,09,21
217,A world class experience,"My husband and I stayed here for two nights in September. We had an amazing time. This hotel is truly 5 star with great accommodation, service and food. We enjoyed leisurely lunches on the terrace of the Sika restaurant overlooking the gorgeous gardens and it was world class. In the evening we also enjoyed our own terrace which was private with great views. The room was very spacious and the bathroom was luxurious. My husband has limited mobility and at no time did we feel impeded by any of the facilities, which is to be applauded. Well done Powerscourt Hotel and thank you. We felt very spoiled and left feeling totally relaxed. We will be back soon.",5,2023,09,19
217,"Nice hotel, slipped on service though","Pros:  reception staff and John on door very helpful
Location and grounds lovely, next to Powerscourt House and Gardens
Pool and hot tub at hotel and very clean, child and adult hour specifically.
Staff at spa on counter desk very friendly.
Cons:  Room 551 has a stain on it or some sort of discoloured mark the size of a body:  not relaxing to enter and step on this!  Stayed two nights and room wasn’t refreshed with new coffee, dirty cups left etc.  I did receive new towels though after calling twice to have my room serviced.  Not what you would expect for a hotel ranked at this level.  More of a “wedding destination” and definitely caters to this mindset.  Disappointed for sure yet the grounds were lovely! ",4,2023,09,19
217,"Relax, unwind and recharge","My wife and I were greeted on arrival with glasses of cold lemonade (as it was unseasonably hot). Noemi, at reception, was a breath of fresh air. We were checked in quickly, professionally and courteously. She provided us with all the information we needed (as well as a welcome pack showing a map of the estate). Our room was on the 3rd floor and had a wonderful spacious balcony overlooking the rear gardens and the distant mountains. 
We had booked a whiskey and food pairing tour at the nearby Powerscourt Distillery for 4pm. Thankfully, the hotel granted us an early check-in, which allowed us to freshen up before heading to the distillery( as short walk from the hotel and well worth a visit).

Our room was spacious, spotless and so very comfortable. Nespresso machine(with selection of coffee), tea, water(sustainable packaging) and some locally sourced cookies provided for guests. A small honesty bar was also well stocked. 

We had booked dinner in the Sika restaurant. Although the wine we had chosen wasn't available, a suitable alternative was recommended. It didn't disappoint. Starters, mains and desserts  were plated artistically. Each course was an explosion of taste, complemented by the soft lighting and views across the gardens. The staff were perfectly attentive. 

After dinner we sat and enjoyed our surroundings in the Sugar Loaf lounge. As it was such a balmy evening, we retired to our room and decided to take advantage of our balcony. Sitting there under a cloudless sky, sipping an 18year Fercullen and a glass of wine, was pure relaxation.

After a great nights sleep we again ventured to the Sika restaurant, which looked like a different place having had its ""breakfast room"" makeover. Needless to say, every possible taste was catered for.

Before checking out we had a stroll around the estate, a quick visit to the garden centre, Avoca, a walk around the house etc. We left feeling relaxed and recharged.

That was the best place to celebrate our wedding anniversary. 
Thank you for a gift & card on the arrival.",5,2023,09,11
217," A little bit of heaven ",I've stayed a few times in Powerscourt and it is just an amazing hotel. Staff are so professional. The rooms are beautiful and the beds and pillows are seriously comfy. Food is also very good but found that there could have been more choice on the menu in the Sally Gap. They also didn't have the two beverages I had requested (orchard thieves and west coast cooler) so felt it could be better stocked. However the new bar is very nice and open. Breakfast is also delicious and lots of choice. The grounds of this hotel are immaculate and makes this hotel next level. Can't wait to stay again,5,2023,09,10
217,Amazing!,"We had previously stayed in Powerscourt a few times before but decided to book a mountain view room for our anniversary.  When we arrived we were given an upgrade to a mountain view suite with balcony which was amazing! The staff throughout the hotel were exceptional, from check-in to restaurant and bar staff and housekeeping.  All the restaurants had delicious food and all staff were fully aware of details of what was being offered. A nice touch in the Sika restaurant, on the Friday evening for dinner, we were presented with chocolates to celebrate our anniversary (a little note was added to our reservation on check-in:) ) The hotel is stunning & its surroundings even more so. Thank you to everyone who made our stay memorable and perfect. We will certainly be back!",5,2023,09,07
217,A Magnificent Hotel,"We had the privilege of staying at the Powerscourt Hotel in Ireland.  Though we traveled throughout the country and stayed at many fine hotels, the Powerscourt was heads and tails above the others.  The room are large and done beautifully (and everything works!).  The staff, especially Anna and Laszlo, were very attentive and genuine.  The bed and pillows were remarkably comfortable.  The Silka Restaurant was good and the bar even better.  We walked into Enniskerry and had a great lunch at one of the local restaurants and were picked up by the hotel.  All told, this may be the finest hotel we have ever stayed in.  I should also mention the golf course.  We played the East course (the West is said to be tougher) and it was challenging, beautiful and well maintained.  ",5,2023,09,05
217,Overcharged and let down,"Overcharged and let down

We stayed in this hotel in may this year to celebrate our wedding anniversary.
We had a lovely suite overlooking the gardens/woods any everything was fine. To be honest, I expected this due to the cost involved in staying at this hotel. The problem arose at check out where we were presented with a bill which included three overcharges amounting to 450 euro. I questioned the bill with the lady at reception and it took 45 minutes to sort it out. During this time she went in and out of the office, I now know that that was to talk to a manager, I also know that the lady I dealt with was inexperienced, so I ask why did the manager ‘hide’ in the office for 45 minutes?. It was quite a stressful experience and in fact ruined our positive experience.
When I spoke to the general manager he told me that their checking system had not worked in my case and he was sorry. I pointed out that even when the amount was removed from my bill, I felt it was presented to me in a style of ‘well you got away with it’. The initial manager offered me a discount on my next stay, the general manager, upon hearing that we were staying at a sister hotel said he would organise champagne for us in Mount Juliet. No such thing was organised and we now fell very let down.
The reason why I give this hotel a one star review is that the whole experience at check out and subsequently with the general manager has left a bad taste with us. Our two nights ended up costing €2100, not an inconsiderable amount and we are very disappointed.

217,The most fabulous hotel experience,"This was one of the best hotel experiences I have ever had and I can’t wait to return.   From the moment we entered the estate right up to our last visit to the Powerscourt Waterfall.  The twin room (these were 3/4 beds not single!) was incredible and beds were super comfy. The room was decorated in calming relaxing colours, it was hard to leave.  A massive walk in wardrobe and huge bathroom which had a separate toilet and shower.  We dined in the Sally Gap, so did not need to eat from a set menu.  I ate the most delicious veg. Burger.  I loved the adult only swim in the morning (7-9am) followed by a steam!  Then breakfast - definitely include this in your booking.  All needs and tastes were met!  We were even given to go boxes to take away pastries for later.  The staff were so friendly yet professional, nothing was a bother  - I wish all hospitality staff were like this.  

I can honestly say there was nothing to fault with this hotel, it was worth every €€€. ",5,2023,09,02
217,One of the best hotel experiences I have ever had,"The setting for this hotel is stunning, the Sugar Loaf mountain as a backdrop to the immaculate cultivated garden scenery is one of the best anywhere in the world. The hotel itself is impressive with lovely decor and ambience everything is  set for the guests comfort. The food was delicious as was the breakfast which can only be described as a feast with wide variety of high quality hot and cold options. The staff were so friendly approachable and efficient with special thanks to the gentleman who returned my wallet I had dropped in car park direct to my room. Our room a suite booked as part of the midweek pass offer was a complimentary upgrade that absolutely delighted us, it was huge, beautiful, impressive bathroom, super comfortable bed excellent amenities and spotless. This hotel was one of the best hotel experiences my husband and I have ever had we received a pass for the Powerscourt House gardens which are an incredible must see. I would whole heartedly recommend this hotel to any type of traveller",5,2023,08,31
217,"Sika yes, but skip Sally Gap unless you are very patient","As returning guests it was nice to receive an upgraded room and we couldn’t fault the reception team or the room. 
The Sika restaurant was delicious and well worth the cost on night 1.  
Night two in the new Sally Gap bistro was somewhat different. Seated at 6.30pm in the new decor was delightful, prompt prawn starter straight from the fridge was nice, the breads also nice. The 60 minute wait for one steak and a wagu burger was poor, and two other tables were less than pleased with their very slow service. 
Steak was nice, burger not recommended, average at best and the little pot of vegetables was cold. 

Waiting staff a little out of their depth but pleasant nonetheless. 

Suggest you have a lovely meal in Sika but go elsewhere for an evening meal. Perhaps the Golf Club nearby which friends reported to be excellent recently.",4,2023,08,30
217,Exceptional ,"Exceptional hotel! Eamon and the team have done a fantastic job, from check in to check out the staff were on thier A game. We had top class quality food in the newly renovated Sally Gap where both of us had the rib eye which was cooked to to medium-rare as requested. The decor oozed class. The food was served without delay and was hot on arrival. The service was excellent. (Hat tip to Matthew who looked after our table).
Pool and spa area was just what we needed. (It was rare trip away from our hyper active 2 year old and the calmness/serenity of the spa setting was just the tonic we needed). There is something dreamy about the Wicklow countryside and the Powerscourt hotel experience compliments its surroundings and peaceful environment perfectly. 

We will definitely be back.

Thank you for a great stay,
Conor ",5,2023,08,28
217,Brilliant!,"Another brilliant stay!  We are repeat guests-beautiful hotel, fabulous rooms, great breakfast fare with excellent staff.  We will return!  Each year we come with family and I would say that even with the vegan members of the family everyone had delicious fare!  Grounds are well maintained and common areas are pristine!",5,2023,08,21
217,"Great bar, shoutout to Benjamin!","After a lovely dinner in town, we went to the newly opened Sally Gap bar downstairs, great service and cocktails, a special mention to Benjamin who was so attentive and friendly! This is our second time here and can’t wait to come back, such a lovely place but the staff really make it !",5,2023,08,20
217,If you want to live a fairytale - this is for you.,"WOW!  Just WOW!  This hotel does not disappoint.  We stayed 21 days in Ireland with family and this was our favorite stay.  The magic begins as you are driving the road to the hotel.  This is something right out of a fairytale.  Sweeping views of the Wicklow Mountains in the background with green fields and horses in the foreground.  As you enter the gates to the hotel, you get a sense of the grander you are about to experience.  The staff greet you with a warmth and professionalism that is hard to come by in these times of staff shortages and overtaxed employees.  The reception area is splendid.  The decor is up-to-date but also classic.  We were shown to our room and bags were brought up to our room for a no hassle experience for us.  The room was bright, decorated lovely and comfortable.  The bathroom was spacious and so clean that it looked brand new.  We walked the grounds and were amazed by the care in which the gardens are attended.  Absolutely no detail was missed.  We had a drink in the bar after our walk.  The presentation, service and quality of the drink were exceptional.  We had dinner in the Douglas.  The brown bread was the best we had in Ireland.  I came home and was delighted to find the recipe from this hotel on-line.  The food was perfectly cooked, presented and had little touches of fine dining though the atmosphere was casual.  We had a wonderful sleep in beds that you can sink into.  The morning breakfast had good variety and staff are attentive to requests as well as refilling coffee/tea at the table.  We toured the Powerscourt House in the morning and were only a 10 minute walk away.  There are many amenities, including an outstanding spa.  I was able to exchange money at the reception desk during my stay which was an unexpected perk.  We stated two days and wished we had more time at this beautiful place.  Check out was effortless.  Though we were not traveling with small children this time, I would feel comfortable doing so as the cleanliness standards and service should be what other hotels strive to meet.  Wonderful experience - absolutely would love to stay here again.  ",5,2023,08,20
217,A special place ,"The setting and sense of spaciousness are delightful.  The building, furnishings, food, and service are of the highest order.  Great walks and activities nearby.  A place to enjoy and return in all seasons.",5,2023,08,20
217,Stunning,"I recently stayed with my daughter and we had a really amazing experience from start to finish. The room was stunning, we booked a suite.  This was the most comfortable bed I’ve ever slept in.  The room was was a lovely size and we really felt at home.  I would recommend adding the strawberries on your arrival.  They are unreal, possibly the best we’ve ever tasted .  This trip was a special treat for my young daughter, and also her first trip away.  I was really impressed with the children’s menu, the selection was great and the food as so good.  I went for the vegan option and was also really impressed. The staff are really friendly and professional. The play ground was perfect, and has a large chess set for any budding enthusiasts.  The grounds are stunning , with bikes on offer, which I would recommend to explore.   Also, I would recommend the river walk, we ended up in the river because my travel companion is five and it was so much fun, I would recommend a picnic for this as you could make an afternoon of it on a fine day
We also explored the gardens and again they were beautiful, with lots of really pretty areas to take photos.
We will  100% be returning and look forward to our next adventure.  Memories were made….

217,Our favourite family getaway in Ireland,"⭐⭐⭐⭐⭐

We recently had the most wonderful stay at Powerscourt Hotel for three nights in August. From start to finish, our experience was absolutely exceptional, leaving us with unforgettable memories. We try to stay once a year (twice if we are lucky!) - but it had been two years since we had stayed as a family of four.

One of the highlights of our stay was the spa treatment I received from Gabriel. It was nothing short of excellent! His skill and attention to detail truly made the experience relaxing and rejuvenating. The spa facilities were top-notch, and the serene ambiance added to the overall tranquility.

We were amazed by the level of service we received, especially when we had to make a last-minute booking change. The staff handled it seamlessly, and we truly appreciated the hassle-free process.

Dining at the Douglas was an absolute delight. The food was beyond delicious, and the variety of options catered to every member of our family. The culinary experience was one of the highlights of our trip.

Our family suite was simply fantastic. Spacious, luxurious, and tastefully decorated, it provided us with the perfect retreat after a day of exploring. And the view from our suite was breathtaking! Waking up to such beauty was a treat in itself.

Overall, Powerscourt Hotel once again exceeded our expectations in every way. The combination of exceptional service, remarkable dining, a stunning suite, and the serene spa experience made our stay truly special. This getaway was exactly what our family needed, and we're already looking forward to returning in the future. Thank you, Powerscourt Hotel, for an unforgettable experience that will stay with us forever!",5,2023,08,19
217,Can't do better,"This hotel is amazingly good.  It's in Wicklow so it has the benefit of being close to lots of outdoor activities, like the Sugar Loaf and Powersourt Waterfall while being close enough to towns like Enniskerry.  I stayed for a long weekend with my family which meant 5 rooms for 8 adults and 2 children.  
All the rooms were great and the ones on the south side had a fantastic view of the Sugar Loaf.  My two year old nephew was very disappointed that he no longer had a mountain view after he returned home.  Breakfast was an event each morning and the staff had no problem arranging a table for 10.  Dinner in the Sika restaurant (aka the fancy restaurant) was delicious.  Despite being fully booked, according to the woman who handled our checkout, the common areas, including breakfast and the pool, did not seem crowded.  
I like everything about Powerscourt but the best thing has to be the staff.  They were very helpful every time we asked for something and they have mastered the difficult art of always being there when you need them but not disturbing you when you don't.
This is the second time I've organised a family break in Powerscourt and I hope to do it again next year.  In fact when I suggested we try might somewhere different this year my six year old nephew was dissappointed.",5,2023,08,17
217,What's not to like about Powerscourt?,"We celebrated our Wedding Anniversary (well over 40 years!) in Powerscourt and enjoyed every minute. Super room, good dining in both dining rooms, lovely staff. Especial word of thanks to Seán Gaughran in The Douglas, to the young black receptionist in Reception (very regretfully I can't remember her name - sorry) and Michaela, also in Reception, who was so welcoming and helpful to us.
One miner quibble is that the dining rooms did not have fresh fish or shellfish on the menus - it's just that I do love them!
Stunning hotel, surroundings and scenery. What's not to like?",5,2023,08,17
217,Elegant and comfortable,"Elegant and luxurious but not pretentious in any way.

Very spacious rooms and the food was cooked to perfection.

Proximity to some beautiful parts of the country make it an ideal location for a short or long break.",5,2023,08,15
217,A Surprise Birthday ,"Nestled amidst nature's embrace, Powerscourt emerges as a haven of tranquility and rejuvenation, a true testament to luxury and relaxation. My recent visit, which also doubled as a surprise birthday celebration, left an indelible mark on my senses and soul. From the moment I stepped foot into the elegant lobby, I knew this experience would be nothing short of extraordinary.

The staff orchestrated a symphony of warmth and hospitality from the very start. The surprise birthday celebration I had planned for my dear friend was executed flawlessly. The sheer joy and surprise on her face illuminated the entire room, setting the tone for an incredible stay.

The heart and soul of Powerscourt undoubtedly lies within its spa and wellness facilities. The array of holistic treatments transported us to a realm of pure bliss. From indulgent massages that kneaded away every ounce of stress to revitalizing facials that left our skin aglow, each experience was meticulously crafted to perfection. 

One cannot discuss Powerscourt without mentioning its culinary offerings. The on-site restaurant was a delightful exploration of flavors, with a diverse menu that catered to both the health-conscious and those seeking a touch of indulgence. Every meal was a sensory delight, as we savored dishes crafted with the finest ingredients, presented with artistic flair.",5,2023,08,14
217,Great place to see the green of Ireland without having to travel far from Dublin,"We received a lovely upgrade to a suite and enjoyed our stay at Powerscourt Hotel. The area is gorgeous and certainly worth a visit if you want to see more of Ireland than Dublin, but don't have a lot of travel time. 

Our suite was very large and comfortable. It included a private porch, kitchen, dining area, sitting room and big bathroom with a large soaking tub and separate shower. 

We enjoyed the spa with its beautiful view of the lawn and Wicklow Mountains. It also has a great indoor pool with hot tub and a sauna and steam room with cold water buckets. The mens and womens upstairs spa facilities have separate areas with really powerful hot tubs and steam rooms. 

While the weather wasn't great we could still make the best of things by visiting neighboring Avoca for quality Irish made products and art. Don't miss Powerscourt Gardens. It is completely worth the trip, even if you aren't a ""garden person"" it will make your jaw drop. 

Take the hotel staff's advice and don't try to walk or bike to the waterfall. The roads are narrow, windy and uphill part of the way. Hire a taxi instead. The waterfall might not be the highest you've ever seen, but it is still impressive and very beautiful after a summer rain.

We also recommend the falconry experience. The local falconer brought three birds and was very knowledgable. It is reasonably priced relative to others we looked into and a great setting to do falconry.",5,2023,08,14
217,Anniversary Retreat!,"From the moment we arrived we were impressed, the bright entrance accompanied by a lovely old Jaguar XJS was certainly welcoming! We were warmly received in reception by the staff and shown to our room but it was hard to ignore the Sugar Loaf Lounge on our way with a breathtaking view of the Sugar Loaf Mountain and hotel gardens. Our room was gorgeous we knew straight away we picked the right place to spend our anniversary, we had chocolates and a message of congratulations from the hotel awaiting us in our room which we thought was a lovely touch. Our room was wonderful, the decor was beautiful and the quality of the materials was evident throughout. We had the best night sleep we have ever had, the bed was to die for, such a comfortable mattress with the fluffiest of pillows! The bathroom was a lovely space to unwind whether in the bath or shower we felt we could really relax here! Waking up to a view of the Sugar Loaf from our bed was memorable too, we could have sat there all morning! Overall we loved the room it was just gorgeous and we were sorry to have to leave it, it gave us the chance to really recharge and relax in lovely surroundings. The service throughout our stay was excellent, from room service to cocktails in the Sugar Loaf Lounge and Breakfast in the Sika Restaurant we were carefully attended to at all times and our needs were met and exceeded by the staff. The Breakfast was particularly impressive, we loved the quality and variety of breakfast options available and it certainly set us up for a busy day enjoying the surroundings such as the Powerscourt Waterfall and walking through the Sally Gap. The stay was a fantastic experience which I could not recommend highly enough. Myself and my girlfriend had a wonderful time here and look forward to making many more happy memories here in the future.",5,2023,08,14
217,You Will Want to Stay Longer!,"Powerscourt Hotel could not have been a more perfect spot for our family this August. We were able to explore the Wicklow Mountains and many hikes using Powerscourt as our home base, but just spending time on the property was a wonderful retreat. 
The staff, from our arrival to departure, took such great care of us. Perfect suggestions for the local area and complimentary transportation down into town made everything so easy for our holiday visit.
The rooms were the quietest and most comfortable rooms we have stayed in... perhaps ever!  We slept so well and shook off the jet lag quickly.
We had a sumptuous breakfast buffet each morning, enjoyed dinner on site, and relished tea and scones one afternoon!  It was difficult to leave.
Being adjacent to the historic Powerscourt House and Gardens was the icing on top. We strolled the gardens and enjoyed lunch there as well.
Our stay at Powerscourt Hotel has us adjusting how soon we want to return. We will be back and stay a bit longer!",5,2023,08,10
217,Well done,"I had a pleasant stay at the Powerscourt hotel and I highly recommend this place. A big thank you for staff reception the guys who was working at Saturday night very helpful who provided a very pleasant welcome.

Thank you for your kindness you were very helpful from the moment I arrived until it was time for me to leave.I were delighted. I had a great experience with the whole team at reception , you are incredible, you were a great help! This hotel is perfect because it is close to all the main attractions. I couldn't recommend this place any more, I will definitely come back! Thank you for everything!

And I'm so disappointed by the concierges who worked on Monday morning, he was so rude to my driver and, I don't know what's going on with my driver before, but in front of me, he spoke very badly with him and he wants him to leave the place and the guy he is my driver came from far away, but she wasn't nice to him

Kind regards,

217,Spectacular hotel,"There is no doubt at all that this hotel is a truly spectacular one. The staff are friendly. The breakfast had such a variety of choice and plenty of healthy options.Dinner in the Douglas was delicious with a lovely intimate relaxed setting and attentive staff. The bedroom was large and comfortable  with a separate dressing area. Even though we loved this hotel and are hoping to return again , I have to mention one incident that disappointed  us. The coffee machine in the room was leaking. I discovered it twenty minutes after we checked in. I immediately phoned reception who said that somebody would fix it. Nobody came to fix it. So we mentioned it to reception  on our way to dinner. Again , she replied that somebody would fix it. Alas, nobody came.Finally , when we were checking out of the hotel this morning, we told the receptionist that we enjoyed our stay at this beautiful hotel but that nobody came to repair or replace the coffee machine. There was no explanation  given as to why nobody  came to fix the coffee machine or no apology either .However, even though this happened, we still loved this amazing hotel and hope to return again  ",4,2023,08,08
217,A beautiful hotel which gives a great experience in a wonderful setting just south of Dublin.,"We stayed here to attend a family wedding in Powerscourt House. 
The hotel staff are friendly , welcoming and professional. The bar and restareas have great views and the rooms were very comfortable and immaculate. It was a positive experience from the minute we arrived until we checked out. 
The hotel is in a great setting just south of Dublin and there are many activities. We played the lovely East golf course.
A great place to stay and relax.",5,2023,08,02
217,Elegant hotel with great amenities,"We were upgraded to a suite and it was fantastic.  The decor, spaciousness, bathroom, and cleanliness were all outstanding.  The lobby and grounds were also very appealing and well kept.  We particularly enjoyed the swimming pool, hot tub, sauna, and steam room.  In fact, the steam room is one of the most unique and attractive ones we have ever seen.  Their main restaurant was good, not the best we ate at in Ireland, but certainly decent.  Overall, we were very impressed with our stay and the location next to Powerscourt Gardens is a major bonus.",5,2023,08,01
217,Not up to scratch for 5*,"Stayed recently for our wedding anniversary. Hotel is fab. Room was lovely and we got balloons and sweets on arrival. I feel there are a few things that let it down as a 5* property though. 
- before we arrived we received an email to enhance our stay. We were offered a discounted rate to upgrade to a suite, which we took. On arrival, the receptionist said ‘and you have been upgraded to a suite’. She made it sound like a comp upgrade, but we still had to pay for it. (Maybe for the benefit of other guests checking in???)
- we went to the Spa. Taps on at least 2 of the sinks in the changing rooms were dripping.
- Dinner in Sally Gap was awful. When we complained to the restaurant manager we were just offering feedback. We didn’t want anything but he followed us to the lobby bar and told us the cost of the dinner would be taken off our bill, and also the Prosecco we ordered would be now complimentary. When we checked out, the dinner and Prosecco were still on the bill. We ended up ‘chatting’ to the on duty F&B manager for almost 30 minutes to get it removed. As I said before, we didn’t ask for anything off, but when it was offered, we felt  strongly that we shouldn’t be charged for it. 
- light bulbs flashing in 2 different lights in the lobby bar area. 

We are not fussy people, and have stayed in 5* properties on numerous occasions, but I just feel  Powerscourt are missing a beat on something. 

Staff and room were fab! 

Ultimately, would we return….. No.",3,2023,08,01
217,Outstanding Autograph Hotel - stay here while in Ireland!,"This property definitely deserves a 5+ star rating - a true Autograph Collection facility. As a Marriott Lifetime Titanium member, the suite upgrade on the upper floor was appreciated - beautiful decor and lovely view of the fountain garden and Sugarloaf. Staff were excellent - kudos to Tatu for luggage duties and roundtrip shuttle service into Enniskerry village. Breakfast buffet was crowded but plenty of staff to serve everyone. Regret we didn't have time for the waterfall or gardens tour. Easy drive back to Dublin Airport.  Our only regret - only spent 1 night prior to our flight home. ",5,2023,07,31
217,Wonderful family experience ,"Fabulous 4 day stay with my young family. Hotel staff very accommodating and friendly. Rooms huge and well appointed. Fabulous pool that never seemed busy. Generous family time hours with kid bathrobes provided. Great breakfast options packed full of frest fruit, yoghurts, hot foods with daily specials. Breakfast can be extremely busy; but  run with great proficiency so no delays on service. Staff are professional but also friendly and warm.  

Hotel is in a wonderful location but the kids always asked, '....and when can we go back to the room..'

One thing I was actually grateful for was the small number of kids' tv channels in the room. Some cartoons in the morning only. Kids didn't even miss it. With the wonderful gardens they loved the outdoor playground and huge chess set. 

Overall wonderful experience and highly recommended. 

Recommend room facing out towards gardens and sugar loaf  for wonderful views. ",5,2023,07,30
217,"Incredible Experience, Highly Recommend It!!","I stayed in Powerscourt for 2 nights for my girlfriends birthday and I have to say it was honestly one of the best experiences I’ve ever had!

The entire team at Powerscourt are an absolute credit to themselves they were fantastic from start to finish, the whole reception team were so lovely and willing to help with anything at all, they ensured everything about our stay was perfect and arranged a lovely welcoming plate of chocolates for my girlfriends birthday with a little card from the team it was such a lovely touch!

We had dinner in the Sally Gap which was fantastic the food was delicious and beautifully presented and the staff were great! The next morning I went down for breakfast and was greeted by Emma who was so friendly and another lovely hostess in the Sika restaurant who’s name I didn’t catch arranged a breakfast in bed for my girlfriend with another happy birthday plate a beautiful rose which was such a touch of class and made her so happy! 

We then went to the ESPA spa and had a lovely afternoon tea followed by a massage and facial by Georgia and Megan who are absolutely fantastic at what they do and made us feel so relaxed and comfortable before we got to use the rest of the amazing facilities such as the pool and serenity room! The perfect place for a relaxing break! 

The entire stay was absolutely amazing from start to finish and I really can’t compliment everyone who works there highly enough! I want to say a massive thank you to you all and Powerscourt is without a doubt a 5 star experience! 

The little added touches and the high standards from the entire team just made it such a fantastic experience and I cant recommend it highly enough to anybody!",5,2023,07,29

217,Excellent hotel,"Solo traveller just going for some peace and quiet. Absolutely beautiful experience. I had arranged a massage for the morning I arrived. The staff in the spa were lovely and the massage was amazing. The facilities were spotless. Check in was seemless and I was lucky to get the upgrade that was offered on my package. The room was huge and again spotless. The bathroom was huge. I was overlooking the gardens and the Sugarloaf. Dinner was amazing in both restaurants and there's a little bar area in the lobby which was lovely to sit in after dinner, there was a pianist at one stage and some guys playing guitars. The music was good and unobtrusive. I had only booked for 2 nights but ended up staying 3 as it was so beautiful and relaxing. I wasn't able to keep my original room which was expected as I was on a particular package for  that. The reception staff were extremely helpful in organising the new room for me. The new room was on the otherside of the hotel and overlooked trees and a small walking path. It was a big room and extremely comfortable. Both rooms were very quiet.
The staff, without exception, were amazing and made a solo traveller very welcome. I'm already saving to come back.",5,2023,07,29
217,The BEST Irish Hotel Experience ,"What a fantastic 24 hours we had! To celebrate our 10th wedding anniversary only 20km down the road, this amazing place of serenity offered us everything we needed to rejuvenate & spoil ourselves! Although the amazing setting of Powerscourt offers spectacular tourist attractions in the gardens and waterfall, our soul purpose was to spend some quality couple time together. And we did that in luxury! From lunch on arrival with spectacular views of the Sugar Loaf, to prosecco & choccie strawberries in our stunning suite and then a delicious meal to top off the day, with the largest cheese platter I’ve ever seen (or eaten!). We sat talking in the luxurious bar drinking cocktails and then curled up in the comfiest bed. 24 hours isn’t a lot but it was just enough when you’re being spoiled with 5 star food, service & luxury! This was the best Irish hotel experience we’ve ever had. Thanks to all for our great stay! We’ll be back…",5,2023,07,27

217,Relaxing Anniversary Break.,"We spent a weekend in this Beautiful Hotel as it was our 10 year wedding anniversary. It was so special and something we have vowed to make a tradition of. 
Our Room was absolutely stunning, the most comfortable bed I have ever slept in, with breathtaking views of the Sugarloaf mountain. We made the most of the stunning Pool/ Spa and complimentary bicycles to explore local beauty spots. 
It was hard to pick a favourite aspect of our stay but I found the dining experience of both evening dinner and breakfast unrivalled. 
All Staff are so friendly and helpful. We will most definitely be back for future anniversaries! ",5,2023,07,27
217,Irish luxury at its finest...,We recently stayed at Powerscourt for a Birthday celebration. From the moment we arrived we were made to feel very welcome. We spent time at the Spa and had some treatments - without a doubt the nicest spa area and the staff were amazing. When we went to our room we were delighted to be upgraded to one of the suites. The food in the Sika Restaurant was out of this world and our server Eva couldn't have done more to make us feel comfortable. The next day we borrowed some bikes and explored the area. It was such a pleasant stay and I'm really looking forward to returning some day.,5,2023,07,27
217,A superb hotel in the heart of the wonderful Wicklow countryside,"This hotel is surely the jewel in the crown of the Marriot hotels and epitomises everything you could wish for in an Irish hotel.
Friendly staff, great ambience, a must for those looking for an authentic experience that won’t break the bank.",5,2023,07,27
217,I would return,"Pros - A lovely location, generously sized rooms, extremely comfortable bed, a huge and beautifully decorated bathroom, and a beautiful garden and spa. Both evening meals in the Sally Gap were tasty and the restaurant is beautifully styled, though the menu is a tad expensive and the limited offering might become tiring if you are dining there on multiple nights.

Cons - the receptionist was friendly and polite but it took 15 minutes to check in and I was asked to pay for both rooms for both nights even though I had prepaid.  The bedroom was cold and although I set the temperature to 24 degrees it remained cold throughout our stay as the air con appears to override the heating.  Some of the lighting is operating by a panel by the bed but the lights further away require you to manually turn them off which defeats the purpose of having the technology.  The shower in the bathroom is powerful but if you do not want to get your hair wet you cannot use the fixed ceiling shower and instead must hold the hand held shower because the hook for it is positioned at waist height (I am 5 foot 8 inches) so you cannot leave it afixed to the wall.  On the second day we went for breakfast at 9.30 am and by 9.40 am there was a queue outside the restaurant that was still there when we left at 10.30 am so don’t leave it too late for breakfast.

Overall I enjoyed the stay. I found the hotel relaxing and I felt refreshed at the end of my two night stay.  Any concerns I had were small so I would return.",5,2023,07,25
217,If you want a night of luxury go to Powerscourt 💕,"From the moment we arrived I knew our overnight stay was going to be luxurious,the greetings we got when we came through the door was exceptional, everyone on reception was  been attentive and helpful and greeting all customers with a smile .We were led to the lift and shown where to go.The deal we booked was a possibility of an upgrade when we got there and excitedly we got an upgrade to a suite ,it was amazing we enjoyed every minute of ,our one night stay gave us access to the pool,sauna,steam room ,we wanted to chill out and that's exactly what we done .. everyone everywhere we met was so friendly and accommodating .when we went for our dinner that evening in the Sally Gap restaurant the food was amazing I had chicken supreme and my husband had the steak ,we got a lovely surprise when the very nice lady came down with a happy birthday plate with strawberry and chocolate sweets on it ,it was a lovely added extra touch that told us the communication amongst the staff is spectacular as we were asked at reception were we staying for any occasion.",5,2023,07,21
217,5 Star Stay,Had a brilliant experience with Powerscourt. Stayed for a night and got free upgraded to a suite. Service was amazing throughout our whole stay. Dinner at the Sally Gap was 10/10 and evening drinks in the Sugar Loaf Lounge were delicious. Pool/Sauna facilities were great. We couldn’t fault our stay and wished we could stay longer!,5,2023,07,19
217,"Fairytale Hotel, Service and Amenities","In April, I had the (very brief) pleasure of staying at this wonderful hotel. Upon entry to the grounds, one is immediately transported to a prestigious old-time castle. However, a castle with every single present day luxury and technological item (including heated bathroom floors). Every single part of the hotel, from the staff, to the check-in, to the valet, to the spa, to the room and property details were immaculate! Kudos to the entire staff because everything was amazing. For example, I was trying to purchase a hotel embroidered hat and polo, however, the shop had just closed. The concierge went out of his way to personally open the shop, accompany me as I picked out the presents and did it all with a gracious smile, and wonderful manners. Just one of the many examples the staff exceeded expectations. Additionally, the grounds were kept immaculate by the team, the room service not only beat time expectations but was accommodating in every way. Most hotels, if one looks closely, can find something that is below standard. However, at Powerscourt, every single thing was above standard. I cannot rave enough about the hotel and it was a memorable, and magical, stay. I will be back in the future...for sure!",5,2023,07,17
217,Beautiful Resort,"Powerscourt is a beautiful resort, close to Dublin, but far enough away that you feel like you are in a remote countryside.  The grounds are wonderful.  Our room was amazing, we really enjoyed the touch buttons for the curtains, do not disturb, lights, etc.",5,2023,07,17
217,Exceptional stay,"We purchased the ESPA package for a Friday night and it was worth every penny. The spa was beautifully tranquil and relaxing. Myself and my partner got a massage and facial and they were incredible. The therapists do an excellent job. 
The room was huge! The bed was so comfortable we had an amazing nights sleep. 
We had a stunning view over the treetops. It was all impeccably clean and the facilities were excellent. We asked for extra water to the room that evening and it was delivered in a matter of minutes. We also got breakfast to our room and it was the best decision! 2 full Irish breakfasts arrived piping hot. We’re so glad we experienced the restaurant the day before though because the view was incredible. 
We got a drink in the sugarloaf lounge overlooking the beautiful view. They even had live music in the evening and the following day at lunchtime they had a pianist in the lounge which added to the atmosphere. 
We got dinner in the sika restaurant included in our package and it was perfect. The service was exceptional. 
Overall it was the best stay we’ve ever had and we had the absolute best time. The hotel is beautiful and perfect in every way.",5,2023,07,17
217,An amazing hotel - a real 5 star experience!,"My husband and I have just returned from the most amazing stay at the Powerscourt.  We stayed in one of the mountain view suites and it was absolutely sensational. The room was immaculately clean and very very impressive. The view from our balcony was incredible and even though it was a rainy day, the covered in balcony meant that we could still sit outside. Special thanks to Jessica the reservations manager who honestly could not do enough for us. She was a pleasure to deal with and was extremely helpful. We were celebrating our 2nd anniversary and were greeted with a beautiful dessert plate, chocolates and a card in our room.  The service throughout our stay was second to none, particularly at breakfast.  The range of choice was fantastic , the food was delicious and even making me an iced coffee was not too much trouble.  The managers on duty at breakfast were extremely attentive to all the guests and made everyone feel so welcome. We made the 8 hour room trip from Derry for our night away and cannot wait to visit again! ",5,2023,07,17
217,Superb,"Amazing experience from start to finish. Super friendly and informative staff. We had dinner in the sika restaurant , every detail of the meal was so delicious. Such a comfortable and inviting setting. The breakfast buffet was endless and had so much fresh fruit and bits to choose from. We took bikes out and enjoyed the grounds , would have liked if the gardens were open to hotel guests just as it is an extra cost. However thoroughly enjoyed all powerscourt had to offer and will definitely be back !",5,2023,07,14
217,Great experience,"Had dinner in the main restaraunt, it was sumptuous, my pork belly starter was perfect, followed by beef cooked to perfection and Eva our waitress was efficient and friendly.
💯% - would highly recommend!! The restaraunt looks out onto a beautiful setting.",5,2023,07,13
217,A bit of a let down for what should have been a special occasion,"I went with my boyfriend back in March, he had booked a suite which was really beautiful, he actually proposed to me in our outdoor area, ""I said yes""😊😍 but when he got up off bended knee we realised our outdoor area was covered in broken glass from where a glass had clearly fallen from a height above, our fridge didn't work and when we went to watch the rugby match in the bar we were told that the bar was reserved for people who were having food and that we could watch it in a function room across the way. We were booked into the restaurant that evening so obviously didn't want to eat. I have to say the function room was drab and lacking in atmosphere my fiancé drinks guinness and he said the guinness was awful, I suppose we should have maybe mentioned that we just got engaged but we didn't. Don't get me wrong it's a beautiful hotel with beautiful surroundings, there was just few little things that maybe took the shine of what should have been an amazing night away. ",3,2023,07,12
217,Excellent Hotel.,"We stayed for one night including a round golf for myself and spa treatment for my wife. The course was superb and my wife loved the spa. Room was lovely with a Mountain View. There was a wedding on the day we stayed, but this did not impede on our stay at all, which can be a problem in other hotels, but was not the case here. Restaurant and bar were top notch and staff very nice and helpful.",5,2023,07,11
217,Disappointing engagement weekend ,"Stayed here on paddy's weekend as I decided to propose to my girlfriend.. booked us a suite which was stunning.. I decided to propose on our balcony, which only after doing my proposal,  I realised was covered in broken glass from a bottle from a room above, tried to call reception more than once to get it cleaned but no answer so we told them on checkout. Note we had only been in the suite 10 mins when I proposed.. decided to go to the bar as we were obviously in a celebratory mood, and Ireland and England were playing in the 6 nations, but were told it was only for people eating food, so we were ushered across to a small function room that was showing the game where the strange atmosphere was only bested by even stranger tasting pints so we decided to head back to our room.. the rest of our stay we have no complaints, but for such a big and momentous occasion felt a little disappointed ",3,2023,07,11
217,5 Star in every way,"We had the pleasure of staying in the Powerscourt Hotel last week and believe me this Hotel is on another level. The staff were first class from front desk to catering staff and  in house staff, could not do enough to make our stay something to remember. The architecture of this hotel and the way it was made work with the surrounding landscape is again on another level and no photograph can show what this hotel has to offer. The comfort and design of our room was second to none and again that was carried out through the whole Hotel. We had planned to go out and eat but we had a choice of two restaurants and decided to stay and eat in the hotel which was a very good decision and again the staff could not do enough for you. I can only say that this is one of the best 5 Star hotels, if not the best we have ever stayed in and hopefully will be returning shortly.",5,2023,07,10
217,The most wonderful  hotel we have ever stayed at,"We were so impressed with the Powerscourt Hotel. The room was large and comfortable with a separate dressing area. The bathroom was large and well appointed. The breakfast was one of the best buffet we have ever seen. We booked on the Marriott Bonvoy app and saved nearly 30% versus the rate available at the desk. It was a splurge for us based on our usual stays, but SO worth it. We will definitely stay again.",5,2023,07,09
217,Could have been better," This is a beautiful building in fantastic natural surroundings, however we felt there was something missing during our stay at Powerscourt Hotel.

Checked into our room which was fantastic. Certainly one of  the largest hotel room we have stayed in.  Bathroom and all amenities were fantastic,  plenty of coffee, mini-bar options etc.

After our drive down we were looking forward to a Sunday evening in the Sugarloaf lounge with a nice G+T prior to dinner.  The lounge was not too busy so we ordered our drinks with the waiter, however after a 15 minute wait we had to order our drinks again, no apology or explanation as to the delay, we waited, but after other guests, who had arrived after us were served, we had to re-order again.  Not what I would call 5 star service.  I really got the feeling there was a shortage of experienced staff here.

Booked evening meal in the Sally Gap restaurant.  This restaurant is upstairs, along a corridor beside guest bedrooms, really quite odd.  I would not like to be in the room  opposite the restaurant entrance at busy times.  Menu was fine and the meal was OK but not special.  Staff in the restaurant were very attentive.

I found it quite strange that there was no outside terrace or bar area to have a relaxing drink.  There is a terrace outside the main restaurant but this is not accessible from the main bar.

Breakfast in the Sika restaurant was great with all tastes accounted for.  Coffee was excellent, as was the selection of food.

We enjoyed our stay but generally a strange setup for a 5 star hotel.  It could be so much better with a just little imagination.

 ",2,2023,07,07
217,Wonderful Visit,"Wonderful visit here to celebrate our Wedding Anniversary. The staff were really friendly and helpful, the food was delicious (including our special Anniversary dessert plate!) and our upgraded suite was simply superb. Well done to all.",5,2023,07,05
217,Friends night away ,"Was greeted at the front door, were the doorman took our bags. Reception staff were very friendly, Spa area was so nice and relaxing. Our room was stunning huge and spotless clean. We had booked for afternoon tea which was a let down asked for plain sandwiches but they weren't very plain cakes were nice. Staff were very friendly and helpful. Don't think the afternoon tea was worth the money. Breakfast wasn't great either. Overall love the hotel and cannot fault the staff. Just in my opinion the food was a let down. ",5,2023,07,05
217,Fabulous place for a family holiday ,"This was our first time staying in this gorgeous hotel. There’s no denying that it is a fabulous place, the decor and grounds are simply stunning. You get a feel of a luxury anywhere you look and go.
There’s a pool which was great as our kids love swimming, a playground and bicycles for rent, and plenty of grounds for long walks. Lots of places to visit and explore, like the distillery and Japanese Garden (a must to visit as it’s breathtaking).
The staff is very kind and helpful, always there to assist you.
The only thing I didn’t enjoy was paying €13 for a glass of coke, when you spend so much on accommodation alone, it would be nice not to have to spend almost as much on food and drinks. And I completely understand the 5 star standard, however I believe that type of charges for simple things is just unnecessary.
But that’s just my personal opinion and doesn’t take away from the fact that this place is stunning!
",5,2023,07,05
217,Powerscourt Hotel Resort and Spa has it all and measures up to it’s 5-star rating!,"The most beautiful location from sunrise to sunset.  The accommodations are excellent, very roomy and comfortable.  We had a balcony with a view of SugarLoaf mountain.  Very picturesque.  The breakfast waitstaff and hostess were the best making sure you had everything you needed and wanted.  The breakfast chef is superb.  The food at all the dining experiences were great, however the staff wasn’t as attentive and good as the breakfast team.  There is so much to do on site.  Bicycles free to use, hiking is really special, the fitness center and staff very good.  The House and gardens are beautiful.  The distillery tour is a fun and enjoyable thing to do.  We can’t wait to come back.",5,2023,07,03
217,5 star costs not 5 star service!,"It is a wonderful venue with exceptional bedrooms and décor throughout the hotel.

However unfortunately we found our  stay to have 5 star costs but not 5 star service.

We had difficulty in reserving dinner that evening with options of 5 to 5.15 pm in one of the restaurants and we could only get 9pm in the other restaurant.

Breakfast in the morning was a joke. Having booked breakfast for 10.30 am we had to wait because there were no tables ready.
We had to ask several times for tea and toast, milk , butter and bread. As it was a buffet breakfast there were shortages of the basic food items and at one stage no plates or bowls.

When we were checking out we complained and it was just dismissed.

We are very disappointed with our experience in your hotel.

Regards MW",2,2023,07,02
217,Beautiful location. Not 5 star service. Layout makes no sense.,"The location of the hotel is spectacular on Powerscourt Estate. It had two great golf courses and is very close to the gardens. The hotel itself is a bit dated but definitely  doesn’t meet 5 star service levels. They have a bar and you need to constantly stand and go to the bar to get drinks , staff in general seem disorientated, demotivated and untrained . Coffee machine in room didn’t work and there is no tea. The biggest issue the hotel has is a lack of space for casual drinks/food. It has a huge formal restaurant where you have breakfast too, then a small restaurant located next to bedrooms which is so odd … but considering the size of the place it’s shocking there is no casual space for drinks and food. All 5 star hotels have this. We did not use the spa but it’s a pity the enormous terrace they have can’t be used for more informal drinks/food . The design layout simply makes no sense.",3,2023,07,02
217,Amazing,"One of my favorite places to travel to now! The staff couldn’t have been nicer and so helpful. I know that’s part of their job, but they went above and beyond and genuinely seemed that way whether they were working or not. The hotel is absolutely gorgeous and the shuttle into the adorable town is so convenient and nice! I will definitely be coming here again many times and bringing my family & friends Also, the bed is amazing and one of the most comfortable beds I've ever slept in! I’m so grateful I found this hotel and would highly recommend staying here :)

217,"Stunning hotel, really special","The views from this hotel into the Irish countryside are beautiful, the hotel itself is elegant and feels luxurious. Our room was lovely. The breakfast is amazing, particularly enjoyed the scones, cream and jam and the kippers, but there is lots else.

The garden nearby (separate and slight charge) is worth a visit, in fact worth the journey on its own.

Staff very friendly, really pleasant place.",5,2023,06,27
217,"Excellent staff , accommodation /spa and food","Possibly the best 5 star hotel we have stayed in . The staff are exceptional 
Food delicious and rooms are  very large with superb bathrooms.
The spa was such a lovely addition to our stay and the grounds for walks . 
Myself and my daughter stay regularly for an overnight or 2 beauty escape.  We leave feeling pampered abs very rested .",5,2023,06,27
217,"I've  stayed at some wonderful hotels, but this tops them all.",Everything about this hotel exceeds expectations.  The staff were all very warm and engaging.  Each person conveyed a genuine desire to help and see to each guest's comfort.  The hotel is stunning and is maintained in perfect order.  Everything is very clean and everywhere you look you see attention to detail and beauty.  The grounds are incredible.  The restaurants are fantastic.  The food is delicious and beautifully presented.  I hated to leave!,5,2023,06,24
217,Stunning ,Stunning hotel with beautiful facilities. I particularly loved the fact our room had a walk in closet and I could store away my dresses. The staff were so attentive and helpful. I will definitely be back. ,5,2023,06,20
217,An oasis from the city,"I had the pleasure of spending a number of days at the luxurious Powerscourt estate, in Eniskerry over the Spring months. I could not fault the trip from start to finish. 

The rooms are extremely spacious, comfortable and enjoy great views of the surrounding countryside with access to balconies outside the rooms.

The staff in reception, the resteraunt areas and the spa offered offered a warm welcome and were pleasure to interact with. 

I would highly recommend a stay here, you will not be disappointed.",5,2023,06,15
217,Perfect escape from the City to the Garden of Ireland ,"Took at trip with my sister and mam to Powerscourt last week and had a really wonderful time. The hotel is just gorgeous, and staff were so friendly and helpful. We had dinner in the Sally Gap restaurant which was delicious. Drinks in the bar before and after - beautiful views and a really relaxing atmosphere. We had a triple room - really spacious and comfortable with a fabulous bathroom. We spent the day wandering around Powerscourt House and gardens; some shopping in Avoca, and took in the Waterfall the next day, and on to Avondale to finish off our short trip. We didn't avail of the spa treatments but the spa area looked lovely.  Would really recommend this hotel for an escape from the city, and perfect to be in the beautiful surroundings of the Garden of Ireland. ",5,2023,06,12
217,Dreadful service,Dreadful service. Staff need to be trained to a 5 star standard. Most of the staff were rude and unhelpful. I will not be recommending this hotel to friends or work colleagues. You would get better service in a 3 or 4 star establishment.,1,2023,06,12
217,Magnificent and luxurious,"This hotel is magnificent. Beautiful interiors, rooms that are lush and comfortable, restaurants with delicious and fresh food, friendly service and spotlessly clean. From the moment you drive up, you feel like you have stepped back in time. The rooms are large, bright, beautifully decorated. The bathroom in our suite was enormous with marble floors and countertops, separate shower and bath. The estate grounds are immaculate, with interior and exterior gardens that are well worth exploring. Plan on staying for more than a couple nights to truly enjoy the entire area. Highly recommend!",5,2023,06,09
217,Breakfast awesomeness ,"My children and I went over for a breakfast. 
Celetion in the buffet was amazing and our server Helen was a real 5☆ performer. Every request from the a'lacarte menu was simple ""YES!"". Constant attention and positivity from her really made our morning. Sadly we could see other serves just standing there while tables where full of thirty disses and customer seeking hot beverages and all looked just not right. 
Over all great start of the day.",5,2023,06,09
217,"One word, Superb!","Had a wonderful stay at Powercourt Hotel, Location is stunning, room was superb and staff very attentive but not intrusive.
Food and service in restaurants was excellent, Powercourt House and Gardens only a few mins walk away and Powerscourt Waterfall a 10 min drive.
Plenty of walking/jogging trails for the energetic.
Complimentary bicycle hire also available.
",5,2023,06,09
217,Family Wedding ,We stayed in Powerscourt for a family wedding for 3 days. We had most wonderful time. Rooms staff food atmosphere just about everything was amazing. The grounds and walks are to die for. We both went for a spa treatment on the Sunday morning which left the two off us so relaxed that we didn't want to leave.,5,2023,06,05
217,Already planning my return trip!,"Powerscourt Hotel is a great example of true hospitality. Without a doubt, this is one of my favorite hotels I've stayed to date.
Upon arrival, we were warmly welcomed by the staff and we were upgraded to the Garden View Suite. The staff was friendly, the room was spacious and clean and the mini bar was stocked. The pillows and bed were super comfy - woke up feeling very rested. We dined at the Sally Gap restaurant where I had the Chicken Supreme, which I'm still dreaming about. It was a handy location to explore the gardens and waterfalls. Looking forward to coming back!",5,2023,06,02
217,Could be better,"The suite was fabulous, with impressive decor and technology. The service was very disappointing however, and detracted from the beautiful surrounds. On the week leading up to our stay it took several days to get in contact with reservations to make an amendment to our booking, the phone lines were always unattended or diverted to a switch board. The check in time is a bit late, 4pm, and then there were ques and the process was slow. We were informed at check in there was no need to make a reservation for the restaurant, however when we got to the restaurant requesting a table for 2, there was no availability. Next we approached reception to order a taxi, to try get dinner in the nearby village. The attendant at the desk advised us to use a taxi app instead, I tried this but no driver seemed available, we went to ask again if there was a local taxi they could call, then they informed us there was actually a courtesy shuttle bus going to and from the nearest town. The only bar available was near the lobby/foyer, it was small and it lacked atmosphere, the view however was quite spectacular. The drinks menu was far behind others I have experienced and the choice was limited. The main toilets , and the only ones that could be seen, was a WC, for which there was a que, so I found it easier to go back to the room as it wasn’t far. The following day we were refused a later check out which seemed a bit unreasonable, another hour would have helped, but I understand they need to get ready for the next guests. A beautiful estate with lots of outdoor gardens and space to explore, unfortunately the staff and customer service at Powerscourt let us down.",3,2023,06,01
217,Absolute Perfection,"My family and I have been lucky to stay at some amazing hotels, but Powerscourt is by far the best experience we have ever had. The grounds are breathtaking, the food and service were exceptional. We ordered room service, as well as eating on site, and each time the food was delicious and plentiful. Our rooms were spotless and tastefully decorated as well as being very comfortable. I dropped an earring into the sink, and within an hour of me calling for help, they had the earring out of the pipes. Everyone we encountered was committed to providing the best service possible. It was very hard to leave, and I can't wait to go back.",5,2023,06,01
217,Family Vacation to Ireland,"Amazing hotel.  We took our family of five to Ireland and am thrilled we started our 14 day tour if Ireland in lovely Wicklow County at none other than the Powerscourt Marriott property. Amazing amenities. We used the spa, the indoor pool with dry and wet saunas, the workout facility, arranged for falconry on the grounds of the hotel, played golf, ate at the restaurants multiple times (food was the best we had in all of Ireland), walked the gardens of a Powerscourt, went to the waterfall and played golf.  This will be our destination when we return to Ireland in the future. Thank you to the staff for making our trip so amazing. ",5,2023,05,29
217,Picture Perfect Place,"Wonderful stay at this beautiful property! The hotel and grounds are spectacular. It’s and easy walk to the gardens and into the town of Enniskerry. We had a large group of family and friends all staying at the hotel for my daughter’s wedding that took place nearby. It was a good time had by all! I want to give a special shout out to the staff, especially Mossy! He went above and beyond coming to save the day and helping us change our flat tire on the road leading into the hotel! Thank you again Mossy!",5,2023,05,29
217,Phenomenally Comfortable,One of the most comfortable beds we have ever slept on. We stayed at a few other five stars in Ireland and this was our favorite by far. Beautifully appointed rooms that enclose a lovely green garden and active fountain with the  regions hills in the background.  Have lunch on their terrace and take the bikes for a spin…be prepared you will likely be walking back up a very big hill if you go down past the Powerscourt mansion. ,5,2023,05,28
217,A class act from start to finish!,"We were pampered from the minute we entered! Arrived early!  Not a problem. The upgraded room for both our stays! The many activities, the food.. no stone left unturned. Every single staff member from the moment we arrived were absolutely unbelievable. We hope to be back time and time again to experience everything we did not get to fit in. Powerscourt Hotel autograph collection you have outdone yourselves. Thank you for a magnificent time! We cannot wait to return!",5,2023,05,26
217,Recommend this hotel for any occasions,"We had a brilliant experience,  staff was so lovely and provided worls class service, they made us feel so welcome! Kids were really happy, we are definitely coming back again. Thank you Powerscourt Hotel team.",5,2023,05,24
217,Heaven ,Amazing!   Dream experience cannot wait to return.  Our room was fabulous. Only bad thing is that my room was not ready at 4pm - which is not good enough given the price of one night stay.  Loved the spa.  ,5,2023,05,24
217,Calm and relaxing,"We stayed for 2 nights at the Powerscourt Hotel.  We were impressed as soon as we drove up the drive, it was very grand!  We were even more impressed walking into the main foyer.  We were early but were able to check in and get our room. It was huge and had a mountain view.
The ambience of the hotel was very relaxing and peaceful.
The staff were attentive and we had a drink in the sugar loaf lounge, with a guy playing the piano.
We didn't go to either of the restaurants for dinner as the menu wasn't to our personal preference.  We had a buffet breakfast on the terrace in the mornings, the sun was shining and the view was lovely.
Overall a great experience!!",5,2023,05,23
217,A fabulous place,"We went for a birthday celebration, my mum , my daughters and myself. We enjoyed the afternoon in the pool , sauna and spa facilities. The rooms were a delight and I wish I'd more time in them just to laze around. The staff were friendly and very helpful, the breakfast was delicious and held on the balcony overlooking the gardens, cannot recommend it highly enough.",5,2023,05,20
217,Avoid if you like good food!,"Awful food and service, went for first two nights of our honeymoon, massive mistake. Paid for room up grade, bathroom not clean, 3 facilities in spa not working. I was paying over £1000 a night and got food poisoning. Meal in sally gap was worst I've ever had, then got over charged for drinks that never arrived. Complained but still on bill, food was utterly dreadful, only to be matched by appalling breakfast buffet, sure this is what made me ill. Voiced my concerns when checking out, nobody cared. I'd avoid this hotel at all costs.",1,2023,05,18
217,Disappointing,"Beautiful setting but falls short of 5* quality and service. The hotel is reasonably maintained, but from check in to restaurant service is nowhere even approaching five star. The staff are undertrained. The restaurant is a set menu (if you’re lucky enough to get a menu) which is a far cry from any high end hotel or restaurant. The room although cleaned was lacking clean glasses or coffee , both addressed with the staff but went uncorrected. The prices are five star but the experience is not, save the money and stay elsewhere. ",2,2023,05,17
217,The view from the 6th floor even numbers!,"This is more than just a hotel, it’s a retreat. The grounds are beautiful. The waterfall is the highest in Ireland. The staff is beyond friendly. The views though, the view from the sixth floor is amazing. The 6th floor even numbers have a patio. It’s is worth every penny.",5,2023,05,17
217,Excellent service,"I look forward to returning already. Our stay was excellent. Having confided in a slight neurosis during check-in (my problem, not the hotel's I should add), my room was immediately changed to avoid any discomfort. I was deeply grateful, especially as the hotel was at maximum capacity and changing my room would not have been easy. (Thank you Jean at reception!) 

The staff are helpful, joyful and kind. The rooms are spotless and sun-filled overlooking the mountain. Despite being fully booked, we swam alone in the pool and only met one other guest in the steam room. The nature walks are bewitching and filled with wild garlic during spring. I wouldn't hesitate to recommend a stay at Powerscourt. We are going to make it an annual ritual! 
",5,2023,05,14
217,Horrible,"This hotel was lovely but the room was horrible and smelt really bad plus when I opened my bag when I returned I could still smell it. 🤮 the service when we arrived also wasn't good we arrived late and our room wasn't ready 🤔 they said they would ring us when ready 2hrs later and we went to them asking is it ready. 
",3,2023,05,13
217,A wonderfully luxurious stay,"I had a wonderful stay here. The kind lady on reception when we checked in was lovely and upgraded my room to a larger one with a mountain view and balcony, which turned out to be one of the best rooms I have ever stayed in. It was absolutely huge and with the most comfortable bed with lovely bed linen and soft pillows.  Everything was super luxurious including the marble bathroom.  I love the glamorous spa and sauna and we also had a delicious meal in the hotel's Sika restuarant.  I thoroughly recommend this hotel.   ",5,2023,05,12
217,"WOW, exceptional stay","Powerscourt was exceptional! We received a warm and friendly welcome from the door lady and reception on arrival. The lobby and lounge bar is so granduer with amazing views of the mountains. Now for the room, when we walked through the door we were blown away by the size (it was huge). We booked a classic room and it had an enormous walk in wardrobe and bathroom with a tub and separate shower. The bedroom area was so spacious and to top it off we had a balcony which overlooked the gardens and mountains.

We dined at Sally Gap and opted for the 2 course menu. The food was lovely and the service quick.

Breakfast was served in the downstairs restaurant and the  buffet selection was great.

Unfortunately we only stayed for 1 night.

We would highly recommend this hotel.",5,2023,05,09
217,Great Employee,"I would like to give a shout out to Elvis who works in the Leisure Centre at Powerscourt Hotel. He works very hard and does an amazing job. When he is on breakfast duty everything is always spotlessly clean and well stocked ; the food, the crockery, the fridges and coffee machines etc.
He is an absolute gentleman, polite, courteous, cheerful and obliging.
He is a great asset to the hotel. ",5,2023,05,01
217,Check in mix up ,"In a major check in mix up, I was told they could not find my reservation which was booked under a friend's name. I was directed to 'Powerscourt Springs' which I had difficulty finding but when I did discovered it was in fact a health farm!! I spent ages driving around trying to find another hotel but could not find any. Eventually gave up and waited in Enniskerry village until my friends made contact (they had been in the spa and were out of coverage). Confirmed it was actually the correct hotel. Explained situation at reception and this time, they found the reservation straight away. They apologised and took my details assuring me they would look into the situation and get back to me. It never happened, no call, no nothing. This I find to be extremely poor service from an hotel that prides itself on 5 star quality and service. Unfortunately a lot of the staff seemed to be interns and their level and comprehension of english was poor. From my observations, they were not happy staff, they appeared stressed and uninterested. This incident really took away from my stay as I wasted hours looking for another hotel that didn't exist. Yes,, the hotel is nice, in need of a refurb though. It looks impressive from the outside though. Rooms are comfortable, evening food was really good but breakfast was disappointing. My major gripe is the service, it was deplorable. I did feel sorry for staff especially at reception who seemed totally out of their depth. I'm not asking for much but even if staff smiled and asked how are stay is going! When checking out, I was not asked how my stay was which is standard in most hotels. It took away from what was to be a joyous big Birthday celebration and my friends fekt the same. Needless to say, I won't be returning. ",3,2023,04,30
217,Simply perfect!,"From start to finish, I can’t thank Powerscourt staff enough for their hospitality and help! We stayed in Powerscourt after our wedding as a mini-moon. 

When we arrived to reception we were immediately upgraded to a suite - a lovely surprise and the most beautiful room! They even left us chocolates and a welcome treat. The receptionist was very helpful going through times for meals and breakfast also.

We used the spa a few times during our stay- always relaxing as we stayed during adult only hours and plenty of seats. Great pool and lovely jacuzzi. We couldn’t get a massage etc booked as fully booked up but it was Easter holidays so we will have to come back to try that!

Breakfast and dinner was also some of the best I have ever sampled. Huge variety and excellent portion sizes. 

We went to the gardens on one of the days and walked around the hotel itself, stunning location and a great mix of activities to do.

Would recommend to anyone looking for some luxury or a few days away - you feel like you are in the south of France when driving through the gates! 

Will definitely be back - maybe even for an anniversary. Superb.",5,2023,04,29
217,Disappointing Experience,"Myself and my wife chose Powerscourt for a 3 night getaway in celebration of our first year wedding anniversary. The beautiful hotel had a reputation of being top class. This is far from what we experienced. 
Things started off wrong, with our booking being cancelled at 11am the day of check in, with no explanation. We rang the hotel and it was rebooked but it raised concerns. We have still had no explanations
Upon arriving in the hotel we unpacked where we discovered underwear of the previous guests which seemed to have been missed by cleaning.
The toilet flush broke and we had to call for it to be fixed, which it was immediately.

At check in, we asked about booking dining options and were informed that the bar was closed. This left 2 options for dinner, both of which consist of set menus with a min of 2 courses. We ordered a lemon tart which consisted of mainly raspberry jam with no taste of lemon. 
We waited 30 min to be acknowledged after seating in the Sika restaurant. It was 40 min before we could order food. When the mains came, we had to send back a side of potatoes as they were stone cold.
Due to the poor service and mediocre food both nights we chose to order room service for our last night. We had 2 burgers and skinny fries  in our room which was by far the best meal we had in Powerscourt. 

Chromecasts which are advertised and mentioned at check in didn’t work. We had to call for someone to have a look at it and they said to use the pay for entertainment option and it wouldn’t be charged. It was fine considering we weren’t paying but it wasn’t worth the 12 euro fee
We were asked when booking what the booking was in celebration of if anything. Not once was the anniversary acknowledged. We don’t expect anything, but if you are asking the question as a 5 star hotel, acknowledge it. 
These are all small inconveniences that on their own can be brushed off, but when you experience them all over the course of 72 hours in what is meant to be a 5 star hotel, it’s a bit much. 

As noted on the card in the room and as is best practice, we tried to notify our concerns and disappointments with the manager. We went to the front desk where we were told to come back after breakfast. We came back half an hour later and were then told there was nobody available to talk to us. We were told we would receive a call/ voice message to the room. No call was ever received and no message left. We were ignored.
Upon checking out when asked if we were happy, we said disappointed and flagged the above. We did receive a 15% room rate discount for the inconveniences but the reality is it’s not about the money. We booked knowing the cost, the bill isn’t the issue.
The expectations in services though were not met. If you expect guests to pay 12 euro for a pot of tea between two, you best be holding up your end of the deal.

Wouldn't recommend. It was a disappointing experience for our first wedding anniversary and we can't get that back

217,Amazing Stay such a treat,"This was a treat to a friend for both us to stay overnight as was over from UK . 
We had an amazing cream tea and breakfast was excellent .

217,"Skip the arrogant management staff, go to Glenview","This was the last stop of an otherwise fabulous trip.  If you are not a wealthy older man, go elsewhere.  We upgraded our room from a mountain view.  We were put into a room overlooking the parking lot.  When we asked the snippy manager Jenny, she told us we didn't read the description well enough.  I asked to downgrade our room to something less ugly, and she reluctantly gave us the furthest room in the hotel and said it was the only room left, when the hotel clearly was not even 1/4 full.  So we brushed it off and went to their nicer restaurant for a good meal.  There were literally 4 tables occupied but as 2 women, we couldn't get a waiter to come over.  After 2 hours we went to ask for our check, and again another snooty manager acted put out at our refusal to accept terrible service for inflated priced.  The bellman and front desk staff were of course delightful, and the falconry we signed up for was spectacular.  But next time we would go to Glenview as is suggested on every travel site for good reason.  This was awful.",1,2023,04,24
217,Love this hotel - just a little less," found the staff  very accommodating to our then baby and they went over and above to assist any way possible however this time upon check in we heard the lady staff member who was checking people in apologise to others for the number of kids (which wasn’t that many in fairness ) running around / creating noise and it’s not normally like it, it’s because it’s term time. 
Immediately we felt a degree of uneasiness as travelling with a toddler & trying to tell a 18month year toddler to be quiet and sit still in the foyer in order to not disrupt the quiet atmosphere was not going to an easy task - again if mc gills was open this would not have been an issue as it’s relaxed / nosier . 
This was off putting as she also advised sika restaurant which we were already aware off has set times for kids which I fully appreciate but again a comment was made “kids aren’t suitable at all really “ and a better idea would be to book Sallys Gap.  

Upon her advice one of the nights we dined here and we were hugely disappointed in the food quality (average ) extremely limited food & drinks menu , staff seemed young and experienced and the vibe just wasn’t there - it felt like a make shift restaurant with an ice cream cart in the corner . 

The house keeping also seemed to be under pressure ( perhaps a staff shortage ) the food trolleys remained in the hall for the most of the day and our daily clean wasn’t completed to 530pm. The bed however was extremely comfortable and I found this always to be the case whilst I stay her.😁we did ask for cot in the room and whilst this was usually provided in advance we had to phone the front desk a few times to sort. 

While we really do love this hotel, the location/ facility is amazing and 5 star but the service & food wasn’t as enjoyable as previous and some improvements I hope are made. I would like to return again as the Powerscourt  has really provided us with some amazing memories on previous visits & I really hope this was a one off less enjoyable experience.

217,Stylish stay,"From the moment we arrived, the wonderful ambience that is Powerscourt enveloped up. Our Mountain View room did not disappoint and our afternoon tea looking at the amazing view was so worth the money. It was a birthday treat for my daughter and the birthday plate was a lovely extra touch. 
We wandered the grounds which are beautifully kept and finally paid a visit to the nearby Powerscourt waterfall. 
All in all, a lovely treat for both of us.",5,2023,04,17
217,Powerscourt Hotel – Never fails to impress,"We stayed on April 10th & 11th. This is our 5th time staying here in the last 12 months. The location, hotel grounds, staff, and overall service make this one of Ireland's best 5-star hotels.
First time eating in the Sally Gap restaurant - The food was excellent, and the staff were so polite. Having the ice cream cart in the restaurant was a really nice touch for kids.
I can’t wait to return and enjoy everything this hotel has to offer.

217,Timeless relaxation,"A lovely hotel that takes you back in time when things seemed to be much more refined and classic. Upgraded to a suite that was exceptional, with it's lovely bedroom, living room, 1 -1/2 baths, heated floors, and an immense balcony for starters, we were very pleasantly surprised. The facilities, service and grounds are also truly unique and provide a bit of Ireland that is difficult to find elsewhere. A stay of several nights is certainly recommended to really relax and experience all that is available.",5,2023,04,13
217,Absolutely gorgeous hotel and grounds!!,"We absolutely loved this hotel!  It's 5 star magic.  Such beautiful grounds on a huge old estate, gorgeous little village nearby etc.  The restaurant and lounge were amazing.  We also ate at the Italian restaurant in Enniskerry, which was excellent.  The decor and furnishings are amazing.  The rooms are huge with a sitting room and bedroom.  We got two rooms for my family and had tons of space.  The pool and hot tub, sauna and steam room were great.  They need to turn up the heat on the hot tub - my only complaint.  The area around the hotel is beautiful.  Would definitely stay there again!",5,2023,04,13
217,Anniversary Stay,"Stayed April 10th for just the one night for a wedding anniversary- wish it was a longer stay. From check in to check out a great stay. Breakfast selection is great. Eggs Benedict cooked to perfection. Staff checking all is good and preparing some fruit for my daughter was much appreciated. The suite was luxurious. My almost 2 yr old has declared this her favourite hotel so we’ll be back. Swimming pool and grounds magnificent and spotless. Dined in the sally gap lounge which had great service if a slightly limited selection but great tasting and presented food. Some of the friendly staff from McGills redeployed temporarily.

Nothing is too much trouble for Eamonn and his staff and I really appreciated the touches they made to enhance my stay. 

9th visit soon hopefully.

217,Family birthday weekend,"We love this hotel, in fact this hotel and Ashford castle are our favourite hotels in Ireland . We have stayed here many times, my daughter & I love the spa with lunch as our birthday treat. This year we included my husband and son for the spa. 
While we really do love this hotel, the location, facilities, our recent trip wasn’t as enjoyable as previous ones. 
When we check in we usually park the car for the weekend, enjoy the location, the walks and cycling, along with food and wine. 
We always have casual dinner on the Friday night, and fine dining on Saturday night. The waitress seemed very inexperienced, and made quite a mess pouring our wine. I enjoyed my starter, however when my steak arrived I noticed a black hair on it (I have long blonde hair) as soon as the waiter/manager placed my plate down, I saw the hair and asked for my steak to be replaced, his response was “oh yes I see that, let me change that for you” no apology.  When I was giving a new steak, he said the chef sends his apologies. As this was mine and my daughter’s birthday weekend, my husband was very annoyed with the response and lack of apology, my husband spoke to the waiter/manager (I believe this guy was the manager, certainly more senior than the waiter) said this shouldn’t happen in any restaurant not to mention a 5 star hotel. We ate our dinner, and the guy came and said they would remove my main course from the bill, he the proceeded to make a point of emphasising that this was a good will gesture. This left a really bad taste in my mouth! We hadn’t asked for anything to be removed form the bill, but certainly feel this is the least they could have done. Hristian was another member of staff, he was so nice to us, he said he was aware there was an issue with our food and asked what had happened, when my husband told him, he was very apologetic, said he would get a glass of champagne for my daughter and I for our birthdays. Hristian was the only one in the restaurant who made us feel welcome, was polite and courteous. Overall, what was an unfortunate error with the hair on my steak, turned into a dreadful evenings experience because of the way that staff member treated us. We still love this hotel, but will probably reconsider any future return plans.",4,2023,04,11
217,Fool me once shame on you ...5 stars hardly,"How the resort maintains 5 star rating is and will be the single most amazing feat in Food service history . Checked in on a Friday Afternoon to a lovely suite on  the first floor with view of the walk way I reserved a mountain view . No pillows , coffee  cups, 2 TVs that were both flashing no signal for the next 15 hours . The pub is closed for some reason , I was told it was to popular what ever that means . No place to enjoy a beer or some traditional Irish food .It was master weekend so and no pace to watch it . One manager was able to put a tv in the tea room that I could watch from 30 feet away with no sound . That changed quickly as they change it to soccer 15 minutes in .
The only food available was a three or four or course price fix meal in the two remaining restaurants .  Long day behind I opted for room service .  I ordered at 8pm "" the New Yorker "" a pastrami sandwich on rye with pickle swiss chees and Dijon mustered .  What I got 2 hours later was one or maybe 2 ozs of cold pastrami on focaccia bread no cheese on mustered and a shredded pickle with stone cold fries . This only happened after two call to the front desk . It was an insult to anyone who has ever worked in a restaurant . 

The next day with the food trolley still in the middle of the sweet we ventured out . The grounds , spa, gardens are worlds class  it was an  amazing day . We retuned after 5 to find the same food trolley in a dirty room . I called the front desk an they sent in some cleaners they did the bare minum while we waited . the was no vacuumed no replacing glasses or coffee cups. TV was working. Beds are terrific a restful night . 
up in the morning no coffee beyond the in  room stuff . great day at the garden and distillery returned again after five to another un made room and a call to the front desk . I was told the manager was alerted an d would contact me .. once again nothing.
The last day we had breakfast the was very good . I was told the manager was looking to speak to me .i never heard from him . We never ate in the two restaurants but I figured if they cant male a pastrami sandwich  I wasn't missing much .

THe facility is 5 stars the service and food need a lot of work .

 I have another trip planned for Ballyknocken  I might come back too somewhat a year can do

217,Fabulous hotel and spa set in the stunning Powercourt estate and Wicklow hills,"This hotel is one of the finest and possibly the finest 5 star resorts that i have ever stayed in.Nestled into the Powesrcourt Estate in the stunning Wicklow hills it has a spectacular setting and the hotel has had no expense spared.It is absolutely stunning in every sense from the moment you drive in, to the stunning lobby and rooms that are fit for a king.They kindly gave us a free upgrade to a junior suite which was fabulous and beyond spacious.The bed and the sheets were like nothing else - promoting a sound nights sleep.The breakfast was 5 star all the way.We stayed for 3 nights and availed of the spa which was excellent.The staff at this hotel are all singing from the same hymn sheet - they all excel at their job and clearly enjoy what they do.I cannot recommend Powercourt resort enough and will gladly return - if you enjoy a luxury retreat in sumptuous splendour with lovely walks in splendid scenery then this is the place for you.
Cant recommend enough.Keep up the good work at Powerscourt resort folks.",5,2023,03,29
217,Powerful Powerscourt!,"I was really excited for our stay at the Powerscourt. I booked it knowing the location was rather isolated and far from: the airport, Dublin city center, and even Bray.
However, once you arrive, you understand why one might choose to stay here rather than urbania. The Powerscourt is situated in the beautiful Irish countryside, with universal views of the Sugar Loaf Mountains. On our first day, we toured the adjacent Powerscourt Gardens, which was the highlight of the trip. It was raining, but we powered through, and we are so relieved that we did. Absolutely beautiful!

Upon check-in at the hotel, we were greeted by lovely door service and bell-hops. Reception was a bit of a different story. The employee was not overly welcoming, which was a bummer because we were so excited to be there. She did help us make our breakfast reservation for the next morning, but she did not tell us how to arrange this for the following days. Upon check-in, they put a hold on your CC, but this is not the final charge.

We were very pleased with the room. The bathrooms are stunning, and the beds super comfortable. The lighting system is a bit confusing (other reviews mention this as well), also I think there's a TV in the bathroom (in the mirror) but ours did not work? They advertise Chromecast in each room, but you have to have someone from guest services come to your room and set it up. Not great. The water pressure in the shower is fantastic, and I love having 2 sinks.

We only had breakfast once at the hotel because, like I said, it was arranged for us on the first day, but we were not advised how to do this ourselves for the remaining days. We could have asked, but after our initial experience with reception, we felt when we approached them we were bothering them. The breakfast is in the Sugar Loaf Lounge (nice restaurant overlooking the mountains), and the buffet spread is impressive. They have plenty of delicious options for everyone. However, upon being greeted by the hostess, we were told a server would come around to take coffee/tea/omelet orders. We were never approached by a server, though there were many in the restaurant attending to all of the tables around us. We felt intentionally ignored. 

We had some taxi drivers during our stay that shared how the true locals really feel about this hotel and the staff. It does not have the best reputation. Apparently, there is a history of the hotel purposely overcharging guests (they are hurting--not enough guests especially during the winter/spring offseason). We were also told that most of the staff lives at the hotel (this is a way the Marriott lures them to work there). Overall, we had a nice stay, but the fact that several different cab drivers shared the same reservations about this place is a bit concerning. I felt a little uneasy staying there knowing these opinions.

Anyways, I really cannot emphasize the beauty of the Powerscourt. Just being able to take in the views and explore the Powerscourt Gardens was worth it. We did not utilize the spa/resort/pool, or eat at the hotel restaurants. We would have loved to check out the pub (McGill's), but our schedule was too packed and we had reservations elsewhere. We also were unable to see the Powerscourt Waterfall. It is farther from the hotel than the Gardens/Estate, and it is advised to go by car (about 5km, unpaved walking path). Because this place is so isolated, it can be difficult to get a last-minute ride. We used Free Now (like Uber). The hotel will also arrange a cab in advance.

If you are looking for a serene retreat, this is your place. Just make sure you devote time to seeing the Powerscourt Gardens, too.

217,"From Loyal Fan to Couldn’t Wait to Leave: favorite stay of the past not family friendly, double changed us, lied","I have never been so disappointed with a place that I once loved so much. It was so sad to think back on how excited I was to get back to one of my favorite stays that I’ve been to many times, and how happy I was to leave it. I have recommended Powerscourt to so many people and have since told them all to stay clear as it’s gone downhill. I have a friend coming to ireland in a few months with her extended family and I had recommended Powerscourt to her before our visit based on my previous wonderful stays and since our stay in early February, I recommended they no longer make this a hotel on their list as it must’ve gone down post pandemic and their plans have changed due to the poor management and guest service specifically at reception. There were many kind people, such as the vallet, housekeeping, and those serving at breakfast. But I wonder how long that could last when the front desk and manager were clearly looking to make money off of guests even if that meant double charging them!

We had not one, but three instances in our three nights where they were doing this! We were staying in ireland on a luxurious trip, so we weren’t on a budget trip, but that doesn’t mean I won’t mind being double charged, or charged for what I was told would be complimentary or what I was told would have no fees and have never been charged for before. 

For one thing, our final Bill at hotel checkout we were charged for the fruit basket we had already paid in advance for to be placed in my in-laws room. Now , I understand accidents happen, but when I questioned the unexpected charge on the bill, she said it hadn’t been paid and treated me like I was trying to get something for free. But when I showed her the email receipt  from Powerscourt confirming payment receive from them two weeks before we traveled, she looked back at her computer and said, “oh, I can see it here too. It has been paid.” She said I’d see a refund in the future and didn’t apologize for double charging us or for telling me I was wrong and needed to pay it when it said paid on her computer screen. There were also unexplained gratuity fees and service fees on the checkout bill that I never received in previous stays and even though I asked her what they were for she just said they were gratuity and service fees, which wasn’t an explanation, and this was after I’d already found one double charge on the bill and she had refunded that one. So I honestly still have no idea what they were there for, but I was already annoyed and knew the front desk wasn’t helpful and was just after money so I just wanted to leave at this point due to the other issues of them trying to nickel and dime us mentioned below. 

So, this is what really made me mad and honestly has made me decide not just to not come back to what was one of my favorite resorts, but encourage others with families not to do so too! I call Powerscourt to request adjoining rooms for us and our children one month in advance. They tell me to call back within a few days of our stay to ensure there is availability. I call back one week prior to our stay and the friendly person says that if I want to guarantee connected rooms in advance, it’ll be €200 extra per each night, but if I arrive and they have availability, they normally give families traveling with young children interconnecting rooms. Our last stay, of the several we have had with Powerscourt, they upgraded us for free and we didn’t even request it, so going off our previous wonderful guest experience and the fact we were coming for several days during off season and getting three rooms, we chose to wait.  We arrived and they had many vacancies, but they would not allow us to have interconnecting rooms without paying the ridiculous price increase. I spoke with the manager and explained that we had been told that if there was availability it was communicated to us that it is common to give a family with young children an interconnecting suite. The manager first told me that they had availability for the room, but couldn’t upgrade us because of the hotels large occupancy… then moments later when I asked if a room could be ready ahead of check in, and she said we could have one immediately because they were low on occupancy! Which was exactly the opposite of what she had just said regarding the room! My family has been to 4 countries and 13 states in the US  in the last year and stayed at many lovely places, we’ve never once been charged to have interconnecting rooms in any of our travels in order to have us and our very young children close together. We stayed at Adare manor right after Powerscourt and they were so accommodating and when I mentioned interconnecting rooms to them, they said “of course you’ll want to be right by your littles.” And not only didn’t charge us, just like every one of the over 20 places we’ve stayed in, but Adare’s thoughtful staff even gifted stuffed animals in the room for the children!” 

If Powerscourt had told me that they are the only resort I’ve ever been to that has no option for families but to pay extra to be interconnected in advance, I would think it wasn’t a very accommodating place for families, but would have happily paid the extra amount to feel that I had better access to my children than every other person who can get into their room (room service, hotel staff, etc.) (I always leave the door between rooms open so that it becomes a connected home for us.) It’s truly a major safety concern to have young children separated from their parents and with international kidnappings, it’s just something I wouldn’t bat my eye at paying for safety-wise, but connecting family rooms should be a safety concern for any thoughtful business in the hospitality industry in this day and age. So, I wouldn’t be leaving this truly upset review, had it been explained as a necessary expense (albeit a hospitality failure instead safety and guest concern area.) But I was specifically told it I would need to pay for a guarantee of interconnecting rooms, but not for a room if I show up and it’s available through my stay. I knew in advance it was off season and that many interconnected rooms were available. 

So after shelling out €600 euros (on top of the three rooms I had already paid for for multiple nights and the fruit basket I would later be double charged for) for the luxury of experiencing what should be common practice of placing parents by their children. I then asked if breakfast was included in our rooms. The hotel  front desk staff said, normally the breakfast is after you’ve spent a night in the hotel, but you’ve had a long day, help yourself, it’s “on us.” I felt that the front desk worker had felt badly that the manager had not followed through on what we were told, so I thought it was a kind gesture. So the six of us go down to breakfast and at breakfast they say we have to pay to eat and we told them the front desk said it was on them, and the breakfast crew said we’d need to pay and bring the receipt to the front desk and they’d handle refunding us. We paid €84 for breakfast and enjoyed the wonderful breakfast they had. Later, when we went to the front desk, the receptionist said we must’ve misunderstood, but that she had meant that the breakfast was for us to enjoy. 
My friend and I now joke about how such and such is “on us” or “on me” and then tease that we had no intention of paying for it, but I meant for you to enjoy it on me, but pay for it yourself. Seriously, the services at this hotel has become a joke for us because how was I and the 3 other adults who heard this supposed to interpret them saying “on us?”
The breakfast was great, and I did pay for everyone’s meal and I would’ve paid for it had they not said it was “on us.” But it’s truly the principal of this whole situation. We were on a luxury trip, we came expecting to pay money. I have been looking forward to this trip for 4 years and replanning it for 3 years since it was canceled! We spent two beautiful weeks in ireland and our only negative experience was consistently this place. Even my in-laws said they had a fabulous dinner there, but that the food took over an hour to come to their table AFTER they had put their order in. Other guests were complaining about how long their food was taking and how a five star hotel shouldn’t take this long to serve a dinner. And I didn’t mind paying for things, I just thought the number of times I felt lied to, deceived, and truly robbed by them double charging and then having absolutely no apology was embarrassing and bad enough for me to say please skip this hotel. I once loved it, but I will never return. They even have a card in the room requesting if anything is not right, to tell them in person and not do it online. But I spoke with the manager, and she did nothing to make good on her word and I’m clearly it was just one of many of the same unprofessional gestures. And with the money I have to spend, it won’t be with people who will lie or try to take advantage of me. So unprofessional and distasteful. They turned a loyal raving fan into someone who couldn’t wait to drive away and tell others to do the same in only three nights.",1,2023,02,26
217,Exceptional Stay at Powerscourt,"Our stay in Powerscourt was exceptional. It was a treat just before the arrival
of our 3rd child.  From the moment we checked in to after we checked out we received high class service. 
We were upgraded to a room with a balcony overlooking the sugar loaf and woke up to a crisp frosty morning with a beautiful view.

We had dinner in Sika, again the service was so attentive and pleasant. The food was made to perfection. We really enjoyed every bite and the atmosphere. 

Afterwards in the bar the great service continued from entry to ordering drinks.  I didn’t order anything to drink from feeling full of dinner and baby but still -  a glass of water with orange and lemon slices was placed in front of me by the bar man while my husband enjoyed some very nice Guinness.

We enjoyed the pool in the evening and in the morning. It’s such a relaxing space to be. 

The grounds and surrounding gardens/Enniskery village are all beautiful places to walk and take in.

Looking forward to our next stay already 🙏

Thank you 🙏

217,My stay in Powerscourt,"We stayed in Powerscourt Autograph Hotel on 10th Feb for one night. It exceeded our expectations. 
The staff are very friendly while being wholly professional. The amenities are amazing, from arrival to our departure we achieved everything we needed to in order to de stress, 
The spa is so relaxing it catered for our every need.

The food was fab we had a lovely meal in McGills bar service was second to none , with live music to entertain us. We had a night cap in the lounge where we met lovely people, a nice end to our chilaxed evening.

  We left the hotel with a definite intention to return. It was fantastic .

217,A rosey sunrise,"My wife and I stayed for 2 nights from the 7th to the 9th of February and really enjoyed our visit - infact we booked to return at the end of March before we left.
We were warmly greeted and given a room upgrade to a suite which a lovely surprise - what a view over the estate! We managed to photograph a rosey sunrise from our balcony on our first morning.
This was our 3rd stay at the hotel and we had previously enjoyed eating in the Bar, but unfortunately this was closed for a refurbishment.  We therefore dined in the Sika restaurant on the first night. The meal was excellent but we both felt that the wine by the glass on offer was expensive at 14 euros each. By the second night food was being offered in the Sugar Loaf lounge - again excellent food, although the service was understandably a bit slow because of the adjustment the hotel staff had to make with the bar being closed.
This is a beautiful hotel and the spa pool is the best in Ireland (in my opinion) - so relaxing and a great size for swimming.We're looking forward to coming back - my one minor request would be to provide a kettle in the rooms. We both love a cup of tea first thing in the morning and whilst coffee makers are provided, the water they produce is tepid at best. The tea at breakfast is lovely and strong by the way - and the breakfast excellent.
I'd recommend this hotel to anyone.

217,Always a fabulous stay,"Had a gorgeous stay. This was out 3rd time staying in this hotel and we always love it. We got a gorgeous room with a balcony overlooking the Sugarloaf and got an early check in which was brilliant. I got a lovely treatment in the spa on the wave bed - stunning. Followed by time in the relaxation area and time in the women's thermal suite.
We spent time in the pool and and jacuzzi area. 
Had dinner and drinks in the bar, the food was great. 
The staff were all lovely and very helpful. 
The breakfast was 5 star, always my favourite part of a hotel stay and it did not disappoint.
Will definitely be returning. Its great as a birthday treat. 
Thank you.",5,2023,02,11
217,Top class touches that made my birthday really special,"I celebrated a lovely birthday thanks to the special additions by the hotel. Delighted to be upgraded on arrival to a king suite and a lovely choc & card surprise in the room! 

The food in the restaurant was top class and service was excellent. The view of the Sugar Loaf mountain and the gorgeous gardens really added to the experience too! 

The Espa spa was the icing in the cake! I booked a facial while was arguably the best I’ve ever had and got great recommendations on products. The only downside was that I didn’t get to enjoy the jacuzzi & sauna as I had to leave for home! 

Lovely touches throughout my stay made my birthday really special.  I’ll be back asap with girlfriends. 😍",5,2023,02,09
217,Five Star Escape ,"Once you turn into the Avenue to Powerscourt you start to relax. You step away from your everyday life. I had coffee in AVOCA, lunch & evening meal in the Sika Resteraunt. A lovely walk around Powerscourt Gardens & a bit of shopping in Avoca. My Room was fabulous. The open fires in the lobby are the perfect place to relax and catch up on some reading. Staff were courteous and helpful. Every bite of the Evening Meal was gorgeous. The Apple cheesecake was the nicest dessert I ever had! To finish off my stay, breakfast was perfect, I recommend the porridge! Well done all & keep up the good work.",5,2023,02,09
217,Afternoon tea or else !,Having booked afternoon tea and arriving to the hotel we were given menus. The reason I’m writing the review is to say the menu is irrelevant. I was embarrassed at the big deal the staff made when my guests didn’t want afternoon tea. They were unwilling (and clearly by that I mean unable by management protocol )to give us any one part of the menu. The menu said scones. We couldn’t have scones. We couldn’t have sandwiches even those on the menu. We had to have all or nothing. Really? Why the many pages of the menu then? It clearly came down to the fact they want the €55 or else nothing. I would have spent the money but we didn’t want all the food. We shared it then and the white bread was completely stale as the sandwich had been made hours ago. The rest tasted well and the ambiance is so quiet but we’d have appreciated honesty rather than high class manners of not admitting that you can’t have tea and scones off the menu. You can spend €55 and that won’t include the tea or coffee for anyone else. So ours cost €67 and we didn’t eat a lot  of the food given as we didn’t want to eat it. Itemise your menu please. I’d have left a gratuity if I felt staff had been willing to be Co-operative rather than just mannerly effectively saying no you can’t have what you like and sit in that chair!,3,2023,02,08
217,Some attention to detail missing ,"Overall, we had an excellent stay. We were upgraded to a suite facing the mountains and it was extremely comfortable. Spa and food very good. Great location. 

Just a few things that made us feel it wasn't quite 5-star:

- First impressions weren't great. No signage once you come through the door from the underground parking. 

-We went straight to McGill's as we were starving after a long hike. An older lady there treated us as almost an inconvenience when we asked for a table. Not welcoming at all. Gin wasn't served in a proper gin glass. No drinks menu was given so I had no idea which gins they served. Food was good, but when I asked for vinegar, the same lady pointed at the vinegar sachets on my husband's plate for his fish and chips and said 'there's vinegar there, but I'll get you some'. Not great service. 

- Certain parts of the hotel could do with a lick of paint

- Chromecast in the room wasn't working. A staff member came to help and told us it was our phones. It wasn't. 

- In the shower, the overhead shower worked but the handheld one didn't. The handle for the overhead shower came off in my hand. Grouting was a bit grubby. One towel had a couple of stains on it.

- Got breakfast brought to the room, there was no jug of milk for the coffee. Luckily there was some uht milk in the room.

Like I said, overall, it was lovely. But all of these minor issues add up and are not things you expect of a 5-star hotel. Some improvements needed.

217,Wonderful as always...,"Myself and my family (wife, 10yo daughter and 6yo son) had a wonderful stay in The Powerscourt, this was the first time we stayed with the kids in the hotel so we were a bit apprehensive however we should not have worried, it was brilliant.
When booking we booked a family suite and I had requested a quiet room as my son is autistic and sensitive to noise, we were given a perfectly quiet room which was fantastic. The staff in all restaurant's and bars were very attentive and helpful as were the reception staff who helped us with a gift voucher issue. The food was fantastic in the bar and restaurant also. The facilities in terms of the leisure centre and pool were faultless as always unfortunately we could not get a booking in the spa which was the only extremely minor blemish on a fantastic stay, we will be back.",5,2023,02,06
217,"Nice stay, better suited for families than couples","We enjoyed our trip to Powerscourt, however we felt it fell short of the 5* experience. 
The room was extremely nice and comfortable, with a lovely view overlooking the garden. 

We ate dinner in the bar and we were very disappointed. The waiter knocked a bottle of coke on me and was not very apologetic, he simply just gave me another coke - which we were charged for. The bar itself was very cold with a strong draft where we were seated. The food itself was very nice but the menu selection was limited. 

The pool area was very nice but was crowded, with a lot of people jumping into the pool which we felt wasn’t that relaxing. 

The breakfast had a great selection and was very tasty, however it was busy and short-staffed. We ended up being at breakfast for over an hour as there was a lot of waiting. However, the food was really good so it was worth it. 

Overall I think this hotel is more suited to families, rather than couples looking for a quiet, relaxing getaway.",4,2023,02,05
217,Beautiful Hotel,Powerscourt Hotel is beautiful. Our room was honestly second to none with a beautiful balcony overlooking stunning natural scenery in the garden of Ireland. The grounds and nearby Powerscourt gardens are absolutely gorgeous incredible. The only disappointment was the hotel bar. It’s not really big enough and the layout wasn’t great - It felt like an after thought. It’s a pity because if it weren’t for that we would have happily given a five star rating.,4,2023,01,29
217,Weekend Break,"We had a fabulous relaxing break at Powerscourt Hotel.  Pure luxury from start to finish.  Lovely atmosphere in hotel, with very friendly and efficient staff.  We had dinner in both Sika Restaurant and McGills, both were just delicious.  Highly recommend this hotel if you are looking for pure class and a luxurious break.  We will definitely be visiting again.",5,2023,01,24
217,What a wonderful stay we had!,"Myself and 2 of my girlfriends had the absolute pleasure to stay in this fantastic 5* property on Saturday. We were there for a little birthday celebration for one of them and it didn't disappoint!
We had booked 1 room for the 3 of us, and on check-in, to our surprise we were kindly upgraded to 2 rooms interconnecting, this meant we had so much space for the 3 of us and didn't have to share a bed :)!

All I can say is that the little details make the difference when it comes to welcoming guests to a hotel and it is those details that are usually remembered! We walked in the rooms, there was a lovely Happy birthday plate with a couple of treats and a box of chocolate too! 
Absolutely incredible sized bedrooms and bathrooms; extremely comfortable beds, underfloor heating in the bathrooms (with a separated shower and a dip bath tub), fluffy towels, without mentioning the stunning views over the gardens and the Sugar Loaf!
Staff were extremely welcoming from the moment we stepped in Powerscourt Hotel, they literally made us feel at home and this until we left the next morning.

The spa is fab, the breakfast was also delish with again beautiful views of the hills!

My only down side is that we didn't book for 2 nights!!

So if you are looking for a bit of R&R away from town, to catch up, have a good time and feel at home in a 5* property, go and book your stay!

We will definitely be back to try out the afternoon tea!

Thank you to all the team who made us feel very welcome!
Until next time

217,Stunning five star experience,Just back from an overnight stay with my partner. Our check in was so quick &stress free. The staff couldn’t be more helpful. Our room was so big &beautiful views of the Wicklow mountains & stunning gardens. We enjoyed a dip in the pool followed by a delicious 3 course dinner in the fabulous Sika restaurant. Thank you to all the management and staff for making our stay so memorable! We can’t wait to go back. The scenery and gardens around the hotel are breathtaking and kept to five star standard.,5,2023,01,19

217,Disappointing customer service,"My partner's family and I gathered here for a wedding dinner celebration. We were very excited to spend our time in the hotel since it's supposed to be 5 stars and it was my first time in Ireland. Turns out some of the staff have no manners. After spending almost our entire day there, the hotel told us to get a taxi through this app that turned out to be useless and we could no get a ride, the Manager seeing this, did not move a finger to help us whatsoever. This was very late and it was very cold out, so not ideal at all for a walk but that is what we had to do since the staff did not care to help.
And as someone who has been working in the hospitality industry for years, it was very disappointing to end a day of celebration this way. You would expect a 5 star hotel that is well known to have various ways of mobilizing clients if needed.",1,2023,01,13
217,Loved this hotel.,"Loved this hotel from the room to the food.  It was great.  It was a last-minute stay of two nights due to a flight delay.  We were so fortunate to have the delay.  

 I would love to get a hold of the ""secret scent"" from the lobby.  It was a beautiful scent.",5,2023,01,11
217,Wedding celebration dinner,"14 family members gathered for dinner to celebrate our eldest's wedding.  Hotel insisted we use a particular app to arrange a taxi. The hotel refused to get involved.  Our taxi was to arrive at 11.10 pm, this was the quickest they could  give us. At exactly 11.10 I got a message to say the taxi would not be turning up! The night manager was no help. Obviously he never came across the word  empathy. 

We had to start walking.  This hotel is in the middle of nowhere,  it was a freezing cold icy night. Unless you are a staying guest they don't care. Obviously we didn't want to ruin the Happy couples day. They were staying in the hotel for 3 nights 

It appears you need to be a staying guest to get the 5* treatment

The Westin or Shelbourne hotels give better service",1,2023,01,10
217,A True Example of Quality Customer Service,"The accommodations at Powers Court for a small family is excellent. The children enjoy the pool, and the adults enjoy the room, the attention to detail, the ambiance and the food.  The Powers Court sets an example that other hotels could and should follow.  It is truly a class by itself.  My family has stayed at Powers Court several times over the years when home to Ireland to see family.",5,2023,01,10
217,Fantastic overnight stay for a group,"I arranged an overnight and dinner stay for a group of 18 people in early December.  The entire experience was fantastic - the staff couldn't do enough for us, the food and service in the restaurant were amazing and the bedrooms were absolute luxury.  Every member of our group had a wonderful experience and we all can't wait to go back next year!",5,2023,01,09
217,winter couples break and family summer fun,"I've stayed here a few times with my wife on a winter couples treat and for three nights in the summer with the whole family of six, four older teenagers. It might be a bit pricey but for pure luxury, style, class and amazing environs, it beats everything in Leinster. We loved every stay and were glad we splashed out.",5,2023,01,07
217,Lovely stay,"Stayed here for 2 nights from the 2nd - 4th January. My husband booked it for my 30th. We were upgraded to a suite for no extra charge & didn’t even realise until we opened the door and oh my, it was absolutely amazing. The space, underfloor heating & the bed was so comfortable. We found staff so pleasant, loved the Irish bar & we ate in Sika on our last night, the food was outstanding. My husband had pork cheek for starter, fillet of beef for main. I got the cured salmon for starter & duck for main. The food & wine was beautiful. It was such a relaxing stay & if you get a lovely day, definitely explore the gardens & even call down to the village & eat in the local arms country house. The only downside I would say is the spa definitely isn’t 5*, the pool etc isn’t the nicest we’ve ever been at, it’s a pity it doesn’t overlook the beautiful gardens.",5,2023,01,06
217,24 hours of luxury!,"The staff were exemplary! From the second we pulled up we were greeted by a friendly bellboy who took our bags and parked our car (at no charge), a door man who warmly welcomed us and took his top hat off to us! The check in staff were so friendly, all smiles and kind words and empathy. We’re Platinum elite Marriott members and they dutifully upgraded us to a beautiful suite which we wholly appreciated. The food, the full Irish in the morning, the late checkout were outstanding . It was 24 hours of pure luxury! Thank you for your wonderful service and stunning luxury hotel!",5,2022,12,22
217,A taste of the good life,"Total luxury. Stunning setting, amazing suite with views of the mountains. A room almost the size of an apartment. Chandeliers and flatscreen TV in the bathroom.

Combine that with the terrific location and the fabulous views of the Sugar Loaf (epecially from the spa), it's absolutely wonderful.  We shall cetainly return in December 2023 if not before.",5,2022,12,14
217,"Great staff, beautiful hotel, amazing surroundings!! Top marks to everyone!!","This hotel never fails! Love This  place. Night away for my wifes birthday. Staff so good , room was absolutely beautiful. We had dinner in Sika restaurant great food and ambience.
The staff and management here really know how to make you feel special,  we have been coming here for 15 years approx. And the hotel surroundings are beautiful too!
Top marks to everyone; we are returning with the family in January!!!",5,2022,12,12
217,Slipping down the ratings.,"I have here several times before as a Bonvoi member. Before this visit it lived up to its 5 stars. Not now. I had booked an ESPA package but when phoning to confirm times I was told that I had no booking but would put me in for a cancellation. None came. Then on drive up a separate staff member tried to confirm my bookings for that afternoon! Confusion. 
But other things too. It’s five star. No longer a turn down service. Nobody to meet and greet at front entrance. Decor looking tired. Sika restaurant Great. McGills pub has food that is bettered by my local in terms of choice and adventure. .  And the kippers for breakfast. Waitress did not understand what I meant and bought me a poached egg. Took it back and gave me the smallest saltiest burnt Kipper I’ve seen.  I would have sent it back but had been waiting 10 mins. I do think this hotel is now overpriced and management have to run a tighter ship. It’s sunk considerably from about 4 years ago.",3,2022,12,10
217,Luxury stay,"I recently stayed in powers court to celebrate a birthday , and I can honestly say that from the moment we walked through the hotel doors we were treated like we were special . From the girls at checkin , the young lad that brought our bags to the room, everyone went out of their way to make sure we enjoyed our stay.  We had food and drinks in the bar . We enjoyed a swim in the pool. And the room was out standing. The hotel grounds are beautiful.  We took a little walk to Avoca and had a coffee. If your looking for a memorable place to stay then this is the hotel for you.
You will not be disappointed.   ",5,2022,12,08
217,A Special Hotel,"Unfortunately, we were only able to stay here for one night, but we'll definitely be back; what a treat! We play golf first on the West course which was gorgeous, a bright cold Autumn Day in November; we'd booked the play & stay overnight which included Dinner, B&B and an evening meal; it was fabulous!
The staff were excellent, the hotel was welcoming with a pleasant atmosphere in the bar & restaurant.",5,2022,12,07
217,Great Expectations,"Stayed here a couple weeks ago following an event at the nearby Powerscourt House. We had great expectations given the hotel’s reputation and from what others told us. While there was nothing particularly wrong with the hotel, it didn’t quite live up to expectation.

Starting with the good, the hotel is clean & there are few hotels located in more scenic and picturesque settings.the room was big and spacious with a huge bed. Plenty of space to chill out and relax as well as to sleep. The view out over the back (or maybe front) was fab too.

Breakfast was good - huge selection of food and all very tasty. It was a serve yourself / buffet type setup. The breakfast room was a little busier than I would normally like but it was a peak time of your so that’s life.

We arrived mid afternoon on a midweek day, the reception area wasn’t too busy however the check in felt rushed. The staff managing the check in was very eager for us to book different activities in advance including breakfast and/or the pool. This was conducive to a relaxing stay and not something I have experienced in other top end resort’s. 

While we did end up booking both our breakfast and a trip to the pool in advance (for fear we would end up missing out on both), the pool was relatively empty at the time of the visit. While this was positive and enjoyable, it also highlighted that maybe the rushed check in wasn’t really necessary. Side point on this, it actually took me an age to find the pool because it isn’t clearly signed that it’s in the same area as the spa.  

Breakfast situation discussed above, no real issues there beyond it being a little busy which suggests a lot of ppl being booked in at same time - could have been alleviated at rushed checking by asking questions around whether we wanted to come down at a quieter/busier time etc particularly given we advised that we were quite flexible in that regard.

My only other gripe was the evening service where it was difficult (almost to the point of impossible) to order / arrange a drink. We had tipped back to the hotel following the event at around midnight and decided it might be nice to have a couple of drinks before bed. Nobody in the party was particularly inebriated or disruptive but my goodness was it tough to get served. Given the reputation of the hotel, I expected there would be a dedicated bar area however we were told we could sit in the reception area on the same floor as reception (no problem with that to be honest). Area was nice and spacious and pretty much empty albeit there was no ambience or life in the place- don’t even think there was soft music playing.  We had to place order at reception ( where we checked in earlier in the day) and the drinks eventually arrived.  The whole set up was quite exhausting to the extent we called it a night after just a single drink. That whole aspect of the experience was in complete contrast to that in another premium hotel earlier in the year where nothing was too much bother and could be still sitting in the bar now if I wanted. Defo a sense of could and should do better in terms of this. 

Plenty of parking onsite and right outside the door to main reception. No major issue there.

Onsite amenities are pretty good, there is the golf course, the house & gardens, the river walk and even the waterfall all in close proximity. We had seen the house & waterfall previously so took in the river walk this time, this was pretty enjoyable to be fair and I would recommend.  As above, the location and scenery in this part of Wicklow are second to none…. Would be a great base for anyone who wanted to hike the hills and see some of Ireland’s finest landscape.",3,2022,11,12
217,Everything you'd expect from a 5 star hotel 👏,"Amazing experience. Everything was perfection, and the food was simply divine. Fabulous break. Stunning grounds, lots to do in and around the hotel. Nothing negative to say at all. Will certainly be returning when we have the chance. 👍👍",5,2022,11,11
217,Phenomenal Stay - 5Stars,"Beautiful drive into the hotel, amazing welcome on arrival. Heather from reception checked us in & our room was available straight away. She was so friendly & professional made sure we any reservations we needed made like dinner or any the many activities they have to offer, gave us a map of the grounds and explained all that was on offer. 
The room was fantastic, big in size and everything one would need. Touch screen functions throughout. We had a beautiful view of sugar loaf mountain and gardens. Beds are super comfortable. 
We visiting the gardens and all the hotel had to offer like the incredible chess board. 
Swimming pool is amazing & the spa looked incredible
We ate dinner in the Bar - we had cocktails, wine, the cheese board and a Fish & chips for €80 and was left satisfied.
We had breakfast in Sika restaurant included in our nights stay and the staff there are as equally friendly (even had take away box’s to help ourselves to fresh fruit etc for the day ahead which was a fantastic touch and great way to not waste food leftovers) 
The breakfast has everything to offer and so fresh & tasty! 

The grounds are extremely well kept and beautiful to walk around even with the umbrella. 
Shout out to Lorna, the staff throughout & Dave at the front door who waved us off and gave great recommendations for the area!! 

Phenomenal stay & I cannot wait to revisit",5,2022,11,09
217,Family birthday stay,"What a fantastic hotel.  From the minute we arrived,  the reception we got,  the friendliness of the staff,  nothing was too much.  The check in, excellent.   The restaurant omg, the staff,  the service and the food.  Breakfast was amazing, so relaxed.  Its definitely a must stay.",5,2022,11,08
217,Luxurious counrty retreat close to the city,"As a Dublin native, who lives in reasonably close proximity to the Powercourt Hotel, my stay here felt like a truly restful, indulgent and luxurious birthday treat. Given that Powerscourt is situated a mere 20km south of Dublin City Centre; its stunning location in the foothills of the Wicklow mountains feels a world apart. 

While it is infinitely possible to relax, happily pamper oneself and simply lounge by the pool/spa area (having possibly over-indulged in the delicious breakfast buffet), there is plenty to enjoy too if you're seeking a more active break. The hotel offers maps of the woodland walks and courtesy bikes are provided so you can delight in the beautifully manicured hotel grounds or the adjacent Powercourt gardens and waterfall. Equally, the picturesque Enniskerry village has many delightful cafés and craft shops and there are numerous hill-walking routes in the local area. 

I would highly recommend this hotel to anyone and imagine it would be particularly lovely at Christmas, its traditional but opulent décor and breath-taking views of the landscape, lend themselves to festive break away. The rooms were incredibly spacious, spotless and with spectacular views of the rising sun. The staff in the McGills bar, in particular, went out of their way to make this a very special occasion, thank you for the thoughtful accommodations and ensuring that this visit was one to remember! ",5,2022,11,08
217,An enjoyable stay but not 5 stars,"We were really looking forward to this trip leading up to it but unfortunately we're quite disappointed by certain elements.

We enjoyed the pool and it amenities as well as the hotels grounds which were all pristine and really relaxing. The reception staff were very kind and accommodating throughout our stay. Likewise the dinner staff at the Sika restaurant went above and beyond to cater to dietary requirements within our party. 

Unfortunately, this level of care didn't extend to all areas of our visit. Our tea and coffee wasn't replenished in our room by housekeeping and the lack of turn down service was quite disappointing a very small thing but an element I'd expect more of in a 5 star hotel. 

Additionally at breakfast, it took a considerable amount of time to be seated and we weren't offered any tea, coffee or additional freshly prepared food until we were standing up to depart breakfast having availed of the buffet up to that point. 

Small things but they unfortunately skewed the experience for us and for the price vs the experience we'd be very hesitant to return. ",3,2022,11,07
217,Luxury mini-moon break,A luxury hotel in a stunning location. From the moment we walked into the hotel it was serene. It has been on our bucket list for a while and we’re so glad to finally have made the trip down. We walked around Enniskerry village and took a drive to Powerscourt waterfall just a short distance from the hotel. We also visited a nearby agricultural centre/museum. The garden centre is a must as well. Will avoid during school holidays in the future for an extra tranquil experience. But will 100% be coming back in the future. Staff were very pleasant and the bed was amazing. McGills restaurant was fabulous although you cannot make a reservation - just an excuse for a few extra drinks in the foyer :),5,2022,11,06
217,Amazing is not enough ⭐️⭐️⭐️⭐️⭐️,"We chose this hotel by accident and really it turned out to be the best decision ever. What  experience! The staff was super polite and very helpful. The pop was fluff music full of Irish music (on Saturday) which was very special cultural experience for us traveling from abroad. Amazing! 
At the pool reception the lady was super kind for us. Congratulations to the management and congratulations for the team. It was beyond our expectations.",5,2022,11,02
217,Outstanding location with a focus on great service and attention to detail,"We stayed here for a week during the (UK) October half term. It was everything we had hoped it would be- and more. 

We were lucky enough to have a room with a mountain view and waking up every morning and seeing the sun rise up through the trees over Sugar Loaf mountain was spectacular. 

The staff were phenomenal- nothing was ever too much trouble. From housekeeping, to the restaurants and lounge, and the spa in between, they all really went the extra mile - and we really appreciated that. Eamonn Casey, the general manager, was also a real delight and made us feel exceptionally welcome.

We made the most of the spa facilities and the pool. Afternoon tea in the lounge was outstanding. At breakfast, I felt like a kid in the candy store- such was the range of options to choose from. The hotel was clean, calm and comfortable. A real highlight of the trip for us was the falconry experience in the grounds of the hotel, which the hotel staff organised for us.

I couldn't recommend the hotel- or its staff- enough.  If you want a luxurious stay, in a beautiful location, just a short drive from a major city centre, then this is the place for you. 

Thank you Powerscourt- we will be back.",5,2022,11,02
217,A truly spectacular Hotel,"Myself and my partner and our 5 year old had an incredible week's stay at the Powerscourt Hotel. We were impressed by the friendly staff, the spectacular decor and inspiring surrounding grounds. We loved the giant chess set, the spa treatments ( the ice bucket!!! ) and the afternoon tea. Treat yourself to meeting falcons, owls and hawks with the Bird Man, an expert who the hotel are in touch with. I can't wait for our next visit. ",5,2022,11,02
217,Amazing Halloween get away,Booked in last minute in this beautiful hotel. Our stay was amazing with a nice Halloween amenity for our daughter in the room. Pool was super and the breakfast was delicious. Staff could not have done more to ensure our stay was just perfect. We can’t wait to go back soon. Thank you to all the team for making this an amazing last minute get away!!,5,2022,11,01
217,"Absolutely stunning, in every way!","The location of the hotel is spectacular. On arrival , the reception area, foyer, lounge are so fabulous. Hugely warm welcome at reception desk and help with our car and luggage. Truly 5 star greeting from the team there. We booked Mountain view rooms - so worth it - what a view! The bedrooms are luxurious: very spacious, traditional design, but with all the modern updates and beautifully decorated. We had a fabulous lunch in Sika restaurant. Each different dish (we had 3) was delicious. Wine menu lovely. Staff very attentive and friendly. Spa is amazing. Never felt busy as it is well designed for space and relaxation. Team at the spa also so friendly and welcoming. We had room service dinner as we wanted to enjoy our beautiful bedrooms and views - it food was excellent. Breakfast excellent - buffet, with every choice you could want.  This is a very special place and is truly 5 star.  The team there maintain such high standards all across the property and  deliver a super service. We will be back as soon as we can.",5,2022,10,31
217,Spa day with friend,"A fabulous luxury treat day. Everything was perfect,  from the professional and friendly staff,  to the presentation and quality of treatment and spa areas. Food was lovely, and they catered for diet restrictions. The serenity room and view is just so beautiful.",5,2022,10,28
217,Relax and lose yourself in the beauty that surrounds this beautiful hotel,"Absolutely beautiful, breath taking surroundings, the room was spectacular, spotlessly clean, hotel is amazing, the attention to detail is second to none ,staff are Absolutely fantastic, a beautiful relaxing stay, wonderful service from drinks , room service, breakfast Could not fault a thing.",5,2022,10,19
217,Impressive and unforgettable stay.,"We go on weekend in hotel only once a year to celebrate our birthdays, this year it was focused on me as I was turning 50.
My fiance made the booking.
From now on I don't know from where to start as all was perfect.
The hotel and surrounding are impressive, staff so dedicated to their job, too many to name but Tatu was excellent, helping us with suitcases, explained the hotel layout, the room, air conditioning... came back to take pictures from us, drop us and collect us to town, such a nice man and enjoying chatting with him.
The room was so big as the bathroom, all very clean.
In the evening we went to the restaurant, menu and wine list was very nice and what we get on plate was even nicer, my favourite part of the meal is the dessert and I was not disappointed, got a birthday plate with very nice and tasty home made chocolate.
Morning breakfast, with plenty of choices and good quality products (waffle, muffins, 2 kind of brown bread...) plus all the regular, large choice of milks, yogurt...
Went to pool and spa, very enjoyable with friendly staff.
Use of free bicycles, what was very nice to visit the surrounding.
Went to the Mc Gillis pub with lovely Anne ( I think!) behind the counter.
We went for Afternoon Tea, where the level of food was again amazing especially the sweet part! The choice of tea was enormous. Staff explained very well the menu and came back on regular basis to check if all was fine, got a second birthday plate!
So our stay was do enjoyable due to the amazing and dedicated staff with a mention for all staff behind the scene. 
The food was at a very high level.
Free bicycles, free drop in town, Spa, hotel surrounding...all those are very nice extra that we appreciate.
Too many things to say about our stay but this is an hotel where we'll definitely coming back, for an other stay or if we have to celebrate something.
The only negative point was the prices of the drinks, but I guess that after Covid and with the current increase of prices, that makes the prices of drink a bit expensive, but this stay will still staying for a long time in our memories.

217,16th wedding anniversary 💕 ,Such a amazing hotel . The staff are also excellent at there job . They made us both feel so comfortable.  The views from the hotel are beautiful.  Breakfast and dinner was a 10/10. I can't wait to go back.  I would highly recommend powerscourt . The rooms are spotless clean . The bar is like your on the town .If your thinking of booking powerscourt go for it you will not be disappointed. ,5,2022,10,14
217,Book extra time.,"Breathtaking views. Plan a few days here. My 2 night stay was not enough to experience the wonderful gardens, spa and golf. I made my choice and enjoyed a beautiful time here. Staff were friendly and the hotel was quiet. A place to escape. The room was clean and spacious. The tea was delicious and I was graciously allowed to have a table with a very late reservation so I really appreciate the service.",5,2022,10,13
217,The Wonderful Powerscourt Hotel,"I stayed in the Powerscourt Hotel in Co Wicklow recently and I would highly recommend it. It is pure luxury.  The hotel is set in the beautiful Wicklow mountains with amazing views from all windows. The hotel itself is absolutely breath-taking from the minute you walk into reception.  The rooms are gorgeous and fitted out to the highest standard with even USB ports beside the plug sockets!  The bed was the most comfortable I have ever slept on, it was like sleeping on clouds.  The staff were fabulous. Each and every member of staff we encountered were exceptionally friendly, extremely obliging and efficient.  The food was excellent. We played golf at the Powerscourt Golf course which was a couple of minutes away but even if you don't play golf, there are so many beautiful walks nearby. I have absolutely no complaints.  I can't wait to go back! ",5,2022,10,11
217,A remarkable 5 star Hotel,"This hotel is a gem just outside of Dublin.

We enjoyed a very relaxing experience with Family. We had reserved 2 rooms, one being a triple room which was very spacious with three seperate beds. The rooms and beds are so comfortable, well furnished and spotlessly clean and maintained.
A very warm welcome on arrival from the doormen and reception team. We enjoyed drinks in the Sugar Loaf Lounge before heading to Sika restaurant for a very enjoyable meal. 

McGills bar after dinner, is a  great option to enjoy some drinks in a  place with a great atmosphere and friendly welcoming staff. Ann in particular in McGills was so helpful and chatted with, she was so genuine and warm.

We of course visited ESPA which was an oasis of pure calm (outside of family times) again very clean and well maintained with a very warm welcome from the staff who are extremely courteous. 

Breakfast the following morning was fantastic and  well complimented with the stunning views of Sugar Loaf Mountain in the background of the perfectly manicured front lawn of the Hotel. 

A truly memorable visit to a stunning 5 star property. Every staff member we interacted with was very friendly and engaging.

Would highly recommend for a visit as somewhere very close to Dublin city but feels like you are a million miles away.",5,2022,10,10
217,Absolutely grand,"Wow. Just wow. Gorgeous hotel, excellent service. Spacious rooms. We did the falconry experience, which was unforgettable. Then we had the packed picnic basket lunch, which was just for two of us but was enough food for four people easily. They provided everything we needed and a giant warm blanket. We took it out to the tables in the back of the hotel and just marveled and the spread of cheeses in front of us. And the spa! I had an incredibly relaxing massage, and the steam room has little twinkle lights like looking up at the stars.
 I think the only thing holding this place back from complete perfection is that there aren't enough food options on site. I would love to come stay here for a week and relax and get away. But there's only one casual eatery and one very high end one. Having some kind of coffee shop/gift shop with takeaway options would do wonders. Many five star hotels have things like this.",5,2022,10,01
217,Good but pricey,"Stayed here as a base to explore Wicklow.  On the face of it this is a very impressive hotel, the building is imposing and its located in a very beautiful setting.  Personally I thought it all felt a bit soul-less and artificial though, maybe because of the shear scale of the place along with the fact that its a relatively new building with an opulent, traditional style.  Our room was very spacious, comfortable and clean. We had a large balcony area and unfortunately it could do with a bit of TLC, weeds growing up trough the paving tiles and was a bit grubby out there, just felt a bit neglected. Snacks and drinks were available in the room but were ridiculously overpriced, at lot of 5 star places have these included in your room price so it came across as tad stingy to charge for them!!
We ate in the bar on two evenings; food and service were great,  just a bit odd to have it created to resemble a traditional Irish pub, quite jarring when you come back out in to the hotel itself with its wildly different decor!  Breakfast was also excellent, attentive staff with a huge selection at the buffet - really something for all tastes.  Nice grounds to walk around and of course Powerscourt gardens next store so really a very scenic part of Ireland to enjoy!",4,2022,09,26
217,Powerscourt Perfection!,"What an amazing two days at the beautiful Powerscourt Hotel. Stunning location, fantastic facilities and very elegantly decorated. Our room was so comfortable I didn’t want to leave! Best of all the attentive and very kind staff. Nothing was too much trouble for them to make our stay absolutely perfect. Already planning to visit again next year!",5,2022,09,22
217,"No Irish Staff, Bad Housekeeping, Great food, Beautiful Location","TLDR; Little to no Irish Staff, housekeeping inconsistent, no concierge, no Marriott recognition at check-in, taxi issues. I had the opportunity to once again stay at the Powerscourt for the first time since the pandemic. The trip was part business part pleasure. I arrived on Monday morning to have my room ready but I wasn't offered an upgrade/welcome gift at all by reception even with my Bonvoy Status (previously I was when I last stayed here). The room itself was big and there was a nice hello in the form of some chocolate. However the room also had a bit of a strange smell, a lot of bugs and some issues with the windows. I found housekeeping to be very unreliable during my stay. Sometimes they would visit and spot clean the room. One night out of my 5 nights stay I had a turn down service. I requested a service also one day but after no one showed up for hours with the service light on I asked reception. Nobody turned up even after the call with the front desk team and that was disappointing. On that topic I was very surprised by the lack of Irish folks on the staff given that we were in Ireland I expected to be greeted by the wit and banter of the locals but there were none. Neither was there a concierge. Staffing overall felt like they were operating on a skeleton crew for the size of the hotel. I had issues with the Taxis also. The apps would cancel (happened to me 4 times in a row) and the local service left me and my young family in the lurch on our last day even after booking with them directly and we almost missed our train for the next leg of our trip. The positives; beautiful setting and excellent food. I'd consider visiting again but would hope that the hotel listens to the feedback and addresses the staffing and housekeeping issues mostly as my experience definitely was not 5 star given the price point.",3,2022,09,20
217,Great first night stay in Ireland,"Very nice stay, glad we picked this property. Hotel is amazing and service is top notch. We got a great suite room, I was tempted after reading reviews to use my upgrade to get a better view, but being titanium elite, thought they would upgrade me. They were very busy, so no available upgrades. The room was perfectly fine, very spacious. 
We had lunch at the main restaurant and it was average at best, service was very good..just didn’t think the food was very good. Breakfast the next morning however was as billed, outstanding. We had dinner at the Irish pub, which was very good. We got out before the Irish music started. Property is expensive and might be very well worth it. Great stay, thanks.",4,2022,09,19
217,A wonderful and memorable 2 night stay,"We had a wonderful 2 night stay at Powerscourt Hotel,  from the moment we arrived,  we were greeted by very pleasant and helpful porter staff, check in was straightforward and again very professional staff.  Beautiful reception area, we loved the floral decorations 
The porter, who was a Croatian member of staff, guided us to our beautiful suite and explained how all devices worked. Very helpful.
Our room was on the 3rd floor, with a large balcony overlooking the manicured garden.
Loved the interior decoration, everything was spotlessly clean! Loved the Nespresso coffee machine!
We dined in Sika Restaurant for our 2 evening meals, very creative menu and beautifully presented and again attentive staff.
Thank you once again for making our stay so special.",5,2022,09,17
217,Pleasant Stay,"The hotel is well situated away from the hustle & bustle of Dublin City. It's a great base to explore the surrounding countryside and to relax. The staff are friendly and helpful. We received a warm welcome on arrival. The rooms were spacious and comfortable. 

We travelled for my mother's 89th  birthday and it was a nice surprise to receive a cake after dinner in the Sika Restaurant. Breakfast had all the usual options with a buffet and menu selection available.  There was no omelet or pancake station but both were available to order.

We did have a delay receiving food one evening  when we ate in McGills but it was promptly remedied when highlighted. Room service was also good.

Do get a room with a view of the Sugarloaf if possible - the other rooms don't have much of a view.",4,2022,09,13
217,Impossible to get through to this hotel,I have tried to get through on their phone line for the last 45 minutes. Total waste of time. Each call rings out. I tried all 4 options but no one picks up. Very bad first impression for guests looking to book.,1,2022,09,10
217,Disappointment,Stayed  last Sunday 04th September for our 25th Wedding anniversary.  Bedroom stunning. Evening meal very disappointing. Breakfast lovely and good choice. When booking we advised the hotel it was a special occasion our 25th. I would have expected that to have at least been acknowledged in some way especially for a 5* hotel. We have stayed in many hotels for birthdays and always acknowledged simply by Happy whatever on your dessert!,2,2022,09,10
217,Top of the bill level of service,"We normally don’t stay in such big hotels, but the level of service and the way things were arranged by the staff, didn’t have you the feeling that you were staying in a big hotel. Very personal attention from the stay who always took their time. Highly recommend",5,2022,09,07
217,Stunning Stay,"This has got to be one of the best hotels we have ever stayed in. The facilities, the rooms, the service were fantastic. When we arrived, I mentioned that it was my mums birthday and they offered us a free upgrade for both rooms, the room that my parents got was superb, it had a balcony overlooking the gardens, truly stunning! Food was great, we wanted to watch the football in the pub so they put this on the tv. We asked for kids meals to be made into adult meals in the pub, this was no trouble for them. We had such an amazing stay from the minute we arrived - would highly highly recommend!",5,2022,09,03
217,Most Amazing Wedding Anniversary,"My Wife and I spent our 4th wedding anniversary at Powerscourt, and we had the most amazing time. The hotel is absolutely stunning and the staff are incredible, professional and extremely accommodating. Everyone at the Hotel could not do enough to make us feel special. The facilities at the hotel are of the highest standard and I would recommend using them all! We will definitely be back.",5,2022,08,30
217,Consistent high standards,"Five years since our last break here and everything is still top notch. 
Staff professional and junior staff are a pleasure to deal with, a smile and polite service. 

Perhaps Sika restaurant could alter the dinner menu a little to suit those who love a brilliant steak?

Book a room facing the beautiful garden to avoid the constant drone of air conditioning, a real shame that this still an issue for 5 star hotels.",5,2022,08,29
217,Five star standard,"The hotel and staff meet the 5 star standard overall from concierge to bedroom. The only irritation is the slightly complicated lounge service after 10pm when you went to have a drink before bed.
We are in the pub where the staff and food was definitely above a pub standard. However, you can’t book a table so if it’s busy it could be an issue.
The Spa is stunning and super family friendly.
The breakfast is an experience in itself. Definitely one of the best. 
The wonderful concierge manager reflects all that is great about the hotel.
I am a Bonvoy Gold member and this is definitely star hotel in the Marriott portfolio.",4,2022,08,28
217,Amazing getaway for my wife's birthday!,"Our room was amazing, and the views of the grounds from the balcony were outstanding. The giant chess board with the Wicklow Mountains in the background was absolutely wonderful to wake up to.
The staff was very welcoming, pleasant to talk with and VERY helpful. Stephan helped us to our room and took the time to introduce us to the modern conveniences in the suite, as well as what to visit while in the area. He pointed us to the Powerscourt Estate and gardens, and the waterfall, which were amazing, and also the walking paths and the distillery nearby. That evening we had dinner at McGill's Pub, where we enjoyed a very nice meal and conversation with other guests. The next day we hiked Great Sugar Loaf Mountain and could see the Powerscourt Hotel and Estate when looking to the north. It was just as amazing in the distance.
Thank you for helping make our visit to Ireland even more special!!",5,2022,08,27
217,Beautiful hotel in a peaceful setting,"We stayed her with three of our kids at the beginning of August.  The hotel is beautiful.  They did a great job blending it into the surrounding landscape and nearby Powerscourt estate.  The hotel seems historic, and you would never guess it was built in 2007.  We stayed in a single bedroom suite, which connects to a to room queen through the large dressing room.  It takes about half an hour to get to the hotel from the Dublin airport.  The immediate grounds of the hotel itself are very simple without much to do outside.  Inside, there is a beautiful indoor pool and spa. I think it's the surrounding estate that really makes the hotel special.  You can walk right down the street to the Powerscourt estate and their breathtaking gardens, the golf course and the distillery.  They also have complimentary bikes that you can ride along the river, which my kids really enjoyed.  The service is top notch.  The front desk staff and the bellmen are wonderfully friendly and helpful.  

Pros:
-Easy to get to
-Beautiful Setting
-Friendly and helpful Staff
-Nearby Powerscourt Garden (ranked 3rd in the world by Nat Geographic)

Cons:
-The air conditioning did not cool our room properly 
-Not much to do for young kids
-The service is inconsistent at Sika, the main restaurant.  I literally had to beg someone to wait on us and bring me coffee one day.  Then I asked for creamer/ milk and couldn't get anyone to bring it.  They seem to relay on a team effort at the restaurant and this wasn't always effective.  ",5,2022,08,26
217,Beautiful experience breakfast unbelievable,"I booked a night away here for me and my mum. We had the best time ever - such a beautiful place to stay.
I booked the mountain view suite , the view was absolutely stunning. We also requested a balcony so were able to have coffees sitting out- so gorgeous.
We had dinner at the Sika restaurant- the staff were fantastic and couldn’t have been nicer to us. Unfortunately the food wasn’t the kind of high standard we were expecting but the ambience and setting made the evening a very pleasant one! 
The breakfast was absolutely amazing - buffet was unbelievable and the eggs and avo and pancakes I will remember forever. 

We walked the river walk and went to the spa for treatments the next day. The whole experience there was so special. Our lunch before the treatment was delicious and our waiter Shine couldn’t have done more for us. 

Really was a fantastic stay ! Also the cocktails in the sugarloaf were so tasty ! 

Highly recommend this gorgeous place to anyone looking for a special weekend 🌟🌟",5,2022,08,23
217,A little bit of heaven,"Stayed at the Powerscort Hotel for 4 nights this month to celebrate my birthday.  Our room a deluxe king was absolutely beautiful so spacious and bright, we did not opt for a mountain view but we had a view of trees to the side of hotel, which was perfect for us. Beautiful decor, bathroom was amazing his and her sinks big bathtub and separate shower. it's the nicest room I've ever stayed in.  Breakfast in the Sika restaurant was buffet or you can choose to order from menu.  Perfect display of delicious food everything that I wanted.  Dinner in Sika was so beautiful we both had the fillet steak devine.  The food in McGills bar was also fabulous and nice relaxing atmosphere.  We used the pool and gym everyday great facilities.  Beautiful hotel, beautiful location with the gardens just beside you, powerscort waterfall a 5km walk which we did.  We also did the whisky tour and tasting in Fercullen. Highly recommend anyone to treat yourself to a stay at this beautiful hotel,  it is a little bit of heaven.  Can't wait to go back.

217,Great stay!,"Stayed for 3 nights fabulous place to stay, just 30 mn from dublin!.  From moment we arrived staff made us feel very welcomed.  

The food in McGills bar fantastic!  Great vibe.  We ended up eating there 3 nights.   Great fish and chips.

We had a fantastic suite!!!!  Separate living room and kitchen!  Loved it could have stayed a week!  

Gym- equipment pretty dated and gym on the  small side.

Golf Course - in pristine shape we played every day.

Breakfast - okay not too many options.  Staff very nice.   

Beautiful grounds to walk around and explore!",5,2022,08,22
217,Hotel is nice but don't expect good or even competent customer service!,"Reserved (using payment details) the spa offer online which included treatment, breakfast and dinner for my parents 40th Anniversary which I was paying for, obviously. Had an email from them to say it had been cancelled and after speaking on the phone was assured it hadn't been cancelled and it had just been a mistake and booked in on the double on their end. I then spoke to them 3 times further on both telephone and email, to make sure everything ran smoothly, including paying for some added extras on the day my parents arrived. As far as I was aware they had my details, as I'd spoken to them numerous times (and even if they hadn't, they'd never alluded to the fact they hadn't on any correspondence I had), they had my payment details as they'd already taken payment for additional extras and had spoken to me on the phone and they'd also re-confirmed my email address with my parents on check-in. They still proceeded to hold my parents ransom on check out, citing they didn't have my details and caused a whole load of undue stress and embarrassment to my parents as apparently they did not have my details and the bill hadn't been paid.  Not to mention, trying to over charge me when my mum called to rectify, as they never bothered to look up their own systems. Reception obviously don't communicate with their own in-house online booking colleagues and vice versa. Embarrassing for an apparent 5 star facility, as well my parents who had to use their own initiative as the reception staff clearly didnt have any and solve their problem for them whilst a queue was building up behind, creating and atmosphere of tension and criminalizing my parents, making them 'wait, until it is sorted' . The experience ruined what would have been a lovely weekend!",3,2022,08,22
217,Not a five star hotel,"My family and I stayed at this hotel in July for a couple of days.  One can see that this once was a beautiful hotel that was worthy of a five star rating, but that is no longer the case.  The exterior is beautiful although a bit dated and in need of updating.  The best part is the location and beautiful views of the mountains.  

In an effort to manage costs, Marriott has staffed the hotel with very young professionals who are not mature enough to provide good service.  When we first arrived at the hotel, we ate at Silka restaurant for a late lunch.  The restaurant was not very busy - only a few tables occupied, and yet they forgot my son's order, and did not realize it until they brought the other orders and I pointed out that one was missing.

Then when we went to bed, we noticed that several of the pillows smelled like bad body odor.  We called down to the front desk and they brought replacement pillows, two of which were pregnancy pillows stuffed into pillowcases that had been sprayed with Febreeze to smell better.  It was too late to complain again, so we just dealt with it.  The next morning we went to the front desk and complained about the pillows.  Shortly after breakfast they brought replacement pillows - one of which was blood-stained and the other which my son quickly smelled and complained that it also smelled like body odor.  We went back to the front desk and complained, and shortly thereafter the housekeeping manager came to the room and we had to explain that we had been through three sets of pillows.  It was obvious there had been no communication between the front desk and the housekeeping manager.  The housekeeping manager apologized and brought replacement pillows which seemed to be relatively new.  For a hotel that claims to be five star, it should not take four attempts to get good pillows that are not blood-stained or smell like bad body odor.  

We told the housekeeping manager and the front desk that we wanted to speak to the general manager - a man named Eamonn Casey, and we only heard from him after we had checked out of the hotel and were on our way to the airport.   

Overall the hotel was okay, with below average service, and definitely not worthy of a five star rating.",2,2022,08,21
217,Family reunion,"Memorable, fun & relaxing all in the one. Truly an enjoyable stay. Bedroom decor & size met all expectations. Complimentary Bikes was a wonderful way to explore the amazing grounds & facilities that Powerscourt has to offer",5,2022,08,19
217,Best Hotel stay ever,"From the moment we arrived the staff in every area made us feel really well looked after and very welcome. The staff were all very knowledgeable, very informative, extremely down to earth and genuinely nice people. The hotel itself was the best hotel experience we have ever had. The food in McGills bar and the restaurant were both excellent and the staff in both were very informed and accommodating about food allergies (gluten free). The room was the best room that we have ever stopped in and the pool area was a real area of tranquillity to relax in. Overall best hotel stay ever experienced",5,2022,08,18
217,Fabulous hotel,"Fabulous place to stay, just 30 mn from dublin! In a fantastic decor and wonderful surroundings! Staff from the concierge to the receptionist and chamber maids were extremely nice, welcoming and helpful! Rooms were great also, was on the ground floor this time a pity however, still enjoyed it! The breakfast was extremely good and varied, food at sika and mcgills was really delicious and staff very professional. The spa and pool and gym were fab! I have been going there on a regular basis and a yearly treat with my son. We couldn’t recommend enough! Pity there was no acknowledgement of our special occasion despite mentioning at the booking but would definitely come back!",5,2022,08,14
217,Stay 8th August 2022,"Fantastic hotel and grounds we have stayed in this hotel over the last number of years.  The welcome is superb and the staff always excellent, if you are in Ireland and near Dublin stay it's worth the visit",5,2022,08,12
217,Everything you'd want and then some!,"This was one of the nicest stays I've ever had. It was so relaxing and peaceful. Not only from what the Hotel had to offer but also the surrounding amenities, the walks, the gardens, the waterfall etc. The staff were fantastic, so hospitable and the food second to none. The spa was very relaxing and exceptionally well managed, allowing kids times and adult only time. The suite was a wonderful surprise, such luxury, we so enjoyed watching the falconry on the lawn from our balcony. I will definitely be booking again.",5,2022,08,11
217,Outstanding,"I'm a stage 4 cancer patient at 36 so when I go away I really hope the staff, room, amenities etc are calming and stress free. That's EXACTLY when Powerscourt provides PEACE!! Everything was effortless. Wonderful staff. Beautiful big, spacious, clean rooms. Spa was beautiful. Food was great. 2nd time there. We'll be back!! Thank you for a wonderful trip x",5,2022,08,10
217,Fabulous,This was a stunning hotel in every way. The rooms are magnificent with the very best of bed linen and toiletries used. Your every need is anticipated rather than met in this establishment. Breakfast was beautifully cooked and there was a huge selection of everything you could imagine. A real treat.,5,2022,08,10
217,Most amazing venue and Hotel,My Daughter got married in Powerscourt House on July 31st.  We spent 3 nights in Powerscourt Hotel.  The wedding was an experience of a lifetime and such an exquisite setting   From the minute we arrived at the hotel we were made feel welcome  Mossy greeted us and ensured our luggage was taken care of and ensured we were settled into our room.   The staff were fantastic and there was nothing too much for them to provide.  The rooms were luxurious and the views just picturesque.  Probably the best Hotel in Ireland in my opinion.,5,2022,08,08
217,Beautiful resort near Dublin,Beautiful resort outside of Dublin. The staff is extremely friendly and helpful. They fulfill any request you may have. Rooms are very large by European standards with a large bathroom and closet for suitcases. The rooms are extremely quiet. It has some nice high tech lights and curtains that can be controlled from bed. We had a balcony overlooking the mountain that was beautiful. The buffet breakfast had an excellent selection of food with a lot of fresh fruit. We had dinner one night in McGills Pub and the food exceeded our expectations. Wines by the glass were good and reasonably priced. The grounds are impeccable and beautiful. There is a beautiful walk by the river very close by and it’s a short walk into town. Also a give minute walk to Powerscourt Estate with beautiful gardens.,5,2022,08,05
217,Heartbroken child … missing Lovie,"While staying in Room 307 (a family suite) from July 26-29 my some left his beloved comfort blanket in the room.  We know he left it in the room since he had his own bag, it wasn’t opened between Hotel and home, and there were no car stops either… so we know it was left in hotel.  He’s slept with Lovie every night of his life.  He is devastated. Crying himself to sleep every night since.  

I’ve contacted the hotel, and to the credit of Megan on the at your service Desk she contacted housekeeping, but to no avail.  The hotel contacted the linen company but after 5 days still hasn’t heard back.  I’ve personally spoken to the linen company, and they have searched all dirty linen collected from Hotel on Friday and Saturday.  But i had to contact them directly to get an update. 

I’m so very frustrated that a Hotel of this quality and reputation wouldn’t have been more careful checking the room after a family checked out.  

It’s heartbreaking to know that what my child is crying every night for is sat either in the hotel, or linen company, and i can’t do a thing about it.  

I’ve stayed at your hotel dozens of times over the last number of years, but I’m afraid this experience means my family and i are never likely to return to the location my son lost his Lovie.",1,2022,08,03
217,Stunning hotel and friendly staff!,"Myself and my boyfriend stayed here recently and loved every minute of it! We were checked in by Orlagh at reception who was very friendly and welcoming, she was very patient and informative. The cocktails at the Sugarloaf longue were incredible and the view was stunning. The spa & pool facilities are amazing and very clean. The breakfast buffet selection was huge and loved everything! The grounds of the hotel are stunning and incredibly picturesque. All of the staff were very friendly and helpful ☺️ I would say this was the best hotel experience I have ever had and will be back to stay again soon!",5,2022,08,02
217,We didn't want to go home!,"Myself and my partner recently stayed as a little break for ourselves before our first baby is born and it was the perfect break away. Having stayed here a few months ago, we couldn't think of anywhere else we would like to spend a few days relaxing.

I cannot fault the staff who were at all time courteous and polite. Always wanting to go the extra bit to make our stay as pleasant as possible. They made our stay a joy.

My partner raved about the spa and her maternity massage, while I made use of the excellent gym facilities overlooking the stunning front gardens. A dip in the pool together afterwards was perfect.

The food in both the Sika restaurant and McGills pub was lovely with the breakfast amazing. So much so we would have asked for seconds had we not been so nicely full! The Guinness in the bar also couldn't be faulted!

The entire hotel and rooms were impeccably maintained. The rooms were the most comfortable we have ever stayed in and made returning to our own bed difficult.

We will definitely be making more than one trip back in future. We loved it here.",5,2022,08,02
217,Good Hotel.,The hotel is beautiful but It is clearly understaffed especially in the lounge and restaurant. I believe that due to the lack of staff the service was not one of the best because they were always in a hurry and not paying enough attention even though they were friendly.,2,2022,08,01
217,Family Trip July 2022,"The hotel is in a beautiful area with old growth tress and views of Wicklow Mountain. The hotel itself is very nice, and you can tell that little expense was spared in its construction. While the hotel and common areas are very nice, it doesn’t have much in the way of “Irish Charm” -  we could have been at any resort in Europe or the US. The spa and pool were serene and relaxing.  The gym was well outfitted but doesn’t open until 7AM, leaving little time to workout prior to early tours or meetings. The food and beverage options were average at best. The pub doesn’t open until 5PM, so dining options are limited during the day. The adjacent Powerscourt Estate (unaffiliated) has a very good cafe that I wish we had discovered sooner. For some odd reason the hotel doesn’t offer a shuttle service ( or golf cart) to transport you to the various attractions “on the grounds”. The 70+ year olds in our group had a difficult time getting to and from several activities, which led to a poor experience. The only alternative is to call a cab, which can take 20+ minutes to arrive. The nearby Glendalough area is worth a trip for sightseeing and hiking. The grounds and gardens at the adjacent Powerscourt Estate are not to be missed. The room was large, we’ll appointed, and quite comfortable. The service was great, and we particularly liked our bellman (youngish Irish gentleman).  Overall we enjoyed our stay, but preferred the Sheen Falls Lodge and Glenlo Abbey hotels during our recent trip.",4,2022,07,29
217,Excellent Hotel Leisure Break,"We stayed at Powerscourt for a leisure break in July. Beautiful hotel in an idealistic setting. Clean, professional services, well trained and friendly staff. Excellent restaurant on site.  Lots to see and do in the immediate area.",5,2022,07,28
217,Love this place.,"We had a lovely time as usual. The place is beautiful and the staff are very friendly. We just love everything about the hotel. The atmosphere is great, the location/surroundings are perfect and the rooms are top class. 

We have also stayed with our son (3) on a couple of occasions and the place was ideal for him. 

Only minor negative. We would like to see more of a variety when it comes to the food menu. 

We look forward to our next visit.",5,2022,07,26
217,Fabulous hotel,"We have visited Powerscourt Hotel many times and are never disappointed! The setting of the hotel is beautiful and the rooms are spacious and luxurious. The staff are pleasant and helpful. Breakfast is excellent, as is the standard of food and the general ambience n McGills Bar. 
The only negative is that the pillows are ridiculously soft!!",5,2022,07,23
217,Fantastic resort environment to relax,"The building and property are absolutely gorgeous. The dining options, exercise facilities, and rooms are all as advertised. The setting is quiet. The nearby gardens and golf course and hiking are all top notch. We spent time driving through Ireland and finished our trip here. It was the perfect place to relax and we wish we had spent more time here.",5,2022,07,21
217,Evening drinks in Sugar Loaf Lounge,"My family and I went for some evening drinks in the Sugar Loaf Lounge. Lovely atmosphere for a Friday summer evening. The hospitality we received was top quality. Thank you Sarah in the Sugar Loaf Lounge for the engaging and informative conversation, checking in with us regularly and efficient service. Looking forward to our next visit!

217,Lovely stay at a beautiful location,Perfection at Powerscourt . The grounds are lovely and the room is well accommodated. Common areas are beautiful with fresh flowers everywhere.  Sika restaurant is outstanding. Staff is pleasant and helpful no matter the request. Would highly recommend.,5,2022,07,20
217,Simply Superb,"Truly a special hotel. From arrival to leaving ,our stay was delightful.
Lovely spacious room which was spotlessly clean and comfortable. Every staff member we encountered was exemplary - attentive, courteous and friendly. 
It would be impossible to find fault with this hotel.",5,2022,07,19
217,Powerscourt splendor in Wicklow countryside.,"Beautiful hotel, amazing staff, wondrous location. This gorgeous hotel was a welcome respite end to a hectic 12 hour journey from Edinburgh. Short distance from seaside Bray and Dublin proper for food and fun!",5,2022,07,19
217,5 star hotel with 3 star service,"Powerscourt itself is a beautiful hotel. Our room, the pool, gym, and restaurants were all beautiful. The lobby smells delicious and sweet. We also got a complimentary room upgrade upon our arrival and had a lovely staff member help bring our luggage to our room. With that said… we did not get the luxurious customer experience that we were paying for. While we did enjoy our stay, we ran into several hiccups:

1. The room: the AC in our room was ineffective at cooling down the room. We requested a fan, which we received, but even on its highest setting it was barely producing a breeze. Perhaps this wouldn’t have been as much of an issue in cooler months, but it was quite warm in our room which made sleeping a bit uncomfortable.

2. The bathroom: The bathroom was beautiful and the complimentary soaps all smelled lovely, but our shower wasn’t draining properly. We requested assistance with this so that we could shower, but the reception desk was having a hard time understanding our issue and tried to tell us engineering had gone home for the day and couldn’t help. After explaining for a while that the drain needed to be snaked and it wasn’t an engineering issue, we got lucky and someone finally arrived to our room to help.

3. Room service: We had asked for ice to be delivered to the room several times, and we ended up having to get it ourselves because it never came after following up several times with the staff. We also had ordered some chocolate covered strawberries to be delivered to the room in advance prior to our arrival and they were not there when we arrived, so we had to ask again. This ruined my surprise for my girlfriend and we still paid the same price for it.

4. The hot tub: the hot tub was lovely in design, but the water was not exactly hot, but slightly warmer than the pool.

5. Afternoon tea: we pre-booked afternoon tea several days in advance, and while the tea was delicious and the treat towers were wonderful, my girlfriend is a vegetarian, and they told us upon arrival that they needed 24 hour notice to provide us with a vegetarian meal because we needed to alert them to any dietary restrictions. While this is understandable to an extent, the main menu for afternoon tea includes both vegetarian and vegan afternoon tea options. We found this to be confusing as to why they would put it on the regular menu if it wouldn’t be available without special requesting 24 hours ahead of time. They did try to rectify the situation by bringing us ice cream, but to be honest, for the price we were paying for our tea without a complete vegetarian afternoon tea option, I think we should have been offered a discounted price for the vegetarian meal that was provided.

I would definitely give Powerscourt a second chance, but there were definitely a few issues that needed addressing.",3,2022,07,19
217,Simply Superb,"Simply superb. Very comfortable room. Spacious and  everywhere was spotlessly clean.
Attentive, kind and courteous staff. Each member of staff we encountered was friendly and helpful. Nothing was too much trouble.
I would highly recommend this excellent hotel.",5,2022,07,17
217,This hotel has really lifted its service levels!,"We have stayed here many times and have always loved the location, the rooms and the Pool, gym and Spa facilities. However the service and food has often been left wanting!
What a pleasant surprise to discover vastly improved levels of service. Food wise we only had a breakfast which was fine as was the pub dinner and we ate out the other nights so I can’t comment on the restaurant food",5,2022,07,12
217,Outstanding,"We booked last Friday as a couple to simply ""recharge the batteries"", from a hectic work schedule. I arrived for my Spa treatment and Karen looked after me. Karen is an excellent therapist and it was one of the best massage/facials that I have ever had. The Spa is lovely with a relaxing area overlooking the beautiful views that the hotel has to offer. We had dinner which was delicious and a good choice of wines and whiskeys on the menu. 
Our bedroom was pure luxury and spotless. If you need an excellent night's sleep you are certain to have one in these beds! we woke reinvigorated! 
We had a nice walk around the grounds after a delicious breakfast, I'm vegetarian and the veggie option was very tasty. Nermina, the breakfast host was most pleasant and attentive. Everything was flawless and we can't wait to return. Yes, it can be a little expensive but worth every bit as you won't be disappointed! Thank you to Peter the operations manager, and all the team for an outstanding stay.",5,2022,07,11
217,Beautiful,"On our trip to Ireland, we stayed at another hotel which was more expensive and a few which were average priced. Powerscourt certainly provided the best value. Everything was beautiful. We enjoyed live music on Friday night and I was happy to use one of the bicycles in the morning.",5,2022,07,11
217,Amazing stay,"Amazing time spent here. We went for two days and everything from start to finish was out of this world. We ended up getting an amazing room with a balcony facing the back views. The food was amazing in Sika & McGills. All the staff were so friendly, professional and couldn’t do enough for us. I’m lactose intolerant and they were so accommodating in offering substitutes. The spa was so clean and relaxing. We’ll definitely be back here again.",5,2022,07,07
217,"Beautiful setting, relaxed and Friendly","Beautiful setting, surrounded by woodland and Sugarloaf mountain, the grounds are well maintained and if looking for some peace and quiet, it's perfect.
Breakfast was incredible, fry, fruit, breads, cereals, pastries and an a la carte menu, plenty to choose from.
Dinner in the Sika restaurant was melt in your mouth, nice portion sizes and a lovely relaxed ambience.  They kindly sent out a Birthday plate with a few extra desserts on display.
Our rooms were spotless, modern but warm and with character, beds very comfortable, I usually suffer with back pain, but I slept soundly! The view was also beautiful, and again, quiet, no noise from within or outside the hotel.
Spa treatments were lovely, staff incredibly polite, friendly and professional, we were given a sorbet after our treatment, which was a lovely touch. Swimming pool is large and was never too busy.  I felt the thermal suite was quite small for the size of the hotel.
Staff throughout the hotel were genuinely friendly, relaxed and accommodating. 
Overall I only wish that we had stayed 2 nights in order to take in the waterfall and the surroundings, will know better for the next time 🤞",5,2022,07,06
217,Incredible Weekend,"I've just returned from a weekend stay for my mother's birthday and I have to say it was just the most incredible experience. The hotel itself is stunning and you get the luxury experience before you even step through the door with the friendly staff on hand to help with luggage. Check in was seamless and the receptionist was such a breath of fresh air. Our room was stunning and the views from the balcony really elevate the whole experience. Wicklow truly has some of the most beautiful scenery! The pre-dinner cocktail in the Sugar Loaf lounge was so serene and the cocktail insanely tasty. However, the highlight of my stay was the Sika restaurant. The young girl who served us was so friendly and attentive as was the management who were very present and checked in with us regularly. The food was also out of this world and I must thank the team for the lovely birthday plate for my mother. We enjoyed every aspect of this trip and look forward to returning as soon as possible!",5,2022,07,06
217,Special weekend away,"This was my first time to go to a high end hotel, just for the hotel and experience and wow! Powerscourt, when combined with the Gardens & the village of Enniskerry is truly a very special and unique experience.",5,2022,07,06
217,5 Star Treat!,Stayed here for a significant birthday. Upgraded upon arrival which was a very nice touch. The entire site is impressive but also has a welcome feel and is beautifully maintained and extremely clean. Ate in Sika on the first night and in McGills on the second night -both meals were first class! The breakfast was also a ten out of ten. The surrounding grounds are also a real plus here - it makes you want to return and we certainly intend to do so!!  p.s. the birthday card and chocolate treat left to the room sealed the deal :-),5,2022,07,05
217,Superb stay,We came and stayed a week at Powerscourt Hotel and had a superb time. Suite was beautiful with the most wonderful view of Big Sugarloaf!  Staff were very attentive and food was excellent. We will be back,5,2022,07,05
217,This is what 5 star is suppose to be!,"This was the 2nd time that my wife & I stayed her and truth be told it was even better than the first. The welcome, the amazing room upgrade, the superb customer service and delicious food made my wife's birthday one to remember. We'll absolutely be returning for another stay at this fabulous hotel.",5,2022,07,05
217,Words cannot describe,"This is my second visit to powerscourt - booked the espa spa retreat - so reasonable considering the spa is out of this world and includes dinner . Definitely visit the whiskey distillery and order the picnic (once again the price does not reflect the quality of the food I was shocked by the quantity and quality ) the gardens are fabulous to walk around in. We had cocktails before dinner which were beautiful , dinner out of this world . The whole vibe of powerscourt is special ! The spa needs a massive mention , had a full body massage and after relaxed in the relaxation suite overlooking the mountains and then enjoyed all the thermal suite . I cannot fault the hotel in any way from location to staff to the rooms and facilities simply outstanding",5,2022,07,03
217,5star All The Way,"Have stayed on several occasions over the years and have always found all staff so friendly and welcoming. Powerscourt is 5 star in every aspect but always made to feel you belong ! The Spa is so relaxing ! Breakfast is always delicious 
Hope to visit again soon 
Excellent",5,2022,07,03
217,One of the Best in the World!,"We've traveled a bit but this hotel was among the very best--accommodations were top notch, the staff was friendly and helpful, the location was stunning and the food/drink was great.  Went for business but the family joined and had a blast.  The gardens are among the best in the world, river walk was fun and the town of Enniskary was just as you'd expect a quaint Irish village to be.",5,2022,07,02
217,10/10,"This place is fantastic. The rooms are charming and clean. Loved the vibe, the service and the dining. We will definitely be back here! The gardens are a must see!!! It’s close enough to Dublin but also the town is cute. The pub downstairs is also worth a visit",5,2022,06,28
217,Back to the much deserved 5 star rating!,"We have been here many, many times and this experience NOW equals or surpasses the experience when, years ago, it was a Ritz Carlton.  We booked our favorite room and it was beautifully cleaned and refreshed.  Fabulous breakfasts and we love the return of linen napkins!  New bikes to enjoy the bike ride around the river.  Of course the Powerscourt Gardens are  inspirational and so beautifully maintained.  The rose garden is fabulous…many thanks to all of the wonderful staff…we will return once again.",5,2022,06,28
217,In need of maintence,"While the breakfast was nice and the hotel very clean it was clear that the maintenance checks were cursory.  The air-conditioning was not working and the room very airless.  The toilet started to run (at midnight) which was noisy and also unusable.  Only some of the electrical outlets worked - I assume that the outlets and the a/c were on the same ring.  

Also avoid Room 557 - no view to speak of (unless you count a wall) 

I also thought that the front desk staff were a little more than hopeless in dealing with these issues",2,2022,06,26
217,Powerscourt is worth its 5 stars!,Absolutely wonderful! The rooms and spa were spectacular and exceptionally clean. The staff were so lovely and accommodating. Breakfast had a great selection and was delicious. The atmosphere throughout was relaxed and set on a such a stunning backdrop. Definitely worthy of all 5 stars!,5,2022,06,24
217,Decent Break from Dublin Hotels,"The Powers Court was overall very lovely and a great stay. The staff is very nice and helpful and seemed to really like working there. They acknowledged our Marriott Titanium status and explained the Benefits. They also sent a bottle of champagne to the room to celebrate our birthdays which was very nice. 

The hotel property is decent but could use a little bit of updating and maintenance. It was still very comfortable and nice to stay at. 

We stayed in one of their largest spacious sweets which is very well pointed and had a separate kitchen living room office area bedroom and even its own sauna. You really see saunas in a room so it was a very nice extra. The room could use a little bit of maintenance but it was overall very nice and comfortable.

The main restaurant for breakfast was very nice and had a lot of options and for dinner it was a set menu which is pretty decent. The pub restaurant was OK but not fantastic. Teatime in the main lounge was pretty forgettable and I wouldn't do it again.

The spa and gym facility is we're much larger than I anticipated and we're very nice. The large pool was also a big surprise for a hotel like that. The gym was nice and big and had lots of options.

Overall this hotel is pretty good to stay at for a change of pace in Dublin and being next to the Powerscourt Castle it was also fun to check out. The staff and the property made the stay, and I would probably stay there again.",4,2022,06,23
217,Great stay at Powerscourt,"We stayed here June 17 to 20, and echo most of the other reviews here. We're Bonvoy platinum elite and chose the free breakfast over the 1,000 extra points per night. Fantastic as we could choose anything from the dining room menu or buffet each morning. If you order to your room, it's free again, but with a 6 euro delivery charge. Our 4 suite night awards were honored with an upgrade to a fantastic one bedroom suite, likely due to the fact that the hotel needed the cheaper rooms for weddings that weekend. 

This is a stunning property, with great staff, exceptional food, and immaculate grounds. Lots of walks in the nearby gardens and town. Would love to return to play the golf course, which is first rate. All of this is within walking distance.

Didn't use the spa, but the gym looked well equipped and with a nice view outside.

It's one of the best hotels we've ever stayed in. A very solid 5 star experience.",5,2022,06,20
217,ELane,"Had a great stay in Powerscourt Hotel. Fantastic hotel and impeccable service. I couldn’t fault it from start to finish. Nothing was a issue. Staff were very accommodating, friendly and approachable, will be back again.",5,2022,06,17
217,Amazing as always,"Returned to Powerscourt this week for a 2 night family stay. As always the hotel and grounds are beautifully maintained and spotlessly clean. Dined in Sika, Mcgills and also availed of in room dining, food was delicious, service was second to none and staff couldn’t do enough for us. Looking forward to returning soon. Thank you team Powerscourt 5 star as always",5,2022,06,16
217,Stunning!,"Beautiful hotel on gorgeous grounds. We got early check in and a BEAUTIFUL big room with large bathroom, separate closet room, huge bed and big balcony sitting area with the best views ever. Felt relaxed the second we arrived until the second we left. Impeccable service and food in Sikka restaurant. Stunning hotel!!!",5,2022,06,16
217,Really excellent and amazing,"Finishing up a two night stay now at the end of a week in Ireland.  A wonderfully grand hotel.  The rooms are phenomenal and large. The bathroom is amazing. My wife and I had dinner at Sika (3 course fixed price).  It is expensive but we’ll worth a special occasion. Afternoon tea today was lovely and much more food and tea than we expected.  The staff has been very helpful, and knowledgeable and the grounds are lovely.",5,2022,06,14
217,Nice spaces,"The grounds, lobby, and rooms of this hotel are lovely. The staff are really friendly but a little extra effort in terms of guest knowledge wouldn't go astray. We told multiple staff members why we were staying but nobody made a note of it. On our first morning the, very friendly, room service attendant asked if we were checking out. We were not. It wasn't a problem, but would have made the experience extra special if they knew that this was a special occasion for us",4,2022,06,13
217,Great stay,"Stayed here recently with a friend and I can't recommend it more. Thank you to lovely staff. Idealic location with lot's to do in local area. Food was top notch and so was spa, definitely coming back!!",5,2022,06,13
217,Spa Day,"I can only comment on a full day in the Spa, not an overnight stay. 
Beautifully located in the Powerscourt Estate, the hotel enjoys a tranquil position. Walk through the grand entrance to the spa, located downstairs. Elegant and stylish with a Swarovski swimming pool, reception area and restaurant on one level and treatment rooms, relaxation room and spa on  the upper level. Staff here is friendly and polite and the treatments we chose were lovely. Massages, neck, head, legs and feet.
Lunch was part of the package. Tasty and fresh, soup and salad and an assortment of sandwiches and pastries afterwards. Nearly too much food.
My only critique is that the downstairs jacuzzi could be a tad warmer and the upstairs whirlpool in the ladies section a lot warmer. This one was cold!! Not what you want in a spa!
You will find plenty of towls in the change rooms, lockers and bathrobes plus slippers are provided.  You will also have access to showers, hairdryer etc.. 
Relaxing !",4,2022,06,06
217,Pure Excellence,"As very frequent “hotel travellers” we have never stayed here before. Upon arrival we noted the very tidy, well maintained site, substantial car park with adequate electric car charging and room parking spaces surrounded by nice topiary and planting. Immediate invitation to help with luggage and information, rapid check in and room facilities demonstration. Very high level of tasteful decor throughout and a general plush feeling without making one feel out of place. Food facilities and standard are impeccable. Higher end cost but clearly worth the experience. All staff encountered had a high level of knowledge and obviously very well trained in cohesion and customer service. Definitely one to return to",5,2022,06,02
217,POWERSCOURT 5* RESORT,"As an ex travel consultant I have been privileged to stay in many beautiful 5* properties around the world. I can honestly say that Powerscourt Resort in Enniskerry Co Wicklow is one of my favourites which I am drawn back to time and time again.

From the minute you arrive you always receive a friendly warm welcome from the porter to the reception staff. The hotel foyer,rooms,dining areas,spa,bathrooms  and garden areas are always impeccable and of true 5 * standard.

I would recommend anybody considering to stay in this hotel to do so without hesitation. TS",5,2022,06,01
217,Best hotel with the best service,"This is my second time to stay at The Powerscourt Hotel and I have to say it is my favourite hotel in Ireland. You are treated so well from the moment you step in the door and each member of staff you meet along the way can’t help you enough. Myself and my partner dined in Sika restaurant and the food and service was fabulous! To top it off, the General Manger Eamon Casey came over and introduced himself and asked if there was anything he do to make our stay more enjoyable. This was a really nice touch. We went to McGills bar afterwards and the live music and cocktails were great. We will definitely be back soon!",5,2022,06,01
217,5 star hotel but 3 star service,"The hotel and grounds themselves are beautiful there is no denying that however the service is below par and not that of a 5-star standard.

We booked a classic double suite for €630. The room itself was spacious, well furnished and the beds were comfortable, however there was no cable television, no on demand movies to purchase and the chromecast feature was not working. We found this most unsual as most hotels have this option included in their rooms.

There was also no bottle opener in the room or kettle, we had to contact concerige twice to bring the bottle opener to the room & it took them a very long time to deliver it.

We dined in the Sika restaurant for lunch and the food was delicious, however we had wings and there was no water bowls supplied with our dish so that we could clean our hands. We also ordered two cocktails, a margarita and a whiskey sour. The margarita wasn't made properly and the whiskey sour never arrived at all, the waiter brought out a whiskey on the rocks and despite sending it back for being the wrong drink, the same waiter tried to give it to us again, so I would not advise ordering cocktails.

McGills pub is also far too small for the number of guests staying on the premises, before checking in we had asked whether we could book a table in the bar as the match was on and we didn't want to miss it. We were told this was not possible but we should have no problem walking in to the bar and getting a table.  When I went down to the bar at 7pm  I was told there were no tables and they had a big waiting list, so we couldn't even have a drink in the bar? The in room dining was also great, and the selection was poor.  We had asked whether it was possible to order from the bar menu but again this was not possible.

Upon departure we had asked whether it would be OK to check out at a 1pm instead of 12pm due to otu flight being delayed but we were told no this was not possible, even though we were willng to pay more. The check in time to the hotel is 4pm so, it wasn't like we were cutting it short for the next arrival.

No one assisted us in carrying our bags from the room to the car, the service was not offered to us after we paid our outstanding bill.

I would love to recommend this place to friends and family as I had heard great things, but we had a very underwhelming stay and for the price we paid do not feel like it was worth it.",3,2022,05,29
217,"A most outstanding and perfect hotel set in breathtaking scenic surroundings,  a truly five star experience",This is a perfect peaceful location set in the fantastic Powerscourt Estate with memorable views and excellent facilities and first class attentive staff and wonderful dining. My first choice for business or leisure with easy access to Dublin all routes and the airport.,5,2022,05,28
217,Simply Amazing hotel just outside Dublin.,"A simply amazing stay. 

Wow what a hotel! From the start right until the end it was such an amazing experience from the hugely welcoming staff.

The whole hotel is just awesome from the incredible lobby and the simply outstanding 5 star rooms and all its little touches. 

Our first stay was at the amazing Westin in Dublin but we wanted a much more idyllic stay so we choose the Powerscourt and im so glad we did. 

I have to say that the best part of all was the stunning views of the countryside and the beauty of this hotel and its grounds. 

Just wow.",5,2022,05,25
217,Disappointed,"Five star luxury hotel with 3 star service. On our previous visits to Ireland we have stayed in a city centre luxury hotel. It was always wonderful. Powerscourt tries but fails to deliver. We changed rooms twice because the first room had no opening windows and no where to sit. Breakfast so disappointing with overcooked eggs in a buffet, etc. Dinner in the Sika was excellent, however I had asked for a dessert and candle for my sons birthday. They forgot. Overall and sadly disappointing because the setting and the golf courses are stunning.",3,2022,05,25
217,"An amazing Hotel , location and Staff","We spent 3 days at Powerscourt recently with some very good friends.

Our friends had stayed at Powerscourt before, but this was our first visit.

From the warm welcome at Dublin airport by the resident DriverEamonn through to every member of staff we could not have felt more welcome and part of the great atmosphere of Powerscourt.

During our stay we had 3 hearty and delicious breakfasts from a wonderful choice of first class products, we ate dinner at Sika , a super experience , we used the Spa for great massages and could not have had a better overall experience.

 The grounds and gardens are truly wonderful and with golf, wonderful walks and great places to visit this is World Class.

We are definitely coming back, as are our friends, and for discerning travellers I can safely say there is nowhere better,",5,2022,05,17
217,What a place!,"What a place!
Been there a few times now exploring the estate. Fantastic location, and what a scenery. Everything you'll be looking for get a break from the everyday stress.
Been playing golf there as well, very nice courses.
I'll be back!!!",5,2022,05,16
217,Enjoyable stay in a lovely estate,"My wife and I spent three nights here. It was in a great location - we enjoy garden visits and Mount Usher, Kilmacurragh, and Powerscourt Gardfens themselves were all quite near, as was Glendalough. 

The hotel is large and modern. Our room was lovely and spacious, with a balcony, and overlooked the gardens. It was very quiet. The quilt was too warm for us (air conditioning would not set below 21 degrees) but housekeeping changed it straight away for a lighter one, which was much better. The lighting in the bathroom was good, except that there wasn’t anywhere really suitable for a woman to do her make-up. We didn’t use the spa facilities. 

Breakfast was first rate, but evening meals didn’t work out so well for us. We ate twice in the pub: the food was ok but unexceptional. We looked at the menu for the Sika Restaurant and weren’t sure we fancied the menu, so didn’t eat in it. Car parking was great and close to the entrance. 

The lovely Powerscourt House and Gardens were about 10 minutes away. 

We were lucky to have good weather during our stay, which made it even more enjoyable.",4,2022,05,14
217,Top quality hotel in a wonderful location,"From arrival to departure everything was a great experience. Quick check in with our cases brought up to the room and a full explanation of the rooms facilities given. We had the extra large room with a balcony and it had a fridge, coffee machine, bath and walk in shower and sitting area. Breakfast was a full buffet to suit all tastes. We had dinner in the main restaurant and it exceeded expectations with the attentive staff, variety of choice and the lovely unique flavours of the dishes.",5,2022,05,14
217,Mrs,"Definitely not a sound proof hotel and should not be advertising as one, we booked a suite on the sane floor as reception for our 5th wedding anniversary. We were woken early the 1st morning to the noise of a tv and hairdryer upstairs.on our second night we were woken at 2am to shalll we say a (couple having a good time and very vocal) this went on for some time, i understand people go away to hotels for a relaxing romantic time but this was absolutely disturbing. Looking back now we should have rang reception but we were mortified and embarrassed, my husband did talk to the manager later, and were told we would be looked after personally by him on return, which i dont think was satisfactory as a 2 night stay in a suite is over €1000 which i later learnt, as my husband had booked it. Restaurant menu poor, bar food very good. Breakfast lovely. Scenery beautiful.",1,2022,05,11
217,"Beautiful Hotel, Amazing Stay","We were in for a wedding and couldn't have enjoyed our stay more. We arrived early after an overnight flight and they were so accommodating in getting our room ready as soon as possible. The spa was delightful, the breakfast delicious, the grounds pristine. The room service was just as delicious as the main restaurant. We wish we had more time to explore but hope to visit again in the future.",5,2022,05,10
217,Wonderful stay,"We had a very good stay here ,

Great staff (extremely helpful and very accommodating) 
Great breakfast (a wide variety of cooked and cold meats ,salmon, cheeses and compotes. very fresh ,the Staff and service for breakfast was exceptional, no waiting and extremely organised.
A  special mention to the lady with the top hat 🎩 who arranged water without even asking after our bike ride this was very well received and very thoughtful , your hotel is fortunate to have someone like this that goes the extra mile , 

The only down side to our stay was the noisey air conditioning in our room ,the room itself was beautiful, 

The spa was excellent and my husband had a Swedish massage again the staff where very friendly and helpful, the steam room and sauna and pool was kept to a very high standard , very clean and lovely fluffy towels ,

We had dinner at Magills  on our first night again very accommodating but we did have to wait an hour ,but again the girl was lovely and called us on our phone when the table was ready we had a drink upstairs with complimentary nibbles which was a nice touch . 

The location is breathtaking, the kids went horse riding near the sugarloaf ,our bike with the complimentary bikes was great fun Especially going down the hill coming back up was a different story but we had a nice relaxing afternoon in the spa followed by dinner ,

It would have been 5⭐️If the A/C didn’t keep me awake .",4,2022,04,26
217,Weekend stay,"Myself and my husband stayed at Powerscourt (supposidly) 5 star hotel in early April.   Our children gifted us a voucher for our 30th wedding anniversary.  we were also gifted from them an afternoon in same hotel. The afternoon tea was literally the only good thing about our whole weekend that was worth talking about. I would give you my thoughts on our stay

We arrived on Friday late afternoon for afternoon tea,  then proceeded to our room.  on arrival we noted that the room was literally freezing,  we put on our coats, and proceeded to unpack our bags,  but thought,  this cant be right.  My husband pressed down for assistance,  eventually one of your worker's arrived.  He recognised,  yes,  the air conditioning was bellowing in very cold air.   He set it to 29* and we went downstairs to the front foyer for a drink.  We eventually went upstairs as I was tired and really wanted to run a bath. 

We arrived back to our room to discover the air conditioning had continued to bellow out very cold air.  I was kind of feeling annoyed at this stage,  we were celebrating our 30 wedding anniversary and my 60th birthday and we really did not need to be messed around.  At this stage I went downstairs to reception,  met the manager in charge,  who suggested we move to another room,  I asked could I see the room first,  she said yes of course.  So I messaged my husband to pack up our bags,  I went to see the room and was very very disappointed,  it was half the size of the original room,  and it did not feel special at all.  So I messaged my husband and said I really did not like the room,  he said just come back to the original room we would unpack and leave our coats on.  The Lady at the reception insisted we went to another room,   I went back to my room and waited,  it was getting quite Late at this stage,  all I wanted was a bath and my bed,  not what I wanted on my first night.  So we waited and waited and waited in our very cold room for word about the New room,  eventually I got fed up waiting and phoned down to reception.  the manager on duty duly apologized but was shocked we were not at the New room,  she said she would look for the lad who was to bring us to the New room,  she eventually phoned back and said,  sorry again and he was on his way. 

He arrived to show us to the New room,  apologized for the delay,  but he had gone to the New room and put the temperature up to 29 to have room warmer for when we arrived there.  We arrived to the room to the thermostat up to 29 but still cold,  it continued to blow out very cold air,  the young lad again apologized he couldnt understand why it was doing that.  My husband turned the whole thing off so the room would heat up and said,  we are not moving again. 

It was now after 10pm and I had no desire for a bath then,  bitterly disappointed.  None of this was what I expected of a 5 star hotel, certainly not what we paid for. 

We were sent up 3 tiny Cherry biscuits as an apology for all the disruption.   When I asked for a card to complete to give my views,  I was amazed they dont do same,  
The food in the restaurant,  was literally,  just alright! . When we said it was freezing,  she apologized,  and that was it$ We never ever complain,  have stayed in many many 5 star Hotels,  and have never stayed in one like this.  

I genuinely feel one night of my two night stay was destroyed by all the carry on.  

I was offered another nights accommodation to compensate for our woeful stay,  I asked was dinner included,  but told no,  just B&B,  after my children spending so much money on this gift,  I would not see the poínt in staying in the hotel for another night without having the meal included. I was not willing to pay another cent to the hotel.
Totally gutted at the whole experience,  gutted!",2,2022,04,18
217,"90 mins to check in, they lost our reservation,  blamed us and then tried to over charge us","We waited an hour and a half to check in, they lost our reservation,  tried to blame us, then tried to over charge us, while our 3 poor tired hungry children were waiting,  terrible experience,  really disgraceful, no decent apology..........",1,2022,04,16
217,Tranquil Stay,"Whilst back in Dublin we visited this hotel for a brief escape from the city. It is a short drive, about 50 mins from the city. It was a lovely experience from start to finish. Staff on the front desk were friendly and very helpful; rooms are extremely large and comfortable with beautiful views; all good we had was lovely and there are so many beautiful walks nearby. 

There were a few little things that could be improved - the TVs in the bathrooms did not work; the hairdryer lead is so short that we ended up sitting on the floor to use it; we ordered items using the app which didn’t arrive until the next day (no longer needed)  and one of the rooms had lovely fluffy robes but the other room didn’t which was a shame. None of this upset the stay at all, just minor improvements. 

Overall a lovely stay and would be very happy to stay again.",5,2022,04,14
217,Luxury Stay,Stayed here with my sister for a treat in February. We had such a lovely time. The leisure centre is second to none particularly the steam room. The breakfast was 10/10. Staff extremely pleasant. The pub within the hotel is a great amenity and the cocktails are a must try. Looking forward to return visit.,5,2022,04,11
217,Amazing weekend break!,"My boyfriend and myself stayed  for 2 nights and it was absolutely amazing. From the grounds to the helpful staff everything was perfect. The staff were a pleasure to deal with and the service was definitely 5 star, can’t wait to come back again!",5,2022,04,10
217,Very disappointing,"Currently writing this at 4am in the room I’m staying in, although it’s something I wouldn’t normally do at this stage I’m so annoyed about my experience here it’s been anything but relaxing 

Firstly we used the pool and spa we tried days before hard to book the spa and no one answered or called us back it was then too late to book anything as they had no availability so we opted to use the pool and jacuzzi the jacuzzi was only half working and in my opinion the water was very cold! It was far from relaxing and we didn’t bother staying as the pool was even colder. 

We then retreated back to the room, there is parts of the wall paper peeling which I wouldn’t be one to complain but I feel begins to add to all the other issues!  I was hoping for a relaxing bath to sit off and watch tv in the bathroom when I had to call reception due to not being able to turn on the TV I was told “oh if there is no remote the tv isn’t working sorry” I felt that even if I was told
This at the beginning it would be understandable but it was very disappointing response and no effort was made to make up for this. 

Using the phone was impossible the line was crackled and unclear it took 20 min for what I ordered was a glass of Prosecco and he brought 2. Again whatever could of gotten over it. 

We had dinner in the restaurant and I had to wait 10 minutes for someone’s attention to get a spoon to eat my soup starter.  On paying the bill was incorrect and they were over charging us by over 100 euro! 

We had to go looking for any kind of service, even to order a drink it all was very much the opposite of effortless in which you would expect in a 5 star hotel stay. 

We have then had the worst sleep due to the heat in the room and being unable to reduce the thermostat to
Under 21 degrees. The air con seems to be only blowing out warm air, 
We were dropped up 2 small fans as a result and had to turn the air con off.
The hotel staff were all polite but I feel lack enthusiasm or genuine concern its very obvious that they were apologetic because they have to be not because they actually care.

This is all far from the taste and quality you would expect at such a hotel and so disappointing as it was meant to be a night spent with my sister to relax before I head back to Australia. Honestly so disappointing. I don’t think I’ll ever be back.",2,2022,04,04
217,"Luxurious stay, fantastic experience made special by wonderful staff","My wife and I have just returned from a fantastic weekend stay at the Powerscourt hotel & spa. I booked this break as a surprise for my wife’s 40th birthday. Upon check-in we were greeted by friendly staff who provided us with a complimentary upgrade to a very spacious mountain view room which overlooked the main gardens and water fountain. 

The overall experience and facilities in the hotel are superb including the rooms, restaurant, bar, swimming pool and spa. Thanks to David in concierge, we took the opportunity to make use of the complimentary bike hire and cycled around the estate grounds and along the river walk (steep hill going down to river walk) which was a wonderful experience. 

The Sika restaurant manager, John, his team and chef made our stay that extra bit special. Upon my special request, John and the hotel chef sourced fresh seafood, including monk fish, mussels and caviar, for our final nights meal which was exceptional. Many thanks again John.

Overall this is a luxurious and fantastic hotel, set in outstanding surroundings made special and personal by such wonderful staff. We will definitely be returning to the hotel again.",5,2022,04,03
217,Bad bad absolute nite mare,On arrival your treated to the full 5* treatment it’s all downhill from here the food is below average the drink is bad I mean BAD the beer is to warm .. and when pointed it out to the bar staff they seemed oblivious to the problem I will never stay here again and will advise all my friends likewise,2,2022,04,01
217,Peaceful and relaxing stay in luxury hotel in Powerscourt estate,"Having stayed at Powerscourt somewhere between 6, 8 or maybe even more times over the years, it is about time for me to write a review. However this shows that I love the hotel enough to come back more than once. For me it is the setting that makes it. 
Powerscourt truly is a luxurious and glamorous hotel with some of the internal luxury dating back to when it was a Ritz but it pulls it off easily. From the entrance and seating by the fire, to the sugar loaf lounge, it is a very rich but welcoming hotel with Irish hospitality on display from the outset. 
The rooms are always huge, beds comfy, baths and rain showers are all great and with the living areas in the suites, they are huge. I’ve stayed in various parts of the hotel but for me the top floor and 2nd floors, both with outside terraces to sit outside, are real highlights.
My trip this week allowed me to enjoy the afternoon tea overlooking sugar loaf which was a highlight. It was quiet so I was well looked after by the team and was really enjoyable experience. Hiked up Great Sugar Loaf afterwards to walk it off the teas. My experience was completely different to those recent comparison of afternoon tea so I recommend giving it a go. Pictures attached of the afternoon tea and then of sugar loaf up close. (Although it is a steep hike)
The Silka restaurant does a great breakfast with wide range of offerings as mentioned in other reviews. The evening meals at Silka are good food however a little pricey for the mixed price menu. I’ve never tried the pub menu. 
The concierge crew are extremely knowledgeable so take time to ask them about places to go in the wider area beyond what they typically offer the visitor as there is a lot to explore in the area.
Check out the river walk if you get the chance to explore the estate.",5,2022,03,25
217,Didn’t want to leave!,We really enjoyed our stay at this beautiful hotel. We found the staff from checking in to the staff in the bar and restaurant extremely professional and friendly. The room was beautiful and very spacious.  We also spent time in the stunning spa and pool which I would highly recommend. Everything was of the highest standard.,5,2022,03,24
217,Magical stay we will be back !,"Fab food and hotel facilities.. We ate dinner in Sika and it was the best meal I've had in years. Breakfast was top notch too, a huge range of options from hot to cold as part of the buffet breakfast in the Sika restaurant with amazing views of Sugarloaf. Stayed for my wife's birthday and received complimentary upgrade to a suite, chocolates and happy birthday dessert plate. Lovely grounds that  are large  to walk around, with a nice playground, picnic tables and a fountain. Kids enjoyed pool and river walk a short walk from the hotel. Only draw back was queueing to check in and check out. A majical special stay , we will definitely be returning !!!",5,2022,03,20
217,"Wonderful stay, impressive hotel","Myself and my daughter stayed for two nights in March. From start to finish the experience was wonderful. There is an option to check in online, making it very quick when you arrive at the hotel. The reception staff were very friendly and helpful, assisting with booking swim times and breakfast, and a member of staff brought our bags up to our room and demonstrated how to use the amenities in the room. The room itself was very luxurious and spacious, the bed was large and very comfortable. Unfortunately the smart features of the TV were not working but, as we had our tablet with us, this wasn’t a big issue. The hotel is spotless, elegant and impressive. The pool is large and the additional hot pool was very relaxing. The water temperature in the pool is a little on the cold side, but once you stay active in the pool it’s ok. Be sure to book family swim times as there are restrictions still in place. Breakfast was amazing, a huge range of options from hot to cold as part of the buffet breakfast in the Sika restaurant with amazing views of Sugarloaf. The grounds are large and lovely to walk around, with a nice little playground, picnic tables and a fountain. Powerscourt House and Gardens is adjacent, a short walk from the hotel. All in all, a wonderful stay and we will definitely be returning !!!",5,2022,03,20
217,"Relaxing, just what we needed!","We had the most lovely stay in Powerscourt over the weekend. While the hotel was busy, check in was quick and easy, the young man who assisted us was extremely helpful. 
We then had a few drinks in the sugarloaf lounge which was the highlight of our stay. Although extremely busy the staff worked extremely quick and efficiently and looked after us well. The young manager Niamh was absolutely fantastic, able to suggest which cocktails we may like and just brought an overall happy & positive aspect to our experience, extremely chirpy and happy to help! 
Dinner in sika was again lovely, I believe we had a new young lady serving us but she did a great job for a busy Saturday night! 
Extremely comfortable bed, a great night sleep which we were both in need for and have come away feeling well rested and refreshed. 
All round great staff, great food and drinks and will definitely return in the future.",4,2022,03,06
217,Glorious stay in idyllic location,"Thoroughly enjoyed this hotel, extremely comfortable beds, and delicious food. The reason I didn’t give it a 5/5 was because the hotel was overheated. Thermostat was set to a minimum of 21 degrees, and could not be switched off. We asked in reception but were told nothing could be done. This affected our quality of sleep (woke several times a night, absolutely roasting), and bothered us as it was a tremendous waste of heating energy. Understand some guests like heated bedrooms but feel we should all have the option to reduce the temperature.",4,2022,03,06
217,Afternoon tea: excellent food and presentation. Poor service,"Went for afternoon tea with my mother, sister and one year old for a celebration. When we arrived they brought us to a table with only two settings and said they'd go get the remainder which was fine and they did so. However, when we were seated the lady who seemed like a floor manager or such came back and rudely said that the reason the places were not set was because it was booked for two. It had always been booked for three and a baby, they had been great on the phone when I booked taking the information regarding the high seat and everything, and when I said that I could show her the booking on my phone she refused. They also then laid out the table settings poorly so my back was to the Sugarloaf, one of very few people in such a position as it is certainly the stand out feature and I felt my daughter was positioned in a thoroughfare.
We then noticed that my daughter was literally rocking side to side in her baby seat as the screws were falling out of it. Having already been greeted with an unfriendly welcome we just took her out and fixed the screws ourselves by hand but we had to keep a close eye on them. I rang them after to let them know as I would be terrified the screws would come loose when another baby was in it. Her baby seat, which had no table attached, also had jam all down the side so obviously had never been cleaned or sanitised after the last baby was in it. While I know we are coming out of Covid, fingers crossed, this did make me feel uncomfortable.
Staff in general seemed frustrated, brought wrong drink orders, extra orders not ordered, lack of communication, rushed. That said some other staff were lovely and very friendly and accommodating.
We went to use the loo before leaving and found them locked or possibly there is only one toilet? There was a sign instead to use the facilities on the third floor. Rather than go looking we decided to use the ones down by the garden on the way back to the car. Of the six I tried each one was either blocked with toilet paper or had no toilet paper.
All that being said the food itself was divine and we got cocktails which were gorgeous. It's just a pity for the price and the expectations that the service was not what we expected. Have had much better afternoon tea experiences elsewhere. Would recommend the K club, Heyfield in Cork, Mount Juliet, Shelbourne etc if you're looking to celebrate something with afternoon tea.",3,2022,03,06
217,Top class,From the welcome on the door from David to the reception staff was just exceptional. First class customer service and you can see these people take pride and enjoy there jobs. Nothing was too much. Beautiful suite and  fantastic food. A really memorable experience. We will be returning in the near future.,5,2022,03,05
217,Best Hotel Stay,One of the best hotel stays I have ever had. From check-in to check-out the staff were so friendly and attentive. We were celebrating our anniversary and we were given a complimentary upgrade to a beautiful suite. We also received a nice chocolate treat in our room and a dessert at dinner to mark the occasion. Both breakfast and dinner in Sika restaurant were delicious! Looking forward to returning already!,5,2022,02,28
217,Marvellous stay!,"We stayed in Powerscourt for midterm break and it did not disappoint. Our room was very spacious with a wonderful view. The atmosphere was quiet and the decor was smart and well maintained. There is an air of comfort and welcome in this hotel. The staff are wonderful and accommodating and I have no hesitation in recommending this to everyone. 5*
Please ensure you visit Avoca and the River Walk for a look. As it was winter, we didn’t visit the gardens but we intend to return.",5,2022,02,26
217,Not Honouring ‘Gift Cards’ - Extremely Disappointing!,"Extremely disappointed to find out that ‘Gift Cards’ purchased as presents are not being honoured. When we purchased them we were told there is no expiry date on them which was why we purchased them in the first place - due to a family illness they had not been used. 

I called ‘Powerscourt Hotel’ in November 2019 to ask about the ‘Gift Cards’ I was told by a lovely guy at the bookings desk that these ‘Gift Cards’ do not expire, he took the numbers of the two gift cards and said he would update them in the system and he called me back to confirm. I remember making the call as my father-in-law just had surgery for prostate cancer so we wanted to book them a treat at the hotel in the new year all going well. Due to COVID we were now looking to use them, family members were high risk.

When I called on 26th January wanting to use the ’Gift Cards’ for family, I was told by Diana at the bookings desk that these ‘Gift Cards’ were now only valid for a year and that ‘Powerescourt Hotel’ will not honour them, I explained that these gift cards have no expiry date on them.  We would never have purchased the gift cards in the first place if they were to expire in a year, we were told they had no expiry date, which was confirmed again in November 2019. I asked to speak to a manger and was given excuses, received an email from Jessica who works off site, couldn’t call and stated they would not honour the vouchers. Emailed her back to ask to speak to the manager.

After going through COVID for almost two years, family members were really looking forward to using the ‘Gift Cards’ that when purchased, had no expiry date on them. So not only have we lost our money but we had to tell our family members that they cannot use them. I’m sorry to say that when you purchase a voucher and are told it has no expiry date and told again in 2019 the same thing, it is unacceptable to now say they are only valid for a year. Manager did not call me back as requested, still waiting….speaks  for itself.",1,2022,02,23
217,"Nice Hotel, rooms and service 👎","The hotel is lovely from the first moment you drive in, the gardens the lobby everything brilliant. Our issues were with the room, amenities in the room and room service, we first walked in and spotted wallpaper falling off above our headboard which was just a small thing but nevertheless for the price annoying, then after dinner decided to retire to the room and relax watching TV when our TV just would not work and meant a member of staff had to come into our room at 12.30am for 10-15 minutes and move the dresser in front of the tv to eventually get the thing to connect and work. We then ordered room service where we payed €20 for a literal frozen pizza which wasn’t fully cooked through. Put an unfortunate dampener on a lovely residence",2,2022,02,23
217,A wonderful hotel,"I had an amazing one night stay in Powerscourt. The staff are amazing. From organising a little surprise left in the room to celebrate a birthday and to organising more water to be brought up to the room. The staff couldn't do more. The people in the restaurant were very friendly and very attentive. Drinks topped up before being asked and shout out to the chef the food was incredible. The room itself was divine and the view from the room was incredible.

It was a wonderful stay and already planning to come back",5,2022,02,22
217,Disorganised,"Stayed here the end of jan with family beautiful hotel with  friendly staff but wow lacking organisation . We didn’t get our room till after 5pm which I’m sorry but if other hotels can do 2/3pm why not this hotel ? 
For a five star hotel coeliacs are not catered for . Yes they have gf bread but the lunch and dinner options were very poor . For a five star hotel surely the chefs should include these things in their menu . Had to ask for the gf breakfast six times before I got it , at this point the whole family were finished including coffees . 
Rooms are beautiful but really feel this hotel needs some key managers to up its game to a true five star . Until then I’d hold off not worth the expense .",3,2022,02,20
217,Good 4 star experience,"We booked for 3 couples for a Saturday night. We arrived at 4 pm and the rooms were not ready. The receptionist tried to communicate to us behind a mask, screen an a piano playing in the background. It was very difficult. The reception area appeared to be a bit disorganised. However we got sorted and we were offered a complementary drink and upgrade for the delay.  We had dinner in the restaurant, the food was good, however the service was below par, what one would expect from an average 4 star. Food was dropped on the table, no explanation of some of the courses, which would have helped. The white wine was in a bucket 3 tables away and we had to go there to get it. As I noted the food was good, service a bit ad hoc. 

Unfortunately it rained very heavy all night, and the water on the window dropped to a plastic plate below It sounded like a drum solo all night. We did not have a good nights sleep. I would suggest that the manager sleeps in room 461 when it is raining. 

Overall not a 5 star experience, but a 5 star price 

Powerscourt would not be on my “ highly recommended” list.",3,2022,02,20
217,40th birthday stay,"I had a gorgeous stay with my partner and 5 month old. We went for 2 nights for my partners 40th and the hotel left a lovely little treat upon check in, that made his stay. We got a beautiful large superior room with a balcony and mountain view (room 634). I would really recommend this if looking for something special. I am a platinum Marriott member and everything was honoured. I have the app and found the chat function on it excellent to communicate and for pre-bookings. Crib was very comfortable for my 5 month old and he slept great! We ordered room service the first night and thought that there could be more selection, it was delivered within the said time frames. Breakfast was a buffet and excellent. Service all round the hotel was second to none. 

A fabulous stay and can’t wait to come back.",5,2022,02,19
217,Dump,"We arrived today 14 February  2022 at 2.15 for a 2 night relaxing stay, welcome break after lockdown. But what a disappointment, no running water in the whole hotel, couldn’t use the toilets and had to wait till 4.15 to get our room and it’s now 5.20 and still no running water!!! Paid for superior room, well what another disappointment, paid to over look a car park, same price as someone else who  paid to overlook the mountain, I know it’s not always possible to get a view but charge less for it!!  What a rip off. DEFINITELY won’t be back to a place like this!!!",1,2022,02,14
217,unorganised chaos and features not working. So dissapointing,"My wife and I, having had two prior excellent visits to Powerscourt, ( pre-Covid) were excited and delighted to be booked in for a Valentines break and with the added bonus of treating ourselves to some spa treatments during this stay also, however that is where a lot of the dissapointment and utter frustration begins.

Having booked originally and then upgraded our stay directly at the hotel, we then booked our spa treaments at the eSPa section of the hotel at which point I was told they would call to re-confirm the bookings in the Spa,  a couple of days before our visit, which was fine of course. However, the call came during work hours , 3 days before our visit and thus I could not take the call and the Spa left a vm asking me to call back and confirm. It took EIGHT attempts over the next 24 hours , for me to call and actually have someone pick up the phone at the other end to re-confirm as they wished - very frustrating and huge waste of my time.

The upon arrival and check-in, we were asked to check-in 2 rooms as the nobody had scratched off the initial booking, which was subsequently upgraded...so that created confusion and more frustration after just landing on site.
Then we made our way to the room and two of the main features we enjoyed and stood out to us previously ( the Chromecast feature on TV  and the Bathroom TV opposite the bath tub ) neither of them worked, so we could not use our playlists on Youtube to the TV as we had planned and enjoy and also could not enjoy the TV while bathing as there was no remote control in the room t turn it on. Calling Services for both was of no help.
We also booked into the Sika restaurant for lunch on our 2nd day and at check-in we had asked the receptionist to revise our booking to 1 hour earlier as our plans had changed slightly. When we arrived at the restuarant reception, there was more confusion and frustration again as we were questioned about 2 bookings that were on the list for lunch and which one was valid etc !??
Just to top it all off, we had just arrived in the door at home after our visit and I had a call from the eSpa stating they had undercharged us by €5 so could I take the time to go through a payment for that €5 over the phone with them.  This was definitely the straw that broke the camels back...what has changed since Covid-19 at Powerscourt ?   Nothing and nobody seemed to be joined up and confirmed actions were not taken and records adjusted accordingly, room items missing and not working and worst of all, it almost felt like an interogation with the constant questions and issues with our bookings, topped off by the phone call from the spa asing for another €5 payment due to their mistake . Unbelievable",1,2022,02,14
217,Bad bad service … ,"Stayed as a group of friends in August . The service was appalling from start to finish . We will never return … despite the fact that I have visited this hotel many times . Major issues here. Dinner in the restaurant was a new low. Hope they sort it out but it will be a long time before I spend the kind of money they command here .. for what was,  a truly sub par experience. ",1,2022,02,13
217,Will return..,"Iconic Hotel with fantastic reviews in a stunning location, but overall our stay was marred by the poor service.

From check in, at times it was chaotic and rushed. Across the whole hotel from Magills to Silka, they seemed understaffed and poorly trained, but bless, they all seemed to be trying so hard with little or no help from a superior. This all just marred the experience for us as we continously had to ask for more drinks, or where was our order. But all this wouldn't put me off returning. 
The hotel itself is stunning and immaculate, flawlessly clean with stunning views. Afternoon tea was a delight too ",4,2022,02,12
217,Rooms and location make up for poor service,The hotel is lovely and the spa and rooms are genuinely top of the range.  The location is great and the food and drink on offer are great.  The disappointment was the reception and hospitality staff (not in the restaurants - they were great) but my husband had tried to arrange champagne etc for a surprise on arrival and the wheels just came off and it wasn't in the room and then when it did come it wasn't cold and we still had it on our bill.  It also took45 minutes for them to bring us a bottle opened to use with our room service.,4,2022,02,10
217,5 star stay ⭐️,"Returned to powerscourt recently after a great stay last summer! On check in we were delighted to get upgraded to a beautiful mountain view suite, everywhere was spotless and every staff member we encountered from the moment we checked in was so friendly and helpful. We had dinner in mcgills and the food was amazing, special mention to Aldo who looked after us so well! We will definitely be back again soon!",5,2022,02,08
217,Staying at hotel January  2022  1 night,"CARPARK/CHECK IN
We had a very good stay. Firstly it was very easy to get parked  lots of spaces and right beside the hotel which is great. From the start we were made very welcome by the staff at the door and at check in. 

HOTEL/ROOM
A large part of why I gave this 4 star is because the hotel itself is very clean and beautifully designed.  We went for the larger room and it was definitely worth the extra price. Great view. Lots of space. His and her bathroom. Tv built into the mirror. Shower was very big. Huge bed in the room with two sets of built in wardrobes. I would bring some snacks of your own. There is a mini bar, coffee machine and snacks but these are of course, hotel prices. 

COVID RESTRICTIONS/ THE SPA
You have to pre book everything (dinner, the spa etc) and must wear a mask if you are walking around inside the hotel. The spa was ok. With Covid we did not get much of an experience. Just one 45 min slot each which must be pre-booked so keep this in mind. It is a bit disappointing but what can you do. 45 mins went super fast and I can only compare their spa facilities to other 5 star hotels I’ve stayed at and would rate the facilities as good but not 5 star  in my opinion. 

SIKA RESTAURANT - highlight of our stay.
We went to the sika restaurant it was €65 each for 3 courses. Partner had the butternut squash soup. I had the pan fried scallop. We both had ribeye. He had chocolate mousse and I the coconut bavarian cream for dessert. It was all very delicious. It was the highlight of our stay. Everything was beautifully cooked. I liked the little touches at the start. The breads. We enjoyed the smart dress code as we got to get dressed up. The staff were excellent working in the Sika Restaurant. 

MC GILLS PUB/ SUGAR LOAF LOUNGE
Afterwards, we wanted to have some drinks and went down to the McGills bar. We were refused entry as they were keeping the tables for customers who were ordering food. This is my main reason for not giving full 5* rating. After just spending over €150 upstairs in the sika restaurant in an hour, 2 people, we were very gutted to not be allowed in to the pub as the atmosphere looked really great. So we went upstairs to the sugar loaf lounge. The service was ok. Staff were polite but service was quite slow. If you are not seated close to staff members on the floor then you will have to get up and ask to be served yourself. We were next to the pianist. Staff were not walking around and checking if you wanted to order a drink for example or if you were finished a drink, the same problem again. No one around to take a new order. I found that a bit lacking given its 5 stars and of course the actual prices of the drinks were very high. 

I loved that they had open fires up here and another good point was that there was a pianist for a few hours. Which was lovely. 

BREAKFAST 
The breakfast was included in the room price which was good. There was a buffet / continental selection but also a la carte menu. It was very nice. Service was very good and lots of variety. Couldn’t be happier with the breakfast. 

THINGS TO DO
You will get plenty of information in your welcome package so be sure to check them leaflets out. We enjoyed heading up to the distillery and walking around the gardens. We went to avoca and had 
coffee. There was options to play golf, rent bikes or horse back ride etc but we were only there for one night.

I look forward to staying at this hotel again and have had mostly a positive experience!",4,2022,01,31
217,Afternoon Tea,"Myself and my friend went for afternoon tea here recently and we loved it ! I had a vegetarian stand and it was beautiful! Also any adjustments I made to it, we’re no problem. The view was amazing and the hotel lobby was steeped in luxury ! It had a great selection of teas that i thoroughly enjoyed! They gave a special chocolate sweet tray to my pregnant friend, with congratulations on it . This was so thoughtful! The toilets I used were so clean and the products were luxurious. A very big shoutout to a girl called Danielle, who was the most delightful, genuine and accommodating host we could ask her. She was a credit to the hotel and left a very good impression on us. I liked it so much and would love to go back to stay and get the full experience.",5,2022,01,30
217,Poor service. Freezing cold room,"I'll start with the positive - the hotel is really beautiful in an incredible location. The main restaurant's food is lovely (a bit rich to eat every night but a nice treat).
The staff are mostly very pleasant.
However it was one of the worst stays we've ever had. It was a honeymoon stay and we were told we had been upgraded to a suite. Checking in the room really was spectacular.
However we couldn't get the air con to turn off. We rang reception to ask for assistance and were told we hadn't put our key card properly (we had). Overnight the room was so uncomfortavly cold. There was no hot water and we had to farcically try to warm up using the hair dryer after our showers. In the morning we rang down to ask for either a room change or someone to fix the issue. A maintenance person came up and agreed there was a problem which they managed to resolve centrally.
A couple of hours later the same issue. We rang a total of 5 times and had people come up twice, both times agreeing there was an issue. We considered checking out that evening to find a b&b but we'd had a drink and thought it too much hassle which was a mistake as we both ended up feeling fluey (in the middle of August while we headed on to our next hotel).
We complained on check out and they gave us a small deduction on the fee but I'm still furious with myself for paying anything additional. We were fobbed off again and again by receptionists telling us to put our card in properly as if we were a pair of idiots.
I messaged them afterwards and they offered us a free stay in fairness, as by then I think they had realised there was a serious problem. I refused the offer, as honestly, this was the worst, most frustrating stay we have ever had and I can't imagine ever wanting to return, even for free. And while I thought the balance of our bill should have been waived on check out when I'd described our experience, in fairness they were at least eager to find a real resolution a week later (by which stage they no doubt understood it was an actual problem). Ultimately though, having stayed here for a wedding 10 years prior, I think something has been lost in staff understanding who is responsible for issues (little things were left go like the hand sanitiser station at the elevator being empty for our entire stay despite staff using the lift).

In one sense my review is harsh, given that it really is a spectacular place to stay, but when you pay those prices and wish you'd instead booked a budget b&b, that 1 issue overshadows the positives by some length.
 Looking at the reviews since our stay it's clear the performance in that regard has taken a dramatic turn  for the worse in the last 6 months. I",1,2022,01,27
217,Spectacular 5 ⭐️,"Unbelievable hotel,  from check in to check out everything and everyone is 5 ⭐️ 
McGills is brilliant, a traditional Irish pub in the middle of hotel, spa & pool area fantastic, sky sports channels in the bedrooms, can’t find any faults apart from price of pint being €6.60 for Guinness & €6.80 for lager but it is a 5 star 🌟 definitely be back",5,2022,01,25
217,Enjoyable Afternoon,"Had afternoon tea here recently and have to say I really enjoyed it. We had a lovely table overlooking the gardens. Tables were quite close together but the screen did provide a bit of comfort and covid certs were checked. Afternoon tea appears on the small side upon arrival but it was quite rich and filling and very tasty so it was hard to manage it all in the end! Would have been nice to see a non alcoholic option. My friend asked for prosecco but got charged 15 euro for a glass of champagne. Service was attentive and friendly. It was busy, there was a lovely buzz around and we enjoyed the luxurious setting of the foyer. It is pricey but an afternoon well spent.",4,2022,01,24
217,Beautiful hotel. Food and service lets it down,"We have just returned from a 2 night break at this beautiful hotel and I must say the facilities in the room did not disappoint us. We were given a complimentary upgrade to a superior room and it was fantastic. It was a very big, spacious room with a large dressing area and very spacious bathroom. The bed was super king size and was extremely comfortable and the facilities in the room were amazing unfortunately the restaurant and service let this wonderful hotel down.
We ate in the Restaurant on the first night and although the food was just ok but the service was not and neither was the choice on the menu. We ordered our food and drinks at the same time and were served our drinks fairly quickly then we waited about 15 minutes when a member of staff approached us asking did we require a dessert menu, at this stage we had not even received our starters and the staff member should have noticed we still had all our cutlery on our table. Eventually we were served our starters and they were disappointing to be honest as was the main course. We expected much more from such a high class hotel. On our second night we decided to try the food in the bar, we arrived down about 7.45 to be told there were 9 people in the queue in front of us and the bar was full, the waiter told us he could not be sure we would get a table before the bar stopped serving food at 9.30. Our only alternative was to go back to the restaurant or have room service. I think if the bar is usually this packed then perhaps a booking system needs put in place to prevent people being disappointed. We ended up back in the restaurant but were not happy. I did not order a starter and n=my husband did not order a dessert but we were charged the full price even though we were told on the first evening we could choose either a 2 or 3 course meal. Another disappointment during our stay was the fact that when we returned to our room after a long day out walking although our room had been freshened and cleaned I found my night wear lying on the floor in the corner and I had not left it there I also found a cleaning cloth lying in the bathroom. Although these are relatively small problems I feel they need addressed. 
The pool/spa area was beautiful and very peaceful but on our second day the jacuzzi area of the pool was unavailable due to a ""cleaning issue""
The staff at the front door of the hotel were most helpful in providing us with information about the local area and walks etc available to us.
Everyone in the hotel were wearing masks but at no stage during our stay were we asked for our Covid Vaccination passport and this left us feeling a bit uneasy. 
This is a beautiful hotel which we would like to return to but feel somewhat let down by all of the issues mentioned above but in particular the issue surrounding food and service.",4,2022,01,18
217,Spa day,"Fantastic attention to detail & wonderful experience here recently @ The Spa
Thanks to Katie & Rachel for our treatments 
Both excellent 
Lunch also delicious 
Highly recommend this gorgeous 5 star 
Spa retreat",5,2022,01,13
217,Spectacular stay in an elegant and grand resort,"Everything about our stay was spectacular! The service from the time we arrived to the time we departed was excellent especially from the bellman, Tatu, the waitress Holly and others in Sika!

The grounds are breathtaking. The decor is elegant. The beds were very comfortable and the rooms very spacious.",5,2022,01,03
217,Amazing views and atmosphere,We recently were in the hotel for a wedding. We found the staff to be helpful in regards to finding our way around out hotel. The ballroom was beautifully decorated along with the rest of the hotel for Christmas. The servers were very friendly and attentive during the wedding especially our server zia who was very helpful in regards to the kids order. The day 2 wedding was lovely with a selection of buffet foods and a lovely toast for New Years. It was a lovely experience and we can’t wait to come back!,5,2022,01,03
217,More of a 3 star than a 5 star hotel.,"Wasn’t overly impressed with this hotel for the money they charge. 
Staff are not trained to a 5 star level whatsoever. Found the staff very blunt and direct with no friendliness and not overly helpful. Not what you’d expect of a 5 star hotel not sure how they earned this. 
The hotel itself is very clean (inside) and located in a beautiful spot, has a beautiful pool.
Food far too fancy for a regular family dinner type and again extortionate money without basic options on the menu and only one not nice vegetarian option.",3,2022,01,03
217,Happy holidays!,"Reception: Warmest welcome we ever received so far - all thanks to Mauve who was fantastic all throughout the check-in process. She had a great way of setting the tone of our stay here. 

Concierge: Amazing as well especially the one who assisted us during check-in/postage assistance - quite attentive and friendly. 

Sika Restaurant: Stepanka was great during breakfast. She made us feel at home. Good thing to see that the GM and DMs were quite hands on during this time. 

Sugar Loaf Lounge: Nothing but good words to the staff who assisted us when we had our afternoon tea. The food was exquisite and instagrammable. I like the coffee by the way (take it from someone who really likes coffee).

McGills: If you’re looking for an Irish pub within the property, this is perfect for you. I personally like the steak. Cheers to the chef!

Overall: It was a wonderful experience from their services, whole ambiance of the property upto the breathtaking scenery. You did not disappoint. As someone who used to work in the industry, I can definitely say that I am impressed. 5-star indeed! Can’t wait to come back soon.

P.S. Please extend our sincerest gratitude to all the staff as we weren’t able to get all their names. Cheers and Happy Christmas!",5,2021,12,24
217,Over promises but under delivers,"Impressive hotel on beautiful grounds. Lovely bedroom which was immaculately clean. Our 9yo was most impressed with the TV in the bathroom! Very nice pool area and also the bikes were great. 

But sadly it was all a bit let down by hit and miss service. We ate in the Sika restaurant and found some simple requests off menu were met with perplexed responses. We asked for a small portion of smoked salmon for our daughter instead of the kids menu which was a bit unimaginative. We were told it wasn’t possible. Fine, except when we came down to breakfast in the morning 2 large platters of smoked salmon were sitting there, begging the question, why couldn’t they provide some at dinner? Starters arrived before our drinks which is always annoying. I saw this happen at a few tables. Something they need to address. Starters were fairly tasteless. Mains were good, as was dessert. Breakfast was very good. 

The main issue was when we went to check out. When I checked the bill, we had been overcharged for our dinner. When I queried this I had to stand there for over 30 mins while 2 staff agonised over receipts. I don’t mind them checking but it edged into the realm of the ridiculous. Just standing there asking can I go now please?! 

Anyway, they eventually resolved how the error had happened (nothing to do with us!) and they waived the cost of our child’s meal by way of what I thought was an apology. 

Then 2 days later I get an email from the hotel saying that I haven’t paid my full bill from my recent stay and could I pay as soon as possible. You guessed it….the outstanding amount was the amount that had been waived. I pointed this out to them and a day later I get a reply apologising and that was it. 

To be completely fair, we managed to leave a precious toy in our room which the hotel did locate and post to us but even the communications around that were all over the place and just caused unnecessary stress. 

It just all seemed a bit haphazard and shoddy. Our one night stay wasn’t cheap and I expected better. Won’t be going back. Too much hassle.",2,2021,12,23
217,Not Worth It,"Today myself and my husband went for afternoon tea in this stunningly beautiful hotel. Unfortunately unlike the surroundings it was a massive let down! The sandwiches (which we were really looking forward too, .... we'd travelled from Laois and were hungry), were very disappointing, 2 of them tasted like yesterday's bread, and the filling very sparce. We've enjoyed afternoon tea in a number of Hotels in Ireland but todays was the worst! At 50 euro per head it was definitely NOT value for money.
Very disappointed Powerscourt!

217,A wonderful experience,"we stayed for my wifes birthday and it was a superb time, the room was magnificent, the staff so very friendly and helpful.  Dinner was served efficiently and  cheerfully by a lovely young lady, all in all a very memorable stay",5,2021,12,08
217,Where service doesn’t really matter anymore.,"My wife and I have a bucket list of hotels that we have always wanted to visit, and we use special occasions to visit the elite and expensive hotels for this reason. 
We recently had the opportunity of my 60th birthday to go to Powerscourt and it was very expensive for one night bed and breakfast. As we are both asthmatic we always contact any hotel we are due to stay in to ask them not to leave feather duvets or pillows on the bed and also to not spray any chemicals on the carpet. We received a reply by email 5 days before our stay to state that they received our instructions and would carry out our request.
We arrived at the hotel and were sent to a beautiful room with a balcony overlooking the amazing landscaped gardens and views of the mountains beyond. We started to unpack and my wife moved one of the pillows only to discover it was a feather pillow. I phoned housekeeping and told them we would be going out of the room soon and they could change the pillows then, to cut down on close contact. I barely had the phone down and a guy arrived at the door to change the pillows. 
Also, just after we entered the room when we first arrived, a guy in a suit arrived at the door and just rang the doorbell and proceeded to walk in, thinking we possibly hadn’t arrived yet. He had a card and a small box of chocolates to wish me a happy birthday. Would have been a nicer touch if they had been there when I arrived.
We were going to eat in the hotel and had a look at the options available. Fine dining for exorbitant prices or burger and chips or battered fish and chips for around €25 each and served in a very tacky dark bar scene. So instead of being able to relax and enjoy our hotel break we ended up having to go out on a horrible winters night and get food locally. 
We went back to the room to relax for the rest of the evening only to find we had only one armchair and a half broken desk chair to sit on and watch the tv. We also wondered how breakfast to the room would work out also. Next morning they wheeled a table to the door which was a standard €5 extra charge which the guy insisted on being paid for immediately and even had the audacity to ask if I wanted to give him a tip. 
I had to ring down for some more still water and coffee pods for the machine. 20 minutes later I thought it was taking a bit longer than I expected, so I put my head out into the corridor and almost tripped over a bag on the doorstep with the items inside. No knock on the door and didn’t even ring the doorbell to let me know they had left them. 
My wife had a shower and came out to dry her hair. The hair dryer has a spiral coil on it and is extremely short. We had to pull the desk table away from the wall to plug it in close to a mirror in order for her to use it. 
A few  times that I needed to ring reception, the phone went unanswered. 
On the morning we were leaving I asked to speak to a manager at the reception, despite having asked for a manager to contact us the evening before. I got talking to a very nice man who sat and listened to my story as if it was the tenth time that morning alone that he had heard about a customers dissatisfaction. He thanked me for my honesty and for filling him in on my gripes, but offered absolutely no apology or anything to even help alleviate my situation. 
No doubt the hotel will reply also in the same vain to this review and thank me for taking the time to write. If you fail to realise the amount of negative reviews your hotel is now receiving since the Autograph group took over, please don’t be surprised when more people start voting with their feet and go to other three and four star hotels who will do a lot more to keep their customers. I will not be back any time soon",2,2021,12,04
217,"Five star prices, two star service","My wife and I stayed here for two nights in October 2021 and were left very disappointed with our overall experience. The grounds are fantastic and the rooms are beautiful (which is why I give 2 stars rather than 1), but the service was really poor. This is a hotel with eye-wateringly high 5-star prices, but the service absolutely does not match. 

I ordered a pint of beer with our meal on the first night, and it took over 20 minutes to arrive. By this point I barely wanted it as I was half way through my main course. The meal was disappointing too, with a steak that was over 50%  fat. 

On the second night there was a wait to get a table at the bar, and rather than notify us when it was our turn (like they said they would) the bar staff skipped ahead to several other customers. 

Overall, the staff just seemed very wooden and robotic - there was no personality and none of the usual Irish friendliness we are famed for. The manager on the first night was beyond unfriendly - he made us feel like idiots because my wife realised she booked the table through her maiden name rather than married name. A good manager should have made a joke out of it.

When we outlined our concerns at check out we were told a manager would phone us. He did phone us later that day but took the opportunity to defend his staff and brush us off with empty platitudes like ""I'll personally see to it that your experience is exceptional on your next visit"". It was then a pleasure to inform him there wouldn't be a next visit. We had also planned on buying our parents vouchers to come here as a Christmas present. We certainly won't be doing that now.",2,2021,11,29
217,Two fantastic visits.,"I have been lucky enough to visit the hotel twice over the last couple of months, our first visit  was to stay overnight for our 25th wedding anniversary which was fantastic from check in the reception staff gave us a great welcome and checked us in and bags sent to the room while we had a lovely lunch and dinner in Sika, I would like to especially mention Christina and Brona from reception and Christian from Sika who gave us 5 star treatment all the way. The second visit was for Afternoon tea all I can say is everybody needs to treat themselves to this well worth the money and great place to catch up with family and friends we had lovely waitress I think her name was Mete.",5,2021,11,29
217,"Lovely hotel, beautifully designed ","I live in Dublin but I love going to Wicklow for a break from the city. Nicest hotel I love going back here, prices are a bit crazy though. I remember staying at it years ago when it opened as the ritz but now prices are much higher. Its really nice though and pool is fab. ",5,2021,11,27
217,The loveliest of hotels!,"We wanted to be near Dublin (but not right in the thick of things), and this was the perfect solution. The team at Powerscourt was efficient, helpful, and took stellar care of us and our requests throughout our stay. The hotel was decorated for Christmas, and just enchanting. Lunch and breakfast were elegantly served, and the views of the surrounding grounds was breathtaking. Our room was just wonderful, with an expansive patio running the length of our space, and defined sitting, sleeping, bathing and dressing spaces, all artfully designed. We will be back (our short stay didn’t allow for golfing, a full garden, or distillery tour)!",5,2021,11,23
217,Popped by for a tea/hot chocolate in the Reception area!!! so cannot judge the actual hotel!!,"The three of us were in the area and just popped by for a tea and hot chocolate.
The waitress working in the restaurant area was slow to take our orders.
Another waitress kept pestering us about our vaccination, which we had already shown outside.
Our tea came. One spoon was missing. There was no sugar.
And without asking the waitress placed the bill on the table, without us having asked for it.
We felt as if they wanted us to leave.
They were unfriendly and had an air of great importance.
Such a pity! A beautiful area to sit and have a drink but if you get the impression straight away that you are not welcome,  one will not return.",2,2021,11,17
217,So Disappointing,"My new husband and I booked Powerscourt for our honeymoon to stay for 2 nights over Halloween. Definitely a beautiful place, the hotel, the grounds and the room were phenomenal. However, the service and our treatment with a customer dispute after check out has been very far from 5 star. We ate from 2 of the 3 onsite restaurants, McGills Pub was lovely. Real pub grub, exactly what we were looking for, delicious. The second night, we decided to try Sally Gap restaurant, a little fancier. Our server was brilliant but the food was not. We moved on to Sugar loaf lounge for drinks, to which we were disappointed further at the lack of service. We could never find a server to place an order so we went 20mins at a time with empty glasses trying to get our next drink ordered. It wasnt a particularly busy evening. All those things aside, the most disappointing and quite frankly distressing issue we had and are still having after our stay, is getting a refund after being charged for a meal we didn't even have. 130euro was charged to our room, which I stupidly didnt notice until after check out. Over 2 weeks later they still havent refunded us. Even though the receptionist told me, after I noticed the error, that the refund would be processed and I would receive it in a matter of days. Two phone calls since, we are still waiting. Sincerely disappointed.",2,2021,11,15
217,Enchanting stay,"Stayed here for my partners Birthday... The drive in was breathtaking beautiful views.... Check in was swift and staff were on hand to assist with luggage and and queries we had... We choose to have a meal in McGills bar the first night of our stay the food was exceptional but our server was not pleasent and seemed they wanted to be anywhere else than serving our meal... This was the only member of staff we encountered like this

The breakfast was the best we have experienced on our travels... The scones were amazing as was the eggs benedict... The pool and facilities were clean and relaxing the gardens and festive decorations were amazing.... We will be back",5,2021,11,12

217,5 star,"Beautiful hotel, very luxurious.   Grounds and hotel are amazing.   Very expensive but worth it.

Lunch was delicious but dinner was just ok, not sure they have enough staff.   The long queue for check in and check out was very annoying though.",5,2021,10,31
217,This hotel is heaven on earth,"I have just checked out of the most beautiful hotel today, my partner treated me for my birthday. The staff went above and beyond for us, the hotel is absaloutley spotless and our room was just fabulous with a beautiful bathroom. We had some spa treatments with Christina who is just amazing at what she does I already can't wait to come back for another hot stone massage. The food in Mc gills pub is fantastic. The breakfast in sika restaurant was just as amazing with beautiful views of the mountains while you dine. Sugar loaf lounge is stunning to sit and unwind with a drink. The gardens around powerscourt would take your breath away beautiful walk. The hotel also complied 100% with Covid 19 rules they had hand sanitizer stations in every area along with bacterial wipes and a personal bottle of hand sanitizer in our room. Thank you for an amazing trip it made my birthday very special we can't wait to visit again.",5,2021,10,30
217,wonderful thanks to Sarah Lavin & staff on the front desk,Bengie once again made our stay we were back after 2 years absent & the hotel is a haven of peace --could not believe that Bengie could remember us --&   the server at breakfast took such care of us that we felt like Royalty  Louissa  I think was her name ----we are heading back next month as its our birthday treat to us both--- a holiday back in Ireland from SW  UK,5,2021,10,24
217,Disappointing,"The hotel check in was great and super efficient. We were shown to our room by a very welcoming staff member. The room was lovely - nice and big with a big bathroom and lovely balcony with view over the garden. We a in McGills the first night - food was only ok and very expensive for what you got. Also as a coeliac the options were extremely limited. McGills was a bit tired and had sticky floors. Spent the day at the spa and it was lovely with very nice staff. Dinner on night 2 was in Sika. Food was fine but again so overpriced - you’d get a lovely meal in a good restaurant in Dublin for the same price. Also we were put at a table beside three babies under 2. Babies cried throughout dinner and ran riot - not exactly the most relaxing atmosphere for a meal - neither the parents or restaurant seemed to be able to control the situation. I totally appreciate that people have to be able to bring their children out but a designated area for families would be recommended as it really ruined the meal and we ended up finishing our drinks in the sugar loaf lounge where we weren’t listening to screaming babies. All in all, while the hotel was fine I probably wouldn’t return and there are better hotels for the same price.",3,2021,10,23
217,No one picks up the phone,"I was trying to book afternoon tea for Christmas with a group of friends . I contacted the hotel multiple times . I then sent an email no reply . I kept ringing, it must have been 15 times  or more over the course of  three days before I got an answer. 

 I then asked after booking afternoon tea could the lady direct my phone across to the spa so we could book spa treatments  and she said  they can’t do that I must  ring back to which I told them my difficulty getting an answer and she said there was nothing she could do . I rang the spa four times and  got no answer and gave up . For a five star hotel it’s completely unacceptable",1,2021,10,23
217,No-one answers the phone,"We got a gift of 2 nights here. A couple of weeks before our booking, three of us tried at various times to contact the hotel by phone to book spa treatments and retaurants, but after the automated welcome message and ""press 1, 2, 3 etc"", our calls (to all of the options offered) were never answered and no option to leave a voicemail was available. No email address was shown on our reservation details or on the hotel website. When I made contact via the global Marriot website detailing the problem, the response (3 days later) asked me what my conerns were! It appears no-one actually read the web form.
On arrival we stopped at the very wide set-down area, but we are asked not to unload there, but go to the car park and drag our cases back to the hotel. I insisted on unloading and was urged to move my car as soon as possible. What a sweet welcome!
When we got in and asked why the phones were not answered, staff just said they are VERY busy. Too busy to answer the phone?
Otherwise our stay was pleasant.",2,2021,10,11
217,"Beautiful, grand  hotel,  restaurant lovely too.","Wonderful hotel, very good, professional service (echoes of the Ritz). Quite expensive (the wine list excessively so - take your own) though the three course meal in the Sika restaurant represents very good value. Room opulent and very clean. Nearby Powerscourt gardens very fine - definitely worth a visit. Would definitely recommend.",5,2021,10,10
217,really lovely hotel.,"From start to finish our visit to this hotel was brilliant, i booked it over the phone with the nicest girl, her name was Diana, and nothing was too much trouble, she was an absolute pleasure to deal with.
upon arrival we checked in with another lovely girl, Sohpia, again, she was so nice and approachable. nothing was too much trouble, she changed some of our internal bookings and booked othesr for us, without any trouble.
we dined in the bar the first night and the waitress Anne was so friendly and 'happy', constantly smiling. 
the other staff i have to mention is Vithor ( i hope i spelt this correctly ) and niamh, they both looked after us in the reception bar. so friendly,  chatty.
Nicole serviced us for breakfast, again such a lovely girl.
the staff at this hotel are without question their absolutely biggest asset. 
would highly recommend a stay here. hotel is fantastic, and the setting, second to none.",5,2021,10,10
217,Family trip,"Had a lovely stay in this hotel, the rooms are very nice and the bed is to die for so comfortable and the pillows are the best.

Only disappointment was Sika restaurant, we were told to book a table for 20:00, because a party of 21 had booked, and we despite booking the table for 8pm were kept waiting for 15 minutes, we also asked for a window table, which didn’t materialise, no tooth picks either

But on the whole it was a very enjoyable stay, only wished we could have stayed longer, but they didn’t have rooms with double beds for our two night stay

Highly recommended",4,2021,10,08
217,Finally got there post COVID! Totally worth the wait.,"Stayed for 8 nights and loved every minute. Immaculate throughout…room was beautiful, very romantic, splash shower invigorating (big enough to share!) both restaurants we used were excellent although Sally Gap was perhaps less atmospheric. The Irish bar is ideal if you don’t want a full meal (the fish chowder is very tasty and deceptively filling). Breakfasts are exactly what you want, but they are probably rather restricted still post COVID…(please restore the soda bread and sour dough rather than plain toast)….nevertheless the full Irish is delicious and it is full!
All the staff we had dealings with were very friendly and helpful, it is an extremely peaceful and calming hotel in a tranquil and beautiful part of Ireland. We are so pleased that we persevered with getting there.",5,2021,09,27
217,Amazing hotel,"Booked 3 nights and loved it so much we stayed an extra night. From the moment we arrived we were treated so well, the staff were all so nice, friendly, warm and efficient. 
We were shown to our room and were blown away by the view.  The room itself was large and bright and beautifully furnished.  My one gripe would be that there was no kettle, just a coffee maker. Now I know that these are hugely popular but for me personally the water just isn't hot enough. The beds were just like big clouds, so soft and comfy. 
We ate in McGills bar a couple of nights, the food was lovely and as you would expect, rather expensive. We had breakfast in our room, purely because the allocated times in the restaurant didn't suit us with our spa treatments - the problems of a modern world! It arrived on time and was piping hot, really good. We did have breakfast in the restaurant on 2 mornings, again it was really well organised and the food was great. 
We spent time sitting in the beautiful lobby in the evenings, its a lovely place to sit and have a drink. 
A must visit is Powerscourt House and Gardens which is adjacent to the hotel, there is also a golf course if that’s  your thing.  
We cant wait to return.",5,2021,09,24
217,"Disappointing, indifferent, hotel in nice grounds","I booked a Mountain View suite with balcony. Having read some exceptional reviews and the Marriott marketing literature I was looking forward to an enjoyable stay.
Unfortunately - 
On arrival I was allocated a room overlooking the parking lot. When I queried this it was explained to me that not everyone booking a Mountain View Suite could be given a mountain view as not all Mountain View rooms actually had a mountain view.
Service in the Sika restaurant was particularly slow, and despite all the hype in the hotel marketing, the food is decidedly average.
There was mould in the bathroom but otherwise the hotel was reasonably clean superficially.
The hotel certainly is not value for money, great location, but a very average Marriott experience.",1,2021,09,12
217,A Wonderful Stay for our Autumn Honeymoon,"For our honeymoon in October 2020 we stayed in Powerscourt Hotel. We were originally meant to stay for 2 nights but decided to extend the experience for 7 days after having such an amazing stay. It was such a beautiful experience. Autumn was in the air and the hotel looked wonderful. The backdrop of the Sugar Loaf and the wonderful gardens surrounding the hotel, with trees with seasonally changing leaves, along with the hot port and hot drinks available made for an unforgettable experience. 
The staff in Powerscourt are incredible. When we went for Afternoon Tea, we had such a special experience. The waiter was very thoughtful and gave us special treatment because it was our Honeymoon. He even gave us two pastry lovebird swans on a plate which stole the show. I couldn't recommend Afternoon Tea more at this hotel. It is by far the best Afternoon Tea I have had. The original, creative teas that taste of rhubarb and lemon pie and all sorts of interesting tastes. The food was amazing at the Afternoon Tea and the restaurant. 
Our room was luxurious and had a beautiful view of the grounds. We were able to take bikes out for free to discover the wonderful gardens. I had two spa treatments and both were so relaxing. 
Altogether an amazing experience, Thank you, Liam and Kate",5,2021,09,11
217,Beautiful hotel and grounds,"Had a relaxing stay here, rooms were so spacious, grand and really felt like a 5 star hotel. However this did not extend to the staff, who I felt were slightly inexperienced..maybe this is due to COVID however if we are being charged the same amount for a room as pre-covid, the entire experience should be at the same level. The bar staff couldn't make me a drink that wasn't on their (small) menu. This is a 5 star hotel and bar staff should be able to make something as simple as a Daiquiri or Caipirinha. Also the restaurant staff were inattentive and until it was pointed out  to them and then it became stalkery - please try harder if you expect people to pay this much for a high-end experience.",4,2021,09,08
217,Fantastic stay,"Myself and my 2 friends stayed in this fabulous  hotel for a midweek treat and it was a delicious treat indeed.The staff were so friendly and helpful and nothing was too much trouble..
Our room was amazing as we had a fantastic view of the garden .The room was so clean and the bathroom products were lovely.
We used the pool and the facilities and everything was just lovely and comfortable.
We had dinner in McGills bar and the fish and chips were delicious.
We had breakfast the next day outside looking up at the Sugar loaf mountain which was lovely,the food and service was spot on and I would go back to this hotel in a heartbeat.
Thank you all 
Eimear",5,2021,09,02
217,An amazing 5 Star experience,"My wife and I stayed at the Powerscourt Hotel in Wicklow for the weekend of July 2nd this summer and it was brilliant, it really felt like a 5 star experience. The staff were really warm and professional, the hotel was immaculate and really well run and the food in the Sika restaurant for breakfast lunch and dinner was really good, we didn’t want to leave. The spa, pool and grounds facilities were excellent and there was so much to do with Powerscourt gardens and Enniskerry village a short walk away where they were filming Echanted 2. We would highly recommend, Peter & Claire.",5,2021,08,31
217,5 star,"Stayed just one night in amazing Powerscourt wished it could have been longer. From the friendly welcome from Maeve at the front desk to a lovely dinner and great breakfast (Larraine our server was so nice as were all staff we encountered). It's location, the views, the peace and quiet, comfy bed. Loved.",5,2021,08,31
217,Best hotel I have ever stayed in,Wonderful stay. Room was amazing and spotless. Hotel is really classy and exquisitely decorated. Staff were all very friendly and very attentive. Had dinner in McGills one night and Sika the second night - both were very good. Breakfast was very good. Nicest hotel I have ever stayed in.,5,2021,08,29
217,A wonderful break at Powerscourt Hotel!,"Our stay at Powerscourt Hotel was nothing short of incredible! From the very moment we walked through the doors, we were greeted by friendly and welcoming staff. A particular mention to the doorman, David, who was so friendly and kind during our stay, offering lots of advice on local walks and activities. Upon arrival, we were delighted to receive an upgrade for our room and were treated to such a beautiful suite - the bed was a dream, 
 
Everything from the cocktails to the food, to the atmosphere in the hotel, was just wonderful, and whilst the staff were so vigilant to Covid measures we still felt a sense of normality and relaxation during our stay that we have all been missing. The dinner in Sika restaurant was truly incredible and a particular thank you to all the young staff who were so incredibly attentive and kind during our stay, they truly created the 5-star experience for us.
 
I think people are quick to send feedback on a negative experience but unfortunately slow to do so when it has been a positive one so after our amazing stay I just wanted to send on a big thank you to all of the staff and team at Powerscourt Hotel. It was definitely the break we needed and I am already looking at booking a trip back sometime in December to experience the Christmas magic at Powerscourt.",5,2021,08,25
217,Superb!,"We are just back from a 1-night stay at the amazing Powerscourt Hotel. From the moment we drove into the car park we were made to feel very welcome and we are delighted we got the opportunity to experience the superb facilities and service that this hotel has to offer. We were given a superior room that was extremely well appointed and comfortable. It also had amazing views of the rear gardens and activity area where we got to watch a falconry show from our balcony. We got to use the swimming pool, sauna, steam room, etc, on the day we arrived and the next day before we left and the whole experience was brilliant - the whole place was spotlessly clean, an abundance of towels and water, etc. We had lunch and dinner in the Sika Restaurant which was an amazing experience. Our food & wine at both meals was incredible and served to us by very well trained, attentive and courteous staff who just made the whole experience - they simply couldn't do enough for us. All in all, this was an amazing day/night away.....5 star all the way!",5,2021,08,23
217,Outstanding!,"Where do I start … 5 star at its finest! We have stayed a few times in the Powerscourt Hotel and every time the service, hotel cleanliness, food, leisure facilities etc have been first class. 

From the time you check in till you leave you are given 5-star service, all the staff are very professional and very attentive.  The atmosphere is always very relaxing, views are stunning and the leisure / pool facilities are some of the best I’ve experienced. We also had dinner in the restaurant, fine wine and the food was beautiful. Breakfast is also amazing, while looking out on the Wicklow mountains!

While in the estate we did some of the activities they have around the hotel, Powerscourt House and Gardens is well worth a visit, small entry cost which is well worth it. Linked to the hotel is a complementary pass to the Powerscourt River walk, which is stunning, you can also use the bikes the hotel provide. Enniskerry Village is a short walk from the hotel, where scenes of the Disney film Disenchanted were recently filmed

I would highly recommend this hotel and we will definitely be back",5,2021,08,21
217,Loved the Powerscourt!,"We absolutely loved our stay at the Powerscourt. Our room was huge, more of a suite really (even though it was a deluxe room), and it was immaculate. The dining is fantastic—we really liked McGill’s Pub. The grounds and location next to the Powerscourt Gardens are great, as is the proximity to Dublin. 5 stars!",5,2021,08,17
217,Amazing hotel but mcgills lets it down,Wouldn’t normally go out my way to write a review but felt this needed to be said . Newly engaged and treated ourselves to a night away to celebrate in a superior room with dins and breakfast included. Check in was fast and easy went for drink in sugar loaf bar done pool I had drink at 3 in mcgills no problem and had afternoon tea at half 3  was all amazing staff were all on top their game and so nice to talk to . Decided to have a drink again in mcgills at 5 and was Turn away from bar cause we wouldn’t have food explained we had afternoon tea but didn’t take any notice very embarrassing to say the least for a five start hotel to turn you away for just waiting a drink and no food and only two people sitting in bar also at this time . Sofia at reception put drinks on tab in sugar loaf bar to apologize thanks again Sofia . All in all amazing hotel but can’t say this hasn’t left sour taste in our mouth and doubts of returning to hotel again in the future,4,2021,08,16
217,Staff friendly but service disappointing,"Our family had a lovely stay, however the service isn’t up to 5 stars. It was our first time at Powerscourt and we were so excited. On arrival, reception couldn’t find our booking even though we had the email with names and confirmation number. The staff nearly gave us someone else’s room which would have been incredibly awkward. Just a bad start which could have been easily avoided. When we got this sorted rooms were ready and they were amazing! The rooms are 5 star and fabulous. The pool is really nice & the facilities are top quality. Bookings are on the hour for 45 mins and we had more than enough time. We ate in Sika restaurant & the food was delicious, 6 people all ordered different dishes and we all had a great meal. Overall the hotel is lovely but their downfall is the lack of training their staff have. They were so friendly and nice but the lack of attention to detail was so noticeable. Trying to order a drink at dinner was nearly impossible. When we did get our wine, it was poured and then put at another guests table, not our own. Empty glasses and dishes not taken away after courses. I think if the staff had more training it would be 5 star. We were due to come back for our honeymoon in a couple of weeks time, however we have decided not to return for now. Hopefully improvements are made.",3,2021,08,15
217,Powerscourt Hotel and Spa,"My wife and I  recently enjoyed a wonderful trip away to Powerscourt Hotel and Spa. It was our first night away since we welcomed our baby girl into the world. On hearing this the hotel staff went out of their way to make our visit as enjoyable as possible. The scenery and facilities of the hotel are second to none. We really enjoyed our stay enjoying wonderful food and trip to the spa. 
A massive thank you to the management and all the staff.
Conor Co. Mayo",5,2021,08,12
217,Excellent service,"We were guests at a family wedding and stayed overnight. At arrival we were warmly welcomed, received our keys immediately and dropped our luggage into the most comfortable room. The location and hotel are beautiful and so are the staff. Having inadvertently left something behind in my room, which I discovered 3 weeks later, one phone call to the hotel was all it took to rectify and I received my parcel by post 2 days later. Now that's top quality service.
For an experience like no other, stay at Powerscourt, it is wonderful.",5,2021,08,11
217,Terrible Customer Service,"This hotel has been on my to visit list for a while. We tried booking this hotel for a special occasion on a Sunday night. Very disappointed with the service when we called, considering this is supposedly a 5 star hotel.  There was availability for our date on  the website but we wished to speak to a staff member on additions etc., when we rang there was no one from reservations available, a staff member tried to answer our questions but shockingly had no a clue on availability, prices etc.  we were told they would call us back asap. No call back, still no call back on Monday morning so we rang again. We were then told by reception that there was a high volume of calls and would be called back by a member of reservations.  Eventually when we were called back, hours later, we were told there was now no availability!! Without so much as an apology from staff. I had such high hopes for the establishment and had been looking forward to going here but I am Very very disappointed and I have been put off ever booking a stay in this hotel.",1,2021,08,09
217,Luxury in Powerscourt,"Had a mini break in Powerscourt and overall it was a divine experience. Check in (as well as check out) was a little slow but we had some cocktails in the bar while we waited for our room. Staff seem a bit inexperienced and immature and service can be a little slow. Great drinks and cocktail menu, lots of options for food too. Amazing setting with beautiful views and our room was unbelievable- spacious, beautifully furnished with all the mod cons you could want! Food was excellent in the Sally Gap and lovely, high quality breakfast. Only criticism, besides slightly inexperienced staff, was how noisy and busy the pool was, even at 10am, it was full of screaming kids, we just went to have a swim and use the steam room, but if we’d booked relaxing spa treatments and wanted to relax and utilise the facilities after I would have been quite disappointed",5,2021,08,07
217,Ireland Finest Five Star,"Myself and my family are just back from a wonderful weekend at Powerscourt, the setting of this hotel is idyllic. When we arrived we were greeted my the most pleasant team and assigned an impressive room overlooking a garden. This was our first time staying in a hotel this year and every member of staff made you feel at ease, there were numerous sanitisation points, we had to book all of our meal times which we did before we arrived, Breakfast was really well organised and there was such a great selection on offer. We spent the day at Powerscourt Waterfall having recommended it by the reception team, it really is well worth the visit as you can get right up close to the waterfall. We also got to use the  leisure centre which was relaxing there is a spa too but we did not get to use it on this occasion.  We had dinner in Sika Restaurant again the  staff were really attentive and the food is really worth the experience. We also visited Powerscourt Gardens and this is definitely worth a visit however if you are short on time, the grounds of the hotel are amazing especially the ""hidden garden""  This was my first time staying at Powerscourt Hotel and will definitely be back.    ",5,2021,08,05
217,"Lovely rooms, mixed quality service","We recently stayed at Powerscourt for two nights. While the rooms were great, the overall quality of service from the staff in the bars and restaurants really detracted from the experience.

We'd booked an afternoon tea on the day of our arrival for 4:30. It took 30-40 minutes for someone to take our order, and when I requested a vegetarian tea, I was told that the kitchen was closed, I should've put this in the reservation (despite not being prompted to do so), and they wouldn't be able to accommodate me. The food took ages to come out, and the bread on the sandwiches was dry - they'd clearly been sitting around. We had dinner in the Sally Gap restaurant in the evening, and the food was lovely, but overall the atmosphere felt like we were eating in a meeting room.

Breakfast on both days had very mixed service. We waited upwards of 30 mins for coffees each time, and as mentioned in other reviews, the pancakes do quite literally come with exactly 3 berries. Various elements, like toast,  were missing on each day, and we gave up trying to get them brought out.

On our second night, we had drinks in the Sugarloaf Lounge, and again, we waited upwards of 30 mins for a round of drinks (and one of them was the wrong thing). Dinner in the Sika restaurant was the standout - the food was lovely, and the service was finally on point.

Although the spa is technically a separate entity, I want to mention that they somehow lost our reservation, and we had to alter our plans to take other guests' cancellations. The treatments themselves were great, but this left something of a bad taste in our mouths, especially when I went to check in for my treatment and heard another group having the same experience.

Finally, when checking out, we requested that someone come for our bags in the Marriott app and didn't receive a response. We then tried ringing and also didn't get a response. I eventually had to go to the lobby and find someone with a luggage cart (they were very apologetic, but it was just another small thing that really shouldn't have happened).

While we had an enjoyable time, there were a lot of small experiences largely related to the service that could've made the trip smoother and less stressful. I didn't feel like ""lovely rooms"" justified the price of the trip.",3,2021,07,28
217,Good but not fabulous!,"We love this hotel and have stayed here many times. Usually we would award 5 stars… but on this occasion we are giving 4!!! 

The hotel and staff are amazing, rooms are spacious and luxurious, well equipped and spotlessly clean. 

However, there were a few niggles on this visit: the hot water in the shower and bath only ever reached lukewarm: the TV in the bathroom did not work: the plug in one of the sinks could not be removed and there was stagnant water in the sink (this was fixed during our stay): the hair dyer lead was very short and did not stretch to a mirror: The Sally Gap restaurant was disappointing - it was obviously an overflow space and lacked atmosphere and the menu variety was limited and expensive:at breakfast only half a cup of coffee was initially poured by the server and no top-up or pot of coffee was subsequently offered….

These are all only very minor inconveniences (and the positives of our stay far outweighed the negatives) but they are inconveniences none the less and all easily remedied.",4,2021,07,28
217,Not a 5 star experience!,"We recently stayed in Powerscourt for 2 nights and expected a far better experience. This was our second time staying there and we were so disappointed this time.
Our room was lovely, dinner at The Sika restaurant was excellent but other issues we encountered were not.
Breakfast in both the Sika and Sugarloaf Lounge left SO much to be desired! We were left waiting 40 minutes on the first morning for a first cup of tea, coffee and toast even though we had asked four different staff members for same. There was only one cup on the table and we also had to request teaspoons on the second morning. The cooked breakfast was tepid at best and presented very poorly and largely inedible. An order of pancakes and fresh fruit consisted of a stack of. There pancakes with half a strawberry on top and THREE blueberries on the plate! I have since read a similar review of the pancakes from a few months ago so nothing much has changed.
On our first evening there was a power cut for a while, followed by no running water in our room to have a shower. This was rectified after some time  but no apology was given.
There were no disinfectant wipes as stated in our room and the safe did not work.
We were offered the opportunity to speak to the Food and Beverage Manager on departure but when requested he was unavailable. A follow up email from this man would give me no confidence that the above issues will be rectified and cannot see us returning to this hotel.",2,2021,07,28
217,Impeccable hotel and service.,"Amazing hotel, amazing staff. Can't wait to go back. The hotel is just beautiful and the staff are so friendly and offer impeccable service. Can't fault anything, and any covid restrictions were handled sensitively and safely. Food was lovely and bar area very welcoming. ",5,2021,07,26
217,Family Staycation,"Just a quick review about this amazing hotel. Felt 5* from the moment we arrived. Room was spacious and airy, the beds comfy and the bathroom was sensational. 

We visited the pool numerous times and it was spotless. Very well equipped gym on site and with the powerscourt gardens so close and Avoca on site there you wouldn’t need to leave at all. We did however take a spin to the local Enniskerry village to see the set of the new Disney movie. 

The staff are so well presented, friendly and accommodating with Ben from McGills bar the best of them all. 

Hopefully we will return someday.",5,2021,07,25
217,My Wife’s 40th Birthday,"On the 19th of August 2020 we visited the Sika restaurant in the Powerscourt hotel. I had pre-booked this for my wife’s 40th birthday. We had been married in Powerscourt and it was a dream day with weather and service etc. So my wife is as one would expect emotionally attached to the hotel.

The Reception Received:

We arrived promptly within 15 minutes of our booking, I went and parked the car and my wife and two daughters went down to Sika. When I got there my family were seated at a table that had debris from the previous diners (not five star). My wife was refused instructed sit there!!!. The restaurant was filthy and the staff were rushed and unfocused on the guests. So poor to say the least.

The Food:

The food was ok, we had eaten better in this establishment on past visits.

Huge Fop-as:

When booking the table I had informed the hotel that it was my wife’s 40th birthday and requested a happy birthday plate (takes two minutes, I know I am a chef). This never happened and there was no acknowledgement of my wife’s birthday whatsoever. We had never experienced such a poor reception in our 7 year relationship with the hotel. 

The only other gripe from previous occasions was the South African restaurant manager which I will explain a separate review.

Such a pity, we love this hotel and it’s surroundings.

217,Wouldn’t recommend,"Stayed at the powerscourt for two nights last week. The hotel itself was amazing. Rooms are large, extremely clean and stunning. 

The overall experience was disappointing. It was gorgeous weather and we couldn’t enjoy a meal or a drink outside on the hotel grounds, everything was inside. The views are amazing from this hotel and the outside space is not being used to its full potential. 

We went to sally gap restaurant in the hotel and it was very underwhelming. It seemed to be the overflow space and was not allowed to order a pint of beer in here only bottles. A bottle of Heineken was €6.50. All we wanted was a steak dinner but it was not possible, they only served burgers and chips. Menu needs expanding. 

We enjoyed  the river walk on the grounds.

We also had to give a 200 euro deposit for the hotel room…pretty ridiculous after paying over €800 two nights (room was paid before stay).

The breakfast was awful, not eatable. Porridge was lumpy and salty & the bacon was undercooked.

Staff were lovely. 

For a five star hotel, we expected better. The food quality was very low, lacked atmosphere and charm.

Thanks",2,2021,07,23
217,The highs and lows of Powercourt,"This was our first hotel experience since March 2020 Lockdown. It was our anniversary weekend and we had mixed emotions going away with covid. Initial booking and responses via email were excellent.  
On our journey up (about an hour from arriving at hotel) we received a call to say due to sickness our 4pm scheduled massage needed rescheduling with one at 4pm and one at 5pm. We decided to cancel the massage. 
Checking was from 4pm onwards. When arrived there was a queue on both sides of reception and we had a long wait to get checked in. Also we were very close to other guests trying to check in at the counter( out of 2 meter distancing)  the lady was friendly on check in but found it difficult to understand what we were saying because of masks, screens abs so many other guests all trying to check in. 
The room was fantastic - well appointed with lovely bacon and view over the fountain. It was clean and very comfortable … very happy.  After a short while we were brought chocolate for our anniversary. Lovely surprise. 
Prior to dinner we decided to have a drink in sugar loaf bar area. Staff looked after us and distancing was evident. However my husband ordered a lager. On arrival it came with a glass with ice. He called the waiter and explained he was surprised it had ice. The waiter said many people like ice in their lager. Maybe ask first ! 
Dinner was in sika restaurant - excellent food, good service gorgeous view. Sat outside as weather perfect. We even had a little cake brought with a happy anniversary. Thank you. 
In room dining for breakfast … arrived on time and was delicious - however no milk for coffee and had to ring down. 
Hotel is in superb grounds next to Powercourt house and gardens spent most of the day there and had lovely walks along the river and into enniskerry village. 
Second evening we went to sally gap restaurant! On arrival I was disappointed with look of restaurant. Sorry to say it reminded me of my fathers nursing home restaurant! The manager who welcomed us was lovely and very attentive.  
Our table on next to the walk way with staff dashing 
backwards and forwards some staff seemed to be struggling with their masks and kept touching them - not great to see when they are handling food. One waiter even had their mask resting below their nose. They all seemed  willing and friendly but lacked finesse and training!  The level of staff expertise seemed on a par to my local beefeater restaurant! 
On our final morning we had room service for breakfast again. Our fresh fruit was missing, so we called down. Then we saw we had no spoons so rang down again for that. In the meantime our porridge was waiting. When the fruit and spoons  arrived - it was apparent only one bowl of fruit had arrived so the waiter had to come back again with another bowl. She was apologetic. 
On check out we were asked how our stay was. My husband said - it was ok - the receptionist looked at him but didn’t question him further. 
This is a long review. To summarise. The hotel, room, location and quality of food is very good. Sadly we did not receive 5 star service. We felt although staff are enthusiastic they need training up.",4,2021,07,21
217,"Simply, one of the most beautiful hotels in Ireland","Myself and herself received a vouched to celebrate her special Birthday. We received a warm and pleasant welcome from the excellent staff and were shown to our room or should I say apartment. This spacious 4 room accommodation was stylish and spotlessly clean. The Aircon was a most welcome feature as the outside temp was 29c. The bed was the most comfortable we have slept in for years.
The staff in the Sika restaurant and the Sugar Loaf bar were friendly and welcoming. The food was of a decent standard but there was a shortage of vegetables on each plate. The beef was excellent and arrived as requested.
Breakfast was slow to arrive but was well worth waiting for. Whilst Covid protocols were in place, they were not invasive 
Thanks for the lovely stay. We’ll be back",5,2021,07,21
217,Outstanding,"We booked a two-night stay and our expectations were met! This hotel is enchanting and delightful. The bedroom was spacious, clean and the decor was beautiful, not to mention the spectacular view from our window of mountains and trees! 
The food and service were excellent and the team members are pleasant, helpful and it's clear to see that the management in this organization is mentoring the staff well and doing an exceptional job.  Nothing was too much trouble and we got excellent advice and service from front office on places to visit during our stay.

217,Family vacation,"Beautiful hotel, fabulous surroundings, staff very helpful.. but the food is where improvements are needed.. the Sally Gap restaurant is like sitting in a large dated sitting room with net curtains.. 🙄 menu choice is very poor and completely overpriced for very mediocre food.. when I see salmon on a menu for €26 🤢 and chicken wings in a small bowl no water to sanitise your hands no plates to put excess on.. small fizzy drinks served with no ice .. definitely improvements are needed in the food area.. we went to the bar to eat but had to leave as the smell of fish was awful.. like fishy fishy smell not in a good way.. 🤮food is this hotels let down.. menus are lazy relatively easy to prepare at inflated prices that you don’t mind paying if it is worth it.. breakfast good!",4,2021,07,19
217,Cole,"The site and location of the Hotel is beautiful and the rooms a good size but the food is really very very poor. We ate at the Sally Gap restaurant. What a limited poor menu. They should be embarrassed of it. It was glorified diner food at triple the prices.a horrible sloppy burger, destroyed with very very sweet onion jam (Describes as caramelised onions which they certainly were not!), was €22 and a starter beef and noodle salad €20.....
€20 for a basic starter. ice cream selection €9.00 and they had TWO flavours. Chocolate and vanilla. Really rubbish lazy effort and not good enough from a 5* hotel. I think there were five main courses and two were burgers, two veggie options and salmon as the fish course (yawn).  
I was a bit surprised if not shocked at the menu. Lazy average to below average pub grub.    We had drink beforehand in the lobby. Very inflated prices as if often the case in a five star hotel but you don’t mind because the experience is nice. Not here. Kids drinks were not chilled and no crisps or nuts with the drinks and when a cocktail is €17 and a tiny bottle of warm coke (half a glass) is €4.00, you would expect in a nice hotel that a small bar style nibble would be served. It is just so basic and you feel ripped off as a consequence. We stay at a lot of expensive hotels, so cost is not the point but this place doesn’t want to impress. The hotel was full and they don’t feel the need to bother clearly. It leaves a bad taste (like the horrid burger!).",2,2021,07,18
217,Worth every penny !!,"My friend and I stayed in this hotel last week for one night. It really is worth every penny. From the moment we arrived we felt extremely welcomed, comfortable and looked after. The breakfast was amazing and the breakfast staff really went out of there way to make sure we were happy! If you want a luxury getaway I would definitely recommend this hotel. You can walk to powerscourt gardens which are beautiful.",5,2021,07,17
217,Best hotel in Ireland,"We already visited the hotel twice (2 couples)! Both times were amazing. Staff are super helpful. The food was great. The entire area is beautiful and the spa area is amazing. Yes, it's expensive, but I would recommend to stay there at least once in your life! I would definitely come back for the third time!",5,2021,07,14
217,Amazing,"The hotel is completely amazing. Could not fault the staff, food, surroundings, cleanliness or anything at all. Every little detail has been thought about and it makes for a truly wonderful stay. Really couldn’t ask for more.",5,2021,07,10
217,"""Pre-authorization"" €100 payment is a SCAM!","From the outset - I HAVE attempted to resolve this directly with the hotel prior to posting this review.
All too often we see hotels etc. say that nowadays people dont allow them any opportunity to resolve an issue before posting a bad review - well this is why, because when Powerscourt were given the opportunity they quite literally ignored it.
I was part of a very large group staying at the hotel 8 days ago. We booked approx 8-10 suites, had approx 16 people for 3 course dinner with Powerscourt and racked up a big bar tab. We spent thousands, one 1 single night.
At check-in, all rooms were advised that their cards would be used for a ""pre-authorization"" payment of €100, simply to cover any issues in the room. Thats pretty normal for hotels. However, 1 specific girl who was a trainee at check-in didnt only set a pre-authorization, but she actually put through a €100 transaction on the card of anybody who she checked in. I had watched 2 of my colleagues be checked in right before me by other members of staff and they had NOT been told to put their pin number into the card reader. However, when the trainee checked me in, I was told that I had to do this. I advised that she already took my card details off me a moment previously and also said ""are you sure, because the others in front of me didnt have to"" - she explained that it was normal practice and the payment would simply disappear within a few business days if there was no issues in the room. 
That evening it became evident that 3 members of our group were told the same thing by this girl, whilst all others were not.
I have patients waited over 1 week and eventually called my bank yesterday. They advised that they cannot see any ""pre authorization"", but a transaction of €100 was put through.
I called Powerscourt this morning and got through to the ""Powerscourt switchboard"". I explained the situation to the girl on the phone - no apology! Not even something as simple as ""Im sorry to hear of this""...I was told ""Ok Im going to take your name and mobile number and get a manager to call you back to hopefully sort this - How reassuring to hear that a manager can ""hopefully"" arrange for the return of the money that Powerscourt had no permission to completely transact.
Ive waited all day for resolution and not got any contact back from Powerscourt.
3 of our rooms are in this situation now!
The ""pre authorization"" is either a scam or Powerscourt are unwilling to step in and resolve an issue when their own under trained employee makes a serious error. 
This will certainly cost Powerscourt far more than several hundred euro in the lost business as a result.
Absolutely 100% avoid!

I note that Powerscourt reply to all bad reviews on here - Prior to replying to me and advising me to ""contact you"" - perhaps get your own house in order and contact your annoyed clients who are out of pocket and attempt to resolve this with you before it gets to this stage!",1,2021,07,10
217,Not great,"Beautiful Hotel from the outside plus gardens are nice. Room was disappointing dated and old not suitable for small Children. I did the falconry experience which I booked for Myself and 6 year old daughter, my partner was walking the grounds nearby with my one year old daughter, upon leaving they tried to charge us for 4 people falconry 264.00 as if anyone in the right mind bring a one year old to falconry.  
I found this cynical, greedy and unnecessary. I argued this and to be fair reluctantly they refunded me half the cost. The food in the bar and sugar loaf lounge is no better than what you would get in most pubs at half the price.. You would certainly expect more from a 5 star hotel.  Breakfast was good service was good.  Overall I would not recommend 5 star in name only.",3,2021,07,08
217,Buyer beware - Check Confirmation Email,"I recently booked a two night stay there for July  - it was at a rate of €646 (€323 per night) for the two nights on Booking.com - I called the hotel directly and was told I would receive a call back - I was called back and when I enquired with dates etc - the lady told me she could offer me the two nights B&B for €700 - I decided to just book - we finalised details and I gave her my card for booking and was told I could cancel at up to 72hrs notice - I checked the confirmation email that night and I was charged €1400 - double the agreed rate - I often don’t check confirmation emails so was relieved I had as if I had noticed only a day or two before I believe I would have had no option but to pay the ridiculous rate as my card details were used to book - I contacted the hotel immediately but nobody from reservations was working, so I left my details and subsequently I received a call the next day - the lady who originally took the booking called and I explained the situation - she apologised for the “small error” - I didn’t believe it was small as I could have easily be landed with a €1400 bill had I not checked the confirmation email - I told her to cancel booking altogether and I booked Wineport Lodge instead - An error like that didn’t inspire me with confidence for a relaxing stay",1,2021,07,04
217,Top notch!,"We stayed here to celebrate our 10 yr anniversary, and it was top notch. We got a mountain view room. Room 604 had great views, a nice balcony and was very big.  The bathroom was also large and luxurious.

The front desk team and concierge were on their A game (shout out to Liam, Ava and Lezette).  The breakfast was lovely, as was dinner in the Sika restaurant.  The sugar loaf lounge was busy in the evenings, and had a nice vibe.  Highly recommended.",5,2021,07,04
217,Outstanding Experience from a Cancer Patient on Chemotherapy,"I felt it was essential to write a review. I am 36 and was diagnosed with stage 4 colon cancer in January. I was a fit, healthy, normal young woman then my life turned upside down. I shared this news with Powerscourt to ensure my very first trip away whilst still on Chemotherapy is relaxing and I am looked after. I also worked in a 5 star hotel until pandemic so I am very aware of the pressures the staff are under. So I have to say I was blown away by the service. They provided complimentary services to me but most importantly Gabriel in Sika Restaurant treated us like Royalty. I moved table if I felt a breeze and nothing was a bother. We had  our dessert with Chloe in the Sugarloaf lounge and she was genuinely fantastic. A kind and natual warmth not fake ""5 star"" talk. Our room was stunning, breakfast was delicious with Anna, treatment was by a very experience therapist in the Spa. With my surgery I have been left with a stoma bag and so I thought I can't lie on my tummy for a back massage. The therapist in Powerscourt gave me the confidence that it is OK to lie on my tummy. This is fantastic as now I can receive lots of massages. I wore a swimsuit for the first time since my surgery and the pool was so beautiful, clean and relaxing. Exactly what the doctor ordered. The host of the Sugarloaf lounge (I don't have his name) was brilliant. Great sense of humour! Conceirge were so friendly and welcoming! The food was excellent that I had 3 chocolate spheres during our 2 day stay haha. Thank you again for really looking after me! You've no idea what it meant to me!",5,2021,07,01
217,Amazing second stay,"This was our second stay in Powerscourt Hotel. From start to finish it was amazing. The hotel was immaculate and all staff were so friendly. We were upgraded to a superior room with a gorgeous balcony overlooking the gardens. The rooms alone are a reason to stay in the hotel. Every last detail of the room was gorgeous! The covid precautions in the hotel are all 100% from hand sanitisers all over the hotel to wipes & sanitisers available in all rooms. We ate in the bar and the young barmen were so friendly and made us feel so comfortable and right at home. One young barman in particular really went the extra mile and helped us select drinks & cocktails. 
One recommendation i would love implemented in the hotel is an earlier check in time. The check in time is 4pm so it’s quite late to get sorted in the room and ready for dinner. But overall the hotel is outstanding & you will not be disappointed! Can’t wait to return!!",5,2021,06,29
217,Excellent visit,Enjoyed an overnight stay last Saturday night in a suite with my daughter and daughter in law.  We had our spa treatments on Sat morning before check in and my Therapist Emma can be highly recommended for her massage and facial. Food at lunch and McGills was very tasty well served fresh and hot. We found the staff in all areas very professional and courteous. Great to see some normality returning hopefully we will have a return visit before end of year. ,5,2021,06,22
217,Superb stay,"This was a fantastic stay.   The staff were friendly and very efficient, the rooms were exceptionally nice, Covid precautions were excellent and the food was good. We were lucky enough to be able to sit outside for dinner, with an amazing view across the valley to the Sugarloaf mountain. Wine was delivered to our room, when ordered.l, in well under five minutes. 

We can’t wait to go back!",5,2021,06,17
217,Fabulous long week-end stay,"Fabulous long week end stay

The hotel is fabulous with spacious, comfortable rooms. Wonderful view from the lounges and restaurants. Access to the beautiful garden. Staff very helpful and welcoming. The only point I would like to make is that the menu from the Sugar loaf lounge and the sika restaurant for lunch are pretty similar, and not a five star menu either. Breakfast a bit disappointing though. Mc gills pub is a bit different but still the same spirit. Would recommend a stay at this hotel though. Will come back again",4,2021,06,15
217,Fantastic Stay,"My wife and I stayed in this hotel in June 2021.
We had lunch and dinner in Sika Restaurant which we booked prior to our arrival. We had lunch out on the terrace overlooking the immaculate gardens. The food was lovely and the service was excellent on both occasions.

McGills Pub was only serving customers having dinner there prior to 9pm so we had pre-dinner drinks in the Sugar Loaf Lounge which had great views. 

The bedroom was spacious with a king size bed which was very comfy. Our bedroom was very quiet and we didn't hear any noise during the night. The bathroom had a large bath and separate walk in shower. 

Breakfast was great and hot food was ordered from a menu. Pastries, cereals, yoghurts, fruits and juices were available for self service.

The staff were very friendly and the hotel was spotless. There was appropriate distance between tables. We thoroughly enjoyed our stay.
",5,2021,06,15
217,Amazing night away,"I can't say enough positive things about this hotel. We got an upgrade at check in to a suite which was absolutely gorgeous with a private balcony. The rooms were spotless and the bed was extremely comfortable. 
Dinner in Sika was amazing and cocktails on the terrace, with a view of the sugarloaf after, was a great end to the day with the amazing weather. All the staff were extremely friendly. We booked in for a swim which was great as there was not too many guests there at one time. Massages in Espa before we checked out was the perfect way to finish our stay. The thermal suites and relaxation room we're both lovely with incredible view. Can't wait for my next visit!",5,2021,06,10
217,So Happy To See They've Modernised the Menu,"The last time I stayed here I made a recommendation that they modernize the in-room dining menu to reflect the changes in people's healthier appetites... and they did! Great to see that they now offer vegetarian, vegan and low carb options.

The rooms are as beautiful as ever and the beds are soo comfortable. 

The place was super peaceful.

Only gripe was the availability for massages in Espa. Maybe they should start having a masseuse who accommodates guests only.",4,2021,06,08
217,Black Friday deal not being honoured,"I have yet to take up the Black Friday deal I paid and booked due to COVID restrictions. Originally booked for March. The hotel is now unwilling to honour it, and has issued a refund in spite of me asking to rebook. I was offered a date but was told I would have to pay a supplement. Given the fact that restrictions mean the rebooking is enforced I thought that good customer service would mean honouring what I bought without any supplements? Refund issued as soon as I looked for the complaints procedure. Anyone else having the same issue?",1,2021,03,01
217,"Hotel has changed, so disappointed so changed my original review","I have stayed at this hotel many times and i have had some great memories. The past 2 visits have been shockingly awful since the new owners have taken over. Since our last stay the price for upgrading to the normal suite had multiplied by 5 times the normal supplement charge from our previous stay which was 11 months earlier. We planned to stay on christmas eve and christmas day so we prepared for the new cost and also the christmad charge too, specifically discussing all our options of what our expectations where before agreeing to our christmas holiday with the hotel. (€2100 cost). We expected the same room and service as our previous visit regardless of the new pricing.
Prepared for the price but certainly did not prepare for the amount of problems that occured. I stood in this hotels lobby on christmas eve in tears with the amount of issues we had (cold room, broken heating, broken tv, wrong room to name a few)
I would never post anything like this online however as per the response i have received from management and ample opportunity and flexibility to resolve the matter i am shocked at the hotels ignorance to me as a valued customer. A plan from them was to escalate further (still no response) so i now i feel i should warn others especially as i was a potential bride for this hotel.
The etiquette is not 5 star. The resolution skills are not 5 star. I do believe from nearly all reservation and management staff that the hotel are trying to match other 5 star hotels. How that normally works is to start with the customer.
Very very disappointed at this hotel and kindly ask for an appropiate staff member with the skills to resolute to contact me.",1,2021,02,03
217,If I Could Live Here I Would,"We traveled here in July 2019 and this hotel was perfection.  The grounds, the rooms, the food.  We asked for an upgrade to a room with a balcony and let me say, I was BLOWN away.  I wish I could recall the room number as I would request it again if going back. It was a stunning room with a HUGE balcony, we had a living room, a kitchen a bedroom and of course a bathroom.  If we have the opportunity to go back, I would have to save up to stay for more than 2 nights.  The town center is also just the most perfect quaint Irish experience.  If you want to spoil yourself accommodation wise, this is the place to do it.",5,2021,01,14
217,Luxurious family retreat at Powerscourt Hotel,"We enjoyed a luxurious 2 night stay at Powerscourt Hotel Dec 22 and 23 2020. We were welcomed on arrival with festive cheer from all the staff. The foyer was beautifully decorated and we were transported immediately into the Christmas holiday spirit. Our rooms had a stunning view of manicured gardens overlooked by the Wicklow mountains. Beds were so comfortable, bathrooms spacious and toasty warm. We were in heaven! Dinner on both nights was delicious. Our first night in the Bar and the second night in the Sika restaurant. Staff were courteous and under the current Covid restrictions they were incredibly patient, pleasant and diligent. We also
enjoyed Breakfast with breathtaking views of the surrounding gardens and mountains. 
One of the highlights of our stay was a 2 hour family walk through the Powerscourt Estate woods. We were transported to another time snd place and returned to the hotel totally refreshed. A swim and jacuzzi was another treat to enjoy before our delicious dinner after which we retreated to the foyer for a night cap in the sugar loaf lounge and then a family movie in our super comfortable room. Before leaving for home we walked from the hotel to the Avoca store which is in Powerscourt House (the cafe/restaurant overlooks the Powerscourt gardens), where we stocked up on last minute presents and supplies to celebrate our own Christmas Day at home.  Next time we visit we’ll make time to visit the distillery and also the garden centre. Also might bring golf clubs snd play a round of golf ! Can hardly wait to visit again. We Loved our stay.",5,2021,01,12
217,Powerscourt at Christmas and COVID,"The highlight at Powerscourt was the food - simply fab - staff did their best within the restaurant to make this a fabulous experience and so it was . the worst was the sheer ignorance in the Golf Club - trying to pass you off with a lie just to get rid of you when you questioned the price as there were other people behind you - simply disgraceful.

COVID had a huge impact and the hotel did its level best to make all people comfortably- however when it came to the spa this did not work - trying to get a booking was impossible and the staff on the desk were not good enough - couldn’t explain the system simply - 

The whiskey tasting did not work - you were not allowed to book and the queue went on for ever to get in - we simply gave up 

We choose a balcony room - expecting a lovely view over the mountains - not so - the look at the car park was best in a very cold 3 days - balcony’s are not worth it as also it’s north facing and not worth the additional price 

The rooms were very good very well cleaned - however the hand showers given the grading of the hotel could have had a lot more power in them - 

There was a huge level of staff on all busy busy - the standard of staff was well trained and all friendly 

To finish on a funny note - my wife asked the receptionist as to whether there was any earriing dropped in and trying to be pleasant without properly listening to the question says “ sorry I wasn’t on last night 😂😂”

Given the price we paid I would think twice at returning at Christmas though the adult kids really enjoyed it “ of course “ - the box has now been ticked",4,2020,12,28
217,Didn't meet expectations,"2* food and service in a 5* building. Perhaps covid shutdowns has had an impact but didn't live up to what I would expect at 5* or have experienced at other hotels of similar rating in ireland

2 night couple break December 2020.

Excellent

- Housekeeping, friendly and excellent
- Grounds
-Location
-Pool

Disappointing
- Sikka restaurant - Starters had been prepared well in advance ( goats cheese , soggy pastry)  and monkfish that even my partners steak knife couldn't better - food that I would have been disappointed with in my local gastro pub. Partners steak was closer to well than medium. 
- No one questioning why a full plate of food went back uneaten.( Didn't complain at the time because 1 - no one asked if it was ok and 2 I didn't think any one would care) 
-seated beside the staff cutlery station, noisy , talking among them selves etc
- taking of order with tablet , server never made any eye contact. 
- Non Alcoholic drink selection - Despite a huge cocktail list, which could easily be adapted to mock-tails , there was a choice of 2 0% alcohol free beers, and one gin. No NA wines by glass, ciders, etc was disappointing as pregnant and had hoped the range might be better. 
- Inattentive staff, at breakfast was seated facing into glaring sunlight in the lounge, request for bacon with pancakes instead of fruit didn't happen, walking past empty coffee cups on our table no refill offers.No offer of toast at breakfast on day one, my husband ate his full irish without. 
- At both breakfast and in the bar myself and other guests had to leave seats to intercept staff for additional orders or help. 
- Room drinks service - Ordered a pint for my husband ( nothing for my self as the non alcoholic choices didn't appeal) couldn't get through to in room dining, reception took my order to ""is that it , can i add anything to it "" ? after 40 mins when it hadn't arrived i called again to check and it eventually arrived after 10 more mins. 
Overall it felt like the waiting staff were poorly trained, a little out of their depth, and the food was just OK , but given the limited continental breakfast bread/pastry selection ( pre wrapped mini crossant & mini choc croissant) it was disappointing that the slight variation requestedvwas ignored. 

Overall my impressions is lovely place building and location wise and perhaps we just got unlucky due to covid closures but not somewhere Id have any interest in returning to.",3,2020,12,21
217,Highly recommended ,"10/10 for this amazing hotel. Christmas decorations were so festive they really added to the atmosphere at this time of year. Food delicious, beds SO comfortable and service excellent. I had a full body massage in Spa and it was best I ever had (a big ‘thank you’ to Rachael in the Spa👍). 
Stunning location too. Can’t wait to return. ",5,2020,12,21
217,Fantastic Family Break,"The Kids and I booked a 2 night break as a surprise birthday present for my wife. We had a great time, from check in to leaving the staff could not have been any more pleasant and professional, in all areas of this magnificent hotel. The rooms were fantastic, food was wonderful, the 3 girls had a magnificent experience in the Spa whilst the 3 boys enjoyed the cycle ride around the Forest walk. We topped it off with some swimming, a visit to Powerscourt House & Gardens and a tour of  the superb Powerscourt Distillery. I would  highly recommend a visit to the Distillery. Overall, we had a wonderful time and look forward to returning in the future. A big thank you and Happy Christmas to all the staff who facilitated this fantastic trip during the most difficult of times. 😀👍",5,2020,12,20
217,"Lovely rest, very comfortable and lovely walkways","This is a superb hotel, although a little pricey. Very warm and comfortable with very friendly and helpful staff.  Great Christmas atmosphere. Lovely large bedrooms and ensuite bathrooms.  Breakfast is delicious. Evening dinner in the Sika restaurant was good, but not excellent, and over-priced at 60 euro per person. A request for some tartar sauce or peppered sauce was turned down - ""not available"". There is much better value and tastier food available in the bar. It was a lovely relaxing stay, with Covid-19 restrictions very well managed. Great opportunity to go walkabout through the woods and demesne and bikes can be rented for free. Will return.",4,2020,12,12
217,Magnificent stay,"Myself and my boyfriend stayed for two nights during the week. The hotel's setting and scenery are amazing. Ava who checked us in was so warm and welcoming and informed us that our room had been upgraded to a beautiful suite overlooking the gardens. Our room was huge and luxurious with a massive balcony with a gorgeous view. We had breakfast both mornings which was lovely. We went to the spa pool and jacuzzi in the mornings and evenings and it was so relaxing and serene and unlike any other spa I've been to before. We had dinner in the Sika restaurant on our second night and the service was outstanding, aswell as the food! Boyfriend said it was the best meal he's ever had. We had room service the first night which was also lovely and delivered promptly. We booked a horse riding trek with the hotel for one of the days which was at Brennanstown Riding School around 10 mins down the road. I'd highly recommend it, we had a great time ! We were made to feel so special during our whole stay from start to finish it was a magnificent experience and a stay I'll never forget and we can't wait to go back. Thanks to all !",5,2020,10,21
217,Relaxing Autumn Weekend,"Incredible location and grounds. We stayed in a superior room which was worth the upgrade. Highlight of the weekend was the pool and spa facilities. I got a spa treatment (Sweedish body massage 1hr) from Una which was honestly the best massage I have ever had. We walked the gardens after this and I was never so relaxed in my life. I would highly recommend. Thanks Una!

The hotel provides bikes for guests to explore the grounds, we headed down to the river walk on these which was beautiful and took approx. 1 hr there and back going slow and taking photos. Note, you will have to get off the bike coming back up the hill! 

Great weekend and would highly recommend.",4,2020,10,21
217,Special family stay,Cannot recommend Powerscourt enough for a family stay. The staff are so friendly and helpful and so tolerant of children. There's plenty to do in the area with children including a lovely playground on the grounds of the hotel. They went above and beyond for us and I highly recommend the hotel for family breaks and would also be amazing for a couples break or a break with friends or solo!,5,2020,10,20
217,Wonderful stay!,"Booked  online but followed this up with a phone call to  reservations.In order to book spa & meal times. Spoke with a most delightful young lady Lezette who as a first point of contact with the hotel set a very high standard of the customer service to come! We were not disappointed in this regard as all staff were extremely polite, helpful & professional. The spa area was very clean. & well maintained with limited numbers at all times. I would agree with a previous reviewer that €5 for a cup of coffee is rather steep & as someone who adores their coffee, did not particularly rate it. Dinner in the Sika restaurant was wonderful. After a shaky start i.e. the menu had been changed the previous evening hence the much anticipated cod was no longer available, my daughter reluctantly opted for the monkfish....it was absolutely delicious as was my chicken dish. The only small quibble was with the rather hard bread rolls & the over salted chips!  The additional paprika added to the overall flavour but the level of salt almost rendered them inedible! Starters & desserts were both on point. Our waiter...a Spanish guy(apologies as I didn’t get his name) was fantastic & guided us with an excellent wine choice. As this was a birthday treat from my daughter, we were very kindly given two glasses of sparkling wine plus a beautifully present camaroon biscuit with a candle on top. A really lovely touch which was most appreciated. Breakfast however was a little disappointing & underwhelming....difficult to deliver a normal service in the current very challenging times.....overall a really lovely stay thank you!",5,2020,10,20
217,Extravagant Treat,"We stayed, dinned and relaxed in the Leisure center, what a treat to unwind just before the lock down kicked in.

The room was exquisite .as we received a complimentary upgrade to a Mountain View room with spectacular views of the Sugar Loaf, the food was superb and the ambience unparalleled.

It was such a relaxed night away ticking all the boxes!

For that extra touch, please stock the mini bar in the room, it would add that extra!

My only small tiny complaint was the afternoon tea which we booked and had on arrival at €45 per person , even though you are loaded, no tea is worth nearly €50.

Thank you to all the amazing friendly and professional staff that added to our experience.",4,2020,10,19
217,Absolutely gorgeous,"Stayed recently in a fabulous triple room with my friends for one night. I have to say from start to finish the experience was fantastic. Highly professional and friendly staff, such a pleasure to deal with. The room was amazing, food stunning, pool and spa area fabulous and what a great hot tub. We will definitely return in the future.",5,2020,10,19
217,Stunning Hotel,"What a beautiful Hotel to relax , unwind and get Spoiled ! The staff are fantastic and really make your stay so welcoming.  Daniel was a pleasure to deal with when booking (thank you ) 
Carlos in Sika restaurant so friendly and a true wine expert if your looking for advice on a nice wine for dinner.  
The food is top class, best breakfast we have had in a long time.  
Maike was so lovely when we hired bikes to explore the beautiful grounds and garden.  Very knowledgeable of the area and guided us on our way.  Afternoon tea with bubbles is a lovely treat after a very enjoyable cycle. 
We both had treatments in the spa and omg the best I have ever had.  Zoe was my therapist and she was super.  When i complemented her she responded with ‘all the therapists are great ‘  very modest.  it’s the first time in a long time I actually switched off 💆🏽‍♀️
The room was unreal , bed a dream 
Every inch of the hotel is spotlessly clean.  Views to die for.  It really is like a high end retreat.  Can’t wait to return. 😁",5,2020,10,16
217,Beautiful Stay,We had a wonderful stay here for one night. Staff were absolutely brilliant...from the gentleman who first greeted us outside on the door to our checkout at the end I can't rate the staff more highly. Our room was just beautiful....the pool and spa amazing..and we had a fantastic breakfast. Thanks so much to all the hotel staff for a truly beautiful stay....can't wait to return! Also a huge thanks to Megan in the spa who booked our pool times in...she was fantastic and so helpful....and also to Marie who booked our accommodation for us....both such a credit to the hotel 😊,5,2020,10,16
217,Not quite the 5 star experience,"Just spent 3 nights at the hotel. We were only meant to spend 2 nights but stayed an extra night as we have not been away since Jan. 

Room:
- Absolutely loved the suite. Chocolates on arrival- which were absolutely devine -and bottles of water replenished everyday. I only wish they replenished the chocolates everyday!!

Spa and leisure:
-On the first day we both had treatments. Not worth the price at €125 each. I would search around the area as there are other spas close by with equally as good treatments and a fraction of the price.
-we visited the pool everyday and thoroughly enjoyed the experience. Only a few people were allowed at any one time, it felt very safe and staff were constantly cleaning.
-good gym with everything you need to get a decent workout in.

Food and beverages:
- The highlight for me everyday was breakfast. The choice was good and quality of food was excellent. Staff were friendly, quick to remediate any issues and very good at what they do!
-We ate in Mcgills the first night which was good, the lady who served us was very pleasant. No complaints!
- I am sorry to say the previous bad reviews of Sika are accurate. Both had the rib eye, both equally disappointed. The chips were over seasoned with way too much salt- barely edible. Selection of plain white rolls served with soup (it’s a 5 star-serve a decent selection of breads with your fancy soup). The only course we both enjoyed was the dessert. Again, staff excellent.
-Dinner in the sugarloaf lounge was disappointing. Ordered the wings as we enjoyed them in mcgills the first night. I had the curry for my main and it was not good- the sauce was like puréed baby food. 
- The alcohol is pricey but if your after a good cocktail I highly recommend the forgotten land! Worth the €15 IMO. I do not agree with the tea and coffee prices. Went down to Enniskerry to get my caffeine fix from a local cafe instead! 

Overall my partner enjoyed the experience more than I did. I am a foodie so I felt a little let down by the whole experience. We were just glad to get away! I will end the review by saying the staff are a credit to this hotel and is probably the main reason we would return! ",3,2020,10,14
217,Absolutely Fabulous ,"We kicked off our 9 night staycation around Ireland in Powerscourt hotel. We received a welcome drink on arrival and our bags were looked after while we got our room keys.The hotel and grounds itself are breathtaking. Plenty to do with your day including Japanese Gardens, golf, life size chess, whiskey tasting and a bike trek for guests and members which was a really great addition. Our room was on another level, pure luxury in every aspect. The staff are flawless and really complete the 5 star experience.They interacted with guests while maintaining the highest standard of service, you feel valued and welcomed. The food was fab with breakfast being a real highlight. We will definitely be back .",5,2020,10,10
217,Fabulous Hotel,"We booked Powerscourt at the very last minute for a 2 night staycation. 
The Hotel is absolutely gorgeous and really luxurious. The room was a standard room but it was really big and spacious with all the nice little extras that you would expect from a 5star hotel. The ESPA toiletries in the room are really nice and all the facilities were very well done. 
The bath in the room was fab.
The swimming pool and all that area are amazing. The nice loungers and spacious showers and especially the crystal sauna room area are all amazing. 
We had bar food on the first night and it was ok but we went to the main restaurant the second night and we were very disappointed with the food especially the very limited choice on the menu. Just not to our liking. The cocktails and wine list are both extensive and very well done. 
The staff can not be faulted and made our stay very enjoyable.  
Being able to walk to Powerscourt House and Gardens is an added bonus. Being in the heart of “The Garden of Ireland” was amazing for us.
We are already looking forward to our return.",5,2020,10,10
217,A perfect 24 hour staycation getaway,"I have two small children and I was treated to a night away by myself in this beautiful hotel, to rest and recharge, and honestly it was perfect. The staff everywhere, from the spa to the restaurant to the room service, couldn’t have been friendlier or more helpful. The spa treatment menu is reduced due to Covid but I got a treatment that incorporated a back massage, a mini facial and a scalp massage into the hour and I loved it, I much preferred it to spending the whole hour on a single treatment! The hotel feels very safe, there are sanitizer stands everywhere but there was still a friendly buzz about the place. I have stayed here with my husband in the past and I had wondered if I would feel strange on my own but it was wonderful, just what I needed. For anyone looking for a break from the world right now or a getaway to unwind I could not recommend more. Ideal for couples, friends and solo travellers/staycationers looking to treat themselves!",5,2020,10,07
217,1st Wedding Anniversary,"We spent 2 nights for our 1st wedding anniversary. From when we arrived, to checkout, the staff couldn’t do enough for us. 
The hotel is fab, spotless, and exudes luxury. 
The staff are amazing, especially Clea (reception), Jamie (Sika-dinner), and Trinity (Sika-breakfast).
The food blew us away. As vegans we usually have low expectations in order to avoid disappointment. We had THE best 3 course meal in Sika restaurant. It clearly showed thought and effort, plenty of choice, was filling & delicious. Breakfast was also a lovely surprise. The vegetarian breakfast is vegan (no eggs). I’m so glad more hotels are offering vegan sausages. We asked if any pastries were vegan. We got the usual answer that no they weren’t. However, Trinity, returned with a plate of sweet treats (flapjacks & choc tart) served with a selection of berries. This is 5* service! The only issue we had was in the bar. It’s the same vegan menu from Sika (fine dining), but we were after something more casual - curry/burger. A tweak to the menu in this regard would really make Powerscourt a vegan paradise.
You can do as little or as much as you want. The pool is relaxing & calming & we also used the hotel bikes to cycle around the estate, house and gardens. There are nice walks and the waterfall is a short drive. We also did the Greystones-Bray Cliff walk.
We don’t stay in hotels more than once as we like to try new places, but we would return to Powerscourt in a heartbeat. Thank you for a wonderful anniversary.",5,2020,10,07
217,Wedding anniversary ,"We treat ourselves every year for our anniversary and it is something we always really look forward to, just getting away together for some chill time. After saving and planning for our break and organising kids to be looked after by grandparents etc., it's such a let down to feel our time and money could have been spent so much better elsewhere. 

On arrival everything about this hotel is epic, from the drive in, to the scale of the building and fantastic lobby to the stunning views of the sugarloaf and magnificent grounds. 

The major let down is service and attention to detail, for us it didn't come close to a 5 star rating. We had two meals and two breakfasts and drinks both nights in the sugarloaf lounge. After the first few meals we considered there was an isolated issue or they were short staffed and gave them the benefit of the doubt. Unfortunately the service was consistent throughout our stay. There are too many faults to list but the general issues for the Sika restaurant are, difficulty in getting staffs attention, not the usual selection of fresh breads expected of a 5 star, coffee arriving 20 minutes after dessert is finished, food was no better than pub grub. On our second day we had lunch in the Irish bar and had no complaints, the lady (we presume is the manager) is very attentive with a spring in her step and has a great attitude. Then we come to breakfast, the first morning we tried the sugarloaf lounge and were so disappointed with everything, as were other guests, we saw one lady ask to have her breakfast reheated and after it was returned to her she checked temperature again and soon stood up and left. Guests have to frequently remind staff of their orders when they eventually get their attention,  a waitress wanders around with coffees/teas in large glorified lukewarm flasks, burnt toast comes long after breakfast is finished, no selection of home made soda breads or warm rolls. We have had so much better service from hotels with a supposedly lower rating. 

We still really enjoyed our stay and loved relaxing in the hotel and the surrounding landscape, we cycled through the woods along side the river and walked the grounds and all this is truly unique. It's just a shame the service is a slight stain on what could have been a lovely experience.

217,Stay at home!,"25th anniversary break. To keep it short, beautiful hotel, comfortable beds, helpful and friendly Concierge, food service as bad as it gets. Checked out after one night, we were supposed to stay another night, but went to another hotel. I can’t even describe service at breakfast, just stay at home and save your money. Lovely manager spoke to me at check out and discounted my breakfast, but left feeling really down and disappointed.",1,2020,10,04
217,Wonderful experience,"My fiancé and I stayed in the hotel on the 21st of September for 3 nights. We had such a wonderful  experience and came away relaxed. Upon arrival, I did the wellness experience with Zoe (I think). I woke myself up snoring, such was the relaxation I felt. She and indeed all the Espa staff were very kind and professional. Masks were worn everywhere & there was a ready supply of hand sanitizer.
We ate dinner in the restaurant that night. A beautiful experience. The staff checked in regularly, couldn’t do enough for us and the food was something else entirely. Again, we felt safe as all precautions were taken. The waiting staff were very friendly adding to the relaxed atmosphere.
The room was amazing, I could have stayed in that bed forever. It was like sleeping on clouds. All our needs were met, it was all so clean and comfortable.
The breakfast was a pleasant experience. Again all precautions were taken with pastries in packaging & juices individually bottled. I tried the eggs benedict and the fry whilst there. Couldn’t fault either.
We finished out our night in the McGill pub. I sampled a cocktail made up by Keith the bar manager. He took time to speak with us and suggested a Ferncullen whiskey for my fiancé. I sampled it, a lovely creamy taste (to my palette) and we ended up buying a bottle from the distillery before Heading home.
We, like everyone else, have had a tough year with bereavements, postponed wedding & working in healthcare. The break away in this beautiful setting was just what we needed. A sincere thanks to all the staff for giving us such pleasant memories.",5,2020,09,29
217,Fantastic,"I’m not sure how you could beat this place to be honest. My husband and I have traveled Ireland in many occasions and enjoyed different experiences in different locations but this is top of the the range. From the very start, Jeremy in reservations was a friendly voice who brought personality and person ability to the reservation process. He was excellent. He asked me if we were going for a special occasion and I advised it was to celebrate our anniversary. We were blown away when we arrived and everyone was lovely. We discovered when we walked into our room that we had been upgraded to a stunning mountain view suite as an extremely kind gesture for our anniversary. The suites are absolutely incredible and while they look beautiful on the website the pictures actually don’t do them justice even. Incredible experience! They even gave tv’s in the bathroom mirrors for when you are enjoying the luxurious bath! Everything about the stay was fantastic. We had drinks on the terrace when we arrived which was stunning. Dinner in the restaurant was lovely and Carlos looked after us so well. The sugarloaf lounge is also lovely for a drink with the piano player in the background in the evening. The pool was lovely , though a little cold, but the hot pool was perfect for me. The gym has everything you would need including a stunning view and separate stretching room. We rented bikes and toured around the estate. We did the gardens and house next door which was also stunning. We ate in the bar the second night and loved the cocktails. These guys are all over the covid regulations and health and safety and felt safe and secure in their care. My overall review is that if you fancy a treat this hotel and location is worth spending a little extra for a stunning overall experience. Would love to try Christmas here some time I think it would be stunning 💛💛💛",5,2020,09,28
217,Definitely not a 5 star hotel,"Upon arrival we prepaid cash for the full amount of our stay. We went for dinner in the Irish Bar on night one. Once our 1 hour and 45 minutes was up , we were told we would have to vacate the table as food customers were a priority, we asked for the bill. We had forgotten to bring our debit card and so we asked to put the dinner on the room, the staff member proceeded to shout across the room that we don't have any credit. Heads turned as we were repeatedly told 'you got no credit'. This left us feeling like a bunch of gangsters. We asked for an explanation as to why we could not charge dinner to our room, the staff member at that stage was having a meltdown and kept repeating you got no credit. We ended up paying cash after we suggested that ourselves, and left the venue with our remaining drinks embarrassed and disgruntled at the treatment we had received. When we checked in, we were not asked for a credit card as we had paid in full by cash. There was something very lacking about staff members in general, almost a robotic behavior about them , as if they were preprogrammed to treat guests with indifference. We found it difficult to communicate with them, often having to repeat. We felt we were more an inconvenience than a valued guest. On the second night, fine dining dinner left another bitter taste in our mouths as we were almost overcharged 100 euro , the deal being 1 dinner included + 2 nights stay which was already paid for, but the meal bill sadly did not reflect this and we had to get the assistance of senior staff member to get the situation rectified. We were disappointed by the overall experience in the hotel, the rooms and grounds are very very nice, it's just a pity that the staff members are not to the same standard. I would not be rushing back anytime soon.",1,2020,09,28
217,Fantastic hotel,This was a hotel on my wish list for a long time and it did not dissapoint. We stayed as a young family and the service made for an extremely comfortable stay. The reservation and front desk staff were a credit to the hotel. We thoroughly enjoyed our stay and cannot wait to return to this fabulous hotel!,5,2020,09,26
217,What a treat,Stayed here for two nights and it was so relaxing. We had a fabulous room with gorgeous views. Breakfast was very good and dinner in the Sika restaurant was heavenly. Didn't get to go the spa as it was fully booked so try book before you arrive. All Covid procedures in place,5,2020,09,25
217,Fabulous,"A true gem of a hotel with a character all its own .. country living in style and glamour . The interiors are superb and lots of lovely places to sit and watch the world from . The view of Sugar loaf mountain for certain locations is quite superb .. such a beatuiful view . 
The grounds are immaculate from the sunken gardens at entrance to the grand lawns on mountain side , Access to these though is rather vague .
Dining and breakfast was truly superb especially the breakfast .

Rooms were wonderful ,, only small snags . One window had the double glaze seal broken and looked a bit grim .The hairdryer had a very short cable which was not possible to use and see the mirror at same time ! needs a longer cable ..) 

All said though LOVED this hotel and can not wait to go back as the location as well as the hOTEL is beyond beautiful , true beauty .. x",5,2020,09,23
217,Excellent Experience ,"My grandmother and I visited this beautiful hotel in August on arrival we were greeted with a glass of bubbles, Ava on reception looked after us and nothing was to much trouble offering extra help with my grandmother she went above and beyond to help us she made us feel so welcome I can not thank her enough for making our stay so special. We had dinner in the exquisite Sika restaurant everything was perfect from service to our delicious meal, We had the most magnificent view from our room and we thoroughly enjoyed our stay. We will definitely be back soon.",5,2020,09,22
217,Appalling Customer Service,"Let me start by saying that the hotel interiors and location are lovely but have been completely let-down by the lack of customer service. I tried to resolve this matter directly with the hotel but to no avail.

Myself and partner booked to stay here on the day of what was supposed to be our wedding which was postponed due to Covid-19. We specifically called to organise the room as we wanted to get one with a balcony. There were two options; a mountain view room with the request of the balcony or a suite. As we were informed there was plenty of availability we went with the mountain view room and requested the balcony. No balcony on check-in to our room and after calling reception were informed there were no other rooms available - utter disappointment - what was the point in calling up to make the reservation! Next a bottle of champagne arrived to the room from friends - delivered on a trolley with 3 other bottles of champagne and felt in no way special and rather like tesco home delivery. We asked was there somewhere outside we could sit with the champagne (as we didn't have the balcony we requested) and were told we had to stay in our room and couldn't bring it to the benches outside. Naturally I became upset and asked that surely there was something that could be done! Meanwhile we went outside for a walk only to find several people drinking outside - clearly it wasn't a standard rule. Upon returning to our room we received a very hostile phone call ' I hear you want somewhere to drink your champagne' and finally we were advised we could drink it on the terrace which we said we would after dinner. Upon arriving for dinner we were greeted with 'I was under the impression you were bringing champagne', another unpleasant hostile remark.

Upon check-out the following morning we mentioned our issues and were assured someone would follow up with us during the week. The customer service in the following 4 weeks was disgraceful. I waited 2 weeks to hear from them and when I didn't I rang up to ask for an email address so I could follow up on our issues. I sent an email outlining all of the above and heard nothing. Another week passed and I called again to enquire if my email had been lost. 15 minutes later I get an email that thanked me for my feedback. I replied by saying that the email was completely unacceptable, why had I been ignored for 3 weeks and why was I now being fobbed off? 2 further emails have been exchanged with no resolution of our issues. I am shocked that this level of service is permitted from a 5 star resort. Their actions during our stay left us feeling disappointed and dejected and their customer service since has been deplorable.

Spend your hard earned money elsewhere, Powerscourt Hotel doesn't deserve it.",1,2020,09,22
217,A cancelled trip,My partner and I were due to stay in the Powerscourt hotel this week. Unfortunately I woke up unwell the morning of our trip. I contacted the staff at reservations who kindly cancelled our trip free of charge. They were empathetic and made the process very easy. The service was top class and made us even more excited to reschedule our stay. Unfortunately I did not remember the lady on the phones name but thank you for your help!,5,2020,09,19

217,Another super weekend,"Thank you so much for yet again another super weekend with ye. Although different from last year due to covid it was a great weekend away. Sanitising stations everywhere, masks worn by both staff and public.we did get to pool twice over the weekend. It is a pity that we are confined to 45min slots but understandably so everyone gets a chance to use it.

We ate in the sugar loaf lounge both times and were served by very polite staff who were very helpful to tweeking our orders for what we wanted.

Rooms were beautiful and perfectly kept. Thanks again for a great weekend.",5,2020,09,13
217,5 Star Hotel with 3 star food,"Powerscourt had been on my list of hotels to visit for some time and I was really excited after hearing such good reviews from friends, but I was so disappointed by the really awful food, it completely spoiled our stay. The hotel grounds are breath-taking and the hotel itself is wonderful, with nice rooms and facilities, but whoever is running their kitchens is missing the mark... It’s like they have no idea how to put together a meal. Firstly, I'll start with lunch in Sika, the staff were attentive, and the room is comfy with nice views but that is where it stops. I had the mozzarella and beef tomato salad which was meant to have fresh basil and balsamic dressing. When it came out, I could not believe my eyes, someone had quartered a full ball of fresh mozzarella, cut two of the thinnest slices of tomato and placed a handful of leaves that was drenched in pesto... It was one of the most thoughtless meals I've ever seen. Another member of our party had the Halloumi Spinach wrap... It was again a whole block of barely heated/cooked cheese in a wrap that had processed spinach through the actual wrap! It is mind boggling how a 5 star hotel does not have any quality control. These were very unbalanced, careless meals with 1 star presentation. 
For dinner we ate in the Sugar Loaf, my friend had fish and chips, the cod was old and had clearly been sitting in the freezer for too long... My prawns were also frozen, left on a bed of soggy wilted baby gem lettuce, I don't think there were fresh herbs or sesame seeds which were mentioned in the menu. They hadn’t even wiped the plate down before it came out. Dessert was better and the pavlova and lava cake were tasty and well presented.
Breakfast was a total fiasco of all proportions. I actually felt sorry for the waiting staff because they were trying their best and run off their feet. We queued outside for 15 minutes and then were seated, we put in our orders straight away and made our way to the buffet first. Everything was prepacked, the croissants were cheap processed ones, the granola and yogurt was edible, and the orange juice was fine, the only bread we received was a barely toasted white sliced pan. I am just so shocked that a hotel of this calibre don’t have freshly baked bread and goods. What do they actually spend their time prepping? Then we waited 45 minutes for our hot food!! Our poached eggs were well cooked but the bacon that came with mine had been sitting at the bottom of a bain-marie for far too long, the waffles were synthetic and either bought in or cooked the day before, they were served cold with 2 measly raspberries. It was just a really crap experience and the service staff are not too blame but whoever is in that kitchen has no respect or care for good food.
I know times are hard but it's not difficult to deliver simple, cost effective home cooked food..... I wouldn't cook food like that at home and I don't expect to pay €600/€700 (meals and accommodation) to eat food of that quality !!! It actually makes my blood boil.
Apart from the meals our experience was lovely, the pool was relaxing and clean (lots of towels and sanitiser) the spa was fabulous and I had one of the best back massages from a male therapist. We felt safe and they had all the right Covid measures put in place around the hotel, but it’s such a pity that a beautiful hotel is let down by their restaurants. All the staff that I delt with, waiters, therapists, receptionists and cleaners were really friendly and attentive. I would actually go back but I'd bring my own food next time.",3,2020,09,13
217,Fantastic Hotel and Staff,"Stayed here in July with my Mum and Nephew.  From arriving to leaving, we had a fantastic time. The staff were welcoming, professional, helpful and always on hand. The hotel itself was beautiful with lots of amenities.  Our family suite was comfortable, very clean and spacious with sanitiser and hand wipes. My Nephew loved the TV in the bathroom mirror lol!  My Mum was a little nervous with Covid but was quickly put at ease when she saw the measure and safety regulations the Hotel had put in place.  There was lots of sanitisers, 2m distances obeyed with areas marked off, swimming pool number limits obeyed. Breakfast had bottled juices, bottled waters and pastries and fruits wrapped individually. Dinner was nice and the breakfast had plenty of variety with good quality produce. Lovely grounds and walks. Bikes are available and a great fun way to see the grounds.  Great place overall for Kids and Adults. Will be back soon.",5,2020,09,11
217,Wow. ,What a fantastic hotel. Couldn't fault it in any way. Originally due to stay 3 nights we added on a fourth because we hated leaving. The grounds are fabulous. River walk is so relaxing and beautiful. Our suite was lovely. Bed was so comfortable. Temperature easily adjusted using electronic pad. Bathrooms fab with a small tv. Food both breakfast and dinner was really lovely. Sugar loaf lounge fabulous to sit and have food and a drink. The staff are so friendly and really couldn't do enough for us. Spa and pool are lovely. Handgel and sanitiser throughout the hotel. The only negative is having to leave. ,5,2020,09,10
217,Beyond Expectations!!,"Powerscourt hotel went above and beyond the call of duty for our most recent stay. I could not recommend the hotel and the staff more for the professional, clean and Friendly environment that we were welcomed into. 

The high standards in these uncertain times ensure any concerns we had were put at ease throughout our stay and the staff were more than accommodating for all of our needs! 

The Sika restaurant ensured social distancing was in place and the staff went above and beyond their call of duty for the residents who were dining with them. Myself and my partner will most certainly be returning and would highly recommend to families and couples!",5,2020,09,08
217,Lovely hotel but really misses the mark,"We stayed at the hotel for the August bank holiday weekend and on first impressions the hotel was very impressive. The foyer is breath taking, as are the views. The staff at check in were lovely and very efficient. 

Our room was wonderful, spotless and spacious! You could tell no expense had been spared with the qualitfy of the bed and the fixtures and fittings. You could tell the hotel was being very cautious of COVID measures with the QR code for menus and hotel guides under the glass on the dressing table. 

We had booked in to the pool that evening due to limitations on those that could use it. The guidelines said to use our bathrobes, which we had no problem doing but we had to call reception to get replacement ones as ours were threadbare and had broken ties so they couldn't be closed with the ties. This is when the hotel began missing the mark. The candeliers in the lift were broken with strings of glass beading falling down and when we got to the pool, it was packed! The pool itself was very heavily chlorinated which irritated our skin badly, and the overall pool area was in need of some work. The paint was flaking off the walls and ceiling with a few lights in the ceiling gone out. Afterwards, the replacement robes we ordered that evening in advance of the swim the next day took over an hour to arrive and weren't much better but the ties could stay up and clossed so a positive! 

That evening we had dinner in Sika restaurant and it was absolutely sensational! Service was wonderful and the food delicious - so much so we booked in again the next evening. 

We were very much looking forward to breakfast in Sika in the morning after such a lovely meal but the experience can only be called a disaster. It was very like Fawlty Towers - a comment both we and the table opposite jokingly made. The selection was very limited and of very poor quality. You were waiting so long though you couldn't risk sending it back. The ""toast"" (which arrived after we had finished eating our hot breakfast), was stone cold bread that maybe saw a toaster for 2 seconds and the full irish was barely cooked with the scrambled eggs resembling a soup of butter. The one redeeming item we ate was the fruit parfait with granola - if it wasn't for that, I would have left breakfast hungier than we arrived. The second morning was even worse - over the course of the meal we heard every single table around us either complain about something, having to chase their order, or something arrived that wasn't what they had ordered.

That afternoon we went on the river walk which was absolutely sensational! A wonderful walk which with all of the of routes, can go on for hours. As access is limited to guests and Powerscourt members, it was very quiet and the forest and river felt like something from Narnia or Lord of the Rings. When we got back to the hotel, our room had been cleaned but we noticed the toilettries hadn't been replaced. We called room service and got some no problem but it was a bit of an inconvenience.  

Unfortunately, the second evening at Sika was chalk and cheese compared to the first night and followed the fawlty towers expereince of breakfast. The service on the Sunday evening was extremely slow, the food bland and nothing compared to the night before (we even ordered some of the same dishes and the difference was subpar versus sensational the first night). Something we still laugh about is how the server tossed the cutelry on the table and we had to reorder every single drinks order three times from arrival to leaving. 

Overall the hotel was nice, you could tell alot of money has gone into it but it is as if it hasn't been maintained and standards have really slipped. For example, whilst they had lovely hand sanitizer bottles and stations throughout - the actual dispensers were empty. 

We were so looking forward to the luxurious experience of Powerscourt, like I have heard many friends and family have had, but sadly that wasn't really what we got at all... Management needs to look at more staff training, and attention to detail is needed in terms of decor, covid-era measures and guest experience. The little things count, and unfortunately the hotel missed the mark.",2,2020,09,06
217,Disappointment ,"I regret spending 8 nights in this hotel. When arriving in the room we were waiting 4 hours to get a bottle of champagne delivered and also being completely ignored at breakfast and dinner. The grounds are beautiful however, I don’t recommend this place and I understand we are facing unprecedented times but their service are appealing , not worth the price they ask. ",1,2020,09,05
217,Disappointing Stay....Faulty Towers at best,"After Planning our stay for two nights to be woken up after 12 midnight by a night manager because he had dialled the wrong room, to not being able to find our booking at the pool and the restaurant....What more can i say....Faulty Towers at best is how a lady at breakfast described her experience...",2,2020,09,05
217,Absolute heaven,What a fabulous hotel from the minute we arrive there was such a welcoming and fabulous atmosphere. Keith in McGills was fantastic and so welcoming each night. In the ESPA we were greeted with a very warm welcome from Lauren and Dan provided my treatments and he was to say the least absolutely brilliant! Every bit of our experience in powerscourt was just great. And in the times of Covid I felt the staff were very caution and safe. Thank you for a great trip xx,5,2020,09,04

217,Lovely hotel but the service could have been a lot better!,"We stayed here for a 2 night stay and changed a reservation from later in the year to come visit last week. Having changed this over the phone when we arrived there was no record of our booking/ dinner or pool reservations we had made for that day so eventually the receptionist booked us into a room which was lovely, but didnt have any windows that opened (the room was temperature controlled) so we requested to move to a similar room or pay for an upgrade if available. After waiting quite some time for the concierge to come back to us, which she didnt even after ringing again, my husband visited the front desk and we got moved the next day thankfully. We went to the Sika restaurant on the night we arrived for dinner and recieved an okay meal,the starters were average and I had to return my steak as it was over-done and I did receive a replacement steak which was lovely, but overall the meal was average at best. Other little things like housekeeping knocking on the door before 9am, when it was stated on check in to be after 11am shows a lack of communication between reception and housekeeping and lacking in attention to detail which you would expect in an establishment like Powerscourt. The Sugarloaf Lounge was lovely and the pool and facilities like the sauna and steam room were lovely and I would highly recommend a visit.",3,2020,08,30
217,Relaxing Staycation,"Just enjoyed a very relaxing stay in Powerscourt Hotel with my sisters. The staff could not have been more friendly and efficient. We were greeted on arrival with a glass of bubbles compliments of the reception team. This really set the tone for the stay.
The rooms were amazing and the pool was very clean and we enjoyed a relaxing hour there. the restaurant and lobby staff were friendly and welcoming. We felt very safe in this environment with all necessary Covid precautions in place. The hotel was very busy which itself speaks highly of the service and staff. Lovely surrounding area. Will be back before Christmas!!",5,2020,08,28
217,Beautiful lunch in the sun 😎,"Visited Powerscourt hotel for lunch having gone to the waterfall beforehand. The service was second to none, we were looked after by Filip. 
We sat outside which was really enjoyable being able to look out over the gardens and the Sugar Loaf. 
The food and virgin cocktail were delightful 😋 
There are a lot of wasps around given the time of year which a few citronella candles would probably sort. The the staff had a job on their hands as it got busy the outdoor diners were all seeking to move inside. 
The staff handled it really well though. ",5,2020,08,27
217,Afternoon Tea,Such a fabulous location for afternoon tea.  It was a lovely sunny day and we had booked a table beside the window so we were looking out on the gardens.  Gorgeous food and friendly staff. I would highly recommend it. ,5,2020,08,27
217,End of summer getaway,"Disappointed with the food we got for dinner on both evenings in the restaurant. Breakfast service was poor, we had to ask multiple times to get tea/coffee and to order hot food from the menu. In saying that the hotel itself is amazing and the grounds are beautiful along with the pool etc. The staff were very nice to deal with. The service/food was not 5 star standard.",3,2020,08,25
217,Fantastic Summer Break at Powerscourt,"I spent a few days at the Powerscourt Hotel with my two teenage boys mid-Aug and it was a fantastic experience. From the moment we arrived, everything was exceptionally organised for safety which immediately addressed any anxieties around holidaying in the current client. That meant we were able to thoroughly enjoy the stay including the gardens, use of the bicycles, pools with safety and comfort at the forefront always. I would absolutely recommend holidaying here and will definitely make a return visit. I've been here pre-Covid and he level of service and attention to detail in the current climate has only excelled to meet the difficult climate we were in. An excellent hotel. Niamh from Dublin",5,2020,08,25
217,had its day!!,"What a disappointment for our family - we booked for 2 nights and stayed one - the dinner was poor and the service was lacking in every way.  Covid is creating problems for everyone in business - but we had just come from the Marker Hotel in Dublin - and noticed a huge difference in friendliness and attention to guests.  The Marker was great and this Autograph standard was far off the mark.   The check in was a disaster - the wait time was too long - not enough staff to expedite matters and when we did get checked in we had to wait another 40mins for our keys - which only came to us because we went back up and asked.  If we had not of asked, we could still be waiting.  Room was big - but the decor was tired and not everything worked - the TV in the bathroom for example - good thing the view can't be broken!",2,2020,08,24
217,Problem with our room,"The hotel is beautiful and the setting is gorgeous. Our room was lovely but we could not control the lights or the fan on the first night. At first we just thought the touch screens were just slow, we rang reception and staff were nice and asked if we were operating them properly which we were. We were tired and just wanted to sleep so we said if there was still a problem in the morning we'd call and we turned everything off to go to sleep. The lights were coming on and off for the night and cold air con was blowing non-stop. We didn't really sleep at all which isn't really good enough given the price of staying here. It was fixed within an hour in the morning after the engineer started work at 9 am. According to staff they were newly installed touch screens in the rooms and to be honest they should be checked before allowing guests to check in as the first night was a nightmare. Other than that we found the staff very nice and the facilities great.",3,2020,08,24
217,An oasis of calm,"In theses turbulent times I was reluctant to take a break but was persuaded to spend four nights in Powerscourt. The rooms were spacious with magnificent views. Food was delicious and the spa was pure heaven. The staff must be commended for the way in which they have adapted to the new normal and Covid measures. At all times I felt in safe hands and I listened to the spa staff reassure guests of their sanitising measures which I noticed they acted upon impeccable. There is no doubt, guest safety is a priority...five stars all the way.",5,2020,08,24
217,Service abysmal - not 5 star standard,"Powerscourt is nicely situated, the rooms are sparkling clean (there is an excellent housekeeping service) generously proportioned and the setting is very special. However, the service is far below the level you would expect in even a three star hotel. The breakfast buffet was the worst we have ever experienced at a four or five star hotel. Longlife pastries in plastic, some melon and yoghurt. Nothing baked in-house. The cooked breakfasts were inedible. The service was slow and forgetful for every meal. It seemed like there were very few managers operating in the Sika restaurant at breakfast and dinner, and that the staff were very young, untrained, casual workers for whom every order went in one ear and out the other. Tables were left uncleared. Every order had to be followed up with repeated requests. Service was better on one evening when we dined in the sugarloaf lounge, but the following day we returned and were seated at a dirty table and had to ask repeatedly for it to be cleaned. All in all a very disappointing and expensive experience. Not in the same league as top class Irish hotels such as the Merrion in Dublin or the Park Hotel in Kenmare. Book somewhere else!",2,2020,08,23
217,Very disappointing and not worthy of a 5-star rating,"My husband and I waited a long time to stay at Powerscourt Hotel but chose it for the venue in which to celebrate our wedding anniversary last month.  Even though check in was 4pm, our room was not ready until 4:50pm.  Service at the Sika Restaurant was very slow and we were offered the same brief menu, two nights in the row.  At check in, a copy of my credit card was not put on the booking (their mistake) and so we were hounded by the spa, restaurant and bar to pay our bills on the spot.  At check out, we asked to speak to the manager and was made wait 50 minutes until he came over to us.  We expressed our disappointment at what we hoped would be a much anticipated 5-star experience.  We were promised a response by email, which we never received.  We will not be returning to Powerscourt Hotel and remain annoyed that the money we spent on our two nights here did not reflect the service and experience we received.",2,2020,08,23
217,Restaurant service is very far rom 5 star,"We previously stayed here in May 2018 and I reviewed our stay then, saying that nobody seemed to be overseeing/coordinating food and beverage service. Two years later, and the story was the same! The hotel has lots going for it - gorgeous setting, very high housekeeping standards, comfortable surroundings, great leisure facilities. Unfortunately the missing 5 star component is restaurant service that you would complain about in a basic hotel in any Irish town.

We had to ask for tea and coffee four times one morning at breakfast. It came on the fourth time of asking when we adopted the strategy of pretending we were ordering for the first time rather than enquiring about an order that had already been made. At dinner, the table beside us had been occupied by a family with a child who had smeared chocolate ice cream all over the tablecloth. These things happen but it was left uncleared for 90 minutes while we had dinner looking at it! A manager should be all over that type of situation in 5 minutes flat, clearing the table themselves if necessary. There is a huge need for staff mentoring, training and a manager constantly circulating in the diningroom to oversee service. We didn't feel one member of staff was responsible for our table at either breakfast or dinner on our two night stay - a simple fix that would have ironed out lots of issues if combined with a manager constantly doing the rounds.

Breakfast was poor. I realise that the usual buffet isn't possible in a time of Covid but maybe a 5 star hotel could do something inventive like have trolley service of pastries, fruits etc or place a basket of homemade breads on each table as a starting point?

There is a real failure of management to make this hotel fully 5 star by having a dining experience of the requisite standard.",3,2020,08,23
217,Disappointing level of service on honeymoon,"We booked a 1 night stay last minute. Due to covid we had had to spend a week apart right after our wedding - hell. So this was effectively the start of our honeymoon - which we'd had to cancel. I explained all this to a woman on the phone, who said ""I'll leave something in your room"". On arrival: no mention of honeymoon, nothing in our room. Randomly, other people in the queue for check in were handed bubbles, but not us - bit odd. Had to ask about the 'something in the room', which was embarrassing. Four macaroons arrived a couple of hours later. Ok fine. However the next day I find out that my sister had ordered and paid for bubbles and chocolate-dipped strawberries for our room - never arrived. So disappointing. That would have given us the bit of extra treatment we'd like for a honeymoon, and they didn't even deliver that.

Had hoped by raising the issues with management we wouldn't have to leave this review, but when I raised it the next morning, had an apologetic call and they said they were ""investigating"" and that further info would be available hopefully for when we checked out. I had emailed them making them aware of the issue, and asking could we have a later check out (they gave us an hour).  On check out we were asked ""how was your stay"" - no awareness of the issues. We were simply asked to pay a 40 euro lunch bill (could have been waived - nope). 

24 hours have now gone by and no further email from the hotel, no promised explanation of what happened. On the phone the woman had said ""unfortunately we can't extend your stay as we are fully booked tonight"" - that was confusing - we hadn't asked for that but, sure, if you think that's something you'd like to offer us, then do so (a voucher would do), otherwise don't say it as a lame aside like that... 

This is literally a once in a lifetime event we've chosen to spend at your hotel, surely you could do better...?  

Staff otherwise v. pleasant. It was nice that sauna and steam room were open and no issues getting access to pool. Good level of hand sanitiser stations around the place. Nice piano music in lounge. 

Other small issues. A table of 10 people were dining at Sika restaurant c. 4pm, in breach of govt guidelines that it's 6 to a table max. My sister told me to look forward to an amazing breakfast. Unfortunately it was underwhelming in the extreme. The cereal choice was Kellogs multi-variety packs. The pastries were not freshly made (packaging said made in France) and were akin to airplane food. The veggie sausages were literally inedible (husband also couldn't stomach them), leaving me hungry after the ""full"" veggie breakfast (1 egg, half a tomato, half a small mushroom and some heinz beans). With no buffet, you can't top up hot food, and I didn't fancy the soggy croissants. Surely just have a staff member with a tongs handing out fresh ones?? 

All in all, didn't feel like a 5 star experience.",2,2020,08,23
217,The Best,"Staycation in Ireland - Stayed 4 nights with family, this a gem of a hotel, just outside Dublin, staff were amazing, service brilliant, food amazing, biggest rooms and so comfortable, will defiently return, beautiful river walks.",5,2020,08,23
217,Wonderful stay!,"My boyfriend and I stayed for 1night. Overall we were very happy with our stay . 
-We arrived early for check in . We knew it wasn’t until 4pm but we were hoping to go for a walk around the gardens before checking in . It was pouring rain so we had drinks in the lounge while we were waiting . Reception rang us when the room was ready 
-Rooms are fabulous ! Bathroom is so nice with the tv too. Very spacious rooms 
-All staff wearing masks and sanitizing dispensers throughout the hotel 
- Staff are exceptional and go out of their way for you . They are what makes this hotel a 5 star hotel 
-We ate in the bar and staff were so friendly here .
-We had to wait for a table and the barman gave us a round on the house which I thought was a nice gesture for the wait and to acknowledge it . 
-Have to personally mention Daniel in the sugar loaf lounge . We booked afternoon tea for the next day . We wanted to share one as I’m
a diabetic and wouldn’t be able to eat a full one myself with all the sugar . (Was initially told by email that we would have to get one each so I rang the hotel and explained and the girl was so accommodating. Sorry I didn’t get her name ) 
-  Daniel was so accommodating and also informed me that the chef asked if I wanted to substitute any of the deserts for less sugar ones . 

Thank you for a great stay .",5,2020,08,22
217,My happy place,"Felt very safe during Covid. All staff wearing masks and copious amounts of hand sanitizer at the appropriate touch points.  Dining sitting was appropriately spaced apart and outdoors, where possible.  Swimming pool was by 45 minute timed slots and never felt crowded or too busy. 

Luxury in a nutshell. Beautiful spacious rooms, immaculate public areas, and well designed grounds. Small, but sufficient, playground for the small children. 

We had a rollaway for our 7 year old, and he enjoyed having his “own room” as we put it in the closet / dressing room. 

Avoca and world famous Powerscourt Gardens on the grounds of the estate. What more could you ask for?

We spent 5 nights and loved every second. Could’ve stayed longer! ",5,2020,08,22
217,Proposal,"I want to personally thank each and every member of staff at the Powerscourt hotel who made me and my now fiancé’s stay absolutely perfect. From start to finish you made us feel so welcome and we felt really taken care of. Also a very special thanks to Liam at reception for upgrading us on arrival to a mountain view suite. He was extremely efficient and friendly. I look forward to booking a stay with you again.

Many thanks 

David Healy",5,2020,08,21
217,Covid safety,"Hotel accommodation excellent. Very helpful staff. The hotel hasn’t got it quite right with the booking of restaurants and the queueing.  Guests were not encouraged to wear facemasks and social distancing was very poor. The vast majority of guests paid little or no attention to Covid safety advice.  The staff did not enforce the procedures.  Whilst we have enjoyed our stay we did not feel very safe.  Overall a very pleasant stay but we will not be rushing back until Covid procedures are more rigidly enforced.  There was no evidence of the room having been deep cleaned with dust apparent in some parts of the room.  Small points, but in the current situation these issues need to be taken seriously for the safety of everyone. ",4,2020,08,21
217,Service let this place down ,"The hotel itself is stunning and has the most fantastic views over the sugarloaf mountains. 
I really felt the service wasn’t up to 5 stars. On check in we asked about lunch. The receptionist said we could have lunch in the bar there, then he said it’s not open till 5.30! It was 3pm so that was no good! We asked what about the sugarloaf lounge, he said that was fine but they were only serving sandwiches- perfect we thought. Over we went to the sugarloaf where they rudely and dismissively informed us it’s only afternoon tea. Although sandwiches forms a part of this they wouldn’t serve just sandwiches. It was their extremely rude manner that was most disappointing. Eventually we went to the restaurant area. Menu was limited and service mediocre. 
The room was beautiful with a great bathroom and great views. 
Dinner was good, polite waitress but I felt she hadn’t been fully trained to deliver a five star experience. Food was tasty. 
Breakfast was another area where service was lacking and disappointing experience.
The pool was nice and lovely lady in reception there discussed the skincare products they sell there. 
Overall I really was disappointed with the service, it impacted on our overall enjoyment. ",3,2020,08,20
217,Everything was perfect!,"My boyfriend & I stayed here last week and everything was perfect! From the service, to the food & our bedroom was out of this world. Liam on reception was so attentive and nothing was too much to ask, along with everyone else we met! My boyfriend and I both work in hotels and we were so impressed with everything this hotel has to offer. The rental bikes made travelling around so fun and easy, it is such a brilliant idea. From the food in the sika restuarant, to the breakfast & our room service meals everything was 10/10. We will definately be back!! ",5,2020,08,19
217,Just gorgeous!,"Stayed here the 18th of August 2020 as my boyfriend and I decided on a much needed break away- I can only say that everything was fantastic from start to finish- we arrived slightly before usual check-in however our room was ready early and our bags were delivered up for us- such a nice gesture! The room itself was gorgeous, and the bed was HUGE, the pillows were honestly like clouds- we had a view of the fountain out back of the hotel which was also quite special in the evening. 
Our stay included dinner in the Sika restaurant which was genuinely something else- the food was to die for, and all of our servers and the hostess on the door were so kind and real craftspeople at their work (I’ve worked in the hotel industry for years so I know great service when I see it)- special mention to Cliona our waitress who was just fab! 
We followed dinner with cocktails in the lobby area where they had a live pianist playing music, the atmosphere was so relaxing!
Breakfast the next morning was a real treat also, the continental buffet was really well stocked and the hot breakfast from the kitchen was wonderful too- the chefs here know what they’re at, that’s for sure.
Thanks to all the staff who made our stay so wonderful! Hope to come back again soon!",5,2020,08,19
217,Midweek trip,"Upon arriving at Powerscourt hotel, we were greeted by the most friendly and inviting staff and gorgeous view of the sugar loaf from the lobby. We stayed in a stunning suite with an idyllic view of the pristine grounds and surrounding mountains. The pool and spa are just a dream for anyone who loves to relax!

Sika restaurant had a fantastic midweek offer of 3 course meal for €50pp and the food was delicious! When dining, you have the option to sit out on the balcony overlooking the fountain and gardens, which we took with open arms. 

We also took the bikes out and explored the exceptional estate, which was such a great activity to have available to adults and children! 

You’d be MAD not to stay here!",5,2020,08,13
217,Amazing hotel ,"Celebrated our 25th wedding anniversary last week in this hotel.Upgraded to a suite overlooking beautiful gardens and water fountain which was fabulous. Rooms were spacious and beautifully decorated. Food was lovely, good choice on all the menus  and reasonably priced for a 5 star hotel.Staff were welcoming and very pleasant and courteous. Lovely walks within the estate, recommend the river walk but be prepared for a long uphill on the way back. Everywhere was spot leaned plenty of handheld wherever they are needed. ",5,2020,08,10
217,Average at best,"Stopped off here for lunch with family members. Being a 5 star establishment, I really expected better. The decor was very pleasing indeed and the view of the Sugarloaf was breathtaking. However, the food was very much average. The biggest letdown was the service. Some of the staff were pleasant but the majority appeared inexperienced and unwilling to provide the 5 star service expected. One simple request was met with a response which later turned out to be a downright lie. 5 stars?? Treating their customers like fools.
I won't be back.",2,2020,08,08
217,Trip of a lifetime ,We stayed in Powerscourt last week from the moment we arrived the staff were so helpful. The afternoon tea and dinner were just amazing. The attention to detail was just outstanding we had just got engaged and the staff really made it so special for us. Thanks to all the team at Powerscourt we cant wait to return. ,5,2020,08,08
217,Wonderful experience,"We stayed in this hotel many times and i can honestly say that this was our best stay yet.
We were worried about the safety of the hotel in the context of covid.
We felt totally safe.
The suite on the third floor was amazing.
From check in to check out all of the staff could not have done more for us.
The staff at breakfast were totally amazing each and everyone of them.
The quality of the food was also excellent. 
We had an amazing 4 days here and cant wait to return. 
Thank you to all.",5,2020,08,07
217,Mother/daughter weekend,"From start to finish our experience at powerscourt was above and beyond what we expected. The staff at reception were so friendly and inviting, the room was amazing, gorgeous views over the gardens, we had dinner in the irish pub, which was very good. Also importantly everything was spotless and social distancing and sanitising was very well managed, we felt at ease and relaxed the entire time and are already looking at returning very soon.",5,2020,08,07
217,Great few days away,Stayed here for 2 nights during the august bank holiday and the hotel is amazing. The rooms are very spacious and the bed is so comfy. We had food in the sugar loaf lounge and it was super tasty and not too pricy. Our server Daniel was brilliant and made us feel like VIP’s. Daniel deserves a raise 😄. Thank you to all the staff who were very helpful and nothing was too much for them to help us with. We will definitely be back. Thank you so much for everything.,5,2020,08,05
217,Relaxing weekend ,"This hotel is absolutely fantastic for a relaxing family weekend. Our suite was spacious and spotless, the pool was great for our daughter, so was the playground outside. The breakfast, McGills dinner and room service food was fantastic, served by attentive staff. ",5,2020,08,04
217,Fabulous,"Fabulous four night stay in Powerscourt Hotel which allowed us to relax and enjoy a much needed break after Covid lockdown. The staff were amazing and nothing was too much trouble. The pool was fantastic, but please be aware that due to ongoing social distancing requirements you need to book your swim in advance. I recommend booking swim times before you arrive to avoid disappointment. The spa treatment was fabulous and the grounds are gorgeous. We were given a room with an amazing view out over the fountain towards the mountain, who could ask for more?  The hotel is in a great location beside Powerscourt gardens, river walks and you can even visit a whiskey distillery which we found interesting. I see other reviewers have commented on the breakfast. This is cooked to order and may not have the selection that would have usually been available, however the hotel is providing a good selection despite the covid restrictions. It would however be nice to see a refresh of the Sika dinner menu/Lounge menu with some additional choices for those staying an extra few days. We will definitely return to this amazing hotel!",5,2020,08,03
217,Average at best,"Pros
- Lovely grounds, we did the bike ride by the River Walk which was the highlight of the trip.
- McGills bar is lovely, staff here were very welcoming - especially the Bar Manager Keith. 
- Decor is nice.

Cons
- Check in; we arrived at the hotel at 3.50pm, after being guaranteed a room by 4pm in an email post-arrival. We were waiting 55 minutes until we got a key (4.55pm), and subsequently missed our pool reservation (which needed to be booked in advance). When we enquired with the pool receptionist if we could push our pool reservation back, she noted that they were completely booked up.
- Staff; we encountered one too many rude, unfriendly or condescending staff. Both mornings we had a really uncomfortable encounter with the restaurant manager who was unwelcoming and dismissive. On arrival to the hotel, we heard the reception manager noting the amount of complaints they were getting to a colleague. However it must be said that most of the wait/restaurant staff we met were lovely. 
- Instructions; a lot has changed in the hotel, as we presumed with Covid. We received very little instruction on arrival to the hotel. Luckily we had organised our meal times and pool times in advance. My advise here would be to call the hotel well in advance of arrival and book everything. 
- Food; very disappointed in breakfast both mornings. On the first morning we I got a waffle and my partner got the Irish breakfast. They were 50 minutes arriving to our table and cold once they arrived. The second morning we had a similar experience with cold food, but this time without delay. 
- Room lighting; we were on the second floor and there was no natural light in our room. The lights in the room are motion censored, making the room very dark. Definitely worth requesting a room in the 3 - 5 floor. 

Advice to guests:
- Book everything in advance to avoid disappointment. The hotel does not hold extra slots for the pool or restaurant for last minute bookings. 
- We were made to believe that the restaurant was the only place we could eat in the hotel at the time of our stay. This is not the case, check out the menus for McGills bar and the Sugar Loaf Lounge which were pretty impressive for food with casual surroundings.
- Spa; much of the spa is closed at the moment. For a better spa experience, perhaps shop around. 
- Queues; as expected with the current climate, we encountered queues multiple times of the day (breakfast, pool, lunch, dinner etc.) I'd recommend arriving early to your allotted time. 

Overall, a pretty average experience and definitely not a 5 star experience.",3,2020,08,03
217,Wow,"Hi all,

Just a quick email to show our thanks .

Myself and my wife Shona are just back from a 1 night stay at your wonderful hotel. Well, all I can say is WOW!!!

From the minute we arrived we were warmly welcomed by all the staff at the hotel. A special thanks to Mossy who took our bags to the room. Our anniversary stay was made even more memorable by getting an upgrade to a suite with a spectacular view. 

After a lovely swim and a treatment we were ready to explore. Maike was a fountain of knowledge and humour when we got our old fashioned bikes and headed for the River Walk. All great fun going down hill but she never mentioned that we had to come back the same way.

We know it's difficult to operate in these new circumstances we are living in but you nailed it from start to finish. 

Thanks again for an amazing stay and a special thank you to Pete.

Stay safe 

Rob & Shona

217,Great Hotel,"Last weekend I had the pleasure of spending 2 days in Powerscourt  hotel and was delighted. It is only a short drive from Dublin so very convenient. The staff were young and so helpful    And my bedroom was amazing. I used the facility of the pool and also took a bike trip around the estate   
The two dinners we had were delicious and I particularly loved the green salad starter and prawn dish in the sugar loaf restaurant   I was surprised that our breakfast in our rooms was so good and very punctual.",5,2020,08,02
217,Fantastic view ,"Spent the weekend with family. We had a wonderful time. Excellent service, fabulous food and wow those views. Even with the current restrictions they handled it very well. Highly recommend, will return again. ",5,2020,08,02
217,Christmas Short Break,"Another very good stay at Powerscourt over Christmas. Facilities - the pool, spa, gym, river walk - are excellent. Lovely festive feel - hotel is beautifully decorated. Restaurants are good too, casual option has improved over the years. So close to Dublin but yet a complete escape. Recommend.",5,2020,08,02
217,Anniversary Stay,"Excellent 2 night stay. Staff could not be more helpful. Food was fab and we ate in all outlets. Setting is beautiful helped by good weather. Fantastic room.  Only gripe is not having a window that you can open.Covid measures very good.  Only grievance was 2 women in the bar on Thursday night and their language was disgusting, they abused floor staff, wanted all present to hear they were drinking the most expensive wine, name dropping big shot names, their kids in the bar at 11pm in PJs, 1 of these women is from a recognised Irish band where the band name carries the family surname.  She needed to be removed IMO, disgusting behaviour, management needed to eject her as other people didn't pay to hear that kind of language.  
Will be back again. Loved our stay.",5,2020,08,02
217,Splendid,5 siblings and partners had a wonderful 2 night stay in the Powerscourt Hotel. We were so well looked after and the food was amazing in both the Sika restaurant and the Sugar loaf lounge. Everyone was so happy we’ve committed to making it an annual event.,5,2020,08,01
217,An Excellent Break! ,"I have just returned from a stay in Powerscourt on Thursday, 30 July. My mom and I had such a brilliant stay! The hotel itself is stunning and they have put a lot of work into making people feel safe  with Covid protocols. Hand sanitiser throughout, social distancing and supplies in the room. When we got there we were able to check in early which was a great way to spend as much time in the hotel as we could. We were also upgraded to a mountain view room which was such a lovely thing to do for us! We were so appreciative of it as the view was fabulous and the room was huge and stunning. Everything from the cocktails in the lounge, to the pool, was fantastic! For dinner we were able to order off the bar menu in the lounge. I would say though the menu is quite limited and it would be nice to see more choices, but the food was nice.  I wanted to post this as all the staff were so friendly and they really went above and beyond to make sure our stay was amazing. They are a real credit to the hotel. Cannot recommend Powerscourt enough! ",5,2020,07,31
217,One word... 'WOW' ,What an unreal experience... From the moment I pulled into car park until the moment I drove out... Got upgrade to a suite for my GF bday which I thought was so nice of the staff. They even called to the room door with chocolates and then to top it of at dinner they came out with a wee plate saying happy birthday. Place is so unreal. You wouldn't see a better setting for an hotel anywhere in Europe 😍😍😍,5,2020,07,31
217,Lovely rooms and food but service lets it down,"Similar to other reviews, our room wasn’t ready despite booking to check in at 4pm. Biggest gripe was however not being able to have a pre dinner g&t despite being booked in for €100 meal. No coordination between bar lounge and formal dining room which seem to operate as separate entities. Staff did eventually facilitate an aperitif  but was left feeling like a diva, which shouldn’t have been the case at these prices. Food was excellent though.",3,2020,07,23
217,Disappointing ,"After a long time of been “on my list” we decided to spend sometime there this year on staycation as a family this year(2adults & 1 baby). An absolutely stunning hotel with incredible grounds and  scenery. The hotel is gorgeous and so luxurious, extremely generous rooms and the most comfortable bed, the big let down for us was dining! On arrival while waiting for our room we decided to have some lunch. We were quickly shown to our table outside as requested and soon after that forgotten about. I had to ask for a baby chair, was never offered( out of dining in the hotel 5 times, 4 of these times I had to request the baby chair). We were waiting at least 20mins when I decided to ask could we order, someone came to table said no problem I will get an iPad and never arrived back. Another 15 mins or so passed and I asked another waiter and our ordered was taken. While waiting for our food and still not even a glass of water delivered to the table at this stage we were asked were we finished?!?!
Chicken wings were nice, I ordered chips with Cajun seasoning, I just got chips. 
My husband ordered the fish and chips was to come with garlic mayo(no garlic mayo). Not once did someone come to our table to see if everything was okay. Put a little dampener  to  the start of our stay here but i put it to the back of my mind and put it down to luck. 
Breakfast was good, food was okay, restrictions due to Covid but staff for breakfast were fantastic. 
We went to Mc gills for dinner on first night(arrived early) so got seated just in time before got busy. There are some of the same food on the lunch as the dinner menu. Staff were friendly and efficient and we were served swiftly and as expected. Then comes dinner in Silka Resturant on our 2nd night, it was a 7.15pm dining time(all that was available) and I was mindful of this with our little one. Yet again no chair offered had to ask even thou when I booked I stayed there was baby. 
We were shown to the table by the manager(I think) and asked if we would like to have still or sparkling water to start, I said yes please still would be lovely. We waited yet another good while before I asked could we order, I got the mozzarella started and my husband chicken terrine, these were delivered to table and we still hadn’t received our water. For mains we both got the rib eye which was delicious by far the nicest food we had here in the few days. We were finished up and must of having our empty plates sitting in front of us for 30mins before I got the attention to ask someone could we order dessert, orders when in and over 20mins later still waiting while people around us were getting there even thou after ordering after us. It was 9.15pm at this stage with a really tired baby and I had enough. The service ruined an absolutely beautiful meal. I asked for the bill that we had to go. To be fair they offered to send them to room and did discount the overall meal price. For me this was the icing on the cake. Definitely not the 5star experience you would imagine. 
Gorgeous hotel but need to up there dining staff training because frankly this service is unacceptable for 5star hotel and will lose out on guest returning ",3,2020,07,23
217,bad start with check in,"ive stayed here a fair few times and always loved it, so didn't really want to write a bad review but i just thought it needed to be shared due to the price we paid, and this time i was very disappointed,

first we went to check in and 4 o clock check in is late as it is due to the price but we had a swim booked at 4 and 4 had been and gone and we still hadnt been checked in, we had to get the luggage taken to the pool and get changed down there even tho the changing rooms where closed off due to covid, so with 3 young kids and trying to shower them off after the pool was a nightmare as the water was freezing,

then we got to the room and the AC wouldn't turn off it was like a sauna in the room, we finally got it switched off only for it to come on full blast at 7am waking my baby which in turn woke everyone in the room, 7am isnt really to early apart from the spot lights right under the window which didn't switch off till 12am, then it seemed the electrics in the bathroom where dodgy as the lights flickered and the tele came on by itself at 1 am waking myself up after i had just fell asleep,

then the next morning i had a bath and the handle came off the door which locked me in the bathroom until my partner let me out,

there was a broken table which nearly cut the hand off the baby when she went to pick up her soother she dropped,

then whatever was in the bed ate my partner alive,

the hotel itself is still beautiful and spotless and the food was gorgeous, just a really bad stay all in all",3,2020,07,23
217,Overnight stay,"This hotel is now my favourite.  We had a fabulous 24 hour stay here.  From the moment we entered and checked in to the moment we left was fantastic.  All the staff were excellent and very professional.   The manager  went out of his way to attend to guests

The hotel is spotless and we even got a free upgrade which was appreciated .   Our room was amazing .  We had afternoon tea in the sugarloaf Lounge and then at night had a lovely meal there too.   Can’t thank the staff enough for their care and we’ll be back .",5,2020,07,22
217,"Good Service, Pre-made food","Visiting Powerscourt garden we stopped in a Powercourt Hotel to have some nibble with a drinks. Waiter recommended  cheese and meat platter which was very disappointing, it was so obvious that  salami and cheese was pre-sliced way before was served on the table(also we got the food before drinks!!) In fairness we ate most of the platter. But serving dry parts of cheese and salami  its truly disappointing and unacceptable for a  5 star hotel &resort .. As we were walk-in nobody took our contact number as far as know its a must these days with Covid-19. When i asked for the bill i mentioned  and showed dry parts of cheese, salami, strawberry to the waiter, he said that he can remove it from the bill,but i said its not needed. ""Offering something extra its a nice gesture"" Before unhappy customers leave,considering that was three tables and around four staff members on the floor",3,2020,07,22
217,Amazing!!,"My husband and I visited for two nights to celebrate our first wedding anniversary. The staff were amazing and upgraded our room to a suite which was a fantastic surprise. Everything was top class, from the staff, to the facilities to the dining. We had all of our meals in the hotel as the food was so good. We are already looking forward to our next trip back. Thank you!",5,2020,07,21
217,Amazing!!!,"Stayed for one night at this wonderful hotel with my girlfriend. A really nice treat after lockdown. The hotel is spotless with lots of social distancing procedures in place. Hand sanitizers placed all round the hotel and plenty of signage. We had the most amazing room and and beautiful few of the garden and mountains from our room, it was just mind blowing, we ate in both the bar and restaurant and the staff and food where amazing top class service and the food was mouthwatering!! We both had full body massage from the excellent therapists the next morning, could not fault anything was so relaxing and just what we needed after lowdown, 1night was not enough would love to stay for week and I will definitely be back again , 10/10 all round best stay I ever had .",5,2020,07,20
217,Disappointing,"I stayed in Powerscourt in August 2019 for my mam's 60th birthday. We were very excited about out stay as Powerscourt as it has such a good reputation. We arrived in the hotel at 3 and we were told that our room wasn't ready as check in wasn't til 4. We said we'd have a drink in the bar and they said they'd ring when our room was ready. At 4.30 we still hadn't received a call so I went back to reception. Our room was not ready. By 5.30 we had still not heard from reception. Yet again I went up and asked if we could check in. We were told it would just be another few minutes. We were finally able to check in around 5.45. We received little or no apology for this extremely late check in. We were not even offered a beverage while we waited. 
When we did finally make it to our room we were extremely impressed. Our room was just stunning! So spacious and luxurious. We were also highly impressed by the pool facilities and our dinner in the restaurant. It was delicious and the service was excellent.  While the food at breakfast the next morning was lovely the service was absolutely shocking. The dining room was extremely understaffed. My mam had asked for her bacon to grilled a little extra and we were waiting for over 30 minutes for it. 

Even though I was slightly let down by the experience I decided to give Powerscourt another go this month. I traveled there last week for one night with friends. Check in was a lot smoother this time and dinner yet again was amazing! Breakfast however was a shambles! We were shown to our table but not given a menu. When I asked for one we were told that there was no menu available that the only breakfast option was a full Irish. We were extremely disappointed by this. The buffet was also very disappointing. No fresh bread or pastries. The toast we were given was mouldy and I had to return it. We waited over 30 minutes for our breakfast before asking the waiter to check our order. All the tables around us were served and it was clear that our order had been forgotten. As before the dining room was understaffed. I don't think this is good enough for a 5 star hotel.",3,2020,07,19
217,Fantastic Experience,"My wife and I stayed in Powerscourt to celebrate our wedding anniversary and we couldn’t have picked a better hotel to do so. Our stay began with a really warm welcome from the concierge and porters as we checked in. The practices in place for sanitising and social distancing were plentiful without being intrusive and made you feel very safe. The room was AMAZING, huge bed and bathroom with a separate sitting room and walk-in closet, pure luxury. 
We ate in the Sika restaurant that night and the food was cooked and presented immaculately. Our server Daniel was one of the friendliest waiters we’ve encountered in years of eating out. He brought us extra desert and champagne for our anniversary and after our meal brought us out to the lobby to take photos for us. 
The next morning the weather was lovely so we had breakfast out on the veranda off the restaurant. The service was really fast and friendly and the food again was lovely. 
All in all the stay was fantastic and all the staff impressed with their willingness to help and ensure we had a great stay. We’ll definitely be returning. Five stars from us!",5,2020,07,19
217,Fantastic Staycation,"Stayed for Four nights at this wonderful hotel.  We were a little nervous of the post lockdown treat but we had no need to be.  The hotel is spotless with lots of social distancing procedures in place.  Hand sanitizers placed all round the hotel and plenty of signage.  We availed of the pool booking, full body massage from the excellent therapists.  We ate in both the bar and the restaurant and both were top class.  Staff more than helpful and apologetic about the restrictions that covid have enforced on them, but all for our safety so happy to comply.  We will definitely be back, can’t believe I haven’t been there before!",5,2020,07,17
217,Mixed visit,"My husband and I have just returned from a 2 night stay. Having stayed before we had high expectations and unfortunately in general we felt slightly let down by our stay. We had stayed at another hotel in Kildare for the 2 nights before this stay which we really enjoyed. It was a 4 star hotel so had hoped we wouldn’t be disappointed by 5 star Powerscourt. 

We were able to check in early at 2.30pm. Our room was 533 and was lovely - the classic rooms are so large compared to other hotels and the bathroom is great. We ate elsewhere on the first night but wanted to sit in the lobby area when we came back but the sugarloaf lounge was closed. There was no atmosphere and it meant after dinner you really just had to go to your room. I understand hotel bars are closed with Covid but I think they could have served tea/coffee etc. We phoned reception to get some decaf teabags sent to the room and it took over 30 mins, and the next night my husband asked for a wine glass to be sent as he had brought a bottle of wine with him(there’s no mini bar in the room and they had removed the glasses too) The glass took an hour to arrive and a second phone call to remind them. They were very apologetic but it’s not really a 5 star service. 

We booked a slot for the pool which worked well as it was very quiet and meant you didn’t need to worry about it being busy. It was very clean and a nice temperature.

We ate in Sika on our second night and we couldn’t fault the food or the service. Our waitress was very friendly and chatty and looked after us well. A couple behind us said their meal was terrible which we were surprised at- we eat out a lot and everything was cooked perfectly. I think she said her steak was fatty but my husbands was perfect. Portion size was good and the ingredients were all top notch.

Our biggest gripe was breakfast. This was memorable on our last visit and this time was extremely disappointing. There was a small buffet section with a selection of small cereal boxes, some berry parfait made up in glasses, some smoked salmon and wheaten bread and individually wrapped croissants/pastries. There were also plastic bottles of Tropicana. This seemed crazy for the standards of the hotel. You could then order either a traditional Irish or veggie breakfast. Our toast was cold both days and service slow. The previous hotel we stayed in offered a plate of pastries when we sat down, served us fresh juice, and there were then extensive continental and hot breakfast options, all of which was served to the table. I don’t understand why they think this current system works but it really cheapens the hotel not to mention the amount of plastic that is being used. 

It was interesting listening to other guests-everyone had the same gripes. Slow service, no little 5 star touches, no spark.

The grounds of the hotel were lovely and all the staff were courteous. It just felt they were running the hotel at full capacity with a skeleton staff - and this does it work in a 5 star hotel. 

We will likely return in non-Covid times but having paid the normal prices for the experience we left feeling a bit hard done by. Even a token 10% off voucher against a future stay would have softened it slightly. We hope they can get back to their usual high standard soon. ",3,2020,07,15
217,Finally a great night away!,"Brought my fiancé to Powerscourt Hotel for the night for her 30th birthday and it was the perfect break away. Our room was facing the water feature in the well manicured garden. Such a relaxing setting. 

Like most, we were nervous about going to a hotel due to COVID19 but we found that the hotel was set up very well to manage the guests in terms of social distancing and general hygiene. 

We had lunch and dinner in Sika restaurant and the food was excellent. My fiancé had a Powerscourt Experience spa treatment which she found very relaxing and no different from a pre-covid19 spa experience. Breakfast the next morning we decided to have in our room and we had a suite with a nice patio area overlooking the garden. It was delivered on time and was warm and well presented. 

Tatu and Yvette (I think), were the standout members of staff who were very courteous and helpful. 

The trip was a very welcome break. The hotel was surprisingly close to Dublin City Centre. We got there in 25 minutes. All in all a great stay and we will definitely be back.",5,2020,07,14
217,Up and down visit,"Myself and my wife arrived for a one night stay. After being told by reservations we might be able to check in early we arrived at 3 o’clock to check in instead of 4. We were told the room would be ready in a few minutes and would get a call but after an hour there was no call so we went back to the desk. It was clear that we had been forgotten about but were eventually given our key and sent off to find our room.
After getting to the room there was no slippers for us to use to go to the pool with. After calling housekeeping and waiting half an hour there was no sign on them so I went back down to the reception desk and eventually we had them sent to our room. Unfortunately we had missed our booking time for the pool. The pool team were able to accommodate us and we got to go for a swim. 
I wanted to get a pint before my dinner so went to the bar to bring a pint back to my room but was told I needed to order food to have a pint. I was told I could order room service for a pint( please explain that to me) but I also had to pay €5 service charge for a pint
The restaurant team were a different class and brought the standards back up to what I would expect of the Powerscourt hotel... the restaurant duty manager deserves a special mention for sending my pregnant wife’s meal up to the room along with our dessert to finish.
After asking the waitress were we allowed to go to the bar to order a drink after our dinner we were told this was allowed. The bar staff again told us this wasn’t possible despite us having eaten dinner in the restaurant...the bar staff eventually would let me have a pint but I feel you really need to organise this better. I understand social distancing is important but what is wrong with ordering a pint and bringing it back to my room? 
The spa staff were amazing. We had lovely massages the next morning.
I understand this is a difficult time but it feels that standards have slipped at a once amazing hotel! ",3,2020,07,12
217,disappointing,"We were expecting a great stay but we felt we were let down!! We arrived at 2.30 to check in but our room wasn't ready which is understandable. Our room wasn't ready until 4.45 which is late enough in my view. We were told we could eat in the main restaurant or the bar. We decided on the bar and arrived to see that it was closed on a Monday. We weren't told that only the pool would be open and not the added extras!!! Very little communication between the reception and hotel staff I feel. We stayed for 2 nights and had to ask reception for a change of towels. Our bins were full they needed emptying and other little things could've been seen to. 
Breakfast was very good and staff were very friendly . I don't think I will be returning any time soon as I didn't get the 5 star feel I was expecting!!",3,2020,07,12
217,Post Covid Teething Issues Perhaps,"We arrived at the hotel just after 3pm after a very wet day in Glendalough. Our room wasn't ready so we sat in the Sugar Loaf Lounge and ordered coffee. We then decided to go downstairs for food as we hadn't heard anything from the reception team. McGills does not open until 5.30pm due to Covid restrictions so we ate in Sika restaurant. It was a lovely experience. Coming towards 5pm I had not received a phone call about our room which I was told I would get. I was anxious about getting into the room as our clothes were wet after Glendalough and we had booked a pool time for 6pm. I went back up to reception to see what was happening and they told me that our room was ready. We were handed our key but there was no sign of mention of the concierge with our bag. We then had to wait for our bag to be brought up. We observed everyone else being guided to their rooms with their bags and information given about the hotel as we drank our coffee earlier.  
We went to the pool for 6pm. We waited in the seating area so we could be shown to the pool. Be aware that the sauna, steam room, etc are not in use due to Covid 19 but we were made aware of this when booking over the phone. Within 5 minutes there were 14 people in the pool which meant we all huddled in pairs along the pool edge bar one woman who was lucky enough to create a lane. Perhaps the hotel should look at staggering times further as 14 people getting into the pool together was not an enjoyable experience especially if you want to enjoy a swim. 
We had dinner in the bar that evening and it was very enjoyable.
Breakfast was very good the following morning. There is a reduced buffet due to Covid restrictions so it looks more bare than usual but we had enough choice. Everything is individually wrapped - cereal, pastries, juices, etc.
That day we did the Bray to Greystones Cliff Walk and on our return around 4pm housekeeping had not been to our room. I called reception who told me they are only doing housekeeping on request due to Covid restrictions. I requested some items and a member of the housekeeping team arrived with coffee and towels. Please be aware that you only get one bottle of shampoo, conditioner, shower gel, etc. I asked the housekeeping member if she could possibly just dress the bed and take the old towels. She was very accommodating and organised this for us. I understand the hotel is trying to protect its staff but I really feel a reduced housekeeping option should be given especially in a hotel of this calibre. We were told on arrival that the turn down service was no longer available which is understandable given the amount of time needed to clean rooms now but no housekeeping at all? I feel guests should be given the option to opt in or opt out of housekeeping on check in. Maybe we missed this information as our room wasn't ready on arrival and we were just the unlucky ones. 
On the second night we had dinner in Sika restaurant which was very enjoyable. The people dining either side of us were frustrated that it wasn't clear on the menu that sides were included in the price of the dinner and complained to waiting staff. Given that it was a set menu we didn't question it but it must not have been clear to everyone. 
We went for a swim the following morning and this time there was just one other person in the pool which meant we could actually swim. It was very enjoyable. 
I know the hotel has just reopened after lockdown and there may be some teething issues but the wait for the room, the lack of space in the pool and housekeeping on request only impacted negatively on my experience of what I thought was a fantastic five star hotel. I understand that the hotel is doing what it can to protect its staff and guests - plenty of sanitiser, social distancing in the bar and the restaurant, masks worn by staff not protected by perspex screens, bookings for breakfast, dinner and pool so there isn't a massive influx of people at one time but I was genuinely upset by some the experiences that occurred during my stay. I just hope this review makes people more aware of the new normal.",3,2020,07,10
217,Appalling  ,"First visit after lockdown on 4th of July, present for my parents. 

Pool water was cold not be used... minor
Only toiletries 1 bar of soap and 1 shampoo ... 2 guests ... minor
Room had foul smelling odour from pillows ...

Breakfast was horrible, choice was there and we understand the restrictions due to COVID 19 but mum asked for some brown bread and was told “what is wrong with white bread” and turned his back and left. The food quality very disappointing ... 

And to top it all the room rate was charged twice and an extra 100€ deposit as they used a debit card. Received phone call from bank saying that hotel is trying to charge them again ...

We were planning on holding a family event in the hotel but needless to say that we have changed our minds.

Not a 5 star hotel anymore ...",1,2020,07,07
217,Relaxing weekend,"Stayed here a couple of times in a mountain view suite and loved it each time, its not far from Dublin City and being able to get to somewhere so remaking in about 30 minutes is fantastic! The rooms were beautiful, comfortable and quiet! We ate in the bar and the food was delicious. It can be expensive but you so get a great service and it was exactly what I was looking for!",4,2020,05,09
217,Not what I was expecting,Was over priced for what it was. Our room smelled and had a leak down the walls. When we complained honestly felt they didnt care. Spent huge money for probably the most disappointing experience I have had in a hotel. ,1,2020,04,24
217,Simply stunning,"Our weekend started off awfully with flights being cancelled on the day we were meant to travel to Turkey! 

Luckily, we were able to get a booking at Powerscourt! We stayed in a Mountain View suite! OMG, the room is amazing, spacious and came with the most spectacular views. 

The room has also got some really cool tech in the ways we can operate the lights, temperature, etc. 

The bathroom feels so luxurious and you could genuinely fall asleep in the bath tub! 

The grounds are immaculate and the whole place is just so picturesque and great for a walk. 

The Spa and gym were amazing and really gave us a great opportunity to relax. 

Finally and last but not the least, the people. Sarah who was there for check in and out was brilliant! For guys who had flights cancelled on arrival and a last minute flight on checkout, she really assisted us very well and was empathetic. 

Tatu, the guest service agent was super helpful throughout our stay and drove us to Enniskerry village a couple of times. 

Liam Ryan was super friendly and accommodating and looked after us really well. 

And finally the assistant night manager Rohan. Special mention to him for assisting us over night. He is an asset to the team. 

Looking forward to my next visit there :)

217,New Favorite Hotel!!!,"The Powerscourt has not become my new favorite hotel!!!  The property is gorgeous!  The service is top-notch!  The food is scrumptious!  The rooms are so comfortable and the bathroom is amazing!!  I can't wait to go back.  We dined at McGill's Irish Pub, which was quaint and delicious.  We had afternoon tea in the Sugar Loaf lounge and really enjoyed the snacks as well.  But the best part was the included full breakfast.  The options were so impressive.  The weather was a bit rainy but we still managed to tour the Powerscourt House grounds.  Wow, it is gorgeous there!",5,2020,03,06
217,A Wonderful Stay !,"My friends and I had the most amazing stay here as a part of my friend's birthday. After being really politely welcomed upon our arrival, we went to get checked-in, where the reception staff was extremely nice and talkative, telling us of the various things we can do in the hotel itself but also on the grounds. We stayed on the 5th floor which had the most breathtaking view of the back gardens. The room itself was squeaky clean and we were presented with the most aesthetically pleasing arrangement of chocolates. After spending some time at the pool which was an incredibly relaxing experience, we enjoyed the most lovely and delicious dinner in the lounge. The staff was very attentive where the manager, Cristian looked after us and had surprised my friend who's birthday is was, with a lovely desert which said 'happy birthday' on it. Ultimately our stay was more than satisfactory.",5,2020,03,03
217,Overcharged and stressed,"I do not know where to begin. Our stay has been totally ruined by being overcharged by over €1,000 and no one person taking responsibility to sort it out. I have had emails from at least 4 different people who have not got to the bottom of this. I am so stressed out two weeks after our stay. Different people replying to my emails and no one seems to be dealing with our issue of having charges deducted wrongly. This stay has cost much more than it should have. I’m not sure what way their finance system works Or how they have been told to deal with complaints but it’s definitely confusing and works in the hotels favour. I will not return as the stress this has caused is greater than any relaxation I felt whilst at the hotel.",1,2020,03,03
217,Love,"First I'd like to say that we have stayed several times in this hotel and loved it each time. The view from breakfast is amazing, especially as the fog travels over the greens early in the morning. The food is good, the pub is amazing and the rooms are immaculate. Can be a bit pricey but it's worth it for a special occasion - also, let them know why you are there and they cater to your special day (ours was a birthday and then an anniversary).",5,2020,02,27
217,Lovely stay here in January!,"Stayed here on the weekend of the 8th/9th January! It was a brilliant stay, lovely hotel, food and service. 
Service from the start was really friendly, Tatu was extremely pleasant and helpful, and the wait staff at dinner and breakfast were extremely attentive. 
It was my sisters birthday and they presented us with prosecco and an extra dessert for her at dinner which was a nice touch. The food was very nice, and was presented well.
Room was what you would expect in a five star hotel.. lovely decor and bathroom, very comfortable bed and the Nespresso machine made a nice addition! 
Breakfast was nice, it’s a buffet style which usually can be a bit hit and miss but I couldn’t fault it, the selection was great, fresh, high quality food..I particularly liked the addition of honeycomb which is not something you would usually find which made it unique. Overall really lovely hotel, couldn’t fault it! 
I would recommend to anyone staying to visit the Powerscourt Gardens nearby, as this was also a highlight of the stay! ",5,2020,02,25
217,You have arrived!,"I have been wanting to stay here for over a year and when we decided to head back to Ireland our travel plans were made to ensure we had at least 2 nights at this stunning hotel. Formerly a Ritz Carlton, now part of Marriott's Autograph Collection, you can defnitely see how it was a Ritz Carlton property.

We stayed at lovely hotels during this holiday but this was the ultimate best and  partly due to reserving a suite.  I suppose I expected it to be very nice but it blew us away. It was phenomenal!

We arrived in the evening and were welcomed warmly by the check in host. We stayed in Suite 640, upon entering the entrance hall there was a large closet to one side and a half bath on the other. You then enter the living room area with seating, writing desk and bar area.  We had a wonderful view of what we believe was Sugarloaf mountain. The adjacent bedroom had doors to close for privacy.  A very beautifully elegant marble bathroom with heated flooring, separate soaking tub, shower and toilet with bidet, all separately enclosed for privacy. The heated floors, marble, chrome, beveled glass, tub, shower, dual sinks were simply luxurious!  The moulding and even the door hardware was high end.  Adjacent to our king size bed was an elegant walk in closet with bench.  The access to the outside was from the living room with a slight step up to a huge walk out verandah overlooking the rear gardens, trees, fountain. Absolutely gorgeous.

The housekeeping staff was friendly, helpful, accommodating and left our room impeccable after turn down and cleaning. I noticed they had a team of two, perhaps the level of service, perhaps to provide adequate staff to clean a large suite but again the level of service on every level was impressive.

I will say we noticed a discoloration on the carpet in the bedroom so there was one thing that needed attention but did not impact or overshadow our wonderful stay. Also the closets could have used more hangers, there were very few for as much closet space provided. Being we only stayed two nights, this was not an issue but had we stayed longer we would have requested more.

Restaurant options were a bit  limited due to refurbishments but we didn't mind.  Traveling to Ireland in winter, we noticed that is when most of the upkeep or refurbishments take place. Service provided at dinner was good considering it may have been out of the norm to provide evening dining on the lobby level but the options were good and the staff helpful and attentive.

Breakfast offerings were excellent, host service was excellent. The host even took our jackets and stored them while we had breakfast before heading out to tour. Breakfast options were exceptional and plentiful.  

This is most definitely a wow property. If seeking privacy this may just be the place.
Lobby is impressive. By US standards this hotel is gorgeous and the suite was nicely appointed.  This is the type of property you only see upscale historic hotels or such properties in Europe. Definitely not the sterile cooker cutter sterility of chain hotels. More along the furnishings of high end suites you might see in the nicest resorts in Las Vegas (hate to use this comparison but it's the closest I can come up with by US standards others may related to) however with the European charm and flair that make this hotel unique, outstanding, one of a kind. 

We would definitely recommend the Powerscourt to everyone that is looking for a memorable and luxurious experience. Formerly a Ritz property, what more can I say.",5,2020,02,25
217,Outstanding hotel,"This is the nicest hotel we have ever stayed in, pure luxury. We stayed in a suite and it was outstanding, the bed was huge and so comfortable, we had a sofa and chair in the longe to sit and watch tv and the bathroom, wow. There was even a tv built into the mirror in the bathroom so you can lie in the bath watching. The balcony is huge and looks out over the beautiful hotel grounds and mountains in the distance, lovely to sit out with a drink or eat breakfast, ordered from room service.",5,2020,02,23
217,Excellent,"Had another enjoyable trip to this fabulous resort and enjoyed all the facilities especially the pool and spa. Wonderful location in natural woodland and always great to relax here. 
Food and staff very good.",5,2020,02,21
217,The best hotel in Ireland!,"This was my 8th trip to Powerscourt and by far my favorite hotel in the country. I've stayed in most all of the 5 star hotels and castles and I keep going back to Powerscourt. It's an easy drive from Dublin Airport and if you don't want to drive you can catch the Air Coach right outside the airport and it will take you to Bray where you can hop in a taxi and be there in 10 min. The setting is stunning, right in the middle of the Wicklow mountains. Lots to do and see in the area and the Powerscourt Estate and Gardens with a nice Avoca inside is a 5 minute walk. Lots of movies and tv shows filmed in the area and you will instantly see why as it's a lovely part of Ireland. The hotel staff is top notch and there is really nothing you could ask of them that they wouldn't do for you. The restaurant and lounge on the main floor is a great place for lunch with a view. The pub downstairs has great live music and a local Irish crowd. Splurge for a Mountain View suite and you will never want to leave your room.",5,2020,02,17
217,Style over substance.,"We came to Powerscourt for 2 nights, 14th & 15th Feb.  Powerscourt is marketed as a luxury hotel and while there's no doubt that the hotel itself and the grounds are beautiful, what we experienced in terms of service fell far short.  

There were problems with housekeeping & room service (room not being re-stocked, room service arriving with half the pieces missing), but the main issue was on the second night where we had no hot water for hours, starting at 5pm.  The water ran cold when I was in the shower at 5pm, getting ready for our 6.30pm dinner reservation (which happened to be for my birthday). 

I contacted reception where the lady thanked me for notifying them and put down the phone.  No apology, no expectation setting. I called back immediately, and was told that someone would be in touch asap. 

30 mins later there was still no update and I called again, and again was told someone would call me back.  Someone DID call me back this time, and advised that as the hotel was busy they'd ran out of hot water (?!) but they had 'fired up another boiler' and we should have hot water in 10 mins.  

20 mins later, still no hot water.  I called reception again (note:  at no point did anyone call back to apologise or check that the water was working properly for us), and asked to make a complaint to someone. I was told someone would call me back in '2 minutes'.  This was at 6pm.

At 6.25pm I called reception again and demanded to speak to someone as no one had called me back and we STILL had no hot water.  I should add that by this point, I had been sat with soaking wet hair for 1.5 hours at 16 weeks' pregnant, and we'd already missed our dinner reservations – not an acceptable customer experience.

A manager then called me back and I found them to be defensive, condescending and unapologetic.  He did agree to credit us for the second night's stay, but there was no apology for or acknowledgement of the bad service, bad facilities, bad experience and the impact that this had on our evening.  My advice for a luxury weekend nearby  is to spend your money in Monart where in my experience guest experience actually matters",1,2020,02,17
217,Horrified,"What a disappointment. We booked to stay for 2 nights and unfortunately after 4 hours on the first day we where forced to check out. After a short trip to the more than basic spa covered in mould we where horrified that the hotel does not provide hot Water. After 4 hours of constant phone calls, engineers and trips to reception we where left with a ruined weekend away. The hotel failed to provide us with an outcome to the situation. Telling us that there nothing more we can do. I would of preferred to stay at home.No room change available therefore we where forced to LEAVE and make a 4 hour journey back home. What a DISGRACE.  This is not a 5* hotel, this hotel does not provide 5* amenities and it sure does not provide 5* customer service.",1,2020,02,16
217,Very poor birthday surprise weekend,"I’ve stayed here several times before and loved it so my wife chose this hotel for my 50th birthday surprise weekend. 

Maybe they are a victim of their own success as everything was very busy resulting in standards far below 5 star in our opinion.

The room temperature was set too cold and despite saying there were instructions in the room regarding how to amend it, there was no information to be found.

The evening meal was ok however the scallop starter only contained one tiny scallop, the steak was too fatty and the cheese board only had a small teaspoon of relish for 3 pieces of cheese and crackers. At the end of the meal I was presented with a bill for the entire meal despite already having purchased an “escape” package.  This was fixed quickly enough but shouldn’t happen in a 5 star. 

Breakfast was a disaster, which was the biggest disappointment as it’s normally excellent.  Several of the buffet trays were nearly empty and almost all of the buffet items I selected were cold when I went to eat them. My wife’s were cold too. The couple beside us both ordered poached eggs - one got served after about 5 minutes but the other plate took about 20+ minutes to arrive which was very poor. Surely a couple eating together should be served together?? 

Checkout wasnbedlam. 

I don’t know if we struck a bad weekend or if things have really gone downhill as previously this was our favorite Irish hotel.  At over €500 for one night we expected far better. ",1,2020,02,15
217,Relaxing weekend ,"We had a lovely time ...staff are very friendly and professional.  We used all facilities even gym and bicycles although the bike experience was  rather short lived due to strong winds ! 
River walk was beautiful even in the midst of a storm.

We availed of room service as well as sugar loaf grill ..all lovely food and smooth service. 

Our room 636 had an issue which was dealt with quickly and efficiently.  

Look forward to our next weekend there ...

217,Ms Niamh Mc Kenna,We had a fabulous time at our overnight break in powerscourt hotel. The service was impeccable and although busy with the rugby match on we opted for the in room service which I couldn't fault one bit. We did use all the facilities at the pool and in the espa spa. Would certainly recommend.,5,2020,02,12
217,Sliding Standards,"We had a two night stay at Powerscourt recently, it was not our first time.
We checked in approx 15:30 and that took 30 minutes between queuing and actually getting the room.
The bar was full (so no food) as the Ireland v Wales rugby was on TV so we had food in the upper restaurant, that took over an hour to get food as we had to wait 45 minutes for a table.
Service and food quality was excellent.

Next morning we were ever so disappointed with breakfast. The hotel advertises 5 star and a buffet breakfast is presented. I would like to say that all was fresh, far from it. I’ll leave it at that.

It was a wet and windy weekend, we went out for a bit, came back at 5pm, we had to ask for housekeeping to make up the room. That was done at 6pm, not good enough.

Dinner that night in the main restaurant, excellent service and food quality.

We decided not to have the buffet breakfast on Monday morning, had a coffee in the bar and checked out at 11:30 and that took another 40 minutes as only one receptionist working, she said the other was working since 6am so she had to have lunch.

There is not much to do locally on a wet and miserable day, resulting in the hotel dining areas bursting and not enough seating/tables.
Housekeeping and Reception also seem to have staff shortages.

When we checked in on Saturday evening there were 2 food trolley with leftovers parked on the hall to the bedrooms, they were still there + one more when we checked out on Monday.

The hotel is in a fabulous location, very well finished/decorated and extremely clean but not a 5 star service.

On another issue, for gifts etc we ask for Blue Book or request a certain hotel vouchers.
We had and stated to receptionist that we have €700 in vouchers but she continued to debit my card of €600. Why? Hotel policy I was told.

All in all, not good enough.",2,2020,02,11
217,"Beautiful hotel, but buffet breakfast in a 5 star?","We’ve been to Powerscourt a few times and it truly is a beautiful hotel. Great location, fantastic surroundings, top quality spa and gym.
Rooms are very high quality and everything about the hotel is 5 star look and feel. The ‘Irish bar’ is a lovely addition with a real authentic feel of a pub, whilst in the comfort of your hotel.
Meal in the restaurant was in our opinion only ‘ok’. Fussy for fussy sake. It’s expensive which is to be expected for such an establishment but I felt the food was only average, certainly not bad, but neither was it memorable. 
We find a buffet breakfast in a 5 star hotel to be unacceptable and generally opt for the hotels where we know it’s a table service. This should be the minimum acceptable for the cost. Whatever about the hot food, making your own toast is a small point but a real annoyance. 
The service at breakfast was quite poor. Didn’t appear to be enough staff and the waiters seemed to avoid any eye contact so as not to be asked to do anything. We were not once asked 
If everything was ok, nothing was cleared from our table and after trying for 10 min ( I checked) to get attention of staff for more tea, eventually my wife stood up and walked over to a waiter to request same. It still didn’t come and we had to ask again if it had been forgotten. When it was eventually delivered the table still wasn’t cleared even though we were obviously finished. 
This wouldn’t stop us going again, it’s beautiful and definitely worth a visit, but had service been at the levels it should be, we’d give the 5 stars to the 5 star establishment. ",4,2020,02,08
217,Sika Restaurant was very disappointing and overpriced,"We stayed two nights in January. The hotel is lovely but is let down by the restaurant. The dinner was extremely pretentious but was poorly cooked and not tasty.
The only course that lived up to expectations was dessert. I definitely will not return!",2,2020,02,06
217,Wonderful Stay!,"We had a wonderful stay for my husband's 30th Birthday, I booked through the Black Friday deal in December which included a room upgrade and breakfast. 

The service was excellent, spa was lovely, restaurant perfect. Everything you would expect and more from a 5 star hotel

Thank you for a fantastic stay",5,2020,02,03
217,A big let down...5 Star Hotel with 1 Star Service,"Weekend away without the kids, for my birthday, much anticipated special weekend on which we spent around €1200 in total!!! This was a massive extravagance for us, but we assumed we would be looked after. But the reality is that the hotel is a 5 star hotel with 1 star service. I'd hold off going until the staff receive extensive training to be honest. To start with we booked a Courtyard room with king bed and paid for same. We did not get this, we had view of a wall with and overgrown flower bed (if that what it even was). We went back to reception and were told that the Courtyard is under renovation so they were diverting guests away from it in case of noise - which is fine but I feel they should have told us this when we booked and paid for it, and they had another opportunity to tell us upon check-in but they said nothing. We had to go back and they changed our room and we were given a room with a mountain view which my husband confirmed to the manager that brought him to the room that was fine, but he didn't notice at the time that we did not get the king bed, but two small double beds. We had lunch and Spa booked so we did not go back to reception for a second time as we just wanted to get on with our weekend and forget about it, we assumed everything else would be wonderful, it wasn't. The rest of the weekend was also awful in terms of service. I won’t detail all of the failings we experienced as the list is long but was everything from very very slow service, to cold food in the Sika restaurant to the pub that had run out of two different beers (which were on tap). Ordered a side of tender stem broccoli with our meal (€5 extra I might add)....and they serve you raw regular broccolli!!! Room service knocking on the door before breakfast asking to clean the room! 
The Food & Beverage manager has been in touch with me since I sent an email to hotel, he has apologized and he agreed that they fell far short on this occasion. I requested he refunded our evening meal due to such a poor experience and he did so, but it would have been unacceptable not to do so given the experience we had. We were not asked on check out how our stay was as I would have liked to tell them what I thought at that point so it was only after that I emailed to explain how our weekend was ruined. My husband and I slept in separate beds given the lack of King bed we booked in the room. A 5 Star hotel should get these things right, we hated having to go to reception to ask to be moved the first time, never mind having to go back again. 
I asked that the accommodation manager ring me and to be honest the outcome of that call has made me even more annoyed, I wouldn't have written this review if I felt he understood and agreed that we did not get anything like the 5 Star treatment we should have. He offered us a discount on a room if we came back again after I told him we would never go back. He tried to justify the failings by saying the room we got was a Courtyard room as it’s a 'partial side view' but there was no Courtyard in site AND when we went back to reception we were told they were not putting guests in those rooms due to renovations. I didn't expect a full refund on our accommodation but I did expect a small token/gesture as an apology but it wasn't forthcoming and unfortunately this has made me even more annoyed as we booked this 5 star hotel, to have a 5 star experience and it fell far short, they know this, but really I've been told that 'there is nothing they can do only hope we come back so they can serve us again and show us how nice the experience can be'. Needless to say we won’t be going back. Do your research before staying here, although the hotel is beautiful, cant fault it - if you want good service and high standards I'd choose somewhere else. If this had been a 4 star hotel, I may have just let it go but for the cost of this 'luxury' hotel, I expected excellent service and to get what we paid for which we didn't get and even more so, the follow up left has left a very sour taste!",1,2020,01,30
217,Avoid the restaurant,"Stayed at this beautiful hotel Dec 24th & 25th. The hotel was generally magnificent, top class rooms and staff so friendly. Rooms €1000 approx for 2 nights.

However there is a big BUT... The restaurant’s food was terrible and not fitting for its beautiful surroundings.  
We paid €190 per person for Christmas dinner. 
My partners main was Turkey and ham, which arrived in a  hybrid version that came in a small circular portion that looked like processed turkey and ham, with stuffing all fused into one. Sort of how a ready made meal may look in Iceland or Tesco

Call me old fashioned, but who would not like traditional real turkey and ham slices with tasty stuffing. 

I ate a fish dish that was unremarkable and tasteless. 

On my check out i informed management of my discontent  of meal. Mr H... was the manager on duty that was friendly who said he would revert back to me in the forthcoming days but never did. ( i have not put his full name in review out of courtesy)",2,2020,01,26
217,Beautiful hotel with absolutely beautiful views.,"Just back from a fabulous nights stay in Powerscourt with a group of friends. All of the staff were so lovely on arrival and all of our rooms were ready. 
 The hotel is so beautiful our room was over looking the courtyard. It was extremely spacious. There is a tv in the bathroom but unfortunately ours was not working. 
We were booked in for afternoon tea which I wouldn’t recommend. The service was absolutely awful for a five star. 
 There was 11 of us having afternoon tea and it came out at different times, we waited for an hour and 15 minutes for it to arrive we had to ask for more tea and for €45 a head in my opinion isn’t worth it.  
But we had an absolutely amazing stay. 
We had food in the pub that night. Which was so good. 
Breakfast the next morning was amazing. There was such a selection of food and all of the staff were so lovely. 
We had an amazing stay in the hotel and would definitely go back.",4,2020,01,24
217,Fabulous,"Had a lovely night in this gorgeous hotel. Room was beautiful, great size, very comfy. Nice size bathtub but the water wasn’t hot enough for my liking. Lovely nespresso coffee in the room. Good view from the balcony. 
For dinner we went down to McGills lounge. This is the only reason I’ve marked down the hotel. It was very busy when we went down, and there was no system in place for keeping track of the tables. Two parties that arrived after us were seated first. I did mention this to the staff member in charge of tables but nothing could really be done but have us wait. Would be no harm to take names on arrival in place of a reservation system. Food was tasty though. 
Breakfast the next morning was fab! Buffet style hot breakfast, along with the continental. Delicious breads and pastries. 
After check out we made use of the complimentary bike hire which was a very enjoyable way to explore the surrounding grounds.
Overall would recommend.",4,2020,01,23
217,Spa Day,"I feel the need to write a review of my Spa Day experience for 3 reasons:
1. The Spa therapists were amazing !
2.The Spa lunch was utterly disappointing!
3.Received no response from my email explaining my disappointing Spa Day.....
I would not recommend the Powerscourt Espa experience particularly because the lunch was served in a tray box, poor presentation, poor service and no comparison with the luxury of the therapy treatments and the spa facilities.
The Spa Day was planned for my daughter's birthday.......expecting a wonderful, luxury day!",2,2020,01,14
217,"Beautiful Hotel, service not great ","My friend and I stayed in Powerscourt for one night (a Sunday). Upon arrival we were met at the front desk by a receptionist who was courteous but lacked any kind of personality, she didn't smile once and was completely robotic. She didn't tell us anything about the hotel other than where our room was and we had to ask everything as we went along.
We had tried to book spa treatments weeks previously but it was fully booked. They never advised us of the facility to pay to use the thermal suite which we  would certainly have taken advantage of. 
We had booked for this time as the info said no children in there after 8pm, there was a fairly newborn baby at the seating next to us. He cried occasionally (as babies do) and they walked around with him and did their best to calm him. However, we were having a very rare night away from our kids and didn't expect to listen to this at dinner.
Service was slow, they forgot one side dish, they never returned with desert menus, we were not offered tea or coffee. We got fed up waiting so we walked to the desk, paid our bill and left. Not the experience we had expected. Food was good but overall experience took from that.
Checkout was fine, we got the same staff member who wasn't any brighter that day but the concierge made up for that. They were super. Very friendly and helpful. They brought my car to the door as it was raining and had a very natural friendly manner, honestly these guys saved the day as we left with a happy feeling because of them. Reception staff that we encountered could do with taking a few lessons from them.
The room was fabulous and I would love to stay again however I wouldnt book into the restaurant and would hope to have a better check in experience. A little work could make a huge difference here. ",3,2020,01,14
217,Very poor. Not a five star experience,"We went for an overnight stay on 28 December. We were extremely disappointed with the stay for numerous reasons. The spa was overcrowded and full of kids. We were unaware of the kids hours until we arrived in our robes to use the pool. Dinner in the sugar loaf lounge was extremely over priced, very mediocre food (the veg option is pathetic). Service was friendly but very inexperienced. Food in the bar also over priced and poor. Breakfast disappointing and overcrowded. An average buffet and not what yky woild expect from a hotel of this rating. Overall was not worth the money. Would not return. Raised all of our issues on checkout and received a token apologetic email a week later. The only positives were the setting and the room which was very spacious. Overall however would not recommend if you're looking for luxury experience.",2,2020,01,12
217,ANNIVERSARY CELEBRATION,Having visited Powerscourt hotel on many occasions yet again it outshines any other hotel.  From check in to check out the experience was an absolute pleasure cant wait to get back. On a customer services observation - many thanks to Barbara who replied to my original glowing review,5,2020,01,11
217,Amazing birthday weekend,"We stayed for two nights at powerscourt hotel to celebrate my husbands 40th birthday and it was truly fantastic. Not only is the location and the hotel itself stunning the staff were outstanding, in particular Daniel O’Connor went above and beyond to make our stay perfect from the minute we arrived at check in and throughout our  stay. The food was fabulous and we enjoyed the coziness of the pub both nights. The rooms are luxurious and what you would expect of a 5 star hotel. We really enjoyed our stay, it was the perfect escape with the extra elegance that made it a birthday to remember. Once again the luxury provided would be nothing without the friendliness of the staff, thank you Daniel.",5,2020,01,10
217,Powerscourt review,"“I stayed in powerscourt over the weekend a few weeks back with my friend, we booked a spa package and overnight with bed and breakfast. We got a room straight away on arrival which was great because our treatment was booked 30 minutes after our arrival so we had time to freshen up. The facilities were fantastic and I have booked a January package for my mother and I to return because of this. 
We had dinner in mcgills pub that night and the bar manager was 10/10 he served us cocktails that were not on the menu, great service!!!
For breakfast we met Daniel who looked after what seemed like a very busy breakfast morning with guests and he was able to attend to every guest and ensure service did not drop once! He came over to us and even remembered us from check in and asked how our spa treatment was. He is a credit to the hotel! Upon check out a wonderful woman Mika who we saw on check in and check out helped us with our bags, she is brilliant! 
Thank you Daniel and Mika for making our stay one to remember, I’ll be back with my mother at the end of the month and really look forward to it!”",5,2020,01,10
217,Ruined a great family wedding,"An absolutely scandalous course of events .. reserved  3 rooms for myself sisters and husbands, they then messed up numerous times on my sisters extending their stay to 2 nights. Rebooked then two different rooms and charged them AND charged me for three rooms as 2 “ no shows” when all three couples were in hotel..! Nobody in hotel ever tried to contact me as to where other guests were .. I was stating in hotel , they had room number.. phone number .. email..! They took €410 from account on Sunday morning at 9am without even contacting me . Nor to date , ( 5 days later) have I received a receipt , I used their express check out and was told receipt would be emailed that day.. they refuse to refund  so I’m going legal route. STAY AWAY FOLKS.! Booking is badly flawed .",1,2020,01,10
217,Lovely hotel but manic,"The Powerscourt hotel is in a perfect location and a lovely spot to visit. We stay here over Christmas and although the hotel is lovely, the public areas were completely manic throughout our stay, which seriously detracted from the enjoyment . 
When we arrived at 4pm our room wasn't ready and there were a ton of people in the lobby and lounge area either checking out, checking in or enjoying afternoon tea. We were asked to take a seat and wait for them to call us when the room was ready. We eventually got a spot to sit down in the bar on the lower level. After waiting for over an hour and a half for the call (which never came) I went back to the front desk. Luckily the room was finally ready and we were able to go to the our room at 6pm. The room itself was beautiful, spotlessly clean and extremely comfortable. 
We had dinner in the bar on the lower level which again was absolutely packed. The food and service was good but it was hard to enjoy being packed in like sardines. We decided to skip dessert in the bar and order room service instead, which was definitely the better option. The service was promote and waitress extremely polite and helpful.
We had a similar experience at breakfast the next morning, when we had to queue for a table and a lot of the breakfast buffet was empty due to the massive demand. The poor staff just couldn't keep up.  My advise would be avoid the breakfast buffet and get room service. It will be worth the extra money since your room is bound to be far nicer than the crush at the breakfast buffet.",4,2020,01,07
217,Fab,"Really enjoyed this hotel  - stayed 3 nights for work. Rooms are fab. Beds comfortable, great breakfast, fabulous swimming pool. Staff were kind and friendly and lovely walks near by. Didn’t have dinner there.",5,2020,01,06
217,Lovely Xmas break!,Stayed for 2 nights at Powerscourt Hotel and was pleasantly surprised by the lovely refurbishment of the lobby and breakfast/dinner room. The breakfast buffet is now moved to another area and the quality of the food has gone up. the staff was lovely as always. Would definitely recommend to all nature lovers as the walks and cycles are great. ,4,2020,01,06
217,Disappointing ,We stayed at this hotel over the new year period and overall it was very disappointing. We had stayed here before but the standards and levels of service have dropped significantly since our last visit. I’m afraid from check in to when we left it was really poor. We had a superior room with what we were told was a garden view which was very ordinary.  It is certainly not upto what you would expect from 5 star hotel charging 5 star prices. Needs to improve before we go back again. ,2,2020,01,06
217,Just ok for the price.,"Great location with lots of good walking within the Powerscourt grounds.
Overall Im afraid though it just felt a bit jaded which was a shame as we were really looking forward to it- we had booked a one bedroom suite and the room was really dark- we asked about additional lighting but it didnt materialise. The furnishings felt aged although bathroom was fine.
The spa felt like a bit of a production line and one of the dry areas was covered in water. However the treatments were good and the therapist friendly.
The lady at check in wasn't  friendly at all- actually quite stern.
Dinner in the restaurant was excellent.
Overall though the hotel was a disappointment.",3,2020,01,05
217,Disappointed,"Booked a 2 night stay for my partner expecting a great experience but was left hugely unimpressed with the service! 

Arrived to check in where I stood for 30 mins in a queue to check in so immediately I’m irritated. Whilst in the queue I spoke to 2 other customers who advised they were waiting for 2 hours for their room to be cleaned! Clearly they cannot handle heavy volumes of people 

Get to the room to which was lovely but had the luxury of looking into a bank & a concrete pulled wall, not what I’m looking for at €360 a night!!

The overall building is lovely but the courtyards at the back of the building look as if a grounds man hasn’t looked at these in years! Dead shrubbery and filthy walls and seating areas!!

The first morning we get a bag on the door from room service asking when we want the room cleaned which I have never been asked anywhere before. I suggested around 14.00 to where I got a tut response had basically told it would be 12.00

We go down to the sugar loaf restaurant where there is a sign saying wait to be seated. The woman at the entrance sees us waiting but carries on with doing something. Then after approx 5-10 mins standing there another member of staff brings us down! After ordering we wait 35 mins for food to come, I can understand this if it’s busy or I ordered a well done steak but it wasn’t busy & I ordered a rare steak sandwich!! The waiter then forgets my drinks order where we had to ask a waitress again to get!! These things you shouldn’t expect in a supposedly 5 star hotel!!

On check out I wasn’t asked how my stay was otherwise I would be saying all this then!!

In an overview I was very disappointed in the service of a beautiful place. I don’t mind paying extra & getting extra but I think the service here is struggling to make a 4 star. I must say the Espa was excellent and is the only positive I can can say along with the stunning setting. 

It’s a beautiful place but it is safe to say I would not recommend nor will I be back",2,2020,01,04
217,A special hotel,Fantastic one night break pre-Christmas to unwind. Super friendly staff and a superior room which will be hard to beat. Absolutely recommend as we found no fault in the breakfast or pre-booked dinner. The bar is a nice touch also,5,2020,01,02
217,Booking Spa Treatments ,"I went into The Powerscourt Hotel on the 26th of December to book some spa treatments for my brother and I. I walked through the main reception space and the decorations were beautiful and festive! When I arrived in the ESPA, I was greeted by Megan at the reception who was extremely helpful, really knowledgeable about treatments, payment options and the spa in general. Made everything very easy with no hassle! Looking forward to the treatments! ",5,2019,12,30
217,Nice hotel but other 5 stars are much better,"Visited 29&30 December 2019 when the hotel was very busy and hectic making it very difficult to find a seat to relax and enjoy the lobby / lounge area. You have to hang around and pounce on a chair when someone leaves! I do understand it’s peak season with the holidays but then you are also paying peak season money so should be able to enjoy it! 
I had emailed in advance to have a small gesture provided for my wife (happy to pay for it) as we were celebrating 10 years married - they had emailed back saying no problem but nothing happened. 2 more emails sent while we were staying with no reply. 
Room lovely overall but upon arrival I knew immediately the queen beds in our room were way too small for 2 adults and would have 2 bad nights sleep ahead. (Perfect for the children). Never seen such a small bed in a 5 star before. Asked for a king room with roll away beds but was told it would be another €200 for the 2 small beds, apparently the roll away beds are “better than a camp bed” so justify a load of extra money to set up in the room - after paying €790 for the room already which I felt was more than enough as it was so stayed as we were. Poor sleep was had.
Grounds nice overall but very surprising dirty as you walk down to the main fountain area (see photos). 
McGills bar was very uninviting and we left after 1 drink as there was zero atmosphere - cold and dark. 
This is my first negative online review as I usually “let it go” when a place isn’t perfect but this place is so expensive I really thing it should be great. Apologies for long review.
Staff are very nice and overall the hotel is a fantastic building but the details let it down IMO. 
",2,2019,12,30
217,Not Impressed ,"Stayed here over the holidays, we booked 4 rooms months ago and not one of them was on the same floor (which seems very strange to me). We requested one near the lift and there wasn’t a lift anywhere near our rooms. 

For such a large hotel there is nowhere to sit and relax and enjoy views without paying for something apart from in your bedroom (the majority of which only have one comfortable chair in a very large room - the other chair is a desk chair) unless you are in a suite where there are plenty of places to sit. 

Most of the rooms were updated but one wasn’t, it had lumpy old uncomfortable mahogany beds with mattresses that dipped in the middle but we were still charged the same price! 

The bar downstairs is like a dungeon with no windows or views, its so dark, dated and shabby. It needs so badly to be changed from the 80’s into something glamorous and befitting of a five star hotel.

We had morning coffees overlooking the mountain and my family charged it to one of our rooms but it never went on the system, the waitress was very, very assertive in getting me to pay for all the coffees thankfully I had my purse with me but it was embarrassing for me when it should have been on the system as requested. 

The young servers in the main Restaurant badly need training in serving food and wine, dinner is overpriced at €75 for a set menu. If you only want two courses you still pay €75, there is nothing else to choose from. There is no sommelier to properly present or serve expensive wines which ended up being dribbled all over the table when being poured.

€28 for breakfast where complete families came to breakfast in their pyjamas mostly without dressing gowns!!!! Straight from bed to the breakfast buffet - did they even wash their hands? How hygienic is that and staff don’t even batt an eyelid. Breakfast was more like a scene from a holiday camp than a five star hotel. 

We spent a lot of money but we won’t be rushing back again this hotel is so disappointing nowadays compared to the type of hotel it used to be. 

We hope its relatively new owners will bring it back up to the higher standards it used to be renowned for in both facilities and service but seriously you should NOT be charging five star prices until this is done. ",1,2019,12,30
217,Buckley/ O Rourke Christmas Stay,Our 3rd year staying over Xmas. As usual fantastic. Quick Check in great suite plenty of Room. Christmas dinner we normally have the buffet however we decided table service in Sika absolutely beautiful meal. Service flawless. Brekkie lovely again with great service. Santa visited on Xmas day and provided our daughter with a lovely pressie which she loved.  Tv froze in room and was fixed within 10minutes. 2019 flawless stay highly reccomend,5,2019,12,27
217,What a experience,"My husband and I went to Powers Court Hotel as my husband was going to receive an award from the ISIA security sector  and what a night we had it went on till 5 am after a fantastic meal with dj playing music through the night and after we went up to the main part of the hotel and sat by this big fire place with beautiful soft music playing highly recommend  
5+ star hotel, 5+ star accommodation,",5,2019,12,27
217,Christmas Dinner rip-off,"Couldn’t have been more disappointed with the whole experience. Not even xmas music being played in the background at Sika restaurant, zero atmosphere.  Then the awful food..... no provision for younger family diners on the menu, sent back undercooked Brussels sprouts and raw parsnips. At €180 per head think again.  Try Ashford or similar for true 5*",1,2019,12,25
217,Very Enjoyable ,"Had a one night stay here last weekend and really enjoyed it, wish I could have stayed longer. The suite was lovely, spacious, well appointed and feels luxurious . The bar is cosy with excellent service. The Sika restaurant is decorated beautifully. The breakfast was really good with lots of choice. Had a facial treatment in the spa which was fantastic! Probably the best one I’ve had, definitely recommend doing a treatment if you stay. 

Few niggles that I really hope the hotel will take on board:

Parking - when you arrive it’s not clear if there is valet parking or not. Drove to the main entrance and there was no one there so parked ourselves and then saw staff parking cars for people. Literally just one sign saying valet parking would work

The windows - it’s a little disappointing that the windows were filthy given that it’s been mentioned in so many reviews. Get it sorted guys! I was in the spa in the warm  bubbly pool with my boyfriend when it started to snow outside and it would have been a ‘moment’ if the windows weren’t so filthy!

Dinner - I hate to say it but you need to change your head chef. The menu is dated and a bit bland, and as others have mentioned too many creams and mousses and it just gives the impression of imitating a fine dining restaurant rather than being one. This is holding you back from being a ‘destination’ hotel

Overall though it was really wonderful and would recommend it to anyone, as I said I wish I could have stayed longer and will e back!

217,Afternoon tea delight,Spent a gorgeous afternoon here for Xmas afternoon tea. Vegetarian menu provided and beautiful savouries and sweets. The food and service was amazing. Stunning views of the Sugarloaf. Will definitely be back.,5,2019,12,17
217,Beyond Expectations this place is incredible,I would highly recommend staying at the Powerscourt Hotel. The staff is so friendly and accommodating and make sure that you have the best time on your holiday. They go above and beyond for you! The rooms are absolutely incredible with wonderful views of the countryside. The food is amazing and the spa is hands-down one of the best spas in the world!! Stephen at the front desk is wonderful and ensures you have an amazing holiday! Thank you Powerscourt for an incredible experience! I will be back again soon!,5,2019,12,17
217,Great hotel,"Amazing hotel in fact one of the best I've stayed in, check-in was super and mcgills bar and food is a little gem. Room was great and spacious, but as said before mattress need replacing ASAP wore out and very uncomfortable.

Breakfast was beautiful loads of options. 

Would defo recommend and hope to return very soon.",5,2019,12,16
217,Brilliant hotel but issues with housekeeping,"-Location: Brilliant, tranquil surroundings, not too far from Dublin, but has all the advantages of a countryside location

- Hotel: the hotel is beautiful and very well maintained, nicely furnished, loved the fire places in the lobby

-Rooms: We had a Suite. The suits are beautiful and spacious. The furniture is generally well maintained BUT the mattresses desperately need replacement! Sunken in on both sides! 

-Staff: The doormen, the staff at the reception as well as in room dining and the restaurant were very helpful, professional and friendly. Especially the man who helped us with our luggage and showed us around our room was more than friendly and welcoming!

-Housekeeping: The downside of the whole thing. The first day it was ok, but from the second day it went downhill. They didn't bother to make our son's bed (we had our own little bed for him with us but would have still been nice to at least entangle his blanket). It seemed as if the room was left in a hurry since the counter, where the coffee machine stands wasn't wiped, the drawer there was left open and the mini bar was not refilled and the floor wasn't vacuumed, only the towels were replaced and the double bed was made. Also the following days the mini bar was not restocked and they decided to ignore our son's bed entirely, which was a shame because the housekeeping has the possibility to make the guests feel so much at home. This was a bit of a miss.

GENERALLY: Despite the housekeeping we loved the hotel, the location, the room, the spa. The people were friendly and we would definitely come again if we decided to return to this area!",4,2019,12,12
217,Excellent!!!,"One of the best hotels  I have ever  stayed
Been there for three days, for a business company meeting.
The hotel is  luxurious, well equipped, service is excellent, wonderful view , the gardens near the hotel are breath taking!
The rooms are  huge!!!!  At least  3 times larger than  an average 5 stars hotel room.
Really enjoyed my staying there!!!",5,2019,12,11
217,Total relaxation,"Fabulous hotel staff just cant do enough !lt is expensive but worth every penny if your looking for somewhere to totally relax and have privacy this is the hotel for you! The suites are amazing spotless clean and so comfortable, breakfast was great and the bar food also ,beautiful pool and spa i would highly recommend this hotel .",5,2019,12,10
217,Wife's Birthday Celebration,"We stayed here on the 1st of December and booked the executive mountain view suite. The room was stunning and the view from the ground floor was amazing . We dined at the Sika restraunt and I couldn't fault the food, the service was a bit slow and I asked to ask twice for my wife's wine but it didn't take away from the experience again the nicest food ive had anywhere . The breakfast the following morning was very busy wide selection available at the buffet my only criticism over the stay was some of the meats were a little under cooked the bacon in particular and the  exterior of the building could do with a lick of paint . Over all a great experience I'd definelty return, and if you get the opportunity book the executive mountain view suite it's amazing .",4,2019,12,02
217,Simply the best!!!,"If we could give a 6 star rating, we would! This was one of the best hotel experiences we've ever had - The service and hospitality at Powerscourt was superlative. Me and my girlfriend just got engaged and the hotel went out of their way to ensure we had a memorable and special experience. Our large room with balcony was A+ and dinner at Sika restaurant was delicious. I have a gluten allergy and the servers were so accommodating. Even though it rained most of the time, we loved the grounds and breakfast was also excellent. We'd highly recommend this hotel, particularly if you are celebrating a special occasion.",5,2019,12,02
217,Extremely disappointing-beds very poor,"Having just returned from a short stay at powerscourt Hotel we were extremely disappointed & feel it is our duty to write a quick review based on our experience. We booked a mountain view room for 2 nite's including breakfast & one evening meal in the restaurant.We were celebrating our 10 year wedding anniversary and requested 2 double beds as we brought our 4 year old son with us.We were really looking forward to our stay & excited to see what this 5* had to offer. Whilst we were happy with the food & have nothing negative to report there that is where the enjoyment ended unfortunately. The standard of  mattresses on both beds in our room was appalling, we got the impression they were just completely worn out & needed to be thrown out. It beggars belief that a so called 5* hotel can survive with such poor standard of beds & that they see this as acceptable to residents paying high prices for the accommodation. To say they were old & sagging in the middle is an understatement.We have stayed in a wide range of different accommodation around the world ranging from basic hostels to higher end resorts & never have we had beds of such a poor standard. I actually ended up relocating to the floor during the nite as my limbs were crippled from trying to sleep on the bed! To add, I am also 6 months pregnant. In addition the rooms were not soundproofed to the level one would expect-residents next door to us were shouting & arguing & although we were both wearing ear plugs we could still hear this which was very unsettling. This went on til about 3.30 in the morning at which point my husband rang reception to inform them of the noise. It eventually stopped around this time.

In summary far from being relaxed, we were absolutely exhausted the next morning as we basically got no proper sleep all nite & subsequently we decided to check out after 1 nite although we had booked in for a 2 nite stay. We asked to speak to a manager & explained our situation to him. Although he did listen & apologise nothing could be done to persuade us to stay for the second nite or to change our opinion. We were so disappointed, what was supposed to be a relaxing break away turned into a nitemare & the sad thing is this was down to something very basic-bed quality. We do not usually complain but this was just so unacceptable, for even a basic 3* nevermind a 5* charging high rates and as a result we will not be returning anytime soon.",1,2019,12,02
217,"Disappointing return, service has dropped ","I picked this hotel for a family occasion and did not check the reviews as had a wonderful visit 18 months ago. Unfortunately the service level has clearly dropped and I am now sorry I chose this hotel. We arrived yesterday and were upgraded to a suite which was appreciated however the suite is rather worn with large scrape marks on the wooden floors. Also annoying that despite a family of four in the room there are only toiletries for one , I have had to call for extra yesterday and today. Absolutely terrible service in sugar loaf lounge , tea and coffee arrived and had to wait despite repeated requests for the milk and also scones ordered for about another 15 minutes. When I raised it with staff they just said very sorry. Returned there for an after dinner drink took about 25 minutes to get our drinks with mistakes from lounge staff , when the manager came over and we raised it he was not very engaging and said he would get us some snacks - two bowls of nuts appeared which is what you would expect anyway with the round being 82 euro for 5 people. Also a relation had called the hotel 4 times to try to order bottle of bubbly for me , several calls to get name and payment and then they called to say she had been charged three times in error !!! No way is this anyway near 5 star. Our family celebration is in the Sika tonight and just keeping fingers crossed that no more blunders 😟",2,2019,11,30
217,Anne OHerlihy,"Spectacular hotel, magnificent setting. Wonderful decor in the rooms. Work desk if required, so much space. Large windows with the most fantastic peaceful view.  Professional wonderful warm welcoming receptionist. Check in and checkout seamless.
Food and service in Sika restaurant second to none.
Made to feel so welcome. Can't wait for my next visit.",5,2019,11,26
217,Look no further,"Powerscourt is a stunning property located in one of Ireland’s most picturesque settings. We recently stayed on the ‘Grown Ups’ package and were blown away from start to finish by the genuine warmth and friendliness of the team. Ashford Castle has always been my favourite but I have to say the team at Powerscourt certainly gave them a run for their money. Our room was magnificent with stunning views, we were kindly upgraded which is always nice when they are in a position to do so. I have stayed in their classic rooms also which do not disappoint. The Spa treatment I had with Timea was exceptional, this lady seriously knows her stuff, very impressive. The Spa itself is stunning and beautiful to relax in. Dinner is Sika was beautiful and again very friendly genuine service throughout. I couldn’t recommend the hotel enough, the team should be very proud. Special mention to Clea at reception who was so lovely and again very genuine, the Concierge and Porter Robert and Mossy were great fun and had plenty of suggestions and post stay Joanna was really lovely to deal with. All in all it was perfection!",5,2019,11,22
217,Very enjoyable,"Stayed there last saturday night, hotel lobby was busy but Check-in was quick & efficient. The room was really nice & a big comfy bed. The bathroom is really big & with a tv in the mirror, so if you wanted to have a bath you could watch TV :-).
They supplied a nice travel cot for our son.
We had food in the hotel bar, steak sandwich followed by apple tart both were delicious.
Breakfast was a highlight, ok the fry was nothing special. but the little touches like warm scones & clotted cream and jam, was a nice touch & good selection of fresh fruit.",5,2019,11,22
217,Not five star in reality,"Have to say its not a five star hotel.  It looks the part, but the food, the service and even the room arent what you’d expect in a hotel with a five star rating.  We paid 340euros for a garden view King suite.  The  room was tastefully decorated, but the windows were so dirty couldn’t see the garden!  There is no kettle in the room but there is a nespresso machine.  The TV is fine but there are no film channels (unless you pay) and the cost of the items in the mini bar is astronomical.  There are no power sockets by the beds (why is that??) and one socket in a drawer in the desk – we couldn’t find others!  The water wasn’t very hot.  The toiletries in the bathroom are pretty mean too – all miniatures and one of each for two people!  I also don’t understand how hotels don’t have bath mats to ensure folk can get out of the bath safely.  The breakfast wasn’t great.  Ive never been at a five star hotel that provides a machine for you to make your own toast!  The potatoes were clearly frozen and the mushrooms seemed to be tinned.  No fried eggs left when we attended for breakfast.  In addition, they charge a supplement of 5euro each to have Eggs Florentine/Benedict, maple pancakes with bacon and one other dish.  The bar menu is very limited.  We had fish and chips.  The fish was tasteless.  The caesar salad was tasty.  Its clearly getting the visitors because it’s the only 5 star in the area, but its really not worth the money!",3,2019,11,21
217,"Location and décor wonderful, poor otherwise","Cold shower in the morning, bland food for lunch and dinner in the Sugar Loaf restaurant and confusion at Reception made the stay frustrating and not in keeping with 5 stars. It was very expensive and poor value for money.",2,2019,11,20
217,Relaxing pleasant stay,"Stayed two nights. Room very quiet, spacious, excellent breakfast and surroundings. Excellent staff attentiveness and attention. Pleasant and welcoming. Easy parking. convenient to Bray to get Dart into the city.",5,2019,11,20
217,As good as perfect,Stayed as part of a long weekend as part of early anniversary celebrations. All the staff that we came across made us feel very welcome and the facilities there are second to none! Can not wait to find another excuse to stay again! It was perfect!,5,2019,11,20
217,Great Stay,"I stayed here for a business meeting and had a fantastic stay.  The rooms are beautiful, the food is excellent, the staff are top class and the surroundings are stunning!! It truly is a top class hotel and I look forward to my next visit. I did not get to the spa this time but I did on my last trip and it’s a fantastic experience. 
",4,2019,11,19
217,Stunning Hotel. Beautiful surroundings.,"Myself and my fiance stayed here for one night (14/11/2019 Thursday) as it was her birthday on the friday and we were celebrating our 5 year anniversary too.
The hotel is simply stunning, staff are very nice. We were very impressed by our room which was a suite with great views of the mountains.
Can't really say a bad thing about our stay!
We had food in McGills bar which was very tasty too and reasonably priced! The service by the staff in McGills was top notch, the staff are a credit to the hotel.
We would recommend this place and hopefully we will be back in the future for another stay.",5,2019,11,17
217,Genuine 5 Star Experience,"We had a wonderful stay, probably the best holiday we've stayed in. Facilities and staff are exceptional. We had to check out quite early and were sent on our way with some complimentary coffee and pastries. Planning our next stay already.

Neil & Liz",5,2019,11,16
217,Amazing!,"Took my mum here for her birthday. Neither of us had been before. 
It was perfect from the minute we arrived- the staff are so friendly and helpful, the room was massive and very clean and quiet and the swimming pool was lovely and warm. We ate in the sugar loaf restaurant in the evening and the food was delicious and had a glass of wine in the lobby afterwards. I couldn’t recommend it enough- such a nice weekend!
Plan to visit again next year and maybe try out the spa too.",5,2019,11,16
217,Fawlty towers more so than five star,"My fiancée and myself booked to stay for two nights as a joint birthday trip for ourselves in this apparent 5 star hotel. Both of us were looking forward to this break.

We arrived in the hotel after a beautiful hike around the glendalough area, highly recommend the white trail.

We can to the hotel booked in and got showered and changed. The general cleanliness in the room, shower and bathroom were nothing short of disgusting and something you wouldn't even expect in a two star hotel. Grout was not only covered in orange body fat but also black mould, showing that this hadn't been cleaned properly for weeks. I spoke with reception and they offered to change us rooms and to get housekeeping to clean it. We decided to let housekeeping clean it whilst we went out for dinner. 

We then came back to the hotel and decided to go for a drink in the bar. My fiancée choose to have a cocktail that contained raspberry vodka. When ordering this we were told that there was no raspberry vodka in the whole hotel, which for a hotel of this size and stature seemed even more unbelievable. After looking over the menu again to see what to order I noticed a full bottle of raspberry vodka behind the bar in full display. I then brought the bar manager over and asked how can we be told there is no raspberry vodka when it was in clear view. He then had to go away for some 5 minutes to get cream for the cocktail. Not only was this insulting to be told something in not in stock and me as the customer has to show the bar manager that there is some behind the bar. I feel as if they just didn't want to make it as they would have had to go and get cream from somewhere. Showing complete incompetence.

On our return I checked the shower area again as it was clear that someone had been in the room however the dirt, bodyfat and black mould still there and was even more insulting that after a complaint and a five star hotel would deem acceptable. 
I had to go back to reception and bring the night manager up to the room after explaining the situation 
and showing him the disgusting 
facilities. I then showed him using a face cloth how this can be cleaned.

He agreed it was completely unacceptable and we had to move rooms at 11:30pm that evening.

Then after dinner the next day I paid for a bottle of wine by card and went back up to the room. Some five minutes later I received a call to say that they would need to take the payment again as it kept printing a receipt then had to avoid the transaction. I then went back down to the restaurant and paid it again and had to show the person taking the payment how to use the pdq machine as they were pressing the wrong button which was causing the problem. Again another fantastic showing of incompetence within the hotel.

When using the pool area the ceiling paint is visibly flaking off very badly over the pool area and looks extremely unsightly.

I would never recommend this hotel to anyone to stay in especially as you pay a substantial cost for a supposedly five star hotel but facilities and cleanliness completely disappointing and disgusting. I would recommend hotel invest time cleaning facilities correctly and invest time in training staff to bring up to standard expected in a five star facility",1,2019,11,16
217,Another fab stay at our favourite hotel ,My husband and I had the Grown up Getaway package and stayed for one night. A big thank you to Chris the Manager in the Sugar Loaf lounge for a lovely Lunch and wine and cocktail recommendations. Nothing was too much trouble for him and we really enjoyed our meal. I also had one of the nicest Aromatherapy Massages I’ve ever had with Bere at the Espa. Overall we had another lovely stay at Powerscourt and felt very relaxed leaving. ,5,2019,11,15
217,Not what it used to be,"After several previous visits we were really looking forward to spending another weekend in this stunning hotel. 
Unfortunately, the standards are not the same as used to be. 
The hotel swimming pool area doesn't feel like a spa anymore, but juts a regular hotel swimming pool (guess it's the new ceiling).

The dinner was good, but not exceptional, but what really left a bad impression was the breakfast. No salad or vegetable detected in the selection. One tiny bowl of pathetic looking fruit, cold scrambled eggs that kept the shape of the container after you take the cover off and lukewarm sausages with under-cooked bacon. WOW!  And every decent item such as omelette, eggs Benedict etc to be paid extra? Gone totally Ryanair style..
Paid  €680 for 1 night, dinner for 2 and a couple of pints with Fish & Chips from the bar and left a really bitter about that. Luckily it was a lovely sunny day and the beautiful gardens saved our day with a long walk.",3,2019,11,15
217,Just a little south of Dublin,Lies an idyllic place called powers court and Bonvoy has a beautiful haven there called the powers court hotel. Please look at the photos because the views and warm smiles of the people are the way you can capture the feeling of this wonderful place.,5,2019,11,12
217,Disappointing,"Was really looking forward to our stay in Powerscourt. But things definitely not all well there. Starting with long delays for drinks in the Lounge (20mins+) then the wrong drinks, then the bill had the wrong drinks charged twice.Also never experienced so many glasses been dropped by bar staff.

Dinner service in Sika was friendly but selections served to wrong people twice despite them asking which was which! Food was good quality but small portions. 

Breakfast had no special orders ie omelettes etc as the kitchen had no power following an “incident” we were told. Yet, “hot” food available at buffet which was luke warm. Plates in short supply and staff just not really caring. 

Dinner quality in The Sugar Loaf Lounge was of high quality. 

Overall the Hotel has excellent facilities let down by inexperienced sloppy staff which made the experience forgettable. 5 star hotels are defined by the superior customer service. We wont be back.",2,2019,11,10
217,Fabulous View,"Went with friends on a whim.

Very attentive staff and a quite stunning location as it’s outlook is the gorgeous Sugarloaf Mountain.

The hotel itself - not for me . Whilst it’s in a fabulous location it’s very expensive and I can admire the stunning high ceilings and to a certain extent the architecture ( if you like something that’s pretending to be Bath Royal Terrace or a Roman edifice) well there you are . I liked the huge reception but it’s oppressive with large amounts of dark wood pannelling.

So we had a light lunch overlooking the gardens & Mountain - loved it ( the view) and the light lunch was fine and we were well looked after by the staff.",4,2019,11,10
217,Most pretentious banal meal on the planet,"We dined in the Sika restaurant - no senior management supervision of staff - arrogant dismissive staff - bringing food late and repeatedly  to the wrong tables.  Chef an ardent fan of mousse and puree - with tasteless food behind this.  5 star prices for below par take away food.    Avoid at all costs.  Unfortunately, unable to give it zero stars on trip advisor.",1,2019,11,08
217,Very good ,"I have stayed at this hotel many times and it always been a amazing experience and this time no difference from entry to the hotel ,concierge are exceptional Roby ,David stellar job every time they just enjoy people and don’t fake it makes a huge difference industry best .
Eat in McGills a couple of times found food and service very strong Both managers where on over the few days and I found them both excellent and I observed great service and attention to details once again they like people and all the staff are very well trained and organised, I find in 5 star hotels that staff have to love the industry you can not fake it needs to to a career 
Ian ,Keith great job ,you can clearly see that this is your careers  and you have a great team under you .
If I was to be critical sugarloaf  staff sometimes let the to the hotel down, slow service and food menus need to be addressed overall this hotel is special location is special and hopefully new owners are special to 👌",5,2019,11,06
217,Post Marathon treat,Love this hotel.  Short getaway after running my first marathon.  The associates were fantastic and the location was breathtaking.  Sat down for early dinner in the lobby and lost track of time.  Great food with wonderful views.,5,2019,11,05
217,"Beautiful hotel, poor service","I stayed at the Powerscourt Hotel as part of a group of 9 in at the beginning of Nov-19. Our group have stayed in many five star hotels around Ireland over the years and found our stay at the Powerscourt Hotel to be very disappointing. Overall, I found the main areas of the hotel, the rooms and grounds to be beautiful however while the majority of the staff were incredibly friendly and polite, many were very inexperienced, and some very rude. 

Two of our four rooms were not available until after 5PM, with one room not having been fully cleaned (this room was removed from our bill).

We had two issues with our food during lunch at the Sugar Loaf Lounge. One was quickly rectified with a replacement meal however the other issue was rudely rebutted by a Manager. Another Manager quickly addressed this with us and provided complimentary drinks to our group. 

In addition, we were told that due to bookings for afternoon tea, they didn't have a table to seat us all and split us into two groups. The table next to where I sat, while set for afternoon tea, was free the entire time we had lunch. It was a shame the staff didn't remove the setting to allow us to sit together and simply advise us when they needed the table back.

We planned to eat at the bar that evening, so I popped down to the bar & spoke to the bar staff during the day advising them of our group size and we were told they don't accept reservations and that we would need to come down and wait for a table. We arrived at 7.30PM, where the Manager advised he doesn't have a table in the bar to accommodate our group, that there was no queuing system and that we would need to grab a table when one became available. Both the restaurant and lounge were fully booked and so we travelled into the nearby town on the complimentary shuttle bus for dinner. Other guests were in a similar position - it seems like the Powerscourt does not have enough tables to take all hotel guests.

In summary, our group was very disappointed with our stay at the Powerscourt Hotel and will not be returning.",3,2019,11,05
217,A little disappointing,"We had three rooms, six adults and five children.

1. Fire alarm on the first night. Off and on from around 9pm to just after 1am. Only impacted our room thankfully. No apology from the hotel; nor any offer of recompense. An expensive room to spend ""half the night"" wondering if the alarm would go off again.

2. Service in the foyer area was slow, in fact on two occasions our small top up orders went unfulfilled. In the end we just gave up. 

I thought, that for a five star hotel, the breakfast could be best described as ordinary. The coffee was especially disappointing. On the plus side both my daughters and their family had no complaints.",2,2019,11,04
217,Far from 5 star,"We visited for a special occasion and we left very disappointed.

Service was terrible, kids pretending to be waiting staff; cold food; warm wine; incorrect drinks served; no turn down service; ac not working in the room

Other than that it was fine!!!

There are so many wonderful luxury hotels in Ireland this one has no future if it doesn’t correct its ways soon

We will not be back",1,2019,11,03
217,Beautiful Hotel - But Lacking In Service ,"What a beautiful hotel situated in the Garden of Ireland.  
Check-in was quick.  Maybe a little two quick as they forgot to tell the house keeping who barged into our room about five minutes after we arrived apologising that they were never told him we had arrived.  
As I said, the hotel is stunning and the standard rooms are very large, with large bathroom (twin sink), and walk in closet with lots of wardrobe space.  
Mini bar, coffee machine, iron and hairdryer. 
But what you gained in a great hotel room and location, they lost in the service or should I say, lack of service.  
We went to the bar for a bite to eat.  
After being seated for a little while and no sign of any waiting staff,  I went to the bar and ordered a drink. 
I then had to go again to the bar to get a menu for food as they just didn't seem to be interested in the customers.  
I found myself up again for the third time, this time to ask a waiter to take our food order.  And again to get the bill.  And it wasn't just us, I was watching other guests walking to the bar looking for menus and service.  
The staff in the bar seemed very unhappy in their job.  
And then the food.  Mmm.  Fish and chips.  Watery fish which would indicate it was most likey cooked from frozen.  
Hard to believe considering we were only a couple of miles from the sea. 
Not great to be honest.  I have had better in fish n' chip shops.  
When we moved to the lobby, we were moving glasses and side plates away from where we wanted to sit as their was noone clearing up.   
The used glasses from other guests were left behind us, where we were sitting, for the entire time.  Not good. 
The walk on the grounds of the hotel is lovely and worth doing.  
But breakfast this morning was terrible.  
A full Irish breakfast was COLD.  Not cool - cold.  Cold sausages, cold bacon, cold tomatoes, cold fried eggs, cold mushrooms.  
I complained and was told that it was a problem from the kitchen. 'No kidding'.   But no offer of hot food!
So in conclusion, lovely hotel, lovely location but maybe eat elsewhere and don't get breakfast.  Dreadful. ",3,2019,11,02
217,Beautiful hotel but awful service,"The building is amazing and the rooms  are magnificent! The service, however, is extremely disappointing.
For a 5 start hotel, you would expect excellent service, we got nothing of the sort.
The ‘Traditional Irish Pub’ tucked as far away as possible in the basement near the underground car park was not an enjoyable experience. It took an hour and 20 minutes for a Caesar salad and a burger and we had to clear the glasses on our table from the previous customers ourselves. We went to the lounge for a drink after but after giving us menus no came back to take our order so we left. 
The post-check out service is non existent. We opted not to leave our card linked to the room so we could pay as you go during out stay only to find a mysterious debit the next day from the hotel. 3 emails (one to a manager) later to find out what the charge is and nothing back. 
What could have been so exceptional was beyond poor. We have had better nights away and far better service in modest b&bs around the country.",1,2019,11,02
217,Disappointing Stay,"Booked for our wedding anniversary and had arranged prior to my arrival for the hotel to have a bottle of prosecco and chocolates for my wife as a surprise, however, when we arrived there was nothing in our room.
I contacted reception about this and asked to see if we could get moved as my wife was disappointed with the room, it was dark and we were looking into an overgrown 'courtyard.' I was willing to pay for a nicer room and was told by reception that the hotel was full even though the carpark was empty!
This was my second and will be my last visit to the hotel, very disappointed and expect more from a 5* hotel.",1,2019,10,31
217,Sad to see it’s decline. ,"This was my fifth visit to the hotel and how things have changed. No concierge to check us in or take bags to room. No water or juice on arrival at reception. No newspaper to room. Couldn’t book sika restaurant as booked out. Worst of all was the breakfast. Food freezing. Limited choice and a very cheeky supplement of €5 for an egg choice. Are you actually joking ? It cost me €700 for a two night mid week stay in what’s supposed to be a 5 star hotel. The spa and pool is dated and in need of serious maintenance. Handles on doors broken, shower hoses removed so that there is only a spray in the sauna area. Really disappointed this time as this was our favourite hotel. Will definitely lose 5 star rating at this rate. 4 star at a push.",4,2019,10,31
217,Nice but a little underwhelmed,"We booked a table for four in the Sugarloaf  lounge for lunch. My first time in the hotel and loved the warm welcome from the smart concierge who came out with a large umbrella in the pouring rain. She gave us a great smile in spite of the cold and wet day. Inside too was warm with comfortable sofas to sit beside the fires either side of the entrance.
Our table was beside a window with a lovely view of the gardens and beyond.  The lunch menu was interesting in that it was not too large but a nice choice from soup to steak sandwich and wraps and salads and fish and chips. 
We all opted for the battered cod and chips  which came on large heavy  oval plates which would be a challenge to any server to carry. I was astonished to find two small pots , the sort jam comes in,one was Heinz tomato sauce and the other  mayonnaise. They would  be the sort of stuff you would expect in a take away place  but  for a 5 star hotel..  I would liked to have said that the food was delicious, sadly it was cold and the chips were really soft and bendy and unpleasant . When asked by the server was everything  alright  I had to tell her it was not very enjoyable.    Later she came and said tea/coffees would be on the house. We appreciated that.",4,2019,10,31
217,Not bad ,"Stayed there for one night with my wife. Hotel & grounds look amazing. Room size was excellent with everything you need in the room. Had the evening meal & the food was delicious. Breakfast was just so so. This is a hotel that needs to take its staff on a training course as many of them are inexperienced & as a result some of the services are poor. Ordered porridge arrived cold. Ordered tea, had to remind the staff 3 times to deliver it. Had to give our room number 3 times for the restaurant desk to understand it as the girl at the desk was in another world. The checkout was a disaster, took 25 minutes & the bill was incorrect 3 times where we were overcharged massively. Maybe with the return of the Celtic Tiger here in 2019 they can’t get the staff. Overall it was good to experience it but I won’t be staying there again. ",3,2019,10,30
217,Absolutley spectacular!,"Just home from an amazing 2 night stay at Powerscourt Hotel, we stayed here as a treat for our 1st wedding anniversary and were completely blown away the moment we came through the front doors! We chose to stay in a mountain view suite - which was absolutely huge! Far exceeded any hotel room we have ever stayed in before.  The room had everything that you could ever want! The bedroom led to a private balcony which had gorgeous views over the sugar loaf mountain and fountain/garden area.  We decided to dine in McGills pub on both nights and can highly recommend the Cajun Chicken burger and a Whiskey Sour to finish! On both nights there was a fantastic music which started from about 10.30pm to late.  Will definitely return to Powerscourt Hotel in the future.",5,2019,10,29
217,A taste or Ireland,"wanted somewhere special for a treat for my wife 
what a fantastic hotel and spa 
this place is beautiful and stylish ,great staff wonderful food 
we will definitely return in the summer 
booked a mountain view suite room 642 had sun all day long .  ",5,2019,10,27
217,Majestic mountain views,"Had the suite with semi private balcony overlooking sugarloaf. It was a beautiful view.
Room had walk in wardrobe, large partitioned bathroom with bath, shower, double sink and tv. There ware remote control curtains and the remote also controlled temperature, lights and do not disturb. Lots of space and nice balance between modern amenities and classic decor. 
Common areas are clean and have lovely features such as the hot air balloon chandeliers. 
Food in Sika was decent as was the room service breakfast. Substantial enough room service menu. 
Great location for shopping in Dublin, visiting Powerscourt house and gardens and the waterfall. Also about 30 mins from Sallygap.
Would be good hotel for those who like to hike. 
Overall most certainly worth 5 stars. ",5,2019,10,27
217,"Nice hotel, but a bit impersonal","Cons:
Total lack of personal touch. I don't like to be over annoyed by constant assistance but the how to guide on the TV, while helpful, isn't enough. No one wants to spend their whole stay trying to suss things out. We were told breakfast times, not where breakfast was, we were told where our room was but not that there were different lifts to get to the bar and restaurant, etc. I don't blame staff as they are obviously told to do a very express check-in but all the usual stuff was missing that you expect in any average hotel. None of the usual ""have you stayed here before?"", etc. This is fine if you are on a quick business trip and staying in an airport hotel, not something you would expect at a five star spa.

The famous gardens are not accessible. You can only enter parts of the gift shop and the very beginning of the garden (although if you have a powerchair you may be able to chance the steep slope). I know the hotel staff do not work here, but when a visibly disabled guest (using a rollator) asks for directions it might be worth a mention. Staff at the gardens also did not mention how bad it was on seeing me enter, and allowed us to pay in (full price, not asking for a discount but if I had known it wasn't accessible I could have decided if I wanted to go in). Not a word at all. I'm used to being told I can only enter certain parts of attractions, so it was a total surprise. There is door to skip over the first two steps which the woman did not show us, instead she said ""mind the step"" as we entered the main exit to the garden. Regardless even if she had any cop on as a normal human, this only benefits accessibility over a few steps. The gardens were pretty, but not worth the hassle or the pain or the panic at getting stuck and nearly having to ring someone for help. If we missed a more accessible route this was because nothing was sign posted with accessibility signs, like at most out door gardens/ woods/ venues. Needless to say I was in a lot of pain afterwards and would not have attempted the paths if I had known. We got completely stuck and had to rest, then continue to drag my body up the slope. It was hell, took ages as you can imagine. While I realize this is not directly part of the hotel, it would be nice for someone to mention it when I was talking to them about visiting and maybe something just to note as I’m sure staff get lots of enquiries.

Not a huge deal but on booking my husband told them the trip was to celebrate my 5 years cancer remission, I think he thought might get a free glass of wine with dinner or something as some hotels take note of special occasions, but it was never mentioned.

Pros:
The spa staff explained the layout there at least and I did find general hotel staff (the couple we had any contact with) friendly. Food and drink was nice in the hotel. I liked the general decor of the rooms and greater hotel. Plenty of space in the room, comfortable bed, very clean. Nice surroundings, plenty of parking too. Not overly busy hotel the night we were there which was nice, relaxing atmosphere all around. For these reasons I have still scored high. 

I would probably stay here again and plan different activities, although it wouldn’t be my first choice of spa as it’s just not my sort of place. But I would recommend the place to friends and family who I know wouldn’t mind the impersonal touch. ",4,2019,10,27
217,Chill out day with my daughters. Well worth it.,"We spent the day in the spa in the Powerscourt hotel. The overall impression is that the staff want this to be something special. While the lunch was dreary...the chicken sanwich was dull chicken breast, wrapped in a cold , tastless wrap. I could not finish mine. This could easuly be improved. However, the full body massage was excellent. The therapist, Rachel, knew exactly what she was doing and managed to remove all the knots and bundles of stress. The actual steam rooms/sauna/pool were ok and they need to have more towels, because ours got drenched. I put on a cold, wet dressing gown aftere my wonderful massage and had to head off to fins a fresh one. Everywhere I walked was very wet.",4,2019,10,21
217,A truly wonderful stay,"It was a lovely stay. The staff were excellent and very friendly. The facilities were truly 5 star.
The landscape was absolutely amazing.
However the towels and bathrobes were quite coarse as if they have been reused constantly

Overall I would highly recommend",5,2019,10,21
217,"A great place to stay, close to tourist activities ie Glendalough and the Wicklow Mountains","Check in was seamless with terrific assistance from the concierge in luggage and parking our car. The gentleman even ensured we booked dinner in time to watch the second half of the Tottenham Hotspurs game, which was a great compromise and ensured no arguments!!!!
The room was spotlessly clean with one of the the best bathrooms and lighting we found in our travels. Great for hair drying as the dryer is located in the bathroom and you dont need to fiddle about with mirrors etc in the bedrooms to dry your hair as is the case in most  other hotels.
We dined both nights in the Sugar Loaf Restaurant. The service was terrific and made even more enjoyable with the banter from James and the lovely service from Regina. Little treats were bought out to us between courses. 
Directions for attractions were provided and there is plenty to see within this area. 
All in all, we had a lovely time and even tho there were renovations happening, it didnt detract from our comfort or enjoyment. It is a great place to stay when heading back to Dublin airport. Very accessible and an easy 40 minute drive to the airport..",5,2019,10,20
217,So disappointed ,"As a Titanium Elite lifetime member I have stayed at a lot of Marriott properties throughout the world and have been accustomed to a certain level of service. I have also stayed at several of the Autograph Collection, and have always had an unique experience that Richard Kessler had in mind when he developed his indie brand of hotel. 
So when I booked my stay at Powerscourt using points and upgrade certificates I was extremely excited to experience this hotel. My excitement grew when I received an email stating I was upgraded to a family suite. 
Upon checking in the lady checking me in said you me since it’s only 2 of you we aren’t putting you in the family suite.  Shocked but I trusted I would still receive a suite that was comparable, especially since I was using upgrade certificates. 
But to my surprise she put me in the smallest room with zero view.  Even though I had also used points to ensure we had the Mountain View. And trust me the property was less than half full. 
I went back down and asked could we have the original room we were upgraded to and she said no.  I have no idea what the issue was!  She then put us in a room with a view of the mountains but as you can see the windows were so dirty. 
I know this use to be a Ritz property and was not successful and with the state of this property as well as the attitude of the staff I don’t see this property being successful long term. 
The only reason we stayed in this area was to experience this property.  So disappointed!   Two nights of our vacation we will not get back.  
In addition they are doing construction on the restaurant, which was right below us, and they start jackhammering early morning so needless to say you can not sleep in even. 

The pictures are the windows in our room, the dying flowers in the lobby and the main sink in the women’s restroom. 
",2,2019,10,19
217,Very underwhelming - Jan 2018,"A very delayed post...

Bedroom was faultless! Clean, very spacious and a very comfortable bed. We stayed in one of the Mountain View Suites and the it was just beautiful (Room 242)

We tried to eat in the sugarloaf lounge before check-in but unfortunately it was full. We went to the bar downstairs and had lunch instead, which was delicious. We ate in the restaurant that night, risotto starter wasn’t great and the chocolate sphere underwhelming, but the steaks were delicious. Breakfast was very poor for a 5* hotel. We were waiting quite a while to be seated. Food on offer was the same as your standard 3 or 4* hotel, not a prestigious 5* really nothing to be ‘wow’d’ by, although we had heard this before booking the hotel so weren’t totally shocked.

The pool area was a shambles, absolutely does not resemble the calm relaxing environment they have shown on their website. Whilst I appreciate its children friendly, the swimming pool was packed with kids running up and down the side of the pool, jumping and diving in and shouting around the place. Floor was soaking everywhere and slippery and towels thrown all over the ground and benches. We decided to give the pool a go and as we had just gotten in a kid did a run and jump into the pool right beside us. We decided to just call it a day and leave. As I was pregnant at the time, I couldn’t make use of the jacuzzi or sauna (neither had children in it though and they looked nice)

We did the express check out as they encourage you to do it. A few days later I saw they had debited by account by an additional €236.50. After contacting them and explaining they had charged me this, the front officer manager was adamant that it was for me and there would be no refund. She went on to send me the invoice which had somebody else’s details on it including their name, home address and room number. I explained over and over I wasn’t with this person and knew nothing about this person. She was rude and insinuated I was a liar. 11 days later I finally got the refund and she accepted it was an error on their side and offered her apologies.

Very disappointed with my stay, not sure I would spend all that money again to stay here.",2,2019,10,17
217,Perfection,"A group of 8 of us headed for a spa break to the hotel. 2 couples got upgraded to amazing suites, which was pretty unexpected as the hotel was fairly packed. Everything from the gorgeousness of the facilities, the professionalism of the staff and the deliciousness of the food and the cocktails was 5 star quality, not to mention the incredible surroundings. It is by far the best spa break I have had in Ireland, and I have had quite a few, in terms of value for money and I will certainly be returning soon enough",5,2019,10,14
217,Fabulous hotel,"Having had a wedding reception in Powerscourt House & Gardens, ourselves & our families stayed the wedding night here. The reservation team were so accommodating from the beginning, block booking rooms for our guests. The Mountain View suite was stunning & the breakfast was wonderful.",5,2019,10,07
217,Overnight Stay,Stayed in Powerscourt Hotel in late September on a Saturday night. Upon arrival we were immediately impressed with the grounds and the check in process was run very smoothly. Despite several people checking in at same time we were given a warm welcome and fully briefed on what the hotel had to offer. Our room overlooked the Sugarloaf and was the most spacious hotel room we ever stayed in. Great attention to detail in the room and the bathroom is really well designed. The tv screen witin the mirror deserves a special mention along with dual sinks and sizeable bath. Fully equipped gym on site and lovely lobby and lounge with great view as the backdrop.The surrounding grounds are ideal for walks and sight seeing. The only negative was that as it was my daughter's birthday I had preplanned that if hotel had left a happy birthday message in room that would have been a nice touch if possible. This never happened in the end. I would not let this put me off booking this hotel again and in fact we are planning another stay there soon! Highly recommended.,5,2019,10,06
217,Good-but not great,We stayed here 7 years ago and were excited to try it again. Our room was amazing and the view beautiful. The area is very pretty and the gardens and waterfall are close by. Thursday it was very windy and raining hard by the afternoon and there is very little to do in the area that is not outside. W th Ight we would hangout and read or watch a movie in our room- it wasn’t cleaned by 2:00. It wasn’t done until 4:30. We had tea time at the restaurant and it was not worth the price. To kill time as we waited for our room we went up to the pub-but it was closed for a private event. Check out in the morning took over 20 minutes as they only had one person checking people out. Over all it was apparent they didn’t have enough staff. The pub food was good and the staff friendly.,4,2019,10,05
217,Spa Birthday treat,"Just returned from a fabulous day at Powerscourt Spa with my daughter.  Everything was perfect, from our treatment of full body massage and facial to the the pool, sauna and serenity room. Can’t wait for a return visit. 😀",5,2019,10,05
217,Amazing stay and an excellent service!!,"We had an amazing stay at the hotel! The weather was terrible but because of all the comfort at the hotel we totally forgot the weather!

The pool and sauna facilities were excellent and compliments to the staff at the reception and at the Irish Bar!",5,2019,10,01
217,Fabulous,"I've just come back from a wonderful overnight stay at this fabulous hotel. From the moment of check in, you're taken care of. The receptionist, Katy, really made my trip by upgrading our room and noting that it was a birthday celebration - every effort was made to make the occasion special, with chocolates left in our room and the memo even made it to the sika restaurant that evening with a surprise extra desert after a delicious three course dinner . 
The spa was fantastic, with a private area for guests who were having treatments and the option of the spa lunch was good, with a choice of 3 mains, with a salad, soup and desert. 
All the staff were very accommodating and friendly and nothing was too much trouble. I'd highly recommend a stay at this hotel.",5,2019,09,30
217,Excellent hotel in a nice area,"Although I was on a business trip, I could enjoy the hotel.
The rooms are very good and spacious, and the common areas are also quite good.
If you have the opportunity stroll by the gardens and near by woods.",5,2019,09,29
217,Disappointing,"I decided to bring my wife for a birthday lunch to the ""five star"" powerscourt hotel. We ate our lunch in the bar area, which is a long way off five star. The bar had very poor lighting and was cold. There was an adjoining smoking area that had heat lamps hanging off and was covered in leaves. 
The server was very pleasant but had limited knowledge of the menu, which you would not expect. The food was at most average and most definitely not worth what they charged. ",3,2019,09,29
217,A lovely place to stay,Lovely time in Powerscourt. A bottle of bubbly and chocolates dropped up for my sister's birthday which I thought was a lovely treat. Check in is way too late. 4pm and the pool closes at 6pm which was the only reason we went. The Jacuzzi then was packed but lucky we got in. Restaurant food was good but not 5 star. Very over priced compared to other 5 star property's I have been to. The hotel itself is so beautiful and the room was fab.,4,2019,09,29
217,Outstanding,"Loved, loved, loved our stay here. As a Marriott Titanium member, I received a terrific upgrade to a huge suite that included a dressing area, large bathroom, living room and bedroom. The public spaces in this hotel are gorgeous with great views. The concierge was extremely helpful with ideas on how to spend our day and in making dinner reservations. We loved being walking distance to the estate, gardens, golf course, and distillery. I would definitely stay here again - it was a memorable experience and we loved every minute of our stay.",5,2019,09,28
217,Great Hotel,"About a 30 minute drive from downtown Dublin but worth it.  Beautiful property extremely well maintained and staff that will go above and beyond to make guests happy.  The sugar loaf lounge on the main floor is great for drinks, lunch, or dinner.  McGills pub has great food as well.",5,2019,09,28
217,Hotel looks stunning but don’t let quality standards slip on the room cleanliness and customer service.,"Overall this hotel is stunning. Set in wonderful grounds with beautiful scenery.  The overall facilities are fantastic however my room experience was poor hence the lower rating. I was there for two nights this week for a conference.  I was looking forward to a room with a view of the scenery.  First dissapointment. Basic room with no view.  I asked reception if I could change to be told a definitive NO even though I understand the hotel was not at capacity. Second and more concerning issue upon getting into the bed I noticed thick dust on the headboard by the pillow. Indicating this hasn’t been cleaned in some time. I called reception and we arranged to have it cleaned in the morning which they did. I had a twin room and both headboards had the same issue plus thick dust on the bedside lamp. When I had a bath the water leaked on the floor from the taps too. I got the feeling it was a room that probably wasn’t used very often.  Overall when I told reception they didn’t seem interested.  Cleanliness should be a number one priority was dissapointing again.  Upon checking out nobody asked me about my stay. Reinforced my perception that they didn’t care.   For such a lovely venue I would encourage the hotel to ensure these very basic points of service, cleanliness and ensuring a positive customer experience are given consideration.",3,2019,09,27
217,5 Star Experience!,"Firstly this is a 5 star hotel so expect to pay a bit extra for food and drink. The bar food is top class and reasonably priced.
 This is definitely the best hotel I have stayed in Ireland. Service, room size, staff and food were all top class. We stayed with a 1yr old baby and the staff couldn't do enough for us. They were genuinely lovely. The hotel itself is very luxurious and we could have spent the 3 days in the hotel and the grounds. Theres lots to do in the surrounding areas.  We had dinner from room service one of the evenings and it was like eating in a top restaurant. Really enjoyed our stay and would definitely recommend this hotel. Keep an eye out for good mid week offers. ",5,2019,09,26
217,I Loved It! Highly Recommend!,"This is an exquisite hotel where you are treated like Royalty!  We received an upgraded room which was as large as an efficiency apartment!  The views and trails on the grounds are captivating!  The staff are friendly and kind.  The food is excellent!  The spa and indoor pool are so clean, relaxing and just wonderful!  The Powerscourt golf course is on the grounds, although not affiliated with the hotel. The concierge can easily book you a tee time if you desire to play. We so enjoyed our stay we will definitely return should our next travel plans take us to Ireland.",5,2019,09,25
217,Let down by poor service & lack of attention to detail,"The hotel is grand and beautiful. It really is a magnificent property set in beautiful grounds. Unfortunately things went downhill rapidly from there.

We have a high status level with Marriott Bonvoy and had requested and early check in, specifically noting we would arrive around 12:00pm (we actually arrived around 1:30pm). On arrival we were told our room wasn't ready (a suite with mountain views) and that normal check in wasn't until 4pm. We inquired as to when the room might be ready we were simply told that he didn't know and reiterated check in wasn't until 4pm. There was no acknowledgement of our request or my partners status with Marriott, and no guidance on when we could get a room. We ended up having to request to the Front Office Manager, downgraded our room to a garden suite and then checked in.

The room was amazing - simply huge, nicely decorated and well appointed. It was also really clean and well maintained. We really loved it and it was nice to have terrace access from our room. The downside was the air conditioning didn't appear to be operable from our controllers (it kept coming on randomly to blow hot air even when we had shut it down). This was clearly an issue in other rooms as most guests appeared to have their windows open at night and when an engineer finally came to our room to solve the issue, he couldn't and they tried to shut down the system centrally (or so we were told).

It appears that management simply don't walk the floors. While the things I will mention are all minor and trivial in and of themselves, they build to give an impression of laziness or not caring, and in such a beautiful property it is frustrating to see. Many of the hallway lights on our floor (3rd floor) had the crystal bead strands unattached and the light fittings hanging crookedly. I tidied this up and straightened the lights, a 2 minute job, that housekeeping or someone should be on top of. In the dining room the curtains separating the breakfast area from the Sika restaurant had unhooked portions of curtain as well as a large section where the hem had dropped. The mirror had smudges on it, which admittedly someone cleaned after they had seen me notice it, the main painting in the bar area was hanging crookedly... the list goes on. Breakfast was not a particularly pleasant experience. We walked in to a scene of at least 8 uncleared dirty tables. I know the hotel was full but we have been in bigger and busier hotels where this simply isn't the case.

Dinner in Sika was pleasant and the prices were super reasonable so that was pleasant.  And the grounds were beautiful to walk through. Some of the staff were also very helpful (the doorman) and friendly. However all in all we left really disappointed in our experience here.

Management should go and stay at the Europe Hotel and Resort in Killarney in how to run a high end property properly, even with a full house.",2,2019,09,25
217,Stayed at the resort just recently for 2 days,Absolutely stunning. Beautiful hotel.  Only concern was at checkout when they were very understaffed.  Poor girl at the desk was a trainee and had difficulty keeping up.  Made our return to airport stressful.  Otherwise no complaints,5,2019,09,23
217,Best luxury weekend break close to Dublin,"We have been here many times, it never disappoints. The food in the Sika restaurant is divine and the food in the bar downstairs is excellent too. The bar downstairs usually has live music. The pool is luxurious and the gym is really great and spacious. The rooms are luxurious as are the bathrooms. If you book a room with the balcony it’s a real treat to walk out there and take in the scenery when you wake up. ",5,2019,09,22
217,"Nice looking place, but so many spiders in my bed, I had to leave early","Well, this is hard. I liked this place at first, but there were some issues. First, we traveled as a block of 30, and some of us kept finding ""giant house spiders"" in our rooms. I had one scurry over my bed at 7am as I woke up. I'm from California, so I don't have a fear of spiders, per se, but for 250 a night, one of the amenities should be ""no spiders in my bed or on my face."" 

Yes--one of our guests woke up with one such spider literally on her face. 

To be clear, these aren't dangerous spiders; their bites do contain venom, but like most spiders, they are very hesitant to bite. They're large and fast, and honestly, that's a better description for a beagle or corgi than it is an arachnid when booking a hotel. I found three in my room--one as I mentioned in my bed, the second on the floor by the windows (no screens, ground level, lots of cobwebs all over the outside) and a third in the shower. Photo included. 

But, I've stayed in 40/night motel 6's and holiday Inns in which I've never had to check my surroundings for extra legs. I'm comfortable with 2-6 legs in a bed, but 10 is just too many.  

One of the promotional items in the room states: ""If you're not completely happy, then please let us know straight away so that we can take the opportunity to fix any issues prior to saying goodbye. Heading home with something on your mind and telling us later is difficult for all of us. We have a team here to help."" (photo)

Well, I did, and the response I got was disbelief, until I showed them a picture, One employee admitted to ""hoovering"" up such spiders, and the on duty manager's remedy was to pass it off to the next manager, and then ultimately offer me a 10% discount. The manager then was ""unavailable"" with a promise to call to the room when he was back, and then there was no call. Again, I'm not picky, but for the price, it should command a little care and kept promises of calling me back when a manager is available. 

I say this in good faith, that I am not overly freaked out by nature, but was freaked out by their response, the price they command, and the overall reputation they bank on. 

Overall, it IS a fantastic looking place. I'm sure I'm an outlier; perhaps I was just here in a warmer week, and nature will be nature. But ultimately, I cancelled the last two nights here and made a booking at half the price actually inside of Dublin, and would not recommend this place unless you have money to burn (no judgement) and are interested in fighting spiders in the bathtub and watching where you walk. 

Overall: 2 stars, look for somewhere else depending on how you feel about inflexible remedies and, well, spiders. I didn't give it one star, because the gardens are nice, and I ended up doing extensive online spider research, on adrenaline, at 7 am. Perhaps recommendable to those interested in entomology.

Oh, and no hair dryer in the room. Did have an iron.",2,2019,09,22
217,Amazing stay!!!,"What a beautiful hotel.  The food was amazing.  The grounds were gorgeous.  The spa is excellent.  Service was fantastic. The rooms were large, and the bed was perfect. This is definitely a place to visit for some reat and relaxation.",5,2019,09,21
217,Not worth the money,"Georgeous looking hotel and the room was comfortable and clean.The bar is small and uncomfortable but the spa looked very inviting. The breakfast ,however, was shockingly over priced and badly cooked. The eggs Benedict was cold, the bacon was place and undercooked and the whole thing was badly presented . I wouldn't go back to this hotel tbh - I've paid less and stayed in better. I felt it was trading on its name but I certainly wouldn't recommend. 5/10",3,2019,09,15
217,Restful and beautiful accommodations ,"We stopped here for a night before heading on tours throughout Ireland. Spa is beautiful, fitness center has everything you need. The pool is a must see, spectacular. The rooms very elegant and beds comfortable. The morning breakfast buffet is large and plentiful. Enjoyed this quick stay, and plan to stay longer next time. A 30 minute drive to Dublin. This is a must stay destination ",5,2019,09,15
217,"Awful arrival, awful stay - thankful to leave!","Our arrival was marred by multiple buses lined up blocking the front entrance. Numerous guests swigging from bottles in vest t-shirts and a complete lack of any staff to offer assistance with luggage. 
After managing to find a spot to park between the parking lot of buses we waited, waited and waited for help with our luggage - none came! After entering the hotel in the hope to find someone to help, we searched around the gaggle of loud and obnoxious guests swarming the foyer, to eventually find someone to assist -
Which we had to ask several times, rather than simply being offered (as is the norm in a hotel). 
Eventually we checked in, no apology for the painfully awkward arrival -
Simply a comment - “we have many bus guests here staying at the hotel”; not an explanation but a further statement downplaying our welcome as mere hotel guests. 
Our room was shabby with peeling wallpaper, a bathroom is a tiny amenities limited to one set. The mattresses were lumpy and bedding stale. 
Our dining experience was equally as lacklustre. With food over cooked and cold we would have been better off not visiting the restaurant at all. The experience was equally as bad at breakfast with a distinct lack of service with plates piled up due to inattentive staff. 
The best part of our stay was the departure with a sigh of relief as we left the gates. 
I cannot recommend this hotel -
It is akin to a pleasant service station with a travel lodge attached. 
Our after stay experience was followed up by a polite email asking why our experience was bad, we replied but several but have heard nothing back. Again, bad service. Bad hotel.  Do not stay if you appreciate fine hotels - this is not one of them. ",2,2019,09,14
217,Beautiful Property and Grounds,"My wife and I recently spent one night at the Powerscourt.  It is a beautiful property with expansion landscape and grounds.

The staff was great and provided alot of good information on the local area and options for dining and activities outside of the hotel.

Based on our Titanium status with Marriott, we were upgraded to one of  the Powerscourt Suites.  It was a beautiful room and very spacious.  Everything was update to and in excellent condition.

We did take advantage of one of the mutliple restaurants on property.  We had dinner in the McGills Pub.  It has great atmosphere and a pretty good menu for a drinking hole.  :)

If you are into exercising, running, etc, the grounds are expansive and have plenty of safe areas for walking and running.  Designated sidewalks and paths for use across the grounds.

While we did not have time to explore, we did see that there was distillery and the original Powerscourt hotel on the grounds that you can tour.  They both look like they would be great to take in.

Highly recommend this property for a quick overnight or multi day stay.  We will definitely be back on our next visit to Ireland.",5,2019,09,13
217,Love Powerscourt,"Powerscourt is my go to place with it’s comfortable, quiet rooms and gorgeous setting. We were treated to an upgrade which was a lovely gesture. This was my first time dining in Sika restaurant and I was pleasantly surprised. The pool area is fabulous for relaxing. Seating in the jacuzzi isn’t the most comfortable but overall the spa area is lovely. Will definitely return. ",4,2019,09,11
217,"High on show, shallow on substance","Being less than one hours drive from Dublin Port, we chose to spend the final two nights of our short tour of Irish landmarks at Powerscourt Hotel. Our circular tour took us from from  Dublin to Carlingford Lough, Bushmills (& The Giants Causeway), and  a superb weekend at Kilronan Castle, boutique hotels with character and caring staff
You might say,  from small and intimate to Big and corporate. From genuine Irish hospitality to insincere, spasmodic and under par service. The change was palpable and proved to be highly unpalatable, in more ways than one.
Our snack lunch on arrival was good, albeit interrupted by staff constantly asking if all was well, yet not waiting on a reply!  Dinner in Sika that night was mediocre, again, staff constantly pestering to see if all was ok. Coffee was served prior to dessert, the petit-fours AFTER the dessert. This really sums up the chaos and poorly trained staff
Breakfast  was awful. After ten minutes we had to re-request coffee and toast. Soft boiled eggs were eventually served ROCK HARD - Coffee was luke warm.
Powers court Gardens (admission charge) are awesome and well worth a visit. They are within walking distance of the hot and we spent all our second morning there
Returning to the hotel my partner felt peckish and ordered a turkey wrap. Sadly for her,  she ate it, gladly, I didn't share it
That evening she had stomach cramps and was unable to eat or drink anything other than water at dinner in 'Sika' Restaurant. Various staff did ask if everything was ok? Not one expressed concern for her well-being, merely cleared  the uneaten food from the table without comment
That night my partner was violently ill. The night porter was very kind and brought several bottles of water
Next morning we checked-out shortly after 6am. Was everything ok? asked the receptionist. My partner explained how she'd been up all night sick . He made NO reply, although fair to say, night porter came over to ask how she was feeling.

After five days she has now received a response from the Head of Operations. It is abundantly clear from this response that Powerscourt management has  little or no consideration for the welfare of their clientelle and that IMAGE is far more important than substance. 
Had they shown the lest bit of concern or remorse over this most unappetising incident, we may have considered taking up their offer of an upgrade on a future visit rather than be penning a damning review",2,2019,09,10
217,Couples visit,We enjoyed a lovely stay. The hotel is immense. We enjoyed dinner and breakfast. We had a few pints in the bar whilst watching some rugby. We would recommend the hotel for a couples stay but it is expensive.,4,2019,09,09
217,Sugar Loaf Lounge Great Experience,"Really enjoyed the experience, looked after by Kate, she was very attentive and professional. We had afternoon tea & the views of the mountains were unbelievable. Great selection available on the menus and got a great table by the window, would recommend asking if there is availability.",5,2019,09,05
217,Utterly disappointing ,"Access to the thermal suite isn’t automatic, you either need to pay €50pp or book a treatment in the spa. Room service required payment on delivery(full balance had been paid via visa debit on check in), and my husband found a hair in his duck during his birthday meal.
Breakfast is basic with really limited table service. A Knock came to the door at 12:03 to ensure we were checking out...
Really really not 5 star service. 
The hotel itself is beautiful as are the grounds, but quite frankly, that’s it. So so disappointing. ",1,2019,09,04
217,Lovely country estate,"I love Marriott Bonvoy and was fortunate enough to stay at this Autograph collection hotel. It is a bit out in the country which adds charm to this resort. Our room was well appointed and were lucky to score an upgrade.  
There are gardens (rated #3 in the world by National Geographic)  that are next to the property and a distillery - both interesting ways to spend a few hours.  The hotel was quite full due to a wedding on the property (beautiful location ).   
Looking forward to a trip back ",5,2019,09,01
217,Good - but lacking in certain areas ,"I have just returned from a 5 night stay in Powerscourt with my wife and 20 month old son. Over all we had a great stay, but a couple of issues may have tainted us ever booking in again. 

We booked a mountain view suite. On first view it looked great. However upon lying on the bed, my back immediately sunk into the bed. The centre of the bed was good, along the spine, whilst the far side was not as weak as the opposite side. That night, such was the poor state of the bed my wife (who barely slept) almost took to the floor to sleep, until we swapped sides. I made the hotel aware of the issue following breakfast - including my wife’s experience the night before. 

Returning to the room later that morning following confirmation the issue was dealt with, it transpired all that had been done, was the mattress was flipped! Another visit to reception resulted, following which a new mattress was provided later that day.

No note of apology was received, and I was disappointed checking out yesterday that the hotel did not offer to cover the cost (partially of in full) of the first night; or to even offer a meal or bottle of wine, in recognition of my wife laying awake for much of the first night. 

The whole reason for our stay was to rest up... something the hotel failed to provide that night. 

Other observations:

There is also only one realistic option to eat for young families mid-week. McGills pub. 

Whilst ok, it’s not a nice environment for a young family. The main resultant does welcome kids up to 8pm, but the menu does not reflect the fact parents feeding young children have different meal time requirements to those seeking a more intimate culinary experience!

On the first night the room was stocked with one small shampoo bottle, and one shower gel... for two adults and a toddler. 

The tap in the bath dripped throughout our stay. 

Other than this, the staff were all excellent, the views and grounds stunning, the room otherwise clean and well proportioned, food in the lobby bar was decent. Overall, the first night aside, we did enjoy our stay.

Breakfast is ok, but not as memorable or extensive as other 5 star hotels.

Pool, gym, spa all good standard.

The hotel will need to be careful it doesn’t become another ‘5 star’, which is actually a 4 star +.

That brings me back to the bed and lack of recognition from the hotel. 

How that bed ended up in that room will remain a mystery to us! It was well past it’s sell by date. 

And it’s a real shame this was not appropriately recognised by the hotel - except by one hotel employee not in a managerial role who acknowledged it was in a very poor state.

For these reasons, Powerscourt was a good break for us (for four of the five nights!), but we may be slow to return. 

",3,2019,08,31
217,A Fantastic Hotel in Every Way,"The location is unbelievable.  Great views out to the mountain.  A short walk to Powerscourt Gardens, which you have to visit.  And a handy place from which to explore Wicklow, Military Road, Sally Gap, and more.
The hotel itself is gorgeous.  Our room was huge, in outstanding shape, and the bathroom was spectacular.  Service was top notch.
Separately I have reviewed Sika, the main dining room, where we had terrific dinners and even better breakfasts.
Make this your base for exploring the area or even Dublin, which is quite near.",5,2019,08,30
217,Experience of a lifetime,"From the second you arrive to the moment you leave, it is a soothe for your senses.
We stayed one night and arrived stressed and bad tempered. We left refreshed, smiling, and happy. This was our 3rd time at the hotel and the joy is consistent.",5,2019,08,30
217,"Amazing location, facility and staff!","We stayed for 3 nights.  The people were attentive, friendly and awesome.  The facility and views are breathtaking.  The breakfast was the perfect way to start our day.  Many activities within walking distance: golf, distillery, gardens, river walk etc.  Very peaceful and quiet.  

We took the free shuttle twice into Enniskerry to eat at the Enniskerry Inn...very good and great value.

Taxi to Bray was an easy way to grab the train into Dublin.  Bray is a beautiful seaside town.

We also took a taxi to the Powerscourt Waterfall...so very pretty.

Highly recommend Powerscourt Hotel.",5,2019,08,29
217,No 5* hospitality here,"No 5* welcome or renowned irish hospitality to be found here. Checkin staff member was robotic and unfriendly. Poolside staff member obviously hated his job and dealt with kids hour with utter destain. SO disappointing. Food at Pub was not up to scratch. Definitely on the demise since previous visits.  Will reconsider if ever returning. Need to get their act together and strive for true 5* rating. The beautiful location and decor is the best thing about this hotel - certain staff, food and overall service is totally lacking. ",2,2019,08,25
217,Absolutely deserving of its 5 star status,"My partner and I have just returned for a one night stay in Powerscourt and it is definitely one of the best experiences we have ever had in a hotel. We were celebrating my partners birthday and the staff in the hotel could not have done more to help with the celebration. We were lucky enough to get a complimentary upgrade to a beautiful suite, we also received complimentary glasses of Prosecco in the sugar loaf lounge and my partner received a lovely “happy birthday” dessert plate in the restaurant that night. Speaking on the restaurant, we are in Sika restaurant, the meal was delicious, I would highly recommend the beef. Breakfast was also amazing, with a great selection. The pool area is beautiful, we particularly enjoyed a lovely snooze in the loungers by the pool! All of the staff that we came across were extremely polite and helpful. We have to give a special mention to Silvana, who greeted us at reception and could not do enough for us throughout our stay. We are already looking forward to our next trip!",5,2019,08,25
217,On the decline,"Yeah, new management and all. But still: prices are the same, even more expensive with the new VAT. so the suite wasn't clean, cobwebs here and there, dirty windows, holes in the wall, the underground garage looks like a Flea Market, tired carpets, too many things that just don't look like a 5* Hotel. 

Then they inform you that breakfast will be busy, so come before 9:30...I don't pay for that crappy service. either open up more rooms for breakfast, so more people can fit in or provide complimentary breakfast in the room. 

Marriott Reward points are not rewarded if you book through a 3rd party website. yeah, but they still take 85-90% of my money, so how about rewarding me at least 85-90% of my points? Why give room contingency to 3rd parties anyways, if you won't reward your customers? Heck, they offer a better deal, so what's the logic of your policy?

time for a change, will try another hotel next time.",3,2019,08,24
217,Beautiful place with great walks,"Great hotel. Worth a visit and make sure to bring you hiking boots. Wonderful walks in throughout the estate. 

Rooms are exceptional, with a mass of space and wonderful views of the mountains. 

The only downfall of the hotel is the food. Not quite up to the standard you would expect. Don’t let this detract you from a visit however. ",5,2019,08,23
217,Amazing overnight stay ,Had a truly luxurious overnight stay . Room fabulous. Very luxurious. Spa top quality highly recommend a massage from Renata or Tatiana . Food in restaurant and lunch in spa both excellent. Had a lovely walk down to the village . Helpful staff too . ,5,2019,08,21
217,Great Stay,"We just left Powerscourt yesterday after a great 5 night stay.  We were upgraded to a lovely suite and really enjoyed that space.  My husband played golf and said the courses were great, and my friends and I enjoyed the beautiful gardens of the Estate.  The property is just stunning.  A special shout out to a few of the staff who really delivered above and beyond: Mark and Simon in McGill's who provided us great service every night, and Stephen at the front desk who helped us get through our luggage not arriving until two days after we did.  ",5,2019,08,19
217,Nice hotel but a few things let it down,"Hotel rooms are beautiful,  we stayed in a suite and it was very spacious and well presented. Bed was comfortable and we slept well. Throughout the room are panels controlling all lights and air con. Our air con didn’t work and we found the settings confusing with the lights. There was no hair dryer in our room either. the room has no sound proofing whatsoever and we could hear kids crying to 10.30pm at night.
We ate in the bar the first night and food was fine but very expensive for what you get. Basic burger and chips is 20 euro. 
We were on a couples break for my birthday. We have two small kids so it is nice to have a relaxing time away. I would not visit this hotel unless I had my kids with me in future. The hotel is over run with kids and families, which is fine but I feel the hotel should make an adult only bar perhaps? It’s great the hotel caters for families but I feel it needs to cater for adults only too in order to maintain a 5 star reputation. 
There were children crying at 9.30pm in the fancy restaurant in the hotel. 
I had a spa treatment which was the inner calm massage. The massage started off well but overall it wasn’t a great massage. No pressure, even though I asked for more. Again while I had my 150 euro treatment I could hear screaming kids in the hall - not relaxing!
We ordered room service which came and my chicken burger was raw in the middle. We called room service and they kindly didn’t charge for our lunch and gave us Prosecco as a sorry.
Overall, the hotel has massive potential, the gardens are lovely. The rooms are stunning but need improvement with sound proofing. This is not a couples holiday to me, this is a family hotel. That is fine but it needs to cater more for adults wanting to relax. Currently writing this review while listening to screaming children scrapping a chair along the floor in the next room at 10.30pm!",3,2019,08,18
217,Exceeded Expectations,"Everything about our 2-night stay was absolutely wonderful. Our room was spacious, beautiful, and the bed was blissfully comfortable. The grounds were truly a dream. Paul checked us in, Cathal brought our luggage to our room and both were genuinely friendly, helpful, and professional...and continued to be throughout our stay in every interaction. Lezette helped us during our check-out and ended our stay on an equally pleasant note. We wish we planned more nights at this property. It has been the highlight of our trip. We truly couldn’t recommend this gem of a resort more.",5,2019,08,16
217,Beautiful hotel with average food and service,"Let me start by stating the obvious - the hotel and gardens are just beautiful (something out of a book). My only complain is that the food is way to simple for such a majestic place...and in my particular stay, we had an issue with the AC not working and had to wait for a long time before someone actually gave up and we had to move rooms at 9:00 pm (when you're traveling with a 2-year-old, this is not so easy). Other than that, this place is worth visiting. ",4,2019,08,15
217,Finest Hotel,"We cannot rave enough about this hotel-
Is it a charming hotel in the Country or is it an elegant hotel with every amenity one could wish for-I would heartily say it both!
From our suite on the 2nd floor, I sat on our private patio watching an employee tend to the vegetable garden and I do believe I was eating from the garden at dinner at SIKA. 

The hotel is grand yet it seems like “home”. 
Before our arrival I had extensive communication with Mr Robert Smyth-and I mean EXTENSIVE. 
Mr Smyth is the Guest Relations Manager and he continually answered my email requests even on his days off!
I am sure his “hand” has a lot to do with how fine this property looks and the staff performs. 

The rooms are lovely, the gardens are a worthwhile destination, the nearby town is also charming...I could go on and on. 

I would recommend this hotel without reservations.  

We haven’t been to Dublin yet, but, after seeing photos on TripAdvisor-I would say the High Tea here surpasses what I saw online in Dublin’s finest hotels. 

Thank you to the Concierge who herself drove us into town today. 

We are so happy we chose to stop here before finishing our week in Dublin. It’s a 30 minute drive from the airport-and well worth the trip!",5,2019,08,14
217,Could have been 5 stars...,"Went to Powerscourt for a friends wedding.
The area is one of outstanding beauty and would have liked a few more days to explore. Rooms are huge and clean, although I think ours was perhaps not upgraded to the more modern ones our friends had.(we had one switch at the bedside for lights which did not work to switch off the desk and chair side light)- I had to unplug it...friends reported 6 switches at bedside!?
Went to the sugar loaf lounge for a snack as we arrived late. It was about 5:00 pm and we only wanted a club sandwich. Waitress informed us we couldn’t get it as they were setting up for dinner. As a five star hotel, this perplexed us as I am sure if we ordered room service it would have been made? Didn’t quite go above and beyond service- wise but a lot of the other staff were very friendly.
The wait to be seated at Sika( another restaurant on site) could also have been run a bit more efficiently- at breakfast there were long waits though admittedly it was quite busy.
Still a lovely hotel.",4,2019,08,14
217,Top Quality ,"Went here for a one night break recently.  Check in was hassle free, we had a beautiful room on the 6th floor. The room was beautifully decorated and has all the modern conveniences.  We had dinner in Sika restaurant and it is what you’d expect from a 5 star hotel... top quality! The service was also prompt and friendly.  Breakfast next morning was also great with a choice of egg cooked fresh and a good selection of hot/cold breakfast items.  This is a lovey hotel for a relaxing break.  
",5,2019,08,13
217,Buckley family visit,We stay at Powerscourt approx 4 times per year and have never been dissapointed. Its facilities are fantatsic. Gym top class and a wonderful spa area. Staff excellent with lovely spacious rooms. Food always good and location beautiful,5,2019,08,12
217,Girls day,Just out of a 50 minute treatment with Tatiana in the spa. It was hands down the best treatment I have ever had. Tatiana was fantastic and went through everything with me regarding skincare (without being pushy). Thank you so much for a lovely day. Myself and my mam will be back.,5,2019,08,12
217,"Slightly disappointed, not the 5 star level expected","Stayed here for 1 night on a busy Saturday. Checkin was very late which was fine as we were heading to the spa but I had requested 2 double beds and when we got to room about 6pm there was only a king bed. The tone of the receptionist was pretty off putting suggesting they could not see that request even though I told her I was looking at it in the confirmation mail I had received on booking. In hindsight I or they should have confirmed room type when we originally checked in at 1 could have meant we could have changed the room we were allocated.  Nothing could be done at 6pm. 

Breakfast was extremely disappointing, again very busy service. When seated we were not offered the breakfast menu as the two tables either side of us were. I had requested poached eggs when ordering coffee, they never arrived. The staff seem very focused on pleasing American guests genuinely felt invisible. No apologies for the misplaced order either which I cancelled when I finally got a waiters attention. The waiter was flustered dealing with the many many requests from an adjacent table and have a weak apology. 

Spa was amazing and a highlight. 

Overall though not the 5 star service I was expecting for the price quality was not there and I am unlikely to return.

",3,2019,08,11
217,Lovely Hotel ,"Fabulous hotel. We thoroughly enjoyed a short break with our three children. 
Beautiful, spacious family room. Swimming pool lovely 
Food was delicious in Mc gills. Best chicken wings ever! 
We had a small issue with lunch on arrival but staff were so professional and helpful with resolving the issue. Special mention to Keith and Lezette who went above and beyond to make our stay enjoyable. 
We would definitely return! A luxurious retreat for sure ",5,2019,08,09
217,Out of this world!!,"Just back from our very first stay here and will definitely be back again. I booked this back in January for myself and my partner for his birthday, plus we hadn't been away anywhere in the last couple years so I thought if we're going to treat ourselves, we're going to do it in style! 
This place made us feel like we were in a different country. Who knew that a place so exquisite could be on our doorstep!
Our room was amazing, decor to die for! Food and drinks were fabulous. We honestly just could not fault this place. The staff were so helpful too.
Our two days there flew by so quick, we just didn't want to leave. 
We will most certainly be back to this hotel. I'm still in shock at how amazing it was and how lucky we were to stay here!",5,2019,08,09
217,Outstanding hotel and nature,"Hotel is amazing, service and hotel staff really professional and friendly. Room was spacious, bright and clean. I would recommend eggs Benedict for breakfast- the best one I ate in my life. Pool and spa so enjoyable and relaxing. I don't have one word  to say against this hotel- pure pleasure and highly recommended 👌 if you book you won't regret your stay here",5,2019,08,09
217,A good stay but maybe undeserving of 5*s,"Spent the weekend here with friends. We had high expectations mainly because of the price as a 5* luxury hotel. Check in was swift and we were upgraded to a lovely Mountain View room which was lovely. The rooms are a little tired and quite old fashioned. Very much catering for the USA visitors as is the whole hotel and decor. Not really to my taste. The outdoor areas were a little dirty and unkempt. 
Staff were very friendly but service was a little slow and not sure the staff were of 5* quality. A lot of young students who didn’t really know their foot and drink when asked. 
Spa was lovely and treatments were excellent. Very high standard here however pool was overrun by kids. I understand there are kids times but I didn’t feel a spa was a place for kids. Kids are welcome everywhere which I nice if you have kids. If you don’t bring your own however this is just irritating when you’re trying to have an adult break away. 
All in all we enjoyed our stay but I was a little underwhelmed if I’m honest. We spent over €1600 and I expected it to be a bit more special.",4,2019,08,09
217,Disappointed,"Very disappointed. First, the confirmation I received for my room, they didn’t have. They did adjust however received probably the worst room on the property. That wasn’t the worst, they were painting the area by the elevator and my room was right there(I have bad asthma which I told them). I called immediately and was told they would try to find me another room and would call me back. Never received a call back. I called 4 hours later and was told they would note it and switch the following night. Next morning I went to the front desk, they said they would check and get back to me. I left them my mobile phone. Needless to say, 7 hours, no call. I checked back at 5 pm and was told (as it seemed it was the first they heard my request).sorry nothing they could do. I understand it is high season however the devil is in the details. They should have noted they were painting and at minimum gotten back to me. I am a titanium elite for life member, not that that even matters, but I feel since I was using points, a lot of points, they gave me the worst room. 
I stayed at this property a few years ago and had a great experience. I would stay clear and I will never go back
Attached is my room view",1,2019,08,08
217,Romantic night break,"My husband and I had the opportunity to stay at this hotel for 1 night during a weeks visit to Ireland. It came highly recommended by our friends .
It is one of the most beautiful hotels I've ever visited. The location is simply stunning. We made use of the pool which was very relaxing . We dined in Sika. The meal and service was faultless.
The only thing we had an issue with, was the technology in the room. Seriously why does everything electrical in the room have to be powered by a pad ??? We unfortunately discovered during the night that my husband had no way of turning on any lights because the pad that was meant to be at his bedside wasn't there.Also no where beside bed is there a source to charge a phone either. This resulted in him hurting his foot on way to locate some light. I approached reception about this in the morning and was flippantly dismissed which was disappointing. Apparently he shoukd have phoned at 3am to get it fixed !!! I did email management and was offered an upgrade for a return visit which was nice however to be honest I don't know when we would be back to in Ireland to use. So make sure you make sure that all pads are where they're meant to be. ",4,2019,08,07
217,Afternoon tea at Powerscourt Hotel,"Very impressed with this recently opened hotel in close proximity to Powerscourt estate.

We called in for pre-booked afternoon tea which was on time and excellent if a little expensive at £40 a head !

From what we saw of the public areas everything was exquisitly/tastefully decorated and the staff we encountered were friendly and attentive at all times",5,2019,08,06
217,Outstanding!,"This is by far one of the nicest hotels we have stayed at. Everything is top notch and everyone was amazing! The only issue we had was that we had to wait about an hour and a half for our room but it was well worth the wait. Honestly, we didn't mind having a couple cocktails after our flight in their tea room with the beautiful view. It was just a lovely experience.",5,2019,08,06
217,Room with spectacular view,"5 star in nearly every department. Greeting by concierge and car parking, room, food. Only flaw was answering of in house phones for room service. Rang out nearly every time. Room not serviced early in the day and queues at check in and out reminiscent of a fast food takeaway!",5,2019,08,06
217,Another AMAZING stay at this SUPERB hotel,"This was our 5th time to stay at the WONDERFUL Powerscourt Hotel as our anniversary and my birthday both happen during July. Each year my lovely husband has booked a one night stay here as special treat as I just love it but this year he booked a 2 night stay for 30/31 July with a spa experience included which was a fabulous surprise. On our arrival at 4pm we were over the moon to be advised that we had been upgraded to a suite. A lovely, friendly young porter helped take our bags to room 212 and WOW is all I can say. The suite was magnificent with a huge balcony overlooking the fountain with the stunning Sugarloaf Mountains as a backdrop. The were double doors leading onto the balcony from both the incredible  sitting room and the perfect bedroom which led into a separate dressing room area and then into a huge bathroom with a separate shower and toilet. I just love that a portion of the mirror in the bathroom turns into a TV which is the same in all the rooms we have stayed in previously. There was also  a huge fully fitted kitchen and another toilet area.There is an iron and iron board plus a professional hairdyer in the bathroom. What a start to our 2 day break. We then changed and headed to the leisure area around 5pm to chill out before heading out for a meal at 7.30pm. When we arrived all we could hear were screams from children and discovered there is a children's club from 4-6pm and also from 9-11am. We actually have never checked in before 6pm so had never been aware of this. We then just used the sauna and steam room area which is for  'over 16 only'  and then about 5.40pm we ventured into the jacuzzi area which is in with the beautiful pool. This also has a sign saying 'over 16 only' but some parents brought their tiny children in with them! A member of staff had to eventually come over to advise them children were not allowed to use it. I left to get ready for the evening so I did not get the use of the pool but my husband stayed on a little longer and said that shortly after 6pm all the children had left and the lights were dimmed over the pool which is how it would normally be and that's when you get the full effect of the stunning swarovski crystal laden pool. After a lovely breakfast in the beautiful sun filled Sika restaurant which overlooks the Sugarloaf mountains we headed to the Espa spa. My husband had booked a Summer Essence spa package for me which included use of the the thermal suite and lunch and he booked to use the thermal suite facilities and also to have lunch.The thermal suite area is on the 2nd floor of the spa and is separate from the leisure centre area so guests have to pay 24 Euro to avail of it There are 'male only' and  'female only' rooms which each have a sauna, steam room, heated stone loungers plus a beautiful Infinity pool which we were so looking forward to using which overlooks the gardens and then a huge serenity room with reclining loungers, magazines and refreshments for all to use and this also overlooks the gardens. Unfortunately we were informed that the Infinity pools in the thermal suite area were out of order which was so very disappointing but I must mention that as I had a treatment pre booked and my husband was staying to have the lunch which costs 25 Euro the staff advised him that they would not charge him to use the thermal suite that day due to the maintenance issues...now that is real Customer Service. My treatment was booked for 11.30am so after availing of the amenities I waited to be called. I had such a lovely therapist but unfortuanately I didn't get her name. The treatment took 1hr 30 mins and included body brushing, sea salt scrub, head massage and scalp treatment and a wonderful facial. I then headed to the serenity room where my husband already was and we totally relaxed there till our lunch at 1.30. What a fabulous surprise I had when arriving at our table to find a tray with some chocolates and 'happy birthday' written on it and a card from the staff in Espa. I was overwhelmed. The lunch consists of a soup, a wrap , salad and a dessert plus tea or coffee and it was delicious. We then returned to the thermal suite to end off our lovely day.We had a late checkout till 1pm on our last day and after another lovely breakfast we headed to the pool at 10.50 as knew the children's club finished at 11am and had a wonderful last hour in the beautiful tranquil pool and jacuzzi. 
I cannot praise this hotel high enough and we have never received anything less than 5 star treatment anytime we have stayed. Our 2 day break felt like a week as we were so relaxed and treated so well. Unfortunately for my husband I will now be hoping to continue to be surprised with 2 day breaks from now on ha ha. Thank you to all the amazing staff for making this such a special time. We wish you continued success.",5,2019,08,06
217,Look elsewhere for 5 star experience,"Nice room and grounds. However my wife, child and myself just felt like an inconvenience there. Talked to other friends that have stayed recently and have had the same disappointed feeling. Has completely lost their Irish charm. Had said they'd provide ""an upgrade or an amenity"" for my wife's birthday, they forgot, twice... After been reminded twice we eventually got a jug of orange juice... It was like a present from a child's birthday party, not what we expected for €500 for a 2 night stay. Expensive, impersonal and deeply disappointing sums up the stay.",3,2019,08,04
217,Omg! Amazing!,"This has to be one of the most fantastic hotels I’ve stayed in, hotel is around one hour from the centre of Dublin and 45 minutes from the airport.
Grounds are beautiful, fantastic golf club.
Entrance is breathtaking.
Grounds are well maintained and stunning.
Rooms.....out of this world.
 I had a single room, this had a dressing room, huge bathroom with separate bath and shower.
Two queen size beds, fully stocked fridge.
Facilities, beautiful pool, amazing spa.
Breakfast....what a selection....anything you want to be honest, if it’s not there, they will get it for you!
Would love to go back!",5,2019,08,04
217,Beautiful Hotel and Area,"Beautiful hotel, with lovely grounds and easily-accessed walks and local village (Enniskerry).

We stayed for a 10th wedding anniversary. Although there was some mix-up over our room, ultimately the kindness and professionalism of the staff made it a very memorable stay! My wife was delighted! :) 

The food in the Sika restaurant was excellent --- we had an outstanding dinner and breakfast there. Breakfast at Sika, overlooking the Sugarloaf in perfect sunshine was unforgettable. Afternoon tea in the Sugarloaf lounge was also a great experience.

Special thank you to Lezette for coordinating flowers and advice, Silvana for her photography (and charm), and Paul for patience and kindness.

We'll be back.",4,2019,07,31
217,Lovely property but I'm not sure about 5 star status,"When we arrived we were delighted with the beautiful setting.  However, we drove to the front entrance and there was no one there to help us.  It was only after we got out of our car, pulled one big bag, three smaller bags out of our trunk and started walking in with them did someone come out and insist on helping.  
Our room was lovely and spacious with a view of Sugarloaf.  The grounds are beautiful so that evening we wanted to enjoy the view outdoors with a drink but were told there was a private party going on. You would think they would have some space for paying guests.
The next morning we went out for the day and upon our return the heavy end tables by the bed were turned at 45 degree angles. the window had been opened, the bathroom garbage can was sitting on the tub and the mini bar hadn't been replenished.  I don't believe it ever was.  In addition, the shower had quite a bit of mildew.
We went to the Irish pub in the hotel a couple of times in the evening and service wasn't great.  Don't know if they were understaffed or just poorly trained.
So, would I return?  I'm not sure.",4,2019,07,30
217,"Nice hotel, poor service","In short, at over €300 a night in a 5* hotel we were very underwhelmed. Hotel itself is nice but service is very poor.
2 night stay off to a very poor start... checked in at 3.35 and told check in didn’t open until 4 so a room would be ready shortly thereafter, so we left 2 numbers and went to get a drink. At 5pm we went back to reception and a room still wasn’t ready, we were told it would be a further 10 mins, and only after my husband asked, we’re we offered a complimentary drink. Still no word at 6pm so we went back to the desk and were then given a room key and told they had tried to call us at 5.30- we didn’t have any missed calls. At no stage we’re we given an apology. 
Nice big room with traditional decor which is my taste, however it looks a bit dated. A bottle of prossecoo was brought to the room for our birthdays, advised reception we don’t drink but told that there was no non-alcoholic alternative. Told she would speak to someone and see if she could do anything- we never heard anything more about it.
The grounds of the hotel are fine but not the best maintained. Some paths with planted areas to the sides are covered with weeds. 
Pool area is lovely and they have a well equipped gym and variety of classes on, one of which I participated in. 
A standard selection available for breakfast. We found staff to be very sharp and not overly helpful/friendly. Bacon and mushrooms cold, fried eggs had uncooked egg whites. The second morning we order pouched eggs which were much better.
Great location though with lots to do in the local area. 
All in all an average experience.",2,2019,07,30
217,60th Birthday Celebration,"Checked in on 22nd July and got upgraded to a beautiful suite - much to my surprise! Stunning room...and stunning bathroom! Everyone we met during our stay were friendly and professional- from reception, restaurant and bar staff...to the gardeners working in the beautiful gardens! Dinner the Siks was superb...and when we retired to our room....we found a bottle of Prosecco, chocolates and a birthday card for my partner....just WOW! Thank you!",5,2019,07,27
217,Absolutely beautiful!,Just stayed two nights at Powerscourt and was able to get upgraded to a suite. It was one of the largest I've ever stayed in and was absolutely gorgeous. We had a lovely early dinner in the Sugarloaf Lounge and enjoyed an amazing meal at Sika. Even the vegetarian entree was outstanding. My only regret is not having afternoon tea in the lounge.,5,2019,07,26
217,A truly wonderful stay,"My husband and I stayed recently for our 20th wedding anniversary.  From the moment we arrived the service was outstanding from being greeted at reception at check in they mentioned and congratulated us on our anniversary to the prosceco with chocolates delivered to our room and then at dinner a special plate with Happy Anniversary written on it.  All these special touches don't even come close to how special this hotel makes you feel.  Every staff member is warm and welcoming and truly makes you feel you are the only ones they are dealing with.  As for the spa....how to put into words the glorious facial, the vitality pool and last but not least the relaxation room where we could have stayed all day.  This is somewhere where we will most definately return",5,2019,07,26
217,Best hotel we have been in so far!,"Myself and wife visit hotel on 10 july this year. We used spa facilities, one of the best! Ide like to mention Christine for making in Espa for great treatment and making us feel comfortable, A1
Service in hotel is at the very best, all staff members are very attentive and treat every customer polite and professional. Would return back, highly recommended hotel!",5,2019,07,26
217,A truly special experience,"I attended Powerscourt hotel last thursday & we were all treated like royalty! We went to the bar for a few drinks & dinner. Our room was so incredibly kept & the view of the mountains was just spectacular! We finished the evening in the lounge overlooking the sugarloaf! 

The breakfast the next morning was truly delicious! 

On Friday we went to the spa, and my therapist Taijana was out of this world. She was friendly, kind & I can say she provided the best Spa experience i have ever had. She chatted to me about all products, procedures & the scents. I was truly impressed. 

We were also met by Michelle, the Spa manager, she was so friendly & made us feel so welcome & she was incredibly professional. Both Michelle & Taijana are truly a credit to your spa experience. 

I will definitely be returning again soon!!",5,2019,07,25
217,A Unique Hotel Experience,"The Powerscourt Hotel - Autograph Collection has changed my opinion of Marriott - from ""meh"" to marvelous! I only recently became a Marriott member because I do not normally like large hotel chains. I seek out the ""different"" and ""off the beaten path"". I booked my first night in Ireland here because, after a long flight, I wanted comfort and predictability. The hotel is just under an hour from Dublin airport at the north end of beautiful Wicklow County. But I was so happy with my experience here that I booked 5 additional nights at the end of my trip! The classic rooms are very spacious and the one bedroom suites are a true luxury. What made this experience excellent was the extraordinary service from the concierge/guest relations team. From booking to arranging tours and transport to greeting me by my name when I was passing through the lobby, they made everything easy and enjoyable. Thank you Robby, Lezette, Danielle! The location also is excellent for touring both the shore and mountains of Wicklow. I took two tours with a driver along both routes. In short, highly recommend!",5,2019,07,25
217,Room Needed Maintenance,"This hotel is set in a garden next to Powerscourt Garden. The lobby and sitting area was very well done with lots of beautiful flowers. However the Sika Restaurant looked very dated and tired as scrapes on the floor and could use a refurbishment. We reserved a large suite, #452 but it was very oddly shaped and in bad need of maintenance touches (woodwork nicks, floor scratches, caulking). The bathroom was quite pretty though. For this price we paid, I expected more. I’m sure that the resort had more to offer than we took advantage of. I only stayed there one night, so didn’t spend a lot of time enjoying the grounds of the hotel. I was surprised that the room did not have a turn down service, so no chocolates placed on our pillows in the evening. Bummer.",3,2019,07,24
217,Amazing stay,"Just returned from an amazing weekend at the Powerscourt Hotel, a really exceptional stay. We opted for a suite, which was huge, well appointed and had stunning views over the Sugerloaf mountain. The staff were friendly and courteous, taking extra care to get to know us and even come over to say goodbye when leaving. The spa was beautiful, despite the fact it maybe didn't have all the bells and whistles we've seen in other hotels....but the giant crystal in the steam room was pretty cool. Around the grounds you can explore the amazing gardens of the Powerscourt manor house, do a whiskey tasting in the distillery or even walk into cute Enniskerry village. Will definitely be making a return visit soon.",5,2019,07,22
217,Standards of excellence,"Everything about this hotel is perfect the whole ambience is that of quality and good service without being snobby and pretentious.
To be honest my sense of direction is poor and no matter who i asked of the staff when i was lost they we're helpful an friendly in fact thats what i remember. There was a lovely older gentleman doorman as we were leaving he wished us a safe journey home and to have a nice day, its those little comments that make a good hotel a great hotel and a very memorable experience
I stayed in a suite which id highly recommend it was decadent an classy the beds and pillows very comfortable with a huge balcony that overlooks the beautiful garden. It also had very modern easy to use touch pad by the lights an beside the bed to control the lights and air con which was very handy .overall i could not fault this hotel i had breakfast delivered to the room which was delicious and enhanced a very relaxed enjoyable experience",5,2019,07,19
217,A truly wonderful hotel.,"Cannot recommend this hotel highly enough. We just completed a fantastic week long stay and enjoyed it thoroughly. One of the most spacious, clean, comfortable hotel rooms we’ve ever stayed in, and we typically spend 30+ nights a year in luxury hotels worldwide. Great shower, nicely appointed bathroom, and lots of closet storage. The televisions were big and new. The entire hotel was very clean and well maintained. And all employees were friendly, helpful, and readily available. Only negative was Sika restaurant, but we thoroughly enjoyed dining in Bray each evening (an easy drive, or 16 euro taxi). Hope to return here again and again - so much to see and do in the area.",5,2019,07,17
217,Special,"Terrific hotel. Gorgeous location. Unbelievably service - polite, generous and kind. Quite, extremely comfortable accommodations. Restaurants all delicious. Near gardens and waterfall. Town is a walkable distance but hotel will also provide a ride.",5,2019,07,15
217,"Overall lovely, some issues","Stayed one night at the end of our Ireland vacation - a perfect way to unwind from vacation!

The good: 
1. beautiful property!
2. Check in was smooth and Larisa was so kind, upgrading us to a very nice room.
3. Dined in Sika and good was very good 
4. Location next to Powerscourt Gardens is a big benefit
5. Mossy the bellman/valet was a rockstar the entire stay

Not so good:
1. Service in Sika and in the casual main lobby restaurant were very slow. Should not have to search out wait staff to get our bill.
2. Out suite was on the front side with a beautiful balcony view of the service and storage building. The lights stayed on all night-consider dimming in the evening so guests can somewhat enjoy the skies.
3. On departure day the front desk was not good-Larisa was very rude, rolling eyes, when I requested a later checkout (as Marriott Platinum late checkout is a benefit). Finally agreed to 2 pm however when we went to room at 1:30 to prepare for departure we couldn’t get in the room. Larisa said that we should use the new key-but she never gave us a different key.  Very negative end to an otherwise wonderful property.
4. As others indicate, the beautiful scenery could be better appreciated it there were more public spaces to sit outdoors and enjoy a snack or cocktail.
5. Hotel runs a shuttle to Enniskerry on regular basis but would be nice to make shuttle available for transport to the gardens as well.  The walk is fine but I could see it being a challenge for elderly or even if you’re in a hurry-which we were based on our late checkout issue.

Overall really a great experience but with an isolated issue at the close.",4,2019,07,15
217,Best staff,"Staff is beautiful  was so happy with this excellent host staff so friendly and so lovely with name Niamh
Bartender Joe is with best skills making amazing coffees maybe a bit slow but showing best performance 
Manager Diana so friendly and helpful 
Big thanks for all staff Chloe Maite Nicole Sam",5,2019,07,12
217,Tessy Con,"I stayed at this lovely hotel for the weekend. We had a great stay and enjoyed every aspect of the hotel.
The grounds and location are extra special, this brings me to my next observation, the only way to enjoy the outside (weather permitting!) is in the main restaurant. I feel the hotel lacks in its connection to the outside space. The gym Is in an amazing location but I feel it is wasted, it would be a perfect setting for a bar/casual dinning area that opens out.
The bar/bar food was also a disappointment. However the food in the main restaurant was very good.
Overall we had a great stay and will def return.😊😊",5,2019,07,09
217,Simply superb,"Powerscourt is a wonderful tranquil place. The hotel is staffed by wonderful people. From the moment you arrive, the doorman is helpful and friendly, the check-in staff and the concierge Robbie is a mine of useful information. All the staff are delightful and treat us throughout our stay as if nothing was too much trouble. Simply first class.
Very good Irish breakfast. 
The rooms are very spacious and well kitted out, some with breathtaking mountain views.
The swimming pool/hammam/spa is very nice.  All in all a wonderful place and I Would return again . . . and again.
Powerscourt house next door is a lovely bonus.",5,2019,07,08
217,Incredible stay! Wish I could give more than 5 stars!!!!,"I have thoroughly enjoyed my stay so far. So many incredible people work here. From the Concierge Lezette, people at Espa Spa to the housekeeping and front desk staff, I have encountered nothing but warmth and professionalism. They have all gone completely out of their way for me. 
 
Breakfast at Sika was delicious. Room service was fantastic. I thoroughly enjoyed the vegetable stew.

I am traveling alone before a business trip to Dublin and would not pick another place to stay to enjoy peace and spa time outside of the city. My room has a fabulous view of Sugarloaf Mountain. I am going on a private tour organized by Lezette later today to see the sites in the area. Do not think twice before you come.",5,2019,07,07
217,Mixed feelings about this stay,"This hotel quickly became our favorite when we stayed here for the first time a year ago, we have since stayed 3 times. The hotel is lovely but lacking in certain areas for a 5 star.
Firstly, check in is always an ordeal and takes way too long. I had even checked in using the BonVoy app, but this made no difference. We were assigned the wrong room/ package initially but this was sorted out after some discussion amongst the reception staff. 
The rooms are really nice and the bed is super comfortable, but again small things like one of our robes was fluffy and had the hotels emblem on it, the other was tatty and frayed. 

The spa is nice, but each time we visited the pool it was kids pool time so it was impossible to swim- I think there should be one designated swim lane for adults and then the kids can have the rest. 
There were no staff on duty to watch over the kids either, we had to get out of the jacuzzi as we were getting splashed in the face repeatedly by kids bombing into the pool beside the jacuzzi. I have no problem with kids having fun but I think there should be some consideration given to everyone else there trying to relax and this is the hotels responsibility. 

Overall it is a lovely hotel and I probably will stay again.",4,2019,07,04
217,Fab Rooms & Spa,"Come here regularly for spa days which are always fab. Therapists are exceptional and treatments are always perfection. 

Only issue would be therapists need to tell people in the relaxation areas to stay quiet as it can occasionally get noisy and is supposed to be a quiet room. Also need to notify people not to leave things to keep beds while having their treatment...it's not a sun lounger on a package holiday to Benidorm!

The suites are fabulous and beds extremely comfortable, always a pleasure to stay. 

Breakfast is fantastic.

Only bad thing about the place is Sika restaurant if you are in the room to the left where the aircon does not seem to work. The room gets incredibly and unbearably hot and uncomfortable. Food is generally very good but difficult to enjoy in the uncomfortable room temperature.

Staff throughout the hotel are wonderful, friendly and helpful.",4,2019,07,03
217,Fantastic stay!,"Myself and my husband just had a 2 night stay in powerscourt. Having been to a few different spa hotels in Ireland, I can honestly say that none even come close to powerscourt. From start to finish, we were so impressed by the staff, service and all round experience. While booking a few months ago, I casually mentioned we were getting married a few days before and we’re going to Powerscourt for a mini honeymoon. They made note of this on file and upgraded us to the most beautiful suite. As if this wasn’t enough, there was a complimentary Bottle of
Prosecco and some macaroons on arrival.

The following morning when we went for breakfast, we were greeted by the friendliest staff. We both commented on how accommodating and friendly all of the staff were. 

We then went for aromatherapy treatments in the espa spa. These were 50
Minutes each. I go for a lot of massages in different places and this was by far the nicest one I have had. Mine was done by Karen who was just brilliant. The experience was so relaxing and she really took the time at the beginning to
Go thorough the different oils she would be using. My husband had Colette and also commented it was the best Massage he had ever had.

We later at dinner in the silka restaurant.
It was one of the most enjoyable meals we’ve had in a long time with fantastic service. The steak was just beautiful.

I can honestly say we will most certainly be going back and I would highly recommend powerscourt. A completely luxurious experience from start to finish!

217,Afternoon tea on a sunny afternoon,My third time to have afternoon  tea here and it was just as enjoyable as on previous accasions. Have been to numerous establishments for afternoon tea and I think the Powerscourt Hotel is right up at the top. Will be back again.,5,2019,07,02
217,Great staff great hotel,"Stayed here for 10th wedding anniversary. From the moment we arrived staff were great. Room was very good, unfortunately didn't get the balcony we were hoping for, worth asking for balcony.  Food good, bar went for old Irish pub theme which may appeal to foreign visitors but being Irish felt we could have visited this kind of pub anywhere in Ireland.  Live music in the bar was good. Overall great stay.",5,2019,07,02
217,Hotel is Excellent - SIKA restaurant - Good food - not great service,"The grounds, hotel rooms, amenities of this hotel are wonderful. We had stayed there before and decided to spend our 30th anniversary here - dining in the SIKA restaurant.  The food was delicious - the service was poor.  We were a party of 4 - not demanding or requesting substitutions.  We were shown to our table, handed our menu and barely settled, when waiter back for our order.  He proceeded to do this a couple of times - we ordered wine and food within 7 minutes. It was our 30th Anniversary and we were not in a rush.  Wine arrived and was served - after that any replenishment of wine was done by us - our waiter never came back to replenish. Meals arrived and they were delicious but no one asked if we needed anything or if all was ok.  Someone else cleared dishes and same waiter came back to provide dessert menus - with clear instructions that he would be back in 2 minutes for our order.  While he was waiting on other tables he never came back for our order. Someone else took our order but we were not offered more wine, coffee or tea.  
We had dined here before and loved it - this is why we chose to celebrate our anniversary here.  Greatly disappointed.",3,2019,07,01
217,Beautiful grounds and location,"I just came back from two nights in the Powerscourt Hotel & Spa (June 24-26). We arrived at 6am and were originally told check in was not until 4pm, however since we are platinum members they were able to find a suite for us that was ready. The suite was really an apartment (room 702)! It was a gorgeous ornate room for us to rest and relax. I loved the grounds of the hotel and how beautiful it was to drink tea overlooking Sugarloaf. 

The only downside I would say was with the concierge- we had booked multiple activities with the conciregeand were not told we would need to book transportation or how far away the activity was/when to be ready. It would have been informative to be told at the time of the booking that the activity was 30 min away etc, so we could plan accordingly.

Overall this was a wonderful experience and we plan to return.",4,2019,07,01
217,Anniversary getaway,"We stayed here for one night for our anniversary. Beautiful hotel, warm reception. As it was mid-week and the receptionist knew it was our anniversary - we got upgraded to a suite - facing out onto the fountain at the back. Absolutely stunning room. 2 bathrooms, a living room, super king bed, balcony large enough to have a family bbq on, 3 tv's (one being in the mirror of the bathroom, a dressing room, and a bathroom/shower room in size to rival the ground floor of my house. All the staff we came in contact were warm, professional and extremely good at their duties. 

We chose to eat in the bar and I have to say the manager was excellent. Food was delicious and very filling. 

The spa area is dimly lit - I think to help relax you. I found it quite nice but my partner's vision wouldn't be as good as mine and found it hard to see anything. Swimming pool and jacuzzi are kept clean, staff in the spa area were also professional and attentive. 

For breakfast the following morning there was a great selection of food, I got an omelette made, and my partner was sorry he didn't get one as well - I was the nicest I've tasted. 

Overall this was a very pleasurable visit for our anniversary and we thoroughly enjoyed ourselves. Well done to all the staff for giving us an exceptional stay - we really appreciate it.",5,2019,07,01
217,Birthday Weekend Treat,"I just had a lovely birthday weekend stay at Powerscourt. It really is a lovely hotel set in the most magnificent location surrounded by mountains, forests, lakes etc. I'm a regular visitor to the area But this is the first time I stayed. 

My visit started with a SPA treatment (another first for me) and I think I might be hooked! Kristina (from Estonia) was my therapist and I have to say she was excellent! She worked out every knot in my body during my deep tissue massage. The whole experience was so relaxing and everyone there was extremely friendly and professional. 

We checked into room 222....nice room, decent size, super bathroom and possibly one of the best showers I've used in a long time. 

Just a few points to note:

The TV in the bathroom just switched itself on, for no obvious reason. The remote for the TV in the bathroom didn't work so we had to switch it off at the fuse box to get it to turn off. 

The TV doesn't swivel fully to face the bed so watching T.V. isn't comfortable. 

The Air Conditioning unit, although it sounded like it was on, absolutely wasn't working so, unfortunately, I had a pretty uncomfortable nights sleep as the room was so warm. There were no obvious window openings. 

The mattress was pretty bad, unsupportive and uncomfortable. It needs to be replaced. 

I left some notes for housekeeping about some of these issues (minor) but I not sure if they've been addressed. 

Breakfast the next morning was great, very, very busy but well executed. Good array of fried foods, pastries, fruit etc...staff were attentive and professional. 

I thoroughly enjoyed my weekend and would love to return again.",4,2019,07,01
217,Extraordinary stay,"This hotel is absolutely stunning. The area, the garden, the room, staff, the food. We loved this place so much that we didn't want to leave. Is a great place to relax. We could imagine a beautiful wedding to have there one day. We loved the view and huge balcony, the room was so spacious, pool and saunas very relaxing. We will return here for sure.",5,2019,06,28
217,Pure bliss,"What a beautiful experience from start to finish. The breathing view as you arrive in the valley is just a foretaste of what's to come. Beautiful building friendly staff top class food and amenities ...""I mean what's not to like"" highly recommended.",5,2019,06,27
217,Amazing experince,"This hotel is one of a kind! The rooms were exceptional, the service was beyond compare, the meals were delicious and skillfully prepared and the pub was as good as any you'll find in any Irish village.  We cannot say enough about this hotel.  It has truly become a destination for me and my family and we'll be sure to visit again on our next trip to Ireland.

You won't be disappointed.",5,2019,06,27
217,Loving it,"I debated whether to stay in the city or here: I made the right choice. There's Enniskerry/Dublin bus service to Dublin (44).

I also debated whether to rent a car: glad I didn't. I took Aircoach from the airport to/from Bray (bought ticket in advance) and it was super-easy. I enjoyed the ride more than I would have if I was driving. I couldn't locate an Uber when I arrived in Bray, but I found a taxi in fewer than ten minutes. The Powerscourt was about ten minutes from Bray by taxi.

PROS:
- Used points, so stay was free. Bonvoy awards five nights for ""cost"" of four
- Used Suite Upgrade award, and was upgraded to a suite (thanks!)
- Complimentary breakfast (have the eggs benedict). Good coffee
- Hotel responded quickly to emails before stay
- Easy to get to/from the airport
- Huge deck, covered with openings to room and living room. Great view, table to sit at outside, fresh air and natural light inside
- Suite was very large, with a kitchen (oven, refrigerator, espresso machine), walk-in dressing area, foyer, bathroom with separate room for toilets
- Room was dark, quiet, clean, and I could control the temperature. This qualities are most important!
- Amazing views from room and lobby
- Powerscourt Estate is next door, and is definitely worth the price of the ticket to see the gardens. Restaurants (indoor and outdoor), stores open to public. There's a gourmet market so you don't have to eat every meal in a restaurant at the hotel
- Enniskerry is a twenty-minute walk away (shuttle service available). Charming town. Sit outside, have a beer, and watch the people and their dogs go by
- Excellent walking at the River Walk (take a left at the Powerscourt Distillery). Get the code from the concierge (it's gated). Code changes every Monday
- Panels for Do Not Disturb, Clean Room, temperature control, lights. Bedroom panel is conveniently located in drawer next to bed
- Universal adapter/converter in room
- Beautiful bathroom: large walk-in shower, large tub, white marble, crystal, TV in mirror, two sinks, upscale toiletries

CONS
- No top sheet. This hotel trend needs to end already
- The ""do not disturb"" was often disregarded
- Pub lacks atmosphere
- Radio/TV in bathroom kept coming on (246 haunted?)",5,2019,06,26
217,Beautiful venue!,"We thoroughly enjoyed our stay here.  The grounds were beautiful and the staff was most friendly.  I will definitely stay here when I return to Ireland!  Easy access to Glendolough, and the Wicklow Mountains are serene backdrop.",5,2019,06,26
217,Excellent Hotel,"Our family stayed in the hotel for a weekend in June, 2019. We spend an amazing time together in the Spa area and within the hotel's garden. It's a brilliant place located with a view to the mountains. We wish a big thank you for all the staff working during our weekend and personally a BIG thank you to the Reception employee of Greta. She was very welcoming and informative of the hotel and its amenities. Polite and light tone of voice helped resolve our few questions we had over the course of our stay.",5,2019,06,26
217,Almost great,"There is a lot to like about this hotel but still missing a few things for me. 
Pros:
Convenient location to Dublin
Very pretty property
Food was good in both Sika and McGill's Pub
Got upgraded to a mega large room
Got some Macaroons for being a Marriott Gold.
Golf Course (East) was reasonably priced, pretty, in good condition and played well
Spa, fitness center, steam room and pool were all nice

And the cons
Bikes are advertised as being available both on the website and on billboards, but were not
Hotel room was extremely warm.  I called and they said would send a fan, but it took 3 calls at 11 pm to get a fan (Which helped but should have just been standard issue in the room)",4,2019,06,25
217,30th Wedding Anniversary ,"We celebrated our 30th Wedding Anniversary at the Powerscourt Autograph Hotel in Enniskerry. Our mountain view suite had the most amazing views. The suite itself was very spacious, room after room. However, the bed was so comfortable once your head hit the pillow, we were out for the count!
We had room service and our evening meals at the Sika Restaurant. The food is absolutely outstanding and so well presented.

All of the staff were very welcoming from the time of arrival until we left. They were helpful, courteous and this also included the chambermaid staff.

The estate has the most remarkable grounds. The lakes, the visit the waterfall, the house and gardens itself.

We will need to revisit to simply see everything as almost a week is not enough to appreciate the whole estate. 

A huge thank you to everyone at the Powerscourt and I need to mention the staff at the Spa and Dave at the door who was extremely helpful and knowledgeable.

We highly recommend a visit to this wonderful estate.

Thank you ",5,2019,06,24
217,Nice experience not far from Dublin,"We stayed here for 3 night during the conference in Dublin. Hotel is located some 20km south of Dublin, but is easily accessible using public transport. We rented a car, and it was quick and easy drive. There are plentiful parking spaces available. Check in was quick and efficient. Upgraded into one bedroom suite, which was roomy, clean, modern and had luxurious feel. All controls were digital using electronic panels. Everything worked well. Wi-fi free and fast. Bathroom in marble. Only negative experience was very soft bed, and mattress felt tired and old. Breakfast was ok, plenty of high quality choices, but could be really crowded at times. Property is very nice, with plenty of walking possibilities. Would come again.",4,2019,06,24
217,Beautiful hotel in a spectacular setting,"What a beautiful hotel!  From the moment we arrived to the moment we left we adored this hotel.  We loved that it was not a typical large chain hotel.  The entrance is spectacular and the sugar loaf bar has a truly unique vista.  Rooms are large and spacious, we had a suite with a large terrace and could have stayed there forever.  It was particularly nice to have a large amount of wardrobe space and the bathroom was huge but more importantly the bed and pillows were extremely confortable.
The first night we had dinner in the only restaurant in the hotel which was very good, but has just a fixed three course dinner.  The second night we ate at McGill's bar which serves great homely food and was totally delicious.  The only complaint I would have is that the Sugar loaf bar stops serving food at 18h.  We were not hungry and wanted just a sandwich or salad and our only option was to order room service.   The sugar loaf bar is open for drinks so I didn't understand why they couldn't serve the same food as is available on room service.",5,2019,06,23
217,Lunch,"Stopped in for lunch on Friday with my girlfriend. We were met at the door and welcomed inside by a friendly porter. Then we walked up to the sugar loaf lounge where we waited to be seated.
After been seated we were given the menu and asked if we were staying at the hotel.
When we ordered our food we asked for no onion jam or rocket on the steak wrap and the turkey wrap as on the menu and two diet cokes. 
The waitress didn’t ask how we would like the steak cooked or many questions at all and just took our order in her head so we accepted this and waited for our food.
I went to use the bathroom and when I asked the male waiter he just pointed and said it’s down that corridor. Surely he should have walked me over when it’s a 5 star hotel!!
When I got back I was surprised to see two glasses of water on the table but I accepted that and waited on our food and drinks while looking at the spectacular views(the reason it’s a 3 star review)
When our food arrived the steak was undercooked and there was rocket on it which we specifically asked it not to be included and we never seen or got our diet cokes.
I presumed the waitress would come by and check if our lunch was okay but this never happened so we ate what we could walked to the counter and paid a hefty €41.50 for very very substandard service.
Surroundings are lovely and it’s a beautiful hotel and the porter is a lovely man but the waiting staff need serious training.",3,2019,06,22
217,Staff have character! ,"Absolutely blown away by the people working here. Though there were few minor issues with our room, particularly air conditioning and water temperature, the staff were great in offering assistance and exhibited good use of initiative to cater to our needs. 

Engineering failed to fix our air conditioning so the room was overbearingly warm when we arrived back from avoca. This was an issue a gent from housekeeping solved by bringing us two much needed fans.. which isn’t ideal but it certainly helped for our stay. 

Conor from concierge was very polite and helpful as was Valdez. 

Housekeeping was very good and our room was kept as clean as it was when we arrived. Thank you for the great service! In particular Adriana was very nice and genuine over the phone and even came to try fix the broken hairdryer in the mirror that a man from engineering said they can’t do anything about, so thank you very much for going above and beyond outside of your role as housekeeper and proposing alternatives for my wife to dry hair for dinner.

Sika was wonderful, very good quality food and efficient work rate from staff!

Overall our experience was fabulous! It would be 5* if issues that were ‘unfixable’ didn’t exist. Though staff efforts in general and characters made up for it. 
Would definitely return.",4,2019,06,22
217,Wonderful hotel,"This is the first time I have stayed at a hotel where I was personally emailed beforehand, which was greatly appreciated. As a frequent Marriott guest, I used one of my upgrades here and received the most amazing upgrade after what seemed to be a slight confusion on what kind of room I would receive. The room was amazing.

Unfortunately, I only stayed here one night so I did not take advantage of much else. However, we did have dinner in the pub. The food was reasonably good although a tiny bit overpriced. The biggest disappointment of the trip is that live music does not start until 10:30. The staff failed to keep the tables open that they were supposed to (as we overheard), thus the music did not get started until more like 11, by which time the pub had pretty much cleared out. Music should start by 9. The money they will make on people buying more drinks far outweighs the three tables lost at this time. 

As a Marriott member, we also received a welcome gift of breakfast, which I very much appreciated. 

The hotel is lovely. You should stay here for two nights if you can! The Wicklow Mountains are almost as lovely as better known spots like the Dingle Peninsula.",5,2019,06,19
217,Beautiful Hotel fitted for Princess,"Woww and woww.. all i can say about this hotel. From the entrance to the room, we were constantly in awe how beautiful this place is and how well manicured the ground is. The staff at the front desk were the greatest, very welcoming, kind and accomodating. We only stayed there for one night and didnt get a chance to enjoy the whole amenities they had to offer. Truly truly sad. It simply means we just have to come back here for longer stay. And hubby agreed to that idea. Our mountain suites was Fantastic all the way. Next time i just have to bring my princess dress with me. Its only walking distance to the powerscourt garden and very close to the powerscourt waterfall. Perfect!!!",5,2019,06,18
217,Fantastic!!! ,"I booked for an overnight stay to celebrate our wedding anniversary. It was inclusive of breakfast, dinner, and visit to the Powerscourt Gardens. My daughter decided to go with us a day before our stay. So I chatted online with their staff and Angelika was very helpful and made me understand about the changes in rate which was very reasonable. On the early morning before we checked in, I message Angelika again if we could request a room with a beautiful view. She told me yes of course. Less did we expect that we were actually UPGRADED TO A SUITE! Room 516 was really amazing looking over the courtyard and the views were very panoramic. The suite was very well stocked with all bathroom and shower needs. The sitting room and the walk in closet were very big. The two queen beds were very nice and comfortable that we snored the night away. The breakfast and the dinner were equally fabulous. To top it all, the service from all the staff was generally excellent. Everyone was very friendly and professional. From the reception, door men, house keepers, and restaurant crew, we can't admire them enough. Just want to thank you all for making our stay very memorable on the occasion of our wedding anniversary. ",5,2019,06,18
217,our experience ruined by a rude member of staff,"we reserved a mountain view suite and got a very nice room with balcony.

the hotel and public areas are impressive. we had only a short time at the hotel and we spent it all on some small problems at the room, such as the bath was broken etc.

so we couldn't enjoy neither the hotel nor our expensive room.

but what completely ruined our stay was the attitude of jose gonzales at the reception
 that denied all the problems and even called the hotel security because i raised my voice.  this is a disgrace for such a luxury hotel.

I am very experienced with luxury hotels and about 70 years old and never had such a bad experience.",2,2019,06,17
217,Amazing staff!,"Roisin from reservations was honestly superb! So polite and genuine on the phone she made us feel special and was extremely accommodating! Would definitely book through her again! Stephen the manager was also amazing! I must say the bartenders, Joe and Sam in the lounge were fantastic and so friendly! Definitely some of the best cocktails I’ve had in a while and five star service! I would recommend to all my friends!!",5,2019,06,16
217,Relaxing all around,We enjoyed a nights stay is the stunning hotel and gradens and one night is not enough to enjoy its beauty. We walked the gardens then spent a relaxing few hours in the spa followed but a gorgeous meal in the restaurant. The staff were wonderful and service was great. Our schedules at the time only allowed us one night but on the next stay I will be staying a few more nights to explore the gardens and village.,5,2019,06,11
217,Amazing Service,"The hotel is absolutely beautiful and the staff are all amazing. Our room was gorgeous and we were given a beautiful view by the front desk.

From the beginning of our stay Mossi assisted us and provided stellar service and friendly conversation. Every time we interacted with him he had conversations with us and assisted with whatever we needed. He went above and beyond our entire stay. Robbie at concierge made great suggestions for our day trip to the cliffs, giving us a full itenerary and arranging transportation. He also followed up with us to make sure it went well. 

All the restaurant staff.. Two girls at afternoon tea whose names I didnt get (blonde and brunette) were very friendly. Gentleman at the pub who seemed like a manager made sure we were taken care of and constantly checked on us. Naimh at front desk was also very helpful.",5,2019,06,10
217,First Communion - Superb,"This weekend we held a first Holy Communion event at Powerscourt Hotel. We booked a function room and we were assigned Alma Kenny as our planner. Alma’s style comes across relaxed and laid back but she delivered 100%. I can not recommend this hotel as a venue for a special event highly enough, the food and service was exceptional. Special praise must go to Alma, she was outstanding and is a credit to this hotel. She did a remarkable job and I would not hesitate in recommending her as the planner for an event. Many guests advised that this was the best party they had attended and this was due a lot to Alma’s planning and attention to detail. Every aspects was 10/10, put this hotel and Alma on your shortlist.",5,2019,06,09
217,A little bit of Heaven,"Had a wonderful 2 night stay in this hotel . Everything was faultless from welcome to departure: ambience, decor, food ,room, staff  all excellent.
It really is a very special place and staff have got everything right in terms of making guests feel relaxed, comfortable and in a very unique environment. A haven of peace and delight, an escape from the hurly burly of every day life and a place to recharge and reinvigorate.",5,2019,06,09
217,Overnight at Powerscourt Hotel,"Top class.  My wife and I enjoyed both the Room and the Dinner.  It was one of the most perfect dinners I have ever had:  Mozzorella salad, the sea bass, and an extraordinary pineapple parfait - it was just so new, and flavours were brilliant, and measured in all respects excellently.  The Room was huge and well enjoyed.... though if I go again I will see can I get a room with a vista, perhaps overlooking the gardens rather than the restricted, although leafy, view that we had.  No complaints.",5,2019,06,06
217,First class hotel,"As guest since it was a Ritz-Carlton hotel, we stayed 2 nights in May before leaving for a vacation for 14 days.  We got with no problem a upgrad-room with very friendly staff at the reception. The food at the restaurant is excellent,  The rooms are top. We will return end of august.",5,2019,06,06
217,Beautiful Stay,"Booked two nights at Powerscourt to start our two week Ireland vacation and to get over our long travel day. Our suite was simply superb, over 800 square feet of pure luxury looking over the Wicklow Mountains. First night we ate in the pub and the menu was what you might expect in a pub. My wife and I both had Fish and Chips which was excellent. We attempted the full Irish breakfast the next morning but sadly were defeated. Each plate was more than  bough for two people. Wonderful meal in their restaurant the second night. Powerscourt is not cheap but our two night stay was the perfect way to start our trip off. ",5,2019,06,05
217,Wow,Myself and my husband stayed here last weekend for our wedding anniversary and we were not disappointed. From the minute you get to the door of the hotel you are met with the most pleasant and helpful staff. Service was great. The rooms are huge and spotlessly clean. The gardens are beautiful and well kept. Food in mc gills bar was nice but would have loved to eat in the sika restaraunt but we ventured down to bray which is close by. Breakfast on both mornings was gorgeous we got it delivered to our room on a set table with a heated cabinet to keep it hot. We visited powerscourt waterfall which is a short drive away. It was beautiful. Bring a picnic if it's a nice day. You can hang around amongst the beautiful scenery for a few hours and take it all in. I would love to come back here in the future. Maybe for our next anniversary. ,5,2019,06,05
217,Fantastic,"We stayed for our friend’s 50th Birthday and we were not disappointed. This is a stunning hotel and the staff are it’s greatest asset. Everyone we encountered were so helpful and efficient, but one member was outstanding and that was Robbie Smith. Robbie was fantastic, and went out of his way to help us organize our friend’s birthday celebrations and so so helpful during our stay. We had dinner downstairs and it  was excellent and breakfast top notch too. Our most spacious bedrooms  with balconies were interconnecting with beautiful views of the Sugarloaf.",5,2019,06,04
217,A Truly Delighful Stay,"We stayed here in May, the night before our flight back to the US.  When we arrived in the motorcourt, we were promptly met by a valet and a umbrella yielding lady (just like Mary Poppins) who ensured my wife did not get wet.

The building and grounds are beautiful,  We were given an upgraded room and were on our way in under 3 minutes.  The bellman escorted us to our room.  Our room was amazing....foyer with closet, bedroom, sitting area, all marble bathroom, and a full bank of windows looking our to our balustered patio.

This was probably the largest and best non-suite room we have ever stayed in.  It was stunning.

We had wine in the reception room, overlooking Sugar Loaf.  We had dinner in McGills and the food was wonderful and the service very attentive.  

Powerscourt Hotel is among the best places I have ever stayed.  Our only disappointment is that we only stayed one night.",5,2019,06,04
217,Almost Perfect,"This is close to best hotel we have stayed at. The food is first class, friendly if slightly spotty service. The location must be second to none.
The golf was great...... sadly noone was able to switch off the hurricane force winds !
Highly recommened",5,2019,06,04
217,Disappointed,"The hotel does not live up to it’s 5 star rating. Very disappointed in the maintenance of the grounds. It didn’t look like there was much done to keep things up. Our hotel windows were dirty and had cobwebs in them, there were cigarette butts in various areas on the grounds, and the gardens around the hotel had weeds and looked run down.
In our room, the tv didn’t work ( they did come to fix, but were unable to) and the phone wouldn’t ring the front desk. We were offered to be moved to another room, but it was already late and we were settled for the night. 
Just overall disappointed with the whole experience. I expect a 5 star hotel to be beyond my expectations and this one did not. We will not return for another stay.",3,2019,06,01
217,Absolutely Fantastic,Stayed in the Powerscourt Hotel for 1 night. Its probably the best Hotel we have ever stayed in.We had a suite overlooking the Sugar Loaf.The surroundings are amazing.Every member of staff we met were so friendly and accommodating. We ate in McGills and the food was gorgeous. Breakfast was fab. I booked before we left for August. I got a great deal. The next time we will be trying the Restaurant for Dinner and afternoon tea.,5,2019,06,01
217,"Big, bold, beautiful, brilliant!","One of the most impressive hotels I’ve every stayed in, with huge, comfortable rooms, stunning grounds and first class facilities. Relatively close to Dublin but an oasis of tranquility. I would highly recommend a stay here.",5,2019,05,26
217,Amazing stay!,"I stayed here with my partner for our engagement celebration. We were upgraded to a suite, which was extremely spacious and lovely! The staff in Sika were fantastic when we had dinner. The gave us complimentary champagne & brought us extra treats after dessert for our celebration. The grounds are lovely for a walk round & the breakfast had a great selection. The hotel staff really went out of their way to make this a very special occassion for us!",5,2019,05,25
217,Pure luxury and excellent service,"Despite arriving early our room was already ready and we were able to check-in which was fantastic. The rooms are very spacious. Especially loved the TV in the bathroom and the separate closet room which had plenty of space for luggage. We were blessed with wonderful weather and enjoyed an afternoon sitting on the restaurant balcony, taking in the awesome views and drinking wine. Life doesn’t get much better. The indoor pool area is very relaxing with comfy loungers and a great jacuzzi. Couldn’t fault a thing. Will be back to stay again.",5,2019,05,23
217,"Great food, great location but the stay was not perfect","We booked a two night stay B&B and one evening meal during the Easter Weekend. We had not booked dinner on that night so decided to eat in McGills pub. We had the wings to start & both had the buttermilk chicken burger for main. It was very busy, but the waiting staff were attentive and the meal itself was very nice. 'Pub Grub' but very tasty.

The Spa was completely booked out but I booked on short notice so I don't mind that. I sent my wife to another SPA nearby and she loved it.
Breakfast on morning one was very tasty, fresh and a great variety.
Breakfast on day two was a little surprising. We went to the restaurant but were told there was a 20 minute wait for seating even though there was clearly plenty of seating available. We were given the option of having it in McGills but that has no views so declined and waited . We were seated after 10 minutes . We both ordered from the menu but after 15 mins had to ask again as there was nothing coming. My wife subsequently ordered a tea so that we could sit outside and enjoy the view , but the tea never arrived. We decided not to follow up and left after ten minutes. I gave this feedback to the front desk at the time and they asked if I would like to speak to a manager. I declined and asked the receptionist to pass on my comments.
So a little disappoint with some aspects of the weekend given the cost of a two night stay , hence the four star review. But overall it was a pleasant stay and I would definitely stay here again.",4,2019,05,21
217,Beautiful hotel in stunning location.,"Our two daughters, our daughters partner who were home from Australia and my husband and I stayed in this hotel for one night to celebrate my birthday.  From the minute we entered the hotel until we left we were treated like royalty.  We were all upgraded to beautiful suites.  Our room had an outdoor heated balcony with seating area and an uninterrupted view of the Sugarloaf Mountains.

Champage, flowers and a birthday card were delivered to our room which I thought was a lovely personal touch.  We ate in the Sika restaurant and the food was delicious.   The waiting staff were so friendly and attentive.   Without being asked they brought out deserts with candles.

We spent a very enjoyable couple of hours  in the leisure centre which is beautifully decorated in black and gold with amber lighting.

We found the staff throughout the hotel to be so friendly, courteous and willing to go the extra mile.  We have all done a lot of travelling but we found this hotel to be one of the most luxurious we have ever been in and well worth it's five star rating.

We will definitely be back the next time we are celebrating something special.",5,2019,05,21
217,Best of the best,"This hotel is amazing! 100% 5 star.. the staff where really pleasant and accommodating with any request you had. The hotel is spotlessly clean and decorated beautifully. Fab views all around and the sugarloaf mountain to the back of the hotel gardens. We had a superior room on the 6th floor and it was so lovely. huge living space, big bed and fab bathroom. These rooms have a balcony area with seats and table. We ate in McGills restaurant and the food was delicious. The manager didnt have the wine I requested but he offered me another wine for the same price which was nice. The pool area is lovely, just the water is a bit cold. I will definitely recommend to friends as well worth the money, its such a treat!",5,2019,05,20
217,Superb Hotel and grounds,"We stayed here over Easter with our 8month old baby. We had a great time at this hotel. Our room was so spacious it was great to let the baby crawl around and explore. As it was Easter the hotel was extremely busy which was a little off putting as it was hard to get tables and lunch etc but we didn’t let this annoy us. The pool was only open a few hours for the kids each day so you had to plan around this. The breakfast was lovely, you could choose the buffet or order from the menu. They staff were also very helpful with giving us some snacks for later for the baby. We ate in two of the hotels restaurants and bars and enjoyed the food. The hotels main bar is downstairs and there is no windows which was disappointing for us. It’s nice to sit and have a drink and look at the views. Overall a nice stay and hope to be back",5,2019,05,20
217,Afternoon tea - I'll return,"The lounge is to the rear of the lobby of the hotel itself, with a wonderful view of the surrounding countryside. Lavish décor but beautifully done and very comfortable.
Plus points: Professional service, tables set in white linen. Tables, although small,  were well-spaced, allowing for private conversation. The tea itself was composed of four sandwiches, two scones and five cakes, all beautifully presented.  The sandwiches were extremely creative and tasty, almost worth the journey just for the sandwiches.

Minus points: No complaint about the food. Itself, which was superb. I have a number of comments on the service, which will have to be added separately.

Comments: Despite the difficulties in booking, the quality of the afternoon tea was excellent (but vegetarians may be unhappy with the lack of sandwich choice, only one of the four sandwiches on offer were vegetarian friendly). In addition to the traditional strawberry jam to accompany the scones, a pot of lemon curd was provided.  This was of excellent quality and provided a welcome zing to the scones.
",4,2019,05,17
217,Best Hotel Visit Ever,"This Hotel was a dream come true.  Terrific rooms, outstanding staff, and spectacular views that make your heart soar.  If you stay at one hotel in Ireland, this is it!  Make sure you see Robbie, the head concierge, as he will give you the absolute best advice on the area.  Walk through the number 3 ranked garden in the world (National Geographic) and be blown away.  Have an opportunity to interact with Owls, Falcons, Hawks, and majestic Golden Eagles with a Brian.  Flying hawks is a must for your bucket list!

With three restaurants, a river walk, a distillery, and plenty of apples to feed the horses, this Hotel has something for everyone.  Get lost on the trails with 200+ foot trees towering above you, bringing you back to medieval times.  Thank you to the team at Powerscourt for making memories that will last a lifetime!",5,2019,05,17
217,Wow!!!,"Stayed here with family and a few friends. Apart from the physical wow of the drive, sense of arrival and decor the staff were the real wow! Friendly, efficient and caring. Ate in Sika wow, drinks and cocktails in the pub..wow and afternoon tea in the lobby...double wow. First class hotel with first class stays. Has the wow factor. Booking family in for Christmas!",5,2019,05,16
217,Wish We Had More Time,"This was the last day on our week long driving tour across Ireland. We arrived too late to see of the attractions, but the hotel and ground are stunning. We lucked into a complementary dinner because our living room TV didn’t work. BTW - this place is so fancy it has a TV on the mirror in the bathroom and doorbells outside the room.

The dinner and view were amazing. The breakfast was also equally fantastic. I wish. We had. More time.",5,2019,05,15
217,Lovely Hotel,"We stayed here for two nights as part of a driving tour of Ireland.  We were upgraded at check in to a suite and it was luxurious, comfortable, and spacious.  The bathroom was opulent with every possible amenity needed.  Bed had beautiful linens and pillows.  The grounds of the hotel were wonderful for walking as it is next to the Powerscourt House and Gardens.  Only negative part of the trip was that the second evening of our stay, the pub was not open for dinner because of a private function.  The only other options were a 5 course fixed price dinner in the upscale restaurant or eating in the lounge which was serving a lunch/snack menu.  We didn't want a heavy meal but the lounge menu replicated our lunch.",4,2019,05,14
217,"Good, but room for improvement ","We visited this hotel today for afternoon tea. I made the booking 2 weeks ago by telephone. I was asked if it was a special occasion and I explained it was my mothers birthday. The lady was helpful and said that something special would be done for my mother. I telephoned yesterday morning to confirm the booking and was told that they could not find it and someone would call me back.  A nice lady called me shortly afterwards,  she took all the details again,  which made think there was a hiccup with the booking.

I have not visited the hotel in years and it's a beautiful property.  It was buzzing on arrival.  Our table was well presented with beautiful crockery, glassware etc. The staff are very welcoming and a very friendly lady took care of us 

There were a few shortcomings.  Tea was served,  but we had to wait 10 minutes for milk.  Then there was a longish wait for the food whilst we drank the tea. We were a large family group, so once a pot of tea arrived,  it was emptied quickly. Took a while for tea to be replenished,  so some of us paused eating, until more tea arrived. Given the high price point, guests should not be waiting for tea and milk. 

I had expected a little birthday treat for my mother, regretfully there was no treat. We had ordered some beverages on arrival,  not available,  but appeared on the bill, removed as soon as we pointed it out.

Great staff, but the service experience from booking confirmation to our dining experience needs a bit of attention and TLC.  If management can get this right, then its 5 stars!",4,2019,05,12
217,Wow wow wow!! Love it ,"What a wonderful treat this hotel is. Stunning piece of architecture and the room we had was to die for!! Like a small apartment beautifully decorated with very calming decor and view of the gardens at the rear.
Not cheap to stay here so it should deliver on every level and mostly it does. The staff are fabulous and nothing is too much trouble you really feel looked after. We ate at Sika from the fixed price menu and loved it and also had a lovely meal in the pub. Perhaps another restaurant could be available in the week as the 4th floor tea room closed at 6 which is a shame - maybe keep this til 8 as you don’t want a slap up meal every night. Breakfast was great during the week but too busy at the weekend - the staff tried hard but it became like a canteen by 9 o’clock - too noisy and lots of children running about. Our tip is go early and it’s calm and quiet 
The ESPA pool and facilities are great but again too busy at the weekend and became like a crèche on one day - stay midweek if you can and avoid the child friendly times. It was really missing a nice indoor/outdoor pool - like the Europe in Killarney! 
We sound critical - these are not things that detracted from our overall experience and we had a fabulous time and definitely will return but not at a weekend!!
Being next door to the fab Powerscourt gardens is amazing and loads of lovely walks around",5,2019,05,12
217,Fantastic hotel in a beautiful locataion,"Stayed here for a business weekend.  What a lovely hotel, set in beautiful grounds with brilliant service.  Our room turned out to be a suite and it was immaculate.  The best thing about this hotel apart from the lovely grounds, and beautiful interiors, were the staff.  The service was top notch.  I would love to return.",5,2019,05,11
217,A Wonderful and unique location,"From the moment I arrived at Powerscourt Hotel I was warmly greeted and entered a world of pure bliss and comfort. The staff are incredible, and pay attentive and kind service in every area of the hotel, from a superb breakfast, to a relaxing evening visit to the bar and lounge areas.
The grounds and views are magnificent, a source of renewal and inspiration.
This was my first visit and one of many to come.",5,2019,05,10
217,Amazing from start to finish,"We had the most AMAZING stay in Powerscourt last weekend. 
Niamh at reception was so lovely and advised us we were being given a complimentary upgrade for our 10 year wedding anniversary to a beautiful mountain view room with balcony on the 6th floor. The views were stunning, I would never bore of the view especially in the sunshine .  We received a lovely card wishing us a happy anniversary with a plate of chocolates included which was a lovely touch we thought. 
We enjoyed drinks in the sunshine in the secret garden and it was heaven. So relaxing and enjoyable. 
We ate in McGills bar and the staff were so helpful & attentive. Food & service were too notch. Breakfast was also fab with a large assortment of food. 
I enjoyed a swim & sauna down in the spa while my husband went to the gym. Both were we equipped with everything you would need. 
From start to finish we enjoyed our stay and couldn’t fault it.  As a couple with young children we rarely get away alone. We really didn’t want to go home. The hotel really made it an anniversary to remember so much so we hope to return again another time. 
Many thanks !!!",5,2019,05,08
217,Beautiful hotel and lovely employees,We stayed in Powerscourt for two nights during the Easter holidays. As we were traveling with our 6 month old baby we had a few requests during our stay. Every employee we encounterd was so professional and very helpful. They all ensured our stay was pleasant and relaxing. We have stayed in Powerscourt a few times and I have to say that every time we stayed we have always had a great experience. Thank you.,5,2019,05,06
217," Very nice",Great stay. Our room was large and very nice. It was clean and the bed was extremely comfortable. Glass doors opened onto a large balcony overlooking the property. Beautiful park like estate. The staff was very friendly. Definitely enjoyed our stay. ,5,2019,05,05
217,"Somewhat disappointing, needs investment","Can‘t help it but this hotel - set in a beautiful park and run by Ritz Carlton in the past - somewhat disappointed.

Arrival: easy with a Navi on board; sufficient parking available right in front of the hotel

Checking - in : fast, smooth, friendly, all good.

Room: at the very end of the right wing, well away from the noise of the reception area that is set on level 4 in the middle of both wings. Room 322 has a very good size, has a desk, a small couch area to watch TV, a small dining table and a Bedroom with a large King Size Bed. Attached Master-Bathroom is really nice, luxurious size. From the Master Bedroom, you have access to the terrace - also really nice.  Next to the sitting area there is another guest bathroom. 

So basically, this room has it all to make the guest happy. Except: the room is obviously not well maintained. THe curtain in the master bedroom were covered with HUGE yellowish stains (see photo); the door to the Bathroom had a major crack across the door blade. Same happened to the door leading into the Bedroom (see photo). I don‘t believe for a single moment that these things happened the night before, by another guest. The damages clearly looked as „older“. That however would lead to the question: do they notice - and if, why do they give the room away in such condition? Or if they have not noticed - how do they run the cleaning process in the hotel?

Looking at the entire building, I found more areas and spot that have obviously not seen any major maintenance or investment over a couple of years. 

Food: had light dinner at the Sugarloaf Lounge - very friendly service, very limited choice of food. Breakfast at the Sika Restaurant: good choice, friendly service, all good. 

WIFI: worked well throughout our stay.

Checking out: fast again, no complaints.",3,2019,05,05
217,Authentic and cozy ,"45 minutes drive from Dublin airport, this  hotel is really nice and welcoming.
The staff was very good, the room spacious and the bed very comfortable, I could have stayed much longer.
The location is beautiful and I went for a 10k run by the river which was great.",5,2019,05,04
217,Exceptional Resort Close to Dublin,"While we did encounter a couple of minor maintenance/technical issues, I can confidently say of this resort that any inconvenience caused by those issues was far offset by the beautiful surroundings, the elegant facilities and accommodations and, above all, the wonderful hospitality of the resort staff and their exceptional commitment to customer service.  We were so pleased we extended our stay by an extra day. Given how impressed we are with Ireland on this our first visit to the Emerald Isle, we intend to return. And, when we do, given how impressed we are with the Powerscourt Resort Hotel we intend to return there too.",5,2019,05,02
217,Nice,"Nice hotel, friendly staff. Stunning pool (watch out there are children times AND golfers who don’t like children in the pool at children times).  

Restaurants and food was good. Location is stunning. A nice place to remain a bit. ",4,2019,05,02
217,Great location and beautiful grounds,"The location of this hotel is superb, great views to the mountain and the Powerscourt Estate and Gardens are within few minutes walking distance. We had two rooms, both very large and the mountain views from the balconies were lovely. The hotel has great interior and exterior. The pool area was relaxing! Overall just perfect two days stay during the Easter.",5,2019,05,01
217,Anniversary stay,"we stayed here 2 nights for our 25th anniversary and got an upgrade to a suite which was superb- the only criticism was the bath which was difficult to get out of, other than that choice of breakfast juice (orange, apple and grapefruit) could maybe include cranberry/blueberry ( less acidic). The food in  both the bar and restaurant was good- especially the deserts in Sika",4,2019,04,30
217,Bengie,"Benji made our stay in the great ""downstairs bar "" where the food is delicious & the service was amazing Nail,Catherine Neeth on the front desk along with Katty & Naill were charming as all they wished for was that their guests were happy .Benji is a KEEPER for he knew exactly all our needs so as to make our night special --the front of the hotel has a super view of the mountains & sunday tea at the hotel is a must .we left feeling we must come back as this was our first time staying at this hotel thanks to Robbie Smythe the guest relations manager speaking with us before we left.",5,2019,04,29
217,What a location!,Love the location of the Powerscourt Hotel just outside Enniskerry.  The rooms are huge and I loved the marble bathroom with the large tub.  We ate in the Sugar Loaf which was casual and the food was excellent. ,5,2019,04,28
217,Great hotel outside Dublin,Beautiful hotel and grounds. The staff was extremely friendly (esp David at the front door and Tatu) and helpful. The restaurant and pub were very good and the breakfast buffet is amount the best I have seen. It is walking distance to the Powerscourt Estate and gardens which are also highly recommended. ,5,2019,04,28
217,Amazing,"Fab hotel. Staff so friendly and helpful. Definitely a 5 star. Spa was amazing. Relaxation room with views to the sugar loaf, superb. Our room for 3 of us was like a suite, 2 double beds & a king bed, sofa, desk. Tv in the mirror in the bathroom, just fab. Totally recommend this hotel",5,2019,04,28
217,A Lovely Hotel and Stunning Grounds,"I stayed overnight for a work event in a king sized room. The appointments in the room were fabulous- the sheer size of the room, the wardrobe area, and bathroom were impressive! Clearly a lot of thought has gone into sourcing top quality bed linens etc. The smart tv was great a well- I could mirror Netflix. 

The only thing I would complain about is the mattress. Or perhaps mattresses- there were definite dips on either side so they need to be replaced.",4,2019,04,27
217,Incredible failure in only an hour ,"Well thus is a first for me, writing a review before I've even checked in. I waited ten minutes in a queue to check-in, there's seems to be plenty of staff, but only two on the desk. When I finally got to speak to somebody, my room wasn't ready. Not a problem I thought , it's only 1pm, I'll have lunch first. Wow, what an experience! Looked at the menu but didn't feel like any of the fancy and complex things that pass for sandwiches these days, so I asked if we could have a simple round of ham and cheese sandwiches and a round of chicken and mayo sandwiches made up. I was told flatly no! I must order off the menu. I explained that the actually had all the ingredients on the menu, I just wanted them to be put between two pieces of bread. Again told absolutely not, you must order off the menu. I finally called a manager over and she acquiesced said I could have a simple sandwich. So, happy that food was finally on the way I looked for a wine, a nice white Burgundy preferably, however, they only had five wines on the lunch menu, none of which particularly nice. So I asked if I could see the wine list but was told that was all that was available. The chap telling me was young and  inexperienced, so asked another waiter for the hotel wine list, but again was told there's nothing more than what's on the lunch menu. I tried explaining that this was a five star hotel and you had to have more than five wines, but there was no moving them. Take or leave it, five wines is all we have. Finally got a manager who  again acquiesced and got me a wine list. Filled with hope I chose a good Montrachet. Unfortunately, after a long wait I was told the wine wasn't in stock. At this stage I was 45mins in with no food and no wine, I gave up, accepted the wine from the lunch menu and looked forward to sandwiches. Now I'm not sure how you can misinterpret a 'sandwich', but they did. Instead of a filling between two pieces of bread, they brought some multi-tiered giant wedge of breads and fillings. I sighed and took them, they've beaten me, and I haven't even checked in yet. I know five star hotels, Ballyfin being my personal favourite, this is not one, nowhere even near it. ",2,2019,04,27
217,Great break in a great area,"Just got around to doing a review of the Powerscourt hotel as I felt it could not be left undone. What can I say but it to be absolutely stunning from the building itself to the staff looking after us. We got to see all the departments and take advantage of all they had to offer. Owen upstairs in the bar looked after us brilliantly whenever we were looking for a nice inventive cocktail. My husband was especially pleased with the service in the SIKA restaurant which we had the pleasure of dining in. From the get go out waiter Jamie looked after us expertly and let us know about the history of the area as he mentioned he was a local which is great to see the hotel hiring locally. Now the foods had us speechless, my husband ordered the beef which was cooked to perfection and the chicken was beautifully cooked. The room was lovely with a great view of the garden and the ESPA was one of the most relaxing places I didn’t want to leave. 
Thank you very much Powerscourt it was an absolute pleasure staying and we will be returning very very soon!",5,2019,04,25
217,Girls Weekend - Easter,"Perfect for a weekend away. It felt a million miles away from Dublin but took less than 1hr to get to. The hotel was beautifully decorated for Easter and due to the weekend that was in it, the hotel was very busy. We ate in the bar and the food was amazing and reasonably priced. We also used the pool while we were and very much appreciated the Kid free hours. The weather for the Easter weekend was superb so sitting out in the garden was so relaxing. The rooms were a really good size, the bathroom had a tv so perfect for relaxing in the bath and the room service food was lovely. Highly recommend it for a relaxing weekend away",5,2019,04,24
217,Great stay over in a top class hotel,"Clear to see from the moment you walk through the doors what all the fuss is about.  From the time of booking to time of departure Roisin Mulligan was so helpful and a  credit to the hotel.  Will definitly be back, cannot recommend a stay enough to anyone considering staying over.",5,2019,04,24
217,Amazing ,"What a beautiful hotel . We’re only sorry we couldn’t stay another night but we’ll be back ! Everything about this hotel is 5 star . Staff are really friendly , the whole decor amazing & beautifully decorated for Christmas complete with the gingerbread hotel ! Our room was so spacious. We didn’t have a mountain view but really it didn’t matter . Ate in Sika both for dinner & breakfast with no complaints . This is one of our finer hotels in Ireland that is stunning in every way ! ",5,2019,04,23
217,Unbelievable Hotel & Property,This hotel is set in woodland area just 30 minutes from Dublin.  Fairly contemporary design quite different from what we saw in Ireland but terrific.  Sofia at Reception was absolutely wonderful.  Within walking distance of the Powerscourt gardens that are spectacular and beautiful 36 hole layout golf course.  We were upgraded to a suite that was nearly bigger than our house and included a balcony area that was huge.  Quite remarkable place.,5,2019,04,22
217,Well deserved break,"We stayed in powerscourt for 1night after a busy week. We had a fantastic stay.  Check in was quick and easy with room ready. Our room was spacious and very clean. We had the pleasure of having a chocolate bowl in our room which didn’t last more than 30 mins with my daughter. 
We had lunch in the lounge, it was out of this world. Service was quick and very professional. We enjoyed the leisure facilities. Well maintained. 
The dinner in the evening was just amazing. Food was very good, service was the best. We had a the pleasure of chatting to the manager Diana who advised us of few ideas of places to visit the next day. 
I would like to express my sincere thanks to Christian and his team. The staff has been amazing throughout our stay. 
We will highly recommend this hotel for a touch of luxury and a nice relaxing break. 
",5,2019,04,22
217,Luxurious rooms with great views!,"We loved our room at the Powerscourt Hotel.   It was huge with its own outside terrace overlooking the fountains, grounds and hills around the hotel.  Wished we could have spent more time here but it was our last night in Ireland.   Nice spa as well.",5,2019,04,22
217,Nice clean property with a cool pub downstairs,Nice hotel with beautiful views across the meadows and hills. The bathroom was a little small with very little space for your things. The gardens a few short blocks away is worth the trip. There are some cool little shops there to look in.,4,2019,04,19
217,Lovely short stay,"We stayed here for one night over the weekend. We booked a one bedroom suite and it was really nice, large and comfortable. The bathroom was great, big rain shower and a big bath tub, everything was super clean so no complaints. There was even a tv in the bathroom if you wanted it! I was sure a balcony/terrace was included in that suite type but we didnt get one...We ended up eating in McGills in the end. We were trying to decide where, but we thought the €65 fixed price dinner was abit steep for what was offered so we had a few drinks in McGills and ended up ordering from that menu. The food was fine, standard pub fare really. I had intended on using the spa that evening and again the next morning but was too lazy so never made it! Looked really good though. Overall we had a good stay. 
2 things: There was a constant smell of food (not in a good way)around the building, we were on the first floor (the restaurants are on floor 4) and the smell was very strong there! it was abit off putting.
Also there are a few parts of the resort that are looking abit run down, it could do with a good spring clean in places.",4,2019,04,17
217,Felt like a Queen,"The entire experience was fantastic, our room was incredible, the Spa area (pool, jacuzzi, steam room, sauna) the perfect ending to a day of touring the grounds.  It was a great deal for the price.  The breakfast buffet was so good.   I can't say anything we did not enjoy about this hotel.  A must when in Ireland!",5,2019,04,16
217,We'll be back!,"Stayed here recently and had a really lovely experience. It was great value for money. LOVED the Spa experience and Afternoon Tea. Really relaxing and well trained and excellent Staff.It was really spot on from Start to finish, we'll be back!",4,2019,04,15
217,February 2018,Spent a weekend here in early Feb. really not worth the money. Rooms and hotel amenities are good but service is bad. Waiting a long time for service in foyer area its really busy with afternoon tea at weekends. Food in bar on Saturday night was not good.  Long waits on both mornings for breakfast and very busy and buffet breakfast is below average for the prices charged.  Would not stay here again at those prices. Service and food make it a 3 star hotel. ,3,2019,04,15
217,Fabulous ,"From the long majestic drive in, to the food and staff this hotel is out of this world. The best breakfast I have ever had. The rooms and so spacious and comfy and there so much todo in the grounds of the hotel.",5,2019,04,14
217,Excellent from start to finish,"We had a lovely stay at the powerscourt hotel, the room was big and spacious we had great staff that took care of our needs, a special thank you to Katy on reception who was very helpful with assisting is with a future reservation ",5,2019,04,14
217,6th or 7th floor if you can!,"Very unique property. Has the look of a high end resort while also maintaining a historic feel and embracing the natural beauty abundant on the grounds. We had a 6th floor suite which gave us access to the huge balcony running the entire length of the building. Great views of the fountain and the surrounding mountains.  Take the short walk to the neighboring gardens, they are easily among the best in the world. We had dinner and drinks at the pub one night which felt surprisingly authentic.  They were fully booked for a convention that was taking place the same day as our arrival, yet they still made us feel welcome and important even though they were obviously very busy. ",5,2019,04,14
217,Lovely stay and great hotel,Rooms are lovely - especially if you get one overlooking the green area. Tasty food and plenty of choice. Spa is lovely also - though would prefer a darker and quieter relaxation area as a bit bright though has a great view.  Really good massage with plenty of pressure so recommend getting treatments.,5,2019,04,14
217,Afternoon tea,"What an amazing visit. Nice and relaxed staff gave space to sit back and chill And enjoying the food in a lovely setting. Will definitely be back. Would cater to
Any food allergies or requirements. Prosecco also went down a treat. 

Highly recommend going for a walk afterwards as we were stuffed",5,2019,04,13
217,A luxurious stay,"My family and I stayed for a night in the Powerscourt Hotel in Enniskerry. From start to finish it was pure luxury. We had wonderful cocktails in the Sugarloaf Lounge (with complimentary crisps and nuts) followed by a fabulous swim and sauna. I was blown away by our rooms, and having a paper delivered in the morning was bliss! But the piece de resistance was breakfast! Truly delicious and so many options. We rolled out! And the staff very kindly offered take away boxes full of pastries and muffins which made a lovely mid-day snack. Thank you to everyone who made the experience so memorable.",5,2019,04,12
217,Great hotel!,I recently stayed at the Powerscourt and was blown away by how nice this hotel was. And I didn't realize it was an Autograph Collection resort. The rooms were very modern and comfortable and the spa was perfect. Definitel a place to visit again!,5,2019,04,08
217,Beautiful Hotel,We stayed 2 nights recently and I can only highly recommend this hotel. Staff are fantastic professional and helpful. Room was beautiful clean and elegant. Bed was so comfortable. Great room service. Beautiful breakfast and huge variety.,5,2019,04,07
217,Just wow ❤️,"Stayed here on the 6th April and couldn’t recommend this hotel enough, checked in with, I think her name was savannah, she was the best so friendly and happy and made us feel so welcome. Food , staff and rooms amazing , the views are out of this world.. will be back soon. Thanks for an amazing stay ",5,2019,04,07
217,Wedding at Powerscourt,"Myself & Megan held our wedding dinner here on 30th of March.It was amazing!! Wedding coordinator Alma was superb, our every need was met with great professionalism. The food was amazing & dinner service was so professional, as were all the staff throughout our stay. We couldn’t imagine a more perfect day/weekend 
We would highly recommend Powerscourt Hotel & can’t wait to come back for future anniversaries!!",5,2019,04,05
217,Very quiet property,"We enjoyed our stay at the Powerscourt Hotel. Our room was very quiet, we never heard any outside noise or noise from other rooms. Most of the staff were very friendly and helpful. We loved the setting of the property, lots of places to walk outside and enjoy nature. The room was very large and comfortable. The bathroom was very luxurious, even more so than the sleeping area. Not sure if it had been renovated or if that is how it was originally but it was very nice. The beds weren't the most comfortable but not terrible.",4,2019,04,04
217,Another Amazing Stay!,"Another Amazing Stay! This was our 5th stay at the Powerscourt Hotel but first time back with our 2 year old son. From the moment we arrived every staff member we came in contact with was curtiuos and polite and nicer still all were smiling! Every member of staff made conversation with us and our son, which I thought was a lovely touch. 

Our room was beautiful, with amazing views and ample floor space for our son’s dinosaur collection. 

We had dinner and cocktails in the bar. The atmosphere was incredible and the food amazing! The cocktails were the best we ever had and again the staff were so polite, even getting our son a bottle of warm milk.

It was the perfect Mother’s Day retreat! The staff and management of the hotel certainly set the bar very high when it comes to their attention to detail, customer service and going the extra mile.",5,2019,04,02
217,Service is a huge let down ,"I have just stayed at this hotel for one night with my friend. I have stayed at this property on numerous occasions and each time service has been exceptionally slow.  I decided to stay again and see if it had improved and to my disappointment it had not.  In my opinion excellent service must go hand in hand with a 5 star hotel. I have stayed in 5 star hotels around the world ie. Emirates Palace, Jumeirah Beach Hotel, Parco del Principi Grand Hotel and Merrion Hotel Dublin and the service has been exceptional.  Management really need to act upon this as it is an issue, waiting 15 minutes for a staff member to take a drink order and then another 25 minutes for the order to arrive is unacceptable for a 5 star hotel.",4,2019,03,31
217,Amazing Staff,Andrea in the Sugarloaf Lounge was so helpful with her cocktail recommendations! As soon as we arrived she seated us wherever we wished and was very prompt and all around a lovely server. She made it a lovely experience for us 😁,5,2019,03,31
217,Special Occasion ,The Powerscourt Hotel is situated in a beautiful location and the building itself has the wow factor! Thanks to the staff especially Amy for making a recent birthday night away very special. Lots of little touches and extras were thoughtfully provided. The food in the main Restaurant was very high standard as was breakfast on the day of check out. Would have loved to stay another night!!,5,2019,03,27
217,Lovely,"We stopped in for one night on the last night of our 13 day visit to Ireland for our 25th wedding anniversary and it was just the perfect ending to our trip. We did not stay at such nice places as this all the way around our trip but this bed, and bathroom were incredible! We loved our trip and it was a very memorable stay! Always love Marriotts in the states as well.",5,2019,03,26
217,"Beautiful Location, Impressive Building, Good Breakfast, Most Staff try to Please...","We booked an overnight here as we were due to attend a rather elaborate, daylong Function in nearby ""Powerscourt Estate"" - the names are similar, and therefore a bit confusing.

Anyway, unsure of our ground, we contacted the Hotel by Email, and asked them (i) what we should do about ""Check-in"", as our Function was commencing around 2 p.m., and (ii) could they help us get there? They promptly advised us that they would (i) do their best to give us a Room when we arrived (well before the normal ""Check-in"" time), and (ii) would transport us by ""Courtesy Car"" to our Function.

So, on the day, a Room wasn't available when we arrived around lunchtime (no complaint from us), and they readily delivered us to our Function, also promising to collect us at an agreed time much later.

As happened, our Function wound-down earlier than anticipated, so we walked back the short distance, and got sorted with our allocated Room (we had, we should also say, had the earlier, annoying experience of an over-enthusiastic, unnecessary attempted Phone-Call from the Hotel, as we were attending a Function at which, we had stated, we did not wish to be disturbed, causing us to have to call back to ask ""Is there something wrong?"")

We got back - informed the excellent Concierge, Samuel, that he didn't need to send the Car for us - and got to our Room on the 6th Floor, and we were very pleased with it, in all respects apart from the really, really, frustrating complexities of getting Lights to switch ON or OFF (to get asleep, on one side of our Bed, we eventually had to disconnect a Plug, which is simply not good enough!)

After a great night's sleep (we retired pretty early), we enjoyed the very well-explained Shower facilities (the Hairdryer is a bit too well hidden), and found our way to the Breakfast area (Floor Numbers, and access to them are a little confusing in this Hotel).
So, ""greeted"" by a definitely ""efficient"" individual, (who was blatantly, and annoyingly, far more interested in his hand-held electronic device than actually ""engaging"" with Guests) we had Breakfast - the ""Cold"" array was extremely good, the ""Hot"" proved to be warm but rather tasteless, the (special order) Omelette my Wife had was very good, in her view.

We retired to briefly savour the pleasures of our excellent Room, and were extremely pleasantly treated as we ""Checked-out"".

Overall? We were reasonably impressed, and would consider coming back here - the attentiveness of Samuel and that lovely, amiable guy, David, on the thankless door-opening duty, would be an encouragement for us to do so!",5,2019,03,25
217,Simply fabulous as always...,"Lucky to stay again. My husband held a conference here.
Our suite was fabulous. My son.loved the bath as he watched tv and ate buscuits all at the same time.
The staff are amazing. Very friendly and very attentive. 
I had afternoon tea which was very lovely but not WOW.  Think I was spoilt elsewhere. 
It’s lovely for walks up to avoca and surrounding areas. 
My son and I paid a visit to the climate change exhibition at powerscourt house which was great and very educational. 
Thank you and hope to be back again.",5,2019,03,24
217,Afternoon Tea,Three of us regularly go for afternoon tea together (it's our thing!) and we would rate this amongst the best we've ever had! Stunning location - we unfortunately didn't get a window seat but it was still a lovely setting. The food was gorgeous (the goat's cheese eclair is literally one of the best things I've ever eaten!) and there was great variety - one of us is a vegetarian and she was particularly happy with her options. The service was very good too. The staff were attentive without being overly so and they kindly left us to chat until we were ready to leave - which was long after everyone else had gone! Definitely a five star afternoon tea experience.,5,2019,03,19
217,Always our Home Away From Home,"We may be a little biased toward this hotel as we were married in what was then known as Gordon Ramsay’s restaurant. This is a fantastic property and for us the best five star in Ireland. We stay in Powerscourt regularly and from Paul in reception to Christian the Food and beverage manager the service is second to none, just great.",5,2019,03,10
217,Fantastic nights stay,"Myself and my husband stayed here over Christmas. We were lucky enough to get an upgrade to A suite. The room was absolutely beautiful. The property in general is gorgeous and the gardens are amazing. We had a lovely lunch when we arrived and then had dinner in the restaurant, both experiences were great. We will definitely be returning. Thank you to the kind staff for such a great stay.",5,2019,03,09
217,Best coffee,"Just arrived from England and my friend and me stopped for a coffee and a nice walk in Powerscourt. The hotel was very quiet, and It had amazing views. We ordered mocha and cappuccino and Paulina made them. They were amazing,best coffee we have had in so long. The two managers,Florina and Ruta, helped us with directions and recommendations .They were very nice and helpful. Lunch was delicious. We Will be back soon for sure. Thanks.",5,2019,03,07
217,Wedding at Powerscourt,"Powerscourt is undoubtedly one of the best (if not the best) hotels in Ireland. My husband and I had stayed here a few times, and were already fond of it before we decided to get married there. Firstly, the view/ surroundings are breath taking, perfect for relaxation. The hotel itself is grand and beautiful, the staff are friendly and welcoming, and they make you feel right at home. The food is gorgeous, we were opportuned on two occasions to meet one of the head chefs, and he was a lovely gentleman. Our wedding planner was very professional, and very friendly at the same time. I can't recommend her enough. Everything was perfect on our big day, no complaints whatsoever. Powerscourt Hotel will always hold a special place in our hearts.",5,2019,03,06
217,Massage by Una,"My mum, my sister and I went here for my sisters birthday on the 28th January. We all got different treatments and I have to say my treatment was the best I’ve ever had. Una was so kind and never made me feel like she was in a rush and made me feel really comfortable. I got the ESPA body ritual which involves a body scrub. Una did this perfectly and comfortably, I never knew a body scrub could be relaxing. The treatment didn’t feel like it wet too quick or too long. It really was perfect. 
I’m getting married in June and will definitely be going back to Una before the big day.
Thanks again. 
Sarah",5,2019,03,05
217,Mini-Moon,"We booked the Powerscourt for our “Mini-Moon” as it wasn’t a huge distance to travel and had heard amazing things about  the hotel/staff etc. Also, look at it. It’s beautiful. We stayed in a Mountain View Suite, and it was everything we had hoped for and more. Beautiful rooms, comfortable bed, massive bathroom with a TV in the mirror. It even had a kitchenette, which we weren’t expecting! We ate in the bar and in Sika, both were delicious. The spa was fabulous. We would go again just for that alone. Our friends had bought us an Afternoon Tea as a wedding present and it was the highlight of our few days away. The staff at the hotel are all exceptionally polite and cannot do enough for you. 

So why only 4 stars? Well, on our last night someone attempted to gain entry to our room whilst we were just nodding off to sleep. Thankfully, I’m the person who turns every lock and puts on security chains but it was a frightening experience as the door did open with quite a bang! We did raise this at checkout the following morning and were promised that it would be followed up... but it’s now been 4 months and we haven’t heard anything back. So I’m taking a star off for that. It hasn’t put us off going back but I do feel it would have been nice to hear it was looked into.",4,2019,03,04
217,Good but not great...,"Short break with two kids. Room was not ready until 4pm, despite hotel not being full. Given what must be the noisiest room in hotel- 436....AVOID...furniture scraping from 11-12pm and again early in the morning from presumably the restaurant below. E-car charging only works if you have a Tesla. How many of them have you seen in Ireland!?!? Pool was lovely but we left two sets of goggles down which “disappeared”.... Ate dinner in McGills. We ordered a bottle of wine which arrived not full. Food was good but service was slow.",3,2019,03,02
217,Afternoon Tea with a view,"Cannot fault the food or service in the Sugar Loaf Lounge. Even on an overcast day, the setting was still beautiful. We got a lovely warm welcome from Niamh, and Nicole couldn't have been more attentive serving us. Highly recommend for a treat.",5,2019,03,02
217,"Overnight, dinner and Spa",Must be our 15th visit to this most beautiful setting with a hotel to match. Wicklow is The Garden of Ireland and this place is the Garden of Wicklow. The Espa Spa is consistently good and well maintained. Well trained and friendly therapists. The F&B offering is excellent. Prices reflect a 5 star experience but it’s well worth it. ,5,2019,02,28
217,Disappointed,"Having stayed here before we were really looking forward to a second stay. In booking the reservation, I had made a mistake and booked one night instead of two which was eventually sorted by reservations staff and I was reassured that it would be no problem, they would be back to back bookings and we wouldn’t have to change rooms for the second night.

On checking in it took some time to explain about our bookings but we eventually got to check in to the beautiful room with a lovely view. On checking in we asked if the Sugarloaf lounge would be available for dinner that night only to be told it was serving “light bites” to 6pm only. After a walk I asked at reception again but was told the same information. We decided to eat in the bar. When we arrived at the bar, I can only describe the scene as chaos. No structure and nobody seemingly aware of how to deal with a busy evening of guests. We asked the bar staff how to go about getting a table and were told just to wait for a free one. We double checked about the sugar loaf lounge and the bar staff told us it wasn’t serving food and if we didn’t want to wait we could get room service. I do not pay to come to a 5* hotel to have room service! When we got a table, the food was average and the service was excruciating slow. Waiters inattentive and not on the ball; really below par for a hotel of this size. 
We decided to go for a drink in the sugar loaf lounge after only to find that they were serving dinner. Not sure how a reception staff can be unaware of the nights that one of their restaurants is serving evening meals!

The next evening after returning from a fabulous hike, the housekeeping manager knocked our door to ask us why we hadn’t checked out. Again, poor communication of information that our two bookings had been made back to back and as such we had been assured it would be treated as one booking. Felt this to be very unwelcoming. I spoke to guest relations who did apologise and sent our welcome amenity to us right away; albeit an entire day late.

We did eat in the Sika restaurant - staff and food were lovely as were the staff in the sugar loaf lounge. However so disappointed with the standards of this hotels communication skills and guest relations so doubt we would return for a third time.",3,2019,02,28
217,Birthday Afternoon Tea,"We loved our visit to Powerscourt Hotel today.  We had a lovely afternoon tea,  it was delicious!  
We noticed our tea cups,  milk jugs & tea pot were a little dirty,  they defiantly could of done with a polish!! 
Was a little bit disappointed they didn't have happy birthday written on the plate or anything as when I was booking it they asked if we were celebrating anything.  
We had a beautiful walk around the grounds afterwards. 
Looking forward to returning and visiting the gardens! ",4,2019,02,24
217,Spa day and night in hotel,I cannot fault any part of my stay at powerscourt. From the moment I arrived our car was brought to the car park and we didn’t have to do anything ourselves for the rest of our stay. When we came in our room was so luxurious and a gorgeous mountain view. In the restaurant the food and cocktails were delicious. When we arrived in the spa we were welcomed by beautiful ladies who took us to our treatments it  was a beautiful relaxing experience the spa was immaculate and smelt amazing !!! You didn’t want to leave ! All the staff were very friendly and everyone had a smile on their face. A lady named Kellie Ann who I believe was the manager of the spa made it her business at lunch to ask everyone how they were and made sure they were enjoying their day . Would highly recommend if you are looking for a unwinding stay.,5,2019,02,22
217,Beautiful hotel but...,"We checked into our room early, which was great but there was no one to shows us where our room was. The hotel is huge so as you can imagine one can easily get lost. Regardless on our mystery tour met housekeeping staff on the stairs who kindly carried my bags and my mums to our room and showed us the different features in the room, thank you very much Wayne! My mother loved the conversation about Elvis, it made her day! 💕 

Our room was clean, cosy and very like a beautiful apartment! We had a kitchen and balcony with an incredible view! The room had a nice divide between the bedroom and living room! 

We had a fabulous evening in Sika, but the food was slow to come out. However it was so yummy that the wait was worth it! 

The spa and pool is absolute heaven. The ladies in the spa are very friendly and welcoming so thank you for that girls, particularly Sara for her positive energy!

The worst part about our experience was our departure. It was too hard to leave such a beautiful place! We will be back in the summer and will be counting down the days until then!

217,Amazing stay ,"We stayed here last night , this hotel is luxurious from the very start . The staff on reception were super friendly and that’s how we found the rest of the staff for our stay . The food in the restaurant was of a very high standard and we throughly enjoyed every course . We also had a spa treatment which was again amazing . My therapist Lola , made me feel as relaxed as I have in years . I would highly recommend this hotel to anyone ! Keep up the good work ! ",5,2019,02,20
217,almost perfect but restaurant a let down,"i booked this night away for my husband as his christmas present, i thought as it was the night after valentines it would be an excuse for a night away from the kids. we arrived down early and we were delighted to find that we could check in early at 2pm as our room was ready. We got a beautiful delux mountain view room with large balcony. Very spacious room with large bathroom and huge bath, lovely walk in wardrobe with plenty of wards space for his and hers, the mini bar was very nicely equipped with everything you’d need and a nice touch was the nespresso machine too. As we had dinner booked for 6:30 that evening in the Sika restaurant we were delighted that we had time to go to the spa for a swim and jacuzzi. We loved the pool facilities, really relaxing with dimmer lighting and chilled music could have stayed there forever!- however had to go and fresher up for dinner . when we got back to the room i decided to have a bath as the bath looked so inviting!, the water was however brown even though we let it run, it did not phase me too much as i’m
sure it’s only lime but nonetheless would be better if it wad clear.  We went to the sugarloaf lounge for one drink before dinner and then in we went to the Sika restaurant. we were brought to a table near the window between two other couples which was fine, although most of the restaurant was empty at this stage. Our we were given a dinner menu which was fine, although i would have preferred a la carte and didn’t realize when booking that there is another restaurant in the hotel that does a la carte but only sometimes opens - apparently it was open this evening.  The menu was limitebd but we managed to pick out courses we thought sounded good.  Our waiter asked if we’d like to order drinks, we said we’d have a drink before ordering wine so i asked for a Kir Royal, the waiter didn’t know what this was which surprised me as we were in a five star establishment . He asked me to describe what it was, so i did but he still didn’t know, i told him it was champagne with cassis but he said he had prosecco and hadn’t heard of cassis. he eventually went off and did come back with a prosecco and cassis which i was happy enough with.   The wine list was ok although didn’t have a huge variety, we had seen bottles displayed outside of one of our favorite spanish wines but this was not on the menu. we went for a reasonably priced  Montepuluciano , there was nothing special about it unfortunately but that’s a chance you take , there are some really good varieties of this wine but i didn’t feel this one was one of those.   strangely our waiter filled our glasses right to the top of our glasses!!! a complete no no and a real pet hate of mine, i would not have expected to get that there let alone most restaurants!  thank god it wasn’t a very expensive wine or it would have killed me! Food wise i went for a crab starter that was pretty unspectacular, i was was sorry i hadn’t picked the pork belly starter that my husband had, that was quite tasty. main course i went for the fillet steak and he went for the duck, my fillet was tasty but cut in half which i thought was odd and came with one large chip potato and a tiny baby carrot and nothing else!! my husbands duck was not rested for long enough and you could tell as the blood was running out of it ( my husband was once a chef so knows this) . Both our desserts were disappointing too ( honestly we are normally not that fussy) but they really weren’t great. i had a tiramisu which was sort of deconstructed but the pieces of biscuit that surrounded it tasted stale and well it was just frankly not nice. it was the friday night after valentines so maybe that played a factor but they certainly didn’t look rushed off their feet. We went up and sat in the foyer after dinner and ordered drinks, but it took a half an hour and nothing arrived so we asked again and again they took a long time to come, we put it down to the fact that we weren’t sitting near enough to the bar but even at that it really shouldn’t matter, again the staff at the bar said there was delays due to it being the night after valentines. Overall a lovely hotel and we had a great stay but the restaurant was not to five star standard. i will however say that the breakfast the next day was the best i’ve ever eaten at a hotel, really really tasty , eggs were perfect and so was everything else. a huge variety of everything at the buffet and the cooked breakfast was delicious too. staff at breakfast very friendly.",5,2019,02,19
217,5 Star,"We Are just home from a Fabulous Stay At The Powerscourt.
From Start to Finish the service was excellent as we checked in we were trilled to hear our room had been upgraded to a Mountain View Of the Sugarloaf. Greta the Young Lady looking after Us at Reception was so helpful and friendly excellent Customer Service Professional and Welcoming we really Enjoyed our stay the Hotel is Beautiful and we look forward to our Return 5 Star Service ",5,2019,02,19
217,Wonderful Experience,"Stayed January 2019. Check in was very efficient and helpful. Lovely room overlooking gardens and Sugarloaf Mountain.

217,Not impressed ,"It’s our first wedding anniversary ! So as a gift my husband booked us into Powerscourt .firstly our room was not ready  at check in which was first 3 o’clock then changed to 4  o’clock we had over a two hour wait  we waited in the bar mc gills and were told we could get a call no call after a hour so I rang to be put on hold 3 people on reception  put me on hold times ,still none the wiser we where told we again would get a call back which never happened ! ( got to our room
At 6 o clock ) We had also tried to book the sika and were told it was full for the night understand we had not pre booked so that was ok . When in mc gills the manage I think he was was lovely cocktails old fashioned top class any way we got talking to him he got our room sorted and brought us directly to it also brought us chocolates for our anniversary (lovely touch) . He also got us in to the sika for dinner ! We went to the sika nice food we were a tad surprised that it was nearly empty plenty of tables available ! Things were on the up until the next morning ordered 2 soft boiled eggs for breakfast after 20 mins still no eggs the lady at the table across from me ordered eggs 5 mins later got her breakfast , mean while I was still waiting after calling the staff several times I eventually got my breakfast ! It this stage my blood was boiling after my hard very hard boiled eggs came out which at this point I didn’t even bother to send back ,I went to complain at front desk ! They added a flimsy extra hour at check out ! My husband when paying the bill complained to the manager gave us a few drinks off bill ( no apologies actually said they made several calls to both of our phones and we had not picked up and that our room was ready at 4 o’clock lies lies lies ) as we as I mentioned above were waiting in the bar for them to call us ! Horrible horrible experience ! ! Hotel it self is lovely pity about  the service ! We had ask for someone to get back to us after the complaint on the morning we left but as this never happened I am writing this review !  Disappointed very disappointed ",1,2019,02,17
217,Worst experience ,"This is my first time posting, it's long I know but for good reasons..

My husband and I stayed for two nights at this hotel, it was the worst experience at a hotel not to mention a supposedly 5 star hotel, the staff are appalling. On our way back from a walk around the grounds we phoned the sugar loaf lounge to make a reservation for afternoon tea, when we finally after 3 attempts (the phone was hung up on 3 times) got through to restaurant reservations I was told due to a busy day at the hotel they were taking no bookings but If i walked in I might be accommodated, when we got there the lounge was busy but not full by no means we asked for a table and a young waitress was showing us to one when a male waiter stopped her and said no we have no table for these people, to my immediate eye I could see 4 tables empty, my husband said why not, to which the male waiter replied you have no reservation, we said we tried to make one but we're told ye were taking none, and my husband said so why is there tables reserved then, I immediately tried to say we were guests at the hotel as I thought maybe he was keeping them for guest , his response was appalling and shocking to treat a person the way he did , he clearing thought I was going to argue with him but I was merely pointing out we were guest his reaction was extremely defensive even the young female waitress went red faced, "" I am not denying mam that we have taken reservations I am not denying this but we have no table for ye "" he was loud and aggressive  I walked away immediately as I'm not confrontational and went straight to the lift to get to my room crying i was so shocked, his behaviour towards a woman was simply disgusting and embarrassing, when I returned from my room to join by husband for a drink In the outer lobby, the male waiter had realised we were guest and was watching us a very uncomfortable situation I saw him approaching us and said i  ""Might"" have a table if we still wanted it at which point I refused, it's funny though because he showed two couples to tables approx 10 to 15 mins after us whom also had no reservations with no hesitation, he clearly is high on what little power he has within the establishment. If he was a meme Et of my staff I would really rethink my judgement. 

Also When we checked In we had paid by visa debit which we have done in many many Marriott hotels around the world, but at the powerscourt because we did it meant that we could not charge anything to our room which was not mentioned or outlined to us on checkin, thus caused a lot of issues for the seriously under qualified staff, on the first morning I ordered toast to my room again after many attempts I had to call concierge who had to place my order for me as the restaurant would not answer, when It arrived by a young waitress she walked into my room and said ""can I get payment by card or cash straight away please I couldn't charge  to your room"" we were confused but said nothing, I asked how much was the bill she replied ""it's less then €20"" i could not believe my ears she came up with a basket of toast no plate nor a knife to butter the toast with we had to use a spoon and asked for money on a bill she didn't even have the correct amount for, we gave her the €20 and she left I simply found it puzzling. 

The water when we filled the bath was a terrible colour I have pictures to proof it, we ate at Sika on one night the food was good and the staff there were at least polite, we got a side of mash it was cold we had to ask to heat it up which they did with nonissue thankfully as my heart was pounding incase they made a scene. 

After dinner We came up to the sugar loaf lounge again for drinks thankfully I had reserved a table because they would ostracize  you otherwise, I was greeted by girl that said yes we have two bills here from you, that you charged to your room (from the previous night ) and you are not on our system, what's your name I told her and I said try it without the O, her response was so your name isn't O Connor I said yes it is but at one point I saw it down as just Connor she still couldn't find me , I said well I am definitely staying here at which point she continued to ask how I had paid for my room I told her visa debit, again the situation was embarrassing and uncomfortable all she needed to do was communicated with reception across the hall to clarify the situation. 
To say I was disappointed is an understatement my husband had traveled from overseas to spend a nice relaxing weekend together but instead we were treated with horrible hostility and with disrespect from staff, I will never return to this hotel it was my first and last time, it was an experience to say the least. I had my bags packed and ready to leave at 8.30 am on the morning of check out, and the best part about the whole weekend was sitting into my car to leave. 
I do not wish to receive a response from this hotel defending there behaviour and treatment towards us, as I'm sure it is their culture to do so it was evident while there, trust me I  am not exaggerating, please save your hard earned money and go someplace it's appreciated and you are treated kindly.

217,Perfect place to relax,"Staff were very friendly and welcoming, food in Sika restaurant was lovely, buffet breakfast had plenty on offer. Espa spa was just what we needed to relax. Would highly recommend and the nearby powerscourt gardens topped off a great stay! Will come again!",5,2019,02,16
217,Visit as a birthday present,"And it really was the best present! Nice experience from the entrance to the all the exits inside/ outside. Maike's smile so comforting! Reception all staff very welcoming. Housekeeping - spotless clean! Ionela such a nice girl, help with all our needs during our stay. Rooms are big and comfy.  Lunch/ Dining/ Breakfast - 5* - Diana lovely girl and very helpful  advise us on allergies. Overall a lovely experience and we look forward to go back! ",5,2019,02,16
217,Excellent - One small issue,"Stayed this past week on a trip to the Dublin area.  Property is located in the countryside, but is not very far from the city.  Grounds are beautiful and would recommend the falls and riverwalk trail.  Check-in was quick, friendly and professional.  Room was upgraded and was awesome.  Bed was one of the best we have slept in while traveling (we travel for work ans leisure quite a bit)  Breakfast was very good with many options available for all tastes.  Only issue we experienced is on our last night, the wife ran the tub and the water was rust colored coming from the faucet.  We let the water run for a while and the discolored water did not go away.  We did not report this as it was 10PM and we left for the airport the next morning at 5:45AM.  Not sure if work was done or we just had bad luck?  Overall, annoying, but did not detract from our stay.",5,2019,02,14
217,Beautiful Hotel - Very serene,"Although it is only in the category of the Autograph Collection, the hotel's standards are much higher.  Beautiful property with great ambiance.  Nice place to recharge and just relax yet it is so close to Dublin.  There are limited options for meals - either the formal restaurant or the pub.  We ate at the pub and it was pretty good but not amazing.  Rooms were very nice and large.  Great place to go for long walks and enjoy nature.  The garden centre with an AVOCA branch for shopping or grabbing a tea and dessert is very quaint.  Highly recommend it.  The only downside is that it is a bit touristy.  ",5,2019,02,14
217,Charge the batteries,"The trip began with some of the local attractions, a trip to Powerscourt waterfall, followed by a walk through the tranquil Powerscourt gardens (highly recommended). We collected our rooms keys after checking in online, great service allowing us to even check in early without any fuss!
The room was sensational, clean, with all amenities within grasp with no needless calls to reception requesting a variety necessities. The bed was one of the most luxurious nights sleep i have ever had the pleasure of having, a highlight of a 5-star treatment. 
The pool and leisure facilities were good, a little more heat in the Jacuzzi more preferable for my tastes. A tip would be to book a Spa treatment to benefit from a more private and relaxing serenity room. Especially during busy periods as the pool can become a little overcrowded.
We then decided to opt for some food and cocktails from McGills bar. Service was swift and with attention to detail, staff very attentive, cuing my partners need for a cocktail. Asking her preferences and tastes without been prompted! We ordered burger and cod, food was average not quite up to the standards.  
We retired to the room for the evening ordering room service for a relaxing evening, again the service to the room was second-to-none! The TV had a casting function allowing us to view our Netflix's at our leisure, simply delightful!
Finally, the piece de resistance, the breakfast! We were seated for breakfast, informed any items we could not find at breakfast bar would be provided, simply ask. Arnold provided us with a fantastic service, with flat whites and eggs supplied on demand and in a timely fashion! All tastes and needs catered for without lifting a finger, fantastic! I requested to take my coffee outside to the balcony for some fresh air to witness the fantastic view offered from this hotel. 
A definite highlight of the trip!
I would highly recommend this hotel and will be staying again in the future.",4,2019,02,12
217,5 star experience,"We stayed here for 2 nights in a superior king room and it did not disappoint. The room had a large lounge area with couches and tv, sleeping area with another large tv and a work station. The bathroom was beautiful! 

One night we dined in McGills. This was much more casual than we expected and had a countryside pub vibe. The casual vibe in this pub was unexpected in a 5 star hotel setting. However, pub food was delicious.

On the second night, we booked into Sika restaurant which was amazing! I would highly recommend going here for dinner and make sure you book in advance to get a suitable time. 

On both nights we had a few drinks in the Sugar Loaf lounge. However, both nights the service was disappointing and very slow (on a couple of occasions we had to go to the front desk to order a drink). The first night we were told to wait 30 minutes for a G&T even though it wasn’t busy. On the second night, we had been ordering wine with dinner in Sika which is not served in the lounge. When asked if possible to order this wine, we were told go down to Sika and order if we want. Given this is a 5 star, I would have expected staff to be able to get drinks from Sika for hotel guests if ordered rather than be told to go get it myself. The restaurant/pub/lounge area felt very segregated and didn’t feel like it fell under the one hotel. 

We booked into the spa for 2 full body massages which were very relaxing. The spa facilities were super clean, spacious and relaxing. The pool had a very chilled vibe which was great with a jacuzzi. Children are only left enter between 9-11 and 4-6. 

Overall, I would highly recommend this hotel - I would expect better service upon our return. ",5,2019,02,11
217,Powerscourt Hotel in Ireland,"You would be foolish not to stay here if you're looking to explore Ireland.  100% a 5 star value hotel for less than half the price!  The service was over the top, the food was Devine, tea time was fun, there is a pub on site, stunning spa, massive conference room, and gorgeous famous gardens on site.  The hotel will offer a ride into town and even schedule a drive into Dublin.  I recommend grabbing a bike and exploring the property.  There is tons to see around the hotel aside from Dublin.",5,2019,02,02
217,"Romantic night away close to Dublin, but not IN Dublin","Myself and my husband wanted to get away, somewhere close to Dublin, but somewhere luxurious- (A break from two young kids at home). And we certainly weren't disappointed with Powerscourt.  The entrance to the hotel is fabulous, our bedroom was huge, the pool area was perfect and the food was second to none. Kevin, our waiter in Sika and Valdas, who parked our car and got our car again when we were leaving, both went out of their way to make our stay more enjoyable. I would have no hesitation in recommending this hotel and would love to be going back. It's pricey, but with the River Dargle and all the beautiful walks at your doorstep too, it was worth it.",5,2019,01,30
217,Our Dream Wedding at Powerscourt Hotel Autograph Collection 01/19/2019,"I cannot explain how wonderful this hotel is. From the moment we arrived until we left, everyone and everything was perfect! I have stayed at a lot of 5 Star hotels but Powerscourt is in a league of their own!

The staff at Powerscourt are the best ever! The work culture is so amazing! They were always willing and able to provide us with anything we needed! I would like to recognize the entire staff and management! Housekeeping, food, wedding planning, transportation and management were amazing! We jot to know Silvana, Steven in the Pub, Cedric, Tatu and Alma along with the others. They are the face of Powerscourt and are all experts at their crafts. 

Our wedding was amazing. We married outside on the greens with beautiful sugarloaf mountain in the background. The staff made sure we felt like royalty on our special day. I cannot thank them enough!

The food is AMAZING! The drinks are AMAZING! The people are AMAZING!

We cannot wait to return to Powerscourt!

217,Another Great Stay,"Returned to the stunning Powerscourt Hotel over the New year to celebrate a special occasion. We had a beautiful family room to accommodate my husband and I and two teenagers.
The hotel was looking splendid with stunning Christmas decorations throughout and a fantastic atmosphere .  Everything was truly perfect during our stay, we especially enjoyed our dinner in the relaxed atmosphere of McGills Bar, a special thanks to Ian for his excellent service and pleasant conversation during the evening.

Also a very special mention to Robbie, the Concierge for all his assistance in helping to make this a memorable stay and going the extra mile with great humour, thank you
Robbie, we really appreciate it

217,Saturday night stay at a stunning location.,"I love this hotel, it’s surrounded by the stunning scenery in Wicklow. We arrived early and had a lovely lunch before checking in. 

There was a mix up with the rooms but the European porter was really helpful in getting it all sorted for us. Reception had assigned us to rooms above the pricing for which we had booked. Once we checked with the desk, we were re-assigned our correct booking. 

The food is superb and the hotel is beautifully designed. Staff are extremely helpful and friendly.

The hotel is very clean. There are a few updates needed such as the carpets and towels/bath robes are starting to wear thin from washing/use. And the electric plug on the desk in our room was loose and didn’t work. Toilet seat was also very loose in the gym. A few minor upgrades needed to keep the place fresh. 

Overall a really enjoyable experience. Stunning, whether it’s teeming with rain or the sun is splitting the stones.

217,Stephen- Front of House ,"I recently stayed here for my friends birthday, the service from start to finish was superb! Stephen was exceptional and really stood out. He brought us to nearby Emelias Restaurant (Italian) in the courtesy car provided by the hotel. He made a really big effort and made us feel very welcome. Breakfast was fantastic and such a selection. The suite rooms were amazing 😍.... we will all certainly be back! Thanks again for all your hard work!

We visited this weekend. What a lovely stay! We were greeted by Nermina at breakfast and she was so helpful and friendly. She assisted us with booking meals and advising us of things to do.

217,ONE OF THE BEST HOTELS I HAVE EVER STAYED IN,"Usually, I never write any feedback about the places I have been to but this time I want to thank all people who work in Powerscourt Hotel and especially I want to say a special thanks to Julij'a who works in ""Sika Restaurant"" for her professional and personal service, care and attention in looking after us.   My husband was celebrating his 70th Birthday and Julij'a certainly made it a very memorable one.  Again thanks Julij'a.
Cant wait to go back to this hotel again.",5,2019,01,25
217,Fabulous,"My husband and I are just back from spending 2 nights at this hotel. What an experience, we both loved everything about it. The atmosphere is really good and the staff are so warm and friendly. Our room was beautiful, so much space and so comfortable. This hotel is everything you would expect from a 5 star property. I had a pamper package, a treat for my birthday, the staff in the Spa were fantastic, I had the most amazing massage. Lunch was included and because it was my birthday they brought me a plate of lovely chocolates this I thought was a lovely touch. I honestly can't wait to go back. Also my husband loved the walks in the estate. Overall a most relaxing experience.",5,2019,01,24

217,Above and beyond,"We have just returned from a wonderful stay at the hotel to celebrate my husbands birthday.  As soon as we arrived we felt special, the staff were lovely and  upon checkin we were upgraded to a suite.  A lovely extra for a special weekend.  
The room was fantastic and huge!  We chilled out in the bar watching the match and then headed to the pool and spa - Fabulous and so relaxing. 
At dinner we were surprised with a complementary bottle of Prosecco.  They really went above and beyond to make our short visit extra special.
Food was delicious, loved the halibut, and of course the chocolate bomb 🤗. 
Overall a wonderful experience, staff were exceptional and we will definitely be back. 
Thank you to all in Powerscourt for a great visit.",5,2019,01,22

We had a slight issue but Jose went above and beyond to ensure my parents had the most wondering of times for this special occasion. I was a little hard on Jose but how he conducted himself was top class!!! He made sure my parents were totally looked after for the rest of the trip so thank you very much for that Sir!!.

217,Excellent customer service,"I stayed at the Powerscourt just for one night to celebrate my birthday with my husband and I must say it was the best experience ever.
We both used to work over the years in hospitality industry and we always pay attention to details in customer service.
First we were kindly welcomed by Reception. In the beginning they couldn't find our reservation, but, with no stress and smile on the faces, they got everything sorted.

Firstly we ordered Room Service -  it was surprisingly quick and a waiter was professional. After that we had a drink in the lounge, which was also very nice, but dinner was absolutely - AMAZING. Very very very nice staff, delicious food for reasonable price and excellent customer service. It was busy that night, but we were not left out. 
Breakfast - a little bit busy, but steady and good planned. Various options for everyone in buffet.

If you want to be treated like in real 5* hotel, choose Powerscourt.

Special thank you to Stephen and Rebecca in McGills Bar. Outstanding service and very friendly 

Also the lovely Christine in Espa who did a wonderful full body massage on myself. And Lola who was my husband's therapist was equally nice.

We were upgraded to a suite and it was magnificent. Food was delicious at breakfast. Food in McGills was also very tasty.

The meal in Sika was quite fine dining but very tasty.

Thanks for a wonderful stay. We hope to come back.",5,2019,01,20

217,Amazing hotel,"Stayed here for one night before Xmas, we arrived early and room was available which was great! :) Gym is really good, pool and spa facilities were lovely and relaxing. Rooms were amazing!!! Breakfast was fab, overall such an enjoyable experience!",5,2019,01,16
217,AMAZING HOTEL,"There is not a single thing i could fault with this hotel, 5 star in every way, Amazing staff, all happy to help. Beautiful tasteful decor , we will definitely be back.(Do not come if you are on a diet, the food is to die for)",5,2019,01,16
217,Sugar Loaf Lounge,"Myself and two friends had afternoon tea. It was 5 star treatment. Friendly staff, no request was too much. The ambiance was calm and relaxed. The quality ingredients used  was delicious. Highly recommend.",5,2019,01,15
217,Can’t Wait to return,"Me & my friend traveled to Powerscourt for one night for a long overdue girls night away.
From the time we arrived we we’re blown away,I have never met such lovely, genuine staff from the concierge,the girls on reception,the staff in the bar we’re fantastic.
We got up graded to a suite and could not fault a singe thing,the room was amazing, the food in the bar and breakfast the next morning was fab.
Can’t wait to return",5,2019,01,13
217,Disgusting bathroom,Came back to the room and all the taps were on and the water was black with dirt! Hotel reception still thought that €470 was a fair price for that. Came for my dads birthday. 5 star prices and 1 star experience. Very disappointed. Will never come back again.,1,2019,01,13
217,Amazing and stunning!,"Stayed here for three nights with the family and we all enjoyed it from start to finish. Sugar loaf lounge was a great afternoon tea experience and the food in sika was great. Special mention to Kevin. All the usual endless Fayre for breakfast too! The kids loved the pool.

The only negative we’re miserable other guests not joining in the great atmosphere and wanting to sit in front of the fire with nobody else around! This is a busy hotel because of Christmas and the staff were engaging and great. Don’t understand why some people come away to be miserable!

That said we had a great time and have booked again for a New Year break.",5,2019,01,12
217,Lovely Grounds and Spa but Staff Hit and Miss,"I checked in with my mother on Saturday 5th January for a two night stay in Powerscourt. It was a present for her for Christmas and so I had arranged dinner reservations and a spa treatment for both of us in advance. Upon checking in the receptionist was very nice and even upgraded us to a suite after asking if we wanted two double beds. We confirmed our dinner and spa reservations and then went to our room to get settled. It was still early afternoon so we decided to go to The Sugar Loaf lounge for a drink and a bite to eat. Here our server was lovely and very attentive as all the staff in here seemed to be. We decided to book for Afternoon Tea for the following day which was no issue. The real problem began when we went down for our reservation in Sika Restaurant at 6:30. The restaurant was quiet, having just opened and we were seated quickly. Our server was pleasant throughout but the food was not the standard we were expecting but was passable. Once dessert was finished and we were ready to pay the bill, we couldn't get the attention of any server. It was about 30 minutes before we managed to get the attention of the host, who really wasn't that pleasant but returned promptly with the bill. Our meal was included in the price of the package I booked so we just had to pay for the drinks we ordered. Rather than risk waiting another 30 mins for someone to approach we went up to the Host to pay. He was quite rude, not asking if we enjoyed the meal or making any conversation - even when we left a tip (which we nearly regretted doing afterwards). Very disappointing. 

Breakfast the next morning was fine, with the same host on duty and no friendlier unfortunately. The highlight was attending the spa later on. Both therapists were extremely friendly and welcoming and the treatments were brilliant and all of the staff members we encountered were very friendly. Afternoon tea was also a lovely experience and again, we could not fault the staff in The Sugar Loaf. However, unfortunately that evening my mother came down with a migraine and we decided the best thing would be to go home early as she was very unwell. We packed up our bags and I went to reception to check us out. Only one member of staff was on reception at this time with a queue of 3 or 4 people. The man in front of me actually left the queue because he was waiting so long. Eventually another member of staff came over and called me over to the desk. I explained that I was checking out and we had to unfortunately leave early. Not once did he show any care or concern about why we had to leave early, or ask how our stay was. All he asked for was the payment which was absolutely disgraceful. Not the service you expect from a 5 star hotel. Very rude and was the final straw for us really. I definitely will not be returning or recommending it to anyone. I spent a lot of money on the weekend and don't feel that the service we received reflected it which is such a pity. Certain staff members are so rude that they let the others down who show the care and attention they should. Not worth the money and will look elsewhere next time I'm booking a short trip like this.

217,Magical - One of Our Favorite Hotels!,"This was the perfect ending to our 2 week stay in Ireland this summer.  This is one of the most decadent, unique, beautifully and elegantly decorated and managed hotels we have ever stayed at - and we travel a lot. There were so many personal touches from both the staff and the amenities (even the complimentary bedroom slippers were so plush!) that we fell in love with this hotel. When we arrived, we had already been upgraded to a suite (my husband is platinum). The suite was huge, well appointed and even had a room just for our luggage and a TV built into the bathroom vanity mirror. The bathroom was stunning with brown and white hand cut marble. Our college age daughter, who also travels a lot, was so enamored with the suite, she was busy taking pictures and videos of it, from the minute we walked in.  We had breakfast in the restaurant which has a wonderful buffet including crème fraiche and smoked salmon parfaits, amazing muffins (we don’t normally get excited about muffins but these were truly amazing) and fresh honey from a bee hive.  The grounds and the views are also beautiful. It was the perfect stay!",5,2019,01,07
217,"Great, but room for improvement","Second stay here & the hotel is fabulous! The rooms are large and spacious, a bit old fashioned in taste. The lobby is impressive and the food is fab. Breakfast selection is great. Prices of coffee in the bar are unjustifiably expensive, so knocked a couple of stars off. No need to overprice on something that barely costs a few cents. Also staff at reception can be more friendly!",3,2019,01,07
217,Post Xmas break ,"5 star building and surrounds.  Inside I can't say it's 5 star.  Arrived early for check-in which is at 4pm.  Concierge/baggage people were very friendly and held onto our luggage while we waited for our room.  At check-in we were informed we would get a call to my mobile when the room was ready.  4pm is ridiculously late for check-in but we knew that when we booked.  Went for a walk and returned to the hotel at 4.20pm (still had not received a call to inform us the room was ready)  went to check-in and received the room card.  Later we tried to have food in McGills bar but it was busier than Templebar on a Saturday night.  Went to the restauraunt to be told we'd have to wait 20 minutes, the lobby was packed with people in the same position.  We left and went to nearby Enniskerry for dinner.  Overall was disappointed with some but not all of the staff.  It appears the hotel was under pressure with the numbers staying.  I paid 5 star prices and was let down, never again.  ",3,2019,01,06
217,Stunning venue pulls score up to a 3 - but not 5 star service,"Stayed at the hotel for a quick break from the city after the New Year rush and loved the location and the room (see pics), but... 

The hotel is beautiful and the surroundings are spectacular, BUT, the hotel is also enormous and the scale of it perhaps contributes to some of the problems we had. 

Firstly, it looked like the hotel was full, meaning that the lobby area was jam-packed all the time, requests to front desk / housekeeping were missed and the restaurants were unable to cope. 

The point about the restaurants led to two extremes of dissatisfaction: either there were queues for breakfast or there were diners being turned away from a half empty restaurant at dinner. Neither of which is impressive from a five-star hotel especially when the venue knows how many guests they have booked in. 

I completely understand that you may need a dinner reservation, (although perhaps something to be pointed out when checking in???), so I'm not complaining about being turned away, but I do think it could have been handled better. 

We were disappointed—when gazing at a half-empty Sika, the in-house restaurant—a little before 8pm to be told, brusquely: ""We might fit you in at 9:15"". I think the mâitre-d' may have been a little busy, but a simple apology, or something along the lines of: ""Unfortunately, although it looks like we have tables, the kitchen is a little busy. Why not have a drink at the bar and I'll let you know if something comes up sooner"", may have worked a bit better than what was said and how it was said. Five star restaurants tend to offer such diplomatic gestures rather than the flippant manner in which this was handled. Never mind, we had a great meal at Johnnie Fox's instead. (See review). 

Last couple of whinges: 

1, Like many top-class hotels, the hotel offers a turndown service but it is not automatic, it is one that you actively have to opt-in to by calling 8551 and requesting it (see card in picture). So when you actually have to specifically request it, we were surprised to return from Johnnie Fox's to find it hadn't happened. 

2. The queues for breakfast were RIDICULOUS and the decision to open one of the functions rooms as overspill was a great idea, BUT could have been handled better. If the hotel has the overspill as a contingency plan and knows how many guests they had staying, they could have avoided the queues happening in the first place: automatically re-directing people or making people aware of the potential of it at reception when checking in sounds like a better plan, rather than p-ing people off and making something simple into a drama, which is what happened. (Incidentally - a note to hotel staff: put the pre-printed flag announcing the overspill and redirecting diners outside of Sika so the people who are queuing can see it rather than outside the overspill itself where it is no use...)  

3. Once in the overspill, the poor staff were clearly rushed off their feet: you actively had to track them down and grab them to order coffee or something from the menu and you had to experience things like the pepper pot on the table (see pic) not only empty but without a stopper. 

This is a tiny thing but five star hotels take care of the tiny things without flinching. 

Look, in and of themselves, none of these things—the pepper pot, the queues, the flippancy at Sika, the forgotten turndown service etc.—are major things, and taken in isolation, we probably would have forgotten. But they all add up and they add up to a lack of attention to detail that you would expect from a five star hotel. 

That said, the breakfast WAS delicious, the staff were, by-and-large, friendly and the room and the view were stunning, but without those things, the score could easily have been a one or a two.  Maybe we were just unlucky and that justifies the three score.",3,2019,01,05
217,"Upgrade, Magical location, Helpful Staff and Relaxing Services","Arrival

We've made this an annual tradition to spend the last weekend of the Christmas holidays at Powerscourt and it doesn't disappoint. Upon arrival we were upgraded and also one room was moved to a mountain view, which was available when booking (which was great!) Staff remembered that I was a Marriott member which is good to see. 

Food 

Delicious in-room dining. I'd like to see a few more healthier keto/low carb options (perhaps make omelettes an all-day option?) as this is the way the world is moving now but their salmon was a good reliable. The breakfast has many options and a wonderful view. 

Room

Very comfortable beds and hugely spacious room with 3 TVs, walk-in wardrobe and separate living room. 

Staff

The ice machine on the 4th floor and the 6th floor were out of order and one of the staff was very observant and noticed me walking around looking for ice and filled my bucket up for rme.

ESPA

Wonderful facilities. I enjoyed a back massage and facial. Probably the best hotel spa in Wicklow and/or Leinster.",5,2019,01,03
217,A very merry Christmas!,Stayed again this year and things have just got better and better. The food and staff are amazing and the gingerbread full scale hotel was truly something to see. Well done everyone at Powerscourt for making my family Christmas just the best,5,2018,12,31
217,Beautiful location,Stayed here a few years ago and decided to try it again for Christmas 🎄 It’s in a beautiful location anytime of the year. The staff were very pleasant and helpful. We had booked a room and were upgraded to a suite at no extra charge. The suite was lovely with the windows looking on to a garden. We had dinner 🥘 in the restaurant on the day we arrived it was lovely and very well presented. Breakfast was a buffet which was presented well. Lunch was a buffet it was well presented. There was no entertainment in the evening. Do not think that I would go back at Christmas 🎄 again but I would stay here again.,4,2018,12,28
217,Wonderful Stay!,"My husband and I had such a treat staying here on a last minute trip to Ireland right before Christmas. The common spaces were gorgeous and beautifully decorated for the holidays. We loved the meal we had at Sika and afternoon tea at Sugarloaf lounge. We were able to use SPG suite night awards to upgrade to a suite - it was huge and super comfortable with a separate bedroom and living room areas, walk-in in closets, 1.5 bathrooms and an outdoor terrace with a pretty view of garden and mountain. There’s a buffet breakfast at Sika that we chose as our SPG Platinum reward instead of points and it was wonderful. All of the staff throughout the hotel and restaurants were friendly and attentive and helped us have a very enjoyable stay. Highly recommend! ",5,2018,12,27
217,The perfect break before Christmas ,"My sister and I recently booked a last minute getaway to the Powerscourt Hotel as a preChristmas treat! Only living in Dublin, it’s a regular spot for us to frequent for lunch or the occasional spa trip. 

Upon stepping into the hotel, the Christmas spirit took over and I instantly felt at home! The hotel was decorated in such a beautiful, elegant way that was sure to fill any customer with the feeling of Christmas! Niamh, who checked us in, was incredibly helpful. She made the whole experience easy and quick.

Our first stop was the Sugar Loaf Lounge for lunch and as usual, it was delicious! I was also very impressed with how they catered for my sister, who is a coeliac.

We then checked into our room and it was just beautiful! The regal feel to the room made us feel like we were celebrities and it was the perfect setting for our relaxing one night stay. 

Our next stop was the spa. We both received aromatherapy massages from Sarah and Magdalena and they were fantastic! It’s the second time we’ve opted for this massage and it won’t be our last! The spa facilities were fantastic and we thoroughly enjoyed the steam room facilities. 

That evening, we dined at the Sika restaurant and as usual, it was outstanding! The service, the food and the atmosphere was lovely.

The following morning we dined for breakfast and I’m always blown away by the extensive range of food available. It was delicious and really set us up for the day. 

All in all, Powerscourt is my favourite hotel in Ireland to visit and it is very dear to me and my family. I can’t wait to return in the near future for another relaxing break. ⭐️⭐️⭐️⭐️⭐️",5,2018,12,26
217,Drinks,"Came into Powerscourt last night for a few drinks. We first visited McGills pub where all the staff were very professional and attentive. Ian behind the bar dropped the drinks over to the table which was a very nice touch. After a few drinks in McGills we headed up to sugarloaf where the staff were excellent. Owen and Keith provided top notch service and cracking pints, would defiantly return again for the service alone!",5,2018,12,20
217,Christmas party overnight,Another wonderful stay in Powerscourt for the annual Christmas party. Rooms lovely - although I'm disappointed that they have stopped using ESPA toiletries. Availed of treatments in ESPA which was amazing as usual. Dinner was delicious. Staff all wonderful with a special mention for the Doorman on duty at 1400 on the 15th Dec (really sorry I can't remember his name - lovely lovely man) and Kim in ESPA for their special kindness and excellent customer service. The Christmas decorations in the hotel are fabulous- especially the Gingerbread Hotel in the lobby. It is the perfect hotel to visit to get into the Festive spirit.,5,2018,12,20
217,Fab stay !,"We Stayed for one night & got an upgrade as we checked in, we thanked the receptionist Sofia as it was my birthday. She wished me a happy birthday & said enjoy our stay . We couldn’t fault our stay & had a lovely meal in Mc Gills . Our room was fab & so luxurious. Breakfast was fab & would recommend this beautiful scenic hotel . When we checked out the next morning, the same receptionist was there (Sofia) , she remembered us from the previous day & asked us did we have a lovely stay & enjoy my birthday .  We thought this was so nice that she was so attentive. Will be back next year to celebrate my birthday again .",5,2018,12,19
217,Outstanding Hotel and Staff,"Strategically located in County Wicklow, this was our surprise and treasure from our recent trip to Ireland. What a jewel!

We will definitely return on a future occasion",5,2018,12,12
217,Hidden Gem,We have a lovely overnight stay at the powerscourt hotel. The staff were so professional and friendly. Our room was exceptional with beautiful views of the mountains. I would highly recommend a stay in this hotel if you are visiting Powerscourt House and Waterfall and just looking for a night away to relax.,5,2018,12,11
217,Fantastic stay,Stayed for one night here as a pre big birthday celebration and it was fantastic. The room was just gorgeous I had a Mountain View room and a lovely balcony and view. The staff were really nice and helpful. Overall a lovely experience and one I hope I get to do again sometime. Would highly recommend this hotel.,5,2018,12,09
217,Deja vu?,"We visited in 2013 when the hotel was part of the Ritz Carlton Brand.  When planning our visit, we wanted to show our friends this unique property and its setting in the countryside but were apprehensive after the change to the Autograph Collection.  The changes have only made the property better.  The Gordon Ramsey restaurant is gone (no loss) and in its place is Sika.  The lobby has some updates, but still keeps to a very glamorous modern vibe.  The rooms have not changed, and appear to be holding up well with a few wear and tear signs.  The grounds are beautiful, the setting picturesque, and the staff extremely helpful and friendly.",4,2018,12,06
217,Pre Christmas getaway,"My wife and I visited the hotel following a recommendation from a staff member Roisin who used to look after us when we stayed in the Summerhill hotel in enniskerry. We were blown away with out experience from start to finish the ease of booking with reservations was amazing. The welcome into the beautiful reception area was lovely. The christmas feel with lovely decoration was fantastic. The Giant replica powerscourt ginger bread house was a real showstopper.
We enjoyed the boodles afternoon tea looking over the great sugarloaf mountain. This christmas selection with champagne was very well put together and we really enjoyed this. Ross one of the managers gave us very special attention when he heard we had just got married and bought a new house. Great service and a excellent host.
Our room was fantastic the view something out of a film. The modern features such as tv built into the mirror in bathroom. Electric curtains all working so well but not impacting in the luxurious decor fitting to the hotel. We order champagne to the room and I could not believe how quick it was delivered again excellent service.
We visited the spa and enjoyed the thermal suite and pool. There was a lovely ambience to the whole area and while we did not have any treatments we plan to on our next trip.
With everything so good we had high expectations for the dinner. We love our wine ice cold and normally this is something we find difficult to have but it was no problem and wine was served perfectly. Dinner was amazing. Starters very well put together my wife had steak and I had fish. Both of us had a wonderful experience the chocolate sphere dessert was really well put together.

We finished up with a nightcap by large open fireplaces in the mainhall.
A fantastic whiskey selection I enjoyed a greenspot while my wife selected a dingle gin cocktail. I plan to enjoy the glendalough whiskey experience on my return.

This trip was by far our favourite of 2018. Thanks Roisin for the recommendation. In my opinion this is the best hotel I have every stayed in and cant wait to go back. The only regret I have is I only stayed 1
Night.

The events room was perfect for a wedding and the meal provided was to die for so if anybody wants a place for a wedding this is the place !!! The grounds and views are so breathtaking!!

217,Gorgeous location but not five star service,"I stayed here with five friends for an overnight spa break in mid October. We all arrived at different times and when I was checking in the reception was crazy busy. There were two weddings on that day and there was quite a delay checking in. The rooms were lovely but the bathrooms were a little dated. We enjoyed our treatments (massages and facials) and went to the relaxation room afterwards which was a bit messy. There were wet towels left on some of the beds...not ideal for what we were paying. There is a female only jacuzzi,sauna and spa area and the water in the jacuzzi was not very warm at all. We got ready in our bedrooms after and one had no hairdryer. These little touches were annoying for a five star property. We had drinks before dinner in the lobby and we dined in the main restaurant. The waiting staff were very friendly and the food was good. We had to get the bill amended as one speciality coffee we ordered never arrived but was still on the bill. Breakfast the next morning was also hectic. There was a queue to get in and once at the top they couldn't find our names on the list and the waiter, while I am sure he was trying to be funny, asked me did I not know my own name. I have coeliac disease and I had to ask several times for gluten free toast and it came 15 minutes after I received my breakfast. My friends could eat from the main buffet and the food was nice but it felt like a canteen it was so busy. Check out was also quite busy. The hotel emailed asking for feedback the next day and I wrote pretty much what I wrote here. I received a reply stating they would review and act on issues raised so these may not happen again. I enjoyed my stay and the hotel has fabulous grounds and some lovely staff but didn't seem to have enough staff on to cope with the number of guests.",4,2018,11,19
217,"Nermina, Lee, Ian & Sameul Take A Bow!","I called your hotel this morning to inquire about visiting for bar food etc. I was dealing with Nermina on the phone and I have to say she was the most professional, engaging and utterly professional person I have ever encountered. Later at the hotel I met Lee & Ian who served me lunch and again, the service and food was exceptional. 

I bumped into Nermina in the hotel and overall I have to say that your team there just delivered a masterclass in customer service. 10/10,

Please pass on my sincere thanks.

217,"Beautiful hotel, but not five star standard","Powerscourt estate is fabulous and there is so much to do and see in the estate. Beautiful hotel , big spacious lobby area with fabulous views. Hotel rooms are beautiful, big, spacious and a great big bathroom.More attention needs to be given to cleaning, dust and cobwebs on some of the pictures in the corridors. Staff on check - in helpful and friendly. The spa is beautiful. One of the best massages I have ever had. The masseuse was excellent at her job.
We were very disappointed with afternoon tea. Cups dirty, had to ask three times for a clean cup and had to wait 15mins for it. Shell in the crab and prawn cocktail. Scones very tasty as was the desserts. With a bit of training and a manager on duty this service could improve. Cups should be placed at the right hand side of the guest with handle pointing to 3 o 'clock. Staff in this area don't seem to care. 
 Food in the restaurant was lovely and good value for money. Great selection of wines at a good price. I had the cod which was very nice. Breakfast the next morning was excellent, one of the best breakfasts I have had. Hot and cold food very well displayed with a great selection to suit everyone.

217,Disappointing Pedicure at the Spa,"My sister, my daughter and myself visited Powerscourt Spa last July. It was a Christmas present so we were really looking forward to the day. We did have an amazing day  but we were very disappointed  with the after effects of the Pedicure. Both my sister and I had pedicures by two different therapists and both experienced a whitening of the toenails when we removed the varnish a few weeks later. Just thought I would warn other spa visitors as this has never happened before to us and we have visited a few spas in our time.
We have notified the Hotel of our experience and we were not at all happy with their response.
We won't be returning to the Espa Spa despite the wonderful day we had.",2,2018,11,14
217,Sumptuous Stay!,"I travelled here to celebrate a friend's long-standing desire to see Ireland for her birthday.  Each stop in our trip was unique and this hotel was the icing on the cake!  Thoughtful, graceful service met us at the Reception Desk with an immediate acknowledgement of my friend's special day.  The pictures of the property are an exact depiction of the facility--this is luxury!  Later, while getting ready for dinner, there was a knock at the door and the bellman brought a tray of truffles with a sweet birthday card from the front-end staff.  At the on-site restaurant she received macarons at the end of the meal.  The site is beautiful in front of Sugarloaf Mtn in the Fall colors.  Am certain it would be just as nice in the Spring.  If you think staying here would be too far from a Dublin departure, think again.  We stayed just outside the city center and it took 50 minutes to return our car.  It would have been a clear shot to the airport from here in nearly the same time. This was a jewel of a stay!!",5,2018,11,12
217,Stay away from the gluten free bread,"I cannot fault the beautiful surroundings and very efficient staff however I was dissappointed with the seafood chowder :( 

Also as a coeliac I am always dubious about gluten free bread, sometimes a restaurant will get it right however the gluten free bread I was given was more like a burger bun that was defrosted, it was dry and absolutely awful I couldn't even use it for 'dunking', coeliacs may be safer to steer clear of any gluten alternative options offered ;)",3,2018,11,11
217,Excellent spa,"Beautiful hotel in excellent location with amazing views and a super spa. Although it's a five star hotel the atmosphere is very relaxed and staff are extremely welcoming. The spa facilities are top quality ad the atmosphere is so relaxing, especially the serenity room upstairs with cosy blankets and adjustable beds and views of the mountain. We went for a few glasses of wine after in the sugar loaf lounge on the hotel, with really friendly staff, great service and more fabulous views. Was a great way to get away from it all for the day.",5,2018,11,11
217,Spectacular ,"Just visited this fantastic hotel. I must be careful I don’t run out of superlatives describing our stay. From being checked in personally by one of the extremely pleasant managers in a lovely relaxing VIP check in suite to the most incredible room. We stayed in a powescourt suite. Breathtaking, although perhaps I’d be better off not mentioning how lovely it is in fear I’ll never be able to get a reservation in the future due to excessive demand for the room. Nothing is too much trouble for the team in this hotel. We have already decided we will be returning with friends in the new year and are excited to do so. Safe to say this hotel is in the same league as Adare Manor, I can give no higher praise than that. ",5,2018,11,10
217,Amazing Unexpected Stay,"We traveled in October of 2018. We were in Kinsale and were planning on heading west to Doolin when a major storm moved into that region. We quickly canceled our Doolin reservation and booked with Powerscourt Hotel with our Marriott Rewards Points. We had no idea what a treat we were in for. The hotel's interior and grounds are gorgeous and it was a great respite during a very hectic travel schedule. They upgraded our room to a suite and it was amazing. The lovely Silvanna, at the front desk, made sure we were well taken care of during our stay. The hotel is next to Powerscourt Gardens and a short drive to Bray, Greystones and not too far to Dublin. Since it rained most of the time we were there, we did a lot of indoors things but it did not disappoint. I will definitely stay here again. ",5,2018,11,09
217,Epitome of Excellence,"This is a fantastic choice for an escape to nature & luxury. 
The building itself is gorgeous, the rooms division staff are so welcoming (Katy in reception checked us in & out and she couldn't have done a better job) , & attention to detail in the room is second to none, the bathroom and the amenities provided could not be better.

We had a minor issue in the first room that we were assigned and I requested to be moved, Angelica in reception found us another room within a matter of seconds, and Conor was at our door to move our bags within minutes, I had honestly never been treated so well before. We felt like royalty!

Food both for lunch and dinner was excellent, probably one of the best food experiences I've had to date. Everything from starters to dessert was incredibly tasty. I do must say though that some of the staff in both occasions were a little bit cold towards us, lacked friendliness and looked like they did not want to be there, but we all have bad days & that was the only downside to the whole experience. 

All in all I couldn't be happier, the hotel and everything in it is expensive, but it truly is worth spending the money on.",5,2018,11,07
217,Anniversary,"Stayed here with wife on a Saturday night. I think the hotel was a very nice hotel but I was expecting more to be honest. The food was tasty, staff were very attentative and helpful, decor is modern and clean. The pool area was nice, the spa not the same quality as the Marker spa imo. The grounds are lovely for a walk, my wife was left waiting 35mins for here breakfast ordered off the menu. Mc gills has a good atmosphere and nice for a pint. I’d return but I will probably check out another 5 star type accommodation before I’d rush back and book. But definitely one of the best hotels I’ve stayed in Ireland",4,2018,11,07
217,Memorable ,"We had the pleasure of staying here on our Marriott points and can easily say it was beyond our expectations. I travel often for work and our upgrade was unbelievable. We had a suite that made us feel like royalty.
The hotel itself is gorgeous. I took advantage of the gym area and it was well appointed. The pool is breathtaking. We had one meal in the restaurant and another at the pub, both excellent. 
We were most thankful for the staff. A finer group could not be found. They are attentive without any pretense and everyone we met was fantastic. 
We will be back. The proximity to the gardens, the waterfall and Dublin being a pleasant hour bus drive from the village make this a great place. We have not had a better experience since the Waldorf in Edinburgh. Thanks Marriott, you are a class act.",5,2018,11,04
217,Great service,"Me and the lads had a great time in the hotel on the 3rd of November. Paulina, Chris, Jason M, Shauna,Ross and niamh in sugarloaf lounge were amazing. We went to mcgills for a few drinks after and Lee, Ian, Natalie, Stephen and Becky looked after us very well. Stephen and Keith from banquets were also very good to us.",5,2018,11,03
217,Great hotel,"This was a great Marriott to book with points! Platinum Marriott member and loved this hotel. Definitely coming back. The grounds were beautiful, great to walk around and enjoy the onsite amenities. Parking was very easy. The rooms were beautiful, the suite was huge and very clean. The bed was really comfortable. The rooms are also very spread out, you could not hear anyone in the hallways or other rooms. We will definitely be back! The restaurants and bars were also very nice. It makes it easy since the property is secluded.",5,2018,10,31
217,Great stay,"We have been to Powerscourt number of times and again we well and truly enjoyed our stay. 
Positives:
- Excellent customer service and professionalism from all employees. Makes such a difference when you are greeted with a smile and all staff want to help you and make your stay enjoyable.
- Great ESPA experience. 
- Excellent dinner in SIKA restaurant. Again, quite expensive but the food is excellent and not for a moment we regretted to spend the cash. 
- Clean and large room
Negatives:
-The menu and quality of food in Sugar Loaf Lounge is quite lacking. Although the staff are very nice and there is a lot of them, we had to wait a while to get served, had to remind the waiter few times that we asked for water etc. The menu is very basic and not on the same level as the rest of the hotel experience. Definitely not worth the money spent. Need some management revamp and few new ideas. 

Overall a great weekend as usual. Expensive but money well spent. Will definitely come back (...hoping Sugar Loaf Lounge menu is improved).",4,2018,10,31
217,Amazing hotel can’t wait to return ,"Stayed in Powerscourt two months ago and all I can say is Wow! From the minute you arrive the decor and staff are just amazing. The rooms are out of this world, the nicest room I have ever stayed in! We ate in Sika, which was beautiful and the staff are very attentive to any allergies / intolerances. 
Have to mention a member of staff Valdas, he has to be one of the nicest members of staff I have come across in a hotel. He offered to help us to our room and was so genuine and pleasant. He is an asset to Powerscourt Hotel. 
So excited to return to Powerscourt Hotel. ",5,2018,10,30
217,Elegant,"This is the place to go with Marriott points.  Platinum upgrade to a suite that was like 1200 sq feet with a wrap around balcony on the top floor.  one of the nicest rooms ever (especially for the price).  1 bedroom, walk inclosed, living room dining room with desk and fireplace.  1.5 bathrooms.  Excellent staff.  Great restaurant / bar.",5,2018,10,28
217,AMAZING,"We stayed at this hotel yesterday & I did not want it to end, it was amazing! I would definitely recommend this to anyone, so rich and the scenery is surreal, photographs do not do this place justice! Also we stayed for an anniversary and we got the most amazing upgrade and chocolates, the staff where so friendly and the hotel is nothing but Luxury!",5,2018,10,25
217,Magnificent hotel in a magnificent area,"This hotel is a bit of a drive from Dublin, but, it is well worth visiting. The rooms themselves, their white marble bathrooms, the mountain view, the pool etc are all magnificent. It exudes a sense of style and opulence,  this is clearly evident in the reception area which has two large fire places. Visiting this hotel is a treat, the service is always friendly and professional. I love the attention to detail and the small stylish touches.",5,2018,10,22
217,Pure Perfection!,"The only issue I had with our stay is that is was too short.  The Powerscourt Hotel is perfection in every way including the breathtaking location, the beautifully constructed hotel and most importantly a staff that truly understands excellence in customer service and deliver it in a genuine way.  Being Marriott Platinum Elite members they could not do more to ensure we had an exceptional stay.  I would recommend this as a must on any trip to Ireland and we look forward to returning for a longer stay.  ",5,2018,10,22
217,A perfect 5-star retreat in amazing surroundings,"Powerscourt Hotel really is the perfect place to get away from everything and relax. The location is set within the beautiful Powerscourt estate with views over to the Sugar Loaf mountain and the scenery is absolutely stunning.
The hotel itself is luxurious inside and absolutely immaculate. The food is fabulous, and the spa is one of the best I've been to. The most impressive thing however, is the staff...they are really quite special. Everyone we encountered was extremely professional and friendly with an attention to customer service that was so genuine. They made the trip a truly 5-star experience and a real treat. Can't wait to go back!",5,2018,10,22
217,God’s Holiday Destination,"God comes here for holiday. And in His measure, makes certain that your experience is the same as His. From arrival to departure, the team makes you feel as the only guest, starting with a property tour that entices the senses to take part in all the resort has to offer. 

Silvana greeted us with excitement and enthusiasm to make our experience unique... special. When we tried to offer gratuity, she rejected the gesture and also hugged us both. 

Paulina created cocktails that piqued the senses; lavender, chocolate, and floral accompaniments. I couldn’t imagine imbibing to any of the ingredients alone, but her alchemy created a genius concoction that our senses had never known. 

This is the finest resort where ever stayed, and the cuisine and service are equally as unsurpassed. ",5,2018,10,21
217,What An Amazing Property,"There are very few places we've stayed that are five star in every aspect. From the welcome at the reception, to the spotless grounds, the the universally friendly and welcoming staff to the beautiful room to the marvelous breakfast, this hotel deserves every positive review it has received over the years.

The grounds are amazing, and worth a visit, even if  you're not staying here.Can't wait to return.",5,2018,10,20
217,Top of the Mountain,"As it says in the property description heading, this is former Ritz-Carlton property. And, in its transition to becoming a high-end (Autograph Collection) hotel...nothing has been lost in terms of service and amenities in making that transition. My wife and I checked into this property as Marriott Platinum Premiere Elite members and were upgraded to a spectacular ""apartment"" as an ""upgrade"". This single bedroom ""apartment"" was approximately 1500 square feet of living space with kitchen, dining room, living room, master bedroom suite, balcony, 1 1/2 baths, etc. Our room number was 212 which was on the ""low side"" of the property. The single downside of this stay was that our ""mountain view"" room did not truly have a ""view"" of Sugarloaf Mountain. My advice to anyone considering staying at this property, ensure that you request two things: (1) ask for/reserve an accommodation with a ""mountain view"" (not courtyard - pay the extra money); and, (2) ask for a room on the ""high side"" of the hotel (that will provide you with a true view of Sugarloaf Mountain). Moving in/about the hotel can be interesting as the two sides of the hotel (high side vs. low side) really have two different elevator systems that stop on different floors. This is ""quirk"" of the hotel structure, but you will work through it with no difficulty. Hotel staff could not be more friendly, helpful, accommodating, courteous, and professional. Food quality and taste is off the charts....go for the breakfast as an included cost. Bottom-line: one of the finer properties and experiences I have ever enjoyed!! Take time to enjoy the Powerscourt Gardens!  You will have no regrets. Can't wait to visit this property again. Thanks Marriott and the Powerscourt for a wonderful vacation stay! ",5,2018,10,17
217,Still amazing,"Stayed another few nights with family and friends whilst attending a wedding. The food, service and rooms are simply great and the service friendly and attentive without being starchy at all. Every convenience and service available at this wonderful resort. We will be back again!",5,2018,10,16
217,I didn't think this place could get any better,"I reguarlly stay in this Hotel and each stay gets better. I have no yet ever left a review, but after the magical weekend my family and i had... it's only right i make the effort to tel you how create my stay was and always is.. 
It never disappoints me it actually each time exceeds my expectations.  It's so lovely to see the whole Spa has been refurbished( i didn't think it could get anymore relaxing) and it's truly beautiful making it just a haven. 
Of course my spa treatments where amazing as always with such great service from the whole facility . I always feel like a VIP each time i visit and it's getting better and better. For anyone this is an experience you need to enjoy. 
It's really nice to see Powers-court invest is this facility as it really is such a beautiful place to escape too. 
Staff i just cannot say enough about, so kind, so helpful, sooo professional and make you feel really at home. I have already booked my next weekend and i cannot wait to feel the world of escape . Thank you so much for a lovely weekend",5,2018,10,15
217,Very beautiful hotel that will take your breath away!,"We did a two week driving tour of Ireland on our own, and the travel agent who booked our trip hotels was able to get Powerscourt for our first two days of the trip. It was spectacular--literally one of the finest hotels we've ever stayed in. The hotel and grounds are beautiful, with a huge garden that has interesting sculptures (look for the huge paper airplane and the reflecting globe art pieces) and also has smaller gardens around its perimeter, so every window has a great view. The darkened pool off the full-service spa is gorgeous, and has Swarovski crystal lights illuminating the bottom. The staff cuts no corners in this posh hotel, and they have fresh flowers decorating the immense lobby every day. We had a grand Irish breakfast each morning, and even dressed up a bit for it as the staff is in formal black and white attire. There is a view of Sugarloaf Mountain from the gardens, and the historic Powerscourt Estate is just a short walk from the hotel. I hope to get the chance to visit this luxurious hotel again in the future. Highly recommended.",5,2018,10,14
217,Very Nice hotel pity about the spa,"I stayed here with my husband for one night to mark a big birthday. The grounds are beautiful, the foyer was beautiful and our room was very traditional but really nice. After shopping and a stroll. We treated ourselves to a snack and drink in the cafe at the foyer. Service/ food/ drinks were all top notch. Had a swim in the pool. It was ok. Steam room wasn’t working.  Dinner later on was fabulous and really good value at €55.  We were really looking forward to treatments in the morning followed by a few hours in the spa.  We both had a massage. My husband said his was great. Mine was fine. Then for the spa. What a disappointment- it’s separate facilities for men and women- so much for a few hours together. The hot tub wasn’t that hot and there was only one jet which was at the bottom of the entrance steps so anyone using the jet had to step away anytime anyone else wanted to enter the pool. The sauna didn’t work. Overall it felt dark and dingy rather than tranquil. It turns out the men’s facilities were equally small and disappointing. I doubt we spent an hour there. This was an expensive night for us and everything was lovely but the spa. It was 3 star at best in my opinion. Instead of relaxing I found it quite stressful because I really felt ripped off and disappointed.",3,2018,10,14
217,Luxury Hotel set in a scenic Country Estate,"This was our first trip to Ireland and we wanted to travel around so we wanted to look for somewhere fairly central and close to Dublin as this was going to be the port of entry for our flight.

Finding the hotel was not too difficult, the first part was just following the ring around Dublin from the airport. Once we got closer we needed to pay a little more attention but found the property quite easily following the signage provided to the Powerscourt Estate. Entering the property through the stone gates and past security it was a short drive to the hotel along the road through the historic estate grounds to our luxury five star hotels. 

When we arrived we were a little earlier than we had planned, so our room was not ready, but we waited in the 
Sugar Loaf Lounge and had some light refreshments while we waited. Unfortunately the room took longer than we were initially informed so after have something to drink and light to eat we decided to do a little local sight seeing. 

Our wait was worth it, our Room 549, was a very nice suite that had a garden view, large bathroom, walk in closet area, separate living room with TV and a nice separate bedroom. The property had formerly been a Ritz-Carlton property and the contro centers in the room, for light, curtains etc still displayed the Ritz-Carlton branding. 

In total we stayed at the hotel six days / five nights. During the stay we tried most of what the hotel had to offer. The Sika restaurant where we had dinner the first night and also breakfast each morning. The dinner was good, my wife and I both enjoyed it, although since we had been traveling all day, to Ireland, and the hotel in the morning and then around locally in Ireland in the afternoon, by time desert can we were both pretty tired and were not able to eat very much of it, but what we tried was good, and we enjoyed the first course and main courses. 

Breakfast in the Sika was good too, I did see a review that was not that good regarding the breakfast, but we found it pretty good.  If you like a full Irish breakfast then there was plenty to choose from, there was also lighter option available, fruits, yogurts and pastries if a continental choice was what you are looking for. 

We did some sightseeing as far away as Giants causeway and Cliffs of Moher, but if you don’t want to go that far you can easily drive to Dublin. Close to the hotel, within the estate grounds there is the largest waterfall in Ireland, it was nice to see but don’t expect Niagra Falls otherwise you will be disappointed. It was nice to walk in the area and see the waterfall, that has apparently appeared in a number of movies and series. 
We also tried out the hotel pool and spar which was worth a visit.  
The staff were friendly

217,Lunch in the Sugar Loaf Lounge,We brought a family group of 13 for lunch. The menu is quite limited but nevertheless was satisfactory as a light meal and the service was excellent. We had four small children and they were well looked after also.,5,2018,10,06
217,"Nice rooms, below average food, conflicted about the spa","We are just completing our two-night stay here and I am a bit torn. I really liked some things and thought that others were below par.

First the positives:

- The room was very large and we had a huge separate walk-in closet and very large and luxurious looking bathroom with a huge tub, and separate shower and toilet. 

- The nearby gardens and shop are a real treat.

- I had several spa treatments and they were generally good. 

- The lobby looks nice and has at least one fireplace.

- The spa relaxation room is nice but they need to enforce the silence rule and check supplies - the tea pot was often empty/low.

- The staff were generally nice and helpful.

Then the downsides:

- The much-lauded spa facilities were disappointing. I’ve been to the ESPA at the Corinthia in London, but even without that comparison point, this one seemed run down. There was peeling and bubbling paint, not enough supplies in the dressing rooms (no cotton swabs for example), filthy shower walls and very neglected thermal area, with lots of dirt, grime, and calcium build-up. The Hammam looked so dirty (literally black grime) that I didn’t want to stay even a few minutes. The warm pool wasn’t warm enough and again dirty and shabby looking. I didn’t end up using the facilities at all on either day on which I had spa treatments. The staff were nice, though they over-use addressing you by your first name. I think it is the latest fashion in customer service but it was a bit over the top.

- The food is below average. I ate one lunch at the spa - very disappointing. A 24 Euro bento box is the only option available and the food was of airline quality. A sad lukewarm tomato soup, a small bowl of greens with feta, a sandwich (the only part you can choose) that in my case had a tiny amount of hummus and some tasteless vegetables -  no butter/oil or salt/pepper brought to the table to make it a bit more bearable. Dessert was overly sweet and certainly not along the lines of what you would think of as spa cuisine.  Food for our events was equally uninspired. Breakfast was just ok - seemingly plenty of choice but nothing looked too exciting (will try their cooked to order options tomorrow) and my soya cappuccino was undrinkable (something happened with the milk and it went all lumpy). 

- a bit strange to be given cold sorbet after spa treatments. I think, and especially in cold weather, this isn’t ‘right’ - maybe mint tea or something like that. 

Overall I don’t think I would return.",3,2018,10,06
217,A Five Star Experience,"Wow. We entered our suite to discover a huge, luxurious bathroom, a dedicated closet/luggage room as well as a very large bedroom with a gorgeous view.  I had trouble using the provided coffee maker even though I followed the directions.
The lobby is enormous with a lot of comfortable seating. 
We enjoyed the pool area and were pleased that the time that this space was open to children was strictly adhered to by the staff. Because the pool is part of the spa it was nice to be able to enjoy the water after the lights were dimmed and the noise level decreased.  This enabled adults to relax and enjoy some child-free time. One young couple had left their children with grandparents in order to have some special time together and they were very happy that the hotel made this accommodation that allowed everyone to use and enjoy the space. 
We had thought that we would have dinner in the pub on the premises. We walked in, were seated at an isolated table by the entrance and were immediately put off by the lack of atmosphere, the cold temperature and the time it took for the staff to notice that we were there. After a time someone noticed us. We had to ask that the table be wiped and then we sat again waiting to be served.  We left and went upstairs and had dinner in the upper lounge area. The food was good but extremely expensive. It was a lunch menu and the portions were very small.  After many nights of formal dining on our trip we wanted something more casual than the dining room. Our waiter had difficulty sorting out our orders on three separate bills for us and two other couples. The waiter who served us had disappeared and someone else presented our bills. Eventually it was all sorted out but not without difficulty. 
Breakfast was included with our room and it was lovely. There was a large selection of breakfast items.  
The grounds were lovely and the setting was gorgeous. All in all, a very memorable hotel. ",5,2018,10,06
217,Birthday celebrations,"My family and I had a most wonderful weekend is the Powerscourt Hotel in September.
The ambiance is lovely, the rooms are great and the spa was so very relaxing.  We also had a lovely swim, a walk by the river, my daughters had a morning run on the beautiful avenue and the food in the restaurant and the Sugarloaf Lounge was brilliant!! I would greatly recommend a stay or a visit!",5,2018,10,02
217,"The Good and the"" Needs Fixing""","The Good:
The hotel is beautiful and the setting in the Wicklow Mountains is gorgeous. We were upgraded to one of the most luxurious rooms/suite that we had ever stayed in, and we are well traveled. Overseas reservations made via the internet were efficient and followed by updates from the hotel and we bought a package that included breakfast and a dinner in the Sitka restaurant. Complimentary tickets to the Powerscourt Gardens were given to us on arrival which we were unable to use because we arrived around 4:00 pm and the Gardens closed at 5:00 . Note to guests: Check in as soon as allowed and use the wonderful facilities. The pool was great, the steam room and sauna were  superb .It is the beauty of the hotel and property which compels me to give this hotel 4/5. My issue is with staffing and as we were there in mid September, I wonder if staffing is a seasonal issue.  I must note that the trainee at the front desk was very good on arrival and departure.

The ""Needs Fixing"".
As many other reviewers have noted, a reservation at the Sitka Dining Room is very often changed to a meal in the Lounge at the end of the Lobby. Our meal was mediocre at best and the service EXTREMELY slow. With the exception of one, none of the waiters were Irish and most seemed to be in training. The majority of people working at the resort were from other parts of the EU and seemed to be "" in training"".  

Breakfast in the Sitka Dining Room in the morning was not up to the level of this class of hotel. The floor also had food on it under the tables and looked as if it had not been well cleaned from the event that went on there the night before... which forced hotel guests  to eat in the Lounge.

We were also contacted the day after leaving the hotel about one item missing from the mini-bar ...which we DID NOT use...and that has never happened to us before in our world travels and is definitely not a good PR move for a hotel of this caliber.",4,2018,10,02
217,Really disappointed,"My wife and I love this property and visit 4/5 times annually however we’ve been let down!!! We couldn’t manage to book a room, but as we love Sika and McGills so much, decided to stay in another local hotel to avail of the facilities.
We booked a table in sika via Open Table last week and have been just informed by a rude east European that the restaurant has been block booked and no tables are available. This person was of the opinion that we were staying at the hotel and offered us the Sika menu at The Sugarloaf but when told we were staying elsewhere this offer was rescinded.
Really disappointed, but am aware that things like this happen, but am angered at the attitude of this east European women, Angela on the phone. Certainly wouldn’t get this kind of treatment at The Merrion!!!

Note to management: Update your OpenTable app if you decide to allow block booking of your restaurant!",1,2018,09,30
217,Beautiful out of the city hotel,"Perfect spot to seclude business folks for a small conference or set of meetings. Lobby, meeting spaces, restaurants and rooms are all excellent (though I wish the rooms were more electronically updated with usb outlets near the bed) Nice shared balcony, but was a bit chilly to stay out there

Friendly staff and always fruit and some kind of water and/or cider in the lobby. Great food (Irish breakfasts!) as part of the conference catering too

Do take a spin through the gardens while there - you’ll regret not doing so if you, like I did, don’t think you’ll return. 10 min walk to get there. 10e charge. Plan at least an hour to see it all. ",5,2018,09,30
217,"No longer a Ritz Carlton, but 1st class service remains!","Quiet, efficient, unobtrusive Service delivered with a smile. Gorgeous, oversized rooms, with great views and top of the line furniture and fixtures. The grounds are a photographers dream.... would definitely return",5,2018,09,29
217,NOT GOING TO FALL ALL OVER THIS PLACE,"We had a very nice stay here
I found it to be the best value on the trip
Hotel is beautiful 
Rooms elegant
Service at times excellent, other times they seemed understaffed and inexperienced 
Our experience at breakfast each day was not the best
The grounds had the feel of neglected maintenance

The river walk was nice BUT
a place the locals take their dogs for a walk
Just like in the states, landmines

The town of Enniskerry was a nice walk

Very relaxing  over all

Not the place i would choose for a base for a trip if doing Dublin
But for the price it has no problem getting my approval",4,2018,09,28
217,It deserves its 5 stars,"5 star hotels are easy to pick out from the moment you pull up to the entrance. Powers court is one of them and did not disappoint throughout the stay.

A magnificently beautiful hotel with no detail left unattended. The pool is a special demand should not be missed.

Very much appreciated is the on the hour service to take you down to Enniskerry.
We had a lovely room on the 6th floor overlooking the mountains. It ranks up there with some of the nicest rooms I have stayed in anywhere in the world. The breakfast is a must have with an incredible selection of wonderfully prepared foods.

In the interest of full disclosure there was a speed bump. The signature Sika restaurant we had reserved for dinner was closed for a private party and we were moved to the much more relaxed,but also beautiful, Sugarloaf Lounge. We were supposed to have a glass of bubbles on the house which the staff had no idea about and while the menu was small but fine and the food tasty it was not the meal we were hoping for. We brought this up to the maitre d who was was completely understanding and apologetic and asked that we check in with the manager at checkout. We did , and the manager could not have been more gracious and immediately comped the dinner. The expected response!
Another discriminator for great properties is how they handle guest complaints and this one was handled as you would  expect of a high caliber hotel.

The Wicklow mountains are breathtaking and are a must see. Powerscourt will take that experience to a higher level. It is a must stop in Ireland and so close to Dublin you will be sorry if you do not stop by",5,2018,09,28
217,Disappointed,"I was very disappointed with this property. I would rate it as a 3 or 4 star hotel.  My room was dated, and other than the bellman, service was average or subpar.  I did enjoy hiking the area.  However, I was disappointed that the gate was locked at the end of the river walk, forcing me to repeat my steps back to the entrance.",2,2018,09,27
217,Distinguish experience ,"I stayed in this amazing resort with my wife's. It was just amazing. Beautiful place to be I was lucky to find a booking it was fully occupied which I understand not surprised at all. With such cleanliness, beautify, nature and friendly staff treating you just as royal visitor. I dedicate my thanks to Maika, Samual, Daivad, and the others. They all did wonder full job to make our experience special.

I would 10,000% recommend the place. And I would visit it soon definitely. 

My regards and best wishes ",5,2018,09,27
217,Pure Luxury,"I booked this hotel for my husbands 62nd birthday last week. I know that it can cost more than the norm but because he had suffered with cancer I thought it would be special. This hotel and staff did not disappoint. The receiptionist was called Sophia who told me that due to our visit she had given us an upgrade and also sent chocolates to the room. The foyer is fabulous with views of their fantastic gardens. The bedroom was magnificent. Pure luxury,from the slippers to the bedding. The decor is beautiful and the bathroom is something else. We had  balcony with outside table and chairs but we didnt have a front garden view which would have been exceptional but we didnt care. Everyone was so helpful and friendly from the managers to the cleaning staff. 
What a wonderful hotel for a special treat.I give this hotel 100% Didn't find a fault.",5,2018,09,26
217,Fantastic Hotel in Beautiful Location,"From the moment you turn onto the driveway to the hotel, you can tell this is a special place.  The grounds are immaculate.  The views are quintessential Ireland - green and brown rolling hills and mountains.  We had a room on the top floor: I believe a junior suite.  Lots of space.  The furnishings and bathrooms were first class.  The staff were all very friendly and helpful.",5,2018,09,24
217,The name says it all,"Great rooms, gardens, golf, food and service. This is a large hotel about 30 min outside Dublin. 
The rooms were large and up to date, there were three diverse places to eat, get some libation and/or be entertained. Beautiful views of the countryside. A golf facility within a 5 minute walk, offering two very nice courses.
It’s pretty much self-contained providing most, if not all, needs.
",5,2018,09,20
217,Superb from start to finish ,"Stayed just 1 night in a mountain view 2 room suite.
The room was superb, tonnes of space, great facilities, really clean and very comfortable - a touch of luxury.
We found any dealings we had with staff was of a high standard - friendly, helpful, attentive and well trained. This really adds to a stay to say the least.
We had dinner in the Sika restaurant - every course was excellent, great choice, beautiful balance of flavours. A truly memorable meal for all the right reasons
Breakfast was buffet style with a wide choice and high quality food, a great start to a new day.
",5,2018,09,20
217,Nice ,"This is a nice hotel, would return on another trip. Only downfall was check in, room was not ready an hour and half after we arrived. No apology from staff and no offer of a coffee while we waited. Other than that a good stay. Thank you ",2,2018,09,18
217,Dream come true,"Our son was married here about a week ago.  We all stayed at the hotel as well.  He married a girl from Dublin.  I can not explain how fabulous the hotel was the service as well.  Five Star all the way.  We had a lovely suite, the wedding was at the Powerscourt House and we had a rehearsal dinner at the McGill pub at the hotel which was also fabulous!",5,2018,09,16
217,Nice retreat,"The hotel is situated on a beautiful property and recommend getting a mountain view room.  The hotel was comfortable and had undergone some improvements in the recent past.  The rooms were well appointed and met all of our needs.  There are 3 restaurants on property and recommend getting reservations for the one you want.     While the gym is available 24 hours, the pool closes when the spa closes (about 9) which was a disappointment.  The hotel service was also just okay.  While there were some superstars, like, Stephen in the pub and Jack in the upstairs bar, the rest of the staff needs some polish and work.  As an example, car was fetched by valet when we checked out, he returned with the car, gave me the key and walked away.  Absolutely no offer for the bags.  This was one of several lack of service situations.  You'd expect more from this hotel .",4,2018,09,16
217,Exquisite Anniversary Vacation Hotel ,"Simply Amazing.   When we arrived our room was not ready.  We had lunch in the lobby cafe which is gorgeous and the food was excellent.  After lunch our room still was not ready and we were exhausted from an overnight flight with no sleep.  The lovely young girl was able to get us in an upgraded suite with no Mountain View. We were hesitant because we had a Mountain View booked.  The suite was absolutely incredible.  We were blown away, it was a full sized luxurious apartment.  The best beds in Ireland.  Only one complaint, the hair dyers are awful, loud, and barely work.  There are no plugs in the bathroom if you were to bring your own.  Hopefully the replace them.  The grounds and visiting Powerscourt house make it a wonderful visit.",5,2018,09,15
217,The most amazing hotel ,"Out of all the hotels I’ve ever stayed in, Powerscourt is without doubt one the best. We had a mountain view room for 2 nights and it was beautiful. Room was so spacious with a balcony, little sitting area and an amazing bathroom. The grounds are breathtaking and service was excellent from start to finish in the bar, at reception, breakfast time. Parking facilities excellent and the pool area was fab! Although I didn’t use the spa during this visit I will on the next trip as we loved it so much we are going to go back for a special occasion before Christmas 2018. I can’t wait to return 🥂",5,2018,09,15
217,Weekend Tetreat,"I’m sorry but if you aspire to five stars, then the air conditioner should work in the suite, bedside lamps should work, and anniversary date dinner reservations should not be lost.
Great location, but not good enough.",3,2018,09,13
217,Just fab ,"This hotel is really special. From
The moment you arrive it’s relaxing and very luxurious. Staff are very helpful and the rooms were just gorgeous. Highly recommend it, we had a staycation and travelled to it from Glenlo Abbey Hotel in Galway which was equally as relaxing and luxurious. Can’t wait to return. ",5,2018,09,13
217,My Favourite Hotel in Ireland hands down,"I have stayed here on numerous occasions and it just an all round fab hotel.  Book a suite with a Mountain View and you won't regret it.  The staff are great the grounds are fabulous, its my happy place.  Its my dream wedding venue without a doubt",5,2018,09,13
217,Amazing Service ,"Powerscourt is a MUST stay if your in Ireland... a bit hard to reach but definitely worth the effort !  Golf course is beautiful and hotel grounds & rooms are exceptionally well maintained. Views are just incredible .... lobby is amazing ...

Staff goes beyond your expectations... Book your spa ahead for they do fill up !   Food and drinks were great ! Nice shops up the road for a nice stroll .... will definitely go back !  ",5,2018,09,10
217,Wow absolutely the best hotel and staff ever!!!,"My husband and my self just got married and we stayed here for our honeymoon, and it was just amazing from the staff the room the food and scenery all just out of this world. Thanks to all the staff who made our wedding day so amazing. We can't wait to go back every year for our anniversary.x",5,2018,09,10
217,Very nice,"We enjoyed our stay and found the staff to be very polite and helpful. Only complaint was that you couldn't lower the in room temp lower than 16 degrees Celsius so sleeping, even with the windows open, was not as comfortable as we'd of liked. Other than that, it was a lovely stay!",5,2018,09,08
217,Stunning!,"My partner and I have just returned from a 3 night stay at the beautiful Powerscourt Hotel.  From the moe,nt we arrived in the hotel we found the staff attentive and helpful.  Our room was fabulous and extremely spacious. The bathroom was elegant and spotless, with a choice of a bath and separate shower. ",5,2018,09,08
217,Amazing.,"This hotel exceeded our expectations. Upon arrival, the front desk staff was prepared and got us checked in quickly so that we could get to our room after a long day of travel. Once in the room, we were greeted by a very clean, cool, and fresh smelling room. The grounds are absolutely beautiful, the interior of the hotel was lovely, and the overall stay was just perfect. Highly recommend and hope to visit again.",5,2018,09,07
217,5 star for good reason,"I have stayed a number of times at this hotel and on each occasion it just ticks all the boxes. Easy check in all staff are super friendly, the hotel lobby area has had a refurb in recent times and it looks great. Our room was superb and from bed linen to bath robes all were great. We dined in the Sika restaurant and the food was excellent. Facilities are great and the only disappointment was there was no availability for a treatment my wife had hoped to secure. Hardy a complaint but more a compliment to the hotel they are doing things right if they are booked up..
All in all highly recommended .",5,2018,09,07
217,Late summer splendour,"My wife and I stayed at the Powerscourt Hotel from the 4th to the 6th of September as part of a late summer trip. We booked the 2 night bed and breakfast and one evening meal package and it was superb.
We were welcomed like long lost family and shown to our room straightaway although we had arrived 2 hours early. The room was comfortable, large and spacious - we especially liked the separate dressing room area and the remote control lights and air conditioning switches in the bedside tables!
The hotel was spotless, staff courteous to a fault and the food, both at breakfast and at our evening meal in the Sika restaurant, delicious. We didn't have a mountain view room but that didn't matter, as we were able to enjoy the beautiful views from the veranda whilst enjoying a cool drink. We used the pool each day and it is large and very relaxing swimming over the cool black marble tiles. The gym is very well equipped and, importantly, supervised at all times - I had to use it to ease the guilt of over indulgence!
If you stay, don't miss Powerscourt House which is just 5 minutes walk away and has beautiful gardens and shops. The charming St. Patrick's church in Enniskerry is also worth a visit.
We really enjoyed our trip and hope to visit this excellent hotel again. Thanks to all the staff who made our stay so memorable.
",5,2018,09,06
217,"Excellent Restaurant, pity about the wine.","We stayed here for a weekend break and found the hotel buzzing compared to our last visit some 4 years ago. It was a good sign and I have to say, well desreved. Powerscourt Hotel is in an enviable location as it sits in or around the Powerscourt gardens and Waterfall, is only a few miles away from Greystones (a quaint coaster village brimming with 'organic' food and small shops in very nicely layed out promenades on the beachfront.).

The hotel itself is in a beautiful building with excellent gardens and with all the amenities you would expect in a nice 5 star hotel. Pub, restuarant, 'pool', spa. My wife, having spent a few hours there, said she found the Hotel Spa to be 'the best in Ireland'.

Our room (a standard double) was larger than average for a hotel, had a wonderful bathroom and a separate dressing room. The bed was comfortable even though the sheets were not changed daily and if you wanted your beed turned down, you actually had to contact housekeeping and request it!. The room, overall, was excellently furnished and the amenities provided in the room were well up to a 5 star standard.

The food in the hotel restaurant 'Sika' where we dined twice was excellent on both occasions. The breakfast is also served in the same venue and the buffet was reasonably varied catering to most tastes with the emphasis being on the 'full Irish'.

Now some negatives: Both bottles of wine that we ordered on two separate nights with dinner, were 'heat' damaged and gone sour. While we did not return them, we did not mange to drink them. It seems the hotel cellar was not up to this year's Summer heat.

While in many hotels you find controls for the air conditioning system which are redundant s the system is controlled centally. Powerscourt Hotel has removed the 'reduntant' controls from the rooms totally which in my opinion is a more dignified solution. 

The coffee maker in the room however was not working well and wasted more of the coffee capsules provided than made us coffee, so needed repair. The TV froze on the opening screen on the second day we were there and we made do without for the rest of our stay. The safe in the room was 'broken' so was unusable during our stay. Preventative 'maintanance' seems to be available only 'on request', like turning down your bed...

Having said all that, would we stay there again? You bet.",5,2018,09,06
217,Stunning room in a beautiful hotel!,Short visit to the Powerscourt Hotel to celebrate our 25th wedding anniversary in August. Beautiful hotel in a gorgeous setting - our room was absolutely stunning! The staff could not have been friendlier - in particular Rebecca in McGill’s Bar and Jason at breakfast. We’ll certainly be back to stay there again!,5,2018,09,05
217,Our best hotel stay ever,"We are lucky enough to be able to travel and stay in nice place but this hotel was far the best we ever stayed.
Beautiful from the front door all the way to the garden.
Get upgraded to one bed-suite with garden view and the room was just amazing so as the balcony.
Nicely decorated and everything is high quality.
Staff was really professional in every department and they were there to help all the time. 
Wish we can stayed for longer.
",5,2018,09,02
217,Absolutely Fabulous ,"We hosted an Afternoon Tea party for our little girls birthday. From the moment Shannon called me to confirm the details to the very end of the party the staff were phenomenal.
Niamh provided service that I have only experienced before in the Dorchester in London.
The food was also perfect. Nothing was too much trouble and our kids enjoyed every inch of the grounds and hotel.
Sincere thanks to Niamh and Manager Shannon you were amazing.",5,2018,09,02
217,Amazing Place,"Stayed 5 nights August 2018. 1st time for my wife and I from the USA.  The countryside was so green and the country roads like out of country living magazine.  Yes, it is close to Dublin and most all of the east coast of Ireland.  The Hotel was excellent in all aspects, the staff also fantastic.  We had a problem with our booking thru Marriott.com but the hotel fixed it and even upgraded us to a 2 room suite.  Less than a 10 min walk was the powerscourt gardens listed as the 3rd most beautiful gardens WW by National Geographic and it lived up to its reputation.  The dining full breakfast had everything with plenty of staff to respond to any of our needs. Evening dining was great and the prices very reasonable.  The setting over looking the valley and hills is very romantic.
I would advise not driving to dublin but rather take a taxi.  The city is so busy, parking would be impossible.  We have stayed in Marriott Autograph Hotels in other cities and they all live up to the high standard, but my wife and I agree, this Hotel was the best we have been to.

When Visiting Ireland, we recommend getting to the west Coast for the Dingle Peninsula,  the Cliff of Moher, and Galway, - such a fun city...  Please note if you drive, the roads are narrow, with driving on the left, and sheep that like to walk in the road.

217,Unreal just unreal,"Absolutely beautiful place from service, to food and a great spa experience and coupled with local walking and sampling the great local foods. An easy 5 stars from my wife & I and a place we will defo be returning to on a special occasion ",5,2018,08,30
217,Proposal ,"My now fiancé proposed to me in one of the suites on the balcony overlooking the mountains and it was perfect. Utterly, utterly perfect. The overall hotel experience itself was lovely. It’s what happened after that that was a bit disappointing. In the excitement, I left a new bottle of foundation, nail polish and a pair of Prada sunglasses in the room, on the table in the sitting room area. Despite ringing about this and following up with an email, no one got back to me. I had to call again before I was told that the hotel had a policy of disposing ‘perishable’ items and so the foundation and nail polish would have been thrown away. They were both brand new and had been used once. This was extremely annoying. Why I wasn’t phoned when these items were found by housekeeping is beyond me. The sunglasses were also ‘never found’. At this stage, I am down approx €400 in items I left behind in my excitement at becoming engaged. I accept that was my fault. I was really quite annoyed at the way the hotel dealt with the matter, however. Not how I would expect a 5* to behave. We were also charged twice for the room and I was required to email ‘proof’ of this in the form of a screenshot of the online banking information before a refund was processed. 

The spa experience was absolutely fantastic but the policy of segregating men and women is bizarre and out of place in Ireland, in my view. 

The swimming pool area was extremely noisy with children shouting and not at all relaxing after the quiet and bliss of the spa area. 

Dinner in Sika was fine, and I will leave a separate review of that. 

Overall, the jury is out on Powerscourt. It will forever hold the most wonderful memories for me. However, certain aspects are certainly lacking. ",4,2018,08,27
217,DECEDANT,"Incredible setting with amenities galore. Located 30 minutes from Dublin, yet close to all small towns along the coast. We could drive to about any golf club within 45 minutes. We played a different course every day for a week",5,2018,08,27
217,Wedding,"this hotel is amazing more than expected,Staff were exceptional and we were waited on hand and foot from the moment we stepped out of the car/ excellent customer service, rooms were absolutely  Fab spotless clean, food was great and lots of it cant wait to go back again",5,2018,08,27
217,Pleasant luxurious stay in beautiful location,"We visited Powerscourt Hotel for a weekend in July 2018. We attended a friend’s wedding nearby and the location was ideal.

The hotel offers five star accommodation and services. Everything was immaculately prepared and organised. 

As guests we had free access to the beautiful spa and swimming pool as well as surrounding gardens and paths. In the evening there was a gig in the in-house pub.

The hotel is located in the middle of nature reserve and next to an estate which you can pay a visit (beautiful Japanese gardens). It is also a short drive to Powerscourt waterfalls. 

We hired the bikes offered by the hotel and enjoyed a bike ride in Enniskerry village. A visit to the local is a must (for a pint of Guinness)!

Very happy with our stay in this elegant hotel. 

",5,2018,08,26
217,Wonderful stay,"We stayed here as a friend was getting married and having ceremony and celebration in the hotel.and we were very pleased.all of the staff were wonderful at all times,the room was splendid and ultra luxurious,breakfast was excellent,both the buffet and the options for ordering-the eggs Florentine and the omelette were perfect.and as for the view and the gardens,hard to beat.we will be back again.",5,2018,08,25
217,Beautiful grounds,"Stayed here for several days.  The area around the hotel was astonishingly picturesque, you can grab an electric bicycle from the hotel and whiz around the Powerscourt estate and surrounding area.  Very happy to have stayed here.",5,2018,08,24
217,"5 star hotel, but some little things were a bit annoying...","We were only staying one night - a quiet escape on a Tuesday night - and wanted to make the most of our 24 hours.  Firstly we were told it was a 4pm check-in which is really very late for a hotel, particularly a 5 star.  We booked two rooms - one was ready at 4pm, the other wasn't ready until almost 5pm - we all waited in one room.  By the time we got our second room and went to explore we missed the opportunity to visit Powerscourt gardens next door - they close at 5.30 and wouldn't let us in...  Why such a late check in time, and if our room wasn't going to be ready until 5pm, why did reception not advise us to visit Powerscourt House and Gardens next door to avoid being turned away due to their late check-in.  5pm for a 5 star hotel really isn't good enough.  We ate our evening meal in McGills - very dark - we had to ask for candles for the table so we could see the menus.  I ordered the Lamb Kofta, a dish I usually enjoy.  However, this was so over-seasoned it was actually inedible - I returned it and asked for a chicken wrap instead which was a better choice.  In the morning, I asked for toast with my breakfast - by the time the toast arrived my breakfast was finished.  The girl from whom I had ordered the toast was cleaning tables and must have forgotten my order until she saw me ready to leave.  That said, the staff members are very friendly - it is such a pity that these small little things took from what should have been a 5 star experience.  Beautiful building, lovely staff, disappointing overall.",3,2018,08,23
217,Really restful stay,"This hotel is gorgeous. The view in the foyer is spectacular and the rooms feel lush. 
The pool area is one of the nicer ones I've used and you can't help but feel relaxed there.
Had a wonderful treatment in the spa and couldn't have asked for better service, felt so looked after. The views from the tranquility room where you go after your treatment are breathtaking.
Food and beverages from the main foyer area are pretty pricey but I suppose that's unsurprising for a 5 star.",4,2018,08,22
217,Could be so much better,"It was a number of little things that made our stay disappointing. We were unable to check in until 4.40pm as our room wasn’t ready when we arrived despite check in being from 4. We were told to wait and would get a call when the room was ready and no complimentary tea/coffee was offered which would have been nice given we were waiting 40 minutes. We had spa treatment booked for 5pm which meant we had to rush to be there for 4.50. Again, we were waiting 10-15 mins for consultation form to fill in and be brought to meet our therapist. My treatment was cut short as I was told I was late and I was brought to the relaxation area. My friends didn’t arrive until 10 minutes later even though we had all booked our treatments for 5pm so it was just mine that was shortened. These little things just made our stay not as pleasant as it should have been. The food in the SIKA restaurant was delicious and the rooms were lovely and very comfortable. Food at breakfast was very nice but we requested milk for our tea/coffee. When it didn’t appear after 10 minutes I asked a young man in training and he brought it straight away. The server who we originally requested it from arrived 20 minutes later with the milk by which time it was too late. The server in training with his lovely manner and customer service was the highlight of our stay. Some highs, some lows but not enough for me to come back.",2,2018,08,21
217,Excellent....beautiful!,Stayed here for 2 days last week - excellent gem of a hotel in a beautiful part of Ireland. A big thank you to Ruth on reception - she made us feel part of the family! The room we had was excellent - overall we could not fault it - thanks for making it a memorable stay.,5,2018,08,20
217,Was it third time lucky,"I reviewed this hotel a few months ago after visiting twice with issues. So why visit a 3rd time in a matter of months if we had issues the first 2 times? We had Marriot points for a free stay and you only have two choices in Ireland.
So was the third stay better? Well yes.
We didnt take Powerscourt up on the option to contact them before our stay, after the last free upgrade wasnt great.
We checked in after bookling a standard room, but recieved a better room with a balcony, not expected but was nice. The quality of this room was far better than the previous visit. The room was clean and tidy.
The staff still arent what I expect, very wooden and cold. They dont have the friendly relaxed approach you expect in Ireland. They still have that 'Ritz Carton' feel, but they are forgetting that was many years ago.
We ordered deserts to the room, which came promptly and were lovely.
The only real negative is that the beds were 2 queen sized, and the dovet was a queen size, but the dovet cover was far far to large, touching the floor on either side, just spare cover.. A negative with housekeeping again.",4,2018,08,20
217,Gorgeous,This was a gorgeous hotel in a great spot in Wicklow.  The customer service was great!  We had two rooms that were upgraded that didn't really work for our family.  They fixed it and gave us two adjoining rooms.  My girls used the pool during the family swim time.   Food was great for breakfast.  My girls loved using the make your own pancake machine!  They have bicycles that you can use and a special path you can walk along the river.  We have stayed at a lot of Marriott properties and this is one of the nicest ones!  The views of the mountains when you walk in the hotel will take your breath away!,5,2018,08,19
217,Best ever,We flew into Dublin on a overnight flight. On a Bank Holiday so car rental took close to 2 hours to get a car so by time we pulled up to Powerscourt we were exhausted! Place looked fantastic but we went straight to our room which was huge and beautiful view of Sugarloaf mountain. We were in room 536. Whole family slept for 5 hours straight! Next morning I woke up early so I hiked to the river walk which was a pretty far hike. I suggest u drive to Riverwalk then hike it. Family was still tired so we missed breakfast. We went walking around the grounds which are beautiful. This hotel only allows kids to swim from 4-6 pm but we all loved the pool area! Next day we drove to the waterfall which is worth seeing and we hiked around Enniskerry which is a cool town nearby! Third day we took bus from Enniskerry into Dublin right by Trinity! This bus was great for us I think only 50 minute ride. No way did I want to drive into Dublin and pay for parking! I forgot by this time we had breakfast both days at hotel and it was awesome. Food was incredible while looking at mountain and Nikko was a professional host.Super nice and great with kids.We checked out and drove to west coast for 5 nights but had set up to spend last night back at Powerscourt because short ride to Dublin. When we returned we went straight to a tour of The Gardens which is a must-AWESOME and right next to the hotel.  We were able to get in the kids swimming time.  This place was one of the nicest hotels I ever stayed in! I wish I stayed there more nights than I did.  Only thing that comes close to a complaint was the food at MaGills PUB which is in the hotel wasnt that good but it is bar food. I enjoyed hanging out there and having drinks but food was average at best. NEAL the bartendar was a nice guy!  If you walk from hotel to front entrance gate views are very pretty!  Looking forward to a return visit!,5,2018,08,18
217,Beautiful hotel and grounds,"My family was pleased with our stay here and spa experience. We stayed in a large guest room with a King bed and didn't want to leave.

This hotel seems very equipped for babies and toddlers, including high chairs and a nice mini playground outside. My toddler had a lot of space to run around. 

The breakfast buffet was excellent. 

The spa was great. One thing I will say I think they could use more staff to pick up used towels and clean the floors more. I was happy with the heat room experience and serenity room. The hotel pool was lovely too.  

The grounds are exceptional. Also, we loved walking to Powerscourt gardens (6 minutes away). 

Overall, we really enjoyed our time here and would definitely come back.",5,2018,08,17
217,Hotel stunning with just not the service expected ,"Our last stop from 2 weeks of Ireland. Absolutely stunning hotel with huge stunning rooms that need a better cleaning.  Our bathroom wall was dirty and shower head dirty.  The bellman asked where we had traveled and proceeded to tell us we had done it all wrong and missed the best parts.  Well thank you and hello to you too!   I had to ask at front desk for map of hotel and grounds. Never offered. 
2 small restaurants for this gigantic hotel.  The nicer one booked for the evening so went to the pub. A fake pub where we were told to find an available table. The only table left was dirty but we sat and waited for someone to clean it. After getting cleaned ordered our drinks.  30 minutes later still not water and had asked 4 people.  My Guinness still had not arrived. Told it takes that long to pour one because of foam.  Really?  I contacted front desk but they did nothing.  Said they would ask someone to bring us water.  Completely understaffed with the less hospitable staff of any establishment of entire trip.  
This morning coffee makers in both of our rooms did not work. Only hot water came out. I called front desk and they were aware and sent 2 cups of tiny coffee to our room instead. On checking out I asked for manager who never appeared and front desk staff didn’t seem to care.  This should be a five star review but for the service.  This hotel is stunning and beautiful but lacked any Ireland charm, no music being played and just not the service expected. ",3,2018,08,16
217,THIS is the way to travel!!,"How lucky we were to spend a couple of nights at this hotel and, tour the beautiful 40-acre garden.  This was a splurge.  We've never stayed in a hotel this nice.  The suite, the service, the employees, the restaurant breakfast buffets, the pub, the views ... all were amazing!  Top notch service.  The gardens, although separate and there is a fee, are fantastic!  An easy walk from the hotel and then into ""paradise."" Wish we could travel like this on every occasion!",5,2018,08,14
217,Standards slipping,"Stayed here last night 12th August. Third time to stay in this hotel. Splashed out on a one bedroom suite. First of all the room was not ready, there were lots of other people arriving getting their rooms straight away, but we sat in the foyer for 90 mins before we were finally given our key (without an apology or offer of refreshments) Room was lovely if a little shabby, scrapes on the walls, peeling paint, missing paintings from the walls etc. Touch controls for lights etc were temperamental. Had room service which was promptly delivered and delicious. This morning we went down to breakfast at 9.45am, and had to queue for a table. The restaurant seemed a bit understaffed, and tables were not cleared very promptly. Breakfast was ok, some of the items were running out and not replaced quickly so we gave up on most of it. Not 5 star standard or what we had experienced on our last two visits.",3,2018,08,13
217,Still a great hotel but Standards are Slipping,"We stay in this hotel about once a year, we had our youngest christening here a few years back and have always defaulted to Powerscourt as the closest hotel to Dublin to enjoy a 5 star short break. The hotel is expensive but we’ve always felt it was value for money based on the quality of experience. This was our 4th time to stay and unfortunately it’s clear that standards are slipping.

The welcome at the door was as effusive as usual with an older lady on the door making a fuss of our 3 year old. Check in was as efficient as usual with the receptionist noting that our reservation included breakfast. Our room was 116 and was described as a Triple Room. When we got to the room, it was spacious and had a King size bed and 2 queen size beds; a large bathroom with both a Tub and a shower; a dressing room and a hallway.

So far so good, until we realized that the TV could not easily be seen from the King Size bed. (See picture), and there was no headboard for the King Sizebed!! We moved the lamp which was in the way and slept horizontally on the bed to allow us watch TV from bed. We also noted that the wall where there should probably have been a headboard was damaged...not something you would expect in a $400 a night room.

Having rearranged the room we headed for the bar downstairs for Dinner, the service was up to its usual high standard with the barman going above and beyond the call of duty to source extra drawing paper for our 3 year old to busy himself drawing Dinosaurs while we waited for dinner.

We went to bed and watched TV somewhat awkwardly as there was no support behind us....it worked just about. A big plus was the easy way you can drop the Netflix on your IPAD onto the TV screen using screen mirroring. The on screen guide is misleading, but the receptionist explained the workaround and we had our own Netflix to watch for the duration of our stay.

We were woken the next morning at 930 by housekeeping wanting to know if I wanted the room made up (didn’t think it was an “opt in” service but said I did but not just yet!; it would be more normal to get this question much later in the day in my experience)

We went down to breakfast and were surprised to find no record of us on the breakfast list, the manager made a note and seated us anyway. The breakfast was as good as usual with very prompt and obliging service. We didn’t make the list the next day either, the waitress didn’t bother to make a note so I assume it’s a regular occurrence.

We went for a swim in the pool (kids times are 9am to 11am and 4pm to 6pm), the pool was great and there were various floats in the pool for the kids. This is our little guys big event and it didn’t disappoint, we spent a lot of time there and had great fun.

The next day a different maid woke us at 910 with the same question about cleaning the room....I gave the same answer and was asked what time I wanted the room done...aka. when will you get up so I can clean the room!!...efficiency at the cost of customer service

As a treat on the last day we ordered room service, the experience in the past was that the service was prompt and delivered ahead of time (we were told 40 to 45 minutes..in the end it arrived after 75 minutes later, prompted by a reminder call after an hour. In the interim, the 3 year old was hungry so I got the minibar chips (crisps) and was about to open them when I noted they were a month over their expiry date...when I put this together with lipstick stains we found on one of the wine glasses, I conclude the minibar is being poorly maintained.

All in all, this is still a great hotel but it looks like there is a drive for cost reduction (yes, I noticed fewer towels in the room as well as the over eager maid service....except the turndown which is now by request) which is impacting the 5 star experience.

217,So luxurious ,"We had a truly exceptional stay at the Powerscourt Hotel. It was a splurge for us on our trip and it was so worth it. 

We had a fairly basic room. We only upgraded to have a Mountain View. The room was HUGE and beautiful. It had a wide entry, with a huge dressing closet to the right (and I do mean huge!) and a stunning bathroom to the left. The room itself was so large. We had so much space. It was so nice! The bed was so comfy. 

Service was also top notch. We checked in on the map and everyone we interacted with was kind and helpful. 

The only hotel amenity we used was the back lawn and play area for kids, which was great. What a view! 

There is a convenient car park with lots of space. The hotel is situated very close to the Powerscourt estate, which you must visit. 

My only regret is not having more time to spend here. I highly recommend!",5,2018,08,12
217,Amazing place for rest and relaxation,Ursula and I checked into Powerscourt Hotel on Saturday 28th July looking forward to a restful and relaxing long weekend in luxurious surroundings with good food and facilities. Although we arrived early our room courtesy of Peter who we were told was director of operations was ready to occupy immediately and had been upgraded.  Champaign lunch overlooking the fabulous view of the Sugarloaf mountain settled us in nicely with the help of the very friendly staff amongst whom there were Shauna and Ross.  The main restaurant staff Ciara and her colleagues could not have been more helpful and friendly.  In short we were completely relaxed on departure and would have no hesitation in recommending this venue.  Ursula and I will certainly return soon.,5,2018,08,12
217,Wonderful Anniversary ,"We spent a night here celebrating our wedding anniversary and had an amazing time.
We were upgraded on arrival which is always nice and the room was fabulous.

As the weather was poor we spent a lot of time in the spa/pool and that too was an oasis of calm and tranquility with quite possibly the biggest and most comfortable jacuzzi I have ever been in.

We eat dinner in Sika. The food was superb although the service was slow but as we were not rushing anywhere it didn’t matter. As it was our anniversary we were presented with a little dessert with Happy Anniversary written on it - a real nice touch.

I can’t add too much more than what other reviewers have said - the hotel, location and service is 5 star. Well done and we’ll be back.",5,2018,08,12
217,The Best in Hotel accommodation,Absolutely the best hotel I ever stayed in the staff were friendly and very professional at all times! The room was like an apartment so beautiful. I would recommend this hotel to anyone celebrating a anniversary and wanted a touch of luxury to help with the celebrations!!,5,2018,08,08
217,Quality and tranquility ,Swift and efficient  check in. Spotlessly clean accommodation-public areas and rooms. Spacious and luxurious room with views overlooking the breathtaking sugar loaf mountains. The room is well appointed with excellent amenities. Superb cleanliness throughout. House keeping do an excellent job. We used the concierge to help map out our visits and it was accurate and met our needs fully. If you want a luxury stay that is not based in Dublin this is the hotel to choose. Still retains lots of its Ritz Carlton character. You won’t be disappointed. ,5,2018,08,08
217,Beautiful,The area is just lovely and the nearby powerscourt gardens and waterfall are well worth the visit. The hotel is very luxurious but also sort of generic and the Irish pub in the basement was kind of fake. We did have great help from the concierge staff.,4,2018,08,08
217,Just as nice as the photos,"This was our first stop after getting off the flight to Dublin and boy were we spoiled. The hotel is just as gorgeous as the photos. The service is top notch and the rooms are very spacious. I'd recommend spending more than one night at the property to take advantage of all it has to offer, but our group did manage to get in a round of coffee, enjoy some cocktails in the lobby, eat in the pub and have breakfast in the formal dining room. 
My one complaint is that the AC in the room does not go below 19-Celsius, and doesn't even turn on the fan at that temperature. We ended up sleeping with the windows open and the room temp was fine...
Also, I want to move into the bathroom!",5,2018,08,07
217,Spa break!,"What a memorable visit my sister and I had at the fabulous hotel and spa in Powerscourt. On arrival, we were greeted with a upgrade and what was to follow was memorable! 

Beautiful food at the Sika restaurant, stunning grounds, impeccable customer service and a suite that we will never forget! 

Another excellent positive was the hotels ability to cater for coeliac diners. It made life so much easier for my sister. A fabulous mid week trip that will definitely be repeated in the near future! ⭐️⭐️⭐️⭐️⭐️",5,2018,08,07
217,Stunning hotel,"Visited here with my husband for 1 night. Absolutely stunning, both hotel and surroundings. Expensive for hotel itself however dinner in either restaurants quite reasonable. Picturesque gardens, loads to do.",5,2018,08,07
217,Beautiful Traditional Hotel,"My husband and I stayed at Powerscourt Hotel for our first night in the Republic of Ireland.  We took the ferry to Holyhead from London and then a tray out to Bray.  We had a very spacious room with a beautiful view.  The bathroom was spectacular with two sinks, a deep tub, and a shower in addition to a privacy toilet.  The lobby of this hotel is also beautiful.  We did not eat at the restaurant, but ate at the put instead.  The pub food was good and since the World Cup was on it was a friendly crowd.  This hotel is worth visiting if only for one night.",5,2018,08,06
217,Excellent Hotel,"Great hotel, we loved the Gardens and shops/Avoca which were a few minutes walk away from the hotel. We ate in the bar which was great, some Irish music would have been nice. The pool/spa area was good but full of kids which isn't ideal.",5,2018,08,06
217,Attentive staff- Great service ,"Myself and my wife visited the hotel for lunch yesterday. This hotel is a real gem and is truly worthy of 5 stars. We were served by Kayleigh & Keith. Both of the guys have exceptional customer service & genuine conversation. Keith who is a manager observed that my wife was heavily pregnant,  when he heard we had only 2 weeks to go, he sent a specially made non alcoholic drink to my wife and a glass of champagne to me, with a message of congratulations. This is truly going that extra mile and I applaud Keith and the hotel for making our lunch so special. Thank you so much, it’s one we won’t forget. The food was delicious , I had seafood chowder and my wife had tomato soup, both cooked and tasting wonderfully. We shared a cobb salad and fries. Again very tasty and well thought out. We look forward to being back with the baby. Thank you. ",5,2018,08,05
217,Outstanding ,"This is a great hotel in a great location. You can see that it was formerly a Ritz Carlton in particular with the large bedrooms and beautiful bathrooms - which are top class. Great breakfast, helpful staff, beautiful outlooks and lots to do nearby make this a must stay for both international visitors and locals treating themselves. Proper 5 star.",5,2018,08,05
217,Amazing!,"Highly recommend, amazing staff, so clean, quiet and relaxing! Food was amazing all around, breakfast at Sika, lunch or tea at sugarloaf lounge or dinner at the pub insite was fabulous! Was able to check in early thankfully as our flight got in early and the staff was so helpful with the process and any questions we had during our stay!! Highly recommend and would return in a heartbeat!",5,2018,08,03
217,"beautiful location, brilliant service, delicious afternoon tea & breakfast","when we arrived we were really impressed by the exterior of the hotel, we stayed in a suite, it was just beautiful, toilet & the living room area and the bedroom area. the suite has a big balcony, just a beautiful hotel, we enjoyed it very much, bed was very comfy, we cant wait to visit again soon.  we also made use of the swimming pool area, i cant remember if there was a sauna or not because i was pregnant. there was bicycles available for hire for cycling around the resort too. pity it was quite cold and was raining but we did do a short walk around the hotel.",5,2018,08,01
217,amazing,"I stayed at powers court for a wedding being held in the hotel. It was the most wonderful location, staff were friendly, polite and helpful. 

Fantastic memories of the weekend spent here. Our room was beautiful and spotlessly clean.",5,2018,08,01
217,Much more than expected.,"Everyone should spend at least one night in this hotel because they know how to treat you. The place is beautiful, with first class furnishings throughout the common areas and in the rooms, and everything in those rooms, from bed linen to towels to mirrors indicate much thought and care in selection. This is physically one of the most attractive hotels I have checked into.
   The staff are what raise this place from very good to excellent. From the cheery top hatted doorman to the smiling front desk clerk and everyone you encounter after that seems determined to make your stay the best. Their training must be extensive and they seem to love their job. Our only disappointment was that we could only stay one day before moving on. I guess I'll just have to go back..",5,2018,08,01
217,A very special birthday weekend!,"We were invited to join in a family birthday celebration for Saturday night Dinner B& B. So we, a family of 10 including two children 7 and 13, all booked for the Friday as well. I cannot tell you how much I loved my room. The view of the Sugar Loaf and gardens was stunning with the morning and evening light. The room itself was so spacious and well appointed, I really regretted having to leave on Sunday.  The first night we had a fun dinner in the bar. The food was great and the staff excellent. On the Saturday, after a lovely breakfast, some of us wanted to go over to the old house for a look around, but it was pouring. The concierge saw our plight and immediately arranged for the five of us to be driven over to the house, with the admonishment that we must be sure to give him a call when we needed to return to the hotel. How is that for customer care!  Poor Powerscourt is a pity. I remember the fire that ravaged it way back when. However, Avoca have done a great job of providing an interesting retail space and cafe. We loved the little museum too.  The gardens and the Garden Centre were out of bounds for us with the downpour.  We had a lovely dinner that night in the Sika Restaurant. We had such family fun and the food was lovely. I went down in the morning to the pool. It was such a zen moment with the soothing music. Loved it.  Altogether it was a weekend of wonderful experiences and memories. I returned a few weeks later to see the Garden Centre with a cousin. We had a super lunch in the Bistro overlooking that fabulous view. Can’t wait to return.",5,2018,07,31
217,Conference,"I always look forward to staying at Powerscourt hotel at an annual conference.

The hotel itself, bedrooms, location and views are truly among the best I've seen in hotels across 32 different countries worldwide.

The only issue we always have here is that the staff, although friendly, aren't quite up to 5 Star standard on effectiveness. Too often does it need several members of staff to meet basic requests like tea and coffee at breakfast or drinks at dinner. 

It's a small issue but one that truly holds this hotel back from it's 5 Star competitors across Ireland. 

Always looking forward to my next stay!",5,2018,07,31
217,Spectacular views ,Powerscourt is simply stunning. The views are amazing the gardens are amazing and the hotel is amazing. If you are having a meal or just a drink you are treated so well by all the staff. The bedrooms are very big and the spa and pool area is so relaxing. Definitely the way to treat yourself. ,5,2018,07,31
217,The best ever!,"We cannot rate this hotel highly enough. Truly exceptional in every way. 
The grounds are just exquisite with plenty of places to visit, and a short drive from Dublin. The hotel even has complimentary underground parking.
The hotel decor is just pure elegance and the hotel smells divine throughout.
As a Marriott reward member, we did receive a very welcome upgrade, and wow, what a room! The space was very well thought out, and all your needs are catered for. The coffee machine is state of the art, as is the touch control panels operated through an in room tablet. We also had a wonderful large balcony, that despite the rain was a very nice addition! 
Also, every single surface was beyond spotless, every single corner was gleaming. I am not sure how housekeeping manage this as the room is so big, but they must be truly commended.
The spa is also a highlight of our stay, and Espa products are also provided in the room, so pure luxury!
I should also mention the cocktails in the lounge bar, also are of an extremely high standard, the maple old fashioned being a favourite! 
The food in Sika restaurant is up there with any Michelin star rating. Highly recommend.
However what makes this hotel stand out is the polite, courteous and extremely efficient service, which is probably one of the best we have ever experienced in any hotel. All the staff were warm, friendly and attentive and an absolute credit to the hotel.
We are already looking to return which is truly the best compliment we can give.",5,2018,07,31
217,Truly five star.,"This hotel is exceptional in all ways. Huge rooms , well appointed, adequate parking , knowledgeable friendly staff and good in every way.

I did not opt for the €28 breakfast however since that’s on the high side for me who frequently skips it. 

The food served at our meetings and dinners was uniformly outstanding. 

A very nice experience overall and close to the motorway and a short drive to Dublin. ",5,2018,07,30
217,Lovely Property,"Received a lovely upgrade as Marriott Platinum to a suite.  Super comfortable bed and very spacious abode.

The spa was lovely and fairly priced for a five star hotel.  

The location is nice in that it's good for seeing outside the city but it is not convenient, particularly as uber doesn't really exist in Dublin.

Breakfast buffet was lovely and service pretty good given that it was so busy (i.e. not a relaxing experience)

The hotel did scream of being understaffed though.  The front desk had only one person serving on the Saturday I was there and it wasn't enough for the queues that were continuously forming.  In addition the concierge desk was never manned during the weekend I was there which was quite frustrating given you couldn't just nip over to the front desk for information given the aforementioned capacity issues there.  In addition they had a staff member on training who while very pleasant, was not skilled up enough on knowledge to be customer facing yet and a young man from the bell desk team studiously ignored me while I was waiting for God at the concierge desk not knowing at that point that it was an unmanned station.  If you're not trained to answer concierge questions, no issue but at least approach guests standing somewhere unbeknownst to them for no reason and help direct them to someone who can help - this is an upscale hotel after all.

So in summary - hard product lovely but soft product could do with some work.
 
​",4,2018,07,30
217,A hidden gem!,"I stayed here with my friend recently and we both had a wonderful weekend. From the moment we arrived, all of the staff were welcoming, friendly, helpful and efficient. Our room was so comfortable, spacious and beautifully decorated with a stunning view of the countryside. We both had the Mindfulness massage in the spa which was so relaxing and calming. We ate in the Sika restaurant; each course was perfection. I had the best nights sleep after such a lovely day. Overall, we had a fabulous stay from start to finish and left feeling rejuvenated. Thank you.",5,2018,07,30
217,Lovely place,"I would give 4.5 stars if I could.  But this place should be 5 stars and is just not quite there.  There were issues with service that should not be occurring in a 5 star establishment.  And there was no cash machine at the hotel, nor anyplace around, which is quite a necessity.  

Our room was very spacious, and  meticulously appointed.  Rooms, hotel and grounds were lovely.  Breakfast was very good and included in our room rates.  We attended a conference and had a couple of meals and 3 receptions catered by the hotel as part of the conference.  Everything presented to us by way of food and drink was very good.  

The pool and hot tub are also very very nice.

However,  we had to call daily to have our room cleaned and tidied in a timely manner.  We understand that other guests who did not call had their rooms taken care of around 5 pm.  We had to call 3 times to get an ice bucket. Breakfast service of coffee, water and any orders for non buffet food took a long time as well.",4,2018,07,29
217,Luxurious stay with excellent ambience and top clas customer service.,"My stay stay a celebration of a 40th birthday, a retirement and a 94th birthday. Due to illness in the family, its aim was to make memories. From the moment we arrived, the 7 members of my family who had never been to Powescourt before were wowed. 

We had ESPA appointments the morning of arrival and had to change a few appointments around last minute, nothing was too much trouble or the spa staff. My gran is functional 94 yr old and she had a facial, the therapist who treated her was excellent, extremely patient and sensitive to her age. She also gave her a mini massage and my gran said she never felt so relaxed. Everyone was raving after the ESPA experience before even checking in.

We had a lovely lunch in Mc Gills, then all checked into our suites which were as fabulous as always. The luxury, the space. the comfor and the views were brilliant for first time guests. Dinner in Sika was really lovely, the food, views and service were top class. Breakfast on the terrace the next morning equally as commendable.

Every staff member encountered couldn't have been more helpful and we had a truly memorable stay.

A special note to 2 girls at reception who were both training in, I had a few small requests and they were both excellent in helping our stay run smoother.
Thank you for a wonderful stay.",5,2018,07,28
217,Fantastic Visit,"My husband had a conference at the Powerscourt Hotel.  We extended our stay, and had a most amazing vacation.  The property is astonishing, and well kept.  The rooms have many amenities, including large bathrooms and a wardrobe area.  The restaurant and breakfast were delicious, and most important - the service was outstanding.  Certainly made for a wonderful vacation!",5,2018,07,27
217,Amazing stay,"We stayed at the hotel for 3 nights and our expectations were exceeded throughout the whole stay. I planned a birthday surprise for my partner and with the tremendous help of Lezette Ketley, my vision came to life. She was really responsive, genuine and helpful. The team did an amazing job setting up the room with balloons and personal notes.
The room we had was absolutely gorgeous, housekeeping team did a great job! One night the TV was not working anymore and we had a gentleman coming to fix it quickly. Every day the breakfast was really good. We truly enjoyed the Sika restaurant and the food. Special thanks to Cristian Teaca, who was really welcoming and attentive.

Thank you to the Powerscourt team for making our stay unforgettable! We`ll definitely stay there again if we go back to Ireland.

Additionally, the hotel has amazing views and surrounding. Definitely recommend a hike at the Glendalough lake (about one hour away).",5,2018,07,26
217,Great Customer Service ,"The room I had was great. I booked a standard room.  It came with a dressing room, living room, bed room and a bathroom that had a separate shower and bath tub.

The included breakfast (might have been included because I was with a group) was great. It puts buffets in American hotels to shame, both in the variety of choices and the healthy choices to eat.

The customer service went above and beyond anything anyone could expect.  As I was about to check in for my flight I thought I lost my passport. Just as I was about to start having to deal with the Embassy in Dublin I received an email that the hotel found my passport. I called them and they sent it to me in a taxi.  Because of that I was able to just make my flight. If they had not done that I would have had to spend the night and buy a new ticket home. Their actions save me well over $1,000.00. ",5,2018,07,26
217,Great Location,"We had a family holiday here for a week. 

Pros

Great property - so much space to enjoy and with the house just up the road.  The rooms are large with enough wardrobe space for a family of 10.....

Great location - close to Dublin and the airport (about 30 mins drive if no traffic) and the Wicklow mountains are a stone throw away. It’s also close to the motorway so you can be anywhere in the SE really easily. 

The staff were very friendly. The guy in charge of breakfast (sorry I am showing my age and have forgotten his name) was particularly kind.  

The food is pretty good. The breakfast buffet is pretty large and if you like a cooked Irish breakfast you’ll love it. Afternoon tea was good and the bar also does great food and they can bring it from other restaurants as well. 

Cons

The pool is only open to kids for a very limited time.  Not a huge issue but a bit of a shame for my 12 year old. 

The card keys for the room.  Jesus bloody Christ these are so annoying as they only work for a day or so and then you have to go back to reception and get them redone. Repeat almost every day.  

Reception is not very well staffed. Especially at night and particularly when you have to wait 20 mins to get your bloody key card fixed again to get into your room to watch the World Cup. 

But we’ll go back again. ",4,2018,07,24
217,Spectacular Hotel,"My wife and I decided to do something special for our 25th Wedding Anniversary so we booked the Powerscourt Hotel. It was quite a long drive for us but as it turned out, totally worth every mile of the journey. 

At check in the lady asked us if there was any special occasion why we were staying there and of course we mentioned the anniversary. Then without hesitation she upgraded us to a larger suite with a great view of the gardens / mountains. This was a really nice touch. In general I found the staff really friendly and they always made us feel special and very welcome.

Everything about the place exuded luxury. We also made good use of the spa and explored the grounds and gardens extensively. We were also lucky that the weather was excellent. The village of Enniskerry is also very beautiful and should be explored while staying at the Powerscourt.

I was really impressed with the style / architecture of the building. It was a product of the Irish property boom, completed right at the peak in 2007 and originally Ritz-Carlton owned. It went through some fiscally challenging times for the next 5 years, as did many similar establishments, but it is once again a highly successful and profitable hotel and one of the best in the country.

Highly recommended.",5,2018,07,23
217,5* Excellence,This is my 3rd time back to the hotel - can’t wait to plan my next visit! The hotel is luxurious but maintains a very relaxed and welcoming atmosphere. From the moment we arrived we were greeted with smiles from Reception staff and the concierges. The room was very spacious and meticulously prepared for our stay. ,5,2018,07,23
217,Wedding Anniversary,"My husband and I spent a night here at the beginning of the month to celebrate our wedding anniversary. We had booked a suite which was lavish and comfortable. The staff had nicely left chocolates and cards wishing us well on our anniversary which we thought was very nice.
We ate in the bar in the hotel, the menu was limited especially for a fussy eater like my other half. However we had no complaints with the food and staff were very helpful.
Breakfast the next morning was a buffet and included continental and cooked options and was very nice.
All in all a lovely stay in beautiful surroundings.
The only negative we found was the delay in check in. We arrived at 4pm, check in was 3pm however our room wasn't ready yet and we waited a further hour. This is a luxury hotel and is by no means cheap so you really do like to make the most of it. This delay really shouldn't have happened.",5,2018,07,22
217,We were hoping for much better,"Very impressive to start with, grand lobby, we also got upgraded to a bigger room, which was a beauty. We booked a spa treatment and it was great, but very pricey.
A lot of let down, and poor attention to detail.
TV wasn't working, we had to call someone. We were offered complimentary morning newspapers but never got them. Cheap fixtures, the bath tap turned were loose, TV in the bathroom was hard to get to work, the extraction fan worked in mysterious way.
Most of the 'swarovski' crystals lights in the swimming pool/steam room aren't working.
If you are on the 6th floor it's just about impossible to get 'the' lift that get you there (so you end up in the lobby in your bathrobe after the spa...).
And the 'ice rooms' absolutely revolting, see photo.
Hotel grounds are looking terrible.
Reading other reviews, it seems to have a complimentary bus service to the near village and free bike rental? We weren't made aware.
Food and drink offer, especially wine is poor.
There isn't much to do, pub only open at 6pm, why? 
River Walk is just a road with quite a few cars, nowhere to exercise apart from the gym.
Will not go back, not worth the money.",2,2018,07,20
217,A hotel to beat,"Wow. The hotel rooms and decor was only beaten by its service. Huge rooms, friendly staff, great atmosphere. The food was amazing and the staff were only too keen to ensure we enjoyed every moment. The amenities on offer were exceptional. There was a sauna, spa, pool, golf etc.",5,2018,07,20
217,Very nice but not a 10/10,"The hotel is really lovely & our room was perfect with fabulous views of The Sugarloaf. We had dinner in the McGills  bar, the food was nice but the bar itself is a let down. The decor is tired & needs a revamp in my opinion. It also really annoyed us that at 10pm there was children running around the bar making a lot of noise. Hotels like this need to enforce a policy of children having to leave the bar at a reasonable time. 
Breakfast was good but you need to get down early as there were queues for tables when we we leaving.
",4,2018,07,19
217,"Tremendous stay in a beautiful location, with phenomenal service","We booked three rooms at Powerscourt for a family vacation, including parents, grandparents (who live in Ireland), teenagers, and tweens. It's a *perfect* hotel for this kind of event! We wanted a location that had things to do in the surrounding area and sufficient amenities in the hotel that everything was easy and comfortable. Every one of us was glad to have stayed at the hotel. We've traveled in Ireland quite a bit, and Powerscourt ranks among the very best. 

We experienced a snafu for one room when checking in -- the ""guaranteed"" check-in time was 4pm but we only got in about 45 minutes later, after arriving much earlier in the day due to an early flight. The room we were given was above reception, facing the entrance driveway, which was not what we had expected, as we'd requested (and confirmed) a room closer to our teenagers' room. A quick phone call to reception yielded an apology and a swift change to one of the garden-facing rooms. If you can, book one of these for your stay; the garden is beautiful (even after the heat in Ireland this summer!), and makes for a very pleasant way to wake up in the morning.

The rooms are very well appointed. Bathrooms are sparkling; the shower is especially good, combining a rain head with hand-held attachment. One oddity is that the frosted glass door to the toilet area has an un-frosted clear ""frame"" in it. Personally, I like privacy in the bathroom, and this door didn't provide it! Easily managed, of course, but seems like a daft decision in an otherwise beautifully-designed bathroom.

The beds are very comfortable indeed, and our request for feather-free pillows and mattresses was handled without our even having to ask! There's also a separate closet area, with a safe, in each room. The in-room entertainment is high-tech, including AirPlay-compatible TV, and the hotel wifi is fast, easy-to-use, consistently excellent throughout the hotel, and free of irritating authentication pop-ups. The rooms also feature automation - lights and other features are controlled via a panel in a bedside drawer. Our system had a couple of issues on our first night, which were fixed by Housekeeping pretty much as soon as they were alerted to them.

Breakfast was included in our stay. This is a buffet-style breakfast, served in Sika, the fancy sit-down evening restaurant. Diners can also order an omelette and other egg-based dishes off a menu when being seated. It's a superb breakfast -- fruit, pastries, scones, the full Irish, and make-your-own-pancakes, plus coffee, tea, juices, and goodness knows what else. It fortified us for every day's adventure, the view is really lovely, and the service is attentive and efficient.

We also ate at McGill's Pub (also in the hotel), and liked it very much. The vegetarian choices are limited (gnocchi, fish and chips) but very very good. But it's not an Irish pub of the traditional kind, no matter how much dark wood they throw at it. On the main level is the Sugarloaf Lounge, where we enjoyed some evening drinks and seats looking out toward the gardens. One small regret is not having had afternoon tea in the Sugarloaf, as it looked both delicious and very relaxing.

Service at the hotel is excellent. We had the pleasure of getting help from Lezette and Robert, two of the concierges, and they were unfailingly excellent on each occasion, with great suggestions and apparently reveled in researching viable options for a large family meal (the task: find a restaurant that could sit 13 people, is wheelchair accessible, with nut-free vegetarian options, for the coming Friday night!). The staff at reception were also superb.

Housekeeping was on-point, eager to help, and very efficient every day. Our Nespresso machine had a small problem; it was swapped out that day. We requested extra still water; delivered to our door (respecting the Do Not Disturb sign) within 30 minutes. It's true that, once or twice, we encountered a new member of staff who didn't quite know how to help, but our requests and needs were always met in a timely fashion, and always with a smile.

We visited the hotel pool twice. They have kid-friendly hours in the morning and mid-afternoon, so our whole family could enjoy it together. At other times, it is a quiet, calm sanctuary, with a large hot spa and beautifully-lit main pool. It's attached to the hotel spa and gym, too.

Finally, the grounds are lovely and, as the hotel is just down the road from Powerscourt House (with one of the top 10 gardens in the world, according to NatGeo), the possible walks and views are wonderful. There's also a golf course across the road, which guests can play.

County Wicklow is truly the Garden of Ireland, and Powerscourt Hotel is surely the best hotel available in the area. Should we ever visit the area again, it will be hard to imagine our staying anywhere other than Powerscourt.",5,2018,07,18
217,Amazing Hotel!,"It is probably about 10 years since we last stayed here.  Our previous memories of the place were probably a bit cold and unfriendly, and a little lacking in atmosphere.  The minute we walked over to reception we knew the hotel had changed.  The lobby area has now lovely couches, and plush armchairs, which you are welcome to sit at without having to buy a drink or coffee.  We had a lovely friendly welcome by the receptionist.  We were upgraded to the most amazing suite with its own balcony and large sitting area.  It had its own hallway, walk-in wardrobe and very plush bathroom. We were going to a concert that evening and really didn't want to leave the hotel. The next morning we had breakfast outside on the terrace which was gorgeous.  The spa and swimming pool were also lovely, with Espa products in the changing rooms. 
When we returned from the concert we were disappointed that a turndown hadn't been done.  Apparently you have to request this.  We went to have a drink in the bar but the air-conditioning was turned on so high that we couldn't sit in it and took our drinks upstairs to the lobby. These were the only very minor negatives in an amazing stay.  If we are going to Dublin and surrounding area again we would definitely stay here.  It is our new favourite hotel and we cannot wait to return.",5,2018,07,18
217,Very Nice Stay,"After travelling through Ireland over 2 weeks and reflecting back, this hotel was definitely one of the nicest places to stay.  You realize you only need a few things to make a stay memorable but this place had a very nice property, nice service and good food.  What else can you ask for?  Simple but not everyone can do it.",5,2018,07,17
217,The finest of luxury,"The absolute top of the line as far as rooms, grounds, service, food, food options, etc.  The room was spacious and comfortable.  Turndown service every night complete with bottled water and a homemade cake.  Every time we saw a staff member in the hall they would ask what they could do to make our stay better.  We were visiting for a wedding and had a spectacular time.  Highly recommend.  ",5,2018,07,16
217,5 star setting - 3 star service,The setting is amazing. However there are a number of areas that need attention. The housekeeping in the general public areas is very poor. I brought it to the attention of 3 staff/managers and the general manager however it didn’t improve over the 3 days we spent at the hotel. When you pay for a 5 star hotel you expect 5 star. Our room was lovely and the views were fantastic. Breakfast was ok. Service slow. As we were celebrating our Silver Wedding Anniversary we decided we would dine in the restaurant on one of the nights. I can not recommend the steak it was awful. Disappointing and overpriced is an understatement. The changing rooms in the pool area could have been cleaner. ,3,2018,07,15
217,Amazing Hotel!,"Have stayed here a couple of times a year, continuously over the past couple of years. Amazing hotel and service is always above and beyond. Tip before check out, make sure to always check your bill before paying as there has always been an additional random item added. However, staff are always understanding and happy to remove.",5,2018,07,14
217,Wonderful Stay,Had the pleasure of staying here recently. Fab spacious room. Everything feels very luxurious. The spa is fabulous with wonderful staff. The only small criticism I have is the service at dinner in Sika was a little unorganised but the food made up for this. I look forward to staying here again.,5,2018,07,12
217,"Beautiful hotel with large, classy rooms!","The rooms here were so clean, beautifully designed, comfortable beds, and the porch was great for morning coffee overlooking the mountain! The service was great, and the restaurants had good food. By the time we checked in, the main dining restaurant was full for reservations for the evening, but we did grab breakfast there. The only thing I didn't like about this hotel was that there were no outlets in the bathroom to plug in a curling iron/straightener. The blowdryer was affixed to the wall, but I needed to curl my hair that day and had to get creative.",5,2018,07,11
217,"Lovely hotel, excellent service, very close to two golf courses","We stayed at this lovely hotel for the third consecutive year to play golf at two nearby courses. In addition to the dry and sunny weather we enjoyed perfect accommodation (one-bedroom suite), very good Irish food as well as excellent concierge services (Head concierge Robert Smyth). The Powerscourt Golf Club has two wonderful courses (East and West), very friendly and helpful management at the club house. We already look forward to go to Ireland next year (the same hotel, the same golf course, the same dry summer season).",5,2018,07,09
217,Definitely not disappointed ,"Was our first stop on a tour round Ireland and purposely so as I’ve always wanted To stay here. Wow what can I say. The room was impressive- cocktails in the bar were amazing - food both evening meal and breakfast were lovely. 
Grounds are stunning - if I had to say one thing though is that the undercover car park is actually so dirty - full of debris and rubbish. Such a shame as that isn’t reflected anywhere else. It’s the first thing we saw and the last thing we saw on leaving the hotel - it’s been so dry and not windy in Ireland for the past month so it’s not as if debris has been blown there by the elements.  Minor aspect but in a five star hotel you expect even the car park to be clean.  ",5,2018,07,07
217,Beautiful View and great food!,We stayed in a suite with a view of the gardens. The room was beautiful and very clean. The bed was extra comfortable and they did everything to upgrade us. The spa is so beautiful I wish we would have used it. I highly recommend eating breakfast there as well as dinner.,5,2018,07,07
217,Very lovely rooms,"We stayed in this hotel for 8 days and I cannot recommend it. The surrounding area is very nice and certainly worth a visit and our accommodations were absolutely gorgeous. However, after a very disappointing problem with the concierge, we spent as little time at the hotel as possible so I cannot comment on any amenities or services offered there.",3,2018,07,06
217,"Amazing stay, beautiful rooms, unbelievable staff. Blown away!!","Myself and my partner were contemplating where to stay as a nice getaway - and safe to say we most definitely chose the right hotel! From the minute we arrived until we left we felt like royalty, we were taken care of and looked after so well. Receptionist was very warm and welcoming (I regret that I cannot remember her name) Firstly the rooms and the grounds are unbelievable and we had such great weather which made our visit to the house and gardens very worthwhile. Rooms were very comfortable and spacious and we had a lovely view of the Sugarloaf Mountain. Speaking of which. we had a lovely waitress called Kayleigh who I cannot forget to give a special mention to as she looked after us so well in the sugarloaf lounge. Nothing was too much of an effort, very friendly and chatty and she was very attentive. She even brought out a happy birthday plate after overhearing us talk about my birthday which was very sweet. All staff looked very happy in what they were doing. Also went to Mcguills pub for a drink or a few too many and the staff were so lovely. The live music was very entertaining. To sum it up all staff are very well trained in their areas and it has a massive impact on our stay and we will definitely be returning. Keep doing what youre doing this is what its all about!",5,2018,07,05
217,10/10,The Powerscourt Hotel has been a favourite of mine for years. Recently I visited the Sugar Loaf Lounge with my boyfriend and we were greeted by an amazing bar team who looked after us kindly and professionally. We both would like to extend a particular thanks to Katie who had an exceptionally hospitable air. 10/10 as always.,5,2018,07,03
217,Quality residence,"Stayed here as had a conference in Dun Laoghaire which is just short spin up the road.
Very impressed with the standard of accomodation and service here. Room was quality in every way. Beautiful part of the world as well.
Enjoyed a nice meal and couple of drinks in the bar that evening. Staff were very pleasant and helpful.
Looking forward to return visit soon.",5,2018,07,01
217,Great Stay. Beautiful Room and Surroundings ,"We spent two wonderful nights at Powerscourt. It was about a half hour trip by cab from Dublin. 

The hotel itself is gorgeous. Huge expanse of grass and trees out back, and secluded gardens out front. It sits on something like a 1000 acre estate. An easy walk to Powerscourt House and Gardens, which are not to be missed. 

The room was fabulous. Large bedroom off a spacious living area. Both had floor to ceiling glass opening into the garden areas. The folks on the other side of the hotel would have seen enormous expanses of grass, trees, and the beautiful fountain. I actually preferred our garden view. A few signs of wear, but nothing that will detract from your stay. 

Very high end room with luxurious bathroom, and one of the best features I’ve seen in any hotel: a large “luggage room” with closets. The space was opposite the bathroom right inside the front door. Perhaps 10x10 feet with closets on both sides. Finding a place for your suitcases was zero trouble. Closets were big with lots of room to hang things up. Excellent. 

Bedroom was luxurious and comfortable. Quiet. Comfortable bed. Nice linens. Great bathroom. Plenty of outlets.

Service was friendly and efficient. Dining room was very nice. Great dinner, though our captain was a bit sluggish and ended up comping a few things because he realized we’d waited unacceptably for a few things. Overall, good.

Desk folks were very nice. Door and bell staff as well. Having a pint or two in the beautiful lobby / lounge will definitely put you in the Irish spirit. 

You’ll have a great day at the house and gardens next door. Don’t miss them. Modest charge to get in. Bring your camera. Also a huge gorgeous golf course in easy reach. Enniskerry is a charming, very small town that you can easily reach with the help of the hotel shuttle. A couple of pubs and beautiful walks in any direction. Nice people. Classic Ireland. 

Overall: beautiful hotel, great staff, good food, gorgeous surroundings. If you’re in Dublin and wondering about your next step, Powerscourt is an absolute no-brainer. I’d definitely return.",4,2018,06,30
217,A lovely way to finish our time in Ireland and so convenient to the airport.,"We choose to stay at Powerscourt as it is only a 35-40 minute drive to Dublin airport and is a lovely and convenient way to finish your holiday. Well it is that length of time if you have an early flight which we generally do, not sure how long later in the day.
Arriving at Powerscourt you are greeted and assisted with luggage. Sometimes the check in can be a bit long but on this occasion it was brilliant. 
Our rooms were just stunning with views right over the Wicklow mountains and Sugarloaf Mountain. 
The rooms are lovely and quiet and every need is catered for. the bathrooms could hold a dance party and are so very luxurious. 
We dined in our room one night and because we were leaving at 5.30am and wanted an early night, we had a quick bite to eat at McGills Pub. The food was not brilliant but the service was good. I dont think older people would appreciate the vibe as much as young people do at this pub but it was a good bit of fun.
Our early morning checkout was seamless. Our luggage collected by an extremely efficient and well humoured man who was doing both the checkouts and also helped with the luggage. He was really pleasant and very professional. As I had finalized the bill the night before it was just a cheery good bye and we sailed down to the airport.",5,2018,06,29
217,SIX stars!,"We had an amazing experience at Powerscourt. Everything was perfect - and I can be very critical. The staff was outstanding🌟. Magdalena at Sika for breakfast was incredibly friendly and a wonderful hostess. No sooner had I asked about the delicious breakfast breads, and she had scones ready for me to take for a snack. That kind of thoughtfulness  is practically nonexistent, even in the best hotels.  But then we had a great experience in the pub with our charming waiter. And staff at the front desk was great. The room was spacious, the lobby is stunning. Elderflower water at the entry was a nice touch on a hot Irish day. And the flowers in the lobby were beautiful. I don’t think I have had a better hotel experience- and we have stayed at many lovely places over the years. What a welcome to Ireland!",5,2018,06,29
217,"Beautiful environment, excellent service.","It was a lovely sunny day so we headed to Powerscourt for some light lunch.
The hotel is quite low key on approach, as it is in a valley off the driveway to historic 1731 Powerscourt House.
The staff were very helpful in directing us to the part of the hotel where our needs would be best met.
The loom was lovely with a relatively low decorative plaster ceiling. the walls were lined in timber panelling. We sat at a window overlooking the hotel's fountains and hills beyond.  
It was a beautiful experience.",5,2018,06,29
217,Impressive !,"The hotel is impressive! Really enjoyed the breakfast, spa, cycling to Enniskerry (hotel has bikes available for guests).

Look forward to visiting again...

My only advice: 
1. is to coach your teams to be more engaging to guests. Reception team were not your average Marriott crew.
2. TV in bedroom didn’t work.
3. The pool area was dangerously slippery during my visit.",4,2018,06,28
217,Only One Description,"Perfect in every way! A hidden gem on the Emerald Isle! Service, scenery, food, room,property is like a fairy tale. South of Dublin, worth the gorgeous drive. Don’t come to Ireland without staying here!!",5,2018,06,27
217,Disappointing service for afternoon tea ,"Special treat for my daughters birthday. This was our second time in the Sugar Loaf Bar for afternoon tea. The setting was lovely the table layout also lovely. Food very good .. service for the first 20 min excellent then we had to ask at least 3 different staff  for more teas & coffee. Had to ask for more butter, cream etc . Have to say I was rather disappointed with the overall service. My daughter did get the Happy Birthday treat. They also didn’t do the separate desserts that we had on our first visit. It’s a 5 star setting, 5 star food ,however 2/3 star service this time. Also it’s €39 pp so not on the cheap side!!! ",3,2018,06,27
217,"Beautiful Setting, Lovely Rooms, Some Details Lacking","When you arrive from the US and you are ready for a vacation, it is sometimes hard to land in a city, even one so lovely as Dublin. We decided instead to spend two nights at the foothills in a world of its own, Powerscourt. The  hotel is lovely with a tasteful lobby and many fine places to enjoy the views and solitude. Our room was spacious and comfortable and we slept well. It has wonderful places to walk and is only a 7 minute walk to the phenomenal Powerscourt gardens, not to be missed. The food in the Sika restaurant is beautifully presented and delicious. Overall, the young staff were friendly and did their best to ensure that you felt welcome.  So, which details were lacking? We booked a taxi to take us to the train two days ahead of time which it turned out was never booked, so we nearly missed our train. The bell staff helped us make the train in time, but the concierge had not followed through on a simple request. The bedside lamp was broken when we arrived and we requested a repair but it was still broken two days later. The coffee pods for the Nespresso machine were defective so kept falling through. The bottom line is that this is a really beautiful location, and a very nice hotel. We were glad that we stayed there. But with travel, it is all about the details, and some details still need attention. Otherwise, I would have given it 5 stars.",4,2018,06,24
217,Good stay with a few shortcomings,"We stayed at this property before and loved it. This stay was mostly good with a few shortcomings that I believe management should take care of. 
We didn’t have any bathroom amenities (shampoo, conditioner and body wash) in our room upon arrival. I made a request through the app but several hours later the amenities still hadn’t appeared. I eventually called housekeeping and then apologized, mentioned they had seen the request on the app but since we were not in the room they couldn’t drop off the amenities??

We had an evening reservation for dinner in Enniskerry and called to enquire how the complimentary shuttle worked. We were told to be at reception 15 minutes to the hour and the shuttle would take us where we needed to go on the hour. We checked in the the bellhop 15 minutes prior to 6pm who acknowledged our request. We witnessed another party be escorted to the shuttle and whisked off in front of us despite the fact that they appeared at the front desk 10 minutes after us. There seemed to have been a change in staff with the bellhop and the replacement staff told us to just wait. It was 20 minutes past the hour at this stage and we were already late for our 6.15pm reservation. We decided to call a taxi but it left me rather upset about how the shuttle was unreliable and how the staff didn’t really make any apologies about the fact that we were left just waiting without any explanation as to why the other party were provided with the shuttle ahead of us. 

Generally I found the staff “ok” but definitely not what is expected from a 5* Hotel. Saying that, this morning upon check out we had lovely assistance from a gentleman who brought us coffee, pastries and water before we left (early arrival meant we didn’t make breakfast). 

I’m not sure we’d return. The hotel somehow lacks an Irish welcome and the “warmth” one expects when visiting Ireland. ",4,2018,06,24
217,Fantastic Location- what views!,"Fantastic room - so much space - pure luxury - got upgraded to a suite - every luxury you would expect. Loved the shower and very large bathroom. Views from every room. Fine dining in the Sika Restaurant. Great Traditional Bar too. If you can do a visit to Powerscourt next door, you should - the garden are world class. ",4,2018,06,23
217,Love!,This is my third year visiting Powerscourt and it is by far the best hotel I have ever stayed at. Everyone is so friendly and inviting. The Sika restaurant is amazing and Nermina was a delight to interact with everyday. The staff is so nice. There’s plenty to do around the grounds and it made my Ireland stay perfect!,5,2018,06,22
217,Stunning,"We stayed here for only one night but it was wonderful. Beautiful hotel, amazing location, stunning interiors. Staff and food were fantastic. Wish we could have stayed longer.
Will be back in a heartbeat.",5,2018,06,20
217,Afternoon tea Delight,"Received a gift of Afternoon tea. Absolutely fantastic experience, I was a bit apprehensive to go as i thought i would be starving afterwards & that it was only fr a more refined pallet but i was pleasantly surprised how filling 7 tasty everything.

So much effort has gone into every detail of everything you eat. 

At the end of the day it is very pricey for what it is, but for the surroundings, experience & view you get on a nice day It is the perfect treat for a Loved one",5,2018,06,19
217,Beautiful stay,"We had traveled all over Scotland and Ireland by the time we landed at Powerscourt. I adore B&B's, but it was SO nice to have everything right there at hand. Our room was very spacious and I appreciated all of the added touches. We ordered room service that evening, as we were tired from driving. Our meal was delicious and served very promptly. We walked the grounds afterward and they were stunning. Horses grazing on the property were a nice touch. Brunch the following morning was very well done and we had no problem being seated and served.",5,2018,06,18
217,Stunning Property requiring some additional maintenance investment  ,"We stayed here on a Marriott reward redemption which makes it excellence value for money. The hotel reception is stunning and the patio view over the sugar loaf is gorgeous and makes the hotel especially on a sunny day.

The staff are very friendly and willing to help out where they can but there is just a lack of pro active maintenance around the hotel itself. A few examples the roof of the pool has mould, damp spots and the paths around the hotel have fallen down signs or missing steps, rust. 

If the hotel takes a few Months and invests in this the place will be stunning as the view and the grounds are great.

",3,2018,06,17
217,Fantastic property ok service,"We stayed for two nights and really enjoyed the room, grounds and the amenities.  I am a platinum elite and we had a nice balcony room on the third floor near Silca.  The spa area was very nice and the staff friendly.

My biggest issue was the lack of extra effort.  The breakfast was very unorganized both days.  We tried to have lunch upon our arrival and there were clearly open tables the host asked if we had reservations which we did not and acted put out to find us a table,  We ended up going into Enniskerry for lunch.

They offer a ride service at the top of every hour into town but the return pickup was very spotty.we walked back after our lunch even though we called with a 20 min notice and then another call 15 min after they should have met us  

The pub was nice to watch the World Cup that was a nice evening but nothing grand.

It is a short walk to the gardens and the Powerscourt estate which is lovely to walk and enjoy

We stayed on Marriot points so our investment was small. We would have liked to eat on grounds but we underestimated the need for reservations for lunches and dinners

The staff was friendly but either under staffed or busy with others

Would I return probably not",4,2018,06,16
217,One of my favourites,I stayed again at Powerscourt Hotel and it did not disappoint! Fab hotel with beautiful views and food! Staff were very friendly and we thoroughly enjoyed our night away. Can't wait to visit again soon,5,2018,06,16
217,Wow wee whoo wee!,"That was my granny anny’s expression for anything that was superlative and the Powerscourt Hotel is simply the best in every way.

The gardens and views of the Wicklow mountains are gorgeous. Our suite was out of this world spacious and the bed was tough to leave in the morning. We ate in all three of the restaurants and each meal was delicious.  I enjoyed the spa one day and the treatment was one of the best I have ever experienced.

I can’t say enough about the personnel at this hotel. We all know how staff can make or break a stay. From the door gentleman and lady, reception, hostess and servers in restaurant, concierge services and housekeepers  / all went above and beyond to accommodate any request and make you feel very welcomed indeed.

I tip my hat to management for running one of the nicest resorts I have ever stayed in and I hope to return for more Irish hospitality and recommend all to go and see for themselves.",5,2018,06,15
217,Incredible Hotel with Beautiful surroundings ,"This was an incredibly peaceful experience in a luxury hotel! 

The breakfast was unreal and absolutely loved it! 

The main courses had limited vegetarian options and no vegan options. Aside from the breakfast, the food is quite average compared to the overall amazing experience!

I honestly haven’t had a better hotel experience and still tempted to give 5* but that food was not great at all!

Would I go back? 100%",4,2018,06,14
217,Fabulous Property!,Stayed here on points while travelling through...  delighted to receive a complimentary upgrade to a suite!  Staff is extremely accommodating and the location very convenient to Powerscourt Gardens.    On-site pub is good and the views are great!!!,5,2018,06,14
217,Amazing!,"Spent a beautiful weekend at the Powerscourt hotel last month. From check in until check out my fiancé and I had the best time. 
Our room had an amazing view of the sugar loaf mountain. The room was huge, a true five star hotel room. The furnishings were beautiful. My partner loved that it had a nespresso machine for his morning coffee instead of the terrible instant sachets that are in most hotels!
We ate in the restaurant on Saturday night and it was great. Beautiful meal with fabulous wine. 
We ordered a picnic that was freshly prepared by the kitchen and brought it into the forest/woods. It was gorgeous! Especially the champagne.
Overall we had an amazing weekend. We will definitely back!",5,2018,06,14
217,Almost Five Stars!,"My wife and I stayed in this property during our 40th anniversary celebration trip. This hotel is extremely nice. We are a Marriott Platinum Elite member so we were upgraded to a fantastic two bedroom suite----one of the best rooms ever---really fantastic. The location and overall appearance of the hotel is excellent as well. Powerscourt gardens and golf courses are really nice. Though you are not far from the city you feel very far away. The area in the Wicklow mountains is also gorgeous. Weekends do get busy at this property. The only problems with the hotel are in regard to the service and team. This property is simply not there with their staff in being a 5 star. The concierge was never at his/her post. We waited two or three times and they never came. The breakfast staff really struggled. Breakfast is more like a cheaper hotel buffet than a high end Irish property---it just doesn't compare with the nicer Irish properties. Things were chaotic, food bar was not well cared for, staff was slow and sloppy, management fairly unresponsive, etc. Restaurants and food overall was not as strong as the property is otherwise. This was a pull down on the property and affected my ratings. The spa area is fantastic with a great sauna, steam room, pool, etc. I would stay here again and hope the staff and restaurant experience gets better.",4,2018,06,13
217,Poor poor service ,"I returned to this Hotel after staying there several times a few years ago. On this occasion the whole family booked in for a long weekend to celebrate my birthday. 
Although the Hotel amenities are of a good, not outstanding quality I might add the SERVICE in this Hotel was horrendous, non-existing and borderline arrogant. 

The waiting staff in the Hotel Bar and foyer area seemed to be untrained and gave you the impression they quite frankly didn’t care and didn’t want to be there. Service was slow, orders were wrong and God forbid you question them on an order you made?! They are right...how dare you?

Service in the Sika Restaurant is mot much better. In fact, it was amateur and on par with a fast food eatery. No personality, slow and inattentive. 

Lastly, don’t try and order anything or request any extra shampoos or towels for your room (with kids you kind of need a few extra bits and pieces).....I guess the very young untrained staff are programmed to one thing and one thing only!

Sadly, this is a lovely setting for a Hotel but the whole experience was marred by poor poor service. There’s nothing further to say but think carefully before booking this Hotel if you want a true 5-star experience. It’s not just about the amenities and size of the rooms, after all......
",1,2018,06,13
217,Hotel has too high an opinion of itself - this is not a 5 star experience,"We had a 3 night stay at Powerscourt. Staff very willing but compromised by poor management - fine dining restaurant poorly organised and no a la carte menu, Hotel decided on two different nights to close two of its three food venues with no notice to customers. Customer relations manager couldn't even get our name right in his letter as he offered a discount to a future stay - for us the damage was done on a very expensive break to enjoy a very special occasion, so being invited to spend more to does not appeal.
Hotel rates itself 5 star, we have travelled widely and to many 5 star hotels, we would rate the hotel 4 star at best overall with a disappointing 3 star for its catering and 1 star for customer consideration by the senior management.",2,2018,06,12
217,Disappointing hotel,"We recently stayed in The Powerscourt Hotel and we were very disappointed with it.
It can not be considered a 5 star hotel. The service was generally not very good.
It did not supply the usual bathroom supplies ie shampoo, shower gels only a tablet of soap. The McGills bar is very dull and uninviting. The hotel lacks charm.",3,2018,06,11
217,Wonderful Stay,"We had 2 different rooms in our party - one suite and one standard room. Both rooms were very spacious and comfortable.  Upon check-in, the manager gave us a little run down on the hotel and where to find things which I thought was a nice touch. Breakfast at the hotel has pretty much anything you could want and more. Restaurant on main floor also had a great menu with amazing cocktails. Would highly recommend staying here.",5,2018,06,11
217,Relaxing ,Had nice relaxing stay here for a couple of nights. Ate in the different restaurants each day and night and the breakfast was lovely. Pool and spa area is very nice also. The beef burger in McGills was really good. There is also a lovely walk for the guests along the riverfront. Bedroom and bathroom both well designed. ,5,2018,06,07
217,Another Wonderful Visit,"My husband and I stayed at Powerscourt for 16 nights this spring.  Powerscourt is probably our favorite hotel in the world.  Upon our arrival, we were greeted by Paul, the front desk manager and Katie. Paul is to be commended.  He is always open to requests for room availability, future reservations and any other requests.   Our room was almost ready but in the meantime Katie was so kind and brought us tea, coffee, and cookies.  
The bellman, Tatoo delivered our bags to our room when it was ready,, got us ice and made sure everything was in order.  He was as polite and helpful as could be. Patrick, one of the other bellman was as helpful, advising us on some local sites we were not familiar with.  Another bellman, Kyle was always ready to be of assistance, whether it was for directions, information on sporting activities, or other general information.
We ate regularly in the pub, McGills.  The food is good and the wait staff very friendly.  Ian was especially accommodating and was able to make a special request possible.  
Robbie,one of the managers was another one of the excellent staff members at Powerscourt.  Robbie is very visible, helpful, and wants to make sure that each guest is enjoying themselves.
The suite we had was comfortable, spacious, and well decorated. It was a pleasure to sit outside on the patio and enjoy the spectacular view.  
We are anxious to return next spring.  We feel at home when we visit and the staff is part of the reason we feel that way.",5,2018,06,06
217,Outstanding,"I’ve been lucky enough to visit here a couple of times for various occasions- in January my partner brought me here after we got engaged and I will never forget it. I think I was in shock the whole time I was here but the staff really made it feel extra special on that occasion. I’m not certain what room we had but it was enormous- there was a little sitting area within the room and all round it was really spectacular. It’s certainly a little bit of luxury encased within the beautiful, mountainous Wicklow landscape.",5,2018,06,04
217,Fantastic ,"Powerscourt was amazing in every way possible! The lobby is huge and welcoming, the views are outstanding and the staff is top notch. The rooms were spacious and very well maintained. We played 18 holes at the golf course across the street and had an absolute blast! ",5,2018,06,03
217,Wonderful Stay -- Wish we had booked more than one night,We stayed one night here and absolutely loved everything about the hotel.  The rooms are large and the views are gorgeous.  The staff is wonderful.  We took the hotel car shuttle to the village for dinner and pickup was easy.  Had a fun night in the hotel pub--live Irish music playing.  Breakfast was great.  We toured the Powerscourt Estate Gardens and they are beautiful.  Wish we had stayed longer.  Beautiful hotel property.,5,2018,06,02
217,Great stay too bad it was only for one night ,"Fabulous hotel, the view is spectacular.
Be sure to take a walk around the gardens.
The view from the main lounge was beautiful.

We only stayed one night, will definitely stay longer if we get the opportunity.
The layout of the bathrooms are very well done.
The bedding and the linen we're extremely comfortable.

Loads of choice at breakfast and good selection of gluten free options. 

Kind of pricey in regards to drinks but overall a great stay! ",5,2018,05,31
217,"Amazing, again!","We recently stayed for 2 nights for a weekend get away.
One of my favourite places in Ireland, superb surroundings, luxury accomodation and such a relaxing atmosphere.
The staff were great again, the Spa is one of the best Iv'e visited, the gym facilities are perfect and the food is phenominal.
Incredible surroundings, do the river walk, wander up to Avoca for Cake and take a slow stroll through the trees. Mega relaxing thank you",5,2018,05,30
217,Delicious meal,"Arrived for lunch sat week. The food was superb. I had the salmon for my mains and a meringue dessert. The service was excellent, the food was hot and the staff were extremely helpful. A great night was had by all. ",5,2018,05,28
217,A luxery Hotel with amazing service and Staff,A Five Star hotel in a spectacular location.  Hotel Staff and Service probably the best I have encountered in Ireland.  Had A suite with amazing views and attention to detail was spot on.  Spa was fabulous and again staff excellent.  Dinner in the dining Room was excellent with great menu lovely setting. For us it was the little touches that made this experience so memorable and The Powerscourt hotel is a 5 star Irish Hotel in a league all of its own.,5,2018,05,28
217,Impressed,"Booked on points for 5 nights and could not have been happier.  On arrival we were immediately impressed with the views and grounds. The beautiful lobby contained baskets of fruit, fresh flowers everywhere, warm cranberry/apple punch, candies, and two beckoning lit fireplaces.  Our check-in experience  went exceptionally well with Rosheen (sorry sp?).  We were happy to find our room provided a beautiful view of Sugarloaf mountain and water fountain, nesspresso coffee,tea and cookies, replenished bottles of both sparkling and flat water, newspaper, nice toiletries, robe, slippers, large walk in closet, luxurious bedding and linens, comfy chair and ottoman, desk, beautiful marbled bathroom with separate tub and shower.
    Besides the beautiful rooms, we were impressed with the relaxing pool/hot tub area, the service provided in lounges and restaurants, and the plentiful activities within walking distance or short drive. 
    Concierge Robbie, was amazing!  We enjoyed talking (and laughing) with him on several occasions while he plotted and planned our day's activities.  I had done a ton of research and really appreciated his suggestions and maps.  We especially enjoyed walking to Powerscourt gardens and golf course, Sally Gap and Glendalough hikes in the Wicklow National Park, Powerscourt waterfall area hikes, Killiney, Dalke, and Bray.",5,2018,05,27
217,Another Fantastic Stay! ,"Just returned from another wonderful night at Powerscourt. Yet again our experience was 5 star all the way. We arrived early at 11:55 as we had a spa experience booked for 12. As we notified the hotel they had our suite ready and waiting at this time which was a lovely touch as check in is not usually until 4pm. 

We left bags in our room and went straight to the ESPA we ate lunch at the Spa Cafe which was just perfect and was presented beautifully. We then changed and began our experience “ the luxury retreat” package priced at €200 per person which included the lunch. It was worth every penny the treatments were out of this world the most relaxed we’ve ever been. The therapists were so friendly and helpful and really tailored the experience for us. They even accommodated us with a couples treatment room which was amazing.  

Our room was suite 108 which was ideally located next to the spa on the 1st floor and looked out over the courtyards water feature. Spacious, clean and comfortable. Only small complaint was the shower head was slightly broken so water pressure was a bit bit off. 

We dined at McGills Bar, it was busy as the Champions League was on but the food was excellent and the service was prompt although the staff did seem run off their feet. 

We returned to our room which had been turned down without request, nice touch. 

We had the breakfast buffet served in Sika, plenty of choices and no complaints food was hot and very enjoyable.  

Will be booking my next stay over the next few days. Can’t wait to return. ",5,2018,05,27
217,A dream location and fantastic service ,Our stay at Powerscourt can simply be described as wonderful. We arrived a bit early and were shown to the luncheon area as we awaited the room to be cleaned.  The service was excellent and the front desk stopped by after a while to let us know our room was ready. The luggage was delivered promptly and The bellhop showed us how to work everything in the room.  Touchpad screens took some getting used to and my wife was fascinated by the TV built into the bathroom mirrors.  The Concierge recommended a drive through the countryside to Glendalough for our second day and  this proved to be the perfect drive for us.  All in all a magical stay!,5,2018,05,26
217,Fantastic end to the day,Stopped by out of curiousity after visiting the gardens for the day.two of the female managers Seana and Katie greeted and served us and they were a humorous pair. They were recommending every cocktail to us to try and everything we had was fantastic. We even managed to get a last minute bite to eat even though the kitchen was closing ( thanks Katie) they were both just fantastic and made our day!! Wish we lived somewhat closer so we could visit more often but I guess that's just another great reason for us to book a night in soon!,5,2018,05,24
217,Wicklow wondering,"Amazing setting! Only stayed the one night and wish it was more, so much to do with the garden next door. 

Hotel is stunning and the spa is one of the best we have been too. Had lunch in sugar loaf which was delicious and the views are to die for. 

The main restaurant was fully booked so dined in mcgills which was ok, but will book ahead next time! 

",5,2018,05,23
217,So disappointed,"Stayed here for a special wedding anniversary for two nights. Lovely positive impression on driving to hotel. We were early for check in (by under an hour) and were told by the receptionist he would contact us on our mobile when room was ready and took our luggage. We had no problem with this as we were early. To pass the time we decided to treat ourselves to afternoon tea which was lovely. After no contact we returned to reception 2 hours later to be told our room was ready and were given no apology for no contact. At check in we were given no info about food/services in the hotel nor were we asked had we stayed before. Went to our room and no luggage delivered even though we had been hanging around the lounge for two hours.

The most disappointing factor was the clear lack of experience of staff and no obvious direction from senior staff for them. Orders had to be given multiple times for food to arrive, no salt/pepper on table for dinner, no milk on table at breakfast. 

To describe Sika as fine dining is a massive exaggeration. It was a chaotic experience and food was only ok. Furniture on the patio area was all muddled and thrown around , tables with no chairs etc. even though the weather was beautiful. 

Service and food in the bar was excellent and we were sorry not to have eaten there the second night.

When taking a shower on the second morning realised the shower gel had not been replenished. Not acceptable in a 5 star hotel.

Politely explained our experience on checkout and were simply brushed off. Not worth €900 for 2 nights and won’t be returning. Staff at checkout seem well used to negative feedback from the reaction we got. The person after us was also not happy with their experience.",1,2018,05,22
217,Stunning views & gorgeous rooms with excellent spa.,"My parents' treated us to a family getaway at Powerscourt after I was ill last year, and it was heavenly. The rooms were beautiful & super comfortable, the views were stunning and the spa was exquisite. Plus it helped to know that our dog was at the Sugarloaf kennels just over the mountain from us（╹◡╹）♡。I'd highly recommend Powerscourt to anyone looking for a relaxing, luxurious break ( ◠‿◠ )。",5,2018,05,22
217,Fantastic stay ,We had a fantastic stay the room was amazing a view of the grounds and the sugar loaf mountain. The beds so comfortable the staff excellent the food was also excellent I look forward to my next stay there. ,5,2018,05,22
217,Charming lunch on gorgeous grounds,We were here for a business lunch and everything about it said relax and take your time. The service was perfectly timed and professional. The sandwiches and salads beautiful and tasty. The view out the windows was fantastic. Worth the effort. ,5,2018,05,21
217,Lovely Hotel with Modern Touches,"The Powerscourt Hotel located on beautiful grounds is a modern version of a grand hotel. The spacious, traditionally appointed rooms come with touchscreen controls and fast wi-fi. 

The grounds are a highlight, with walking trails that can take you to immaculate gardens, a waterfall and the river. Quaint nearby towns offer a taste of Ireland. The restaurants serve well-prepared food, but service is uniformly and unusually slow.",5,2018,05,21
217,Disappointing hotel in beautiful area,"While the hotel is located in a beautiful area and the grounds are well maintained, this was the only positive aspect of our two night stay. We experienced issue after issue, including: air conditioning not working, curtains that wouldn’t open or close, rude staff, and staff entering when the do not disturb sign was present. Staff were difficult to reach during our stay, and did not resolve our issues in a timely fashion or at all. Most staff were rushed and inconsiderate, with the exception of Michael and Samuel who were kind in light of our disappointing stay. Our impression was that the hotel was poorly maintained (peeling wallpaper, cracks, dust, and non-functional curtains) and poorly staffed (hours spent waiting on staff assistance, rude/rushed when finally responding). I would not bring my family to this hotel again.",1,2018,05,21
217,"Very nice grounds, room and spa!","Stayed here with a friend for the night on a girls trip and we both had the most fabulous time. Staff are friendly and attentive. 

The spa facilities are kept very clean and the views are amazing. Nothing to fault here. 

After the spa we decided to order room service so didn’t use the main restaurant. 

An hour later we still had no food, turns out it was left outside the room because they knocked and we never answered. (Although we heard no knock)

We had to reorder as the food was cold. 45 minutes later we heard a knock, I made my way round to the door, to find the trolley of food left outside,with the staff gone, meaning I had to wheel through our lounge area to the bedroom myself. 

This was a bit disappointing as again I had to call up to say items had been left off the trolley and half the food was cold. 

Would certainly come back as everything else was perfect here, but the food and service for room service is disappointing so would not order from that menu again.",4,2018,05,21
217,Disastrous stay! Terrible staff!,"We have just returned from a weekend away at Powerscourt Autograph hotel. The staff were just awful from start to finish. 
I told Sarah in reservations when in booked that I was booking for a special occasion (husbands birthday) we were returning customers (stayed many times before including for a week in 2013 then Christmas package 2016) and she said there would be something special laid on! All we got was an awful room overlooking the car park!! Arrogant staff everywhere!
Dinner was a joke and staff should stay in fast food outlets they are clearly more used to!! The guy who served our bread was indecipherable speech-wise and really should not be serving in a 5 star resort!! Seriously...Our waiter failed to take a drinks order first and came and said “are yis ready to order now”? seriously... when we asked him if we could put in a pre dinner drinks order he told us they only sometimes do it like that but that usually they take the whole order together!! 🙄 No telling him how normal service goes, outside fast food outlets!!
Sugarloaf staff were hopeless throughout entire stay! It honestly felt like we were staying in zombie-land the whole weekend.
Staff at ESPA never once looked up to greet me or my family on entering or leaving the spa/pool. How rude... this was noted!! Just quite unbelievable! 
I’m not sure staff receive training in customer interactions at all! I dot believe staff have had any customer service training whatsoever!
Big written complaint will be going in shortly with specifics but overall our stay was completely ruined by the attitude and incompetence of ALL of the staff at this resort. Too much to go into in this summary but just awful. Very unhappy customers and will not be returning!!
Food was ok room was a bit dated and at €390 per night I would expect more!! 
A very unhappy customer...",2,2018,05,20
217,Wonderful place,"A wonderful place.  Do not let the exterior fool you, the interior is fantastic. David met us at the door and Sofia checked us in and helped very much. We had a huge spacious bedroom with a veranda on the 3rd floor.  One of the fanciest bathrooms we have ever had with a room.  From McGills Pub to the lounging area to the pool, this place is fantastic.  Will definitely stay here if we ever make it back.",5,2018,05,19
217,"Gorgeous rooms, but","The rooms and the hotel are beautiful and the staff could not have been more friendly or helpful.  We stayed in a large suite which was luxuriously decorated and comfortable.  The beds could be upgraded and the ""smart"" box control system needs to work correctly. The hotel restaurant Sika was the most disappointing part of our stay.  Mediocre food, and while friendly, the staff is not well trained.  The wine list is ordinary and overpriced.",4,2018,05,18
217,"Fantastic, luxurious night away","My sister, mum and I visited here for one night last weekend for my 30th birthday. 

I has a brilliant time, the hotel is very good value for money and the triple room was GORGEOUS and you genuinely couldn't ask for more on a lot of fronts.

The hotel is beautifully designed and the views out the back towards the mountains and especially the Sugarloaf are so relaxing and are a lovely backdrop.

The staff are so kind here and were good enough to leave some chocolates in the room as a 30th gift which was most appreciated.

I had a wonderful pedicure and facial with Yvonne who was so lovely. The spa is lovely if you can, go for some sort of treatment, as the treatment area and Serenity room are FAR superior that the general day spa.

Breakfast was so gorgeous - top quality - but the pancake maker takes forever, there has to be a quicker way of making pancakes!!

A few small things would make such a difference though to our overall stay.

The restaurant - very underwhelming. We were expecting a LOT more. We were seated sort of at the back in a really oddly laid-out part of the restaurant. It was really cold and the atmosphere wasn't great overall. Had the duck main which we all agreed was very tasteless and not what you'd expect for a 5 star restaurant! Pork belly starter was divine though. Staff were lovely, but I think you definitely need to improve some of the food and ambiance there. We couldn't wait to get out of there and up to our nice warm room!

Room - would have been great as there were 3 of us to get 3 bottles of water, just a small thing but makes all the difference.

Overall, can't wait to go back but definitely hope the restaurant has stepped up its game!",5,2018,05,17
217,Luxurious night away,"I bought the package that included the evening meal, massages and B&B for my boyfriends birthday. Everything was great!The hotel is one of the most beautiful places I’ve ever stayed. When you’re here, you get treated like royalty😊 the evening meal was delicious, the massage and the use of the pool and relaxation rooms is fabulous. I’ve never seen a spa like it, apart from the fact that it’s huge, it is so elegant in every way. Thoroughly enjoyed my stay and hope to do it again!",5,2018,05,13
217,Magnificent property for a vaction,"Had the opportunity to stay at Powers court hotel for a few days as part of a corporate event. The property is humongous, the staff is extremely helpful and the facilities are top notch.

The room was huge and had all the needed amenities that you would expect at a high star hotel. The bar and lounge was good and staff was helpful. The property can be explored by foot or by using the hotel cycle.

All in all, I enjoyed the stay and would not mind to return for a family vacation.",5,2018,05,13
217,Nice luxurious stay .,"Stayed there with family.nice suite with view but has requested a room with balcony on booking but was not given.so we were disappointed because were looking forward to sit out in balcony and enjoy the view.
Had in room dining,meals not very nice compared to even 3 star hotels in ireland.
Loved the view through the window,cleanliness of room,big living room and dressing room.bathroom was spotless and spacious.children enjoyed the small park ,running around in the grass etc.
Bed was very comfortable but pillows seemed to be old in appearance ..out of shape.There were 3 TV's in the suite .
The control of temperature,lights etc through touch panel seemed good but sometimes bit slow(Technology some times does that.No blame).
Flower arrangement in arrival hall was fantastic.
One staff at reception need some more training ,it seemed,regarding how to treat the guests.Sofy was so lovely and efficient but another lady Niamh was not pleasant . Felt that she was bit arrogant.
Had no direct interaction with any other staff in the hotel but met few on the way in and out of the hotel ,everyone had a warm smile on them which make a huge difference because the hotel is only a physical building but it is the staff that give it a heart and warmth leaving nice memories.",4,2018,05,11
217,Girls night away,"Four friends away upgraded to 2 suites we got fab suite 546 huge spectacular views of sugarloaf! Gowns, stocked mini bar fridge coffee machine. We had treatments included in our package we all booked aromatherapy massages...bliss! Staff in spa so gentle helpful unassuming never felt out of place lovely atmosphere! Beautiful infinity jacuzzi in women's room overlooking mountains, had swim in gorgeous pool! Then bk to suit shower change drinks to 4 course meal included in package. I loved the food. The pillows slept like a angel 😇. Some of girls went to gym but joined us for amazing 3 hr breakfast on veranda. Staff so kind even provided us with boxes and bags to bring muffins pastries home for our kids. The eggs benedict from menu with change of crispy bacon soo good and loved their cheeseboard and fruit. Endless coffee mint tea cappuccino etc staff so nice and attentive. Definitely coming back 💕

217,Beautiful and Grand!,"We thought we wanted to get out to the county after spending a week in Dublin so we chose this hotel which was only a short 40 minute drive from
our hotel In the heart of Dublin. It was like entering into an entirely different environment yet so close to the city. The hotel looks grand from the outside but the inside
Is stunning with the feel of old world luxury. The Tea Room sits against large windows which look onto the vast property and its lovely lawn. The rooms we requested were standard but upon check in we were given a very pleasant surprise of an upgraded suite! WOW! It had everything you could have asked for including a large separate bedroom and sitting area with a spa type bathroom and a TV built into the mirror. I cant say enough about the beauty and luxury of that suite.
Tea was vey nice and beautifully served. We ate at the Pub downstairs which was always lively and full of people. Morning breakfast was also delicious!
We did get to visit the Gardens but being winter there was not much in bloom. The cafe at the gardens were nice and was served cafeteria style but good food. We did enjoy all of the shops at the gardens and went back several times during our stay. I really hope to go back to this hotel again during months of better weather and really take in the entire property including the golf course.

217,lunch on the terrace,had a lovely lunch yesterday in the sunshine  but service was very slow. when we ordered sandwich and wraps and then fries the waiter didn't mention the sandwiches etc came with fries so ended up with 8 portions !! also ordered water 3 times before it arrived,4,2018,05,08
217,Lounge staff- Michelle,"Good to see staff staying @ the hotel. Can’t find any better than Michelle.
She is excellent at what she does & very welcoming. Visit the hotel every few weeks & it is nice to see familiar staff. Service excellent",5,2018,05,07
217,Beautiful Hotel,We were only there for one night so didn't get to enjoy all the amenities but the room was large and comfortable and the view was lovely. The bathroom was amazing! The nicest one out of all the places we stayed on our trip. We were checked in and out quickly and all of the staff we encountered were very friendly and helpful. If I have a chance to return to Ireland will definitely plan on staying there again (and for longer),5,2018,05,07
217,Good but let down by small details,"Just back from a weekend stay in powerscourt. It was my 40th birthday so wanted a perfect weekend break with my wife. We booked afternoon tea in the sugarloaf lounge for Friday, meals in the restaurant and spa treatments Saturday morning. Lovely surprise to be told on check in that our room had been upgraded. It was fabulous. Really lovely bed, writing desk, sofa and arm chairs, opulent bathroom. We popped down to the lounge for tea at 4pm. Lovely window seat with spectacular views. The food for the afternoon tea is great. I ordered coffee and my wife tea. Coffee arrived for both of us. Waiter brought a pot of tea but for afternoon tea the tea itself was really dissapointing. The quality of the food, scones and deserts was first class though. We felt the service was a little slow in general and mistakes in orders happened a few times. At breakfast we got two decaf coffees instead of one ordered. My wife was also served cold poached eggs. They were quickly replaced but it's the kind of slip you wouldn't expect. The dining experience in the silka restaurant was superb. Food lovely. Lovely table outside again with beautiful views of the sugar loaf. I'd also mentioned in an email to staff that it was my birthday and if they could include a small muffin or cake with a candle or something would have been a nice touch. It didn't happen. The spa experience is amazing. Great treatments and nice lunch to. Overall I'd say a beautiful hotel let down by some minor lapses in service. The views and location are very hard to beat. A little surprised there was no concessions or discount on the beautiful powerscourt gardens on the estate. Seems like a missed promotional opportunity.
Thanks 
Michael",4,2018,05,06
217,Not 5 star - cut corners in evidence,"Overall we enjoyed our stay but it did not feel like 5 star luxury because the hotel appeared to be chronically understaffed, particularly in the dining areas.

The positives included a very spacious and plush de luxe room where housekeeping standards were excellent. The quality and choice of food at breakfast was world class. We enjoyed the pool and the gym and it was a nice touch to be told at reception when checking out that we were welcome to stay and use the pool and spa facilities that afternoon.

We dined in the Sugarloaf Lounge as the restaurant was booked up when I rang earlier in the week. The food in the Sugarloaf was good but more overlap with the food in McGill's pub would make sense as the choice there was somewhat broader. For example, McGill's has proper desserts like sticky toffee pudding, whereas the Sugarloaf Lounge serves tiny afternoon tea pastries as evening dessert, which seems odd.

The service in the Sugarloaf Lounge was very slow. A couple at a (very close) adjacent table waited over an hour for their main, and they weren't having starters. Service is notably bad when you start joking with strangers about it.

After dinner we sat in front of one of the fires in the lobby. There were about four other couples sitting at tables in this area but there was nobody taking drinks orders. I went back into the Sugarloaf Lounge and asked the already overworked waitress who was serving food if we could have drinks. In a five star hotel you shouldn't have to go in search of someone to take a drinks order.

The hotel advises guests on screens in the lift areas that certain times are very busy at breakfast. That is not a very 5 star thing to do. A hotel in this price bracket should be ready for guests whenever they present themselves. Breakfast was chaotic - with queues and 10 minute wait times to be seated, and dirty crockery piled up on side tables. There simply were not enough staff to clear tables promptly and remove crockery from the dining room. I have stayed in three and four stars where weekend breakfast is more professionally done than this. 

The hotel does not give guests the option of breakfast in bed unless you pay extra for the privilege - again, I have never seen this in a five star hotel and it is presumably adding to the dining room congestion.

The bedroom corridor was on the chilly side, suggesting yet more penny-pinching.

The facilities and food are up to standard but the overall offering is let down by insufficient staff. We did not encounter anyone who seemed to be coordinating service.",4,2018,05,02
217,Inexperienced staff - always check your bill,"Visited recently with a few friends. While there were delays in service caused by inexperienced staff, we still enjoyed a relaxing and luxurious stay. Upon checking out however, we discovered that our bill was almost 300 more than we thought - lots of incorrect charges, a bill for another room and parts of the package being added as extra charges. 30 mins at the desk with no offer of tea or coffee later, we checked out. Very poor that a 5 star hotel is let down by 2 star systems. Please always check your bill before you check out.",3,2018,04,30
217,Amazing find 45 mins south of Dublin,"Powerscourt hotel might be the best Marriott I’ve ever stayed at in my lifetime. I’ve logged 400+ nights with this chain and will be back to this hotel.  Everything is top notch.  The rooms are enormous and spacious. Ours had a a changing room with 4 closets, a bathroom with a rain shower, living room and separate bedroom (the bed was very comfortable).The 36 hole golf course is right across the street and costs range between $33-$65 euros depending on the time.  Lovely hotel and will be the highlight of your Ireland hotels.",5,2018,04,29
217,Powerscourt,"We had a lovely stay at this hotel. Check in was swift and the receptionist was super friendly and helpful. Our room wasn't ready so we left our luggage and went for lunch and she rang when it was ready. 
The room was huge and very comfortable. The tv screens built into the bathroom mirrors were a great touch. The bed was so comfortable.
We had dinner in the hotel in the siku restaurant. The view from the restaurant was beautiful. 
Breakfast had good selections and was plentiful.
We didn't have the opportunity to try the spa but it's on the agenda for the next visit.
A lovely break!",5,2018,04,28
217,Anniversary break,"Spent just one night at this beautiful hotel. We had a standard room with separate sitting room, dressing room and big bathroom with a tv. The room was spotlessly clean as you would expect with a five star hotel. Drinks in the bar were quite expensive but that is to be expected. We ate in McGills bar which was lovely and reasonably priced. Breakfast was beautiful great selection and very fresh and the restaurant was very relaxing.
I would definitely return.",5,2018,04,27
217,Amazing staff and great hotel,"I cannot say enough about this hotel. All of the staff is amazing, Robbie, Samuel, Patrick, Sofia, Janette, Jason, and Nino to name a few. I've been essentially living there for 21days, and they have welcomed me with open arms. 

They are extremely accommodating and make sure every guest is happy and enjoying their stay. The grounds are beautiful, and ESPA is great. I only wish the jacuzzi had actual jacuzzi temp (30 degrees + Celsius), it sits around 25 :(.

Thank you Powerscourt!!",5,2018,04,25
217,"Exceptional service, beautiful rooms!","I was a speaker at a conference here last week.  Every aspect of the service from check in to departure was exceptional.  Little things that made a big difference - a little cake on arrival as a 'welcome to the hotel', complimentary water in the room (not always standard in a high end property), and the service was just genuine and friendly.",5,2018,04,23
217,5 star 🌟for sure but nice to see they are human too 😝,"Stayed here this last weekend and we were blessed with this magical thing called the sun 🌞. The hotel is beautiful, the grounds are fabulous, and it is certainly staffed to five star standard couldn’t move five feet without a staff member greeting you with a smile which was great to see.

Our room was fabulous, we had a courtyard suite and it was worth the money. Bear in mind we got a wonderful deal with a hospitality discount 😘. The bed was huge, walk in wardrobe bathroom was really big and the sitting room was really comfy.  FULL MINI BAR so beware lol with accompanying 5 star prices, and yes I broke into it lol 😂.

We sampled all areas, had a drink in the lobby with a selection of pastries which were really delicious. Went to McGill’s for gin and tonic and found a little area outside to enjoy the sun. 

We went to the pool and spa and it was really fab, they use espa which is great and as a girl with long hair the fact they have conditioner in the showers is amazing ❤️. The pool was really cool, it was so dark Nd relaxing, steam room was broke which was a shame but the sauna and whirlpool were both good.

We are in McGill’s bar as we only wanted something bistro type, it was nice but it was not out of this world, the burger was ok slightly burnt and the chicken curry was good but the sauce was only ok.

The gardens are great, the property was really second to none albeit slightly hard to get around if you get a wrong elevator good luck finding anywhere lol. They are human with some lightbulbs gone along the way... working in a hotel it’s always some way nice to see everywhere is still essentially the same and some things just are never perfect.

I would say to keep the floor Boards looked at in 209 as there is 2 sticking up and are dangerous I am surprised I didn’t fall over and cut myself cos I am that awkward lol I mentioned it on checkout so I hope they fix it for the next guest.

It was a grey experience and we would def return!!! ",4,2018,04,22
217,Loved Every Minute! ,"Loved every minute of our stay. I would recommend Powerscourt to everyone! The stay was amazing and the staff were great and so helpful. The treatments were lovely and we really enjoyed the spa area - so clean and relaxing. Compliments to the chefs as well, have to say it is the best meal I have had in a hotel in a very long time. They also have a great variety for coeliacs. The rooms are a very good size and the beds are really comfortable. I will definitely be returning and can’t wait to book my next trip already!

217,"Smart, classy, comfortable, upmarket Hotel","Probably the best hotel staff I have ever had.  Each and every member of staff that I had reason to deal with was pleasant, helpful and did their absolute best to please - they succeeded on every occasion, from waiters to concierge to reception staff - quality, trained, pleasant and well mannered.  It goes without saying that the rooms are gigantic, facilities excellent, spa and restaurant all top quality.  This is a must stay hotel.  It was simply a pleasure to stay there",5,2018,04,21
217,Gorgeous Hotel in the heart of Wicklow mountain area,"Beautiful Hotel adjacent to the magnificent Powerscourt Mansion and Gardens, a must visit location in Ireland.  Hotel rooms were large, modern, and luxurious.  Staff was extremely considerate and helpful throughout our stay.  Food was good to excellent at the McGill's Pub.  Unfortunately, due to groups reserving the pub 2 out of our 3 days here we were not able to enjoy the Pub more often.  Gorgeous views all around this hotel.",5,2018,04,19
217,2 Recent Trips - Both with issues (long review),"I originally reviewed this hotel 5 years ago while it was part of the Ritz-Carlton group and gave it 5 stars and reviewed it as an absolutely amazing hotel. It is now an independently owned hotel, so how was our stay this time.

The location of this hotel is amazing and the hotel itself is stunning. It has the wow factor that some hotels will never have, and the wow factor starts before you even see the hotel.

February Stay

We arrived at around 3:45pm to be told by check-in that our room wasn't ready and that guaranteed check-in was after 4pm. House keeping was behind schedule and were told we would have to wait. After 45 minutes waiting I went back to reception to push for a room and after finding our reservation at the bottom of a pile, we finally got assigned a room.

When we went into the room, we weren't let down. The room was lovely, clean, amazing view and had the promise of the stay we wanted. Unfortunately this didn't last long. The TV in the bathroom was on full volume and the remote didn't work. House keeping/maintenance was called to report the issue. I called house keeping/maintenance again 30 minutes later and was told someone would be straight up. After another 20 minutes I went to reception to complain. Finally someone turned up, removed a panel and within a minute had synced the remote to the TV. How did housekeeping not notice or care that the TV was on full volume.

This wasn't the only issue. On first flush of the toilet, we discovered it was blocked and started filling up. I had to use the toilet brush to push whatever was causing it. Again my question is, how did housekeeping not noticed that the toilet didn't flush. If they had cleaned it, they would have flushed it.

Everything seemed to be great after that, until around 11:30 when we were trying to rest. I can only describe the noise I was woken to as that of tables and chairs being dragged around the restaurant directly below, and went on for quite sometime. Then again at around 6:00am, the same noise woke us up. We never heard one other noise or any voices in the room as they seem very well sound insulated, so whoever was causing this would have known how loud it was.

Sika Restaurant

I have to say, the Sika was one of the best meals and experiences. We have been to many fine restaurants, and experienced the restaurant many years earlier when it was Ramsay's. We felt it far exceeded that of the previous Ramsay's restaurant. The food wasn’t only tasty, but the portions were a good size and you actually left feeling satisfied and full.

Breakfast

For a luxury 5* hotel, breakfast is a massive let down. We have experienced far better run and stocked breakfasts in many other hotels. They tick the boxes of what is required, but don’t show anything that lifts the standard breakfast they offer, to that of a superior breakfast you expect here.
How can a restaurant that offers such and amazing evening meal, only offer such an average breakfast. As a comparison, we stayed in the once glorious Cameron House in Scotland, which took breakfast to a new level, which is something you expect here.

Complaint

We made a complaint about the issues was had and were offered a free room upgrade on our next visit.
I also decided to hold of reviewing our stay until after our next stay.

April Stay

We decided to stay again in April for a night and took the opportunity of the free room upgrade, which I arranged via email.

When we went to check-in I almost didn’t notice that they were charging me the full amount, until I showed the email. This was quickly resolved.
The room itself was a classic suit which was very similar to the previous deluxe room, but with an addition of a living area. You would have thought after complaining that you were upgraded to a room they had checked to have no issues.

I have attached some photos, which annoy me about the room.

I don’t understand how someone could make a bed using sheets that are too small for the bed, exposing the mattress protector underneath. Not nice and not pleasant to sleep on. I wouldn’t expect this in a budget hotel. (see picture)

My wife went to have a shower and as she touched the knob, it fell off onto her foot. The knob was clearly balanced on and had no ability to turn the shower on, the fitting was broken. The knob was cracked from what I can only assume is it falling off on many occasions while being cleaned. Housekeeping would have no excuse in not knowing this issue. (see picture)

The overall condition of the 'upgraded' room we received wasn’t upto standard. I can only guess that a previous guest (not recent, the stains were old) had dropped a cup of coffee, hitting a wall and carpets, which have never been cleaned. Also a large chunk had previously been taken out of the wall (see pictures). Both these only required a small repair and paint, that I’m sure maintenance could quickly do. Nobody wants to stay in a luxury 5* hotel with coffee stains splashed up the wall.

As with our last trip, almost everything is due to issues in housekeeping. This hotel needs to seriously address this area and find why housekeeping isnt performing.

This time we decided not to have breakfast after the disappointment of the previous breakfast.

Overall
The location of this hotel is amazing and the hotel itself is stunning but is unfortunately let down in a few simple areas that seem to all point to one area, housekeeping.

Neither of the 2 trips would deserve me to rate this hotel below an average 3 stars, but I couldn’t rate it above 3 either. It really doesn’t meet its potential and offers an average stay with a high price tag. The location really saves this hotel, but if you placed it within Dublin itself, then I would drop this easily to a 2 star rating.

2 stays within a short time, both with issues that you don’t expect for the price or standard of the hotel. Its going to be a while before we return again.",3,2018,04,18
217,Loved it!,"This hotel is absolutely gorgeous.  We went to celebrate our birthdays and we enjoyed every aspect of the trip! I would love to be staying longer  (we just had a overnight trip)
The hotel is spotless and the decor is amazing. 
The room was the most beautiful room we've ever stayed in! It had two bathrooms, living room, dressing room and a gorgeous bedroom and huge balcony!
The hotel staff were so nice and helpful and they treated us so well and really celebrated our birthday with us! I really loved this hotel and wish we had of had more time there!

The food is amazing, everything on the plates complimented each other and it was so delicious. The breakfast was buffet with loads of choice! 

Go, relax and enjoy! Thank you to the staff! ",5,2018,04,17
217,Fantastic place ,"It is an absolute charming place very cozy from the lobby to your room ...
Furnitures are at a top level
Quiet place for a seminar or any kind of travel 
Breakfast is really good,  lots of choices ...
One remark ... some bad odors in the bathroom ! 
Despite this, it is an awesome and majestic place",5,2018,04,10
217,Beautiful hotel but terrible breakfast service,"We were planning to visit the Powerscourt Castle and had arrived early and decided to have breakfast at the hotel.  We were seated quickly but after that the service was terrible.  We ordered toast and coffee upon seating and both were not delivered until we were basically done with eating breakfast.  We had asked several times and several staff for coffee and it still took a while to receive.  Similar to other reviews we were not shown where the breakfast was, we had to walk around and find for ourselves.  When it came time for the bill, we asked for the bill and again had to wait, the person we asked actually was socializing with the guests next to us and completely forgot we asked for the bill.  At this point we probably could have walked out without paying - that is how inattentive the staff was - it was as if we were invisible.  At the end we had to walk up to the podium and tell them we wanted to pay our bill at which time we paid,  As a result of this experience we would not stay at this hotel.",2,2018,04,10
217,pure luxury,"a beautiful location with amazing views. the hotel itself is beautifully decorated, large spacious rooms with fantastic facilities. only issues we had were the hours that room service was available for, and the selection available on the menu. Sika was amazing and the bar was nice too. ample parking and lovely staff.",4,2018,04,09
217,"Powerscourt!  Superb Hotel, one of the best in Ireland","The hotel was fantastic, clean, spacious and plenty of staff to help you every need.  The parking, was perfect.  The grounds are amazing.  As for the staff, could not go out of their way more to help you!! Definitely recommend.  I will be back!",5,2018,04,09
217,Exquisite hotel - loved it - great on the front or back end of an Ireland holiday,"We selected Powerscourt for our last night of a 2 week Ireland holiday. We were greeted by Dave, who remembered us all afternoon everywhere we went. He took our luggage and our car, which was a welcome change from driving on narrow roads. The room was superb and we enjoyed lunch in their pub. We walked the gardens and the hotel offered to drive to Enniskerry for one last Irish town visit. Thank you for making our last day memorable!",5,2018,04,08
217,Amazing hotel and beautiful surroundings ,"This was our 3rd visit to Powerscourt and as has always lived up to expectations. Stayed one night bed and breakfast and couldn’t recommend it highly enough. Staff were friendly and helpful, stunning hotel and surroundings! We did the Powerscourt gardens- lovely walk and beautiful scenery!",5,2018,04,06
217,Quiet Irish Getaway,"I've stayed here with my wife a few times and we love this hotel. Its just outside Dublin so quick to get to for a night or 2 away but feels like you are miles away from a city. Every time we have stayed here we have had a great time. The staff are second to none, the rooms are luxurious and beautiful, the food in Sika is excellent. We often use the spa, which is one of my favourites from anywhere in Ireland. We are both well travelled and Powerscourt is still one of my favourite hotels I've stayed in. Can't wait to go back again",5,2018,04,05
217,Easter Break,"We had a great time at Powerscourt. The staff were friendly and kind. The location was very convenient and accessible to other amenities. The room was very nice and very comfortable to stay at, and we found ourselves very relaxed in the rooms. The food we had was very delicious. The pool was also very good and relaxing, and we hope to come again.",5,2018,04,04
217,Wish we had stayed elsewhere...,"After years of wanted to visit this hotel and finally shelling out to stay myself and my partner left disappointed.

There is no doubt that the hotel and grounds are stunning but that's pretty much where the positives end for me.

The lobby at check in was mayhem. Kids running around screaming, a long queue and suitcases just left in the middle of the room while their owners went to the desk..

I requested an early check in (there is an option to request this at booking). I emailed a week before to say I hadn't heard anything and would it be possible.. I emailed again as I got no response. I finally got an email to say it can't be guaranteed but to come along early anyway and if it's not possible we can use the facilities etc which was fine by us.

After some wait we approached a lady at the front desk. Didn't look at us didn't smile or ask how we were etc, I mentioned we had requested an early check on and tried to continue with 'but it's fine of its not ready' only to be rudely cut off by her telling us check in isn't until 3..
We filled out our details and again she said we will call you when ready but check in was not until 3. I told her i realised this and walked off feeling very put off and annoyed before our night away even started.

20 minutes later a different but very nice employee called us to say our room was ready. First impressions really are everything however ours was already tainted despite this nice employee.

Our bags were dropped down almost an hour later (which was OK as we had checked in early) and off we went to the Spa.
Changing rooms were fantastic. Lovely big showers, robes, lockers etc. Unfortunately the sauna was out of order so we used steam room which was nice. Ice bucket was tap temp not ice but small complaint. 
Poor area was nice but old towels and water cups everywhere.. wasn't pleasant to look at. Jacuzzi was nice.

I headed back to the room while my other half used the gym. Whilst gettig ready with the Do not disturb sign on an employee entered the room. He did ring the bell but I didn't answer as I was in the bathroom at this stage.. He needed to replace a bottle of wine for the mini fridge or we would have been charged apparently... a bit irritating..

About an hour later when we were both back at the room with the Do not disturb sign on again the bell went off followed by knocks on the door. It was the same man that dropped down the suitcase to ask if he had dropped in a bag incorrectly as one had gone missing! 
We were staying only 1 night and had already been disturbed twice before dinner! 

We ate at McGills..
We were served by about 5 different people and had to request water 4 times (off the same person!) No apologies.
The menu is not the same as what's on the website. My partner asked for the falafal burger from the menu on the website and was told it was no problem so this was good.. my food came and no sign of my partners. 10 minutes later my partner had to go flag someone at the bar to ask about his food. At least another 10 minutes passed before it finally came (mine was half eaten and cold at this stage) and my god what a tiny portion he received. More like a lunch than a dinner. We didn't eat together which is just unacceptable and my curry was very average.

The Only good thing about the 'dining experience' was the wine which was lovely.

We were hungry and annoyed so we retired to the bedroom with our last drink and still couldn't get the air con working.

I wasn't waiting around the next day to speak to a manager but I emailed my issues first and had I have received a decent response I would not have wrote this review.

The guest relations manager seemed apologetic and said she was passing my complaint onto operations manager. The assistant operations manager emailed me some days later to say my feedback was passed on to relevant departments.. I replied to say I was very surprised that I got a standard reply from a 5 star establishment when our experience was unacceptable and never got a response so here I am!

If you are debating about staying here I would suggest otherwise.. save your money and stay in the town or the Summerhill!",2,2018,04,02
217,Lovely Hotel but a bit lacking in areas,"Recently stayed here with family. Short stay of just one evening. Our family of four..2 adults, 2 teenagers had a room with 2 double beds. Beds were very comfortable. Room was large and the bathroom was amazing. Reception and lobby are lovely but small...cozy. Do not recommend the “movie package”...seemed like a good deal but the movie selection was outdated. Loved the dual fire places in the lobby area. 3 restaurants...main floor dining/bar with a stunning view, Sika..high end, great views again, and a pub...good pub grub. There is a small bar just outside of Sika that was never open at any point during our stay. Attempted to dine at Sika, without a reservation, without success. Plenty of open tables it seemed but no availability. Disappointing. We were accommodated at the dining area upstairs but that seemed to be an inconvenience for the staff. There is a spa and a gym (I think) but not much else in the way of amenities that I could find. However, Powerscourt House and Gardens is a short 8-10 minute walk with shopping and dining. Golf club is a short walk as well. Perhaps our stay was just too short to appreciate it all. Not sure I would return for a longer stay for the price however.",4,2018,04,02
217,Outstanding ,"Myself and my husband stayed here for 6 days during our trip around Ireland and I have not one bad thing to say. We had lunch in sugarloaf lounge twice. One day was afternoon tea which was fantastic, and the second day was from their lunch menu, super tasty! We dined in sika one evening where they serve an exceptional set menu with some gorgeous wine selections. We ate in McGills bar on one evening which was different, was not expecting this style pub in this hotel but we had a great night.. All the staff here are absolutely incredible. They go that extra mile to deliver 5 star service. We would like to say a huge thank you to you all, especially the receptionist (we regret not remembering her name but she had long brown hair and piercing blue eyes!!) who checked us in on arrival and chatted to us throughout our stay ensuring we were enjoying ourselves and if there was anything she could do to help. I already miss this hotel and I can not wait to return and hopefully bring along some friends. ",5,2018,04,01
217,Room for improvement,"First things said - it‘s not a Autograph Collection. It’s named as one, but who are they kidding? I actually love the autograph collection since it’s very individual. But this hotel is only a Ritz which didn‘t want to be called a Ritz anymore. They just changed the name everything else is just a Ritz...

We didn‘t get an upgrade, although I am a platinum member. Basically the lady at the check in counter didn’t even care that I am a platinum member - normally you at least get the sentence: Thank you for your loyalty. At least...

I had a spa treatment, I had to wait 15 min, the serenity room which you are suppose to relax before the treatment was full and my therapist clearly rushed through the massage.
The Spa area itself is nice, but you only get something to drink when you have booked a treatment. It seems without a treatment you are worth nothing. PLUS for some reason they did constructions on the PoolSide! Really loud constructions. The pool closes at 9 pm, plenty of time to use the evening for stud like that. 

The ICE Rooms were so disgusting, its so dirty. Don‘t go in there, just order some Ice. 

I requested a foam pillow 2 days ago, I am still waiting for it. 
Breakfast this morning - order by in room dining was 30 min late - not reduction on that.

You could clearly figure that the hotel is overbooked right now, which is ok, but the staff is not able to deal with that. So if you want to have a good time here don‘t come during busy times - you will regret it! You pay so much money for an average experience. ",4,2018,04,01
217,To many mistakes to give 5 stars,"I stayed in the hotel for 1 night with my partner. 
It was a beautiful hotel, check on was seamless very welcoming. 
Room was amazing very spacious, very clean. Bed we're very comfortable. Loved the tv as it could be linked to your phone or tablet for Netflix etc. 

We ate in Mc Gills bar, the people working there were so friendly. The menu gave us such a choice, I had the steak sandwich and my partner the lamb and both was so tasty. The cocktails were amazing !! Great atmosphere. 

We rang for the turn down service that was offered, we ordered it, but it didn't happen. 

The room was slightly cool, we rang down to reception to get advice on how to turn of the aircon. They said there is a panel near the door or at bedside separate to the thermostat to turn it off, there wasn't, so we just pressed enough buttons that it turned off at the thermostat but unfortunately came back on overnight again.

Went to the pool, being school holidays it was full of kids, however the hotel has designated times for kids, a brilliant idea. Went down to the pool in the morning after the kids time, and it appeared some sort of maintence was going on and some sort of banging or something from the man carrying out the work, not relaxing therefore, not sure why it couldn't have went on during closed times? 
The Changing facilities were next to none, very nice plenty of space and loved the showers. 

Breakfast was madness, although the hotel had signs up saying the busy times to highlight this to the guests, we did not receive a good service here, when we were sat to our seat, the man just walked away, we had to figure out where to even go for the food ourselves as it was not visible, then we had to call someone over to get tea and coffees and then again to order of the breakfast menu, toast was cold when it arrived. We had no big spoons on our table (all the other tables around had them obviously a mistake) my partner had to go around the restaurant looking for spoons as he couldn't get anyone's attention. The food was amazing however, loved the choices. 

We feel we would not give this hotel 5 stars as a whole the experience did not keep to the level a 5 star hotel, as a whole would adhere to. 

I read other reviews here, which are mainly positive and I am so upset that we had such a negative experience. We enjoy having regular hotel breaks as a couple, and every other break We have been on around Ireland be it 3, 4 or 5 stars has been amazing.   
We spent €330 on our room and breakfast. We feel it was not worth even half of that. 
",3,2018,04,01
217,My unforgettable experience ,"We stayed in this hotel to celebrate our 25th wedding anniversary. The 1 bedroom suite was very spacious, clean and the bed was  comfortable. Staff were very attentive. We had the best ESPA treatment ever ( Powerscourt signature ritual)! Special mention to Sabrina. Their ESPA treatment is second to none. Beautiful scenery overlooking the sugarloaf mountain. I can't wait to go back.",5,2018,03,31
217,Great Birthday Treat,"My Girlfriend Surprised me to a stay in the Powerscourt Hotel in Co. Wicklow. We arrived to a warm welcome at reception. Roisin and Chris were there, they explained all our dining options on the night, he suggested the Sika restaurant but as we had just came from lunch we decided to have a light meal in McGill’s bar where again we met Chris and another manager Michael. They had us convinced they were brothers in there words the chuckle brothers! They where amazing. They found out that it was my birthday and arranged a birthday dessert for me. Reception informed us on our arrival that we had been giving an upgrade on account of it being my birthday. What a treat! The room was fantastic, the TV in the bathroom was a great touch!! The next morning we had breakfast in the lobby where we were welcomed by Michael who we met the night before. He took great care of us and arranged a late check out as we wanted to use the spa facilities before we left. Sally in the lobby was so helpful she could not do enough for us.
The spa is one of the best I have been to. My girlfriend has not stoped talking about it and is recommending it to all her family and friends.
Thank you Powerscourt for making it a birthday to remember and to the “Chuckle brothers” again thank you!",5,2018,03,30
217,Afternoon tea,"Came here for afternoon tea on a Saturday. My wife and I shared the tea at €39 plus €4.95 for extra place setting. The tea had four small sandwiches which were fine. There were also 2 scones with cream and jam. These were delicious. There was also a pannacotta. However no spoon was supplied with this so we used a teaspoon. There was also a small raspberry tartlet.We asked for decaf tea and we were  supplied with a teapot full of hot water and one pyramidal teabag each. No extra container was supplied for the used teabag so we had to put them on our saucers. My wife likes strong tea while I like weak tea so we like to make our own and not put both teabags in the teapot. Service was excellent. Staff were very helpful, attentive, efficient and friendly. The views were spectacular. A very enjoyable experience we hope to go again.",5,2018,03,24
217,"Very, Very Good",Nice rooms and good food. Service lacks a bit but overall a very good stay. Nice walk around the grounds and lots of wildlife to see. Best place hotel in Wicklow for ambiance. Very good views and comfy beds.,5,2018,03,13
217,Can't fault,"Stayed in powerscourt in January it was a perfect getaway,
Beautiful hotel and gardens.
Breakfast was really good a great selection.
We had dinner in the pub and was delicious.
We visited the waterfall which is a must as it is so beautiful and not far from the hotel. 
We stayed in a suite and was fantastic. The staff are so friendly. The pool area is so nice and relaxing .",5,2018,03,09
217,Questionable staff training? ,"I decide to choose Powerscourt to have my birthday celebrations. 
The restaurant it’s self is both modern and contemporary. 
The staff leave much to be desired, they appeared to be like headless chickens. 
Not knowing how/where to serve food and general table etiquette along side fine dining service which is expected in a five star Hotel. 
Three of us had the steaks and all were very Tough and tasteless.
As for the atmosphere, NONE ! Restaurant was practically empty, even though the tables were so far away from each other, I don’t know why they didn’t corner off one part of the restaurant which would have made it seem busier. 
The manager that was on that evening was both discourteous and Rude as I had told his understudy about my issues he was very understanding yet his superior was confronting and invasive! 
",2,2018,03,08
217,Room with a view,Spent a lovely weekend at this fine hotel. Room was amazing and when we opened curtains in the morning looked like we were on base camp at Sugar Loaf. Food in the restaurant was excellent and it is worth travelling to the hotel for breakfast alone. Good buzz and craic in the bar on the Sunday night. Best of all were the staff who were very Courteous and helpful. Special mention to Stephen in reception and also the other guys who went out of their way to get me a bouquet of flowers in Bray at short notice.,5,2018,03,05
217,Gorgeous Hotel!,It was just after Xmas and all the stunning decorations were still up - it was stunning when we walked in.  We had a gorgeous room - which was far bigger than I imagined it would be.  Three large beds (one king and two doubles) a massive wardrobe area and lovely bathroom - complete with tv screen in the bathroom mirro which our 12 year old son loved!  The pool area and spa area is stunning.  We had a large dinner gathering and met in the bar upstairs for drinks.  It was the only thing that let the evening down - the service - hard to get service - and we had drinks forgotten and hard to get any attention.  The service at the restaurant was much better - the foods was lovely.  Buffett breakfast is fantastic.  The grounds are gorgeous and its a little piece of paradise in the country.,5,2018,03,05
217,Storm Emma,"Beautiful hotel and grounds, lovely rooms, food and drink but need to give particular kudos to the staff! Having arrived for a 4 night stay due to storm Emma it ended up being a 7 night stay, the staff were absolutely incredible ensuring we could stay in our rooms and looking after us every hour of the day, nothing was too much trouble and despite the staff having to stay at the hotel themselves and work very long shifts every day they were never anything but cheerful and were friendly and efficient. Being stuck for a week with a big party they even tried to put in special menus and entertainment for us. Staff were so special! A credit to the hotel, well done! Home from home.",5,2018,03,04
217,Girls January trip,Loved this hotel. Rooms were fabulous . Bedding comfortable . Great atmosphere and food in the bar. Breakfast was fabulous. Grounds are beautiful but didn’t get to enjoy due to poor weather. Will definitely return .,5,2018,03,03
217,Exceptional atmosphere & flawless staff,"My stay here occurred during the snow storm, which saw the nation at a stand still - with apparent exception to the powerscourt hotel. 
I cannot put into words the gratitude I have for the staff in this hotel. With special mention to Katie and Ross, ensuring the perfect balance of a professional and friendly service, delicious food and mouthwatering cocktails, they really went above and beyond during my stay. I was made feel nothing was too much to ask.
It's evident this hotel has succeeded in maintaining the highest standard  demonstrated in exceptional staff morale even in the most challenging of times.They are a true credit.
The grounds itself in the Powerscourt hotel are breathtaking - 10/10. With a home-like and warm atmosphere, this hotel is an all-rounder. 
The gym facilities are perfect and the pool and spa are exceptional.
My stay here cannot be flawed, and I'd like to thank everyone for making it this way for me.

217,Exceptional Service ,Had a very enjoyable night in the hotel bar. Even with the country at a standstill due to snow storms. We found the hotel staff were in great form and very accommodating to all of us. Especially Cian's great Guinness pouring skills!,5,2018,03,02
217,I’d Give It 10 Stars if I Could,"Service is king here.  The staff is amazing.  I stayed during a historic snow storm and was trapped for 7 days.  The staff did not miss a step. Professional, courteous, friendly. They went above and beyond including staying days on end on site to be sure their high level of service was uninterrupted.  This place is first class and earns it everyday.  Stephen was one example. Young bar tender I met during a business cocktail hour and 3 days later he remembered my name. Never had that happen in any of the hundred or so hotels I have stayed in.  

Great people.  

I’d come back and tell my friends to do so as well.  ",5,2018,03,02
217,Loved it!!,"I stayed at the Powerscourt hotel with my daughter at the end of February. It was part of her Christmas presents and tradition as we try a different place every year. Powerscourt is by far the favorite, it has stunning views, beautiful warm hotel and great staff...  The SPA is really nice, I had a facial and fell asleep it was so relaxing, Hannah the therapist was really good and had a nice manner. We had dinner at the Sika restaurant which was really good and a couple of drinks in the traditional pub to finish off the evening. There are good walks around the grounds... we were upgraded to a suite which was amazing!!  Would highly recommended, great for couples as well...",5,2018,03,02
217,Luxury hotel,"This hotel offers some of the biggest rooms I have had when staying in hotels. 
The staff is extremely helpful and committed to offer the guests a pleasant stay. 
The surroundings are beautiful. 
There is free WiFi and a nice gym and spa.  ",5,2018,03,02
217,Sheila mc,"Stayed in this hotel Feb 2018 absolutely stunning . Staff all really pleasant ,the rooms spotless . The gardens were beautiful even though it was February we really enjoyed the walk i would love to see them in  the summertime  must be just fantastic . The spa and pool were lovely as well .The shops on site were really nice we did make a few purchases there too. would love to go back there even though it was rather expensive. We just loved it.",5,2018,02,28
217,Mini bar accusation?,"Me and my partner stayed here for a mini break. We had been before and loved it, all in all it was a lovely stay gorgeous room great location but strange check in as i had to pay a deposit of 300 euro incase i charged to the room lucky i had the money in my account. Another gripe i had was the price of breakfast was shocking 28 euro for a fry, there is also a charge for certain areas of the spa which i think if you are a hotel resident it should be free, as sauna was broke there wasnt many areas to go. Then the main annoyance was i got an email asking me had i took items from the mini bar, firstly i wouldnt pay the extortionate prices for a bar of choc and secondly i had my own snacks i took, i did reply to deny this but never got a reply to apologise, was a good relaxtion stay but some strange greed like parts which i didnt like, ",4,2018,02,25
217,Not good anymore..,"Positives.. The hotel still looks like a 5 star hotel, the rooms are beautiful, the spa is gorgeous etc. The hotel is super clean and well maintained. When we discovered our hair dryer didn't work it was replaced within 10 minutes. 

Negatives..The food at lunch in the bar was very poor and the service was very slow. The food at dinner in the restaurant was hit and miss, some dishes like the crab risotto were delicious but other dishes e.g. the monkfish were not good. We were a large group and were given a table right at the back of the room for dinner and virtually abandoned. There were plenty of staff on duty but it was impossible to get their attention when you needed more water etc. 

It is such a pity as this is a beautiful hotel with so much more potential.",3,2018,02,25
217,Partners Birthday,"I booked a night away in Powerscourt hotel for myself and my fiancée as a birthday present for her. It was my first time staying in this hotel and I was blown away by the surrounding country side and the quality of the hotel itself. I had no idea somewhere so close to Dublin city was so picturesque!

When booking the hotel I had mentioned to the staff that It was my partners birthday and asked if they had any recommendations as what to do. The staff member I was dealing with (Robbie) was incredibly helpful and suggested a number of things including a treatment in the hotels spa as a possible option. 

I was put in touch with Emma who works in the hotels spa and she made all the necessary arrangements for my partner to have a treatment just after we arrived. This was the first time she was going to have any sort of spa treatment and was a bit apprehensive about it which I explained to her.

When she arrived down to the spa for her treatment Emma was waiting to show her around and put her mind at ease. She was incredibly nice and explained the different parts of the spa and also recommended a message she might like. 

Although I didn't have a treatment in the spa myself I heard nothing but glowing comments about it over dinner from my partner. ""Why didn't I do this sooner.... we should do this again... the masseuse Ghada was amazing"".

We ate McGills pub  that night which we enjoyed although if we were to dine there again we would make sure to get there a bit earlier. When got to the pub, which is inside on a lower floor in the hotel, at 8:30pm we had a bit of a wait in order to get a free table. 

When we arrived back to our room after dinner we found that Robbie had left a birthday card and chocolates for my fiancee which was above and beyond anything I was expecting. That was very impressive and unfortunately I didn't get to thank him in person for this before we left the next morning. 

It was a fabulous experience from start to finish and my partner was delighted with it too which was the main thing for me. We both cant wait to go back!",5,2018,02,22
217,Mother's birthday,Fabulous hotel in a stunning setting. Although the hotel was beautiful and very comfortable the best thing about it was the staff. Everyone we encountered went out of their way to ensure we had a wonderful time. Keith and Martin in the Sugarloaf lounge were so kind to us - especially my mum who was celebrating her 84th birthday that day.  We ate in McGills bar. It was casual dining which is exactly what we wanted. The fish and chips was delicious. Breakfast was one of the highlights of our stay. It was amazing - so much choice and everything was really fresh. The staff at breakfast were fantastic in particular Gabor and Simon. I can't wait to go back.,5,2018,02,21
217,Disappointing,"This was my second visit to Powerscourt, we visited 2 years ago at the same time of year and enjoyed our stay so much we could not wait to return. We were looking forward to the visit very much but were left very disappointed and our group of 6 agreed it will be our last visit and it left us with absolutely no desire to return. There are far superior 5 star hotels around the country. 
The service was abysmal - if this was a 3 star hotel I woudl have been disgusted, but that a hotel with this reputation offered such a poor level of service was a disgrace - the staff that greet you as you arrive are great, very courteous and professional but after that forget it. It ranged from disinterested to downright rude from this point on. 
The Restaurant is very casual, no table linens, plastic placemats, the menus were sheets of paper, the set menu was €55 - this did not include any side dish so you had meat only and if you wanted any potato/ veg etc this was extra - this had changed since our last visit. The service again was so poor it was laughable - we had to request a soup spoon AFTER the soup had been served and the same with steak knives for 2 diners. No one checked on us during the meal and after asking for decaf coffees and waiting 20 mins at the end of the meal we gave up and left the restaurant. Breakfast the second morning was served in an ""overflow"" function room with no windows and awful conference style chairs and tables. Again, the service here was so bad, orders not put into the kitchen, coffees not being brought etc -we asked for toast and were told to go make it ourselves. Just so poor that we did mention upon checkout how let down we felt. We had drinks in the Sugarloaf lounge the first night, we had to ask for the order to be brought twice and received a sulky attitude and drinks slapped on to the table in front of us. The rooms were beautiful and had been upgraded since our last visit - you had to pay €12.95 to watch TV, which was hilarious. It was really the very worst ""5 star"" experience any of us have ever had - I woudl advise anyone booking to go elsewhere - its too much money to pay for a disappointing trip when there are far better places to stay.",1,2018,02,19
217,Romantic Break,"Beautiful scenery, gorgeous spacious bedroom (more like an apartment!). Our stay was incredibly relaxing and comfortable with delicious food in the Sugar Loaf restaurant and the super breakfast the following morning. Biggest regret was we did not stay a second night! 

Some staff (waiting - at breakfast and in Sugar Loaf) were a little under trained in the basics. I understand they may have been new and still learning. Although perhaps it may be a good idea to inform all staff of where the bathrooms are so they can give directions, and also that they know the basics of the menu. Most other staff were very friendly and helpful and we didn't let this take away from our wonderful time here.",5,2018,02,18
217,February break,"So I turned 50 recently and my husband asked me to choose any hotel I wanted to celebrate the occasion. So I chose Powerscourt as we had never been there before and we wanted to explore this part of Wicklow. 
The entrance to the hotel is very impressive and the hotel itself is palatial. The foyer area is very open plan with lots of groups having afternoon tea and cupcakes. We arrived at 3.00 on 14th February and after a long journey from Tyrone my husband fancied a pint of guinnesss to start our holiday. However, McGill's bar did not open until 6 so we ordered some tea instead in the Sugar Loaf foyer area. The bedroom was beautiful with lavish traditional furnishings but some modern touches such as the TV in the bathroom mirror, control panels, birthday treats etc. Our meal in Siko was top notch with excellent service, food and wine. We went into McGill's again for a drink but this time it was full of people eating and we didn't want to have to stand. 
Breakfast the next morning was very good- a slight queue which didn't annoy us and the pure honeycomb was interesting. After breakfast we walked up to Powerscourt Gardens which were amazing and we liked the itemized names on all of the plants in the long herbaceous border. The shops and café were nice also. We also visited the waterfall, Bray and Wicklow town and we got some pub grub and drinks in Philip Healy's. When we returned to the hotel we ordered some tea/ coffee and biscuits but they didn't have any biscuits so we got peanuts instead. 
After breakfast and a walk around the grounds we left after a relaxing stay and visited Avoca before heading to Dublin to visit our daughter and back to Tyrone. 
As I am interested in history and culture,I feel that the hotel should make more use of the beautiful surroundings and aim to keep guests in the hotel. The bar area should be separated beteeen those who wish to eat and those who wish to have a drink and hear some trad. Tourists like this. They could also have a little brochure in the rooms explaining the history of the estate and the rich surrounding area. 
These are just some of our observations but 'Ní lia duine ná tuairim' as we say in Irish! Class spot and I wouldn't put anyone off a holiday there.",4,2018,02,17
217,Overpriced and poor quality ,"Came for coffee and cake and to see what the hotel was like! Service was slow! Not interested because we were not having lunch! Coffee was not nice, deserts were poor and price was outrageous! Would not be bothered coming back! ",2,2018,02,15
217,Magical Trip ,"Just returned from a once in a lifetime trip to Powerscourt, with my now Fiancé!! 
Everything about this hotel is perfect, from check-in to check-out. 
We dined in the Sika restaurant on both nights and the food was exquisite. The service, in particular from Ravio (excuse my spelling if this is wrong), was exceptional. 

During the trip, myself and my partner got engaged at the newly opened amphitheater on the grounds. He had organised the whole thing with Chris and Michael (aka the Chuckle Brothers ☺️), and they went above and beyond to organise the perfect proposal. We cannot thank them enough! They were amazing from organising the lanterns, champagne (thanks Cedric!), chocolates and most importantly the blankets!! 

We stayed in one of the hotel suites for the two nights and it was pure luxury. There was a double vanity, a walk in closet, sitting area and bedroom. As well as the most amazing view of the fountain, amphitheater and mountain range. 

We would like to thank all staff in the hotel for making this an amazing trip ❤️",5,2018,02,15
217,First Class,"We had a wonderful few days in Powerscourt . This is a beautiful hotel with wonderful facilities. Hotel rooms are so spaceous, very comfortable and spotlessly clean 
 We had an issue at check in but Samuel addressed it immediately and we were more than satisfied in how he resolved it.
Staff are fantastic- Friendly yet professional. 
Spa is indeed supreme and I had probably the best 90 minute treatment ever here from a massage goddess.
Food in SIKA was amazing and excellent value for money. Great service from all staff especially the DIT Engineering Student & the very interesting Kevin from Durban.
Lots to do in the area- Lovely River walk, the gardens etc.
I would higly recommend this beautiful place and we will be back. Thank You for a lovely break",5,2018,02,14
217,Perfect mid week getaway!,"We have just returned from a fabulous stay at Powerscourt Hotel, my husband, my 6 year old daughter and myself. The hotel is absoloutly beautiful and our stay was faultless. We had a seamless check-in and were shown to our room which overlooked the Sugarloaf mountain. We then went to the pool, kids pool times are a little restricted but we managed an hour anyway.

We had dinner at Sika restaurant which was really good. The food and the service was excellent, I had the Monkfish and the chocolate sphere which were amazing! We were served by Kevin who was very attentive. After dinner we had a drink in McGills bar which had a nice atmosphere. We were served by Chris who was very friendly and entertaining. We had breakfast in our room which, again, was really good! Following another quick trip to the pool we checked out, it was a fabulous stay and we will definately be back.",5,2018,02,14
217,Totally worth it!!!!,"My sister bought herself, me and our mam a night away for Christmas. Upon arriving we couldnt get over how beautiful it was!! Staff were so lovely and attentive, food and drink is lovely. Yes it is expensive but it should be on ""bucket lists"" as its totally worth every penny. Ive already rebooked for July for my other halfs birthday and fingers crossed we are going for our girlie weekend again in August. Loved every second and would recommend staying for a minimum of two nights as one night is not enough. ",5,2018,02,11
217,Nice,"Lovely hotel & surroundings, staff were very friendly. Food in Sika restaurant was just ok - breakfast again no wow factor and a lot of staff were very young, cold teas & coffee arrived to us and we noticed burnt toast on one ladies table - it’s a shame as it is such a beautiful hotel. Short haired lady at breakfast kind of blonde seemed over the younger staff was a bit vocal - as in you could hear her comment on certain things & she scolded a young member of staff beside our table which is just unprofessional - the girl was clearly upset by it. Another lady at breakfast long blonde hair in pony tail, lovely & very busy doing a lot running around trying to keep everything going.
Bedroom amazing! Reception staff all lovely 
I think this hotel has a few rough edges that need to be smoothed out, more attention to detail.
The spa was supreme! As were all staff within it.
Tatu was extremely polite & professional he takes pride in his job and is a credit to the hotel. ",4,2018,02,11
217,Afternoon tea @ Powerscourt,I have just finished afternoon tea with my wife at Powerscourt Hotel. We had a wonderful table by the window overlooking the beautiful scenery of the hotel gardens. We were greeted by Katie I believe at the desk and couldn't of been more friendly. All the food was delicious and took home some of the goods we couldn't finish. If you're lucky enough to have Martin as server you will have nothing but an enjoyable experience here! 5 stars,5,2018,02,09
217,"Amazing, great view, great hotel","Amazing, amazing, amazing... view was great! The food was incredible and service was of high standard, very elegant. Christian made sure that we had everything we needed, he was also very attentive and postive with a constant Smile on his face.",5,2018,02,08
217,Stunning Hotel !,"I do not have words to describe this beautiful location and hotel!! We had a lovely lunch where Christian made sure the service was up to standard, he recommended that we visit the stunning grounds of the hotel and stunning it was indeed. It was a 10/10 experience ",5,2018,02,08
217,Excelent!,"Great service, great food, wonderfull view, and the manager Cristian was great! I reccomand to visit this hotel for the best irish cofee, a great garden, nice staff, great ambiance, and great desserts! I will be back! ",5,2018,02,08
217,Great hotel ,"We enjoyed a lovely afternoon and were greeted very kindly by the staff members, the service was great and one of the managers Christian, was very welcoming and made sure all our needs were met. The location is superb! ",5,2018,02,08
217,Excellent Hotel,"Stayed in Powerscourt in January and it was truly amazing from start to finish. It is so rare now to find that healthy balance between five star luxury and a genuine welcoming feel, well this hotel has mastered it! When we checked in we were tired and unenthusiastic following a very difficult month for my family and I. It was a much needed luxury break.  We ate in the restaurant on the first night and our server was a complete gentleman and made us feel right at ease. Great selection on the menu and the goat’s cheese dish was the best I have ever tasted. I would also recommend the chocolate fondant which is a little bit of theatre on a plate! The restaurant has a stunning garden view and by breakfast the following day we were regaining some of our energy. I hadn’t booked the spa but an appointment for a facial became available on my second day and it was definitely worth it. The spa facilities and pool are beautiful and the products are divine, so much so I purchased a few of the facial range and they are amazing. My husband had a low key quiet break with walks in the garden and coffee in the lounge and he found the staff friendly and attentive. There was always a morning paper available and a takeaway coffee station as you leave breakfast which we both found to be a quirky touch. My son and daughter in law joined us on the second day and they had an amazing time also. It was a great break made even better by the hotel facilities but more particularly the staff, they simply couldn’t do enough for us.  We were so impressed that we have booked to return again in August. We are really looking forward to returning and thank you Powerscourt for an excellent stay.",5,2018,02,07
217,An Amazing Luxury not far from home,"We stayed at the hotel 2 - 4 February for my husband's Birthday, being in the travel industry we are lucky to travel a lot however the hassle involved in airports / or long drives especially for a weekend break tends to put me off. Powerscourt is just perfect, only 40 minutes from home, with a nice lunch stop in Johnny Foxes en route. Check in was speedy and efficient , a lovely welcome from Tatu who brought our bags to the room.
Superb room overlooking the waterfall, sumptuous bathroom with double sinks, lovely products, fab bath and the best bed I have slept in for ages. Hotel was mega busy, we had a few lovely glasses of wine in the Sugar Loaf Lounge as the sun went down. Not cheap but what you would expect from a 5 star Hotel.Dinner at Sika was an amazing experience, Goats cheese, Venison , and Parfait along with a to die for cheesboard and Albarino wine which was out of this world. Service was 5 star and we went to bed extremely happy. Treatments on both days ( full body massages some of the best I have ever had) Spa area very clean with lovely low lighting and a great idea to have dedicated family time for the kids. The gentlemen who drove us down town and collected us were great fun and so kind and the service was unreal . A really nice touch!, dinner on the second night could not live up to the first or so I thought,  but it did in spades,  and it was crazy busy with parties. The only downside for us was breakfast, I would expect breakfast cooked to order at a hotel of this calibre , not buffet style which was very average , we both ordered cooked eggs, poached and Benedict and they were cold and hard. In fairness the staff are so lovely we did not complain as it was so busy, asking clients to prebook a breakfast slot may be a better idea to alleviate the queues, we did not bother with breakfast on the 2nd day, as we were still so stuffed from the night before. so thank you to all at the Hotel for an amazing weekend made even better by a rugby win, we will be back soon",5,2018,02,07
217,Great 5 Star Experience! ,"
 
 

 
This was our second visit to Powerscourt and we found so many changes this time round, simple little touches that were so unique. We received the usual warm welcome and a beautiful room with a little chocolate surprise and a nice welcome back card which was a lovely touch. We visited the bar shortly after arrival and it was surprisingly very busy for the middle of the week. It is like a little traditional Irish pub situated in the middle of a luxury five star hotel, it shouldn’t work but it really does!  We had a short wait for a table but the lady serving us was friendly and efficient. The food was delicious and it really is a great option if you are not in the mood for a fine dining experience. We actually dined twice in the bar it was that good. We had booked spa treatments and we enjoyed the whole experience. The ladies and gents in the spa were very welcoming and explained everything in detail which really is needed as it is a big place with various rooms and experiences to access. There is a little café in the spa also which I thought was great if you did not wish to wander through the hotel in your robe for a coffee between treatments. We visited the Powerscourt Gardens next door to the hotel and it was a really great experience. It was a lovely (slightly chilly) day but the grounds and craft shops were lovely. There is a ten euro charge to access these but I felt it was really worth it and it was a great way to spend a few hours. We also had lunch there which was welcomed after a big walk. There is plenty to do in the surrounding area and we found the staff most helpful when recommending places to visit or dining out options. Essentially nothing is too much trouble for the staff and we really felt that as we wandered between the areas within the hotel. Our TV remote batteries needed to be changed and it was attended to immediately, along with a few other minor requests nothing was left unaddressed. I know in a five star resort you expect and pay for a high level of service but alas we have not experienced that in many similar properties in Ireland.  We really got the sense that the hotel appreciated our business and to be welcomed back along with the little touches in our room was special to us. We would recommend the hotel and hope to visit again soon.

217,"Beautiful location, spa too full","Beautiful location in Wicklow, all rolling hills and lots of nice walks around the hotel. The food in the restaurant was good. The spa however was very overbooked, noisy and full, this should be addressed as it was not a relaxing experience.",3,2018,02,07
217,Superb!,"I cannot speak highly enough of this hotel. From start to finish we experienced five star luxury at it's best. Having stayed in another luxury hotel in Dublin recently there really is no comparison between the two. We were warmly welcomed on arrival and whisked away  to our room. We were given a complimentary room upgrade and we were delighted with the room. We had a few issues navigating the electronic curtains and systems but soon mastered it! The bathrooms are large and beautifully finished with a TV in the mirror which is a new and exciting teeth brushing experience! The room  itself was spacious, luxurious and spotlessly clean. We ate in both the bar and the Sika Restaurant and both were faultless. The nachos in the bar really are for sharing and were more than enough for two people. The service was quick and efficient and  the music in the bar actually kept us there much longer than we intended to stay!  I enjoyed a hot stone massage in the spa on our last day and it was amazing. I cant remember my therapists name but it was a gentleman and a true expert at that. I would definitely recommend booking a treatment before you arrive as I would have enjoyed more treatments but it was so busy I had to contend with just one. I would highly recommend this hotel and I am so glad that I chose to stay here. Thanks to all the staff and hope to see you soon again!",5,2018,02,07
217,"Fabulous Hotel, lovely girls break away","Just back from a luxurious break at Powerscourt Hotel where we celebrated a special birthday for one of my friends. I cannot recommend this hotel enough. From the warm professional check in to Brian's farewell handshake and everything in between it really was a 5 star experience. Our bedroom was amazing, spacious with the most comfortable beds. We overlooked the garden fountain and the Sugar Loaf mountain which was a spectacular view to wake up to. We had casual bar food in McGills on Friday evening and lunch there on Saturday afternoon also. The menu is very tasty, varied and reasonably priced. The Chicken Wings were up there with the best i have ever had.  Something to suit everyone. We treated ourselves to a massage in ESPA on Saturday morning. I have to mention Samantha, she was excellent,  i enjoyed my massage so much that i still feel relaxed. I would highly recommend her, such a lovely girl too which always makes a difference. We relaxed in the thermal suite overlooking the Sugar Loaf and pool areas afterwards which was just what we needed to unwind further. We had a stroll around the stunning grounds in the afternoon, the fresh air was needed after out morning of pampering followed by dinner in Sika restaurant. This did not disappoint. Food and service were second to none. Jamie looked after us well. He was attentive, professional with a little added cheeky charm. Thank you to everyone for looking after us. We really enjoyed our stay and look forward to staying in Powerscourt again soon.",5,2018,02,05
217,Wonderful stay,"I’ve just returned from a wonderful weekend in Powerscourt and can not commend it highly enough. From the moment we arrived we were treated like royalty, our room was amazing and spotless, food in both the bar and the restaurant was absolutely delicious (we had breakfast, lunch and dinners in hotel and all were great), spa was fabulous and staff throughout the hotel could not do enough for you (especially our waiter Jamie in the restaurant who was just lovely). Thank you Powerscourt, it was a wonderful treat to stay with you. ",5,2018,02,05
217,Very poor service,"We stayed in Powerscourt on Saturday (February 3rd) for one night with breakfast included. The location and rooms were beautiful and what you would expect for a 5 star hotel.  However the service did not met our expectations and resembled that which you would expect from a 2/3 star hotel.

We decided to eat in the bar on Saturday night which was busy. We had to wait for table which was absolutely perfect with us and we ordered our food as we waited. When we got a table we quickly told the waitress that had taken our dinner order. The table was never cleared and our food arrived to a table full of the tableware from the previous customers. We ate our dinner (the food was lovely) however we were again left waiting for a dessert menu and eventually we had to request it. We ordered dessert and again the table was very slow about being cleared. We went to the bar to pay the bill and to order drinks during the night and the service was extremely slow for both.

The next morning we went for breakfast at 10.00 to the room down stairs. There was a queue and the gentleman at the door advised us that we could get breakfast in the reception area and that it was exactly the same as the buffet breakfast served downstairs. We agreed and went with this option, we then heard the same man tell another customer that the breakfast was different in both areas. We ordered tea which was cold when it arrived, we got our breakfast which was also cold and I mean cold not tepid. My friend told the waitress about our issues. The gentleman who appeared to overseeing the area came to offer his apologies. He dealt with it very well and was very apologetic. He asked if he could get us anything we made one very small request (for some fresh bread) which we are still awaiting to receive!!!

Having stayed in Powerscourt previously I have to say the service has disimproved greatly and I honestly would be very reluctant to ever stay in Powersourt again or indeed to recommend it to anyone else.",2,2018,02,05
217,Pretty hotel in a beautiful location.,"This hotel was just right for a 2-night break.  The rooms are lovely, we were in a suite and it had everything you needed.  The spa is delightful, the relaxation room has wonderful views.  In fact the area is just beautiful. It is just beside Powerscourt House which has stunning gardens - even in January it was lovely to walk around. We ate in both Sika restaurant and McGills bar and the food was quite good.  The only quibble was the service in Sugar Loaf bar on both nights.  ",4,2018,02,04
217,A no star experience!,"I won our visit to Powerscourt hotel and therefore wasn't sure if I should post this review. Our experience was really so poor I felt I should share. There is a long litany so I'm going to condense as far as possible. The service in the lounge area was simply awful. We waited 20 mins for a drink. Asked another waiter to check on it for us. He then brought them and five minutes later the original order arrived! We asked one of the staff directions to the spa. She told us she didn't know and walked away! The spa was completely overbooked. After her treatment my daughter tried to find a bed in the serenity room to find there was a cue waiting for beds. She had to just leave. 
Breakfast was the breaking point. We checked our info booklet for what time breakfast ended to find it was 11am. We arrived at the restaurant at 10.20 to find a cue waiting to be seated. A waiter was telling the couple at the top of the cue they would have to go to the lounge for breakfast. They were telling him they had already tried and been sent back to the restaurant. Time passed and nothing was happening so I decided to check with the lounge. A waitress told me she did have a table for 2 as long as we realised we could 'only have whatever was left'. We were hungry so I called my daughter to join me. Only then did we realise just how little was left. No fruit, orange juice , decent bread practically nothing.  There was black and white pudding, eggs that would have bounced if you dropped them. We made ourselves toast with sliced white bread begging butter from a waitress. It was so bad it was almost laughable. We nearly expected Basil Fawelty to appear! There was a piece of bread on the floor. All the staff walked around it or stepped over it but nobody picked it up. 
We had an expectation of a five star pampering break, what we experienced was the worst hotel stay we had ever had the misfortune to endure. We did apprise the manager of our feelings and he did offer to upgrade us if we ever visited again. That is very unlikely! If I had been paying for this  stay I would have been really furious. 
Am amazed and disappointed a five star hotel could deliver such shoddy service. Avoid.",1,2018,02,04
217,"Brilliant stay, can’t wait to go back","Have gone here once or twice before and can’t wait to go again. Luv going down here. It’s a great part of the country and a must stay if visiting Ireland. Right from when you drive into the car park, u know it’s quality. Checkin/reception is very efficient. The rooms are so nice and bed is fantastic. The highlight was f the stay was the pool/spa area. Amazing pool/sauna area, very relaxing. 
Got food in the bar area, was top of the range, steak v v nice. Good relaxed vibe in bar. Breakfast amazing, really nice fry. Don’t mis it. ",5,2018,02,04
217,"Lovely hotel, food disappointing ","Hi, we stayed in the hotel for the one night b&b with dinner package, our room was upgraded and we stayed in a suite which was really lovely and loads of space. We were on 2nd floor so view from window was the wall of the next building, which was pity considering the setting. Also used the spa, total immersion package, which was really good, the sauna wasn't working which was a bit disappointing. 
My only negative was with the food in the sugar loaf lounge for our dinner. The layout of the menu is a bit confusing, the choice isn't great, and the quality wasn't what I was expecting. We had the Caesar salad for starter which was just average, my husband had the linguine with tomato/chilli, there was barely any taste of chilli, I had the salmon with a hollandaise sauce which had started to congeal a bit, the deserts were nice, but nothing was amazing, which for the price of the package I would have expected.
Breakfast in Sika in the morning was much better. 
It's an expensive package to be disappointed with the meal and don't know if I would come back again, even though the setting is stunning and the staff and service were very friendly.

217,Spa break with my friend,"Room gorgeous , staff fabulous especially Tatu conceirge, enjoyed a beautiful mindfulness spa professionally delievered by Bushra. Lovely atmosphere, hotel located in a wonderful part of the country. Relaxation room after the treatment was lovely too.",5,2018,02,01
217,afternoon tea,"came here for afternoon tea over the weekend,great way to spend the day catching up with friends that you have not seen in a long time. always wanted to stay here and I will for sure find a reason to very soon! afternoon tea was delicious.although some crockery was mismatching but the lovely lady in the dress that served us said that plans for new afternoon tea plates and all that is coming very exciting
Martin who served us was lovely and very charismatic! cannot wait to find a reason to come back SOON fingers crossed",5,2018,01,31
217,A weekend breakaway. ,"My wife and I stayed in Powerscourt on the 25th and 26th of January past. 
We were welcomed by the very friendly uniformed Doorman who organised our luggage transfer and the parking of my car. 
Checking in was simple and efficient. 
Our superior room was a delight, lots of space, beautiful bathroom and comfortable bed and furniture. Both bedroom and bathroom were very well equipped and all of the ‘gizmos’ were demonstrated by a knowledgable member of Staff. 
We had a very nice meal on the Friday night in McGills pub, which is one of the eateries in the Hotel. An excellent meal, great quality and quantity. 
Breakfast was simply wonderful! Take your pick from the Menu on the table; or select from the hot or cold buffets at your leisure. 
We opted for Saturday night dinner in the main restaurant and, again, the food was delicious. 
Sunday morning’s breakfast was a rerun of Saturday’s. It couldn’t be faulted. 
Sitting in the Lobby with a drink or two was the perfect way to spend an evening before retiring. 
The Staff were very helpful regarding maps and sightseeing information. 
Any disappointments? Yes, I was disappointed at the poor selection of beers. Mainstream lagers and, of course excellent Guinness was available but there were no craft ales or beers from the smaller breweries of which there are many in Ireland now. 
Would I return? Absolutely yes. Would I recommend Powerscourt? Absolutely yes! ",5,2018,01,29
217,Gorgeous hotel,"This hotel is stunning.  The decor is fabulous and the sugar loaf lounge is a beautiful place to sit and relax. We stayed in a courtyard view suite which was just really spacious with a large bathroom, living room, dressing room and bedroom.  It was very clean and the decor was really nice and the bed was very comfortable.  There was a tv in the mirror in the bathroom.  The staff were as mentioned by another reviewer very young and maybe not as experienced as in the Shelbourne but I found every single member of staff to be very helpful and obliging.  Special mention must go to Cian who was excellent in Mc Gills bar on a very busy Saturday night he still managed to give excellent customer service.  Overall we had an excellent stay.  We visited The Eniskerry Inn as recommended by another reviewer. We didn’t enjoy the experience, the food was just ok, the service was good and there was a very strong smell like furniture polish.  We were sorry we hadn’t just eaten in Mc Gills bar at the hotel.  We had dined in Sika the previous evening and it was excellent. ",5,2018,01,28
217,Out of this world!,"Stayed for a night with my husband and to say I was impressed would be an understatement! We paid for the cheapest room, breakfast included and dinner. The room was phenomenal. The food and service at both breakfast and dinner was fantastic. We had such a good time! We will definitely be back!",5,2018,01,28
217,Staff issues.,"Beautiful hotel, our room was gorgeous!! Has such potential to be a superior 5 star hotel, unfortunately I found the staff to be lacking.  Was very surprised there was not a bell person to greet us upon our arrival.  My friend and I had to drag all of our luggage to front desk to check in, very surprising!  Staff I had contact with were not as polished/professional you would expect to find at a five star resort.  That being said, the resort is very well maintained and stunning.  Lovely Hotel!",4,2018,01,25
217,Disappointing ,"I’ve been to the hotel quite a few times, both as an overnight guest and also visiting the spa and the restaurant. This time we booked an overnight with dinner and a spa treatment. The room and dinner were both good but we went for a drink after our meal in the sugar loaf lounge and the service was really poor. We waited 20 minutes for our drinks and then had to return them (which is a first for me but they were really awful!) it took another 20 minutes for replacement drinks so we were 40 minutes sitting waiting for a drink. It cost €26 for the drinks that we had to wait 40 minutes for. We weren’t alone, it seemed like every other table had to ask where their order was. The staff seemed very inexperienced (apart from one older man who seemed to be chasing every order) We were asked quite a few times if everything was ok (given that we were 40 minutes sitting with no drinks at our table) but no one seemed to be able to resolve the issue. We highlighted the issue when checking out and the manager apologised but given how much you pay for a night here you would expect a much higher level of service. Was definitely not a 5 star experience unfortunately. ",3,2018,01,22
217,Absolutely Stunning,"I stayed here recently with my partner to celebrate a recent anniversary and we were both very happy with our stay. The staff are very helpful and friendly but the biggest selling point for this hotel is the surrounding area, from the main lobby as we were checking in we caught a glimpse of the sugar loaf. On the second day of our stay we visited Powerscourt house and gardens as well as going on the lovely river walk that was suggested at reception.
The levels of the hotel are a little confusing and finding the McGill's was definitely tricky but when we did find it we were very happy with the food and the surroundings. You would nearly forget where you are. The staff here are a little more fast paced and one waitress in particular seemed a little disgruntled that we wanted to have a drink and browse the menu before eating. When we did eat, however, the food was delicious and servings were very generous!! 
The room was lovely, a television in the bathroom mirror, all of the closet space you could ever need, comfy robes and slippers and if that wasn't enough a fully stocked mini bar (A little pricey but not the worst).
Overall we were happy with our stay but if I were to pick on or two things they would be the following-the entrance to the hotel is a little disappointing, kind of felt like we coming in the back entrance and straight into a car park. The ladies at the leisure centre/spa area were quite rude when approached, I had to wait for their heads to rise from a computer screen and wasn't greeted with a smile or any sort of warm welcome. The pool itself looked lovely but had definitely reached capacity so I decided against using the facility.",5,2018,01,22
217,Classy never disappoint ,"I am a regular in Powerscourt,you can never get tired of this place.I honestly can't fault it especially their friendly staff to comfy clean beds.The food is fab too,I love the little play area for the kids.",5,2018,01,22
217,Not a 5 star hotel service and experience ,"1. The room hasn’t been properly cleaned (hair on the bathroom wall - very gross)

2. Poor management: I booked a horse riding class through the hotel. Upon arrival for my class, Turns out the hotel booked the class in a different school without letting me know. 

3. inattentive staff and poor service 

4. Average quality of food 

",1,2018,01,21
217,Amazing experience with Martin ,We went for afternoon tea for a child free experience and it was absolutely lovely. Our afternoon was completely made with Martin in Sugarloaf who made the day all the more special with his welcoming nature and he gave us the best recommendations on the menu. Next time you visit ask for Martin! The dessert selection is also mouthwatering as well as the poached salmon and the scenic views makes it worthwhile. ,5,2018,01,20
217,Afternoon Tea in December,"Took a day trip to Glendalough (a must do) and stopped at the Powerscourt Hotel for Afternoon Tea. What a beautiful property. Lovely views, and because we visited during the holiday season, the hotel was decorated and gorgeous!  Be sure and make reservations.  Enjoy the lovely fireplaces and grounds and of course the tea was amazing!!!! Enjoy Ireland",5,2018,01,19
217,Loved our stay,"I stayed in a superior room over the weekend with my husband. It was the most beautiful room, very spacious and comfortable. We had dinner in sika restaurant, staff very friendly and helpful, food was delicious but the layout of tables was odd. Very few table for 2 were placed at a table that should be for 4 (like other couples) so we are sat side by side facing outwards rather than at each other. We asked to be moved as soon as a table became available. During out stay we also used to pool, sauna & steam room. There are certain hours that children aren't allowed which is nice when you're having a night away without the kids 😊. The pool isn't really suitable for kids anyway, small enough, rectangular and deep. Breakfast was outstanding and a lovely walk around the grounds finished the trip of perfectly. We will definately be back ",5,2018,01,15
217,"Beautiful Property, nice retreat",Years ago this was a Ritz Carlton and still has the beauty and style to be.  The grounds provide a great escape from the city.   Gorgeous and spacious rooms.  Enniskerry is close for a night out and the hotel provides a free shuttle.  ,5,2018,01,12
217,Lovely treat,"Beautiful grounds, unusual layout building, very spacious hotel. We were there for one night only as a treat for our wedding anniversary, it didn't disappoint! Our room was huge and beautifully decorated, fantastic views of the Sugar Loaf, the Irish one!! Lovely staff too.",4,2018,01,12
217,Hotel layout confusing,"I have stayed here on a couple  of occasions and although the food and service has been good, I always walk away feeling that for the price paid and the reputation the hotel has managed to obtain, then I should have gotten more bang for my buck.  Added to this I find the layout very confusing and would expect more on offer other then Magills if you want to have a drink - I don't think the sugarloaf bar qualifies as a bar!  However the true positives are the sika restaurant and the beautiful rooms- in particular the comfortable bed.  Only negative for rooms is the control panel for lighting - it can be confusing to the point where out of pure frustration and not wanting to phone reception, you could end up taking the bulb out in order to sleep  in the dark!!   If the opportunity is there to visit again then I will.",4,2018,01,11
217,Disappointing - look elsewhere,"This is not the place to go for a relaxing weekend. The pool was crowded and full of children for the most part of the afternoon. There isn't anywhere to lie around and read your book in the spa unless you want to use a lounger at the very edge of the pool to the backdrop of shouting children. It costs €25 for access to the private relaxation room - this wasn't clear in advance. Food was average, breakfast was €28 per person which was categorically not worth it - took ages for coffees, toast etc. to arrive - the wait staff seemed disorganised. Far from what you would expect in such a hotel. Pub grub in McGill's also extremely average. If you're looking for a treat, this is not the place to go. Look elsewhere.",3,2018,01,09
217,watch out for your belongings,"stayed here on the 14th December 2017 for the end of our honeymoon. had a lovely room upgrade and got free chocolates to celebrate our wedding cant complain and the sugar loaf food was lovely. However i left behind my bracelet and necklace and when i rang and emailed the hotel when i got home they told me they had cleaned the room and nothing was found, i gave them a few days to re check the room and still nothing found. Something didnt seem right as i left other things of no value in the room aswell however nothing was handed in by the cleaners. So watch out for the staff cleaners and dont leave things out! we had a lovely stay until this happened which has ruined my view of the hotel. so sorry to say i wouldnt return.",2,2018,01,09
217,Average,"Stayed for two nights in a suite
Staff were very friendly and helpful but the room had a terrible smell of bad drains.
Mentioned it on the Saturday evening before we went out but was still there.
They have a drain issue!
Pub food was excellent and staff very helpful.",3,2018,01,07
217,"Beautiful hotel and setting, some aspects a little below-par","Just back from two nights in this hotel. Third time staying there. The highlights of this hotel are easily the beautiful setting in the powerscourt estate with the sugarloaf in the background, the tasteful and spacious rooms and the lovely main lobby on arrival. In general the staff were attentive and eager to help out. Many aspects of a luxury getaway here (including the price of course). A few issues worth looking at, however. The sika restaurant, while pleasant, doesn't quite live up to fine dining standards, certainly not as good as the Gordon Ramsay experience they used to have. Also the food in McGills pub was definitely disappointing. The gnocci dish was just creamy stodge and the Shepards pie was pretty dry with lots of potato and not so much meat. It really should be possible to get better pub grub here. Breakfast, on the other hand, was very nice with an expansive range of food. The mini bar wasn't restocked when our room was cleaned after the first night, not sure why. Overall very pleasant luxury hotel, and if I could suggest one thing to really work on it would be the food in mcgills. But the location remains beautiful, and will likely return someday, perhaps eating out in enniskerry a bit more next time. ",4,2018,01,07
217,A disappointing afternoon tea,"I recently went here for afternoon tea with some family. The experience was mixed, when we arrived the decor was lovely and set the scene for a nice luncheon. The gentleman that showed us to our table was very pleasant and attentive. 

Once we ordered our helpings of afternoon tea things took a small turn for the worse. We were expecting service befitting of a 5 Star hotel, however, there was a number of mistakes made during the tea. Examples would be staff placing down cups while holding the rim of the mug, reaching across patrons while placing items on the table and table staff picking up our deserts with their bare hands to place them in a takeaway box while standing at the table. Another small detail is that the takeaway box itself is not suitable for the desserts served and a very underwhelming display for a 5 Star hotel.

The atmosphere is quite calm and perfect for having a chat with family, however, I would be reluctant to have afternoon tea there again thanks to the mistakes made.",2,2018,01,06
217,"Beautiful, elegant hotel","What an experience we had at Powerscourt - stunning hotel!
Picturesque views, magnificent grounds, palatial suites, top quality food and impeccable service, this hotel is up there with the best. 
With it being 30 minutes from Dublin, it is the perfect get away where you truly feel at one with nature, but still just a taxi ride to the city.  
Fantastic experience throughout our stay, already can't wait to return! 

P.s. the TV in the bathroom is a wonderful touch!",5,2018,01,05
217,Christmas at Powerscourt,"We arrived in Powerscourt at 4.00 pm on Christmas Eve, check in was faultless. Our suite was fabulous, we had an amazing view of the sugar loaf mountain.  Dinner in Sika was perfect, the food, the music and the so friendly and efficient staff, all faultless.
On Christmas day, we had the grand Banquet , absolutely amazing, food stations included seafood, oysters, fresh salmon and smoked and prawns. Freshly cooked scallops, sea bass and pasta dishes. Meats station, vegetables station, and the most amazing dessert station ever, ever a dessert station for the children!!! At 7.30-8.30 Light bites in the sugar loaf lounge .  We went to the bar later in the evening as it would be a shame not to!!! Great music and trays and trays of sandwiches were served at 11.00 pm.
We did stay for another day, but not included in the package. But what a wonderful way to spend Christmas.Hopefully we will be back agin next year.",5,2018,01,04
217,Terrible Customer Service from MGT ,"Always try to breathe and think when I write in anger as really one should ask oneself is it worth it? This is.

Still staying at this hotel and just been served the worst level of service  from management.",1,2018,01,04
217,Wonderful hotel ,"This a truely wonderful hotel. Spent one night there for my birthday and really enjoyed every minute. Reception staff were so friendly and helpful. The staff in the Sika restaurant could not have been more attentive. The chef sent out a special,slice of chocolate cake with a candle and happy birthday written on the plate. Our room was superb. Large room with big comfy bed. Walk in wardrobe and palatial marble bathroom. The bathroom had 2 sinks, a huge bath, separate shower and toilet. The toiletries were top quality and there was plenty of soft fluffy towels with robes and slippers. Large hd tv with all channels. Seating area and super Mountain View from the window. The food for dinner was excellent and the breakfast was simply amazing. Loved every minute and can’t wait to go back. ",5,2018,01,04
217,Perfect in everyway,My partner and I have stayed at Powerscourt a number of times but most recently for our engagement where we were looked after fantastically by all the staff. They pushed out all the stops to make it a special experience for us. The food in Sika restaurant is beautiful which is often unusual in a hotel restaurant. The spa and leisure facilities are fantastic and worth the visit. The rooms are exquisite!,5,2018,01,04
217,"Fantastic stay overall, let down by some bad service ","Overall, a fantastic stay. We were greeted immediately by a bellboy, and reception staff upon check in (and check out)  were friendly, efficient and warm. Our room on the 5th floor was amazing, very comfortable and with all necessary amenities including a huge bath and a walk in wardrobe area. However, there was no bubble bath which I found odd! I asked housekeeping but they said they don't have bubble bath to give out. I think that's so strange for a 5 star hotel with huge baths! So, bring your own! 

Food was gorgeous in the hotel, especially in McGills. One downside, which I think is a major disappointment,  is that the service in Sika, the Sugar Loaf lounge and the lobby area in general is substandard. Staff don't make eye contact, and if you do get their attention (after physically getting up and stopping someone) then you're lucky if you get your order. I had to ask for our bottle of wine to be put next to our table in Sika as it wasn't being poured for us. I don't expect my wine to be poured for me, however, if it's at the other side of the restaurant then I do!

I'd also recommend signing a receipt after each order as trying to get the bill and sign to your room is impossible! Most of the managers were just walking around ignoring dirty tables and empty glasses, it really wasn't acceptable. The only manager I saw dig in and do any actual  work was the man in McGills.

The Spa was amazing, I had the 2hr signature treatment and the girl who looked after me, Dangoule, was phenomenal!

The beautiful River Walk is well worth doing, any of the reception staff will be able to tell you about it.

If anyone wants to venture out of the hotel, the picturesque village of Enniskerry is a 15 minute walk, mostly flat followed by downhill into the village (that means uphill for a little bit on the way home!). There are a few lovely shops, cafes, restaurants and bars. We had pub grub in The Enniskerry Inn which I'd highly recommend. They also have 2 open fires which is a plus on a cold, damp day!

Bring your walking shoes anyway because the grounds in general of Powerscourt Estate and Gardens are just gorgeous. ",4,2018,01,03
217,Shared Meal with Friends in Hotel Restaurant ,"Invited to this Hotel on a cold, bright winter's day, we were only too happy to make the 55km round trip.  Though the last 3km on twisting roads was somewhat tight, we arrived here in plenty of time to tour the Hotel gardens and to take in the wider views of the 'Garden of Ireland' in its midwinter prime.  With appetites thus primed we adjourned to one of the private rooms here to replenish ourselves.  For starters, we both had the smoked cod fishcake (which was excellent); for mains I went for the hake (yummy), while the Good Lady was somewhat underwhelmed by the chicken; for afters, I opted for the (deconstructed) bread and butter pudding (the texture seemed to get 'lost in deconstruction' and the chocolate overwhelmed somewhat), with the Herself seeming to think that the base of the Pecan Tart was a tad on the substantial side.  Thus satisfied, we bade farewell and left in some haste, trepidatious of the unlit, snaking trail back to main road in the gathering hibernian dusk.",4,2018,01,03
217,Great way to start 2018,"I was initially apprehensive about leaving Dublin for our New Years Eve celebration lunch, however I didn't realise how close it was to the City.  I Had a lovely lunch with my wife in Sica before upstairs for cocktails in the Powerscourt lounge. The hotel was so beautiful and although after the Christmas period, there was still a lovely festive feeling. This was only added to by the lovely staff that made our New years eve much more enjoyable. Leo in particular. The drinks were delicious and I would love to make this a new tradition with my family. Will 100% be back.",4,2018,01,02
217,AMAZING!,"I went to Powerscourt Hotel in December with some family after being away from Ireland for a few months and it was the best decision I could have made. Staff were polite, funny and very helpful.

100% recommend and will be going back for a longer stay. (Was there 1 night and 2 days)

217,Wonderful hotel!,"My husband and I stayed just for one night but will definitely be back. The room was amazing and the bed so so comfy. The pool and spa were heaven!

217,Poor service,"My husband and I booked Powerscourt Hotel for one night to celebrate our wedding anniversary! Beautiful hotel, a very warm welcome and our room was lovely! However, that's where it stops. The service in the foyer and restaurant was unforgiving considering it was a five star hotel!  It was at least a 20 minute wait to get our pre dinner drinks followed by a 45 minute wait for our main course which was not ordered until the waiter asked if we would like to see the desert menu! After dinner we sat in the foyer which was littered with used glasses etc! Breakfast was cold and tasteless. The maitre de spent his time running food from the kitchen to the buffet and trying to calm disgruntled residents!  We were disappointed to say the least! ",2,2017,12,29
217,Stunning hotel and surroundings,"Our stay at Powerscourt was truly magical! From the moment we arrived to the moment we left, everything from the hotel, the food and spa were just amazing and we loved every second. I'd highly recommend having lunch or afternoon tea at the Sugar Loaf Lounge as it looks out to the mountains and the view is just spectacular!! We can't wait to return",5,2017,12,29
217,Buckley family,We had the pleasure of staying Xmas eve and Day with our 2.5 yr old daughter. She was greated with a santa carrot for thw door and A warm welcome at reception. Tatu the doorman was extremily helpful. The room was superb with excellent room service.  We used the leisure facilities on 2 occassions both excellent. Spa staff on duty could not have been more attentive and helpfull. I was very impressed wuth the gym.by far one of the best hotel gyms ive seen. Christmas day buffet was 10/10 wonderfull selection which could not be faulted.  Entertainment excellent with attentive service from staff especially the Banquet Manager on duty who acknowledge his customers twice asking if we needed anything.  The bar was very enjoyable. Breakfast superb with A wonderfull selection and very good service. We would happily stay again and reccommend powerscourt.  ,5,2017,12,28

217,Brilliant all the way!!,"Booked in for Christmas this year with the kids and the wow started at the front door.  The doorman and porters welcoming everybody was fantastic, the decor so warm and festive. We had an amazing dinner in the ballroom last night with some very fun musicians to set the scene. Food was great and this morning even special Santa stop here signs for the kids to put on the door. We have just finished an amazing breakfast as the kids were up at the crack of dawn! Great staff, friendly and attentive. 

Only issue in a hotel like this and when staying away is the odd grinch family but hohoho they are not the norm

Very impressed and will certainly return.",5,2017,12,25
217,Disappointed ,"We stayed here for our first wedding anniversary last Saturday and while the hotel itself was lovely the extremely poor service we encountered just really took away from our overall experience. The poor service was consistent from our lunch in the sugar loaf, to dinner in the restaurant and breakfast the next morning. Considering the reputation this hotel has and the money that they charge i expected much more efficient service. 
I would certainly return to the spa again however we did not feel for the money we left that we had the wow experience like we have received in other 5 star hotels we have stayed in Ireland.

217,Thanksgiving in Ireland ,"This was our third time to this hotel and it continues to be a spectacular place with some of the most beautiful gardens and golf I’ve ever seen just footsteps away. We shared Thanksgiving at the property and had an amazing dinner that although not quite “typical “, it was delicious. We could not have been more pleased and the entire staff worked very well representing the holidays for all of their guests. I have golfed both courses across the street and both are superb. We ended with a rainbow in the distance. What a way to end a golf outing with my dad and an amazing trip with family. Don’t miss this hidden gem if you have the time.",5,2017,12,21
217,Lunch after walking powers court gardens ,Beautiful hotel. Views are excellent.  Staff very friendly.  Great service.  Thanks Ross and staff. Food was perfect and very reasonable.  Same price as pub in glendalough and this is 5 star. Perfect end to the day. We visited powers court gardens.  Had lunch in the hotel after. My Cypriot friends loved it,5,2017,12,21
217,Underwhelmed ,"My partner and I stayed at powerscourt last month. My partner had stayed numerous times before...this was my first time.  
After hearing about her previous experiences...I was looking forward to our stay.
The rooms are very large...with amazing bathrooms. My personal feeling was that the rooms felt almost too big...and the entertainment system could be improved (pay per view films etc).
Spa facilities looked amazing...unfortunately we didn't get a chance to use them.
Food - we had reservations at the restaurant...however after seeing the menu and deciding we both wanted something rustic and traditional...we cancelled.  I understand most 5 star hotels will have fine dining style menus...and my partner and I usually like them...but the alternative Irish style bar/pub had a similar style of menu. This left us with only the option of room service.
I left feeling underwhelmed. There was nothing wrong with the hotel but it definitely didn't have the wow factor I was expecting. However, I would stay again.

We will definitely be back.",5,2017,12,18
217,"Beautiful Setting, very friendly staff","Had lunch today in the sugar loaf restaurant, the atmosphere was warm and welcoming and all the staff were friendly and professional.

217,A very relaxing and stunning place,"The hotel location is stunning. The hotel area is actually an estate, where you can walk around in green fields, play golf or generally enjoy the nature. 

I was there for a conference, so i didn't get to enjoy many of the leisure activities, but i definitely recommend the place if you want to have a relaxing weekend away from the city",5,2017,12,15
217,Luxurious getaway,"This breathtaking hotel has an amazingly beautiful garden with a mountainous backdrop and a neighbouring publicly accessible estate. The photographs, all of which are spectacular, will not do justice to the grandiose building and gardens. We booked in here on a Friday night through to Wednesday in early December for a weekend away and a business conference during the week. 

Our suite was incredibly spacious, modern, spotless and very luxurious. Two bathrooms of which the en-suite was spectacular, comfortable lounge with large TV, office space, dining area and huge bedroom also with large TV. It was great value for money and set the scene for the entire stay.

The ambience in the hotel was superb. Cosy fireplaces in a huge reception lobby and a separate lounge for guests taking high tea in the afternoons overlooking Sugar Loaf Mountain. The ground floor has its well kitted out gymnasium and award winning spa and pool. 

Breakfast was run like clockwork, with all you could ask for, served with a smile and an added touch. Dinner in both the traditional bar and restaurant was merely good but this was easily forgiven. 

The neighbouring Powerscourt Estate and surrounding attractions provide ample reasons for leisurely walks. 

Our congratulations to the team behind the scenes and the customer-facing staff providing the service - you are wonderful. Thank you for looking after us during our stay. We hope to come again soon.",5,2017,12,12
217,Customer Service- Exceptional,"Had an amazing time at the Powerscourt Hotel. Really enjoyed the entire spa aspect of our stay, especially the excellent customer service received from Georgia in reception, who couldn't have looked after us any better.

217,"My second time here, it's just amazing!","Just came back from the hotel today and I feel as relaxed as ever after my stay. Our room was very beautiful , the view from the room was breath taking to wake up to. We had dinner in the Mcgills Pub downstairs which was lovely. If you're wondering where to stay in Ireland, this is the place you won't regret it. I'm defiantly coming back next year. Thank you for a wonderful stay",5,2017,12,11
217,Beautiful hotel but incredibly poor staff - do not waste your money!,"My husband and I went to Powerscourt Hotel to celebrate our mini-moon, after getting married just 2 days before. Our only regret of our whole wedding is that we decided to celebrate in the Powerscourt Hotel. 

I have never experienced such poor service, especially at a supposedly 5 star hotel. I have stayed in Premier Inns and received better service from staff. 

We had an endless list of complaints:

- Dinner in the restaurant on the first night: we were incorrectly served sides with our mains, I told the waiter we had not ordered them but he reassured us they were complimentary from the chef. We thought this was due to our mini-moon but 2 minutes later a waiter came over, stated we had not ordered the sides and took them from our table. I can only presume he took them from us to throw them out as they should not have been served to another table. This was embarrassing and hugely disappointing for a 5 star hotel. ""here is a gift.... actually you didnt pay for that gift so we are taking it back""
- Service at breakfast is very poor: some of the waiters we actually found to be incredibly rude. Despite endless requests for toast both mornings they seemed to have difficulty remembering our order. On the second day they even gave our toast, which we had to ask for 3 times, to the wrong table. On this morning there were only 2 other couples in breakfast so it was exactly hectic or difficult for, what should be a, competent waiter to get this order right. Luckily the couple dropped the toast over to us, after hearing our endless requests, as they still had a full serving of toast on their table they presumed it was ours. This only highlighted that staff don't take proper notice of guests.
- Sugar Loaf Lounge: The staff here look through guests. Both days we had to go looking for staff in order to get another drink. Nobody was looking around to ensure guests had what they needed and every so often a waitress did walk around but ignored everyone trying to wave her down.
- Room Service: Tried to order this on our second night and told the line was busy and we would get a call back in 2 mins. We waited 20 minutes before calling again and were then told the same thing at which point we complained because the staff had clearly already forgotten about us. 

We had decided we would raise all of these on checking out however, not too surprisingly, we were only asked for our credit card on checking out, not one person asked us how our stay was. This is incredibly disappointing, especially as we were celebrating our mini-moon.

After staying in a number of 5 star hotels in Ireland I know that this is not the service you can expect from a 5 star, or even a 4 or 3 star. While it is a beautiful hotel I would not waste your money here. It would have been very easy to make us feel special, especially as we only just got married, but the Powerscourt Hotel really took away from that enjoyment.",2,2017,12,11
217,"Luxurious rooms, great dinner, poor breakfast ","Stayed here to begin our honeymoon, fabulous and opulent. Rooms are gorgeous, the bed is one the comfiest I’ve slept in!
Service at reception wasn’t amazing, felt we were inconveniencing them checking in!
Dinner was fabulous, friendly staff and every course was delicious, any of the fish dishes were perfectly cooked.
Breakfast; very disappointing. One of my favorite things about hotels I was excited about this one but it didn’t deliver. There was a buffet to chose from which was basic. No menu to chose from, although the waiter told us we could have different types of eggs, we had poached which were bland and watery, not what I would expect from 5 star. ",3,2017,12,09
217,Beautiful hotel! Top class,"Enjoyed the whole experience. Great food, great service all round quality. beautiful gardens & walkways also.  Great location. The famous Johnnies fox's bar is not to far away. I am looking forward to going back!",5,2017,12,08
217,Loved it ,"From the moment my sister and I entered we loved it. The decor is fabulous, especially with it being Christmas time. We were greeted by a very friendly Roisin, whom upgraded us to a suite. The rooms were lovely. The spa and treatment area is also gorgeous . It was very quiet as it was midweek which really added to it! We ate at the bar which has a laid back chilled vibe but suited us. We didn't want to leave and will definitely be back. ",5,2017,12,07
217,A spectacular gem hidden in the countryside south of Dublin,"This was a perfect location for a conference this week. Beautiful hotel, all decked out in Christmas finery.

Our dinner and whiskey tasting at Powerscourt House was second to none, and a wander through the gardens was very pleasant with the sculptures, and initially the beautiful view to the Sugar Loaf.

I'll definitely be back with my wife - this strokes me as a bit of a romantic getaway hotel as well",5,2017,12,06
217,Has dis-improved,"Stayed here a few times over the years and feel that the service this year has decreased. The waitresses at the Sugerloaf were very very slow and this really let things down........... they were not efficient , they walk around really slowly and you are left waiting forever for anything......this needs to be addressed.
Sika restaurant is too expensive for the quality of food.
The water from the tap in my room smelled of sulphur ............it was horrible............ the water in the bottles in the room were out of date ............
Spa treatments are crazy price!! rip off...........

I usually come here very year but next year I don't think I will........",3,2017,12,06
217,Amazing hotel,Absolutely stunning hotel attended the Security Institute awards here and was blown away with the place. Amazing rooms and gardens were stunning. The breakfast was out of this world so much to choose from. The only negative thing was the receptionist that booked me in was very impersonal possibly caught her on a bad day she looked like she didn't want to be in work that day. A warm welcome goes a long way. I'd highly recommend a break here I will be back. ,5,2017,12,05
217,Excellent experience on our anniversary,"We stayed in Powerscourt for an anniversary getaway break. The hotel was an amazing experience. Immediately from entering the gates of the overall Powercourt Estate the sense of escape hit us. Once we arrived at the hotel we were greeted by the friendly door staff and further by the reception staff. We had a suite with a balcony garden view which gave amazing views out towards the Sugar Loaf. The food and hospitality was amazing, from the breakfast, to afternoon tea in the lobby and onwards to Sika restaurant for an evening fine dining experience. We also had food in McGills Pub which was nice for a more casual experience and a great Guinness. Finally I have to mention the Pool and Spa facilities which offered a great place to unwind and relax. Overall we had a great experience in Powerscourt and cannot wait to go back.",5,2017,12,05
217,Very disappointed ,"I have visited this hotel on many occasions, from when it was the Ritz Carlton and have many fond memories. However, the past two visits I have paid over the past year I have been left utterly disappointed due to the incredibly poor service in the Sugarloaf Lounge. Over the weekend my Mother and I were left waiting 45 minutes for a pot of tea and a couple of deserts, and we only received them as I had to walk up and remind the waitress. We didn’t receive an apology or anything. Very unprofessional staff working there, they seem more interested in texting and giggling behind the bar - It feels like you’re in a run down cafe. The 3 stars go merely towards the beautiful physical aspects of the hotel and my positive experiences with other staff members. Otherwise, very disappointed in the downgrade of standards.
",3,2017,12,04
217,Stunning setting and magnificent hotel,"We did a lot of travelling this year and stayed at a number of fine hotels. Powerscourt ranks up with the best of them. We had a corner Mountain Suite with separate eating and sitting areas, two baths, patio, and a large bedroom. The grounds, including the golf courses and gardens, set this hotel apart. It felt like the Greenbrier in West Virginia. The staff could not have been more helpful or courteous. Breakfast was excellent. The only negative I experienced was dinner. It was fine, it just did not shine like I had hoped.
Would we stay there again? Absolutely. Would I recommend it to my best friend. Positively.",5,2017,12,02
217,Fabulous ,"Business meeting & dinner with 40 colleagues.From start to finish a fabulous experience. Staff, facilities, food all excellent . Would return at first opportunity 

Excellent all round, stayed in Carton house recently, not a patch on this",5,2017,11,29
217,Great hotel pity about the food !!,"Beautiful hotel, staff were fantastic we had a suite which was amazing. The hotel looked so Christmasy and it smelled of pine they must have a pine defuser somewhere because the trees were artificial,it looked  really beautiful. Our room was huge the bed was SO comfortable we slept like babies 👶 the bathroom have everything that you could need . We had dinner in the restaurant and breakfast the next morning and I have to say we where quite disappointed. We both had ribeye, firstly it didn't look like ribeye both of our steaks had stringy veins running through them also the sides were tiny. The breakfast was mostly good the selection of fruit was nice but the hot breakfast was old, hard and needed to be thrown out. You'd have taught that a five star hotel would have been able to serve up a fresh Irish breakfast. 
I loved this hotel apart from the food.",3,2017,11,28
217,Fantastic property,Stayed here last week. Rooms are fantastic and spacious. Might need some electrical upgrades with charge points etc. Breakfast was really good with an excellent variety. It is very quiet and relaxing here so don’t expect a bustling atmosphere. It’s a great location to enjoy a break from Dublin and explore some of the sights of Wicklow.,4,2017,11,26
217,Was Hoping for Better,"We chose to stay at the Powerscourt instead of a hotel within Dublin due to the spacious rooms and how beautiful it looked online. Overall, it was an ok hotel but definitely not worth the money spent to stay there. 

The Good:
- The rooms were very large and spacious, with fantastic bathrooms
- The grounds of the property were absolutely beautiful. Plenty of places to walk around and explore
- The hotel has a shuttle car that will take you into the village of Eniskerry where you can then take the bus into Dublin in an easy trip
- McGill's was convenient with great food and service 

The Bad:
-The rooms need some serious updating. There was mold in our shower, and the wallpaper was falling off the walls.
- We went down for breakfast one morning, and the hostess told us that they were serving breakfast in the lower level as well. When we asked her if she would rather us go downstairs, she said it was fine and sat us upstairs. After seating us, no one came around once to take our orders or even see how we were doing even though there were 3 waitresses around our area. 
",3,2017,11,25
217,Very Impressive,"Stayed for a Wedding and had a good time. The hotel is big and has great facilities. Almost too big. Even the wedding of 140 people seemed to get a little lost in the large function rooms. The staff were professional. The bedroom/suite was huge with separate dressing room and superb bathroom. We walked over to the neighbouring Powercourt gardens which was lovely. This hotel is 5 star but lacks the warm, inviting feeling you would expect from a high end hotel in Ireland. The staff could help warm up the character of this hotel. Note: The touch control console for lighting, in the bedroom, is a little old fashioned and not so intuitive.",4,2017,11,23
217,superb hotel,"rooms and view is gorgeous.need to book the spa before visiting as it gets very busy..the bathroom is lovely, however..might be nice if hotel can provide portable shower chair for person with mobility issues(for a 75 yr old)/bath is too high for her as well..overall excellent.the staff are always nice and polite",4,2017,11,23
217,"Staff, Facilities and Location","Stayed in the Powerscourt Hotel last weekend, 17/18 November, I don’t make a habit of reporting on hotels, restaurants and the like. However on this occasion I feel I have to. From the moment I arrived to the time we checked out my friends and I had a wonderful stay. Full marks to the staff, house keeping, bars, restaurant and spa, can’t say enough about them other than thank you. 
Room, general hotel facilities, its location near Enniskerry and of course Powerscourt House all made our stay most enjoyable. I understand the hotel lobby area had a refurbishment recently, looked great and was very comfortable. Well done to all and once again, thank you.",5,2017,11,22
217,Best Hotel In Ireland,"My husband and I have just got back from a stay at Powerscourt and we absolutely loved it. It is set in the most beautiful grounds with stunning views from the rooms. 

We flew into Dublin airport and it took us around 40 minutes to get there by car, so it’s very convenient. 

I’ve stayed in a number of hotels in Ireland and would recommend this one to anyone visiting; I found the staff to be very efficient and polite throughout. 

The rooms are spacious and the bathrooms are out of this world - there is even a TV in there! 

There’s plenty to do in the surrounding areas: we visited Powerscourt Gardens and the largest waterfall in Ireland. There’s also some lovely walks and jogging routes that the concierge kindly gave us. 

We ate in both Sika and McGill’s and each night we had a beautiful meal. 

Thank you to all of the staff who made our trip perfect. We’ll be back!",5,2017,11,22
217,Very Disappointing!,"We stayed at the Powercourt on our last night in Ireland--we selected the Powercourt as we did not want to go back into Dublin and it appeared to be a lovely property.  We were there for only an afternoon and evening and did not have time to sample the golf course, so my comments only apply to our stay in the hotel and not the golf amenities that may be the reason many stay at this property.  First, I did not like the architecture or the floor plan of the lobby area.  The architecture is simply out of place in the country side and the hotel and lobby come across as somewhat harsh and cold--just nothing warm and inviting about it.  So unlike all the other places that we stayed in during our Ireland trip.  Second, the room was spacious and well appointed, but again, not inviting and came across as a bit sterile and cold.  Third, as others have commented, I thought the service was simply terrible--absolutely no excuse for poor service in a luxury hotel.  The staff seemed to be disorganized and the left not talking to the right.  There was clearly a lack of adult supervision, i.e., management, over the staff.  And, the hotel was not busy at all or at capacity when we were there.  We had lunch when we arrived and the service was simply painful.  We were told multiple different information about the shuttle service into town which was then contradicted by the next person we talked to.  The concierge was somewhat non existence and when he was available, he was not particularly helpful.  Additionally, he convinced my wife that we needed to be at Dublin Airport 4 hours before our flight for the checkin and customs process!  I challenged this and even called the Dublin Westin who stated that 2 hours is adequate!  But, at this point, I could not convince my wife otherwise, so we left at 6:00 AM in the dark, were at the airport with car turned in by 7:00 and totally checked in and through US Immigration and Customs 45 minutes later, and sat for 3 hours waiting for our 11:00 flight. When I checked in at Delta, I was told that you should arrive 90 minutes before your flight at that time of year!  Again, not sure I would regard anything that any of the service staff said at the Powercourt!  Fourth, the surrounding area is beautiful and well worth the walk through the gardens which are simply amazing!  The town is also very nice.  Overall, I was totally underwhelmed and most disappointed in the service, especially at the cost to stay.  I would not stay again nor recommend to others.  Again, as I said earlier, we did not have time to golf and perhaps that experience may have balanced out the poor hotel experience!",2,2017,11,21
217,Drop in standards,"I have stayed here quite a few times, and have always loved the hotel and been pleased with everyone, but on a recent visit I was quite shocked after visiting.
The cleanliness has gone down hill massively our room in the drawer were the coffee and tea amenities are kept had spilled coffee granules all over it, and a huge unsightly stain on the floor of the carpet by the bed, was quite off putting. 
When we went to relax in the spa, we found the little ruby coloured candle ornaments where covered in a thick layer of dust, which you wouldn't expect to find in a 5 star hotel.
In saying this, we would have put it down to a busy weekend but the service was the worst part of the stay.
Upon check out I went to the lounge area to soak up the views and ambience of the place, but was told I couldn't sit in any of the tables, of which maybe 10 where empty. 
When I asked the hostess to point me in the direction of another seat, which she did but after waiting for over 10 minutes I went back to where she was standing at her podium, to ask if they did table service, as they normally do, to which she replied she would b over in a bit, she then proceeded to clear 3 dirty tables, and rearrange newspapers and serve other guests, so I flagged the attention of a young lady in a suit, who was not friendly at all but seemed bothered to be asked for help.
Overall I waited 30 minutes for service and when my order arrived it was incorrect, I didn't mention it as the ordeal had been stressful enough as it was-not what one would expect from as establishment that boasts luxury and 5 star service.
My partner also joined me after but his presence was not acknowledge d and he was unable to order anything.
Paying the bill was another dilemma and I had to walk to bar to pay even though 3 staff members were standing laughing and chatting and watched me walk past to pay without intervening in the slightest.
Really disappointed as this is not the norm at the hotel, but has left me where I will seek better value for money in other 5 star hotels.",2,2017,11,20
217,Not 5 star service ,"Powerscourt Hotel is a beautiful facility in gorgeous woodland setting. But it absolutely does not have 5 star service. Amenities are excellent but the calibre of staff training is very poor throughout the hotel. It’s a hotel management issue as all the staff are friendly and kind but they completely lack the polish of 5 star hotel service. Breakfast was a “faulty tower” experience with a 3 star food offering in the main lobby where we had to request everything from table settings, glasses, teaspoons etc. Quite disappointing given the price we paid for the stay.",2,2017,11,19
217,Anniversary break ,"We stayed in this hotel for 2 nights and the staff went out of their way to make this a truly enjoyable stay as a valued guest, the food was delicious and the spa facilities are right up there with some of the best.",5,2017,11,13
217,A hidden jewel,"Another amazing stay, this Resort has everything from amazing rooms, choice of food options, golf, and this time we indulged in Spa treatments which were so relaxing I woke myself up snoring several times during the treatment!  Can't wait to come back 😀",5,2017,11,13
217,We will be back!,Just home after a return visit to our favourite hotel! Can fault nothing about our stay. One bedroom suite was fabulous. The spa was relaxing and the food was superb. Really enjoyed the bar food in McGills bar and it is a lovely relaxed area for a drink. Can’t wait for our next stay! ,5,2017,11,11
217,Lovely stay but some minor issues,"We were upgraded to a mountain view room on arrival which was a lovely surprise. Our room was big, nicely decorated and had lots of storage space.THowever, as this is 5 star and you pay a high premium, I expect a 5 star treatment. The room only had 1 wine glass, although there was two of us. There was no coffee machine which is now places in most 3 star hotels, never mind 5 star hotels. There was only 4 little cartons of UHT milk. They are tiny and I would highly suggest leaving double this amount in the room. I understand these are very small things but equally they shouldn't be an issue to rectify.

We had a 3 course meal in the Sika restaurant and I thought it was beautiful from start to finish. Would highly recommend the Chocolate sphere for dessert, it was delicious.

We had breakfast the following morning and what a disappointment. The fried eggs were cold and the bacons was dripping in excess grease. The sausages looked undercooked. 

We also used the swimming pool, sauna and steam room and they were all lovely and extremely clean.

Overall, we did enjoy our stay. It's a beautiful hotel but they seriously need to sort out their breakfast.",4,2017,11,10
217,Beautiful hotel in lovely location,"Spent one night in this hotel ,  first visit, this was formerly a Ritz Carlton now a Marriott.  Rooms large and comfortable overlooking gardens and sugar loaf , little dated design wise.  Spa pool was lovely . Dinner is a choice between a fake Irish bar and a restaurant.. the restaurant was our initial choice but the Maitre D was sniffy and unfriendly, reluctantly gave us a table which was situated under some very strong lights. We hadn’t reserved a table but we were guests , restaurant was empty. Feeling unwelcome we retreated to the kitchen bar restaurant... this was freezing cold but the food was ok. Why does a hotel if this calibre not have a chic bar area rather than this mock Oirish bar ?   Breakfast was fabulous . 
",4,2017,11,08
217,Birthday treat!,"We have just returned from another most enjoyable visit to Powerscourt Hotel, the occasion being, unfortunately, yet another birthday!  Needless to say, we were not disappointed.  The hotel itself is absolutely beautiful and in a stunning situation within the beautiful Powerscourt estate where, at the moment, the Autumn colours are stunning to say the least. Our room was large, well appointed and spotlessly clean with a gorgeous view to Sugar Loaf mountain. The bed must be the most comfortable we have slept in anywhere!  Dinner in the Sika restaurant was excellent as always, the only criticism being that following the initial pouring of the wine, nobody ever returned to top up the glasses, my husband having to do it himself! In a 5 star hotel this is not to be expected and certainly not acceptable. All in all, apart from that, we had a most enjoyable stay and hope to return in the not too distant future.",5,2017,11,08
217,Fantastic hotel and grounds. ,"We stayed for a 2 night mid-week break and got a great deal from their website. The hotel was immaculate and the staff were always polite and helpful. We ate in both restaurants and the food was also of a high standard and reasonably priced. 
",5,2017,11,08
217,Afternoon Tea,After trying all the usual spots on countless occasions for afternoon tea I felt like a change and so the next spot to hit was Powerscourt. This was my sisters first time to have afternoon tea so I was excited for them. While the food was lovely and the staff very friendly we were left to our own devices a bit too much. I had to ask twice for more water and teabags as only 1 teapot was brought for 4 of us. The staff didn't come and check-in with us. Overall I feel they were a little inattentive.  It seemed like there were enough staff but maybe the management of them was off. There never seemed to be 2 or 3 people at one time on the floor and eyes seemed to be down rather than cast about the room to see if someone was trying to catch their eye. Location alone is amazing but if you want to feel spoilt and well looked after you better stay with the Shelbourne afternoon tea experience - it really is the best for a reason!  ,3,2017,11,06
217,Lovely break,"I stayed at this hotel over the weekend of the 4/5th November. It is truly a luxurious hotel and staff are extremely friendly and attentive to your every need. The room is superb and the attention to detail is second to none. The food is well presented and exceptionally tasty. You could stay in this hotel forever and never want to leave. The room is spotless as is the bathroom. I would recommend this hotel to anyone who wants luxury at an affordable price. 
",5,2017,11,05
217,Very relaxing stay,"My husband and I celebrated our second wedding anniversary in Powerscourt this week. We had an amazing few days. The room was beautiful, the bar was real homely and the spa/fitness area was excellent. The hotel itself is situated in a spectacular area. We spent a day hiking around Glendalough. Enniskerry is a lovely little village with nice cafes. We will hopefully return again soon. I would definitely recommend Powerscourt.",5,2017,11,05
217,Weekend break with my wife ,"I was really looking forward to this trip as I hadn’t stayed here before and there is quite a bit of hype about the hotel. Check in was good and the suite we had booked was well appointed and roomy. After that though one starts to notice the flaws. 

The location is excellent with beautiful walks and scenery but the place is charging 5 Star prices for a 4 Star product. 

So what are the issues that lose it that fifth star then? 

I) I went to get ice and the ice room was filthy. See attached photos 
2) some one had left a glass on a table in the hall and it was there for over 24 hrs
3) the ceiling in the swimming pool area of the spa has obviously been the subject of a leak with visible tide marks (the pool and facilities themselves are excellent) and my wife had a treatment which she said was great 
4) Friday night had food in the lounge but the place is understaffed with people waiting to be seated etc (staff are good though)
5) dinner in the restaurant was excellent - the €45 price tag for a bottle of pic poul made me laugh though 
6) in room food service is good too but seriously overpriced e.g. - €12 for a few chains de France pastries is taking the proverbial 

I don’t mind spend money but if paying top dollar I expect quality. 

As the saying goes you should never meet your heroes and I wouldn’t return. ",4,2017,11,05
217,Never get disappointed with this place!,"Visited here with companys conference and although its my 3rd time in powerscourt hotel  I never got disappointed with this place !

My room this year is abosolutely fab along with a balcony where you can see a nice view ! Also enjoy the bath a lot 🖒",5,2017,11,03
217,"Peaceful, serene","Amazing facilities, great gardens. Very good place to go with friends/family and relax. Breakfast is great. Recommend cycling around the area in the morning. Customer service good too. Rooms are really spacious",5,2017,11,03
217,Serene and Luxurious ,"There are surely not many better situated hotels in Ireland than this hugely impressive hotel that is nestled in the Garden County of Ireland. With a view of forests and mountains and located beside a world heritage site, this hotel is already ahead of the pack. 
Of course it is a Luxury hotel, with all the great things that come with that.
The rooms are the finest we’ve stayed in, and the staff are excellent. Didn’t use the spa or facilities, so can’t comment. We had breakfast, which was really good, but it was the design and beauty of the building and surrounds that really made the place memorable. We certainly hope to return.",5,2017,11,02
217,Overnight Stay,"My husband and I have just returned from an overnight stay in Powerscourt Hotel which my husband booked for my birthday. Overall we were very unhappy with our experience. While the hotel building is beautiful and very impressive, in my opinion some staff members do not provide a five star service. 

A number of issues arose during our stay which included (1) my husband booked a 120 minute massage for me but I only received a 55 minute massage. When we brought this issue to the spa manager's attention she said that she would charge for a 55 minute treatment as opposed to a 120 minute treatment. However, the fact remained that it was a 120 minute massage that was booked (2) We were told that the spa facilities remained open until 9 pm. At 7 pm while relaxing in the serenity room a member of staff came in and simply switched on the lights indicating that it was time for us to leave. The following day on making a complaint about this issue, we were told that the spa facilities only remained open until 7 pm. However, if this is the case a much more polite and appropriate  way, in my opinion, of letting us know that this was the case would have been to have told us while we were relaxing as opposed to simply switching on the lights indicating that it was time for us to leave. (3) At dinner that night our side dishes did not arrive with our mains. We enquired form the waiter where they were and he said that he would go and  get them. He returned approximately 10 minutes later and said that the chef was preparing them.  Another 5 minutes passed before the side dishes were finally brought to our table at which point we had nearly finished our main courses. I told the waiter that I was not at all happy and would be making a complaint in the morning  at which point he shrugged his shoulders. I then asked to speak to the restaurant manger. When the restaurant manger eventually came to our table while he did offer us a complementary drink and said that he would not charge for the sides, he did not seem at all bothered by the fact that our main courses had been ruined. I told him that I was not happy with the matter and would be bringing it to managements attention in the morning. While we ordered desserts we did not enjoy the remainder of our dinner as I was disappointed firstly with the main course and secondly with how he had been treated when I complained. What was supposed to be an enjoyable dinner to celebrate my birthday was anything but. (4)The following day we raised our issues with management. While management listen to our issues and apologised, I do not believe that our complaints were dealt with in a satisfactory manner. The manger removed the main courses and the drinks which we had at dinner from our restaurant bill but we still had to pay for the starters and desserts which we ate despite our dinner and evening having  been ruin. We were also told that the weekday rate was applied to our massages as opposed to the weekend rate but again, the fact remained that  I simply did not receive what was booked. As a result of the actions of the staff and the poor attempt made by management to rectify the issues we did not enjoy our stay and left thoroughly disappointed.",2,2017,11,02
217,Second trip,My second visit to this hotel. Beautiful big and very quiet rooms. Comfortable beds. Staff are mostly excellent. I must compliment Lola in the spa. Lovely girl and probably the best manicure I have ever had. Powerscourt Estate is very lovely. The gardens are beautiful. My only gripe is the food in the hotel. Sika restaurant is very nice. Lovely food and great staff but there is only the option of a 3 course fixed price menu. It was very good but I didn’t want that much food every night. It would be good to have the opportunity to have one or 2 courses. I didn’t visit McGills - the menu did not appeal to me. Breakfast is a buffet. Lots of choice but it feels rushed and a bit like a ‘conveyor belt’. Bacon was dry and hard as was the toast which I sent back. The price is 28 Euros and it should be better for that price in a 5 star hotel. I ate out at Avoca on the other 2 mornings. Cheaper and cooked to order. Room service at the hotel was very good. Overall a very nice break in a nice place just not my cup of tea in terms of food. ,4,2017,10,31
217,Worth every penny,My husband & I had two days of pure bliss at the Powerscourt hotel to celebrate our delayed honeymoon. It was a bit of a luxury but driving in gave the first glimpse of the beauty and magnificence of the location. We arrived and were warmly greeted by the staff and made feel welcome. The room was amazing and the manager left a gift of chocolates and a note in our room which was a lovely though and much appreciated. We had a drink in the sugar loaf looking st the view and didn’t want the moment to end. We had a delicious meal in the Sika restaurant and given the location I thought it was very well priced. Top tip.... the chocolate sphere is worth the calories. We had a very peaceful sleep in a luxurious feather bed. If I could have brought it home I would. The next day we did the river walk and it was idyllic. We rounded off the day in the pool and availed of the courtesy car to visit the village for a bite. Each morning we had a filling breakfast nothing was too much trouble. I have stayed at many hotels and it was a great experience to have each and every member of staff greet you warmly and truly mean it. My sincere thanks to Ian and his crew for a throughly enjoyable time. I have wanted to go for years and I am delighted to have finally gone!,5,2017,10,30
217,First class experience,"It was the first time to Ireland for my wife and I. We are Marriott people so we used points for the hotel and we were not disappointed.

The staff are amazing and can't do enough to assist you.  Breakfast is included in the fee and is outstanding.  Mc Gills pub was good but service a bit slow.

As I said, the Powerscourt staff is tremendous.  Special kudos to Tatu and Robbie Smyth (Concierge) for their suggestions and assistance.  The",5,2017,10,28
217,Great Honeymoon Destination,"We arrived during the middle of Tropical Storm Ophelia.  The hotel was at reduced staff, but they still made sure our stay was all we hoped.  The rooms are incredible - we highly recommend getting a balcony view!  Bigger than my Washington, D.C. apartment and very clean.",5,2017,10,27
217,Fantastic Afternoon Tea,Absolutely amazing - we were residents here Saturday - this was my 4th afternoon tea experience here. The Guinness brown bread and salmon sandwich was amazing...the desserts as always were excellent. Our waiter was beyond excellent but sadly I didn’t get his name. ,5,2017,10,26
217,Treat,"We were 6 Girls for a birthday celebration. Outstanding resort. The rooms were spacious and modern. The pool facilities were the best in any hotel I used. One employed Mossan was exceptionally helpful.
The food was delicious we all had steaks which were amazing. We all had either Fillets and ribeyes all served with butter knives which showed much confidence as they were easy to cut and soft and tender. The sides were plentiful and delicious. Breakfast too was very nice. Poached eggs cooked perfectly to order.
Gym facilities were spacious and clean with modern top class machines. Will definitely return to Powerscourt. A hidden gem in the Wicklow Hills!!!",5,2017,10,26
217,Most relaxing time ,"Myself and my husband arrived for our anniversary, I had checked in online and when we arrived we got our room ahead of time and it was just a beautiful suite, we chilled for hours in the spa and had dinner at 9pm, staff are all amazing and even had a cocktail made up for me by the brilliant staff, breakfast is lovely and as a vegetarian offers lots of choice which is nice. Only wish the sika restaurant offered more of a choice for vegans and vegetarians, as this was very limited, staff where extremely busy and at times under pressure but this is more a lack of staff and not their fault. Had a beautiful stay and will return again. ",4,2017,10,25
217,Great Rooms with OK Food,"The staff at the hotel are extremely friendly and endeavor to be as helpful as possible. We stayed in a 1 bedroom suite. The bedroom was spacious and well decorated as was the living room part of the suite. Bathroom was large with a soaking tub, walk in shower and TV!
An oddity was that we could not go from our first floor room to the restaurants on the third floor. We had to go to reception on the fourth floor and then walk down to the third floor. Of course, we reversed the process for the return trip.
We ate at Sika for breakfast. The first morning we found everything perfect at the buffet. On the second morning, we found several of the ""hot"" dishes to be cold.
For dinner, we bypassed Sika (55 Euros for a three course offering) as we didn't want three course. We at at McGills both nights. Service is excellent and food is ok. Shepherd's pie was very good. Fish and chips only had one piece of fish but chips left much to be desired. Burger overdone and burnt with same complaint of chips.  Food was also a bit pricey. You're paying for the convenience of not traveling into town.",4,2017,10,23
217,Stunning Property,"I have just returned from my 5th trip to Ireland and my 4th stay at Powerscourt.  I always spend at least two nights at this fabulous property.  It is one of my favorites in Ireland.  The staff are professional, friendly and helpful.  The rooms are a cut above most hotels.  I have had the opportunity to stay in a room with twin beds, a room with a king bed and my most favorite with a suite with two bathroom, dressing room, sitting area, balcony looking out on Sugarloaf Mountain and doorbells on each room.  This is the best way to end a holiday in Ireland!",5,2017,10,23
217,We should have scheduled more time here,"My wife and I spent 2 nights at this wonderful hotel.  We should have spent more of our vacation time here as it was completely outstanding.  The rooms were incredible.  The food was quite good.  Walking around the grounds was amazing, and the small city nearby had a couple of fun places to visit.  My wife has asked if we could make a return trip from the US just for this hotel.",5,2017,10,23
217,Fantastic Stay,"Beautiful hotel and room. Excellent service.  Walked to Powerscourt Estate/gardens, which was right next door.  Did not know that hotel guests have access to the Powerscourt estate river walk, and unfortunately did not have time to check that out. Guess we will need to return.",5,2017,10,22
217,birthday treat,"Just spent weekend here with my two daughters. The hotel is amazing, lovely room, service was excellent from Sophie in reception at check in to the lovely and attentive staff in the Sika restaurant Daniel and Julie and also the breakfast staff. We had a very enjoyable time in the Spa and have to compliment Michaela on a terrific massage. Our entire stay was so enjoyable and will definitely stay again.",5,2017,10,22
217,Beautiful hotel with excellent view,"This hotel is superb. The mountain view and garden view from the room window is so beautiful. The mountain view suite we stayed this time is nicely decorated esp the light blue and cream wallpaper. The The breakfast buffet are delicious with a variety of choices. It would be perfect if there's some toast. The staff are friendly and helpful. And it's just two-minute's drive from the hotel to the Powerscourt Gardens. Very convenient. One disappointment  is that there were flies in the room near the windows. I guess it's when cleaning the room, the windows are opened for a while, during which time the flies get into the room. Overall, it's a wonderful hotel.",5,2017,10,22
217,Highly disappointing!,"I stayed at the Powerscourt Hotel on 1 October 2017 - my boyfriend had booked us a mountain view room to celebrate our anniversary and given the reputation of the hotel, we were so excited to visit.

We were guaranteed check-in at 4pm and so we arranged our whole day around this. We travelled 2.5 hours to the hotel and arrived at exactly 4pm, with plans to go to the spa and relax in the room until our dinner reservation at 7pm. However, it was extremely disappointing that our room was not ready until just after  5.30pm - this significant delay is not what you would expect from a 5* hotel. Given this delay, we didn't have time to go to the spa and we had to push back our dinner reservation to allow us to get ready.

I must say that the room itself was beautiful - although it hadn't been thoroughly checked/cleaned prior to us arriving as there were still contents in the fridge from the previous guests. 

When we checked out, we confirmed to the receptionist that no items were taken from the mini bar. However, my boyfriend then received an email at 3am the following day to say that his credit card would be charged for all the items that we had taken - needless to say we were not happy about this given that we had already confirmed that nothing was used.

All in all, the hotel is beautiful but the service lets it down. I also raised my concerns with Powerscourt directly at the time and am yet to receive a reply - again, not the standard you would expect of a 5* hotel.",2,2017,10,21
217,Lord and Lady-Level Elegance!,"From the moment you drive onto the grounds, and are greeted in the lobby (we were Marriott Platinum Elite guests, but I hope you are smothered with 'welcome' as well when you arrive!), you will love this hotel! From decadent suites, TV screens in the bath, and stunning, aristocratic grounds fit for a Lord or Lady, this is an introduction to what true estate living would be like.  One down side - the pub was definitely not becoming such a wonderful hotel - much too 'cockney' to be one in which an Irish Lord or Lady would tipple a pint in (if they fancied a pint, that is!)",5,2017,10,20
217,Exquisite! Holy moly! ,This place is remarkable. The service is impeccable. The grounds are breathtaking. You can walk to the gardens (which is a must see). There is a golf course too for all you golfing fans! The restaurant inside is spectacular. ,5,2017,10,20
217,Great place in a hurricane,"We were scheduled to stay here the day the hurricane hit(first big one since 1839)!  As the wind was blowing all around us, we were trying to find the entrance.  There was a map but it (even according to locals) was a horrible map.  After driving around, we finally found our way in.  While we were frustrated,  the staff quickly changed our opinions!  They were working overtime during the storm to provide the best service they could in spite of being short staffed.  This hotel is beautiful, with fresh fruit and cranberry cider always available!  The prices were a little high for food but seriously, the best hamburger I ever had was in McGill's, their pub on the premises.  We greatly enjoyed our stay, the toiletries they use smell divine!!  I couldn't leave for home without purchasing the wonderful shampoo and conditioner!  ",4,2017,10,20
217,Great Stay at Powerscourt and Wicklow Tour,"We were very pleased with our room, and found it perfectly made-up/cleaned everyday. The staff were always very accommodating. We also reserved a private tour (a 4hr Wicklow tour through the concierge) and our guide - Brian O'Reilly was superb and really showed the ""true"" Ireland to us. He provided much on the local history and his tour included all the wonderful local sites (coastal sites and the Wicklow Mountains). I would recommend this tour to anyone.",5,2017,10,20
217,Luxury accommodations and service,"We stayed here our first night during our 7 day trip to Ireland. We were upgraded to a suite. It was wonderful! We were so exhausted from our log overnight flight. The bedding was the most comfortable of our stay anywhere. I personally loved the soaking tub. I was able to soak away my travel pains and watch tv at the same time. It made me feel like royalty. The room was very clean also. The ESPA bath products were so amazing we bought some to have with us the rest of the trip. We dined at McGills Pub for dinner. The food was out of this world amazing. My mouth is watering just reminiscing about it now! The service was good and they were busy. In the morning we had breakfast in the restaurant by the lobby, the Sugar Loaf, I believe. Again, incredible service and the food was great. We had a lovely table with a view of the gorgeous mountains. We walked down after breakfast to the giant outdoor chess set. We just had to get pictures there to show our kids when we got home. Overall, it was a wonderful start to our trip. Close enough to several activities for our first day. I only wish we had more time to enjoy the spa and pool facilities. There's always next time!",5,2017,10,18
217,Dream Wedding Venue - Thank You,"We got married a little over 2 months ago in Powerscourt Hotel, and all we can say about the whole is experience is WOW! Absolutely flawless. From start to finish it was a dream come through, we were beyond impressed. 

We met with the hotel manager Ian, and the events co-ordinator Jens on a few occasions before the big day and they couldn’t do enough for us. Nothing was an issue, they were incredibly helpful and organised through the whole process which allowed us to thoroughly enjoy the build up to our big day. 

The hotel itself is truly beautiful. A stunning location with such a relaxing ambiance to it. The forest surrounding it, as well as the extremely picturesque Wicklow mountains are the perfect setting for any couple wishing to have their dream wedding there. As a result we got the most amazing photographs, and the guys even ensured the sun was shining for us :)

The staff on the day were so attentive, and worked extremely hard. The attention to detail was second to none, no stone was left unturned. The food was perfect, so delicious and the table service at mealtime was extremely attentive. One of the main things we had highlighted to the guys was that we wanted our guests to really enjoy themselves and to be really looked after, and the staff went above and beyond to achieve this. 

We have to give a special mention to Jens the events co-ordinator , as he was so much more that this. He was our right hand man, and couldn’t have done more for us. It was the little things of constantly helping me with my dress, to ensuring we got the best locations for the photos and constantly topping up our glass with champers!! He made us feel right at home, and made the entire experience so memorable for us, a true gent. 

Both myself and my husband Nev would like to thank Ian, Jens and all the team at Powerscourt Hotel for helping creating the perfect day for us. Everyone felt extremely welcome, the service was impeccable, superb venue and we wish we could do it all over again! 
",5,2017,10,17
217,"Superb Hotel Impeccable Service Location, Location","Our first stay at this hotel, upgraded to a full suite.  The hotel was quiet, not many guests, and the staff befriended us immediately.  They could not do enough to serve and offer help.  We stayed two nights and never wanted to leave.  Classic style throughout, subdued and traditional, we loved everything from the drinks on the lobby lounge, Guniess and wine in the Irish Pub Bar, walking the grounds and hanging out in the oversized room.  The marble bathroom with oversize walk-in shower was so luxurious, with TV's in the living room, bedroom and bathroom we could watch whatever we wanted wherever we were.  We will  be back!",5,2017,10,16
217,Certainly Not a 5* Hotel.,Due to Business & leisure I am a frequent visitor to good hotels & I’m afraid this visit fell well short of what I was expecting of a 5* hotel. I treated my family (7 0f us) 2 suites and one Room to a weekend away. Probably the most disappointing part was the very Poor service there was no meal that we didn’t have to either get up and look for someone or call out to a passing waiter for service and when we did order even snacks there was a long wait for food. We had to ring down for toiletries not once but twice missing from our room. A decorative swag on the window of my bedroom fell down I expected that this would be reported and rectified during the cleaning of the room but that lay in the same spot until we left that room on the last day (if room was hovered obviously hovered around it. Probably the most distressing thing for me was finding a sweet paper in the bed the first night I was left wondering if the bed was changed from last guest. When I reported this I got an explanation that didn’t reassure me so not a pleasant feeling using that bed again. Even though I enjoyed spending time with my family after a stressful time for me unfortunately the experience In this hotel was very unsatisfactory and even though it was never about the money I don’t think that just under 3K was very overpriced for this break.,3,2017,10,16
217,Gift for 80 Birthday,"The sitting room and bedroom, the beautiful bathroom, the large comfortable doublebeds, the TV, WIFI, Lights, View and the food in the Sika Restaurant and Sugar Loaf Lounge were magnificent. Very well trained staff, friendly service with housekeeping and service at the restaurant.",5,2017,10,14
217,All I can say is Wow.,"Had a couple of hours to kill and decided to try Powerscourt Hotel for a snack. All I ordered was the Smoked Salmon in the beautiful lounge. The presentation,  ambience and superb service was fantastic as well as the taste. I really want to try their main restaurant Sika next time.
Enjoyed every minute in the beautiful surroundings with amazing views.",5,2017,10,13
217,Nice but could be so much better,"Whilst I had a lovely time it was much more because we managed a couple of nights away without the kids. The hotel was nice but it didn't quite hit the mark expected for a 5 star hotel. There were a few things that disappointed:
- Service was poor. There wasn't enough attention to the guest and I found myself on multiple occasions having to go and ask someone to serve us.
- There were electrical works at the pool whilst we there. Whilst it was a Monday and probably the quietest time for the hotel to get the works done nobody advised us in advance that there were going to be works, We would have timed our visit to the ESPA at another time if we'd known in advance.
- The restaurant only offered a fixed 3 course menu. No a la carte. I'd have expected more choice for the guest.

On the plus side the room itself was very nice, comfortable and spacious, Very comfy bed and quiet hotel room meant that both myself and my wife got that badly needed uninterrupted sleep! Breakfast was good with an excellent range of options on offer. The hotel itself has spectacular views of the Sugar Loaf mountain and the grounds offer many scenic walks to clear the cobwebs and soak in the sights.  

All in all a pleasant stay but I did feel attention to detail and to the guest was lacking at times.",3,2017,10,13
217,Even better than we expected!,"We wanted to visit the famous Powerscourt Gardens, and what better way than to stay at the Powerscourt Hotel, which is on the estate, and within walking distance of the gardens.  

The young lady who checked us in was very friendly, and this positivity continued throughout our stay - which, unfortunately, was only for one night.

Our room was large and comfortable, the marble bathroom amazing (2 basins, bath, and shower and toilet in separate cubicles), and a nice sitting area. The only problem was that the TV was in a rather odd position and we weren't able to turn it to face the couch.

Our meal in the pub downstairs was good, as was the (included) breakfast.  Throughout, the staff members were unfailingly pleasant.  The hotel surrounds, too, are nice.

So, as you see, we enjoyed every aspect of our stay - and it's worth the stay even if you don't visit the gardens.  However, as the National Geographic has rated them the 3rd best in the world, you'd be mad if you didn't. The attractive village if Enniskerry is nearby, also, and is well worth a visit.

Highly recommended all round - and surprisingly reasonably priced.",5,2017,10,11
217,Breathtaking views !,"I stayed here for a couple of days.
On arriving we had to wait well over an hour for our room to be ready. On being given our keys to our room we were pleasantly surprised by the size of our suite . Very spacious and very upmarket just a shame some parts out quite shabby, curtains don’t pull properly, desk had chunks missing out of it, the floor had deep gouges clear to see.
Information was hidden in drawers, felt like I was a child rummaging through to find out about the Espa. Information wasn’t as informative as it could be. Ended up having to walk to the Espa to find out what we needed. 
Staff there weren’t the most helpful, didn’t show/explain to me how to operate the lockers. 
If you use the spa take slippers or flip flops with you, I ended up walking from the changing rooms to the pool bare foot. 
The jacuzzi wasn’t great, the jets weren’t that strong and didn’t touch my aching body, mould was located in the filters in the side of the jacuzzi. 
Some other areas were not of the standard of a 5 star hotel. Which is a shame. 
We ate one night in the bar downstairs , food was ok, furniture needs updating.
The hotel sits in beautiful grounds and the views are breathtaking . 
The hotel is huge, if you are spending one night here you will get lost, it takes a couple of days to find your way. More instructions for visitors are required. 
Enniskerry is a few minutes drive from here, a few quaint gift shops, one restaurant (Emilia’s Italian), a couple of daytime eateries. Worth a visit. 

Definitely recommend visiting the powerscourt waterfall which is 5km away . 
Would I return to this hotel? Yes

",4,2017,10,10
217,Our 2nd Visit to this World Class Hotel,"The Powerscourt Hotel is one of the grandest hotels in the world.  We first stayed there in 2014 on our first trip to Ireland, and were delighted to spend three lovely nights there again this Spring.  The hotel bespeaks elegance and comfort in every respect.  The rooms are huge (ours was approximately 600 square feet); the amenities include separate dressing areas, separate bath and walk in shower, the largest, most comfortable beds of any hotel we have ever stayed in.  Wonderful restaurants and a breakfast buffet beyond description!",5,2017,10,10
217,Another fab stay,"We stayed here on the August bank holiday to celebrate our 10th Wedding anniversary. We were upgraded to an amazing suite with lovely views of the Sugar Loaf mountain.  We had lovely cocktails in the Sugarloaf bar & the staff there were as always so nice & friendly. We availed of the Hotel Car to go down to the town & on the way back Robert (Robbie) collected us & another family.  Robbie was so friendly & chatty & extremely helpful.  He was also on the front desk when we were checking out & made an effort to come over to us to see how we enjoyed our night.  We ordered breakfast in our room the next day & it was delicious.  We also spent time in the pool area which is lovely & relaxing.
I think this was our 4th of 5th stay & it wont be our last.",5,2017,10,09
217,inexperienced waiting staff,"Dinner in the restaurant and asked a waitress what 1 of the items on the plate was ""I don't know but it looks posh"" was the response !! on a few occasions water we requested never arrived. Steaks not cooked very well. Drinks are exceptionally expensive",4,2017,10,08
217,Excellent 5 Star Hotel,"Powerscourt Hotel lives up to its reputation and 5-star status every time!  I have stayed here several times and have never been disappointed.  The hotel is lovely but relaxed, the food is excellent, the service is superb, and the views are glorious.",5,2017,10,04
217,Beautiful Landscape,"A recent visit to this hotel was very interesting. On one hand the staff were very accommodating (front desk, concierge, and pub) and at another time totally indifferent (Sugar Loaf lounge). The grounds are spectacular, there is an awesome golf course and it is only 30-35 minutes from the airport even during rush hour.",4,2017,10,03
217,Mid week getaway,We booked a last minute overnight stay in Powerscourt. I've wanted to stay here for a few years and it certainly didn't disappoint. We stayed in their basic room with a courtyard view. It was felt luxurious and the size of the room was one of the biggest I've ever stayed in. The bathroom I would love to have in my own home. The dressing room is also a great touch. The morning breakfast was delicious and I think even the most fussiest of eaters would easily be satisfied with. We had had a few drinks in the sugar loaf the day we checked in. I enjoyed their cocktails. The staff hotel wide were delightful. I definitely would like to stay again in the future. ,5,2017,10,02
217,Excellent,"Excellent staff and superb restaurant/room service team. Every time we stay here, it's consistently good. Would recommend calling their reservations team rather than making online bookings if you are looking for their balcony suites.  If travelling with children, do check their pool times as they have curtailed the hours that children are welcome in the pool.",5,2017,09,29
217,Really good hotel,"This hotel was massive, set in lovely grounds 
I found staff helpful and pleasant.
My room (352) was clean and tidy.
Loads of storage space 

My only criticism was my shower, I like a powerful shower but this one was like standing under a leaky tap, no pressure there at all but the handheld one in the same shower cubicle worked a treat but who wants to be holding a shower attachment when showering

I would definitely return to this hotel",4,2017,09,29
217,amazing hotel,"even if there are a few things that we didnt  like(how the bathroom was cleaned) .. the hotel,staff and food was amazing...
even if we staied just 3 days  we sow so many beautiful places... 
the comfort of the room was at the highest level...
we will like to visit this hotel again and again...",5,2017,09,27
217,Fabulous spa treatments,"I visited the spa at Powerscourt Hotel with friends on a Sunday afternoon.  The package included a bento lunch, which was delicious and very filling, followed by a swim and relaxation before an 80 minute 'total immersion' treatment. It included a full body massage and facial. It was fabulously relaxing and my skin has felt amazing all week since the treatment.  Wow. The hotel is lovely, with an American feel. Spacious areas and very attentive staff. I have stayed here before as a hotel guest. Do stay here, you'll love it. ",5,2017,09,22
217,Great Hotel,"It was luxury without being too fussy. I booked a pregnancy spa treatment for my wife, the hotel then thoughtfully provided a pregnancy pillow for our room, fantastic attention to detail. Beautiful surroundings, great Spa, pool and golf course. ",5,2017,09,20
217,Awesome hotel with a couple of minor problems,"Absolutely loved this hotel. It's in a beautiful location, and the hotel itself is beautiful. Overall, the services was also excellent. We were upgraded for free to a lovely suite, room 546. The bathroom had a soaking tub, shower and a toilet area with a door. There was also a changing room with two large closets and drawer space for all of our stuff. The room came with a nice, powerful hair dryer which was helpful. 

This hotel would have received 5 stars if not for two issues. First, the room cleaning was inconsistent, and on the first day, it was downright awful. That first night they made our beds, and replaced our towels, but nothing else. Our floor wasn't swept nor were surfaces wiped down. We could tell this because the remnants of the breakfast we ate were not cleaned up when we returned to our room that evening. They also did not replace our dirty, used coffee cups nor did they replenish our coffee and creamers. We left a note the next day and after that, the room was properly cleaned. 

Also at issue, and probably the more significant issue, was the state of the shower. While the marble bathroom was beautiful, it is obvious that the shower is not properly cleaned on a regular basis. There was A LOT of mold in the grout at the base of the shower (I've posted pictures), particularly under the built-in, corner, marble shelf. It really is a shame as everything else about the room was delightful. I know that mold can be a problematic issue, but it's obvious that they are not cleaning properly in the corners of the shower on a regular basis. They really need to pull up the grout/caulk at the bottom of the shower and replace it. So, better housekeeping, and better overall maintenance of the bathroom would give this lovely hotel a perfect rating from me. I would definitely stay here again, and I would recommend it to others as well.",4,2017,09,17
217,Exceptional interior,"I have to give this hotel 5 stars as our family was treated very well.  I am not sure why but we were upgraded to two suites.  We have traveled to 50 countries, and the quality of everything inside the suites were the best we have ever seen.  The carpet, the furniture, the bathrooms, the fixtures, the linens, everything were of the highest quality.  The design included the most amazing level of details and the craftsmanship extremely high.  If there were any faults to pick, it would be the grounds are not consistent with the hotel’s building and interior.  While there is nothing wrong with a big lawn, there was not much to look at.  Considering the millions (hundreds of?) spent on the building and interior, a tiny fraction of the building investments could have gone into the grounds and made the whole resort spectacular.  We read many mediocre reviews of the hotel’s service level after it became a Marriott.  We received very fine service over the 2 days we were there. ",5,2017,09,16
217,"Nice, but a bit sterile and overpriced","The rooms at the Powerscourt were phenomenally large and beautifully appointed as were the lobby. However, the resort as whole lacked character and felt oddly ""forced"". Besides the view of the forest out front, the atmosphere was very stale and not much to do on premises for such a stately location. The Powerscourt Gardens, Golf course, and waterfall nearby were just as accessible and available as if we stayed in Enniskerry ( a mere 1/4 mile away from the front gates) In addition, the restaurant and particularly the bar food, was very expensive and forced. Kudos to the Irish breakfast and buffet, which was outstanding. Bottom line: OK place, but not worth the expense.",3,2017,09,16
217,Overnight stop,This is a most impressive hotel set within the magnificent setting of the Powerscourt estate.The bedroom facilities were of the highest quality.The lobby area and restaurant were well presented and a great variety was available at breakfast.The food in the hotel's pub was however just average.The gardens were beautifully maintained.,5,2017,09,16
217,Luxury and scenery,"I love this hotel and have stayed there many times. The food is amazing, the location is amazing and the staff are great. It's ideally located in Powerscourt House estate with fabulous walks and fresh air. The hotel provides bicycles to cycle around the estate on and it's a short drive to Ireland's highest waterfall. I saw locations for a couple of movies and saw a few camera crews on some of my visits there. Legal Eagles, Excalibur, PS I Love You, Valentine's Day, Brave Heart, Vikings and Penny Dreadful amongst many others were filmed in the area.
The spa pool is very beautiful and unusual.
Enniskerry village down the road is a lovely little place and the hotel is just a fifteen minute drive from Ireland's biggest shopping centre which is hard to believe given the fact that this location is fabulously rural.",5,2017,09,14
217,Fine Hotel in scenic Country Setting,"Got off to a bad start when my luggage was mislaid, after that all was good. Good food, lunch, dinner & breakfast. Service was ok but not excellent. Bedroom of a high standard with luxury bathroom, leisure facilities were excellent. Really enjoyed the short stay in this beautiful hotel",4,2017,09,13
217,"Wonderful location, outstanding service and GREAT vacation","We visited Powerscourt recently and loved it AGAIN!  I had stayed at Powerscourt with my sisters and then again with friends, but this time with my family.  It proved to be everything I told them the stay would  be.  Our rooms were gorgeous, the breakfast absolutely the best we had on our 2 week visit through Ireland and the service outstanding.  We had our son with his family that consisted of a 9 month son.  We needed to get into Dublin for an overnight before we headed home.  Robbie, the concierge, was great.  He managed to get us a taxi for 7 people (hard to find) then he made an immediate trip to his house to get us his infant car seat we needed for the taxi.  He was fantastic! 
We all hope to go back to Powerscourt since it is the perfect spot with perfect amenities and the perfect staff!",5,2017,09,13
217,Quite possibly the best hotel we have ever visited!,"Where do we start?  This is a fantastic property in all regards.  Staff, facilities, grounds, pool/spa and sauna, pub.   The attention to detail here was outstanding.  It is posh without being presumptuous.  

We recently completed a 9-night driving tour of Ireland and stayed in a different hotel each night.  Powerscourt was our 1st night after our overnight flight from LA.  It was a fairly easy drive from the airport via the M-10 toll road and has plenty of free parking available.

The room and especially the bed were very comfortable and gave us a much-needed night of rest and relaxation.

The fact that this is a Marriott property was an added bonus for us.

If you stay here, make sure you plan time to visit the gardens right down the road too.",5,2017,09,12
217,Outstanding Comfort and Service,"While this hotel is quite generic and not particularly Irish in feel, it is of the very highest quality with it’s enormous and luxurious rooms. Great place to stay if you’re bypassing Dublin and renting a car to tour Ireland or if you want to visit Powerscourt House Gardens.  There was a minor issue with a light switch when we arrived, and within moments, an electrician was in our room. I have never seen this level of attentive service. 
It does look like the main purpose of the Powerscourt is to hold weddings and other large events, but when we were there in early September we saw no sign of that, and it was very quiet and serene.",5,2017,09,11
217,Mini-moon return:,"We returned here for our mini-moon, having had our wedding reception here last year. It had been over a year since we were last in the hotel but upon return we remembered why we loved the place so much. 

The beautiful weather helped, but the initial relax and refresh in the amazing spa kick started a wonderful visit here. It was a seamless transition to the spa, which couldn't be said of other dedicated spa hotels. Our room wasn't ready upon arrival but we could leave our bags, go down to the spa and start to enjoy the weekend straight away which was great. 

The spa is out of this world and definitely worth a visit. 

We really enjoyed our meals in the hotel, in Sika (for dinner and breakfast) and the Sugar Loaf Lounge for lunch. 

Would highly recommend this hotel for a visit. Looking forward to our next visit.",5,2017,09,11
217,VIP treatment,"I spent a one night stay in this fabulous hotel with a friend of mine having booked the ''Exquisite ESPA'' package comprising of afternoon tea for two, a 50 minute spa treatment each in addition to overnight stay for two with breakfast. Below are some observations on this wonderful Hotel.

Customer Service and Accommodation: The treatment provided to us within the hotel was exceptional. We arrived early(prior to the specified check in time) and were told that no standard double rooms were available and therefore we would be ungraded to a suite. What a wonderful gesture! The room was absolutely beautiful with a large sitting room, bedroom,dressing room and bathroom with a large bath, shower room and separate toilet. Touch pads were located around the rooms allowing you to easily adjust the lights and air conditioning. The double beds were exceptionally comfortable (perhaps the most comfortable night's sleep I've ever had!)

The Spa: Once again ..the spa was beautiful. The dim lighting in the pool area creates the most tranquil atmosphere. In addition the relaxation area and women's thermal suite are beautiful. I will say that the jacuzzis in both areas could be slightly warmer but we still enjoyed our time in them. The full body massage I had was wonderful and the sorbet provided afterwards was a lovely touch (something I have never received at any other spa).

Afternoon Tea: Having never had afternoon tea before we were unsure what to expect. Overall the sandwiches were slightly unusual and I probably would have preferred a more basic selection (although I may be in the minority there). The scones and desserts were delicious. However, we did experience some difficulties in settling the bill as the staff seemed not to be aware of the ''Exquisitely ESPA'' package and had therefore charged us for the afternoon tea separately. After we explained about the package our bill ended up being passed from one waiter to another until eventually they managed to provide us with the correct bill for the additional drinks we had purchased.

The Reception staff and Doorman:The staff encountered at reception on both check-in and check-out were phenomenal! Unfortunately I didn't catch their names. On check-out I asked the door man if it would be possible to call us a taxi to take us down the road to Enniskerry as it had started raining. He then spoke to his colleague who used the Hotel's car to drive us to the bus stop free of charge. I have never experienced service like this in any other hotel. 

I am already looking forward to many future stays in this beautiful Hotel.",5,2017,09,10
217,Beautiful hotel and wonderful staff,"I can't say enough about this hotel.  About a half hour from Dublin airport.  A beautiful hotel.  The staff can not do enough for you.  We got in a day late because of American Airlines and they made up for it.
We had a lovely suite that was just beautiful.  They have two golf courses, which my husband played both of them.
There is also a spa there that is really nice.  They open it up to the kids for a bit and then it's just adults.  So quiet and peaceful.
They have a very nice restaurant and also a large lobby where they serve food.  
We really enjoyed our stay there.  The staff was helpful, friendly and efficient.",5,2017,09,07
217,Average,"Stayed for 4 nights as part of a business trip. Quick easy checkin. Upgraded to suite good start. Bed reasonably comfortable, pillows offered no support at all.
Room not cleaned for two days, not impressed. 
Sugar loaf lounge and McGills drinks prices are a rip-off.
Sikh restaurant is excellent in particular Cedric.

An excellent location and spectacular grounds.",3,2017,09,07
217,Nice hotel even if the waiting staff were a bit iffy at first,"Decided to have afternoon tea here after visiting the waterfall nearby. The hotel is well appointed with welcoming open spaces. The doorman was welcoming and friendly. The waiting staff in the lounge were a little different in their style. When we asked for afternoon tea we got the distinct impression that this was not a welcome request as it required a lot of preparation and we were told we would have to wait for 30 min - ""they didn't usually serve afternoon tea to drop-in's"" . The waitress informed us that we really should have booked a day in advance and she would have to check first to see if we could be accommodated (I have stayed in many hotels around the world but this need to book afternoon tea in advance is new to me! I would expect any hotel worthy of the name to be able to present an afternoon test without a fuss)
As it happened we were served immediately - no 30 min wait. 
Food was excellent and tea selection was good. I would score higher but I felt that the lounge staff should have handled the situation better and with less fuss. An item is either available or not. And a guest is a guest whether they are a resident or a ""drop-in""",3,2017,09,07
217,Outstanding,"We stayed 2 nights, the hotel is excellent. 
Staff is nice, the room and bed were very comfortable. The area is very peaceful and
the hotel environment are very good. Breakfast was very good.  I highly recommend this hotel.",5,2017,09,05
217,Excellent place to stay,"The location of the hotel is great. Located almost in the middle of nowhere. Very quiet and relaxing. 

Very friendly staff who puts the customer first. Located right next to Powerscourt Estate, it's an easy walk. Very nice rooms. I recommend spending the money and getting the mountain view rooms.

Would recommend the falconry experience offered by Powerscourt.",5,2017,09,04
217,Lovely stay as always with 2 minor points,"My husband and I stayed for a night to celebrate our wedding anniversary. It is always a real treat to stay here and you feel relaxed the minute you check in. We also received a lovely card in our room and a free dessert with anniversary message which were nice touches.

We had a delicious meal at the Sika restaurant and we just noted two small things that I feel could be improved: we ordered a latte and cappuccino with our desserts but the coffee was not nice at all and we both just had one sip and left it -it tasted like it came from an instant machine. Also the waiters hold the bottle of wine away from the table and our wine glasses were left empty a few times (we realised just before we left that there was wine left in the bottle and I had been sitting with an empty glass for some time). Although, the restaurant did seem busy that evening so this may be the reason for this one.

Overall we had a very nice stay and look forward to our next visit!",4,2017,09,03
217,elegant,"

A most luxurious hotel in the public area and in the rooms. We paid for the cheapest room ... quiet and clean and efficient. 
In particular, the entrance and exit from the bath in the room in which we slept is very difficult and unsafe due to the distance that is impossible to pass or climb in one step. In any case, people of average height (1.75 meters).
Breakfast is very good but expensive. 
We ate dinner at the restaurant and I would like to praise their consideration and moderation in my situation. I arrived  sick to the restaurant and although the price was fixed in advance, I paid a quarter of it because I ate about a quarter of a meal.
 If you can afford it, the hotel is highly recommended for nature tours in the Dublin area. ",5,2017,09,03
217,"Grand, nice contemporary","This is a huge complex of contemporary design but with a classic architectural inspiration.
Great Spa, 2 restaurants plus a pub and very ample public areas provide a comfortable experience.
We had a mountain view suite of generous over average size with a compartmented marble bathroom plus a toilet. 3 TV sets, authomatic curtains and electronic monitor room control.
Breakfast buffet is good, food at SIKA restaurant is not up to the price. Other dining options are 5 minute drive away in little village.
Staff very kind, WIFI throughout with very good speed. 
Excellent location for visiting Powerhouse gardens and sorrounding area with great homes.

217,Much improved,Had to upgrade my last review about unfriendly pool staff. Following a discussion with the management the atmosphere has definitely become much more friendly and warm especially towards families at the pool and facilities. I commend the team for addressing my complaint and making visits much more enjoyable. ,5,2017,08,28
217,A perfect night away,"Booked a night at powerscourt with my husband last minute after our original weekend plans were cancelled. Had a really lovely time. Hadn't been since 2012 when it was previously a ritz Carlton and it was every bit as good, probably even better than before now it's a Marriott! Booked a suite which did not disappoint. Slept like a baby in an extremely comfortable bed and the hotel is so so quiet! The pool is a beautiful place to relax with dimmed lighting. However, it can be overrun by kids at times. The gym is really good -large with modern equipment and is quiet basically all the time-you'll never have to wait on a machine! The food in the sika restaurant was to die for-see my other review! Breakfast was great too. Service and staff fantastic. Loads of nice walks to do around the beautiful countryside.Will definitely be back!",4,2017,08,27
217,Breathtaking Hotel,"My wife and I recently stayed at this hotel for 2 nights.

The rooms are really nicely appointed, nicest room my wife and I have ever stayed in.  

Veiws are outstanding - short walk to Powerscourt Castle and gardens which were breathtaking.  

Food was great and pricing for this level of luxury on everything was extremely reasonable.

Would highly recomend! ",5,2017,08,26
217,Great way to end a trip to Ireland,I stayed here with my husband our our last night in Ireland and it was beautiful.  There were three different dining options on site so we didn't have to drive anywhere and the service was great.  There is also a golf course on the property as well as a garden that you can walk through.  Our room was amazing and the staff were very friendly and helpful.  It was only about a 40 minute drive from the hotel to Dublin airport which was critical for us as we had an earlier flight.  I highly recommend this hotel to anyone on their honeymoon or looking to celebrate a special occasion.  I don't think you can be disappointed.,5,2017,08,26
217,Spacious luxurious rooms ,"The bedrooms are amazing. So spacious and tastefully decorated. The walk-in wardrobe room was bigger than some hotel rooms we have stayed. The real luxury though is the bathroom. The large marble surround bath, twin sinks and of course not forgetting the tv in the mirror! The thoughtful separation of shower and toilet into adjoining private cubicles ensures all facilities can be utilised.  Superbly comfortable bed with a bedside touch panel to control lights ensures a great nights sleep. As it was a special treat the birthday card and chocolates were a lovely surprise. Kids can use the pool 9-11 and 4-6. I can't wait to return and enjoy some ESPA treatments. So close to Dublin yet so utterly peaceful and tranquil. ",5,2017,08,24
217,Fantastic and Relaxing,"It was a great experience and we thoroughly enjoyed it.  We stayed for 2 nights and enjoyed every minute of it.  The rooms are huge and bathrooms are very well equipped and one of the best bathrooms I have seen in a hotel in along while.  It was busy but all of the staff were amazing and we had a great time.

Powerscourt Gardens are only a short walk from the hotel and worth a visit.  The bar was very busy but the staff were very attentive and we didn't have to wait long to get a drink.",4,2017,08,23
217,Potential 5 star,"Beautiful hotel and location. Staff is very friendly and helpful.  There are a few things that keep it from being 5 star in my mind. The rooms are huge and bathrooms are nice, but not cleaned properly. There was a great deal of mold & mildew on the grout throughout the shower. In addition, the hardwood floors are beautiful, but have been damaged extensively from the moving of furniture. For me, it was very sad to see this.  Breakfast was good, but there were too many people on the weekends so it was very hectic. If interested in visiting and you want it calm and quiet, go during the week and on the off or shoulder season. We were here in August when many weddings occur and lots of families.  Very nice fitness room, but again needs some basic maintenance for cleanliness and finishing repairs. This hotel has great potential and is a beautiful property. ",4,2017,08,21
217,BEAUTIFUL HOTEL WALKING DISTANCE FROM POWERSCOURT GARDENS,"My husband & I stayed at this lovely hotel while traveling with a group.  Our stay was for 3 nights.  It is close to a very small town of Ennikerry.  The accommodations were great - a very comfortable bed.  But by far the best part of the room was the bathroom.  All marble with a tub & marble shower, tub, & marble toilet room.  We have stayed in some amazing hotels in Europe before, the all time best being St. Regis in Florence Italy, but this hotel had the best bathroom ever - more particularly the best shower ever - rain and hand shower but with lots of water pressure.  That's a rare thing at a hotel!  Our room was not on the mountain side, so there was not much of a view out the window, but as soon as you go outside, it is beauty from every direction.  And the Powerscourt Gardens are not to be missed - just a short walk from the hotel.  Breakfast buffet features just about anything you would want.  We had dinner at the hotel one night & it was superb!  Went to have a drink in the pub & the service was very slow.  Conference facilities & food were good.  My husband golfed across the street on the west course & I rode in the cart.  A very memorable & beautiful experience all around!",5,2017,08,21
217,pure luxury,I stayed here on Saturday night 19th August with my sister  her 2 daughters and my daughter it was fabulous.hotel is spotlessy clean staff are lovely and helpful food was lovely at breakfast and plenty of it beds so comfy would high recommend and would def return ,5,2017,08,20
217,Nice hotel but shocking level of service from staff,"First off the few pros:
Nice hotel and nice grounds in a lovely location. 

Unfortunately there are a fair few negatives mainly around the staff:

1:on checking in at 1300 (early check in is standard for Marriott members of our status) we were told our room wasn't ready but it would be ready in 20mins or so. 1400 came along and no sign so we went and asked at reception was our room ready but were told that it wouldn't be ready until 1600 and we were made to feel stupid by the receptionist for being confused by this. When we complained to the other receptionist, we got given a room straight away. A bad start to our relaxing post wedding weekend.

2. At no point did a member of staff try to help us with our bags, in a 5 star hotel I would consider this a minimum. We ended up lugging our own bags everywhere.

3. After checking in we decided to have a drink in the reception lobby area and ""watch the world go by"". My wife found a member of staff and asked for 2 coffees, only to be screamed at and told ""no we're too busy, we're not serving anymore"". She offered to serve us if we relocated to a table 30 yards away but this table was in a dark corner, beside where they were cleaning dishes and banging cutlery and not what we wanted at all. We then spotted others around us with drinks. So I'm still confused as to what was wrong   with the table that we were at. 

4. We found hair in the bath and no one had shown us around the room so finding the air con inside the bedside locker took a ridiculously long time. It also took us a while to find the light switch for the same reason.

5. Finally a more minor point, the next morning, we had booked spa treatment for 1200 and we were not seen until 1225. We had to watch people who arrived after us go in ahead of us. At any other time, we wouldn't have minded but after all the struggles of the previous day we were a bit fed up with bad service.

The staff are generally unfriendly and have an attitude. Their first instinct is to say ""no"". The only smile we got from a member of staff was from a cleaner in the corridor once.
 I stay in a lot of hotels through business travel and to be honest a 3 star hotel would be embarrassed by the lack of warmth from the staff. Powerscourt is a five star apparently but the staff aren't.

I have to think that there is a lack of training in customer service throughout the employees as the attitude was prevalent amongst all.

For a third of the price, you could stay in a much nicer, friendlier environment in one of the many lovely b&bs in the area.

Would not recommend .

217,Perfect Place,"Spent 3 great days and nights.  1 Bedroom suite was magnificent.  Good location for visiting all things south of Dublin.  The Sika Restaurant was good and the pub is convenient, although can get crowded.",5,2017,08,19
217,Cousin's Wedding ,"Wow. Absolutely amazing setting and grounds. Beautiful meal with melt in your mouth fillet of beef. Great selection of things to choose from for breakfast. Very large spotless bedrooms and huge bathrooms. We loved the swimming pool, Jacuzzi etc. We can't wait for our next visit.",5,2017,08,19
217,Family group - disaster,"For my parents 40th wedding anniversary they took 7 of us mid week for 2 nights with 13 of us on the 2nd night. Dinner on the first night was upstairs in the lounge as the bar was full which was fine but the service was just awful it took hours to feed the 7 of us and trying to get water or any other drink was just impossible it was so disappointing and my parents were mortified because they had taken us all here and it was nothing but issues. On the 2nd day at breakfast there was wire in my mushroom so I brought it to the managers attention so he could remove the tray. I then agreed with this manager that we could pre-order our dinner for that evening for 13 of us because we were worried we would have the same timing issues again. He said no problem he would leave menus in my room with sheet to tick boxes for orders. Also at breakfast we were not brought or offered toast, there was a 10 minute wait for glasses at the buffet, and a further 10 minute wait for the orange juice to come out.

So after breakfast we went touring until about 2pm. Came back and our room had been cleaned. The staff didn't give us mugs for our tea and coffee and gave us just 1 towel between the 2 of us. They also threw out the tops for my own shampoo & conditioner bottles which I always use for my travel so I couldn't take them with me again. And then, the menus were not in the room as promised. So after numerous phone calls re the mugs, then the towels as we discovered each thing one by one, then the menus, we went for lunch. Then we got the menus for dinner for the Sika restaurant. I tracked down all my family's orders and as instructed emailed them to the Sika restaurant asking them to acknowledge receipt of email. Went for a quick swim because we had to go back to the room to check did Sika reply which they didn't, so on the phone again and another 10 mins later they confirmed receipt over the phone. Meanwhile, my mother was just worried all day about the service and if the dinner that night would be the same disaster as the previous night. Dinner was perfect, staff very attentive. Unfortunately it just doesn't make up for everything that happened and bring on the phone all day.

I spoke to staff relations manager on checkout with my feedback and she could not offer my mother any discount on the bill - like this was a few thousand euro spent in the hotel over the 2 nights as she was paying for everyone, so she paid 5 star prices but did not get 5 star service. I was offered 20% off my next booking instead - sure none of the family could ever go there again after what went on it was just such a disaster - staff everywhere and just no organisation. Everything was always ""on its way"", water was on its way, mains were on their way, drinks were on their way, everything was on its way somewhere and nothing went anywhere.

Setting is amazing, check out Victors Way sculpture park for something different...",1,2017,08,18
217,Lovely Location but very poor service,"I came here to stay here with my mum for one night. There was a lot that was very nice about the hotel but the staffing situation badly let this 5 star hotel down.

Pros - Lovely location, spacious room, amazing view, huge bathroom, very very comfortable beds. Very helpful staff on check in. Great Balcony, lovely outdoor patio with great view for breakfast. Nice spa.

We were shown to our room but no one explained the facilities of the room to us.  Air con was turned on, but I couldn't turn it off and it was very cold, my mum is in her 80's and started to feel really cold. I called to reception and someone did come within 5 minutes. The air con is operated from a touch panel in drawer next to the bed. He asked if anyone had shown us how to operate the touch pad or shown us where everything was situated in the room and I said no. He turned on tv and it was stuck on tv channels only and he couldn't change it. He left and within 5 minutes called back to say the system was broken and he would turn it off from Master control and if we wanted heat we would have to ring to get it turned on, not very satisfactory,  he then called back to say it was fixed and we could operate it now from our touch panel.  This worked for a while and then stopped working again.  The door to the balcony was broken and hard to open.

Breakfast was where the staffing problems came to light. We were shown to our table on the patio and no one came near  us for 15 minutes to take our tea & coffee order. Eventually I walked from table to find someone, coffee and tea arrived but no milk we were told it would be brought never arrived,  asked someone else, eventually I took a jug from another table. The buffet was depilated by the time we arrived, hardly any eggs left and they were cold, the bacon was rock hard. When you pay 5 star prices you expected 5 star, I feel the breakfast in general was not great. Eggs should be cooked to order and there should be staff to help. My mum wanted more tea and again I had to go and find someone to order it from.",3,2017,08,18
217,Absolutely fabulous ,"Have just spent a wonderful stay to celebrate my ""big birthday ""
Dropped my wife off to greeted by 2 valets who brought in our bags, and offered to park our car. I declined by as car park was convenient.
By the time I got to reception bags already gone to room.
Speedy eh!
It's only on some occasions you enter your room via a hallway opening into a very comfortable living area.
Bedroom area equally nice with adjacent very large bathroom with separate toilet and walk in shower( which was great.
Bed very comfy with more than ample cupboard space .
Well equipped minibar and 3 TV's ( one in the bathroom)
Had dinner in Sitka .
No complaints at all. Service was prompt, courteous . Bóta starters and mains were delicious. Deserts to die for.
Same rooms used for breakfast which was buffet style with option of cooked to order. All hot items were great and a very wide selection of cold cuts, cheeses , fruits. breads etc .....
While we didn't eat in Sugar Loaf lounge or McGills Pub did notice some lovely food passing by us.
Great Spa and large pool available for guests.
The grounds surrounding Powerscourt are amazing not to be missed weather permitting.
This is a perfect spot to explore the Wicklow area and the delightful villages dotted nearby.
We didn't pass one member of staff who didn't offer a kind word throughout our short which was too short by far.
It only means one thing and that's a definite return , Soon !!!!!!",5,2017,08,17
217,Beautiful building but weak service,"Had a one night stay in a suite with my husband. Highlights were the room which was immaculate and decorated to a very high standard. Also breakfast at ground level (not main breakfast area which is a scrum fest) on Sunday morning was exceptional with very nice food options and extra flourishes in a beautiful setting. And relaxation room in spa is exceptional.
Low points are the cheesy ""Irish Pub"" downstairs (which is like an Irish Pub you'd see in an airport) with very slow service. 
We ate in the main restaurant that night and while the food was good there were two major service mistakes- my husband was brought the wrong starter and then they mistakenly added two premium brandies costing nearly €50 ordered by a neighbouring table to our bill! Not good enough! Also, at this price point a potato and veg side should come as standard with a main dish.
Worst point was being strongly discouraged from having a drink in the main bar after dinner and being pointed to the Irish Pub because (as one staff member clarified) they wanted to get the main bar ""hoovered and set up for breakfast"". This was at 10:55pm!
Also I don't understand the ""optional turndown service"" when its a 5 star hotel. They tell you to ring a number if you want turndown but it's not clear if that's because it costs extra. At this price point, turndown should be standard even though I realise some people think it's silly.
Generally a surprising level of attitude in many of the staff. This should be addressed with training",3,2017,08,17
217,Del boy manoeuvres,"I booked a ""Courtyard view"" room through booking.com which shows a photo with a terrace and in the description it says the room comes with a terrace or balcony (see attached), but the actual room assigned doesn't have a terrace or balcony. Completely misleading!! Apparently you are meant to request it, who on earth would know that! when I checked in the staff said they have a beautiful ""garden view"" room but there's no garden view room on their website. See for yourself in the attached pic what a courtyard or garden view looks like. They really pulled one over me. The whole point of our stay was so that my wife could sit outside and draw. If it is booking.com's fault, the hotel still has responsibility for who they let manage reservations on their behalf. I am so disappointed and feel cheated and this has tarnished our first visit to Ireland.",1,2017,08,16
217,Fabulous trip from start to finish!!,"If you want something wow then this is the place to go to. I have visited this hotel twice and I would most certainly return again and again and again!! 
You would never get tired of visiting the hotel, the gardens or Enniskerry as it's a very quaint town with plenty to do and see. 
Can't wait to return in the nearer future. ",5,2017,08,16
217,Lunch ,"We had lunch last Sunday at the sika restaurant - the food was excellent . We had soup to start , the burger, steak and chicken chicken main courses were lovely . 
The desserts were rather limited which was a shame . 
The staff were lovely but the restaurant was empty ( no other customers on a Sunday - extraordinary ) so there was no atmosphere at all . Shame  as lovely spot . ",4,2017,08,16
217,One of the nicest I have been to,"We had a room with a balcony overlooking the fountain.  It was a really nice place with high end finishes and extremely large given you are in Europe.  The TV built into the bathroom mirror is ok but a bit overkill. The walk in closet\changing area is really large and held our luggage fine, all of the hotel amenities are really nice, I found the pool area to be a bit dark for my liking but I guess it was more Spa like than a play in pool.

Breakfast was made to order as well as Buffet we ordered individual meals then went up for some fruit and our own juices, the staff in the breakfast area were very attentive and accommodating.

I don't think you can be disappointed with a place like this unless you had particularly bad service or something which we certainly had no issues at all.

It is a bit secluded but I gather that is by design the grounds are immaculate the Marriott Company should be proud to have this in their list of properties!",5,2017,08,15
217,Luxurious,"From the moment we arrived we knew we would love Powerscourt. And it did not disappoint. Beautiful grounds, fabulous restaurant, and an exquisite room with every imaginable luxury. We felt pampered, special.",5,2017,08,15
217,Great Quiet Resort,"An excellent resort located in the quiet Wicklow Mountains. The hotel was beautiful and our room was fantastic. The hotel is within walking distance to the Powerscourt Gardens, but unfortunately not within walking distance to the Waterfall. The pool is the nicest pool that I have ever been too and I could have relaxed there all day. I would recommend this hotel to someone who's looking for a couple quiet days after exploring Dublin.",5,2017,08,14
217,Visited the gardens,"We only had the chance to visit the gardens and have a delicious cup of coffee. We had a wonderful experience. The only problem was that there seemed to be a few people confused in the cafeteria as far as where to conduct ordering and paying. It was very busy, so maybe this is the reason. ",5,2017,08,14
217,Spacious and quiet,"Room: Mountain view suite with balcony access. 

Suite includes:
Two bathrooms (Master suite includes separate shower and bath), walk-in closet with loads of space, very comfortable bed, touch controls for drapes, lighting, etc. 

Two flat screen televisions provide entertainment in English, German, French, Russian, Arabic, Chinese to name a few. 

Fitness Centre, located downstairs next to ESPA, is very well equipped with two sets of free weights, four treadmills, four stationary bicycles, one recumbent bicycle, five elliptical trainers and a separate studio. 

Staff are FANTASTIC!! Everything one could ask for and, above all, very peaceful!

The only downside was the individual who was compelled to smoke on the 6th floor...of a NON-SMOKING property. Some idiots just don't get it or have zero consideration for others!",5,2017,08,13
217,"Great hotel, but kind of expected more for the price","I came here as part of my 30th birthday, and we paid for the deluxe room. When you walk in, it is somewhere that is somewhere that is new, trying to look old. We paid for the deluxe room and it was a beautiful room but our room overlooked the car park. For nearly 400e a night, not exactly a beautiful view!

We went to the main restaurant, and doesn't hit the fine dining element that they are aiming for and it was absolutely roasting! For the breakfast, it was self service breakfast and to be honest given the calibre and price of the hotel, I would expect a breakfast cooked to order. I don't think I would go back again.",3,2017,08,12
217,Beautiful Hotel,"We first stayed in Powerscourt for our wedding anniversary in 2015 it was so amazing, we decided to return for joint birthday celebration in 2017. The meal in Sika restaurant on our first trip was one of the best meals we ever had but unfortunately it didn't live up to our expectations the second time. The couple at table next to us had their cat on a lead, which wasn't ideal when eating. On both trips the rooms were exceptional. The spa was very good on both occasions. We also loved McGills bar...the best part was the entertainment, two amazingly talented musicians.  One frustrating thing was that we had to ring the hotel, restaurant and spa numerous times before we got an answer. The sugar loaf lounge also closes early on week days so no quiet night cap unless you wanted to go downstairs to the pub. Service in general wasn't as good on second trip either. ",4,2017,08,09
217,Birthday visit ,Recently visited this hotel for birthday treat . It was an amazing experience. From the wonderful tasty delightful afternoon tea to a great dinner in Sika restaurant.😃The room was just great and I especially liked the tv in the bathroom mirror!! Bed was huge an extremely comfortable. The pool is so relaxing with its dark tiles and great changing facilities. Staff were excellent and welcoming. Spent nearly 2 hours on the chess board. ,5,2017,08,08
217,Powerscourt,"The setting is beautiful and there are things to do nearby if you get there early enough. The gardens next door close at 5:30 but are supposedly a must see.
We were upgraded to a very nice suite that had a kitchenette, living/dining area, a spa like bathroom and a large patio with a beautiful view of the mountains. The room was perfect. Unfortunately, we were only there for one night.
We ate at the pub on site, the food was really good and the servings were large. A little pricey, especially the drinks. They also have a 5 star restaurant that was booked by the time we arrived.
Our only complaint was the morning we were to leave and they were short staffed. We had arranged the night before to have a bellman at our room at 6am sharp(recommended by the concierge) to help with our bags and to have our rental car waiting. Neither happened. We carried our bags down and my husband retrieved the rental car from the garage. We were finally on our way about 6:20. Its about a 45 minute drive to the airport and by the time we returned our car and got to the terminal, about 7:15 we needed every minute to get through all the check in, security, etc. so allow plenty of time.",5,2017,08,07
217,Absolute Perfection!  Cannot wait to go back!,"We stayed at the Powerscourt for 4 nights in late July and it was noting short of perfection!  Our suite (644) was absolutely beautiful, over the top.  The service was phenomenal.  The room and bathrooms were sparkling.  Make sure you ask for a suite overlooking the mountains; it is worth the few extra dollars.  We had tea one day, which was fun with excellent food - the waitress was very subtle in asking if we understood how high tea actually works, and she walked us through it.  The Spa is one of the best I have been to - huge, excellent treatment menu, wonderful sanctuary room, wonderful pool with limited kids hours, and the two massages I had were excellent and reasonable priced!  We did have breakfast (a one-price buffet) each morning and it was well worth it!  Both traditional Irish specialties, as well as American (a pancake machine) and European (lovely cheeses and meats, excellent fruit) were served.  The breads and pastries were all fresh made and perfect.  We did not eat in the high end restaurant (Sika), but the menu looked quite good.  We did eat in the pub, which was a tiny bit cheesy.  They tried hard to recreate a traditional Irish pub, but it looked more like a RiRa's in the US. The food was good though, and the bartenders were excellent.  They knew their beers and their high end whacky very well.    All in all, this is one of the most beautiful hotels I have ever seen.  Better than the Ritz and the Plaza in New York.  It used to be owned by the Four Seasons, who recently sold it to Marriott, as they are expanding their Signature Collection.  This is one not to be missed!",5,2017,08,07
217,Well looked after,"From our arrival until we left we were well cared for. The room was very spacious and comfortable. We ate dinner in McGill's Bar and again the service was excellent. 
Breakfast was buffet style but instead of the usual dried up bacon and sausage you would associate with buffet breakfast the food was fresh and tasty. 
We would definitely stay here again. ",5,2017,08,07
217,Luxury in the Stunning Wicklow Mountains,"I travel a great deal, and had found this particular hotel through some research about its neighboring gardens. From the description, it sounded like a lovely hotel and resort, and as such, I booked us in for two nights, three days, of a two week tour of Ireland. I had few expectations, but quickly found the place to be wonderful and glorious in every way.  

Situated in one of the valleys at the base of Sugar Loaf mountain, the hotel's location is SPECTACULAR.  With not a bad view in site, the entire property lies in the middle of Ireland's glorious Wicklow county. For those of you who have not visited Wicklow, it's a must do in Ireland, offering some of the more gorgeous country the nation has to offer.   

We checked in, and quickly found our rooms to be comfortable, spacious, and well-designed.  We had great spaces to sit down and work on the laptop, and to mix a martini, as well as sit down and catch up on post-card writing. The bathroom's tub could fit a small giant, and provided a luxurious bath. We also had a shower in case one of us needed it.  Generous counter space, and an abundance of mirrors meant no one had to bump anyone out of the way in the morning. Also, the decor adds to the ambiance of subtle, luxurious, hunting lodge appeal. Beds were super-comfy.

The grounds - amazing. Gardens, forests, green lawns, abound in all directions. The property houses a world-class golf course, which I appreciated, despite the fact that I do not golf. The property also houses a world-class spa, pool, sauna, steam room, and fitness facility. The pool ranks among the top that I have experienced, and the steam room - with a huge crystal in its center - felt celestial in all ways.  

Service, five star. Food, exceptional, drinks with Sugar Loaf in the background - to die for.

The concierge organized a private tour for us to see Glendalough, the Wicklow Mountains, and Sally Gap - that private tour was one of the best I have experienced in many decades of traveling.  I highly recommend this property, and definitely plan on coming back soon. Bravo! 

Next door sits the Powerscourt Estate and Garden, which I also highly recommend to visit. The garden is among the finest I have ever seen.  You will not regret visiting this site, and staying at the hotel and resort makes it all the better.",5,2017,08,06
217,Beautiful hotel and beautiful area,"We stayed at the Powerscourt for 2 nights before flying home. We have been to Ireland but was anxious to visit the southeast since we were told that is where the Irish live and vacation. We started on the sea in Ardmore in County Waterford. We then went to Powerscourt for its great reputation and proximity to Dublin Airport (40-45 minutes).
Powerscourt is beautiful in its setting and design. Our room with mountain view was very large and beautifully done. The bathroom was more than luxurious.
We had dinner in McGills Pub and the restaurant on the main floor. The food was good and all were family friendly.
Our stand out experience was the wonderful concierge. He was the epitome of the well known Irish hospitality. I am only sorry I cannot name him.",5,2017,08,06
217,Final stop on golf trip headed back to Dublin,"Final stop on our way out of Ireland.  In a more remote location but the extra drive was worth it.  Spacious rooms, bathrooms and closet.  Our group ate at the bar only because we were running late getting to the hotel.  We had to leave in the morning, so are time here was limited.  The only downside was that we did not get he full experience the hotel had to offer.  Danielle in reservation was wonderful and Samuel in Guest relations was extremely helpful in getting us coordinated with 5 guys with 5 suitcases and golf clubs to the airport on time.  ",5,2017,08,06
217,perfect,this is our second time staying at this beautiful hotel. everything was just perfect from the bedroom suite to the leisure facilities to the staff. we opted for the package with dinner & again we were not disappointed. the staff members were attentive and plesant. our waitress who was from Hungary was a professional young lady who went above and beyond her duty in looking after us. Cedric the manager from france was chatty and a hive of information we enjoyed our meal immensely. will definately return again soon.  ,5,2017,08,05
217,Really relaxing stay,"My wife and myself had a very relaxing few days at Powerscourt. Wonderful experience from start to finish, if one likes being pampered. Services was good, food good (great b/f) and the rooms were excellent. The setting is also ideal with so much to do for everyone, golf, walks etc. It is also easy access to and from and close to some small towns wit good food and bars. We used most of the facilities and had no complaints hence the 5 rating. So for a good peaceful destination this will be high on our list in the future.",5,2017,08,03
217,Surely Six star!!,"We travel extensively & have had the privilege of staying in some of the best hotels. The Powerscourt would have to be the best yet. Our suite was the essence of luxurious opulence & the attention to detail was very evident. Lots of high tech gizmos such as the TV screen in the bathroom mirror! It's in a stunningly beautiful location with lots of pleasant walks. Friendly & efficient staff, the Sitka restaurant was excellent, breakfast was great. Only down side was that we only spent one night! We'd certainly be returning in the future.",5,2017,08,02
217,Disgraceful !! Thats what you call a 5 star ?!,"So when it comes to sharing experiences of Trip to Europe, the most important task seems to be rating this particular 5 star Hotel(?!) 
Looking at the website and the reviews on various mediums, i was too much attracted by this Irish property to treat my beautiful wife for her birthday. But turned out to be completely dissatisfying and terrible experience.
To begin with i wouldn't deny that location of property and the view from our room was exceptional. But then thats the only thing worth praising about this Hotel. 
To get into the details, our arrival at Hotel was not very much welcoming. Had to wait around 20 minutes to get checked in. And after that no help was provided with luggage carrying to the room. The confusing structure took us another 15 to 20 minutes getting to our room.
Our decision of having a quick lunch in lounge turned out to be distatseful. We waited for quite a long time before anyone could find us a table. Not to mention, almost a queue of 10 people was formed meanwhile, waiting to be seated. This doesn't end here. We just kept waiting forever to be attended and place order. All the staff seemed to be running around and the whole atmosphere was disorderly. All these while, i couldnt even locate any management presence to talk about this. Finally after a really long wait my wife had to approach a waitress to remind her to place our order. 
So in the evening was our turn to head to restaurant for dinner, because thats the only ""Fine-Dine"" option available here. It was totally opposite to the Lounge. We were humbly greeted by a very professional manager named Bhavik, who lead us to the table and familiarised us with the menu. Our fish and steak were deliciously cooked. It was my wife birthday. And for this at the end of our meal Bhavik treated us with a cake which a very sweet gesture. It was the only beautifully overwhelming experience we had with this hotel which made our evening. 
No matter what, i still wouldnt recommend my kiths and kins to visit this hotel for any luxurious 5 star experience.
",1,2017,08,02
217,Felt like a princess from start to finish!,"Stayed in this hotel with my boyfriend for two nights and it was like a dream. What a glorious place. I knew i loved it as soon as I saw complimentary copies of Ireland's best newspaper, the Irish Times. 

Huge rooms, gorgeous furniture, scenery, breakfast, gardens...... I could go on and on but I would only be repeating what a stunning place this was and how much I fell in love with it.

Yes it's expensive, but for a place like Powerscourt that's the price you have to pay! My boyfriend and I are already discussing getting married there. Thank you thank you thank you",5,2017,07,31
217,Very poor! Not a 5 Star hotel! ,"This is NOWHERE near a 5 star hotel!!!

While the food is good and the rooms nice and big, the rest is a total let down. The service is extremely poor, which is not a reflection on the lower level staff but on the lack of good experienced managers working in the hotel. Not once during the weekend were we asked by a waiter or manager whether they could help us with anything! Go stay in the Merrion or the Europe Hotel and you will experience proper service. Our stay cost in the region of €3,500 for my family for two nights and we felt like it was a hassle every time we wanted to order a drink. For example, I asked for a drinks reception for a party of 18 on the balcony (which is available for drinks) and the restaurant manager pretty much refused my request to wipe down the dirty tables and move some of the tables to make it look more appealing. Amateur! 
We were charged €64 per person for a 'set' 3 course menu on the Friday night and then on Sat for a more extensive 3 course menu it was only €55! How does that make sense? Do the math?!!

The hotel ran out of prosseco and all of the 'house' red wine at 7:45 on Sat evening. None of the staff seemed to know this until our order had already been taken! We made a booking reservation for dinner on Sat afternoon at reception. On arrival in the Sika restaurant, we were told no booking had been made. The manager questioned whether we had even made a booking and basically said she had no tables available for us! #FaultyTowers. It was only after we made a bit of a fuss that she miraculously produced a table even though one part of the restaurant was totally empty! 

The lobby, restaurant and corridors were freezing cold with the air-con booming out cold air. This was commented upon by lots of guests we met over the weekend. McGills Pub is, by 5 star standards, an absolute kip. It was more like Flannery's Pub on Camden street!

This hotel could be great but to get there it needs new professional management.  

5 star hotel?? Eh....no! There are 4 star hotels like Barberstown Castle that would wipe the floor with Powerscourt Hotel!",2,2017,07,31
217,One night stay,"Only stayed here one night on our way to cork but it was a really really nice hotel which has earned its 5* status, I didn't eat out of the hotel so not sure what the food is like, but the room was first class as well as the pool/spa. Also a very nice setting in the wicklow mountains",5,2017,07,31
217,Nice surroundings,"Powerscourt Hotel is like a giant, slightly bent, cruise ship. Its surroundings are truly beautiful, the Sugar Loaf mountain in the background and the proximity to Powerscourt Gardens makes its setting picture perfect. The hotel itself, here rated vs its 5-star grading, is a huge construction mostly resembling a giant cruise ship. we stayed in a 1-bedroom suite room on ""6th floor"" with a mountain view. The room was spacious, including a walk in closet and two restrooms and a very good bed. A balcony on the outside was nice to have but hard to use (no chairs etc to sit in). The mountain was somewhere there behind the trees, and probably more visible from the rooms in the center of the hotel than from ours. So, the room lives up to 5-star expectations, but the mountain view was not worth paying extra for. Surprisingly poor service when checking in at the normal check-in desk (there was another desk opposite with more staff - but that one was reserved for a bigger group/corporate guests). Very slow and reluctant service at check-in. The restaurants are OK. The more informal pub is in the center of the hotel on ""3rd floor"", and hence quite dark and probably a better alternative for late drinks than as an alternative for a dinner. Therefore, only one restaurant available as a real alternative for dinner.
All in all an average 5-star hotel (and quite expensive) where the things that make Powerscourt great are not associated with the hotel, but are the surroundings like the mountains, gardens and OK 36-hole golf course.",3,2017,07,31
217,Irish Bucolic Setting,"Only at this Hotel for 3 days, but again very lavish setting.  Had a very large room on the 6th floor with a balcony.  Great views of the countryside.  Our room was very comfortable with electric drapes operating off controls in the nightstand drawer.  Bathroom mirror had a in-mirror TV.  Room service was very prompt and the food was very good.  All the Hotel staff was extremely friendly and ready to engage in a conversation at the drop of a hat.  The doorman was lots of fun to speak with and loaded with information about Ireland.  Walking distance to the Japanese Garden attraction.  Just simply great stay.",5,2017,07,30
217,Not worth €325 a night,Have to say very disappointed about this stay. We were down for my mothers 70th. Staff are very rude and smart. Clearly not trained well. They ran out of Proseco and some wines. Worse Irish breakfast I've had. Completely tasteless. Looks the business but all that glitters isn't gold sadly. They had a charge on my room for a movie I never watched. When I questioned it the receptionist was smart and then didn't even look at me when she handed me my bill. Dinner was good. Like this was a 700 euro weekend just for bed and breakfast. Total rip off. Rooms are nice as are the grounds but there are nicer places in ireland with friendlier service. It lives off its name. I paid 32 euro for a club sandwich and onion rings. What a joke. Would never stay here again. ,2,2017,07,30
217,Beauty off the path,Grand hotel with a staff that is exceptional beyond measure. Our room was large with a marble bathroom and separate closet and changing room. The lobby was decorated with different fresh flowers everyday. We did not stay in a suite but saw one and it had separate bathrooms living room and library. The grounds were just as beautiful as the hotel itself!,5,2017,07,29
217,"""Elegance Personified...""","I've stayed at some pretty amazing places over the years, but this one rates at the top for comfort and posh elegance. Huge room with all the amenities a person could imagine. Fabulous indoor pool and hummam style spa. Beautiful grounds, and adjacent to the estate house and luxurious gardens are a must see, while your here. Just a short drive to Dublin, this majestic countryside location is a resort getaway of unprecedented luxury. ",5,2017,07,29
217,"Three Years Ago, I gave it a 5 Star review; Oh what Happened???","As previously reviewed, this hotel is simply stunning. The hotel is architecturally stunning, the grounds beautiful and the area is picturesque. So what caused me to significantly change my review? Well, it is all about the service, which at least during our stay, was nowhere to be found.

Apparently during our stay, there was a large corporate event at the hotel, so perhaps all the staff were catering to their needs, as they were nowhere to be found to service the other guests.

Oh, and if you are a Platinum member, that means absolutely nothing at this hotel. Not even an acknowledgement upon check-in. We had hoped for an early check-in (around noon) but were told that check-in is at 4PM. They took my number and never called. We checked back with the front desk at 3PM and again they stated that check is was at 4PM. No phone calls were made and we finally went back at 5PM and they said our rooms were ready. Pathetic customer service. And they were not at all friendly or apologetic. They really could care less about the customer.

We visited the front desk on numerous occasions during our stay seeking advise on restaurants and directions, and the lines were huge. Literally, the hotel front desk was so understaffed that at times, it took 30 minutes just to ask a question. But if you were part of the Corporate Group, their front desk had lots of staff, with no lines. but they could not help you, unless you were part of the corporate group.

The hotel also has a pub on property. During our last visit, the pub had nightly live music, not anymore.

During our last visit, the hotel offered a shuttle to bring guests into town for dinner. Now the policy is that they run the car at the top of each hour. How silly. So at 7PM, you have many guests looking to get a ride into town with only 1 car making the run. So you literally have to wait for the car to shuttle folks to town until it is your turn. What an asinine policy, as they should simply offer to drive folks to town when that are interested in going into town. And good luck trying to a car back to the hotel post dinner. It is like a circus as guests are coming out of the different restaurants and no-one knows who called first.

Lastly, the beds are way too soft; so getting a good nights rest is challenging at best.

So it seems to me that this hotel is mismanaged at many levels. We will never stay here again and I would suggest that before you book a room with them, it might be worthwhile to see if a corporate event is taking place and avoid the hotel if there is.",2,2017,07,28
217,A must see in Ireland.,"Websites and photos online don't do this hotel justice.  Irish hospitality at its finest from front desk agents, bellmen, restaurant staff and concierge. Our bellman explained every feature of our luxurious room which absolutely came in handy.  We walked the path around the hotel after dinner where we found rose gardens and a life size Chess board.  The epic Irish breakfast cannot be forgotten. I cannot wait to come back for another visit.   Absolutely breathtaking!",5,2017,07,28
217,"Wonderful, but... miserable","I am traveling throughout the world for my work and I easily sleep in hotel more than 150 nights per year.
I have gold or platinum status with several hotel brands....
Well, my Company had a meeting in this hotel, involving more that 100 people. 
Everything was perfect, but at the time of checking out (4am in the morning: I had to catch an early flight) the hotel receptionist firstly charged some expenses I never did and, secondly, refuse to recognize my 3 nights as qualifying nights because my company paid on my behalf....
This last issue is absolutely a nonsense in my opinion: I stayed in the hotel and without me inside the hotel room the hotel wouldn't have gained the money for my stay.
Money paid to the hotel were real, yet my stay wasn't a qualifying one.
This is miserable. And please don't say that you applied Marriott rewards rules.
Marriott should have cared much more about their loyal members. 
From now on I will never ever pass another night in Marriott hotels and I will strongly discourage all friends (and my company, too) to have business again with an hotel chain such a miserable attitude towards a customer. Best regards.",1,2017,07,28
217,Great Property,"We just came back from our trip.  The property from the lobby, grounds  to the large rooms and  views  beats the rest al  the other 4  highly rated hotels we  had visited.  One of the managers (Micheal Byrnes) was nice enough to allow our daughter to take photos from one of the mountain view rooms. Staff friendly and professional .  Loved the SPA.  Enjoyed Powerscourt Gardens and the  water fall.  Will be back",5,2017,07,25
217,Incredible hotel nestled in a magnificent sprawling estate,"This beautiful hotel has outstanding staff, breathtaking views and so much to offer.  The Powerscourt was the first stop on our ten day adventure in Ireland.  After our transatlantic flight, we arrived at the hotel at 7:30am and were greeted warmly by the staff who assured us that our accommodations were ready for us to check in.  The room was spacious, spotless and offered spectacular views. 

The grounds are vast and manicured to perfection with its own golf course, many walking trails and much more. Definitely a top ten resort.",5,2017,07,23
217,Exquisite!,"One of the best suites I've ever stayed in.  HUGE balcony!  Gorgeous views!  Kitchen, dressing room, full size living room and dining area.  I really can't say enough about how fabulous it was.  It was my last 2 days of a long 2 week trip in Ireland and it was a perfect place to treat myself for the end of a wonderful trip.  The best thing though was after I left.  I left my eyeglasses on the sofa in the lobby while i was waiting for my cab.  I had prescription sunglasses on so I didn't notice. When I got to Dublin I was panicking.  I cannot see without my glasses and sunglasses at night are not very helpful.  The hotel in Dublin phoned Powerscourt and a young man that works there brought me my glasses when he got off work.  It was really a bad situation for me and Powerscourt staff saved my behind!  Thank you so much!!!",5,2017,07,22
217,Construction stay away!,"Very disappointed by recent stay.  No notice on website or when checking in, but major construction going on! Coming in from the states and it was non stop. Could not take it more than two days, and front desk was not helpful any of the four different times we called down to complain.  Beautiful spot, but wait until construction complete!",3,2017,07,20
217,One of the best ever,"I travel a lot and have stayed in many places, but this hotel ranks near the top of my list in just about every category.  Can't say enough good things about it.  I guess if you're after the nightlife in a large city like Dublin you might be disappointed, however it is perfect if you want to get away and see some of the sights out and around the major cities.  Highly recommend.",5,2017,07,20
217,Wonderful,"We loved our stay at this hotel, it's beautiful and the location is pretty special, it was definitely the best place we stayed in during our visit to Ireland.  Our family enjoyed a very spacious room, more of a suite actually.  The Breakfast Buffet has something for everyone to enjoy, and then some! The restaurant and bar were really good, the pub was fun and so convenient being in the hotel. The staff were always a pleasure to deal with, we would definitely return another time.",5,2017,07,20
217,Amazing but pricey,"We stayed in this amazing hotel last weekend and I am blown away how gorgeous it is especially when you get the weather. It is very expensive tho you would definatly buy urself a nice week holiday in Spain for the money we spend in there over one night stay, food was gorgeous yet again it's fine dinning restaurant so bill was shocking. Spa was absolutely breath taking worth every penny we spend in there, definatly worth visiting. Overall i think our mistake was to check in late in afternoon so we didn't have the time to take the most of what the hotel had to offer if you are looking to get away from reality and give your bank card a bit of a shake that's the place to go.",4,2017,07,20
217,Ultimate stay in Ireland,Spent the last 4 days of our holiday at Powerscourt Hotel.  I wanted to have a special stay for my wifes' birthday so I decided to stay her for four days.  We were thrilled!  We stayed in a mountain view king suite and were very pleased with both the room and views.  The hotel is grand in every way.  Staff is friendly and restaurants were very good.,5,2017,07,19
217,Incredible,"This may be the nicest hotel I have ever stayed in.  It would be worth going back to Ireland just to stay in this hotel.  

It was just insanely beautiful.  The service was good.  The food in the bar was good as well.  But the lobby, the grounds, and the hotel itself are what make this place special.  

I cannot say enough about how impressive the facilities are. We had two rooms and both were superb.  One of the rooms was a suite and, as you might expect, it was huge and lavish.  The regular room was very nice as well though.  Obviously everything was spotless.

The costs were not nearly as bad as I expected either.  The rooms were reasonably priced.  The meal at the bar only cost a little more than what I would have paid at a pub.  Therefore, I cannot recommend this hotel strongly enough.",5,2017,07,18
217,Amazing in many ways but need to keep the toddlers out of the spa pool ,The hotel is quit beautiful and the spa is amazing but my husband and I were relaxing by the pool and at 4:00pm they let kids come to the spa pool and it is extremely loud. It is an amazing spa pool and in the spa I think they should keep it adults only ......also they are in swim diapers and I have issues with that ...on the other hand - lizette the concierge is amazing!!! Love her!!- ,3,2017,07,18
217,One of the most beautiful hotels!,"I have been lucky enough to stay in some fantastic hotels throughout the world and I will tell you that this is probably the most beautiful.  We were on our way to Dublin and stopped here for only one night in order to go to the gardens.  Since it was my husband and I with our two daughters so we got two rooms.  We had a suite which was stunning and overlooked the back grounds.  The girls had a standard room which was huge.  
The restaurant was delicious and the service impeccable.",5,2017,07,17
217,Expensive but worth it,was here for a girlie weekend and we all loved the place. the entrance foyer oozed class as you walked in. the rooms were fabulous with white tiled walls and even a tv screen in the mirror in the morning as you brushed your teeth. the wine left in the room was wlaso absolutely relish.,5,2017,07,17
217,Relaxing Retreat,"I would highly recommend staying at the Powerscourt Hotel. We were upgraded to a suite with a balcony which was beautifully laid out and well equipped.The balcony had a view over the grounds and Sugar Loaf mountain which was stunning.It was lovely to sit out on the balcony and relax and enjoy the view. The staff were very welcoming and friendly. The service was excellent. We had dinner in the restaurant, it was beautiful. We thoroughly enjoyed the experience.Breakfast the next morning was lovely with a great selection.My husband used the pool and the Jacuzzi and found the experience very relaxing. I would definitely stay again.",5,2017,07,16
217,The bed...,"Oh man.  We had traveled from the US West Coast to Dublin.  It was a very long day and a half, and we were exhausted.  We had decided to stay close to Dublin knowing that we would be tired.  The last road to the hotel is narrow, but all the cars worked around each other.  We arrived.  It is so beautiful.  All the staff is super friendly, save one.  The tall receptionist was a bit less than welcoming, but we only dealt with her briefly.  Then, we got to our room.  They will not disappoint.  I fell back on the bed, (admittedly a dramatic move on my part), but it was so comfortable.  I travel a lot for work and, hands down, this was the most comfortable bed I have ever slept in.  I will be trying to recreate it at home.  -  We were traveling with two kids and a senior.  The shower is walk in- a total plus for mobility challenged.  And although the floor is marble, it was not slippery when wet.  There is so much for the kids to run around and do.  The pool hours for kids are limited, so take advantage of it.  But, do not miss the pool and spa area, it is a must see.  If you don't like to swim, just go down for a nap on the lounge chair during the non-kid hours.  It is so relaxing.   If I lived close by, this would be a weekend get away spot to recoop.  ",5,2017,07,16
217,Luxurious Stay!,"My family and I stayed here for a one night treat in June. We reserved a deluxe room interconnecting with a classic suite.  We had more than enough space as both of the rooms has great wardrobe/dressing room space that really extended the rooms.  The bathrooms were particularly  impressive and not so much because of their lovely baths with separate walk in showers but because of their great lighting and every angle mirrors.  Very often this is overlooked, but not here.  My children were delighted with a double bed each in the same room. Our classic suite had a nice interior but for the best part was very dark even though this was a fine day in Summer.  The rooms faced the rear of the property, I was really surprised by this because I would have thought that all bedrooms forward faced the view, but they don't.  Breakfast the following morning was busy but was handled perfectly by all the breakfast staff who were very pleasant.  The selection was good. I had Eggs Benedict and they were delicious. My husband and children went swimming, they reported the pool to be very good.  I took advantage of the a coffee in the lobby area and the newspaper.  This is a very relaxing area with lots of lovely natural light.  We checked out efficiently, even though there was a queue there was plenty of staff so there was no waiting around.  This was a lovely treat, I would highly recommend it for some time out to re-charge and relax.",5,2017,07,16
217,Family day away ,"Visited here with my Mam, sister and her kids. Had an enjoyable nights stay. The bedroom was huge. On entrance to the right was a great sized bathroom with a bath and shower and the wow factor the TV in the mirror. To the left of the entrance a walk in wardrobe area. You walked down a short hall to a sitting room area which was elegantly furnished and had a big TV. It was very comfortable and homely. Through two small slider doors then was the bedroom area. Two decent sized queen beds and TV in the area also. The beds were comfortable and it was very quiet so got a great nights sleep. We had a balcony area which was huge and had an amazing view of the sugar loaf and the beautiful gardens that was my favourite part. The pool area the kids loved but the time was restricted which I completely get as it is within the spa/ thermal area. The food was very good we ate in McGills Bar as we had the kids. There was great choice on the menu both the bar menu and kids menu. The portions were big and the food was very tasty. I sampled a few Gin cocktail in the sugar loaf lounge which were really good and the barman was so friendly. The breakfast the next morning was great the selection was huge and so fresh. There was a kitchen menu for fresh egg dishes but we opted for the self serve hot breakfast which I am glad we did. The pancake maker was a huge plus for the kids they visited a few times. It was a nice family night away and very close to the powerscourt waterfall which is a must do. ",4,2017,07,14
217,Let down by mediocre dining experience,"I spent a night here with my wife and was very impressed with the facilities and room. It met with my expectations of a five star hotel, it was very nice. However, the Sika restaurant ambience was quite loud and soulless. The service was pretty slow (although I was in absolutely no rush) and the food was just about warm. In fairness to the staff I didn't bother complaining and we just finished up and left. Bit of a let down, I expected more as it was on the expensive side.",3,2017,07,11
217,Relaxing place to stay,"The staff here are all really friendly and clearly want you to enjoy your stay
The pool area is cool and relaxing and they sensibly set special hours when children are or are not welcome. Large modern gym 
Breakfast is excellent and I recommend the eggs benedict. 
The room was large with a truly superb bathroom. They could rearrange the furniture to put in another easy chair as the room was a bit cavernous.
Powerscourt gardens are glorious and we also enjoyed taking out the cycles available from the hotel",5,2017,07,11
217,Superb Spa ,"Booked myself and my daughter for a Sunday morning set of Spa treatments - a 50 minute and an 80 minute - checked in nice and early and took the opportunity to chill out in the Serenity room - lovely beds with a fine view - set the scene well

I had the 80 minute massage - very good muscle relaxant and iron out - would increase the pressure next time but this hit the spot and was a full body massage - my daughter had a 50 minute session - equally as good 

I took the opportunity for a steam bath afterwards  - very good - should have stayed longer. 

Only one suggestion which is the reason for the four stars - recommend the Spa provides some razors for a shave and combs for hair and a few other items to complete the pampering experience 

Tip - allow enough time either side of the massager treatment to enjoy all the facilities 

Will return and spend more time in this excellent location ",4,2017,07,10
217,Stunning country estate,We only had 2 nights but next time i'd stay a week and explore the gardens and surroundings more. the hotel is absolutely stunning and feels like total luxury. I can imagine a girls weekend away with the day spa booked would be the absolute dream!,5,2017,07,09
217,Nothing but pure luxury ,"Last weekend, my family and friends stayed in Powerscourt for a classy hens do!
Obviously we knew that Powerscourt had a high reputation going, but to say we were all blown away is an understatement. From the moment we walked in, the staff were more than helpful. Lobby and lounge area- just lovely with wonderful views. 
The bedrooms. Oh my goodness the bedrooms. I was blessed enough to stay in a suite... When we walked in we actually couldn't get over it. We didn't want to leave the room! Two full length windows over looking the fountain and the sugar loaf- what more could you desire. Rooms were SPOTLESS. The bathroom was bigger than my own house- just stunning. Tv In the bathroom, bath and shower was exquisite.
The breakfast was the most impressive buffet I've seen. Fruit, scones, mini croissants, cereal, granola, full fry, fresh honey on the comb!!! You name it, they have it- and lots of it. 
When we were going out for dinner that night, we went to ask for a complimentary drive to the town. Ben immediately grabbed the keys and brought us. Ben is an absolute gentleman. Professional, friendly and hardworking. 
The pool/ spa treatments again second to none.  Candlelit pool area, perfect temp. Jacuzzi also a great treat. I fell asleep for an hour on the beds! 
Above all I actually can't find a fault in this place. Obviously the price is daunting for some, but oh is it worth it. For any special occasion you have- go here!

217,What an experience.,"From start to finish our stay was sensational. I wanted a relaxing hens party so myself, my mother and my 4 bridesmaids stayed in Powerscourt Hotel. The staff were incredible, especially Ben. He helped us with our T.V and dropped us to the town that evening. I am so blown away by the whole experience that i have just book for myself and my fiance to return after our wedding in September. The rooms are breathtaking and the mountain view is certainly worth the extra cost. 

The pool has a lake type feel to it and the spa was amazing. I got a massage and will absolutely be getting another one when i return in September. 

Thank you to all the staff for making our stay so special.",5,2017,07,09
217,Luxury at its finest,"Luxury at its finest
I had the pleasure of staying in Powerscourt hotel as part of a work conference. I’ve stayed in many hotels all over the world and even though it’s only an hour from my house the hotel made me feel I could have been anywhere! Tucked away amongst the Wicklow mountains the scenery is to die for. The hotel is famous for their spectacular gardens to which the hotel forms a backdrop to.
The hotel itself has managed to perfectly blend a mix of modern facilities and design with an old world, rustic feel. The suites are beautiful and definitely have the I-don’t-want-to-leave-my-room  effect.
The staff over the course over the two days were absolutely brilliant. Nothing ever felt like too much trouble and everything was done with a smile. Staff and management stopped to chat to guests and returning guests and it gave the hotel a very relatable, warm feel to it.
The residence bar is also designed to be like a traditional Irish pub which is another unique touch.
I was so impressed with everything the hotel had to offer and will definitely be returning soon to enjoy all that Powerscourt has to offer.
Yes, it’s expensive to eat and drink, spa etc. but you get what you pay for 10 times over and I defy anyone not to stay at Powerscourt and not come back refreshed and chilled out as it’s a very ‘forget all your worries’ type of hotel.",5,2017,07,07
217,Great location to discover the Wicklow Mountains and beautiful accommodation,"Beautiful room with great views. The service was terrific and the concierge was outstanding. nothing was a bother and all the staff at this desk were extremely helpful, knowledgeable and friendly.
Whilst we were a little disappointed with the food served in the dining room, we were really happy with the room service meals.  The breakfasts were great and when the staff realised we were going for a drive through the mountains they kindly packed up a box of pastries for our trip.
Plenty of parking with the option of leaving your luggage at the door and having your car parked for you. The boys helping with the luggage are a great asset. 
all in all, it was a lovely stay in a beautiful location with lovely walks and just a short drive the the  Powerscourt Waterfall which is certainly worth the trip.",5,2017,07,06
217,Lovely country hotel ,We really loved staying at the Powerscourt Hotel. We were upgraded to a roomy suite that was comfortable and full of all the amenities. We recommend room 447.  The hotel grounds were beautiful and there were many wonderful walking trails. The nearby town of Enniskerry was an easy walk.  We enjoyed the hotel pub. The main breakfast buffet (included  in the price) was plentiful but sometimes the wait staff seemed overwhelmed with all the people. The hotel was an excellent value. ,5,2017,07,05
217,Luxury,"Loved staying here. The grounds, the hotel, the staff, the walks, the food everything was fabulous. I won a prize for 2 nights B&B, one dinner, a treatment each and entry into the house and gardens. And it was FABULOUS. Can not recommend it enough to people. Probably as a treat (for us mere mortals) but still if you ever can go you should.",5,2017,07,05
217,Pure Luxury 5 *****,"This Hotel is worth everyone of its 5*****. It is beautifully designed inside & out. The Ambience of the Hotel & the warmth & friendliness of the staff is a credit to all who work their.
The location of the Powerscourt Hotel is superb in a beautiful rural setting. A great place for walks, cycling & golf. Also for relaxing in the Spa or the swimming pool or a gym session for the energetic.
The food was delicious. You can choose to pay less & to eat in the bar downstairs. I would recommend the afternoon tea for 2 for 39 euro as a treat. The upstairs restaurant menu has lovely sea food chowder 8 euro for lunch.
We thoroughly enjoyed this Hotel and all the local attractions near by ie: Powerscourt Waterfall, Powerscourt Gardens is a must. Falconry, plenty of walks & cycles. Avoca to go shopping.",5,2017,07,04
217,International Luxury,"Amazing rooms and spa in this International style hotel. The Ireland experience is limited to the beautiful view of the Sugarloaf and an Irish themed pub.

217,Super value and very upscale,"We stayed in Dublin and London for 5 weeks and this property was the best value,  facilities, and service.

It is in a rural setting outside of Dublin, but if you have a car it is a short distance from the m50. Due to the terrible traffic in the city center I actually found it easier to get to meetings from here than from the city center.

The furnishings and fittings were modern and high end, lacking nothing. We paid a bit extra for a high floor garden view -- and the view was spectacular. It was peak summer season but the rates here were lower than three star hotels in the city center.",5,2017,07,01
217,This has the Wow factor,"Stayed here for one night as part of the contract signing for a Conference we are holding here next year. Everything about this place is just quality. Stunning parkland and views surround the hotel. Wonderful friendly service no matter where you are, reception, spa, bar, restaurant. Food is very good .Rooms are all well appointed and I probably slept in the most comfortable bed ever. Did not try the golf course but the Spa is a place where you just have to go.
Can't wait to go back.",5,2017,06,30
217,Paradise in Ireland,"My husband and I stayed at Powerscourt for 9 days. It was fabulous. The moment one drives up to the front doors and receives a friendly greeting from Zolt and Kyle (awesome Bellmen), our room request being met from the front desk clerk ( I think her name was Katie) and in general being made to feel extremely welcome, one knows that Powerscourt is a special place.  Our room was beautiful. It looked out on Sugar Loaf Mountain and the gardens.  What a view.  My trip to the  spa was extremely relaxing and the spa and pool area are beautiful. Additionally, Robbie assisted us in getting to see the beautiful grounds, suggested places to visit and in general addressed us each day to make sure we were having a pleasant stay.    Our meals were always good as was the service. We are already planning a return tip in April of 2018 and cannot wait to get back to our ""Paradise in Ireland"" .",5,2017,06,29
217,Quality throughout with modern touches,"A large but beautifully kept hotel in a rural location not too far from Dublin.

Rooms were notable for their high quality furnishings, spaciousness and modern touches (although I still can't quite get my head around why I really need a touch screen to turn on the bedside lights or a flat screen tv within the bathroom mirror...)

Several food options - all good, especially the extensive breakfast buffet.

Everything seemed brand new.

V impressive. 

I look forward to returning here for a holiday one day soon.",5,2017,06,28
217,Unique property,"Stayed 2 nights on Marriott points.  Breakfast was very extensive and for platinums it was included.  Our room, which I guess was true to all rooms, was very modern and in perfect condition.  Lots of marble, flat screen tvs.  We had a 1 bedroom suite and it was superb with a great view of the mountains and large fountain.  Nice spa.",5,2017,06,27
217,Birthday celebration,"Room was simply fabulous. However, there are a number of areas which require improvement - the service was poor in the restaurant during the day, I had to ask for a menu and then to order when it wasn't even busy. The bar didn't open until 6 meaning you had to eat in the restaurant. The bar itself doesn't fit with the overall ambience of the hotel, think being dressed up for fine dining to then feel like you are sitting in a local country pub. We found the evening food in the restaurant overpriced and not very spectacular...the pool area was nice. Overall, I felt this hotel is lacking the finesse they claim to encapsulate...",4,2017,06,26
217,Excellent and outstanding ,"Just enjoyed a break in Wicklow stayed at the Powerscourtbhotel, Autograph Collection by MARRIOT- great spot very close to Powerscot house and the waterfall.

The hotel was very nice rooms and were spacious and very quiet stayed on the 3rd floor.

Food was very good. 

Ioilana from Romania was very pleasant, efficient, excellent a pleasure to meet her at all times. 

The staffs were very helpful and friendly. 

They could not do enough for us to make our stay fantastic. 

Thank you",5,2017,06,26
217,Beautiful property,"Great views, good food and drinks. Plenty do do around. What a relaxing weekend. Pool is a must! The room was spacious and luxurious. Property very well kept. Loved the details specially the Mirror TV.
Cant wait to be back",5,2017,06,25
217,Amazing,"This place is simply amazing! Only stayed for one night but wish it had been for longer, we did try to book a second night but they had no room ☹️ 
Food is top notch, make sure you go early for breakfast and enjoy all they have to offer - we couldn't get enough. 
The facilities are second to none, we were so happy and relaxed the entire time - just what a new mum and dad needed for some well deserved couple time. 
The staff are so helpful and friendly and the place itself is just stunning! We didn't want to leave! ",5,2017,06,24
217,Worth every penny and then some,"I have traveled all over Europe and North America and this is the best hotel I have visited. Its gorgeous, of course, but not just the outside and the lobby and the grounds and the perfect view of the Wicklow Mountains. The rooms are spectacular. Our room was bigger than most suites and thoroughly comfortable. The bath was marble and huge. The bed was super comfortable. We had a balcony overlooking the mountains. The room has more high tech than a spaceship. You can control everything from a touchscreen cleverly stored in your bedside table. The service was first class. Treat yourself. Put this place on your bucket list. (Get the breakfast package, the food is great)",5,2017,06,24
217,Mountain view suites are stunning.,"Stayed for another visit here and had a stunning mountain view suite this time. Spa and pool excellent as always. Food and service very good in McGill's again, the two young men there are particularly good as are all the women. It would have been a five star review had it not been for a disappointing room service meal, very ordinary chicken burger with precisely seven chips with it and the smallest Caesar salad I've ever gotten with a few cold prawns on it. We were actually hungry afterwards. Odd when the portions are generous in the pub downstairs. But that won't stop us returning again. It's still our favourite.",4,2017,06,22
217,The staff are very friendly,"We stayed here for two nights for my husbands 80th birthday we were upgraded to a suite at no extra cost and  a bowl of fruit was delivered to our room. The food was delicious. The Spa area is lovely and all the staff are lovely nothing is too much for them.
The breakfast is fantastic with lots to choose from. I would recommend this hotel.",5,2017,06,22
217,Beautiful 5 star Hotel ,"Hands down the best hotel I've ever stayed in. Top customer service, smiles all round. Cocktails were amazing. Food was the best and that was in the pub bar. Breakfast was set out lovely with beautiful views. Bedrooms were top luxury. Thank you Powerscourt for a wonderful stay. My best friend is getting married there and we're counting down the days. ",5,2017,06,21
217,Short Break,"Marvellous Hotel to stay in with huge rooms and all creature comforts. Booked a Spa break which also included one nights evening meal. Very pleased to find that there was no additional charges for ANY of the menu, very unusual. Food was good.

Spa was excellent as was the pool and facilities

Breakfast was very good. The only reason for score is that it was very noisy then. 

 This was also where the evening meal was served and was a bit too ""open and impersonal"" for us. Many thanks to Cedric for looking after my wife who is gluten/shell fish allergic. He went out of his way to ensure nothing would be wrong.",4,2017,06,21
217,Very nice,"I have stayed in the hotel in June for two nights. 
Can't say anything bad about this hotel.

Food at the hotel was great, the staff is very friendly. 
Breakfast was amazing. 

I had booked a double room and it was one massive double room. Toiletries were very nice, as it should be in a 5-star hotel.",5,2017,06,20
217,Super! ,"We loved everything about Powerscourt ! Spectacular views, superb service by friendly staff, comfortable room! Can't say enough good things about it. Every staff member we interacted with was courteous and helpful. The spa was relaxing and I loved the Serenity room after my massage. We didn't have a car so very much appreciated the courtesy car drivers who cheerfully shuttled us to and from Enniskerry, the golf course and the Gardens. We've stayed in many wonderful hotels around the world but this place felt very special.",5,2017,06,16
217,"A hotel for Americans, devoid of atmosphere","Stayed here with a friend for a birthday celebration recently. The only nice thing about it is the spa. The suite was just average, and I was surprised to see the wallpaper coming off the wall - seriously, in a 5 star hotel which is ridiculously priced? 

There is a complete lack of atmosphere in the open lobby/bars - no music playing, the reception staff don't make an effort to converse, and it's very cold. 

The surroundings are wonderful, luckily because there is really nothing to keep you in the hotel. 

The bar drinks have a five star price tag. They have the most expensive cocktail list I have ever seen - 18 Euro - ridiculous!

While I did enjoy the spa experience which is 5 star, I won't be rushing back here. The lacks heart and soul.",3,2017,06,15
217,My favorite hotel thus far,"This magnificent hotel sits on a lush, private gated parcel. So many walking/running trails and gorgeous scenery abound. The staff was excellent. My room was a magnificent suite with large windows in bedroom and living room of the tranquil grounds. Many choices for dining or room service. Such a relaxing getaway. A bit of a drive from Dublin but well worth it. Highly recommended!",5,2017,06,15
217,True 5 star hotel ,"Stayed in this hotel for quick 1 night stay. Check in good and staff took bags and brought us to room . Room was lovely , tv in bathroom , electronic device to close and open curtains . Complementary shoe shine service . Breakfast was great and upkeeping with 5 star service  . Stayed in a lot of 5 star hotels and many you wonder how they got the award but this hotel is good , very good . Staff great also . Well done . ",5,2017,06,14
217,Marriott's Best,"If you are planning a trip to Dublin, consider spending at least part of your trip at the Powerscourt. You will be happy that you did! I travel the world for my job and as a Marriott platinum member, I have stayed at in many of their top hotels.  This is THE BEST!  The pool and spa are unbelievable!",5,2017,06,13
217,Lovely stay,"Powerscourt is such a beautiful hotel.

The staff are lovely, and have improved alot since the initial takeover. Nicholas at reception in particular was incredibly friendly and helpful.
We stayed in a suite - it was absolutely stunning with views onto the mountain. We didn't want to leave! 

Unfortunately the hotel drops the ball on the small touches. We were asked if we'd like a complimentary newspaper, but this was never brought to us. It also took 3 attempts to get 2 jugs of water brought to the room with our dinner, and in the end we only got 1 jug. We were initially charged for an extra breakfast as they said the room booking was only for 1 person. These are small details by themselves, but together they were heading towards being a bigger issue. 

Overall the small issues were annoying, but I would stay again.",4,2017,06,12
217,Top notch ,This is a really excellent place to stay and truly deserves it 5 stars. The Superior room is very spacious and beautifully furnished. The Sika restaurant is a delight and I can recommend it for fine dining. ,5,2017,06,11
217,Beautiful way to start our tour of Ireland!,"We started our tour of Ireland at Powerscourt last week. They were so kind to allow us to check in early! The room was large and very clean.  It was so nice to walk over to the gardens, which were stunning! We walked up to see the horses on our way back to the hotel. The view is amazing. The very nice bellman drove us into Enniskerry and told us about each restaurant. He told us to call the hotel and he would return to get us. We were very impressed with the hospitality shown to us. It was a wonderful start to a great vacation!",5,2017,06,09
217,Friends Wedding,Truly magical venue for wedding ceremony and reception. Rooms were impressive- the bathroom I wanted to take home. Bed was comfy and enjoyed best night sleep in a long while. Staff were nothing but kind and very helpful. Will definitely be back. ,5,2017,06,08
217,Loved it!,"Living in the U.K and having best friends that live in Ireland, our time together is rare. They insisted that our next spa break should be to the Powerscourt and they were so right!
From start to finish it was wonderful. The staff are polite, friendly, helpful and happy. The bedrooms that we had, 308 and 309 were spacious, clean and extremely comfortable so much so that I would have been happy to spend more time there if it wasn't for the stunning spa which never seemed to be overly busy. I had two treatments, the hot stone massage by therapist Nicola, ten out of ten to her and I also had the regenerating facial and again superb. Lunch at the spa was also faultless and very tasty, pre-ordering is a good idea.
My friend and I did the river walk, peaceful and simply beautiful. There is so much to do here, something for everyone. I plan to return very soon with my family...show them what we are missing!
The only negative for me was Mcgills pub, service and food were average so we didn't eat there again.
Powerscourt is one of the best I've been to and I really can't wait to return.",5,2017,06,08
217,Disappointing,"I booked a stay here for my husband's birthday. The hotel itself  is nice, rooms are lovely. We had dinner in the bar and it was disappointing. First of all we were waiting to get a table. We ordered our meal, twenty minutes later, the waiter apologised  for the delay, another twenty minutes and we got another apology. We were told that the kitchen is a satellite kitchen and they were very busy. Finally after 55 minutes we got our meal, and it was average. We ordered dessert my husband got his and I was left waiting..a few minutes later I got mine, but it wasn't what I had ordered. More apologies from staff and I finally get my dessert. The following morning we had breakfast, which was ok. The dining room was untidy and cobwebs around. Checking out the receptionist was rude. Very disappointed  with our stay. It's not the service you would expect from 5 star hotel.",3,2017,06,08
217,Powerscourt Hotel Wicklow review by the secret hotel inspector,"when you do it right .... you do it right!   Oppulent yet friendly - staff are wonderful I would like to mention a young girl mary who was a pleasure and made our stay special.   The food:  a lot of choices all excellent and a substantial wine list
staff:  extremely professional, happy and so we were told - well paid
management: totally professional and always on hand when you need anything
rooms: fantastic!  clean, magnificent, plenty of toiletries, beautiful view 
sleep: zzzzzzzzzz yes
noise level: quiet and tranquil

A note on the reception staff - simply wonderful and we thank you for your courtesy

Type of vacation: starchy if you want and opulent but tranquil and quaint if that is what you are looking for

Family: yes
Couples: absolutely yes

Very unusual for the secret hotel inspector to give 5 stars but well deserved to all.  Perfect hotel, staff and beautiful surroundings with plenty to do.

Location: magnificent, lots to do locally if you can manage to drag yourself away from this little piece of heaven",5,2017,06,07
217,Wonderful 2 days,"Just returned from a 2 night stAy celebrating our wedding anniversary. We had a terrific time . We were upgraded to a beautiful suite . The hotel and spa are very luxurious and even though the hotel was full, it certainly did not feel crowded. Breakfast and dinner in Sika restaurant could not be faulted and service throughput was excellent in particular Denise at reception and TRavis in SIka.
Surrounding Powerscourt estate is the perfect setting for this great hotel.
All in all , highly recommended ",5,2017,06,07
217,Simply Brilliant!,"Had a great stay, fabulous views, massive rooms and thank goodness friendly and not starchy service!! Great food, great staff with nothing too much trouble. Will be back for sure! Views are stunning and Dave on the door a fountain of knowledge. Kinga in the lounge and young Nino were stand outs for us. Great job guys keep it up!

",5,2017,06,06
217,"Incredible experience, cannot rate this highly enough","I've just returned after spending 2 nights in Powerscourt and felt I had to write a review given how fantastic this place is. Ok, it is expensive (lets just get that out up front) but that's no secret. 

So, on arrival you drive through a wonderful entrance, long tree-lined driveway, golf couress on the right and a view of the sugarloaf mountain on the left. The hotel itself is a very impressive sight as you approach. There is plenty of parking. 

Reception is really nice and the check-in staff could not have been more welcoming. We were given every piece of information we could posisbly need, all in the space of 10 minutes along with a full orientation of the hotel and grounds. As an added bonus, we were given a free upgrade to a Mountain View suite !!! Result ! The room was very impressive, I guess as it was a suite that's no surprise but it was huge. Wonderful space, kitchen area, living room, huge bedroom, large balcony with a view of the Sugarloaf mountain, very large bathroom with bath, rainfall shower. The bed was very comfortable and there was a tv in the bedroom and living room. The kitchen had a really good coffee machine. 

As mentioned in other reviews, the river walk is a must. It's around 7 or 8km and it's a bit hilly but nothing too bad. Really peaceful and relaxing. 

Breakfast was fantastic, buffet style with everything you could possibly think of. Again, worth mentioning the staff were excellent. 

We ate in the restaruant on our second night. Food and atmosphere was excellent. Staff were very attentive and friendly.

The spa area was great, nice pool and sauna area. We didn't have any treatments so I cant comment on this. 

So, overall, it was an incredible stay. The staff were so nice and for me that's always critical to a good stay. You should go !!!",5,2017,06,05
217,Very disappointing visit,"My 2 sisters and I went to Powerscourt for the day to celebrate my birthday. We had a voucher to use so we decided to spend it at the restaurant in Powerscourt. Thankfully we didn't waste our money on this trip. We had lunch in the Sika restaurant, talk about a disappointment. When we arrived we were asked if we had dined there before, we hadn't. I don't know if there was some information about the restaurant that we were not privy to, like I hope you're not hungry because you'll have to wait an eternity for food to put on your plate! The restaurant was dark with no atmosphere. We were seated In a small section while the rest of the restaurant was being cleared and cleaned. It took forever after ordering our food for it to arrive. i had ordered a vegetarian main but it came with Parmesan cheese on it which is not vegetarian. When I asked the waitress why it was on a vegetarian dish she told me that the chef said they only use good quality Parmesan cheese which doesn't contain rennet. Then this isn't Parmesan! Why advertise a dish as vegetarian and then put a non vegetarian cheese on top of it? We order sparkling water and when we finished the bottle, the waitress opened another bottle and poured it in our glasses. If we wanted to spend another €6 on water we would have asked for it! When I gave the waitress the voucher I was using to pay for the meal we had to wait more than 20 minutes to get the voucher back. I would absolutely not recommend this restaurant. We left Powerscourt for a few hours to discover Wicklow & returned to have dinner in McGills bar. I was spending the voucher one way or another as I had no intention of coming back to this hotel again! In he bar the waiter took our order without writing it down, it arrived and was not correct. When the waiter came back again with the order, it was still wrong. To spend the remainder of the voucher I purchased Espa products in the spa. The gentleman who served me was very friendly and helpful. The doorman was also very friendly, the rest of the staff were not. I'm glad we didn't use the voucher to stay in the hotel as judging by our experience of the hotel I think a stay there would have been equally disappointing. I can only presume he good reviews of the hotel were when the hotel was part of the Ritz Cartlon group.",2,2017,06,04
217,Best hotel experience in Ireland,"Where do i even start... I have had the good fortune of staying in a number of Ireland's best hotels but this was just the complete package. I have rarely been able to relax so fully in such a short space of time.  Due to the cost of the hotel we were only able to stay one night but I would highly recommend trying to save up for two nights as it would really add to the feeling of being removed from it all.  We were met by a wonderful front of house staff who gave us a little tour of the hotel before telling us we had been upgraded to a garden view room. We jumped around our room like little kids when we saw it.  The largest hotel room I've ever stayed in with two beautiful comfortable beds, the worlds largest walk in wardrobe and a massive bathroom with separate shower and toilet room.  We headed down to the spa for what we both agreed was the best massage we'd ever had and followed this by hours of relaxing in the jacuzzi and thermal suite.  Feeling totally blissed out we enjoyed a raucous two hours over a delicious dinner in McGills pub and finally hit the hay.  We ate out for breakfast as we just couldn't justify 30 euro per head for breakfast and following checkout I enjoyed another 3 hours in the spa before sadly heading home. Will be telling everyone I can about this place and saving up to return as soon as possible!!",5,2017,06,04
217,We were treated royally! Great location! Great memories!,"We were so impressed at the front gates!! Everything else, once we entered onto the property,  got better! We checked in a bit later then we should BUT BUT BUT, they upgraded us to a 800 (?) square foot room that overlooked the fountain area towards Sugar Loaf Mountain! What a place! We were pampered in that room and it was only because they overbooked re a wedding. Great Seimens expresso maker etc etc. We loved it. Bed was comfy and the lighting system was super cool re switching on/off etc. The entire estate including the Powerscourt Gardens is so amazing, words cant express. Also, the food was fantastic and has great views of the gardens and Sugar Loaf Mountain. All I can say was my wife and I felt very special in that room. Free bikes so we loved our Sunday am bike ride down by the river - a must! The pool and sauna/steam room ROCKED!!!!!! In conclusion, any room would be great because this is a 1st class Hotel and its in IRELAND!!!! They were really good to us there. Kudos to the entire staff. We are now back in Canada and bored to tears ;) Cheers!",5,2017,06,03
217,Expected more. ,"There are certain aspects of this hotel that are outstanding. The guest rooms are well appointed, the spa is very good, and the majority of the staff are attentive and accommodating. The shortfall is with the dining facilities. It was almost impossible to get service, unless we went to the host/hostess on multiple occasions to request help. It  appeared as though there was adequate staff but they refused to make eye contact. We also heard several other guests complaining about this issue. It was disappointing.  ",3,2017,06,02
217,Favorite Place in the World,"It's unbelievable.  
I stayed here for one night before heading to the West Coast.
First, the Powerscourt Estate is a must.  The gardens are breathtaking, but the walk itself up to the hotel is also incredible.  I kept stopping along the way and sitting in the grass, basking in gratitude (seriously!).  The hotel will give you a code to the River Walk, and it's the most peaceful, serene experience.  Every minute there is something to stop for -- a small waterfall making the most beautiful sound, a perfect piece of grass to stop and stare at tall trees, and of course, the river.  I took video after video.
Next, the spa is the best I've ever been to.  The pool has crystal lights, the room is dim, and the water appears black.  I had the entire pool to myself -- it was so quiet and peaceful.  The jacuzzi is worth the visit alone.
The rooms are beyond description.  Stately, five star elegance.  In the room I recently stayed in, I couldn't find my shower -- turns out I was looking in the wrong bathroom -- there were two!  The shower is this massive rain shower.  But the terrace -- that's worth the visit alone.  Sprawling -- the length of the room -- overlooking Sugarloaf Mountain and those beautiful tall trees.
My one criticism is the food.  I thought the dinner at Sika was seriously lacking, and the breakfast was slightly better than average.  The lunch in the lounge was just average.  I would recommend eating elsewhere -- especially for the price. I remember the food being better years ago before the hotel was bought by a different company.
My one other criticism is that it's a little hard to get to from Dublin Airport via public transportation.  You have to switch buses, and I made a mistake and it cost me two hours.  The taxi is very expensive -- more than 70.  A taxi back from the hotel to Heuston Station was 40, however.
My recommendation is to do two days if you can.  I've seen good prices lately on Booking and otherwise.  The problem is that check-in is at 4, and if you arrive later in the day you can't possibly fit in the gardens, the River Walk, the spa, eating and all of the beautiful gift shops in the Estate.",5,2017,06,01
217,Fabulous,"We've just returned from a wonderful break away in Powerscourt. The hotel is FABULOUS!! We were upgraded to a suite on arrival which really made our weekend away special. The staff were all so friendly,the food was great and the hotel grounds and gardens are stunning. It is expensive but such a wonderful treat for a special occasion. ",5,2017,06,01
217,Great hotel,"Lovely hotel; ideal for families. We had a suite and it had two queen beds & we had an additional bed put in the lounge area - fine for 4 of us. Really good size suite with additional dressing room too so a good amount of space for a family. 
Good spa pool and nice that the children can use it for certain times. 4 til 6 in afternoons.. not sure on morning times. 
Breakfast is really good. 
We ate in the restaurant here & it was very nice. Children's meals were generous and inexpensive, the main menu a bit pricey but worth it. 
Beautiful views, attentive staff and friendly. The room was beautifully decorated and comfortable.. no noise from other guests. Good value and perfect base for seeing lots of the area as you can access the main M50 motorway easily but it's way back in the gorgeous countryside with phenomenal mountain views. 
Overall, first class and up there as one of the best hotels we've stayed in. ",5,2017,05,31
217,Perfect in all respects ,Indulged in one night's stay to take advantage of the location and luxury. The estate and river walk are very close. Breakfast buffet included as a Marriott gold member was delicious served in the lounge looking at the Wicklow mountains. Spa and pool and gym all top rated. Room was very spacious. Samuel at guest relations helped us with a long list of requests. ,5,2017,05,31
217,Unbelievable Stay!,"My husband and I just returned from the Powerscourt with six of our family members and we had an amazing time. From the minute we landed in Dublin and were transported to the hotel, we knew this was going to be a magical experience. Due to my Marriott status, all of our rooms were upgraded to beautiful suites and superior rooms, which was a very nice surprise. A HUGE thank you to Robbie at the Concierge desk for spending tons of time setting up large taxis for us to have throughout our stay. 

The grounds are spectacular and the facilities are amazing--definitely check out the pool! Our room was a king bed suite, which was enormous and very well done. The buffet breakfast that was served was very good, especially for Europe--usually their breakfast is on the smaller side. Also definitely take advantage of their complimentary car service into the village of Enniskerry--try the Enniskerry Inn for dinner! 

We spent one day in Dublin and at the end, we all looked at each other and said ""thank God we're staying at the Powerscourt!!"" We will definitely return to Ireland and definitely stay at the Powerscourt again. Thank you!!",5,2017,05,30
217,Beautiful hotel; great stay,"A very beautiful hotel, with attentive, friendly and helpful staff.   After the long flight from Vancouver with an early morning arrival, we were welcomed with an early check-in and suite upgrade, thanks in part to my husband's Marriot status.    The room was beautiful with an extra comfy bed and well appointed bathroom.   We had a light lunch in the Sugar Loaf Lounge, a pub dinner at McGills and an anniversary dinner in Sitka Restaurant.   All were very good.  The complementary ""continental"" breakfast includes both hot and cold items, and was nicely presented.  The hotel offers shuttle service to the local village, if you wish a coup,e more dining options.   The DART from Bray to Dublin is a great way to get into the city for touring; and the hotel is a great base to explore the Powerscourt Gardens and Waterfaal; and Glendalough National Park and its monastic village.   We thoroughly enjoyed a comfortable and relaxing stay.",5,2017,05,29
217,Beautiful Hotel,"We stayed here as a group of 10 golfers sharing twin rooms. The room was excellent and the bathroom was something else. The bed was also very comfortable. We didn't eat in the hotel as we wanted to experience Enniskerry village however the breakfast was first class as were the staff. Brilliant setting, 5* hotel and the two golf courses were also excellent. Will return with my wife and thoroughly recommended.",5,2017,05,29
217,Very slow service,"I visited Powerscourt Hotel on Saturday the 20th of May 2017 with my sisters.  First of all without the use of a Sat Nav the hotel was a little bit difficult to find.  We parked in the underground carpark which was quite dark.  We were greeted by a very friendly doorman.  The reception area of the hotel is impressive.  We decided to eat in the Sika Restaurant.  I found the décor to be quite dark and there was very little atmosphere there.  The service was extremely slow.  There were long delays between us ordering food, being served our food, then there was a delay in our plates being cleared and us being asked if we wanted dessert.  We ordered a bottle of water and a second bottle was opened and poured for us without asking (which we were charged for).  We used a voucher to pay for our lunch and there was another long delay in that being processed.  We went for a walk around the grounds of the hotel which was quite nice.  We later that day ate in McGills pub.  The staff were friendly but got my order wrong (another delay).  Again service was slow.  We went down to see the spa and pool area which looked very impressive and relaxing.  In general I found the service to be extremely slow and the food overpriced.",3,2017,05,29
217,Total Luxury with outstanding staff,"It was our last two nights of a fantastic bus tour of Ireland.  The hotel was so beautiful that I stay back the last day just to enjoy the hotel, the architecture, food, spa and gardens.  Was not disappointed.  
The bathroom was like something I have never seen before, huge jet tub, marble sinks with TV in large mirror, just to mention a few amenities to the bathroom.  The bed was so comfortable I didn't want to leave it.  It was by far the most comfortable mattress and pillows of all the luxurious hotels we stayed at in Ireland.
The room was massive with a large sitting area and walk out to huge balcony.  
By far the most beautiful hotel and grounds we have ever stayed at in the  world.",5,2017,05,28
217,Outstanding hotel!,Amazing experience!  Beautiful hotel and grounds with a lot of attention to detail.  The spa was especially spectacular!  The high tea was delicious. Only a 10 minute walk to the Powerscourt gardens as well as some other nice spots to hike.,5,2017,05,28
217,Quality accomodation and service to match,This hotel is in a stunning location and the rooms all have views out too the garden (or much further if on a higher floor). The suites are massive and tastefully furnished. The buffet breakfast has all the usual offerings plus espresso coffee. The on site restaurant and pub gives you a couple of good options for food. I found all the staff extremely friendly and helpful.,5,2017,05,28
217,Pure luxury!,"My husband and I stayed at Powerscourt for 4 nights to celebrate my birthday. It is a gorgeous hotel, in easy reach of Dublin but set in the most beautiful countryside of the Wicklow mountains. Nothing is too much trouble for the staff who are very attentive and friendly. The bedroom was large (we had one with a view of the mountain), the bathroom almost as large and separate dressing room. The bed was the most comfortable I have ever experienced. It was like sleeping in a fluffy cloud! But not so soft that it hurt my back. The food is excellent both in the restaurant and the bar, and at breakfast. If I had to find a negative I would say the bathrobes were a bit thin and weedy, and they were not over generous with the lovely toilettries, but these are very minor quibbles. Powerscourt house, gardens and waterfall are just minutes away, as are the Wicklow mountains. Loads of hiking and biking routes and plenty of other activities at the hotel. We had a fantastic stay, fell in love with Ireland and will return very soon.",5,2017,05,25
217,GREAT PEOPLE GREAT LOCATION,Fantastic location and warm and friendly staff.  Attentive service and rooms you could play tennis in!  My husband wouldn't get out of the bath as there was a TV in the mirror! Amazing!!  Have to say a view people from the North of Ireland being rude and a bit obnoxious to staff around other guests but that's life I guess.  Had an amazing 2 day break.  Food is tasty and thank goodness not stuffy and starchy!,5,2017,05,25
217,Beautiful resort and great staff ,"It's always nerve wracking traveling with an infant but this a great staff made it seamless. The baby crib was very nice (I have seen so bad ones at other hotels) and they even have complimentary baby purée ok the room service menu. My little guy loved it! There is so much space to walk and picnic and just take in the views. I will be back. Amazing place, amazing experience.",5,2017,05,25
217,Fantastic Hotel,"Beautiful location and beautiful hotel.  Was upgraded to a suite totally unexpectedly and had a superb large balcony which enabled me to take in the scenery and superb weather over pre dinner drinks and at breakfast. 
Sika restaurant was absolutely superb and the service second to none. 
Could not recommend it highly enough.
So close to Dublin and Greystones where the Happy Pear is located is within a short drive and well worth a trip. Lovely beach and marina. 
Will definitely be back.",5,2017,05,24
217,Fantastic place we love it going for the third time,"From you go in you are looked after so well, the staff, food and gardens are stunning, rooms are beautiful and so many places to sit out, it is a great place for children, it is an excellent with children or just as a couple, this place never disappoints",5,2017,05,23
217,Arrived,"You've arrived,Wow you certainly have when you enter these doors.5 star luxury and service all the way,just as you expect!Nestled in the famous Powerscourt gardens and waterfall with the Wicklow mountains as your backdrop.the rooms are spacious and luxurious with high end toiletries.the restaurant is what you'd expect in an establishment of this calibre,the menu is extensive,fillet steak,monk fish,oysters,Wicklow lamb,Angus beef all to die for,service throughout impeccable.Public bar for night cap before you retire for the night.Espa the morning after for a pampering.Co.Wicklow the garden of Ireland,lots to explore.tell me all about it!",5,2017,05,22
217,Wonderful Hotel,"Wonderful hotel-staff if friendly, rooms are beautifully appointed and clean, and food is delicious. Beautiful area and the gardens and waterfall is not to be missed. The gardens and house are within walking distance from the hotel. Highly recommend it and look forward to returning. ",5,2017,05,22
217,Phenomenal,I recently stayed at this hotel as part of my honeymoon. The hotel is a short drive from Dublin.  The grounds and hotel are fantastic.  The rooms are very spacious. The views of the sugarloaf mountain are great.  One of my favorite hotels to date.  I would highly recommend. ,5,2017,05,22
217,"So many good points, just service a real  letdown","Just returned from two nights in Powerscourt.  

firstly the suite was excellent and everything very nice.. The food was good in both Sika and the Sugarloaf lounge. Breakfast was excellent..

The hotel is just let down by service.. what staff there are, they are lovely and trying their best..  First night one barman trying to serve in the Martini bar. long wait for drinks.. then onto  Sika restaurant  where 45 minute wait between courses . Cedric in the restaurant was a great fella and was very apologetic but clearly there were not enough staff or  proper management of what were there .  staff running around like headless chickens.. we ordered one drink that had to be brought from adjoining magills bar and had to watch is sitting on a bench for ten minutes 

Next night we deliberately avoided Silks as while food was fine, ""Fine Dining"" is wasn't. Next night same problem in the more casual lounge in lobby  , trying to get staff attention was a major mission and took away from any relaxment  of the experience. .

My wife enjoyed Spa experience and said her beautician Jin was very charming and professional 

its a great hotel but somewhere standards are slipping , or HR are just getting it wrong..  I'm not alone in this review when I read through others .. and its sad for such a beautiful property to be nearly there but let down on service.",3,2017,05,22
217,Excellent all round!,"Staff were brilliant all round and food really tasty. Like many 5 star hotels some guests around us wanted and expected the world but didn't want to pay for it! Those people more suited to other hotels as the setting here is truly beautiful and the rooms simply amazing and the service friendly and superb. A special mention to Susie in the lounge.
We will be back and we were also celebrating an anniversary!! Ensure you get a mountain view room at a little extra",5,2017,05,22
217,Not as expected,"I had heard a lot about Powerscourt Hotel's luxury and had always been a dream for me to celebrate my anniversary here with my husband. Just like the description we really found it stunning. But stay here really disapointed us in few aspects.
There was too much delay before we could check in to our room. Inspite of that we didnt get all the special requests done as per we required for anniversary celebration. And i did find it overcharged too.
Our room was certainly with a beautiful view and it was sheer luxurious experience in spa as well. 
Anniversary Dinner on other hand was really disappointing. The staff in Sika restaurant looked really not trained and it was difficult communicating with them in English as well. We had difficulty explaining the waitress what we required for starters and mains. Staff didn't look bothered at all about guests, it looked all chaotic. Only the managers looked like working and under too much pressure and training the staff as well at the same time. We had to wait too long for food and we complained to a manager 'Bhavik' to which he responded very nicely and made sure we enjoy our celebration dinner. He personally looked after us instead of his under qualified staff which was not responding to anyone.
We had to wait another 45 minutes in bar to get our drinks right. Wasted our time. Again in bar staff was lazy like restaurant or may be they are not experienced to work from 5 star. 
Service from staff was really poor. Overall had an average stay. Ofcourse, i cant give it 5 stars with inexperienced staff and poor service.",3,2017,05,21
217,One extremely disappointing stay,"I booked a 1 night stay in Powerscourt between getting married and going on honeymoon. I also booked Sika restaurant as a very special treat.

Our restaurant booking was for 8.30 and from the minute we sat down the whole experience was a complete disappointment.

Firstly, we weren't given a wine list, we had to ask for one. Then we had to ask could we order wine. We didnt order starters and our mains arrived about 30 mins after ordering. At this point we still hadn't received our wine. Again, we had to ask.

During our meal staff were all running around the place and the whole experience was chaotic. Fine dining it was not!!!

A waiter and waitress proceeded to have a full on argument at the entrance to the kitchen in full view of the restaurant. All staff seemed very frazzled with no manager taking control of the situation. The whole operation lacked leadership and delegation.

To top off our dinning experience one of your waitresses proceeded to 'whip' the napkin from our wine cooler, as we were eating, with wine still in our bottle and use it on another bottle of wine at another table. My husband had to pick up a wet bottle of wine which soaked himself and our table.

One employee really stood out to me for all the wrong reasons.. Bhavic. He was rude and obnoxious, not only to customers but also to his staff. He barked orders at staff and seemed to be the cause of alot of the chaos. He displayed a serious lack of customer service skills and came across the he didn't want to be there.

Upon checkout I made Denise (I think that's her name) aware of the chaos that unfolded the previous evening. She was so lovely and apologetic and offered us 20% off our restaurant and spa bill. (Our room had been prepaid)

You hotel is one that we've been dying to try for ages. Unfortunatly the 'Fine dinning' experience left alot to be desired. The 5* reputation and 5* prices are defiantly not representative of the service we received.

We will think long and hard before spending our money to stay in your hotel again.

I have since emailed the hotel and was offered a room upgrade on my next stay.....it goes without saying we will not be returning in the foreseeable future.",1,2017,05,19
217,Hotel and Staff are WORLD CLASS - Stunning,I travel for a living and stay in hotels all over the world and can tell you that when you combine the beauty of the hotel and area with the outstanding service from the staff; this is by far the best experience I have ever had. The hotel beauty and accommodations stand on their own.  The nearby walk through the powerscourt gardens were amazing as well.  Some will stay in Dublin and completely miss out on the beauty of Ireland. This hotel will give you it all.  An enjoyable train ride into Dublin will offer you views of the landscape as well.  McGill's pub in the hotel is amazing.  If Ross is there make sure he makes you a signature cocktail and when you visit make sure to connect with Robbie the concierge; he will guide you to seeing the country the Irish way!  The breakfast buffet is extensive - food and service is great. The hotel staff made Ireland an amazing trip.  This hotel will not disappoint.  We were so glad we didn't stay in Dublin. Cannot recommend enough.,5,2017,05,19
217,Beautiful Hotel,"We loved our stay at the beautiful Powerscourt hotel. The grounds are a treat to the eyes as you drive up to the hotel. The guestrooms are spacious and lovely to say the least, with an amazing view looking out to the garden. The staff was helpful and efficient and the concierge could not do enough for us.

The hotel is in walking distance to the Powerscourt gardens. Incredible gardens with a café and boutiques. The café has a variety of goodies with their scones being our favorite! 

I would highly recommend this gorgeous hotel, it is not far from Dublin City.",5,2017,05,18
217,Stunning!,"My partner booked this hotel as a surprise to celebrate our engagement the a couple of days before at powerscourt waterfall. Absolutely stunning hotel, rooms, spa and surroundings. The dinner in the Sika restaurant was outstanding and we were given complimentary glasses of prosecco and a dessert as a congratulations on our engagement! Breakfast was fantastic! Staff were friendly and helpful. We just wish we lived closer as we cannot wait to return in the future! Amazing hotel, would totally recommend! Thank you again :)",5,2017,05,18
217,My favourite hotel,"A wonderful hotel in a beautiful location, and the staff cannot do enough to help. 
My third stay at this lovely hotel south of Dublin and I cannot praise it enough. I'm looking forward to my next visit.",5,2017,05,17
217,Location amazing staff ok,"The property is absolutely gorgeous. Definitely worth a visit. The guest rooms are clean and spacious. The staff however does not smile, you must great them and they seem put off when you ask for things. Many staff members gave us different information. Glad I went, but would not go again. Recommend just for people to visit.",3,2017,05,17
217,Fantastic stay,"Great service, incredible room! Upgraded to suite as requested mountain view and was truly incredible!
Had a fantastic stay!
Great front desk staff, great pool. Beautiful lobby.
Would highly recommend!
The grounds, walking trail, gardens and nearby hikes are a must and the drive in to Dublin is not that long.  This was one of the most incredible hotels we have ever stayed at.  Would definitely come again.",5,2017,05,17
217,Nirvana ,I look forward to visiting this property again. Stunning location and the rooms are gorgeous. We had a TV in the mirror in our bathroom. You can relax after a long day touring in the tub and watch TV. Everyone we interacted with that worked there was so nice and wanted to make sure our stay was enjoyable.  Has a beautiful Spa and great restaurants. The grounds are stunning.  Great area to walk round. Powerscourt House and gardens are within walking distance. You can catch the train to and fro to Dublin in Bray about 15 minute drive away. ,5,2017,05,16
217,"Gorgeous place, great setting!","Powerscourt is a top-notch luxury hotel, set in an estate of over 1000 acres, with amazing gardens, golf, shopping and sightseeing.  The restaurants feature excellent food.  The rooms have the latest amenities, including electronic panels to control everything from the lights to the heat in the bathroom floor.  Enniskerry is a quaint little village and nearby shopping opportunities abound.",5,2017,05,16
217,Huge beautiful room with living room and amazing bathroom.,"We stayed here for 1 night in May 2017 and were upgraded to a huge, beautiful room (450) that overlooked the garden area.  This hotel had the best bed and pillows that we had during our 16 day trip to Ireland. This is a Marriott  Autograph Collection hotel and it is a beautiful property. The Powerscourt Gardens are nearby as well as a golf course across the main street. The room was beautiful with a built in TV in the bathroom mirror and  electronic wall controls for curtains, lights, and air conditioning. WIFI and parking is included in the room rate.  We ate dinner in the Pub downstairs.  There was a small convention going on that used the conventions rooms and facilities. There is also and indoor pool and spa that we did not use.  Drove to Dublin airport the next morning for flight back to US.",5,2017,05,16
217,Not the five star stay you might expect from Marriott Autograph Cpollection,"I have stayed at this hotel on two separate occasions for two nights on each occasion.  My first stay in July 2015 was with friends and on my most recent stay, in May this year, my wife and I were entertaining guests.

Powerscourt Hotel is a fine hotel located in the most beautiful location and it cannot be faulted for it's amenities, i.e. bars, restaurant, spa, fitness room etc.  I dined in the Sika  restaurant on both occasions and the food was excellent.  The breakfasts cater for all tastes and are substantial.  The Classic suites in which I stayed on both occasions are lovely.  The beds were comfortable and the suites were bright and roomy and have all the facilities you would expect.  However the whole experience on each occasion have been marred by staffing issues which, in a five star Marriott Autograph Collection Hotel should not occur.

On my first visit, 12 to 14 July 2015, we arrived at the hotel after a four hour drive.  When we arrived the hotel was in complete disarray, it being quite obvious that many rooms were not ready to be occupied.  There were many guests sitting about waiting for their rooms.  When I eventually got to check in, after quite a wait, I was told that it would be a while before our rooms would be ready and no time could be given for when that would be.  I pointed out that I had a dinner reservation in the Sika restaurant, that we had been driving for  four hours and we would like the opportunity to freshen up and change clothes before dining.  The male receptionist's response was to say that the hotel's check in policy was four PM, to which I informed him that what he had said was the most stupidest thing, as the time now was four thirty PM.  In any event the hotel provided complimentary tea and coffee, and our wives had a complimentary glass of wine while we waited.  When we did eventually get our suites some time later, I arrived in our suite to find that there was no luggage present.  I rang my friend in his suite and found that all the luggage had been deposited with him.  I rang reception to have my luggage retrieved and delivered to my room, but after waiting twenty minutes I went and retrieved it myself, time was marching on.  After that things went well until I was checking out.  Upon checking out I checked my bill and found that a bottle of Port wine had been added to my room.  Neither I nor my friends had a bottle of Port, so I had to argue this point with the receptionist to have it removed from my bill.  It's the small thing's that matter as I tend to wonder how a mistake like that could occur.

Anyway I was not put off Powerscourt as I stayed most recently from 31 May to 02 April.  As I said I was entertaining guests on this occasion, which was important to my wife and I.  When we arrived, again after a long drive, the M50 on a Friday evening was simply a car park for most of it.  We were able to check in right away which was good.  However the male receptionist stated that we had a table in the Sika restaurant booked for that evening.  I informed him that was incorrect, I had a table booked for Saturday evening.  After some discussion I pointed out to him that I could and would show him the confirmation email from the restaurant that confirms my booking for Saturday night, he said he would sort it out.

Due to the longer than expected drive and the lateness of the hour we all decided to dine in McGills Bar in the hotel and have a few drinks there rather than going out.  So we had our meal and some drinks.  When I ordered our last round of drinks I requested the barmaid also bring my bill so I could charge it to my room, which she subsequently did.  I checked the bill which was quite substantial, found it correct and I duly signed it, entered my suite number and placed a cash gratuity in the wallet and handed it back to the same barmaid.  When we finished our drinks and were leaving,  I was passing the bar and a barman or bar manager, I don't know what his status was, asked me if I had settled my bill.  I confirmed to him that I had settled the bill.  We then left the bar.  We were barely outside into the corridor where there were many people about as there was a wedding function on in a function room further along the corridor, when the same barman/bar manager accosted me in the presence of both my guests and other people saying ""Excuse me sir you have not settled your bill"" while waving an account wallet at me.  I assured him once again that I had, and my guests also assured him that I had.  He then went on to say that I had no credit card on account and I informed him that I most certainly had, that my credit card had been authorised when I checked in.  I informed him exactly the amount of my bill, that I had charged it to my room, I gave him my suite number and informed him that I had placed a cash gratuity inside the wallet before returning it to the barmaid, which I was now starting to regret.  At that a light bulb seemed to illuminate in his brain and he replied ""Ah, I think I know what the problem is"" and without any further ado turned on his heel and walked off back to the bar without as much as an explanation for his conduct or and apology for the way in which he had accosted me in front of my guests and others in the corridor.

The next morning after breakfast I spoke with the duty manager, Robbie Smyth and made a complaint about the way in which I had been treated by the barman the previous evening, that he had caused me significant embarrassment in front of my guests and other hotel guests and treated me like a common thief trying to leave the bar without settling my bill, especially as I had already confirmed with him I had settled the bill, as I was leaving the bar.  I also pointed out to Mr Smyth that this was my second occasion staying at Powerscourt and informed him of the events of my first stay also.  I pointed out that so far my impression of the hotel was lukewarm at most.  Mr Smyth apologized and said he would deal with the matter and appeared most genuine.  I had also informed him of the debacle the previous evening over the booking for dinner in the Sika restaurant, so he was then aware that we were dining that evening in the restaurant.  Mr Smyth stated that as a gesture of apology he would have a bottle of champagne set on our table for dinner.  He would also had some chocolates sent to my guests suite and some macaroons sent to our suite for my wife, as I informed him that she could not eat the chocolates as she has coeliacs disease.  I left happy that Mr Smyth would deal with the matter.

Later that evening we went to the Sika restaurant for our meal.  After we had been seated the waiter came to our table and said that there was a complimentary bottle of Cava for our table.  I pointed out to him that it should be a complimentary bottle of Champagne and not Cava, that the Manager Mr Smyth had clearly stated champagne.  He said he would have to speak to his manager and off he went.  The waiter returned shortly with a bottle of champagne offering apologies.  Once again in a crowded restaurant in the hearing of other diners a discussion had to take place with a member of staff about what was said and what was offered by a manager.  It actually made me feel that they were trying to pass off a bottle of Cava on me as if I would not know the difference between Cava and Champagne, not that I have anything against Cava, there are some very fine ones around.  

We checked out next morning without any further ado.  When I got home I received a standard email from Marriott requesting me to complete an online survey on my experience at their Powerscourt Autograph Collection hotel.  I deleted it thinking I had made my complaints known to the manager, Robbie Smyth, and hopefully he had dealt with them, he had been gracious and had provided some recompense albeit there had been an issue with that, and there was no point going over it again.  However some days later I received another email from Marriott stating that they would still like to hear from me about my experience.  Well I thought if they are so keen to hear from me I will complete their survey and did so outlining what I have said in this review.  I asked them that if they are so keen that I take time to complete their survey then I would be obliged if someone would take time to respond to it.  I didn't really expect a response but to my surprise three days later I received a response from Mr Brian Nixon, Guest Relations Executive, Powerscourt Hotel and Spa.  The text being as follows:
 
Mr Mxxxxxxx, I would firstly like to apologize for a clear and obvious litany of errors and I can imagine the opinion that you have of how we do business at this moment in time. It is also clear that what stands out is a lack of professionalism and a number of very basic failings and all of a similar nature. I can assure you that we will be running refresher training on a number of service procedures in light of your experience.

It was even more disappointing to read that when you had taken the time to bring the issue at McGills to our attention we again failed to effectively resolve the situation and I can understand your frustration at Sika that evening. 

I would love the opportunity to show you the true Powerscourt experience and if you were in a position to consider a return visit to Enniskerry I would be delighted to send a voucher to include a 20% discount along with a complimentary upgrade to one of our suites for your next stay, as a means of both an apology for a most underwhelming stay and to allow us the opportunity to show you what we can truly achieve here at Powerscourt.

Mr Mxxxxxxxx, I would like to sincerely apologize once again for the service failings that you have experienced with us and I do understand that this was further exacerbated by the fact that you had chosen our property to entertain guests and I truly hope that we will have the opportunity to redeem ourselves in the near future.

Warmest regards,

Brian Nixon

Once again a gracious offer of recompense.  I replied to Mr Nixon and in my reply I accepted his kind offer, as I do really enjoy staying at Powerscourt Hotel despite the failings I have encountered.  I had all but given up on hearing anything further from Mr Nixon when on 30 April, 16 days after I responded to him,  I received an email which reads as follows:

Good Afternoon Mr Mxxxxxxxx,

I would firstly like to thank you for your email and to apologize for my delayed response, I have been away from the hotel unexpectedly for the past number of days.

Mr Mxxxxxxxx I am delighted to hear that you would be interested in returning to Powerscourt and I will certainly forward a voucher on Tuesday.

I would like to thank you once again for your understanding and time and I look forward to welcoming you back to Powerscourt later this year.

If I can be of any further assistance in the meantime, please do let me know.

Kind regards,

Brian Nixon
Guest Relations Executive
Powerscourt Hotel Resort and Spa

Well here I sit on Tuesday, two weeks since Mr Nixon assured me he would send the voucher and no voucher has arrived either electronically by email, or by post.

What can I say?  Powerscourt Hotel is a five star establishment charging for a five star experience.  However the whole experience is marred by all these staff issues which are clearly not confined to persons working at front of house, face to face level, i.e receptionists, waiters and bar staff.  It clearly seems to me that they also extend to to executive level.  If that is the case then can these issues ever be resolved?

I have stayed many times at the five star Merrion Hotel, Merrion Square, Dublin and am looking forward to staying there again in July.  Never during all of my stays there have I encountered anything like that which I have encountered at the Powerscourt Hotel.  The Merrion is truly a five star experience.",2,2017,05,16
217,Calm Splendour in a Scenic Location,"I recently checked into the Powerscourt on business (again) and it is still a wonderfully calm place to relax in the hotel’s splendour and surrounding Co Wicklow scenery. I don’t play golf and I didn’t have time for the spa, but I know that both are equally splendid.

One small tip: if you are arriving after the ‘big house’ has closed, you need to press the ‘Golf’ button in order to get the gates opened. (It is poorly signed.)",5,2017,05,16
217,Good every time,"Escaped for a short kid-free break, and it was bliss. The location is gorgeous, and we were given a beautiful mountain view suite on the fourth floor with amazing views. Food (lunch in the lounge and dinner in the restaurant) was lovely. Spa is also beautiful- the downstairs area was noisy with a big group using the facilities, but the upstairs relaxation room and thermal suite was wonderfully quiet and relaxing. Looking forward to next stay already.",5,2017,05,16
217,Spa weekend!,"Without doubt the best spa I've been to in Ireland! All facilities look over the sugar loaf  mountain, amazing views, and the treatments was perfect. Would 100% recommend the spa. Only had breakfast in the hotel which was average, but the spa excellent ",5,2017,05,15
217,Beautiful Hotel,"Beautiful spacious rooms & such a stunning setting.
Good conference facility.
David the doorman was so lovely.
Delicious breakfast, lunch & dinner.
Called front desk a few times & constantly ringing out - not sure where the my all were!!",5,2017,05,14
217,Corporate idea of good customer service ,"Stayed last Saturday night with my mother who has to use a wheelchair in the Powerscourt Hotel and would strongly advise anyone using there disabled room to check it out first.

The bed was not suitable for disabled use being too high and too soft. There was no bed side cabinet on the side of the bed that she has to sleep on due to her disability.

Reception answer was to send up a sort of small suitcase filled with reams of paper to act as a step. The result was that when my mother with my help had to use the bathroom at 5.00am (approx) she could not get back into the bed and ended up sleeping on the chair. 

Luckily  I was able to book us in a night early (Cliff House Hotel) and we escaped this money grabbing establishment. The email I received re situation was the typical corporate waffle.

Just as an additional warning not all mountain view rooms which cost extra have a mountain view and at breakfast we had 3 small pots of honey/marmalade of which 2 were opened and half used.

",1,2017,05,13
217,A little bit of luxury,"I stayed here for 1 night. My room was on the 6th floor. Huge room with a sitting area and balcony
Very clean and comfortable
Staff were excellent - very helpful. Spa was very nice - particularly the serenity room.
I ate dinner in Sika - it was nice but not fabulous. Breakfast was buffet style - a very good buffet but still a buffet which was probably my only real concern - I wanted a tranquil morning with freshly cooked breakfast. Sadly the buffet meant it was quite hectic with children running around
However, beautiful surroundings and really classy interiors make this a lovely hotel for a getaway.",5,2017,05,12
217,Beautiful setting,"A lovely hotel in a beautiful setting, I was disappointed as I was working I couldn't enjoy the local walks. The hotel is well presented, professional staff. The service is efficient and friendly. Every touch point with the staff was professional and friendly. ",5,2017,05,12
217,I Will Never Visit this Place!,"An unfortunate series of events led to my cancelling with advanced notice a reservation at this so called Marriott property, only to learn that they unfairly charged my cc USD266. The good news is that I ended up staying at a true Irish gem: The Shelbourne Hotel in Dublin.
Bottom line: Powerscourt's hunger for revenue deserves a thumb down and Shelbourne's impeccable service deserves a thumb up.",1,2017,05,11
217,Poor food hygiene practices....,"Fruit flies on apples in spa area, open uncovered  dried fruit and nut offerings and stagnant tea served from tea dispensers.... 5 star ??? I think not and management seemed more interested in themselves than customer ... Not a 5 star food hygiene practice at all...",1,2017,05,09
217,Absolutely gorgeous hotel,"Pros: 
1. Very spacious, clean and modern rooms.
2. Staff are ok.
3. Food was delicious.
4. Plenty of well organised conference rooms
5. Amazing surroundings (including the Enniskerry village)
6. You could see quality in everything!",5,2017,05,09
217,"Fantastic stay, a genuine 5 star",We stayed in Powerscourt for a wedding last week and all I can say is wow. It is stunning in every sense of the word. The rooms are spacious and decor is classic. Bed was super comfy. My partner mislaid his wallet and we only realized when we got home. Derek who works I assume works on reception could not have been more helpful and went out of his way to find the wallet. It was much appreciated we will def be back again.Well worth a visit and good value for money.,5,2017,05,04
217,Gorgeous hotel but poor service lets it down,"My husband and I stayed here on the Thursday of Easter weekend. We were both very impressed with our bedroom, gorgeous decor, comfy bed and beautiful bathroom. However, when we went downstairs for a drink we were disappointed in how long it took to get two drinks - we had to wait quite a while after we ordered for a cup of tea and a glass of prosecco. We had dinner booked for 8:15pm in the restaurant, however, when we arrived at 8:10pm we were told to go upstairs to the bar for a drink. Again, the service was very slow, my husband had to go and ask a waiter to serve us and it took 15 minutes for them to return with our drinks order (no fancy cocktails that take ages, just a beer and a glass of white). At this stage the bar upstairs was relatively quiet so was shocked it took as long. After waiting 25 minutes my husband went and asked someone when our table in the restaurant would be ready so the waiter said he'd go check. Another 10 minutes and someone from the restaurant arrived and told us our table was ready. There was no apology or reason as to why were left until 8:45pm to be seated, I genuinely think we were forgotten about as the restaurant wasn't full at 8:10pm nor at 8:45pm. The hotel in itself is fabulous, as are the grounds but I felt the poor and slow service let it down.",3,2017,05,02
217,Shocking.Utter dismay,"Went out here today with my wife and friend of ours. We were scouting out the place, as it were, as friends are coming from the US and would like to stay here.
We were greeted at the door by the very convivial doorman and all augured well.
We were planning on having afternoon tea but upon inquiry were directed downstairs as they couldn't accommodate us on the ground floor. One presumed because they were busy but they didn't appear overly so.
We went downstairs and out onto a viewing veranda  and it being a beautiful day, everything looked lovely. After some time, when no staff came to attend us,I went  back inside and there were two staff leisurely setting tables. I asked for assistance and someone eventually came out to us. On the way back to my seat I had noticed that one of the tables near us  had very full cigarette ashtray which was both surprising and off putting.
When a staff member came to us he advised that we couldn't be served by him and that we would 'have to go to the bar' to be served. He gave us directions.. I asked could he not serve us and he had to go off and check. Eventually he came back and said that he could serve us coffee but not food. As this was taking place a maid came with a tray full of drinks and served others.but, seemingly, wouldn't be available to serve us. For that to happen we would have to go to the bar and presumably they would then bring the drinks out to us..
That was ridiculous. On the way out we met two management looking types, one of whom had directed us to go downstairs to be served in the first place, and when I articulated my  disappointment at the service they just turned away from us and continued talking to each other.
Appalling!",1,2017,05,01
217,Hard to figure out???????,"How can a chef and his team serve up over 150 perfectly cooked large size fillet steaks, I genuinely don't think I have enjoyed a fillet steak like it and certainly at a wedding. 
Stayed 2 nights and from the initial welcoming smile from a very kind concierge out side to him telling us safe journey on our way home i cannot fault this place. Mcgills has amazing chowder and creamy pints of guinness, spa is very spacious and clean with a large pool. 
Great wedding venue with some fantastic views. 
One regret I didn't pack the golf clubs but won't make that mistake when I return soon.
Good job team you have a lovely hotel.",5,2017,05,01
217,Wow!! What a Grand Hotel!,"I was here for a conference and got upgraded to a suite. And what a suite it was! Full living room, full dining room, half bath, bedroom, dressing room, and huge main bathroom with big tub, double sinks, a separate shower, and views to die for out every window. Decoration was classic (crown moldings) but not too ostentatious. I ordered room service a couple of times and it was above average. Service was great despite their being two events on during my stay. The grounds looked lovely, though I didn't have time for a walk. Would definitely recommend it!",5,2017,04,30
217,Outstanding service,"Staff were amazing. Loved the live bunny pen in lobby for Easter. Room was elegant and spacious. Food was tasty. 

But........... for a hotel of this status in our room the wall paper corners were peeling, shower showed signs of mold and hard wood floors were very scratched. 

Would stay again ",4,2017,04,29
217,Words can't begin to explain how wonderful everything in this hotel is!,"Not a single complain, even if I tried to come up with something. So spacious, lovely big rooms, amazing, peaceful area, lots of green, views with mountains, lovely place to walk around, amazing staff, the spa... Wow, just wow. Lovely steam room, sauna and pool. Restaurant has a great menu and there are more of them and bars. My visit was in December, fab time to go as it was all decorated and the atmosphere was so lovely. Please.... VISIT!",5,2017,04,29
217,Birthday Weekend ,"I cannot rate this Hotel highly enough-i hesitate to do that because I would like to keep it All to myself .I had my birthday weekend here had a fabulous suite with whirlpool after check in the girls and I were having a drink in the room and a lady delivered some birthday chocholates-what a nice little touch.the other ladies rooms were exactly as I had asked them to be.we had exquisite treatments in the spa and a superb dinner in Sika.the only thing is breakfast gets very busy I think they need to stagger it or encourage room service which we probably should have done.
I checked out online as the check out queues are lengthy. 
I love this place I can breath here",5,2017,04,26
217,Wow!,"Powerscourt Hotel is undoubtedly one of the most incredible hotels in Europe. It's difficult to know where to start - luxurious guest rooms, stunning views, incredible spa and Leisure facilities, amazing food and wonderful staff. 
This was our second visit to Powerscourt and it didn't disappoint. 
Congrats to all the team on this spectacular property - a genuine 5* resort. ",5,2017,04,25
217,A Grand Classic in One of the Most Beautiful Spots on Earth,"Powerscourt in Enniskerry County Wicklow Ireland, is an unexpected grand semi-circular Greco-Roman style building, set in one of the most beautiful spots on earth.  I lived in County Wicklow for two years in my early 20's, so this was a welcome homecoming for me.  There is a feeling of peace about the place, even with the many families who were staying there over Easter break.  The service is excellent - everyone was always willing to provide special accommodations.  Our room was a suite with windows looking towards the Wicklow Mountains, one of the most lavish rooms I've ever stayed in.  The swiimming pool all done in black tile, and strangely enough this has a calming effect. Every detail of the interiors is beautifully designed and classic, to match the exterior.  The colors are ranges of soft blues and golds.  The whole effect is a great feeling of natural space.",5,2017,04,25
217,so close to Dublin but you feel so far away,The Powerscourt Hotel is located just a short 30 or so minutes from the Dublin airport but it is in a cute village called Enniskerry.  The hotel is stunning with beautiful rooms that have amazing views of the Wicklow mountains.  Tea is served in the beautiful lobby.  Outside the property is The old home which is now a bustling group of lovely shops and beautiful gardens.  The golf course is beautiful as well.  You can spend days here and not do it all.  The spa is wonderful and very busy so book ahead.  The breakfast is AMAZING!,5,2017,04,25
217,"Nice hotel, good service, great views","Spent one night at this former Ritz Carlton Hotel. The location is pretty spectacular. I was upgraded to a larger room upon checking in. It was described as a garden room but all i could see was the road/car park, so that wasn't so pretty. When booking try to secure a room with a view towards Sugarloaf mountain - in that way you will be on the correct side of the hotel. The room decor was a bit on the heavy side and not to my liking, but the room itself was large, comprising several rooms - virtually the size of an apartment. When I arrived in my room it was chilly, set at 19 degrees which wasn't a great start to my stay. No one explained that the a/c control is a touchscreen panel in each of the rooms - took a while to figure that one out.",4,2017,04,25
217,Couples ,Amazing night from start to finish. Check in was at 4pm it would be better if you could check in around 2pm. Anyway staff are amazing and accommodating im sure this is all with the price tag. Amazing cocktails at McGills pub. We dined in sika restaurant that evening. The venison is phenomenal.  Breakfast was amazing with lots to choose from definitely recommend for a romantic getaway. ,5,2017,04,22
217,Another fabulous stay.,"Just returned from a 2 day stay, second time here and will be back. 
We ate in Enniskerry at Emilia's on the first night which was lovely. 
Had a meal at hotel on second which was also excellent. Staff so friendly and helpful. Had a Spa treatment which was heaven, the Espa Spa is a little peace of heaven. 
One small gripe- we were wakened very early by a lovely lad with our morning paper asking if we wanted our room serviced- my husband was still snoring so I said no!! But I do appreciate it's a very large hotel and they have to start somewhere! 
Thank you for a great stay.",5,2017,04,21
217,Unauthorised deduction ,"Well, it's my second time to stay in this hotel. Before you check in they scanned your credit card. I didn't understand why as not so many hotels doing  like that. I've paid for one night, there was no problem but week later someone was made unauthorise payment from my account. I decided made phone call to hear what's going on as I didn't gave Powerscourt authorisation to use my account whatever they feel......One lady was following my reservations and there is noting in their record...Very strange . It's mean any person can play with your account there . Before you decided let receptionist scan your credit card think twice. It was my second and last time staying there.",1,2017,04,20
217,Amazinh,"This hotel is absolutely beautiful. We paid a little extra and got a mountain view room and it was easily one of the best hotel rooms I've ever stayed in. Very luxurious and would definitely recommend staying here for a special treat. Unfortunately the spa was fully booked during our stay so I'd recommend advance booking. Also get the Marriott hotels app it's so good if you need something brought to your room you can just type it in the app and it will appear! You can also request an earlier check in, they'll try to accommodate where possible.",5,2017,04,19
217,Not the standard I expected unfortunately ,"We booked a triple room to celebrate my mother's birthday. I was told on booking that there would be two double beds in the room, which sounded perfect. The reality was a large room, with two small double beds which resulted in a very uncomfortable nights sleep for my sister and I who shared one of the beds - far too small for two people.
The room itself was large and clean, with complementary chocolates for my mother's birthday which was a nice touch, but did not make up for the disappointing bed situation.

We initially were planning on dining in the Sugar Loaf lounge that evening but found the menu very limited. Instead we dined in the restaurant, where there was a few more options and the food and service was excellent. Following the meal, we hoped to have a drink in the lounge, however we were told there were no available tables, so we sat in the lobby. After approximately 40 minutes, I had to approach the lounge staff to order some drinks as no one had come near us.

The next morning, we had breakfast in the Sugar Loaf lounge. A beautiful setting but a buffet breakfast. Good variety of pastries, fruit etc but the cooked items looked and tasted like they had sat in the bain marie all morning, the porridge very stodgy. For a hotel of this standard, I would have expected the hot items to be at least cooked to order.

All in all, the high room rate would have been justified if the experience had been what I expected. Unfortunately it was not and I will not be returning.",3,2017,04,18
217,Exceptional.,"We greatly enjoyed our recent stay at Powerscourt and wished we could have stayed more than one night. We received exceptional service from each member of the staff that we dealt with. As gold memebers, we were upgraded to a beautiful suite and offered complimentary breakfast, without having to ask. Our room was meticulously clean and the bed very comfortable.  All areas of the hotel were beautifully maintained. The buffet brunch was delicious and we had a very nice meal in the McGillis Pub the night of our arrival. The location, just a short ride out of Dublin, made it an ideal spot to stop on the first day of our driving trip through Ireland - just long enough to practice driving on the other side of the road after a full night of travel. We took the short walk over to the Powerscourt Estate and Gardens. Would definitely stay again!",5,2017,04,16
217,"Great stay, ideal for families ","We recently stayed in the Powerscourt and had a wonderful little break with 3 small kids. Staff were friendly and courteous, I would like to thank Amy from reservations for making booking easy and stress free.
We were upgraded to a mountain view suite and the view was magnificent. So much to do to keep kids entertained; walking trails great for bikes and scooters, the swimming pool, the onsite playground and treats in Avoca. Thanks for a lovely stay, we will certainly be back. ",5,2017,04,16
217,Lovely as always,"Stayed in powerscourt hotel over the easter weekend. Everything was really lovely. Staff friendly from check in to check out, mcgills, sugarloaf lounge and sika. My only complaint is that it was so warm in sika for breakfast and dinner. I asked at dinner if we could have more cold air but was made to feel that i was an inconvenience to others. All weekend we felt claustrophobic as no dining areas have windows except the smoking area in mcgills and our bedroom on the ground floor had floor to ceiling glass but no 
window/ door to outside. On the plus side we had 3 walks in one day for fresh air which is well needed to burn off all that lovely food!",5,2017,04,15
217,Relaxation at its finest,"The rooms, beds and surroundings are top notch.  Breakfast in the morning was incredible, which we are still referencing weeks later.  You are pretty isolated at this hotel and on your own.  The lack of a dedicated concierge made planning activities somewhat daunting.  They provided no transportation to the neighboring Powerscourt Gardens or waterfall, so you either walk or drive yourself..  That seemed odd since they are in close proximity and the walks to both involved changes in elevation.  A printed map and schedule to the nearby town of Bray to get the commuter train into Dublin would have been helpful.  We could have stayed in our room forever.  Located on the 6th floor overlooking the Sugarloaf Mountain was worth booking that category of room.  We actually had the sun shining for a day and it was a gift beyond compare. Since the restaurants are your only choice without driving off property, they are a bit overpriced and not to the standards when it was a Ritz; especially off the lobby.  The Pub isn't too bad unless a group of meeting attendees converge and then you get no service and are pretty much ignored.",4,2017,04,14
217,"Amazing Accomodations, Grounds, and Staff","American family of two adults and two 8yo stayed a week in a Superior Suite with Double beds. Charming rooms with soft beds. Amazing bathrooms!! Lovely seating area for winding down. Had views of the side garden but directly across from the reception space where a wedding reception was held one night which was unpleasant due to drunken fools making noise. But it was one night, and it was a special occasion, so we soldiered through. Excellent pub with lively entertainment, proper food, and good service. Lovely outdoor space for roaming and playing for families. Lovely walk to town, golf, and Powerscourt House. Nice gym downstairs. Staff provided directions for everything you could ever need.",5,2017,04,13
217,Extraordinary property ,We had a fabulous recent stay at the Powerscourt Hotel.  The rooms were well appointed and we had a lovely view of sugarloaf mountain.  Staff upon check in and check out were professional and efficient.  We tried two of on site restaurants and food was great and service decent.  One night was perfect for our group.   ,5,2017,04,12
217,Best Nights Sleep,"Never wanted to leave, the most comfortable beds I have stayed in. The room was spacious and luxurious. Breakfast was delicious and the Spa was such a treat! Would definitely return and I can't wait until I next have an excuse to stay again. ",5,2017,04,12
217,Most enjoyable,"A very enjoyable experience overall during this two night break. Service was excellent throughout, food was very nice, the room, the spa, the grounds, the staff.... all very good indeed, and even the weather obliged. I look forward to enjoying the many delights of this hotel again in the future, and hopefully you will too. By then, perhaps the restaurant will have reconsidered the merits of charging customers for a piece of bread with dinner......",4,2017,04,10
217,Just Beautiful and Peaceful!,"Just an absolutely wonderful stay.  We are Marriott Rewards Gold members and were definitely treated as such.  We used points for our stay and were given an upgraded room and chocolates upon arrival.  The front desk associate that greeted us, Connor(?), was extremely polite and friendly and took the time to go through all the relevant information we would need for our stay. The building and grounds were immaculate, the parking was sufficient and the restaurant options were great.  Our room was gorgeous and also immaculately clean.  We only ate breakfast at the hotel, but we did enjoy having a few drinks at the Pub on site both evenings.  The breakfast buffet was extensive and delicious.  Every staff member we encountered were polite and more than helpful if we needed.  We would definitely recommend this hotel for those looking to get away from the hustle of Dublin for some peace and serenity without being too far away.",5,2017,04,10
217,Excellent ,Hosted a corporate event here last week. We were 40 in the hotel for a week and it was excellent. Beautiful bedrooms and great food all week. Our conference room was always taken care of - everything arrived at the right time. Thank you. ,5,2017,04,08
217,Breakfast disappointing ,Stayed  here last night  in a wonderful room on check in I was told our breakfast wasn't included so if I wanted to order breakfast in bed I could only order off the right side of the menu .it was a very limited choice so we opted for the three egg omelette which was Luke warm when it arrived and cost €19 .i don't know how any hotel can justify charging that much for a basic omelette.we also ate in the bar for dinner which was lovely overall we had a wonderful stay and would love to return but breakfast was a big let down .,4,2017,04,08
217,Luxury birthday suprise,"My lovely husband booked this beautiful hotel as a surprise for my birthday in July 2016 as he knows how much love it. I actually thought I had already submitted this review so apologies for taking so long. We entered our beautiful room to find a tray decorated with fruit, chocs, water and a birthday card and its these little touches that really add to the feeling that guests are valued when they stay here. We were here to relax so went straight to the amazing leisure area with its gorgeous pool which is  decorated with sparkling Swarovski crystals lights and also has steam and sauna rooms . We ate in the Irish bar that is part of the hotel and had very nice steaks. Our room was large and comfortable and the bathroom is just amazing with everything you need. We enjoyed amazing views of the Sugar loaf mountains while eating our delicious breakfast and managed to fit in a last visit to the relaxing leisure area before checking out. Even a one night stay in Powerscourt Hotel is enough to leave you feeling that you have have experienced something special. My favourite hotel.",5,2017,04,07
217,Almost but not quite ,"Staying with you on a dark and rainy night it was a relief to find you.
Once inside the staff could not have been more helpful (even parking my car that I left at the front door)
The team looking after the room I was using for a function were a delight and went the extra mile to me when needed
We had a private dinner for about 50 guests and the food was absolutely first class.

Relaxing the morning after with coffee and fantastic views of the Wicklow mountains was a treat as were the attentive team you have 
However utilising your fast check out service I received by email an invoice for my room to my credit card (taken only for incidentals ) 
The bill was to have been settled as agreed by the company 
Despite two emails trying to correct ... no reply.

A very enjoyable stay but a little tainted.

",4,2017,04,06
217,Such a lovely place for a stroll and afternoon tea,My friends introduced me to this place as t was just 10 minutes away from my house and I never been. It was so lovely with the nice weather to take a stroll around the estate. Would definitely recommend it for afternoon tea on a lovely sunny day.,5,2017,04,05
217,Not 5 star," The place looks lovely. Nice buildings grand views. Clean luxury rooms and great wifi. 
   By no means is it a 5 star hotel. 3.5 to 4 at best.
The only things that are 5 star are the prices. 
  The restaurant is a stand out for being below 5 star. 2 hour 15 mins is rediculas for a 2 course meal. 
  The swimming pool was a horror scene. Wet towels left around and the white fungus on the pool chair legs is a huge health hazard.
  Most of the cleaning staff and general workers were great and more then helpful. Our door card did not consistently work and if there was a cleaner nearby they would help us in after making sure we were entitled to enter the room.
  Front desk staff were helpful but heartless. My pregnant wife was not at all well and they would not let her into our room and left her in the foyer crying for everyone to see. We had arrived seperatly and i checked in before my wife Apparently its hotel policy to not let my wife know the room number i had checked into or take her to our room. No effort was made to even ring my room to see if i could come down to console her. 
  So to sum up having a good location and a great building does not make a hotel 5 stars. I think it needs to be rated again. 
  Have a long think about spending your money here and think about what you want from your stay before booking.",3,2017,04,03
217,Disappointed,"Myself and my sisters recently treated our Mother to a night in Powerscourt Hotel.I had heard rave reviews and had attended a wedding there a year ago so was expecting great things.The hotel is in the most beautiful surrondings and really does have a lot to offer its guests fabulous spa,bike hire gorgeous walks etc.Extremly pricey but its a 5 star hotel so thats to be expected.However the four of us were extremly disapoinnted in the meal at the Sika restaurant that night to the point that we went back to our rooms hungry after an inedible starter,tiny main and badly thought out desert.Even the overpriced crisps in the room were gone off.Iam not a stranger to fine dining so really was looking forward to our meal but all 4 of us were left disapointed and hungry.I hope this is not the norm as it is a beautiful hotel in other aspects.",3,2017,04,02
217,Beauty and luxury at the Powerscourt in Ireland ,"This review is delayed but essential. We had an incredible experience at the Powerscourt Hotel back in August. We are a family of three, including a 22 month old, with Marriott platinum status. This autograph collection hotel provided wonderful acknowledgement of this and put us in a beautifully upgraded room. We had a bedroom, large living room, and enormous dressing room/closet. The staff were incredibly kind and responsive to our every need. 

The hotel is posh and luxurious, but they treated our toddler son so well! The pub is fun and delicious. The daily breakfast was amazing- sprawling buffet with everything you could want. The pool had family hours, which was a lot of fun. The grounds are incredibly beautiful, and don't miss the playground in the back. 

The hotel is located in charming Eniskerry. You can take a hilly walk into town or take advantage of the free luxury car service. You can drive into Dublin to enjoy a different change of pace. And the golf is challenging and beautiful. 

This was an incredibly memorable experience, and we are so grateful for the Powerscourt Hotel for making our vacation so wonderful. ",5,2017,04,01
217,Luxurious stay,"We stayed here for 2 nights after our wedding be we were really looked after. We had a gorgeous suite for the two nights - so spacious and a great view of the Sugarloaf.!Dinner in the Sika restaurant both nights was delicious and the spa.....the highlight!! 

Definitely coming back!",5,2017,04,01
217,Conference/Family Visit,"The Powerscourt Hotel is a beautiful property with spectacular grounds and lovely rooms.  It's a great place to stay for a night or two if you plan to visit the Powerscourt Gardens or the Wicklow Mountains National Park.  Our challenge with the property was getting around without a car.  Though we had a car, driving at night through the narrow winding roads or driving into Dublin were not advisable (especially if you're not used to driving on the right side of the car, and the fact that drinking even a pint of beer can put you over their very strict drunk driving laws).  Dining off property can be challenging as you would need to take a taxi about 15 minutes into towns like Bray for dinner, then arrange for a taxi to return for pick-up.  If you go into Dublin you'd need to taxi to and from the train station in Bray or take a taxi straight into Dublin.  Taking the taxi into Dublin is really more cost effective if you have 3 or more people in your group.  But getting a taxi back can be a challenge, and navigating the train was a bit hectic - no one around for assistance in purchasing tickets or to find the right platform.  Though it's not a big station, I think it's just the first experience that can be challenging.  It's about a 30 minute ride into Bray, and it can be very crowded - we had to stand the entire way.  Then catch a taxi from Bray back to Powerscourt.  Kind of a long commute to use both train and taxi.  I think it would be very helpful if the hotel could offer a couple regular shuttles to and from downtown Dublin and nearby towns like Bray for their guests.  Concierge was very helpful!  Taxi drivers were amazing, as well, and very interesting to talk to about Ireland.",4,2017,03,31
217,Very enjoyable weekend,We celebrated our 15th wedding anniversary here. The hotel is a short drive from our home but it feels like you are in the mountains. Fabulous setting. Food in main restaurant very good but same menu both nights. Spa was very nice as was the pool area. Both bars were good and we visited bray one evening for a few drinks in the harbour bar which is a short taxi away. Would recommend.,5,2017,03,30
217,Grand expedition,"We enjoyed a wonderful day in Powerscourt, culminating with dinner in the Sika room.

The hotel is luxurious and the grounds are extensive, tranquil and lovely for a relaxing stroll before dinner. The gardens are festooned with numerous attractive pieces of sculptures. Trees, plants and colourful arrays of flowers are aplenty. 

The dishes that we chose from the splendid menu were delicious. The staff were lovely, welcoming and friendly.

A memorable day.",5,2017,03,29
217,All that glitters is not gold,"My husband and I have just returned from a 4day stay at Powercourt Hotel. We had been looking for that perfect location where we could work, and play in exceptional , luxurious surroundings, and our first impresssions did not disappoint us. The standard of the hotel was laced with awesome surroundings, cosy comfortable bedrooms and stunning views. But all that glitters is not gold...on the second day of our visit we indulged in a rather expensive spa. As is always the case, I removed my favourite white gold necklace, placed it in my robe, and yes, forgot it! When we realised, we quickly called reception and were reassured that this happens all the time and we shouldn't worry. My husband went down to the spa at 7am the next morning, , again we were assured. We were confident that given the status of the hotel, its brand and customer service that it would be found. This was not the case. After many tears, meetings that we initiated, visit from the police we left Powerscourt distraught and without the necklace. Engagement around the loss was clinical, cold and transactional,. As we were leaving the manger didn't even bother to see us off. Please, please don't leave your valuables lying around. I have learnt a very, very painful lesson that I don't want anyone else to learn. It's one thing to experience this facility when things go well, quite another when they don't. So disappointing!",3,2017,03,28
217,So much potential wasted,"Our last leg of a fantastic tour has ended at Powerscourt.  We heard so many great things, and reviews were good.  BUT...

The good: the hotel is beautiful.  The room is beautiful.  We were upgraded to a suite due to my Mariott status, which is beautiful.  That's where it stopped for us.

The bad: service.  Pulling up to the front, I was hoping someone would help us with our car and luggage.  Waited for 10 mins.  Nope, no one there.  I took out the luggage and left it on the curb, still hoping for help.  Nope.  So I parked my car, walked back and struggled to get my bags in the hotel.  THEN someone came up wanting to take my bags.  Don't think so, I have it from here.  Checked in, the receptionist was very nice and showed us where the elevators were.  Unfortunately, they didn't go to our floor.  So we eventually found the right ones after getting on a few.

The biggest complaint is the food service.  After driving from Ashford Castle (which by the way is outstanding), we were hungry.  A waitress came up and seated us, took our drink order, and brought those timely.  She then came back to order food, and asked us if we wanted bread.  Guess what, she disappeared, no bread, and we never saw her again (at least for this).  The manager ended up helping us through the rest of the meal.  Lunch took us almost 2 hrs.  

After sittting around, we went to the bar for a drink.  Guess what, the waitress for lunch showed up.  Took our drink order, and you guessed it, never saw her again.  Another server brought the drinks, and we never saw her again.  No one ever checked on us after that.  We finally flagged down the bartender, who told me that the other servers had left for the night.  Poor guy.  We decided to go to the room and just order room service.

Room service- very nice, the server was excellent, food looked good, and setup nice.  Thank goodness.

The bottom line: beautiful hotel with very subpar service, at least so far.  I think the difference is that this is owned by Mariott, so American owned and probably managed, which doesn't compare to anything else we experienced in Ireland.  They are relying on location, probably convention business, and they know they will get the business because of where they are.  So sad.

We LOVED Ireland, and every place else we visited was off the charts, whether in a Castle or in some of the small B&Bs we stayed in.  Expectations were not met, and this place felt like it is run by a corporation, not by the wonderful Irish.  Which it is.  Shame on you Marriott.  ",2,2017,03,28
217,Shockingly Poor,"This review refers to the Sugar Lounge where we have dined for over 7 years. Ate here recently on St Patricks Day and brought our family and in laws. The menu, which I am told has changed, offered nothing tempting and was based on sandwiches as opposed to hot meal which I found strange on St Patricks Day. We struggled greatly to find something to eat at all from the menu as did all in our group, many opting for Club Sandwich and chips in desperation - hardly what we wanted for St Patricks Day luxury meal in a 5 star hotel. Sandwiches arrived(after an unacceptable wait time) and were cold. 1 of our parents ordered a burger which consisted of a bundy which was burnt and a slice of cheese which was caked onto the meat. The kids pasta was cold also. We constantly needed to call the waiters with cutlery and other items missing at the table.
I have noted a steady deterioration in the food and general service at this hotel since  the Ritz Carlton brand exited the hotel. I have eaten here so much down the years but was embarrassed at what was offered on this visit. All agreed it is time to stop paying this price for such poor food and service.
5 star? In no way is the food offering in line with a 5 star hotel.No manager in sight.",1,2017,03,28
217,Superbly Great Room,"One of the best that I have stayed! Great room and nice views from around. Big room, and bathroom, touch screen control and open balcony whereby you can greet others openly. Breakfast was delicious with options for order others such cappuccino, latte and eggs benedict. Large area with garden around the hotel for jogging and brisk walking. Good to be here!",5,2017,03,27
217,Lovely stay,"Spent three nights here for a business meeting. The room, the food, the service and the atmosphere were lovely. I had a glorious room with a dressing room and marble bathroom, and was very comfortable. The lobby bar and pub were fantastic, and the meeting room and facilities were very comfortable. We had catered lunches and those were also very good. We walked up the hill to the gardens and had a nice walk on the last day- views not to be missed. Two small things which might send this over the top- I am short, and there was no makeup mirror in the bathroom, which made me have to do awkward 'leaning' in the hallway, and there was no coffee on our early departure day- although the staff ran to make some for us before our car left. All in all- lovely",5,2017,03,26
217,"A lovely, lovely place to stay!","I had the pleasure of staying here in early January 2017 with one of my brothers & one of my sisters for a couple of nights at the end of our short New Years trip to Ireland.  We all loved it so much that when I was planning a trip for 3 of my siblings, myself & our parents for March 2017 to celebrate mom's 80th birthday, of course we chose to stay here for a few days of the trip.
We find the hotel to be not only lovely & luxurious but fairly conveniently located to Dublin, making it a terrific stop for either the beginning or ending of a trip to Ireland when flying in & out of Dublin.
We even drove into Dublin for St. Patrick's day to enjoy some of the many things going on there that day.  Leaving the hotel early in the morning, right after our terrific breakfast, we really didn't even have much traffic, taking us less than 30 minutes to get there.
Most everything at Powerscourt is just what you would expect, beautiful & luxurious surroundings with primarily outstanding service throughout.  Sometimes we found that it seemed there might be too many people involved though, which a few times left things that were promised not getting taken care of...as though the message wasn't passed from the one you spoke to along to the one that needed to take care of whatever it was.  Nothing major, we all had a great time there overall & will definitely be back again, however, I didn't feel that I could give it a 5 dot review at this time due to the several minor issues.
One thing I would really like to see before my next visit there in July, would be for the grout in the showers to be thoroughly cleaned/replaced as needed.  In the room we were given in January, there was quite a bit of mold on the grout in many areas of the shower....just not what I feel like you should see in a 5 star resort.  The shower in the room that I had on this visit in March was much better, though still some dark mold in the corners, not anywhere you had to stand, but again, just seems this could be managed/maintained better in a 5 star resort.
The grounds are beyond compare & don't miss the nearby waterfall, easily accessible to all, with parking right near the bottom of the falls, beautiful!
The food in the Sika restaurant is outstanding, both for dinner & for breakfast, truly 5 star service there & 5 star food as well!
The staff in the restaurant in particular seemed to go out of their way to make sure that our mom's birthday experience was one she will never forget & always treasure.
Thank you!!",4,2017,03,25
217,"Beautiful accommodatuon, mediocre food","The Powerscourt hotel offers sumptuous accommodation. We stayed in a beautiful room with a splendid view of the elegant gardens.  However, the beds weren't great - sloping quite dramatically from one end to the other and ensuring that my husband woke up with bone breaking shoulder pain every morning.  Sadly the food was pretty miserable in all the restaurants: the pub fare was poorly seasoned and bland and the breakfast on offer was, at best, ok.  However,  everything was rescued by our  accessibility to the amazing Irish countryside and we went on long walks exploring Enniskerry. Lovely!",3,2017,03,24
217,Nice Hotel in Great Location,"Everything is done to perfection here. The rooms are spacious, well decorated, and comfortable. The mountain view is very pretty. I guess it just felt very large and impersonal. Our overall impression was that this would be a great business hotel.",5,2017,03,23
217,"Great location, great rooms","I stayed here for 2 nights on a short conference.  The hotel is situated in fantastic grounds with the sugar loaf mountain just outside.  Its an amazing find just 45 minutes south of Dublin and seems like a great escape venue to just get-away.  The hotel itself is quite grand and the rooms just fantastic, spacious and comfortable.  In true Irish style the hotel even has its Irish pub in the basement and this had a good atmosphere.  I will most likely come back for a rest.",4,2017,03,23
217,This is an truly amazing place to stay! Could have stayed much longer!,"Less than an hour from Dublin the Hotel is set in the stunning countryside in Enniskerry. The setting is beautiful, the bedrooms and bathrooms immaculate (I don't think I have ever seen such a large walk in wardrobe in a hotel room before!) 
The spa facilities are excellent and there are a great selection of treatments on offer. 
The staff in both the Spa and reception were very helpful and welcoming. 
Trying to get a coffee at the back of the main reception area proved to be a slightly complicated process. A fairly long wait before the surprisingly unfriendly waitress would allow me to be seated....and then another wait before I could order a coffee while she chatted to colleagues.
This obviously didn't ruin my stay and I definitely plan to return to the hotel again when next in Ireland - but would probably avoid returning to that particular part of the hotel if I fancied a coffee ; )
I would highly recommend this hotel. It is wonderful!",5,2017,03,22
217,Exceptional,If you plan to visit Dublin I wouldn't stay anywhere but here. It's just a 30-40 min drive away. The hotel is fabulous. The customer service is second to none in all aspects of the business. The grounds are stunning. The spa is beautiful. The hotel room was simple gorgeous. Do try to get a mountain view room as it's entirely worth any additional cost. The hotel is also accessible- my mother has mobility difficulties but was able to use her scooter throughout the hotel and grounds. There's also a separate walk in shower in addition to a bath. She was very happy! ,5,2017,03,19
217,Afternoon Tea,"If you want to remember a special outing, you will have to pay a visit to this most beautiful Hotel for afternoon tea. WOW, put the calories on hold and go for it. Real meat and Turkey sambos,  hot out of the oven scones, and cakes to die for, and all the tea and coffee, served with great style and courtesy. If you are ever in the garden of Ireland you are in HEAVEN and close to Powerscourt Hotel, in fact stay a Night you will love it. Angela",5,2017,03,17
217,Wait to be amazed!!!!!!!,"From arriving at this most amazing hotel and spa you can only be delighted with your choice.  A very warm welcome greets you, we were given a suite of rooms with outstanding views of the gardens with far reaching views of 'Sugerloaf' mountain within the county of  Wicklow.  All staff were both helpful and friendly, we spent the most fabulous two days here being pampered, room staff were very professional with finer details being observed without any requests. (Including daily newspaper).  Meals were at a very high standard, as was breakfast.  There is a replica Irish pub within the hotel, which takes you back in time, with good Irish pub meals.  If you don't fancy the finer things of life.  There are two golf courses within walking distance, as is a garden centre and good shopping facilities.  In all we enjoyed every minutes of our two days and only wished we could of stayed longer.",5,2017,03,15
217,A great get away,"we stayed here for a weekend and I must say I was impressed.  Check in was seamless and flawless and very pleasant.  Our room was located on the same floor as reception and it was fantastic.  Great bathroom with a deep bath and a rain shower a separate dressing room and a well laid out bedroom with a very comfortable extra large bed.  If I was going to give a negative about this hotel experience it would have been the breakfast, while the selection and choice was good it was all in chaffing dishes which didn't keep it to a good temperature and my breakfast was luke warm at best on both mornings and I was the first person in the sugarloaf lounge for breakfast on the sunday morning.  this was a minor thing and didn't ruin the stay but I do feel that a good breakfast is very important for a hotel.  Complementary car to the village was a nice extra and the driver was a very helpful and pleasant guy.  The hotel is pricey but I didn't feel cheated and I would return again.",5,2017,03,15
217,Excellent hotel,"My wife and I stayed here for a couple of nights during our visits to Ireland. It is about a forty min drive south of the Dublin airport. The grounds are stunning and the property is very welcoming. The staff is very professional, helpful and friendly. The rooms are amazing. The bathrooms are luxury and the beds are super comfortable. Try to get a room facing sugarloaf mountain. The views from the room's balcony are stunning. The restaurants can be expensive but the pub is a good, reasonable choice. Or, enjoy breakfast at the hotel and eat elsewhere for other meals  to save money or take in the local flavors. I strongly recommending staying longer than one night so you can really relax and enjoy the hotel and surrounding area. 
We will return ",5,2017,03,14
217,"Looking forward, but a bit disappointed","We've stayed here in the past and had an amazing break away. But unfortunately this time wasn't up to the same standards. 

Hotel, rooms and facilities were fantastic as usual, but to my surprise it was the staff who let it down. 
Arranged for a bottle of white wine to be in room on check in, but got to room and no wine in sight. 

Had lunch on check-in and while we were in the lounge cafe / bar we had to listen to two bar staff talking about their upcoming trip to Prague and how many bars and strip clubs they were gonna hit! Not great conversation, while I am sitting there with my partner beside me. 

Had lunch and went back to room, and there was a bottle of wine as ordered, but not white a bottle of white. With a card saying happy birthday to me! My partners birthday not mine. Clearly stated in my conversation when booking wine! 

I know this might seem little issues, but it is not a regular occurrence for us to go to this level of hotel on any regular basis, so we were really looking forward to it, and just felt a little let down.",3,2017,03,13
217,Special weekend ,"Just spent the most lovely night with my mum and sister in the Powerscourt Hotel. The room was beautiful we had been upgraded to an amazing mountain view room. Every staff member we met were unbelievable nice, so kind and professional.  Dinner was very good, lovely choice on the menu and the breakfast was really excellent, an huge selection. My only criticism would be there was three people staying in our room, but only two sets of towel, two cups etc. I contacted housekeeping and towels were delivered to the room but not the attention to detail I would have expected. Definitely looking forward to returning in the future! ",4,2017,03,12
217,3 Nights Over the New Year,"I booked a connected suite and stayed with my family after Christmas. We have stayed for 5 years in a row, there has been a change of management and ownership in the hotel in the last 12 months.
We have always enjoyed our stay here, this year was the opposite. A wedding was hosted at the same time and for two days the hotel was full of drunks, badly behaved with equally badly behaved children. It was horrific, the day's cost me well over 2,000 euro. When I complained about the behaviour of the guests I was told by the duty manager 'at least you didn't have to deal with them'. I later called the manager, instead of offering some redress, he said that 'the next time you stay, we'll ensure you have a great time', in other words, 'sod off'. 
The hotel was under staffed, we had to queue 20 minutes for breakfast each morning and were constantly harassed by staff calling to our room instead of another for many different reasons.
This place has gone down hill, we won't ever be back, ever.",1,2017,03,11
217,"Very disappointing breakfast for a "" 5 star property , rude and Inattentive  waiters.","The room at Powerscourt was really comfortable and very roomy. A great space to sleep and just to sit and relax. The pool , sauna and steam room was also a very relaxing and enjoyable space. However , apart from the pub food and service( which was excellent) , the breakfast and bar/ lounge service and food offering was very disappointing. For us the breakfast( which was about the standard of a 3 star hotel on the Costa del Sol, hot food was cold  and inedible) and the service for lunch in the bar totally spoiled our experience in Powerscourt.",3,2017,03,11
217,short changed,"I had a midweek break in powerscourt to relax and enjoy the spa. Firstly the hotel is really nice, room was great and the food in the irish bar was nice with a good atmosphere. I found all the staff helpful also, but the major flaw i found was the spa. It consists of a pool a steam room and sauna...i asked a member of staff was this it as id heard many good things about this place and seen pictures of relaxation areas with views of the surroundings...I was informed unless i was having a treatment or pay an extra 50e PER PERSON i would not be able to avail of the rest of the spa! To be honest i was really disapointed with this and felt really short changed.I have stayed in the cliff house hotel and the europe hotel..all 5star and similar in price to powerscourt but have not had to pay extra money to enjoy all the spa offerings. Really disappointed as it was the main reason i went to the hotel. Overall really nice hotel but the spa is a major let down and i feel is a bit of a money racket.",3,2017,03,10
217,Nice relaxing break close to Dublin ,"We've just returned from an over night break to Powerscourt hotel.  Check in was efficient and quick.  All the staff we met were friendly and polite.  
Pool and sauna was nice to relax in and I spent a leisurely couple of hours there... 
Rooms are comfortable with 2 queens in a twin room.   The grounds of the hotel are beautiful and we had a nice walk around. 

Hotel itself lacked that special something for me but I can't put my finger on what it was missing. ",4,2017,03,06
217,"Beautifully Ornate and Stately Hotel, Delicious Tasting (but Lukewarm) Food, Consistently Inattentive and SLOW Service.","The title above perfectly sums up our February 2017 experience at Powerscourt for me. I will continue to summarise below. 

The Pros:

The service received at reception was very warm, friendly, welcoming and efficient.  

The hotel itself is breathtakingly ornate and stately, with incredible attention to detail in both furnishings and decor throughout. It is not dissimilar to Claridges in London, but on a much larger scale. Even the very lifts are entirely panelled in mahogany and brass, with crystal chandeliers! 

The nearby beautiful Powerscourt gardens (National Geographic) are not to missed. Also, the Avoca cafe/ food hall and various boutiques are a very welcome addition. This is all within an easy 5 minute walk from the hotel entrance. 

The suite (412) we stayed in was pristinely clean, spacious and very well appointed. I was pleased to see a very spacious separate dressing room! There were excellent views of the surrounding resort gardens and mountains. The beds were very comfortable and the blackout curtains provided the perfect environment for a great nights sleep. I loved the little touches, like a TV in the bathroom mirror and the touchscreen panels in every room controlling lighting, temperature, windows and curtains. 

The menu choices in the various restaurants we tried were excellent. We had no trouble finding something suitable to eat. The quality of food was very good in terms of flavour, presentation and use of local provenance.

The Cons:

We dined at the hotel for breakfast, lunch and dinner and on all three occasions service was consistently very very slow, extremely inattentive and generally poor. Food was also consistently lukewarm, if not closer to cold. I have since spoken to several friends who've recently visited the hotel on separate occasions and they all remarked the same things about service and temperature of food. We waited for 25 minutes before our food order was taken at lunch, the whole time while trying to flag down a non-existent member of staff. The food took a further 20-30 minutes to arrive and was close to cold when it did. Dinner was the exact same experience but worse! We waited longer than 25 minutes to have our order taken. Our water was topped up once during the meal and we couldn't seem to find staff members in the vicinity to flag down. Our starter plates weren't cleared before our main course. Our main course arrived on top of dirty plates. Our main courses were all lukewarm. After our main course my empty plate was removed while my sister was still eating. There were VERY long waits between courses and limited access to serving staff. Totally disastrous and disappointing considering the high sum spent on the evening. 

We went to the lounge for cocktails after dinner and again waited for approximately 20 minutes before our order was taken. We received our drinks relatively quickly and they were of a good standard. I was disappointed that no appetisers were provided with our drinks. I have never ordered a high priced cocktail in a five-star establishment and not received some accompanying salted snacks such as olives, pretzels etc. Our group wanted to order more drinks but we waited 30 minutes and were never approached, so we decided to retire to our rooms. 

A very minor note about the room amenities and services. I was disappointed that a turn down service was not provided. I consumed a bottle of mineral water provided earlier in the day and this should have been replaced during turn down. Also, there were no complimentary cookies/biscuits provided with the very limited selection of complimentary tea and coffee (little to no herbal infusions or decaf options). These are all little touches that matter, touches I expect from a five-star hotel. 

When I consider the pros and cons on balance, whilst the hotel is aesthetically maginificent, it is clear that service standards do not match up. My father booked two suites for my mother and my two sisters for spa weekend (at a great expense). He/we expected so much from Powerscourt and it unfortunately didn't live up to these high expectations. The service really did take away considerably from our experience. I would like to return for the grandeur of the building, but I'm unsure that I would unless I was assured that service had improved considerably.",4,2017,03,03
217,Disappointment,"We recently stayed at powerscourt hotel and we were disappointment by a number of small issues. we spoke to reception in relation to couple issues in the room,the shower floor had mould & there was a lack of shampoo,none we dealt with also on arrival the desk in the room had a drawer left out which my wife knocked off accidentally and cut her leg. we then tried to use the swarovski crystal swimming pool to relax, but the pool was been used by group of people for racing up & down the pool, which we understand this was not the fault of the hotel. at breakfast the next morning our table was served by staff member with a dirty uniform which we had to ask for tea three times.   
The hole experience was not what we had expected from this five star .",3,2017,03,02
217,Reboot and recharge,The OH and I stayed here for a night in December and thoroughly enjoyed it. We were upgraded to a suite which was absolutely beautiful. Overall the hotel standard is extremely high. Fantastic surroundings and close proximity to the motorway /Bray/Dublin make this hotel a real winner. During our stay the hotel was decorated for Christmas which made it feel even more magical. We made great use of the spa the next morning which is a definite benefit. Can't wait to stay again,5,2017,03,02
217,Annual treat,"If you want to treat yourself and feel like you deserve something very nice this is the place to go & stay. From welcome, Spa facilities, food in the restaurant and including the location its self, its simply stunning! I love coming back here, always worth the money.",5,2017,02,28
217,A wonderful treat,"Visited this hotel just before Christmas as part of a small Christmas party.  Checkin was friendly and efficient.  Our room was wonderful and comfortable - so so spacious and decorated in a subtle if old fashioned style.  Bathroom was great with the TV in the mirror...nice touch!  Loved the Espa products in the bathroom.  

Enjoyed a wonderful dinner that night - food and service were excellent.  Such a lovely sleep in that huge comfy bed.  Breakfast in the bedroom the next morning was great.  We then sepnt some wonderful time in the ESPA - amazing treatments.  After we checked out we strolled to Powerscourt house and enjoyed looking around the AVoca shop there.

Highly recommend for a relaxing luxury night away that will leave you feeling like you've been away for a week.",5,2017,02,28
217,Super but expensive ,"Had lunch with my nephew in the lobby restaurant . Gorgeous view and excellent service . Lunch menu wasn't bad - perhaps some more lighter choices would be good . The club sandwich at €17 was expensive but my nephew really enjoyed it . I had a falafel and it was lovely at €12 . Most of the wine in region of €10 a glass ! 

The only criticism was I was initially told  the restaurant was full which wasn't the case as I counted quite a no of empty tables . Apparently the tables reserved for well over an hour later  at 3pm . If was 1.45pm when we arrived and wanted something light to eat . 

I had to really press the chap on duty for a table for a quick light lunch. Not exactly thinking outside the box on his part and quite an attitude  which I thought was a v poor show . .... ",4,2017,02,27
217,Afternoon Tea Experience,I went for afternoon tea yesterday with my friend to use my 40th birthday voucher i received last year. This was one of my top asks for my birthday and I was excited to attend. Did not catch the name of the person at the restaurant checkin but he was not the friendliest person. We were seated at a table by the window which was stunning and were given the menus and asked if it had been expained to us. We say no the girl serving us was friendly and looked after us well for the first 40 mins. I have to say the food was nice but not amazing sandwiches were a bit safe/bland. We had to gesture a few times to get peoples attention to ask for more hot water. We took a little break before getting the deserts but seem to then be forgotten about and took about 10 mins to get someone to come back to us. Deserts were show on a plate and we got to pick 2 of them each. Deserts were the nicest part of the afternoon tea. I have to say overall i was a little disappointed I thought the service and staff would be a lot better and the sandwiches ok. When compared to the Afternoon Tea experience at The Shelbourne Hotel i think it was very average and would not recommend to others. A pity as the views and hotel is amazing...,3,2017,02,27
217,"Exquisite surroundings, gorgeous hotel, good food and uneven to great service.","General:
Situated in an exquisite part of Wicklow, below the Sugar Loaf Mountain, with amazing scenery. The hotel looks impressive on the outside, promising a lot for the inside and it delivers. It's like stepping into a different time, opulence aplenty, comfortable and homely feel.

Arrival:
Driving up to the hotel affords you a spectacular view of the grounds and the surrounding area. We found a decent spot to park and ambled into the hotel to check in at reception. The process was pleasant and efficient.

Room:
We got upgraded to a lovely room on the 6th floor. The rooms are luxurious, comfortable and tastefully decorated as well as spacious. Apart from the odd niggle, like a stuck wardrobe door and some dented furniture, everything else is well looked after. The mini bar is well stocked, there's plenty of wardrobe space, a lovely sitting area, writing desk, large screen TV and a truly luxurious bed. We slept well in the king size bed and were well rested every morning.

Stay:
We enjoyed a lovely weekend, relaxing, eating and walking around the gorgeous grounds. A better way to spend a weekend is difficult to come up with. Everywhere you go you're struck by the beauty of the place. It's like stepping back in time, and a great way to relieve stress.

Restaurants:
- Sugar Loaf Lounge
Excellent pre-dinner cocktails, albeit on the pricey side, in lush surroundings. The service was a tad haphazard which let the overall impression down a bit.

- Sika Restaurant
We had dinner on Friday night at the Sika restaurant. The menu is deceptively simple. It more than delivers, with some wonderful flavours and looks. We had the pleasure of being well looked after by our Italian waiter, who kept us feeling happy, relaxed and guided us where needed in terms of drinks pairing. This was a highlight, a pleasant surprise. The Sika restaurant is a great venue for a lovely meal, though quite open which makes it less appealing for romantic interludes.

- McGill's Bar
Our Saturday night dinner was good, though I'm disappointed with the lack of beer/ale selection. We both had soup (tomato soup and seafood chowder), and I went for the divine spicy falafel burger with sweet potato fries. My wife had the steak. Beside the lack of beers/ales the chunky fries were a tad soggy (too long at the pass?).

- Breakfast at the Sika Restaurant
The breakfast buffet is good, though not earth-shattering as one might expect of a place as the Powerscourt Hotel. It's a decent enough selection and a full Irish always goes down a treat even though it's lukewarm at best. This could be much improved.

Departure:
Quick checkout and an otherwise uneventful departure.

We'll definitely come back for another relaxing weekend towards the end of this year.",4,2017,02,26
217,Beautiful Hotel,"We were there for 3 days. The hotel is beautiful, it used to be a Ritz Carlton and I can see why. The hotel grounds are amazing, the hotel is set in the country.  The staff couldn't have been nicer. My wife used the SPA for a massage and it was very nice. I can not comment on the dinner service since we were out every night. The breakfast was included in our stay(which was a nice surprise) it was a buffet not bad. We had afternoon tea and that was VERY GOOD, they give you so much food, very tasty. As a side note we had dinner at Johnny Foxes it is a pub not far from the hotel. Ask the staff about it you won't be disappointed all the food is locally sourced YUMMERS!",5,2017,02,26
217,Fantastic spa facility,"The spa is fantastic. The staff, especially the Romanian lady masseuse and beauty therapist are so friendly attentive and professional. I would highly recommend to all.
The layout of the area is very good with nothing amiss. Lunch served after the treatments is excellent",5,2017,02,26
217,Absolute Heaven,"Unfortunately I will be checking out of the Powerscourt Hotel in the next few minutes, myself and my husband just spent two nights here. From the moment we arrived we were treated so well, the staff were very friendly & so helpful. The breakfast was excellent and there was a huge choice, in general the food was excellent throughout the hotel. Our King Suite was fabulous and spotless clean, this hotel is absolute heaven and we can't wait to return. We have stayed in a number of five star hotels and this is definitely one of the best. ",5,2017,02,25
217,Exquisite,The grounds and hotel facility are beautiful and maintained to the highest level.  The lounge and restaurant provide wonderful delicious food.  The buffet breakfast at the Sika was enormous and complete with hot and cold foods.  The fresh fruit selection was generous.  Our room was spacious.,5,2017,02,24
217,Lunch in the lounge,"I spoke with Kasia in the lounge this morning to ask about booking afternoon tea. She was extremely polite and helpful. She bent over backwards to help me and gave me contact details so we could check with our friends before booking. I phoned about twenty minutes later while visiting the famous Powerscourt gardens and tried to book afternoon tea. I was told that there was no space but could book a table for lunch in the lounge for 1.30pm which I accepted and the lady I spoke to took my name and confirmed my booking. 
When my party and I arrived we were greeted by Bhavic the lounge manager who was very rude to us in his manor and said there was no room and all the tables were booked! There was no booking for us?!
Because I was understandably unhappy and would not accept this he said he would sit us in the foyer until a table came available. He said we could not have afternoon tea because it has to be booked 24hrs in advance. This was the first I had heard of this. We would have to be split into two groups despite there being three empty tables together. Two of those tables remained empty the entirety of our stay about two and half hours? Several tables were vacated. We were seated on two tables split apart. One of our party was in a wheelchair and we were seated on a small table with very little room for manoeuvre. Bhavic left us. One of our party was left waiting for a chair and he never returned until asked for one about ten minutes later. Extremely annoying when there were several empty tables which would have been more suitable. After waiting a very long time for the chair and nothing materialising we moved to an empty table and he said he had just taken a booking from another guest who was about to sit there so moved us to the next table over which was much more suitable for wheel chair access. Our two tables were served by Martin and Kasia who were both very professional and friendly and a credit to the hotel. They saved the day. We were really looking forward to a treat and a get together of friends who have come from far and wide to meet up. We were a party of nine in total. We really enjoyed the setting, food and staff with the exception of Bhavic who even appeared to be quite rude with his own hard working staff. I would think twice about returning after that experience. We were expecting a treat not disrespect and contempt.

217,Incredible,"We had a business trip for around 14 days in Powerscourt and it's among the best hotels I've ever stayed at. 

Staff is just amazing and do whatever they can to help, the facilities are really nice and confortable, food is great in Sika restaurant and the surroundings are very beautiful

See you next time!",5,2017,02,23
217,"Luxury, all the way!","An exceptional Hotel with nothing left unattended to. Rooms are opulent and the Spa is top of the line! A fine pub inside, with great food, service and personality!

The bartender provided an fine array of whiskey for friends to do a tasting!",5,2017,02,22
217,Relax to the max,"Really gorgeous hotel - lovely spacious rooms, splendid spa-facilities in a lovely surrounding. The breakfast is exquisite! 
The Powerscourt Estate is very nice to wander around (bring your walking shoes!)",5,2017,02,21
217,Exceptional Service,Got surprised by my boyfriend with a special valentine's dinner at Powerscourt Hotel. We arrived early to soak in the atmosphere of the place and was told our table was waiting. The service provided was exceptional and we were well looked after by Conor who managed our reservation. We had a table by the window looking out at the fountain and the food was amazing. The staff were all very pleasant and attentive.  We enjoyed every minute. Cannot recommend it enough.,5,2017,02,20
217,Spa day of excellence,"From booking a spa day here until leaving after the treatments the service provided was outstanding. The hotel itself is situated in the picturesque  village of Enniskerry. My partner had a facial and said it was the best ever, special thank you to Una. I had a deep tissue massage by Aga and it was amazing. The facilities, pool, Jacuzzi etc are great, very clean and in great order. A huge thank you to the staff. Highly recommend a spa day or an overnight. Well worth the money",5,2017,02,20
217,World class hotel in a beautiful Irish country location!,"My wife and I thoroughly enjoyed our stay at the Powerscourt Hotel. Fabulous facilities at the hotel, spacious room and bathroom with sweeping views of Sugarloaf Mountain and the Irish countryside. You would never guess that Dublin was 30 minutes away!
The Powerscourt estate and gardens were next door- any easy walk and such a beautiful place!

The staff at the hotel was efficient, accommodating and friendly. I would highly recommend this hotel.",5,2017,02,17
217,"Fun, food and drink!",When we arrived there was a bit of a delay on reception however I don't think this was anything to do with staff there was a customer in front of us who seemed a bit hard to please. The receptionists were friendly and asked if we needed hlp with our bags and also offered a complimentary car to enniskery village if we wanted to visit it! The rooms are so spacious and clean. The decor is really nice and the mini bar is filled with really nice alcohol and soft drinks. The bathrooms are beautiful and have two sinks. The pool and jacuzzi in the spa are lovely and all the staff were really friendly and attentive. We were supposed to go for a meal in the restaraunt in the hotel but we had lunch in the bar at around 4pm and were full for the rest of the day. The portions are really big and the food is to die for. The atmosphere in the pub is great and there was a great band on for entertainment. We also got room service later that night of soup and a sandwich which was really nice considering it was 3am. To top it all off the beds were the most comfortable beds I have ever stayed in! Had a really great stay here!,5,2017,02,15
217,WOWWWWWWW,"simply amazing...room bigger than my first apartment, elegant beyond words.  Staff gracious and helpful getting us into Dublin and cheering us upon return when we visited the bar with a closing beer. Gardens spectacular, room like sleeping in a cloud and bathing in a soothing wrap.  thank you!!!!!!!!!!!!!!",5,2017,02,13
217,Fabulous Hotel,"We stayed for one night on 11 February in a second floor room, room 222. It was located at the end of a corridor and was very large. All the usual amenities you would expect in a five star hotel, although it didn't have an Nespresso machine which I found disappointing for a hotel of this class.  The bathroom was huge with Espa toiletries. The food, both at dinner and breakfast, was really good, very fresh with lots of options. I would highly recommend this hotel. The staff are exceptionally well trained and look after your every need. Hopefully next time I'll get a chance to try the spa. ",5,2017,02,13
217,Beautiful hotel ,"Really beautiful hotel, lovely staff. It was a pleasure to be there. Can't wait to go back.

Pool is amazing and food is wonderful.

My only suggestion on what to change would be to have to pool open longer and food served all day as the bar only opens in the evening.

It's the best hotel I ever been to in Ireland and would recommend to all my family and friends.  Thank you so much for running such an amazing hotel.",5,2017,02,12
217,Beautiful stay,"Stayed with the Girlfriend for 2 nights opted for the upgraded mountain view room, at check in we were told that we booked one of the nicest rooms, and as we got to the room it didn't disappoint, beautiful. Overall it was a lovely stay, just few minor points, the spa area was a bit noisy with kids as we wanted to relax but I guess it's not the hotels fault, one of the mornings we ordered breakfast in the room and for €29 pp and an extra €5 for the service, it was disappointing, you had to fill in a card ticking the boxes of your preferred choice and leave it outside your door before 2 a.m the night before, we put 9:30 am delivery, when it got to 9:35 I opened the door and the breakfast card was still there, after ringing the reception i found out that they never collected the order and having planned to have breakfast at 9:30 am we ended up eating at 10:20.. NOT ACCEPTABLE from this type of hotel... anyway overall beautiful hotel beautiful room, and very welcoming at reception. ",5,2017,02,12
217,Just what the doctor ordered,"Had a really enjoyable stay with our three children. Can't wait to go back next month! The grounds are specular and the food,  beverages and service was outstanding.  The staff are just so helpful,  welcoming and friendly. A hidden gem 💎 ",5,2017,02,10
217,Bmw Awards trip.,"We loved everything about the hotel, the staff made ever effort to accommodate our needs and helped me set up a proposal in the gardens for my girlfriend. Our room was perfect and the spa 
was great also.",5,2017,02,08
217,5 star in every aspect!!,"Went to celebrate my wife's birthday last week - could not fault in any aspect.
Friendly genuine staff from checkin right through our stay.
Dined in Sika - absolutely fantastic - fish main course one of the best!!!
Definitely one of the top 5 star hotels in the country.
Will be back.........",5,2017,02,06
217,Well worth a visit!,Absolutely stunning location. From arrival through the gates the atmosphere is out of this world. The hotel itself is beautiful. Our room was gorgeous we upgraded and the space was amazing. The bathroom was fabulously decked out with tv screens. Lovely experience here,5,2017,02,05
217,Beautiful rooms ,"We just spent 2 wonderful nights here.
Check in was busy but they still had time for a laugh and a joke as they sped us through the check in process. 
Free WiFi throughout the hotel. Fast WiFi too. 
The rooms are stunning & huge. We had fantastic views of the mountains from our balcony. 
Staff are very friendly and helpful throughout the hotel. ",5,2017,02,05
217,5 stars? uh... no,"We live in West Cork and I heard how great this hotel was so I booked a weekend there my wife on her birthday. Ordered flowers and wine for the room. At reception line was 6 deep. One person working. Valet?-no, Concierge?-no. Nice room with great beds and the flowers were there-no wine. Shower is spacious but mold around the shower bottom grout. When room was cleaned the coffee and drink remains from the night before stayed behind. Breakfast was adequate on Sunday morning but nothing to write home about. 

So, 5 stars? Not a chance. Maybe 4 if things spiff up. ",3,2017,02,05
217,Overrated 5 star me ....,"Where do I start , the hotel was fabulous , the surrounding , the gardens were great . The food was ok - good . The cleanness of the room was horrible . The bed was bearly make , just thrown together . Creased , dirty looking and a hair on the pillow . 😷 The window sills were full of dead flies  , picture to prove it below . When said to the manager was offered €50 off the bill . Joke I know . Bill still worked out over €200 , for a night with flies . Needless to say wouldn't go back , let down for such beautiful surrounding .",1,2017,02,02
217,Midweek Break,"Since arriving in the Powerscourt Hotel yesterday evening we were greeted with the utmost hospitality by all the staff.
Hotel absolutely beautiful and relaxing,food top quality.
Definitely 5 out of 5 stars from my wife and I
Highly recommend it for a relaxing break. ",5,2017,02,02
217,A Wonderful Time!,"We had a wonderful time at Powerscourt. It was my mothers birthday and a very special occasion. The hotel staff could not have been nicer..from the moment we arrived to the time we left the staff made our time very special.  We had complementary sweets to our room and a lovely surprise of a birthday desert.   The hotel gave us a beautiful room with the most comfortable beds and everything we needed.  We had a beautiful meal and a fantastic breakfast to finish off our stay.   The spa is very relaxing and the treatments and staff were great.
I would definitely  recommend this hotel to anyone and we will be back!

",5,2017,02,02
217,"Amazing, worth the money!","My stay here at Powerscourt did not disappoint. We arrived early, and asked was it possible to check in (had requested early check in). The room we booked wasnt ready but we got upgraded to a suite which was really lovely and set the start of the whole stay. The rooms are amazing, clean and we were in the lap of luxury. The service was excellent from the reception staff, to the spa and mcgills bar. The spa was so fantastic also more than I expected, very relaxing and spent a good few hours there. Just do note that they have kids time from 4pm to 6pm and at some stage in the morning, and while this is perfectly fine just note the lights are turned on during this time, while at other times it is dark in the spa which I preferred but it was excellent anyway. Honestly myself and my partner left thinking we wish we were staying another night and we would definitely come back. There wasnt any flaws with this hotel at all until we got home. When I arrived home I got an email saying there were 3 fizzy drinks missing from the mini bar and they would charge my card for this if they didnt hear back in 48 hours. We didnt have any drinks from the mini bar and paid for the snacks we had on checkout, so this email did throw me off and left a feeling they thought I didnt pay for something. I am still giving 5 stars because the stay was amazing but obviously the mini bar wasnt checked after the last guests, so I would ensure this happens as the email wasnt a great end to a perfect stay.",5,2017,01,31
217,Fabulous Stay,"This was a last minute decision and boy, were we happy we came here. An initial hiccup was swiftly dealt with and the staff couldn't do enough for us. The spa area was wonderful for adults and children alike and our five year old could't wait to get into the pool each day. There's lots to see in the area and our short break ended with one of the best breakfasts we've had in a long time. We'll be back!",5,2017,01,26
217,Tranquil Location and excellent friendly service ,"The Powerscourt hotel is situated 1.5 km outside Enniskerry village.  Enniskerry is a wonderful old world feeling village with boutiques and coffee shops.  

The Powerscourt Hotel is very comfortable and spacious.  The rooms are very well appointed with no expense spared.  McGill's pub has a lovely relaxed and traditional atmosphere serving great food all day.

During my 2 night stay I experienced great food and very friendly, professional and courteous staff.

The gardens are beautifully maintained and must be walked.  The golf is also superb.

I look forward to my return.

Mark",5,2017,01,26
217,Amazing,"Went to the hotel on our babymoon, it was everything I needed to relax before our new arrival. Everything about the hotel is better than any hotel I've ever been in, staff are super, beds are amazing, food outstanding. I cannot say enough and really can't wait for my next visit",5,2017,01,25
217,Incredible!,We stayed for 4 nights at this beautiful hotel and we are totally spoiled now! The rooms & baths are fabulous and the staff is wonderful. Our room & terrace looked out on the SugarLoaf Mountain. An added benefit to staying here is that you receive access to the vast grounds of the Powerscourt Estate. ,5,2017,01,25
217,Luxurious escape,"Lovely large room with super comfortable bed.  Bathroom oozed luxury.  Afternoon tea very disappointing for such a luxurious hotel, save the eating for the restaurant which was much better.  Lovely surroundings for an escape.",4,2017,01,25
217,Afternoon tea bliss ,"From the moment our group arrived at Powerscourt hotel we were welcomed so warmly by the staff. 

The Afternoon tea was delicious, the portions are very generous, cutlery spotless and there was an excellent selection of deserts. 

The setting is beautiful, I recommend asking for a table by the window.

Our server was exceptional. She was extremely attentive yet not pushy and she gave us adequate time between courses. 
I have been to many 5* hotels in Dublin for afternoon tea and Powerscourt is the best by a mile. ",5,2017,01,23
217,Wonderful!,"I stayed here two nights, ending a road trip around Ireland. It was AMAZING - perfect end to the trip. The hotel is fancier and more resort like, so if you're looking for homey, quintessential 'ireland' this is not it. Staff was gracious, helpful and personable. Rooms were large with luxurious bathrooms and dressing rooms. Views of mountains and back grass were beautiful. The staff took us into Enniskerry to walk around  and eat dinner, which was nice. Dinner was great - not much to see when walking around, maybe took an hour at the most. There's a tiny tiny antique consignment store at top of hill and then Magpies bookstore were my favorites. The hotel has high tea, which was fabulous - definitely make reservations. There was plenty of food and tea to hold you over through dinner time. We walked to the Powerscourt Gardens which was my favorite - walking though there was amazing to see the different gardens, mountains, redwoods and more. The shopping at the Garden was PERFECT to get all my gifts to bring home - and they ship for $22 back to the states - can't beat that. I will definitely go back to stay, if not make a weekend trip of just going here.",5,2017,01,22
217,"Charming, welcoming","I loved this hotel. From the staff, grounds, views, food, the rooms. This hotel should be rated 6*+. The rooms offer every creature comfort you can imagine to a TV in the mirror of the bathroom. This hotel is old time elegance, if you want modern, plastic this hotel is not for you. The golf course has spectacular views the sheep and horses crossing the main road on the  way into the resort. This is a must stop. ",5,2017,01,22
217,Magnificent Hotel,"We were there only for a long weekend. 
The room was pretty nice.  I remember the French door to separate the bedroom from the living room area and the TV embedded into the bathroom mirror. Good restaurant too. Fantastic service.  A plus the beautiful views and the proximity to the gardens. 
Ideal place for a special occasion. ",4,2017,01,22
217,Birthday night,"Well what can I say, I just love love Powerscourt hotel it's just amazing and definitely 5 star. The facilities are excellent service is fantastic and the spa is just a piece of heaven. I would recommend the hotel to all !!! It's for everyone you won't be disappointed.The views and the grounds around are spectacular and worth a visit.",5,2017,01,21
217,Supporting the Irish,"Fabulous hotel and gardens. Luxurious rooms. Nice restaurant for breakfast. Irish style pub bar and sumptuous lounge area for light lunch, tea and coffee, or even that alcoholic libation. 

It was real shame I stayed in the bar too long to enjoy my suite; lounge, bed and walk in wardrobe. I should planned more time here!  

Easy drive down the M50. The locals say it takes any hour. I did it in 35 mins to/from the car rentals area.",5,2017,01,21
217,Afternoon Tea a wonderful expeience,"Having experienced Afternoon Tea at other well known establishments – even the “Vintage Tea” – we were sceptical about what to expect at Powerscourt Hotel. But we needn’t have been , this was a truly wonderful experience. The selection of sandwiches, scones not to mention the excellent deserts and as for the array of teas to choose from, all well presented and explained by our very helpfully, waitress Lauren.  Thank You, Lauren for your professionalism and helping make our well deserved day out memorable for all the right reasons. We will be back. Carolyn",5,2017,01,21
217,First and last time,"I knew we should have stuck with a night away in our dependable favourite The Merrion. I tried to tell the husband that, but he wanted to try something new to celebrate our 10th Wedding Anniversary. First impressions.... village was cute and then BAM this white thing just juts out of nowhere. Check in was impersonal, bar was packed with afternoon tee takers and very noisy and open. There was a large function on in the hotel and my God did we know it! Spa treatments were ok. Service in the restaurant was appalling which is a shame because the food was quite good. Would I go back.... easy answer, No.",3,2017,01,19
217,Short Luxury Break,"An amazing hotel set in awesome surroundings. The room was very large having a seating area, writing desk, ensuite, storage room and the most comfortable bed I have ever slept in. All meals were of an exceptional standard but at the same time very relaxed. Service was of an exemplar standard. Although we did not have a spa treatment there was full use of the tranquil pool sauna and steam room. Views over the mountains from bedroom and eating areas an added bonus. By far the best hotel I've stayed in this year.",5,2017,01,19
217,Sheer luxury and relaxing time,"My friends and I had the pleasure of staying at this hotel in November. From start to finish I was wowed at every aspect of the hotel. We stayed for 2 nights and were checked in seamlessly by an efficient and helpful girl called colleen. On the first night we wined and dined in the sugarloaf lounge where the staff were attentive to our every need. Our room was outstanding. On the second day we treated ourselves to some time in the espa. 
Thanks for a lovely time we will be back hopefully soon.",5,2017,01,19
217,excellent stay!!,"Oh what a place! The room was beautiful and spacious with a gorgeous view. The service was top notch attentive and warm. The food was good. The walks in the surrounding countryside around are spectacular. We had been blessed with unusual warm, sunny weather. And the spa OMG brilliant, relaxing and for some reason all to ourselves as there was no one else around. A special stay indeed! Very highly recommended for a fantastic getaway!!",5,2017,01,17
217,Missing spark,"Powerscourt has many positive aspects. Firstly the setting is wonderful with beautiful grounds, and our suite had a lovely view of the mountains. The room as one would expect was spacious and well equipped.

I booked the trip to celebrate our anniversary and I was somewhat disappointed when we arrived in our room to find nothing to mark the occasion, however this was rectified later when we returned, with a note and small selection of chocolates.

The spa was very good, we both had treatments and thoroughly enjoyed our massages, while the relaxation room was lovely. The spa pool, and steam room were also good.

The McGills bar was great with a real buzz about it, the Ireland rugby match may have help in this regard!

While we didn't eat here the bar food looked good.

We chose to eat in the Sika restaurant. In the early stages the service was good. We both had the scallops to start and they were exceptional, we enjoyed our main courses while the cheese board was standard issue and nothing to write home about.

Later in the meal the staff were concentrating their efforts dealing with the last big table of the night, we tried to attract someones attention on a number of occasions to get the bill but I was left to wait outside the kitchen until a member of staff finally appeared so I could ask for it. 

This simply shouldn't happen in the hotels top restaurant, which accordingly charges top prices. 

We also had lunch in the lobby bar.

In the area we were seated one member of staff was trying to deal with a large number of tables. This resulted in a significant wait. 

She seemed to be under pressure but was very pleasant. 

Our next door neighbour visited Powerscourt over Christmas with his wife and made exactly the same observation.   

More staff would help greatly here and really improve the guest experience.

I started this review by saying Powerscourt has many positive aspects however there is a but...

The guest experience was reasonably pleasant and no more, staff were on the whole reasonably efficient but given the standards other top hotels set around the world you expect a lot more.

OK and reasonably satisfactory are not the feelings Powerscourt should leave departing guests with.

At the top end of the hotel market and given the competition that exists you pay for and expect an exceptional guest experience from start to finish. 

In essence the guest experience doesn't feel special.

Once again without hearing my views on Powerscourt my neighbour who travels extensively around the world and stays in top hotels, had exactly the same experience.

For him and his wife it was simply ok and satisfactory and if we are brutally honest neither he or I would rush back to Powerscourt.",3,2017,01,17
217,Amazing Stay,"We stayed at this beautiful hotel for two nights last week. We chose here as we were celebrating a very special occasion. From the moment we arrived to the time we left it was like Heaven on earth. The staff were so helpful, friendly, polite and accommodating. We were upgraded to a suite when we arrived as a special treat for the special occasion we were celebrating which we were absolutely delighted with and so thankful for and wow what a treat, so much so we just spent the whole first day in our suite, it was huge. We dined in the restaurant and the food, the wine and the service was excellent. The spa was fabulous, I booked two treatments and they were both amazing. We managed to venture outside the second day, so much to see and do around the area. Overall a truly wonderful experience, we cannot wait to return again. Thank you to all concerned.",5,2017,01,16
217,Amazing Stay at an Amazing Hotel,"Just returned from a 1 night stay at this hotel. We stayed in a courtyard suite and it was super comfortable. There is a beautiful living area, a fantastic enormous walk in dressing area with storage to die for. The bathroom is truly stunning and the bedroom is spacious and the beds are really comfortable. 
We ate in the bar which was lovely but next time I would love to try the restaurant as it looked really good. but it was full last night!
The views are stunning and there are beautiful walks and the routes are clearly explained by the staff in the hotel. They also provide maps! You can also hire bikes.
The staff are exceptional and nothing is a problem for them a truly 5 star experience.
If I was to have a criticism it would be in relation to the provisions in the bedroom, there were 3 of us but there was only 2 robes and not enough towels and toiletries, I think they provided for 2 guests. But once we rang down for extra they arrived pretty much immediately again a 5 star service!
Breakfast was out of this world, we had a table looking out on the amazing views. The food was exceptional and the choice was enormous. 
I will return as soon as I can, I loved it",5,2017,01,15
217,Luxury hotel but very pricey! ,"We stayed here for one night, we had a voucher but it's very expensive. If it was a special occasion I will return but otherwise the prices are very dear! We had bar food and one cocktail each, the cocktails were €18 for a cosmo. It is a lovely hotel & great service. ",5,2017,01,14
217,Absolutely fantastic,"We sent 2 nights in this hotel over Christmas, my wife, my parents-in-law, my sister-in-law & her family (husband & 2 kids). Firstly, I have to commend the staff on how accommodating they were: usually their Christmas package does not allow for arrival on Christmas Day, you either have to arrive on 24th or 26th December for the 2 night package. However, it only suited us to arrive on Christmas Day itself so the hotel made an exception. In fact this set the tone for our entire stay: the staff were incredible - they could not do enough for you. Our stay was amazing from start to finish. The hotel had a wonderful Christmasy atmosphere and the food was superb. We had suites and they were great - large sitting room, kitchen, large bedroom, dressing room, large bathroom. I cannot recommend this hotel highly enough. If we are back in Ireland for Christmas 2017 we will defiantly be staying in Powerscourt again. Thank you to all the team.",5,2017,01,14
217,Bank Holiday Getaway,"Amazing place to stay, was in a suite and I've never experienced a more luxurious place to stay. Both the golf and gardens were spectacular, highly recommended. Was also at a wedding here in July 2015 and it was incredible. Splashed out and I don't regret a thing!",5,2017,01,13
217,lovely stay here,"was t a wedding and decided to make a weekend out of it and stayed here,  lovely hotel and lovely staff made feel very welcome indeed.  fab place thank you guys for looking after us. we will be back as a treat.",5,2017,01,11
217,A very disappointing waste of money,"I had arranged the weekend stay to mark my wife’s 40th birthday and given the reputation and rating we were looking forward to the weekend. However we immediately got off to a bad start, I had told the hotel that it was my wife’s 40th and asked that a bottle of prosecco be delivered to the room and something to be in the room to acknowledge her birthday. I also checked that this had been noted on the account when I rang to confirm the reservation two days prior to our stay. I was therefore quite disappointed to arrive in the room and to find nothing arranged to be in place. I contacted reception and explained the situation. I agreed with the receptionist that I would instead go to the bar and order a bottle there. I was, to say the least, disappointed when we arrived back to the room to find the bottle of prosecco had now been delivered, along with a printed card wishing me (rather than my wife) a happy birthday. It was overall a very disappointing start. 
 Had this been the only issue, it would not have been a problem; however things were to get significantly worse. We had a number of issues with the room; the air-conditioning was very noisy but when we turned it off the room became uncomfortably warm very quickly. The control panel for the lights would not turn off leaving us with effectively a blue nightlight on the wall glowing throughout the night. The curtains did not meet and had a gap above the floor meaning the room became quite bright first thing in the morning. After quite a poor night sleep we decided to ask to change rooms and offered to pay the additional charge to upgrade to a suite for the remaining night. The receptionist, this was just after 11am, told us she wasn’t able to check room availability at that time but took a note of our issues and told us she would get back to us.  At 2pm we still had not heard from reception, which we felt was quite poor, so we called back down. There was no note of our query so we discussed the issues once again with a different receptionist. This receptionist said she did not believe there were any rooms available but would discuss this with the housekeeping team and call us. We waited for this call for over 2 hours, it never came. Shortly after 4 we again returned to reception, to again find that third receptionist was unable to find any record of our query.  At this stage our frustration levels had reached near breaking point, we did however explain the situation once again and the third receptionist, who was very helpful and understanding, was able to organise a new room for us within 5 minutes. We really did not understand why it had taken nearly 5 hours to sort this out. We were really disappointed that we had to follow up twice ourselves. We had planned to go for a swim in the pool but instead found ourselves waiting around the hotel for a call from reception. We never received any explanation as to why it took an extremely long time or why we were never contacted. We felt we did not get to enjoy any of the facilities of the hotel on the Sunday as we had to wait for a call that never came. 
Given the poor night’s sleep from our first night stay we decided to get an early meal in Enniskerry and have an early night. Overall we feel we paid a very high price for a very poor service and a very disappointing stay.",1,2017,01,11
217,Beautiful christmas getaway,"Stayed with my Mam for one night after Christmas to enjoy some of the spa treatments and have dinner . 
Booked a suite facing the mountains which has breathtaking views. 
Ordered room service which was ok but food not amazing especially compared to the last time I stayed . Dinner in the sika restaurant is a must, staff are excellent . Steak dinner was delicious . And desserts are to die for ! 

Spa treatments are really special . They have great offers on but well worth every penny . Will most certainly return again this year . Love this hotel ! ",5,2017,01,10
217,Fantastic Hotel...loved the breakie! (Beware- pay for spa),"From the moment you enter the lobby to the the comfort of the bedroom you feel the luxury of this hotel. The bathrooms are huge, with his & hers wash basins, shower, lol & bath! 

Dinner was yummy. Enjoyed a risotto. Breakfast had a lovely spread & everything was fresh & tasty. We had breakfast on the upper level so it was beautiful watching the sun rise 👌🏽 

Plenty of parking & staff are helpful. A lovely hotel & wish I'd had more time to really enjoy it! One downside though is that there is a charge to use the Spa, if you're a guest in a firm believer there should not be a charge to simply use the facility that makes it a 5 star hotel! I understand about charging for treatments but certainly not for the spa, knocked a star off my review for this reason alone!",4,2017,01,10
217,Most special hotel experience of my life thanks to the staff,"I have just returned from a business off-site at the Powerscourt hotel where I had a bedroom booked to do some business planning.  I had asked for a room with a view of the mountains as this relates to my business.  Unfortunately the room - although lovely - was quite dark for me to be able to sit and work in for a day and a half.  When I explained this to the staff at reception, they were very helpful about rearranging a suitable room - in particular Brian - who found me a more suitable room straight away. 

 Unfortunately when I went to the room it didn't have a mountain view which was entirely my fault as I had forgotten to mention this again (as I had done when initially booking).  I returned to reception feeling pretty uncomfortable about asking to change AGAIN but Brian could not have been nicer about it.  He showed me two different rooms and gave me the option between them.  The room I chose was absolutely perfect for my needs and set the ideal environment for me to do some quality thinking, reflection and planning for my business.  

Later that evening - after several hours of non-stop business planning - a knock on the door revealed a member of staff with a plate of chocolates with a hand written card wishing me luck with my work and hoping the chocolates would provide some inspiration!  I couldn't have been more touched.  

All of this and the attitude of every member of staff I came into contact with throughout my stay genuinely made my experience the most special stay I’ve ever had in a hotel – either in a personal or professional capacity.  

So a massive thank you to all the team for creating such wonderful memories for me during the last 24 hours.",5,2017,01,09
217,Could be a great experience but does not meet the mark,"Started the visit with afternoon tea, food good but staff were rather unfriendly. We had requested a high chair, but found that there was only one which was in use. We managed to get this when those guests finished and left but no interest from staff in cleaning it for us to use.
We checked in at 3.15 but were reminded at the desk that rooms are not available until 4pm. We were then delivered our room keys while we were having afternoon tea. No 'show you to your room' as in most 5* hotels. Room was lovely. Breakfast was busy and short staffed. A queue at the entry while the one person at desk shows guests to their tables. Nobody came to take our order from the menu, but the buffet was fine, but too bad if you wanted something special. The tables around us were left with dirty dishes for the entire time we dined, looks terrible and not very inviting to look at while eating.
Although check out is 12midday, housekeeping arrived to our room at 11.15am.",3,2017,01,09
217,Powerscourt Made Marriott Magic,"We went just a bit south of Dublin to spend an evening in Powerscourt Hotel.  You can use Marriott points here (about the only place in Ireland), and should drain your account...or credit card...to do so.  The rooms are large and lavish with very fun techno gadgets.  We had an incredible balcony, even though it overlooked the top of a parking garage if you looked down, and this didn't bother the view.  It was huge and extended the massive room to outside.  The staff was very friendly, even for the notoriously friendly Irish.  They made you feel like family from the moment you entered.  The rooms were clean and did not show wear and tear.  We had lovely weather, which makes everything better, but would make this a repeat experience even if we had to go out of our way to do so.  There are walking trails, biking - it's magic.",5,2017,01,08
217,Afternoon Tea ,Visited here the 22nd of December for afternoon tea with friends 😁 Absolutely beautiful hotel and our Waiter Martin was just simply one of a kind. Thank you Martin for a beautiful day and for been so nice x ,5,2017,01,08
217,Perfectly relaxing,"We had a lovely two night Christmas break. Very welcoming staff and a lovely Christmas display in reception area made us feel very comfortable. Our room was large, clean and very quiet, very relaxing. We made good use of the lovely pool and sauna etc. Overall we had a great stay and got to enjoy lovely walks in winter sunshine.",5,2017,01,07
217,The Business,"From start to finish this was top class. Service from all staff was exceptional. Facilities were first rate and room was fab.  This is Irelands top hotel without a doubt. If I was to have a moan, the coffee @ over eur5 and same for kids apple juice were very steep. At 25 a head the kids meal was expensive too. But it truth the staff were just so good that it is hard to argue too much when you see what they offer. We ate in silka and the bar, both very good and same with breakfast. Loved our stay",5,2017,01,07
217,wintergolfwonderland,"even it it seems odd to go on golfvacation to ireland in january, it actually was a great idea. and staying at the powerscourt hotel was just wonderful: the suite spacy and immaculate, not only big but huge; breakfast and roomservice offering great food and an attentive and always friendly staff made this stay extraordinary. sure we will be back. already i am thinking about july. 😊",5,2017,01,06
217,A great hotel for families,"We recently stayed here for one night with our three children 8,6,2. The hotel is fabulous with so much to do nearby. We visited the Waterfall nearby which was enjoyed by all.  We will definitely be coming back. The pool was great but if there was one downside it was that children can only use the pool at certain times during the day",5,2017,01,04
217,Worth a visit,Thoroughly enjoyed our nights stay here recently. Hotel rooms are well equipped and spacious. Every staff member we encountered were very friendly and helpful. The hotel and the grounds were immaculate. Stayed with our two children and found it very child friendly. Spa and pool very relaxing. Would definitely stay again. ,5,2017,01,04
217,Fantastic,"Stayed here on Dec 28th. Fabulous place. Beautiful grounds. 

All the staff were exceedingly friendly. The food was good and the rooms were very nice. 

I would highly recommend this place. Just make sure you have a good up to date GPS if you do not know the area. ",5,2017,01,04
217,A perfect hotel,"There are zero faults with this hotel. It is absolutely stunning. Large beautifully decorated rooms with amazing bathrooms and extremely comfortable beds. So clean and tidy and lovely views from the hotel room.

The swimming pool and spa is so nice to relax in and unwind. The ambiance is perfect. 

The breakfast has so much choice an high quality food. 

The staff are friendly and helpful and greet guests with warm welcomes. 

This is my favourite hotel in Ireland and I will definitely be back. 

",5,2017,01,03
217,An unforgettable experience,"We stayed there for a Christmas break and the experience was truly unique. Perfect rooms, incredible SPA facilities, amazing food, all surrounded by a wonderful scenario. Christmas dinner was fabulous, although the desserts could be improved. Staff were always friendly and helpful. There was a little problem with a lost jacket and some reluctance from the staff to give it back to us, and we ended up having to go back to the hotel some days later to finally get it. But apart from that the service was very good. The whole Christmas package was wonderful and not even too expensive, we would definitely recommend it and we are looking forward to staying there again.",5,2017,01,01
217,Amazing hotel ,"This hotel is incredible and a great location for a short break away a very short drive from Dublin. We stayed in one of the suites which was exceptional. The bathroom was fantastic with a television in the mirror. A minor issue we had was that this television randomly turned on early in the morning but it wasn't a big problem. The bed was very comfortable.
We ate in the Sika restaurant which was delicious. 
Can't fault this hotel at all and we really can't wait to return!",5,2017,01,01
217,"Beautiful Hotel, Wonderful Service and Lovely Grounds","My husband and I stayed here with a group from his company this past September. The staff was amazing, the grounds and hotel were beautiful and the service was top notch. We stayed in one of the suites, it was breathtaking. It's nice that the hotel is a short drive (approximately 30 minutes to Dublin). I highly recommend staying here if you are coming to Ireland. ",5,2016,12,30
217,3 night stay,This is a great hotel set in a beautiful location on the edge of the Wicklow Mountains and about 15 miles south of Dublin. The rooms are very pretty and spacious and the spa is delightful. There is a nice looking golf course close by.,5,2016,12,30
217,Beautiful Hotel,"Stayed in this hotel the night after our wedding. It's a beautiful hotel, very lavishly decorated and the staff were excellent, so friendly and professional. We were given a much appreciated upgrade to a suite, which was so nice we never even left the room! We had visited before and had spa treatments and afternoon tea and thoroughly enjoyed both. Would absolutely recommend the hotel, for the opulent rooms, amazing views and extremely professional staff. ",4,2016,12,30
217,BEST CHRISTMAS BREAK WE EVER HAD!!!!,"Just come back from the most amazing Christmas family break  we ever enjoyed, staying at this outstanding hotel.
From the minute we arrived and Craig took all our luggage, we knew we would be looked after, reception had everything spot on and we were quickly shown to our jaw dropping, beautiful rooms.  Mince pies, mulled wine, hot chocolate all there to enjoy in the foyer, while admiring the lights, trees, enormous ginger bread house and blazing fires. Every little detail was thought of, first class food, music, Santa Claus bearing gifts for the children, crackers, such a high class hotel, yet the the staff managed to make everyone feel at home, adults and children alike, even providing food for Rudolf and wearing Christmas Sants Hats.  As 4 adults, we spent time relaxing in the thermal suite at a very small extra charge so worth it to chill out.  The Christmas eve buffet was wonderful, an incredible selection of food to choose from, so hard to decide what to have, the desert selection was a dream trip for a sweet tooth.  The choice was incredible and the beautiful food displays were a credit to the skills of the chefs at Powerscourt Hotel.  We loved the pool and gym, to work off all the food.  The walks in the area are enchanting.  We choose to have Christmas day dinner in the Sika restaurant, with another delicious selection of dishes on the menu.  We had drinks in the Sugar Loaf Lounge and McGills traditional pub.  The dress code at the hotel was more relaxed than we expected which meant if we wanted to put on the Christmas jumper, instead of the party frock, that was ok, even if someone else wore a suit, the mix just seemed to work and no one concerned themselves to much about it.  We want to thank the staff for all your hard work, giving up part of your Christmas, so we could enjoy ours.   Already, we want to stay again next year.",5,2016,12,29
217,Sheer luxury in absolute paradise,"My friend had considered Powerscourt for her wedding venue. Unfortunately she chose somewhere else but my husband and I decided to stay whilst we were over visiting and WOW are we glad we did!

Before you even step foot in the beautiful lobby or luxurious rooms you're greeted by a stunning building surrounded in Ireland's most beautiful countryside. 

I have to say the place was so breathtaking it was borderline intimidating but that soon changed when you stepped into the lobby and we're greeted by the most professional, polite and friendliest of staff. 

Our room was sensational! On the 6th floor in the centre directly overlooking Sugar Loaf Mountain. I'm not sure if we were upgraded but it was incredible value for money! We had specified a high room so it definitely pays to suggest that in order to get the best views.

Going back to the room... every little touch was just magical and made the whole experience feel incredibly indulgent. The bed was like no other and I credit it to the best nights sleep I've had this year!

The husband and I had a wander around and the grounds which were gorgeous (we ran out of time but will be back to explore more and of course to see the waterfall!) we also stopped for coffee in the Sugar Loaf Lounge - a divine spot with floor to ceiling windows overlooking the mountain.

We didn't sample breakfast unfortunately as we had to get up for our flight but can only imagine what we missed out on. 

The food generally looked pretty pricey but only what you would expect from a 5 star hotel. 

I loved every moment and will be begging the husband to take me back - otherwise I'll take myself! ",5,2016,12,22
217,The point in making a booking is...?,"Let me start by saying that I am also one of the ( warranted ) disgruntled people below. 

I am not going to repeat what has already been said suffice to give my view on this: We were given a room as a birthday present for my 60th birthday, and we were all so looking forward to the experience. To prepare to stay overnight, we have to organise a caretaker for our dog, something our Neighbour gladly did. But She had to cancel another arrangement to facilitate us. In addition to this, my Wife had to be excused from weekend work ( as She states below ). And of course Our Daughter was so looking forward to this. 

But what happened? Well, it seems there was an issue ( which NOBODY has stated what the issue was with a 11 month booking, AND a confirmation 5 days prior to our going to the hotel ). So perhaps I might ask now, what was the issue? Also, I notice no apology from anyone here either. Yes the hotel wanted to courier us to another hotel 10 miles away, but maybe someone can explain how this would work when 3 of the Families have young children of various ages.

I have submitted 2 comments for this hotel in the past, both with a 5 start rating, and IMHO, rightly justified.But now, through the 'actions' of the hotel, I ( unfortunately ) have to give the hotel a 1 rating, when a 0 would be more apt. I have stayed in 3 & 4 star hotels all over the world ( Bangkok, Johannesburg, Cape Town, New York & Boston to name a few ) and have yet to come across a double booking...until now.

From hero's to zero with 1 phone call!",1,2016,12,21
217,Good but you get what you pay for,"Lovely weekend away, expensive but worth a treat p, very isolated so you are there for the duration, we had a nice room lovely place for a treat but bring your own bottle for a treat in the room before dinner",4,2016,12,20
217,Amazing property with a charming location and excellent amenities,"I've stayed now three times at the hotel, each time a better stay than the last.  My most recent stay saw me in a lovely corner suite with a large bedroom, sitting room, one of the finest bathrooms I've experienced in a hotel, and a vanity closet.  The rooms are well appointed and complemented by luxe wall coverings and beautiful moulding and one-touch settings for lights, drapes, and climate.  The breakfast is superb.  I recommend finishing your evening with a visit to the pub.",5,2016,12,20
217,Another amazing experience at The Powerscourt Hotel,"Our 12th visit to Powerscourt Hotel and Spa - yet to be disappointed!

From the moment you pass through the gates of the beautiful Powerscourt Estate in the Wicklow Mountains beside the picture postcard village of Enniskerry, its just magical.

The staff are so friendly, well-trained and eager to help.  The hotel itself is built into the hillside so it never interferes with the views from outside.  It's clear no expense was spared when the hotel was designed and built about 15 years ago(?) 

The spa facilities are extensive and the treatments and therapists will have you overspend your budget every time. the Couples Treatment is expensive but you come away knowing its well worth it. 

Dont miss the Sikka Restaurant and the great wine list.  we found the menu very appealing and the price, albeit four star, was reasonable for the haute cuisine.  The generous and immense breakfast buffet will keep you going all day, even if that includes a run, cycle or a walk though the hundreds of acres around the estate.",5,2016,12,19
217,Double booked - again!,"After holding our office party for 3 years in Powerscourt Hotel, we decided to have it again in 2016.  So emails were sent on Jan 25th 2016 to book for 6 rooms and dinner for 17 people.  All booked,  no issues.  A few changes were made to the booking in June 2016 and yet again all fine.  i received the Confirmation emails  on Sunday 11th Dec for the rooms,  I called on Monday morning to go through the final details with reservations, everything was booked and everyone was looking forward to the stay on Sat 17th Dec.  
i received a call on Thursday 15th Dec from a member of staff saying they couldn't take us and we were booked into another hotel at least 10 miles away, they would transfer us for the dinner in the restaurant and back to the other hotel after.  
If we had wanted to stay in that hotel I would have booked it  on Jan 25th 2016 instead of Powerscourt.  My family has stayed in this hotel many times, Christmas Parties, New Years Eve (for 3 years) and a birthday this year (where in the spa I was also double booked and waited an hour to be called - no one came and I had to go to sort it out myself - they did not charge me for the treatment - but it wasn't what I had booked).  
So on Thursday 15th of Dec, two days before our party, I was told they had a corporate client that took precedence over my 11th month booking and  both myself and the MD argued our point and we were told there are no rooms for us and if we turn up on Saturday you will be transferred to the other hotel.   This is not acceptable - they did note that we are loyal customers but this didn't really matter to them in the end -  the office party was cancelled and the weekend ruined for everyone.   No reply from management to this comment will matter to me,  the damage had been done and it will be a long time before we visit Powerscourt hotel again.",1,2016,12,18
217,Christmas Getaway,"Another amazing stay at the Powerscourt Hotel. From the moment we arrived every staff member we came in contact with was polite, cheery and professional. Our suite was amazing and so comfortable, the perfect space for a girlie night away. We had cocktails and dinner in McGills, which were amazing and again the staff were so attentive. We will definitely return, the staff are a credit to the hotel, we can't praise them enough. ",5,2016,12,16
217,perfect hotel!..perfect engagement!,"Booked this hotel as I was proposing to my girlfriend and wanted to make it a memorable occasion. With the help of concierge Robbie, it was an amazing weekend we will both never forget. After a call with Robbie in the week prior to our stay, i had a number of options of how i would like to pop the question and decided to go with the room..although having walked the gardens during the day, this would also be ideal as they are beautiful.
The room was unbelievable(complementary upgrade to a mountain view suite)! Two bathrooms, walk in wardrobe, sitting room, 2 plasma TVs, 6 foot bed, large bath, separate shower area and a TV built into the mirror of the bathroom! We also had a large balcony area which looked onto the grounds of the hotel.
The staff were great also, from our arrival to our departure. We arrived to the Sika restaurant that evening and were greeted with a glass of champagne to toast our engagement. The food was perfect and the service could not have been better. 
We cannot wait to return in the near future to enjoy everything Powerscourt has to offer on a less stressful day for myself! 
Thanks again for making our stay so special!",5,2016,12,15
217,Very Very Very Disapointed,"I have been looking so forward to staying at the hotel, we have had a confirmation for 6 months of our booking.  We were told by the hotel that the have double booked.  i have never been so disappointed. How Can A Customer Be Treated Like This.",1,2016,12,15
217,Badly Treated,"I have booked our company party for Saturday night along with Rooms, to receive an email that they have double booked and they don't have rooms. They are adamant that if we turn up there will be no rooms, they may be in for a shock when we arrive. I have my full reservation numbers.  If I didn’t turn up I am sure they would charge me for the rooms.

I have been a loyal customer to the hotel while every year we have our Christmas party there.",1,2016,12,15
217,Nice hotel but lacking something...,"There is no doubt that this is a very good hotel. It's a 5 star hotel and lives up to this status throughout. The setting is beautiful and the rooms are well equipped and provide guests with the right amount of luxury. My issue is that the hotel feels a little cold and unwelcoming. For example, a simple open fire in the lobby would create a center piece and a warm and welcoming feel. Since this hotel opened I really hate the fact that there is not a nice bar only a faux Irish pub. The lobby bar is just mediocre, so much more could have been made of it. We ate at the restaurant and the food was very nice. I especially liked the breakfast. My room was huge and pretty cold. I was given a room equipped for disabled guests so perhaps that's why it was so big. Good for a business night away but I would never stay here as a couple!",4,2016,12,15
217,The type of hotel Bond would stay in,"I had a great experience,i cannot find one fault with the place, I was greeted by a lovely host , Jennifer Hewitt , she made my stay as comfortable and had answers to all my questions. ..even got me into a decent room on short notice.. lovely place , lovely stay",5,2016,12,13
217,"Beautiful, relaxing stay with amazing service","I truly loved this hotel. The location is stunning and so convenient for outdoor activities. I went for a morning run and saw the most beautiful sunrise over the countryside. Convenient for tours of Wicklow, Powerscourt Gardens and golf. The rooms are beautiful and spotless. The service was perfect; everyone was so friendly, welcoming and accommodating. I had emailed the concierge ahead of time for help organizing some activities and he couldn't have been more helpful. The food was delicious. I would recommend having a car for a stay here; we used cabs and the hotel was very helpful in organizing that but it would be easier with your own car. I sincerely hope I will have another chance to stay at this hotel; it was fantastic in every way.",5,2016,12,12
217,Fabulous one day stay,"My three friends and I enjoyed our overnight stay immensely. Check in was welcoming and efficient. Our rooms were spacious, spotless and relaxing. Food was delicious. Staff were fantastic, friendly and so willing to be of assistance. The hotel was beautifully decorated for Christmas. My sincere thanks to Robert Smyth and the team for a 5 star experience. We will return ",5,2016,12,11
217,I want to live here,This place is A1 all the way.. I can't begin to say how much I loved this place.  About 25-30 mins by car away from Dublin lies this beautiful resort full of greenery and a golf course along with beautiful grounds... I didn't want to leave.  Everything is 5 star all the way.  If you need to go into town the driver will take you into the small village.  Ended up taking the bikes out one day and rode down the river walk which was cool.. I wish it was a tad warmer so we could've done a picnic on the grounds.  The restaurant was nice as well with fresh ingredients and a view of Sugar Loaf Mountain... I did a spa package.. I think it was the Retreat it was 2 hours of bliss... Then I was escorted into the serenity room with my cup of sorbet overlooking the fountain with my avoca blanket on... Can't get any better than that... I really hope that I will have the opportunity to stay here again one day... I could just stay at the resort the entire time instead of even going into the town of Dublin..,5,2016,12,09
217,"Very nice hotel, attentive staff",We stayed in this hotel at the end of our Ireland trip and it was lovely.  The staff was extremely helpful in positioning us for an early morning flight and for getting us to a nearby gas station to fill up the rental car.  Would consider staying here again on a return trip.,5,2016,12,08
217,Pure Luxury,"We spent one night here in this luxurious hotel.  The actual hotel in its setting is fantastic when you arrive.....and inside doesn't disappoint. The decor is first class and the attention to detail is second to none.

All the staff are very helpful,  professional and a credit to the hotel.

We relaxed in the Sugar Loaf Lounge of the main reception area and had some lunch.  Nice place to watch people come and go about the hotel.  The menu was limited, pricey, but very tasty.

The room we stayed in was tastefully decorated and big with a separate dressing room.   All facilites and mod cons.  Our view was to the front of the hotel which is mainly the car park (i'd call it the back as the other side of the hotel is spectacular and looks over fields and trees etc)

The spa was massive!  It wasn't busy at all and we made use of the pool (with Swarovski Crystals inlayed in it!) , jacuzzi, sauna and steam room.  

One small issue we had was that we wanted to dine casually,  so on arrival we asked what the dining options were? We were told we had the option of going to McGills bar which suited us.   That evening when we arrived down at 8.30pm we were told there was a private function and the bar was closed.  Communication could have been better between the staff to save us running about.

All in all a fantastic, top of the range, luxurious hotel and well worth a stay!",5,2016,12,07
217,Wonderful anniversary ,Celebrated our anniversary here recently and once again it was a wonderful stay. We got a lovely suite once again we superbly looked after by Agnieska who left a lovely token in our room. Spent some of our morning at breakfast talking to her also and she really is a sparkle in the dining room and in many ways one of those people who are the true heart and soul of the place. The staff in general were very welcoming and professional as they always are. It's a very special hotel that means a lot to us and every stay is as enjoyable as the last. The only disappointing thing was that Christmas was not up in the hotel. This weekend last year we were married here and I was disappointed that they had only begun to set up Christmas on the Monday we were leaving . ,5,2016,12,05
217,This is our favourite place for a getaway,"We usually visit here at least 6 times a year, the service is great, the rooms and the walk amazing. One of the major highlights is the spectacular breakfast. Will be sure to head back soon. Our kids love the pool, even though there are certain times the the pool is adults only. Make sure you head over to powerscourts house for some shopping and lunch.",5,2016,12,04
217,We went for a wedding ,"I rang ahead to see if room was ready I was told it was but we arrived to be told no room.. the staff were so unhelpful.. they told me I didn't ring I showed them the number on my phone to be told it wasn't there's I rang the number for the staff they said they didn't know that ... had to get ready in spa ... room was nice . But breakfast was a disaster we had to get in line when we got table eventually the service was terrible..I will not return here ever ... 
",1,2016,12,04
217,Amazing on every level ,"I can honestly say I have never stayed in such a beautiful hotel. The staff are so friendly and polite . The grounds are breathtaking and the hotel beautiful. We were looking enough to say in a suite , which was out of this world . ",5,2016,12,01
217,"Fantastic location, great quality hotel","A lovely hotel - very classic and traditional with open fires and dark wood furniture in the lobby areas.  Amazing views.

The rooms are huge, lots of wardrobe storage and very traditionally furnished.  Somewhat at loggerheads with the technology panels that control the lights, along with other mystery symbols which I never figured out what they did.  Beautiful bathroom with double sink, separate shower and bath.  Could not locate the hair dryer for the life of me, there are two mirrored cabinets either side of the sink, but you wouldn't know they are there.

As I was on business, I didn't really get to sample any of the facilities, but this is clearly a quality hotel.",4,2016,11,30
217,Outstanding stay for our business meeting,"Thank you to all at Powerscourt for a truly fantastic stay at your hotel for our conference the weekend of November 18th. Nothing was too much trouble for you, everything went off without a hitch -- and we have had fantastic feedback from our  -- I know we were a demanding group at times, with such an international team many requests were made on you -- however all aspects of our meetings, dinners and team building were handled expertly and we felt in such safe hands at the hotel at all times. I have worked with many properties over the past 20 years globally and have to say, this team are the best of the best -- I can highly recommend this property for both business and pleasure, looking forward to bringing a group back in the not too distant future and will also encourage my husband to book us a private trip too 😃. I can't remember everyone's names (which I feel freaks full about) but must give a massive shout out to the fab Gina & Jen in Sales who helped me scope out our weekend for us, the absolutely amazing Jens Flugge Director of Events and Wizard of everything (we will be back to haunt you) Aidan and his great team, Martin in the Sugar Loaf Lounge, I could talk to him all day, The unassuming Mantas who saved our life with last minute requests and overseeing our meeting, the fab receptionists and the rest of the great team there. To any events coordinators thinking about bringing a group here DO IT and feel free to reach to me if you would like any further feedback. Best wishes to all at Powerscourt and again a  massive thank you to all. 😃😃",5,2016,11,30
217,Back to luxury,"Great to be back at the most beautiful hotel and staff in the world.  Each time I go back there I experience pure joy and excitement.  The staff are just wonderful.  The rooms are just the best and decorated in the most lovely style and elegance.  I always smile with the TV in the mirror, but it is after all a fabulous touch of opulence.  There are 84 TV stations from every nation on the planet from many Turkish and Russian, Arab, French and many others.  Oh, Sky sports too.  I watched Ireland beat Australia there - wonderful.  Later we had the most incredible meal in the famous Sika restaurant.  That restaurant is a wonderment with the food choice being just perfect.  The meal was everything we expected, the wine just so perfect and to top it off the desert was out of this world.  I brought 5 guests with me and everyone of them loved it at Powerscourt.  Well done again and thank you to the greatest staff ever and a hotel unmatched anywhere in the world.",5,2016,11,29
217,"Excellent, Excellent, Excellent","This was our 3rd time staying in this fab hotel, it is pure luxury, the rooms are beautifully decorated and really spacious , you even get a tv in the mirror of the bathroom, we got upgraded to a suite, really special. Breakfast is great. We had dinner in Powerscourt house , the food and service was excellent , if you are looking for a wow factor for a corporate function, this is the place !!",5,2016,11,28
217,Serenity and calmness,"My husband and I had a 2 night break at Powerscourt hotel recently . We really enjoyed our stay. Room was large and  beautifully decorated. Bed was queen sized and extremely comfortable. High spec tv.  We ate both nights in downstairs bar. Food was of a high standard. Spa area was gorgeous. Lovely pool. The only complaint I would have is that a 5 star hotel should have full breakfast menu from kitchen and not served in buffet style . I am referring here to scrambled egg, sausages etc .",5,2016,11,27
217,"Very nice, a bit snooty","The rooms were huge and lovely with tons of storage.  This would be a great place to spend a long vacation.  The hotel was clean and beautiful.  Restaurants were good but with sometimes inconvenient hours.  The staff was a little snooty and slow to help, as though this would make the place seem fancier.  With a warmer staff, this place would have been nearly perfect.",4,2016,11,26
217,Birthday treat,"The ultimate in relaxation this is definitely a place to visit..for birthdays couples friends romantic get aways the works.. 
Staff couldn't be more professional and helpful hotel has so much to offer in ways of food from the elegant restaurants the cosy bar , afternoon tea or just room service to the suite their attention to detail is fabulous. 
Pamper yourself in the spa take a dip in the pool or walk around the grounds breathtaking views and beautiful location and gardens .

Highly recommend this hotel will definitely be back .",5,2016,11,24
217,"""Amazing Hotel just outside Dublin City, Amazing Location, And the Staff were Brilliant""","This place is just amazing, it's pure get away from the busy lifestyles we all live, from the moment you arrive at the entrance of the hotel, you can just chill out. All the Staff we come across were amazing very polite & helpful. And a special mention to a guy called Andrew at the Reception when we checked in, he was very helpful & professional, an absolute gent, & a credit to the hotel. 

I chose this place for my mothers 70th Birthday surprise, so there was 6 adults and 3 kids, and they accommodated us all amazingly well, and couldn't do enough for us. My mother had the best time ever and she loved every minute of her surprise stay, with all the family.

The spa area is just amazing, we loved every minute of it, and we totally made use of all the facilities on offer, and we all felt bloody brilliant after it. The swimming pool & chill out area's are just brilliant to unwind, and forget about everything, the restaurant & lounges over the grounds are just amazing on a sunny day.

We had a fantastic meal in the hotel restaurant, they were so accommodating to us, and the 3 course meal we all had was just fantastic. If I lived near by I would go there just for a meal, on special occasions. 

Breakfast is just so nice, they have a full range to chose from, and I wanted to try everything they had on the menu. Worth waking up to in the morning.

The rooms, are so big, clean and very tidy, the beds very big and very comfortable, and had a great nights sleep, the views of the garden/grounds is just perfect, I will definitely stay here again.

And the whole area of Powerscourt is well worth a visit",5,2016,11,23
217,Fitness and Spa Centre,"Spa treatments are excellent. Beauticians very well trained. Hygiene and treatment rooms very well maintained. Overall, a great experience and good value for money given you can access the whole fitness centre as part of the package.",5,2016,11,23
217,Stunning hotel,Stayed here for a surprise visit with my boyfriend as part of our engagement - it could not have been better! The staff were so friendly and really made the whole occasion so special! Will definitely be returning in the future.,5,2016,11,22
217,I Will Be Back!,"Absolutely fantastic for anyone who wants to escape for a weekend and relax. This hotel is fantastic and I have recommended it to everyone! Our hotel room was outrageously beautiful! The View of the mountains was divine with our own private balcony. Both restaurants were lovely with their own themes.
If you are thinking of going here. Stop thinking and book it!",5,2016,11,21
217,Anniversary ,"What a beautiful hotel with a lovely atmosphere. The staff are amazing and are what made our stay so special.

We were so spoilt because it was our anniversary and they went out of their way to make it special. 

The room was amazing and so big and the bed oooo my god you could fit 5 adults in it. 

The steak in the bar food was to die for. I could not fault Powerscourt at all. It's a very special place. It is expensive but worth every penny and we will be back. ",5,2016,11,20
217,Noise and bad service ,"Stayed for one night and we were woken up at about 4am with a lot of hammering going on. Thought it would stop, it didn't.  After nearly an hour we called reception to complain, said they would check it out. Didn't hear anything back hammering still going on. 
Eventually at about 6 we checked out as we couldn't sleep. We asked at reception why nobody sorted it out and we were told that they investigated but couldn't hear anything. 
I found this very hard to believe as had someone stayed more than a minute they would have heard the noise. Given the usual 'we'll inform the manager' so we left. 
Bad experience ",1,2016,11,18
217,Sheer Elegance,"Powerscourt is where we return to when we need a total luxuary escape. From the beautiful leavy drive through Enniskerry my sense of anticipation rises. 
The hotel is sumptuous yet understated. The staff are the perfect combination of attentive, professional and personal.
The rooms ... even the standard ... are beautifully equipped.
We have been fortunate on several occasions to have a corner suite allocated ... these are basically apartments ... without a kitchen.
The pool and spa area are calming and luxurious. The Espa products are a lovely extension to the facilities.
Breakfast is amazing. 
McGills pub downstairs has a very traditional informal atmosphere. Food also very good.
This is my haven on earth.
I want to come back again ... already.
We love the golf courses on our doorstep.
Excellent quality and very accomodating staff.
Avoca and gardens and more .....
This place has everything.
",5,2016,11,16
217,Lovely hotel but pool not welcoming to families with kids ,"Beautiful, hospitable hotel, great food but visit to pool left very sour taste. Pool attendants not friendly to parents with kids. We were curtly told by a male attendant that the pool was for ""swimming-only""  and we were to stop lifting the kids up in our arms and letting them splash into the water (during the kids 2-hr window!).  So we got out and didn't return.  It seriously lets down the rest of this lovely hotel for families who want to relax and enjoy down-time with their kids. It would be better to make the pool adult-only if this is the pool ethos.  Really spoiled our time there and left us feeling unwelcome. It lets the entire hotel down. ",1,2016,11,15
217,Short getaway,My friend took me hear for pampering session .after iv had major surgery.l loved it from start to finish.i had a facial  which was great.i certainly would recommend to my friends. Staff excellent. We had afternoon tea n scones servers name was Martin he was exceptional with his service. ,5,2016,11,15
217,Afternoon Tea @ The Sugar Loaf Lounge,"In one word - stunning!! 
The setting, the view, the atmosphere, the staff, just excellent. Amazing selection of sandwiches (the ham was the best) and perfect choice of dessert! Our waitress Kasia was very pleasant and ensured that we wanted for nothing. 
We would highly recommend this place!!  ",5,2016,11,13
217,Superb venue for leisure or business,"Stayed for two nights for a business conference. Food, staff, facilities and location were fantastic and faultless. Even the weather smiled on our meeting but the grounds and location work in any weather. Walking and golf are first class nearby and there is even an Irish pub to complete the experience. ",5,2016,11,12
217,Fantastic !!,"I attended a business event in this fantastic hotel.  I looks very prestigious, the rooms are amazing, the staff is wonderful.  You must take a look at the swarowski swimming pool.
Best hotel I stayed in Europe.
",5,2016,11,12
217,Perfect end of trip!,"We stayed here for two nights to revisit the Powerscourt Gardens and Glendalough. Hotel is fantastic with a huge room, huge bathroom, dressing room. Touch pads to control temperature, lights, etc. We overlooked the back garden. Great food and drink in McGill's Irish Pub.",5,2016,11,10
217,Perfect venue for a business meeting,"I could have given it 5 stars but in the end only gave it 4 because they committed the cardinal sin - they gave me room keys that did not work when I went to the room. You know what it's like when you are tired, been travelling, just need to get to bed? Second time lucky they fixed it.

The hotel is absolute luxury, and the business meeting we held there went without a hitch. Thoroughly enjoyable.",4,2016,11,09
217,Powerscourt Hotel ,"Powerscourt truly is a 5 star Resort, it has it all.
I have stayed here many times and each time the service is impeccable.
The hotel grounds are breathtaking with the beautiful Wicklow mountains surrounding, especially this time of year,the Autumn colours are stunning.

The bedrooms are spacious and the beds are xtra large with super super soft bedding. Everything at the touch of a button.Marble decorated  bathrooms with rain shower and large bath tub, heaven.
Includes all of your toiletries with twin wash basins.
The large mirror in the bathroom has a television screen, you can bathe and watch some tv all at once.
The bedrooms have a great view of the Sugar loaf Mountain.

The spa facilities are fantastic, from the hamman suite which is always at perfect temperature to the relaxing lounges surrounding a Swarovski crystal lit pool, pure bliss.                 

The lunch served here at the spa is delicious, healthy and just the right amount.

The gym comes fully equipped with a stunning view of the Sugar loaf while you work out. 
Good pumping tunes in the gym, water dispensers and towels available.

I have written about the Spa separately under the heading Powerscourt Espa, check it out. 

I've previously eaten in the Sika restaurant in the past so decided to give Mcgills pub a go, the food was very tasty with a good variety on the menu and reasonably priced.

Breakfast in the Sika restaurant was a huge self service buffet a full Irish, many other hot options together with a selection of fruit, juices,homemade pastries, breads and muffins, a superb selection. 

The food and service was premium as you would expect the staff are super friendly.

Powerscourt is an excellent base for hiking,exploring, or relaxation and has the very best scenic surroundings for locals or tourists,if you are staying here to explore Dublin be sure to give yourself plenty of time to enjoy the facilities and hotel surroundings.
Highly recommended. 
",5,2016,11,08
217,"Beautiful location, excellent service","A large group of us came here for a family member's special birthday. When you walk in to the lobby and see the Suagr Loaf Lounge in front of you, it is magical. What an atmosphere. 

Service (in person) was excellent throughout. Over the phone, it was less so. Requests were slow to be actioned (or weren't actioned at all in the case of an issue with the spa). But when you were dealing with people in person, they couldn't be more helpful. 

Rooms are huge and very impressive. Could have spent a week there. 

Cocktails in particular were delicious and can't fault any of the drinks we had - great wine lists and whiskey selections. Food on the other hand was lower quality than I'd have expected for the price and the star rating. It wasn't bad, just not befitting its cost and location. You would be better placed going into Enniskerry for cheaper and better food. 

Overall, it was a lovely experience and a wonderful stay in a beautiful part of the country. I had a great time and cannot wait to return!",5,2016,11,07
217,24 hrs of relaxing bliss,"A beautiful hotel with all the benefits you would expect. The perfect spot for 24 hrs of r&r. 
The room was large with plenty of space and the breakfast room was beautifully  laid out. The spa and pool areas were spacious and done to a great standard. ",4,2016,11,06
217,Lovely stay....,"Just after staying here and I have to say..all in all we had a lovely stay. Very nice atmosphere, very nice room, food ,people etc.... Swift check in also which I like. 
Just two little things that picked at us so just wanted to inform hotel to maybe consider. 
Firstly when we entered our room there were two items, a Coca Cola bottle from previous guests left on bathroom floor and a girls hair accessory left in room.
Not a major problem but wished they weren't there.
Secondly...we went to Mc Gills pub after dinner for a drink which was nice but there was an AWFUL smell throughout the pub from the oil in the kitchen part of pub. Very off putting I thought. Maybe close kitchen door or something else??
Anyhow....these are minor as we did have a very pleasant stay...but just wanted to inform hotel . We had a lovely time but unfortunately it's these little things that stick in your mind. Wouldn't put me off going again though I have to say...👍",4,2016,11,05
217,Home away from home ,"This property is one of the best and so we try to visit a couple of times a year. However....on arrival we checked in, brought our bags up to the sumptuous room and decided to sample the delights in the bar. On arrival into the bar, there seemed to be an altercation between the staff members and their floor manage, the atmosphere was terribly uncomfortable and unprofessional. Due to the bad feeling in the air, the staff were really unfriendly and could care less about our order! We persevered and ordered our drinks at the bar, and all was well in our minds.
The restaurant was as brilliant as always and the atmosphere in McGills was as always. Can't wait to go back, but hope that the staff have resolved their differences :)",5,2016,11,05
217,Powerscourt Hotel,"This autograph Hotel is the best possible option in the Wicklow. Hotel surroundings are beautiful green and unique. Excellent location if you are looking for a quiet romantic vacation as well as a great place for business events. Staff are very helpful and service is at the highest level. Rooms are very spacious,  comfortable and will meet all your requirements..",5,2016,11,04
217,21st Birthday Pressent,"Loved the experience!! It was great to finally get the chance to stay here as We often wondered would it would be like. We decided we'd stay for my 21st and we really enjoyed every minute of it! We were greeted by very friendly staff who showed us to our room. He showed us how the room worked lights, air con, Curtains etc all by a touch of a screen built into the bedside locker. The king size bed was huge and very comfy. The bathroom was big and spacious with 2 sinks a bath and walk in rain shower and a cool built in TV screen into the mirror! The room also came with a huge balcony, mini bar/fridge and walk in wardrobe. It also came with very handy little extras like bottles of water, Slippers, soaps, shampoo, face cloths, dressing gowns etc which was very handy as most hotels don't do that anymore. Room service was Great as you got to choose from a menu on your TV screen and then it being brought to you on your own little dinning table on wheels with a heat box to keep your food warm! The only problem we had was we thought the food could have been better.. and was hard to get plain things..  for the price on the menu your paying it was a let down.. I did also notice a couple of stains on the nets of the curtains from some hand prints which needed to be cleaned, dirt around the door to the balcony but most alarmingly there was white dust and debris along the grooves and mouldings of the wooden headboard, the 2 velour scatter cushions and matching platform valance were grubby and badly needed upgrading and also there were splashes on the wall in and around the toilet.. all and all tho we enjoyed the experience and would stay again in a heartbeat but still feel that really your only experiencing the remains of the 5 star hotel that it once was. Standards would appear to be slipping.",4,2016,11,03
217,Birthday night away,"My boyfriend booked this hotel as a birthday gift . The grounds leading to the hotel are beautiful . We were greeted by a lovely guy who took our luggage for us , the reception team were very friendly and welcoming. We were brought to our room and helped with our luggage . There room was really spacious with a living area , a desk if you need to do some work . A king size bed , that was really comfortable. The bathroom was the best part , two sinks , a large bathtub and walk in rain shower . There was a tv built into the mirror so you can watch your favourite programmes in the bath . There's a control system beside the bed , touch screen to close the curtains and dim or switch off the lights Also controlling the air con . The balcony was huge the only downside was a shared balcony so anyone could walk out and look in your windows . 
The Irish bar is lovely , not too busy but there was a great atmosphere. We went for dinner in sika restaurant , it is perfect if you like fine dining . I personally would not return to the restaurant as I'm vegetarian and there's only two options which are both risotto , unfortunately I don't like risotto . There was not much on the starter menu that we liked but our server was more than happy to offer us something else . Very warm and cosy , piano music , candle lit and very romantic . 
The spa is beautiful , the espa products are amazing , I had a facial and the therapist was very informative of skin care . It was very relaxing . I didn't use the pool as we didn't have that much time , my boyfriend says it was lovely but very busy that day . It was a Monday morning so I can imagine it's very busy on weekends . 
One thing I really did not like was , just before we left while I was getting dressed , a man knocked but didn't wait for us to open the door he knocked and immediately walked into the room to check the mini bar . I was really uncomfortable with the fact I was changing at the time and he didn't apologise . We told reception staff and have spoken to a manager . 
The other downside was we needed a late check out due to the spa appointment being so late , but they would only give us until one o clock . We would be happy to pay the extra , but they refused us any longer . Which I think for the expense of it all they should allow for a later check out . 
Breakfast was brought to our room which was delicious. 
Overall you can't beat the customer service , the cleanliness , the views and the hotel itself . It's relaxing and perfect for a spa escape or dinner and drinks but maybe put the chain on the door so housekeeping can't barge in . ",4,2016,11,01
217,A whole other world,"From start to finish our visit could not have been more wonderful.  Everyone we came in contact with at the hotel could not have been more pleasant, charming, or helpful.  Gorgeous suite, dined in both the hotel restaurants and were very far from disappointed, magnificent grounds and surroundings..",5,2016,11,01
217,"Very beautiful property, just hard to get to city center","My family and I stayed here for 6 nights at the end of September.  This property was gorgeous .  The rooms are very large, and updated .  The entire hotel staff is incredibly friendly and very accommodating . And the breakfast buffet is delicious !
 One of our only problems was that we were under the impression ( booking with travel agent- not with hotel itself) that it was very easy to get to and from the city center             ( Dublin) from the property.  Since we had our child with us, we were looking for something quiet and low- key but still wanted to get to the action fairly quickly.  
That wasn't necessarily the case.  It was difficult to get a taxi ( needed at least 30-60 min notice- sometimes longer).   And the taxi drivers weren't crazy about taking us back to the property at the end of the day/ night.   It would have been nice if the hotel itself offered a shuttle to and from the city center a few times a day.",4,2016,11,01
217,I Wish Had Stayed Longer,"I wish we had planned to stay longer. The Powerscourt Marriott Autograph is an absolutely beautiful property.   This was our last night in Ireland and I was looking for a quite place to rest and relax prior to taking our flight back to the USA the next morning.   Jackpot!  If you want to get away from the hustle and bushel of downtown Dublin, but still be close to local activates, this property may well be for you.  This hotel is quite, in a beautiful area, and the staff is top notch.  The hotel grounds and interior are very pleasing and well maintained.   Within minutes of checking in the staff contacted us to see if our suite met our standards and if there was anything we needed.  Our suite had about a 160 degree patio and windows,  which gave us a beautiful view of the property,  mountains, and garden area.   If you enjoying walking and observing nature  you will enjoy this property.  You could walk for miles especially if you take a walk on the 18 hole golf course.  Our suite (621) was well furnished, clean, with many nice to have amenities such as, separate sleeping area,  separate powder room for the wife,  one and 1/2 bathrooms, separate office and dining areas as well as two smart televisions.   We cannot attest to the pool, exercise and spa areas as we did not observe or utilized them.   But, if they are up to the same standards as the rest of the property, and I have no reason to think otherwise,  they would have to be a pleasure to use.   When we return to Ireland there are two properties in which we would go out of our way stay at again and the Powerscourt Marriott Autograph is one of those properties.",5,2016,10,30
217,Relaxing In Luxury,"We stayed in Powerscourt Hotel for two nights (a Saturday and a Sunday). We stayed here as I was working nearby and wanted to finish of two months of hard work in the most relaxing way with some of the most beautiful scenery around and it doesn't get much better than Powerscourt. Even the drive up through the avenue is breath taking (Especially this time of year). The hotel it's self is magnificent. Very grand with a beautiful grand classic interior. The suite we stayed in had a mountain view of the sugar loaf, the forest and the Wicklow mountains. The room is very spacious and the bed highly comfortable. The bathroom however, was my favourite. 
With the Powerscourt Estate Gardens just a quick walk away you won't be stuck for things to do. On Sunday morning we went for a walk around the gardens and a nice lunch in the Avoca Cafe they have. The gardens are very picturesque with all the autumn leaves falling and the pet cemetery was very interesting too.
The breakfast the hotel gives is a delicious buffet in the Sika restaurant overlooking the gardens (again it's all about the nature views for me). My only complaint about the food - dinner in the Sika restaurant, as a vegetarian the options are not great, we paid a very big price for some risotto. The starters and the desert (OMG try a chocolate sphere, it's AMAZING!!) were delicious. 
The pool area, leisure rooms and the spa are top quality and very relaxing! The pool is very modern with a dark / sleek interior which makes it great for turning off and unwinding.
We have been here before and we will be back again.",5,2016,10,28
217,Friends visit ,"Stayed here for one night midweek . Lovely large room, beautiful views. Unfortunately the night we stayed, midweek, was very quiet so there was a lack of atmosphere. The barman could have been more friendly . The light system in the room did not work . The computer inside the bedside table only operated the loud Airco. We had to pull all the plugs out of the sockets as the switches on the lamps were not working either . 
",3,2016,10,26
217,Only regret was that we could only stay one night!,We were fortunate to have a suite and it was lovely from the word go.   It was actually four rooms and more space than we could need  but enjoyed every inch of it.   Setting is lovely and the staff couldn't have been nicer.   The spa is absolutely lovely but we were unable to book an appointment as it was full.   I would recommend that you call ahead for appointments.,5,2016,10,25
217,FINNimaje photography wedding by JASON J FINNANE,"This was my fourth or fifth time to shoot a wedding here & it hasn't lost its magic, it's probably one of the luxurious venues I have ever worked in with Powerscourt gardens situated next door also giving photographers a world of options. Top class A1 in my book for sure!",5,2016,10,25
217,Absolutely fantastic!!,I cannot speak highly enough of this hotel. Our jaws dropped at the elegance and beauty of the hotel and grounds plus the hotel staff was fantastic. The room we stayed in was hands down the nicest room we ever saw at a Marriott property. We also ate at both the pub and the fine dining restaurant and both were great. You really don't even need to leave the hotel. This place is worth every penny and we will absolutely stay again. ,5,2016,10,24
217,Work Conference,Was here yesterday for a work conference. What a stunning hotel and a stunning location. Soup and sandwiches were provided and everyone I spoke too raved about them. A great location and a great day and it has definitely made me want to come here to stay!,5,2016,10,22
217,Disappointing,Was looking forward to a 5 star experience but unfortunately it didn't really happen. Room and bathroom were excellent but everything else was just alright. Had heard wonderful things about the hotel from a relative who stayed a couple of years ago but I get the impression that standards have slipped since then. Would I go back? If someone else was paying I wouldn't complain but for myself I'll certainly be looking at what else is on offer in the area. I'm sure there's better value to be had elsewhere.,3,2016,10,22
217,A Must stay,"We stayed two nights and wished for more. I is a luxury hotel with a price to match but we had outstanding service and room. I do think the Pub and restaurant are over priced but the food was excellent. Located about 3 km from the nearest village. A few good restaurants or pubs there. In the end it all boils down to cost. If you can do it then do it, I don't think you will be disappointed. The grounds and gardens are beautiful and if we return I will have my golf clubs to play the golf course.",5,2016,10,21
217,Exceptional hotel don't miss it,"We stayed 2 nights and it was just wonderful. We have stayed in many places around the world and have never experienced anything like it.  The grounds are huge and the view from every room spectacular. Great dining options from casual to fine dining.  We ate at the Irish pub downstairs both nights and it was great food. Beer on tap included local beers. Breakfast was really nice. Best scrambled eggs in Ireland which is saying something when it comes to hotel food buffet. 
Would highly recommend a stay here. The rooms were best I have seen with marble bathrooms, dressing room plus brand new flat screen TV's in the lounge and bedroom. Lounges are so comfortable which is also hard to find in a hotel. ",5,2016,10,21
217,Beautiful ,Just home from an amazing time in this hotel. What a fantastic place. Grounds are absolutely amazing a fantastic time of year to visit stunning colours. Just lovely. It's been a long time since I've been there definitely will be back. ,5,2016,10,18
217,Heaven on your doorstep!,"Took a short break to Powerscourt without realizing the quality of our destination.I have stayed in Castles all over Ireland but this place topped the lot.We had a magnificent suite,the food was superb and the gardens breathtaking.This place is truly an experience you won't forget.",5,2016,10,18
217,Is there such a thing as a six star hotel?,"There are not enough superlatives in the English language to adequately describe the Powerscourt Hotel.  From arrival to departure everything was perfect. We drove from Dublin airport following the website directions which were spot on.  We normally get lost.  The staff had a room ready for us by 10:00 AM even though check in is listed for late afternoon.  Really important after an overnight flight. Dinner one night at Sika and the other at McGills.  Two very different yet most enjoyable experiences.  Even when we had a problem with the heat, it was remedied within an hour and a manager sat with us to explain what the engineering staff was going to do.  The gardens are magnificent.  Although somewhat expensive, the hotel is well worth the cost.",5,2016,10,18
217,Upgraded without asking,"We were attending a wedding at the weekend at Powerscourt House, a five minute walk from the hotel. We were facilitated with an early checkin, as we needed to shower and change. Without asking, we were given a very large suite, which was quite literally the best we have ever been in. A small carp would be that the bar in the hotel closed at 10.30pm, probably because the demographic that uses the hotel is not ""into"" the Irish pub scene, so to speak - the lobby and bar area was practically deserted, at that hour. Possibly for the same reason, the standard of Guiness was not up to scratch, either. That said, all of our family really enjoyed their stay and the luxury was worth the prices paid.",4,2016,10,18
217,Amazing,My sister & myself stayed for 2 nights. We were upgraded to a suite which was the nicest room we've ever stayed in. Spa treatments & facilities were amazing. We ate in Sika both nights & the food & service were second to none. The breakfast choice was superb. We had a beautiful afternoon tea with a stunning view of the mountains. Chocolates in the room & at afternoon tea for my sisters birthday were a lovely touch. All staff we encountered were wonderful. Can't recommend highly enough!,5,2016,10,17
217,Beautiful Estate,"The room was lovely and spacious and the hotels amenities are great - used the spa and loved it! Was told on check in we had breakfast included, so we went and had a cup of tea and toast and then on check out the same guy tried to charge us for two an extra £40 and argued that he'd never said we had breakfast.... found him rude and we would have just had tea in the room had we known they would cost £40! 

Overall beautiful hotel and I frequent the spa now as its not to far from home and the relaxation room bliss!",4,2016,10,16
217,Fabulous hotel in the Wicklow Mountains,"My wife and I were invited to a 3-day business conference at this hotel which had the reputation of being the Gleneagles of the ""Emerald Isle"".  The setting in the heart of the lovely Wicklow Mountains ensures wonderful views from many function rooms and bedrooms too. The property was developed in 2009 and managed by the Ritz Carlton group but has since moved across the ""Autograph"" sector of the Marriott group. Service proved reliable and professional despite staff being drawn from so many different countries and cultures. Our suite on the 6th floor looked out over the woods to Sugar Loaf mountain and provided wonderful views. A large patio with table and chairs afforded the chance to enjoy the clean air and complete silence. The suite had a large sitting room with desk and extra powerpoint in a drawer, flat screen TV and comfortable furniture. There was a separate closet for hanging and storing clothes and a separate bathroom with WC and washbasin. The bedroom featured a really comfortable Kingsize bed, with large flat screen TV and access to the main bathroom with walk-in shower, separate WC and huge bath plus two washbasins. The luxurious nature of this suite was complemented by the electronic boards which controlled all lighting, aircon and movement of the large floor to ceiling curtains. Bliss !  Much recommended.",5,2016,10,16
217,Fabulous Rooms,"Our room at the Powerscourt was gorgeous! It had every amenity--the bellhop had to give us an overview of everything.  One could easily stay here for a long time. 

The breakfast buffet was extensive with lots of appealing choices. It was harder to order something from the menu though. 

We didn't get to use the spa but it looked beautiful.  

Lizette was most helpful with helping us plan our activities when our original plans were rained out. 

We did have an issue with our bill when we got home and saw that we were billed in US dollars rather than euros. ",5,2016,10,15
217,Really nice hitel,"Stayed here for just the one night but everything about the stay was top class.
From the check in, the quality of the dinner and service, the staff, it was top notch stuff. Room was very comfortable and cosy. Mcgills bar was great for a nice pint. 
Didn't get down to the pool or leisure centre but maybe next time. 
Highly recommend. ",5,2016,10,15
217,5 star all round!,"Stayed here for my birthday and couldn't fault it. Staff, grounds, spa and food were all top notch. I had the ribeye steak which was incredible.. Would highly recommend it for a special occasion. Will be back!",5,2016,10,14
217,Fantastic hotel,"Loved this hotel. I stayed only a couple of nights on a business trip but the room was incredible, the little Irish bar makes you feel like you aren't in a hotel which is great and the surroundings are fantastic for walking. Didn't get a chance to try the pool etc so can't comment but will certainly look to bring my wife here for a leisure trip.",5,2016,10,13
217,Gorgeous Spa Day!,I try to visit the ESPA spa here every year. It's my favourite spa in Ireland and I've been to most of the popular ones. I was most recently here in September and the ladies (particularly Michelle and Laura!) too great care of me as always. The facilities are beautiful in particular the relaxation area which has stunning views of the sugarloaf. I also had lunch in the spa cafe which was included with my package. The lunch is always delicious and comes in a cute little bento box. The treatments are top notch and I always leave floating out of there. I've promised myself next time I'll stay over to see if the accommodation lives up to the spa!,5,2016,10,13
217,Fab!,"I stayed here with two of my friends for one of their birthdays. All staff were extremely friendly from the moment we checked it. We also got an upgrade to a suite which was one of the nicest rooms I've ever been in. Breakfast is great as well, as is everything else in the hotel! Will defo be back ",5,2016,10,12
217,AMAZING ,"Hands down one of the best hotels in have ever stayed in. The spa and pool are the most relaxing places on this earth. The staff from top to bottom were amazing. Breakfast was an experience of its own. .. the restaurant food was also amazing
 Can't wait to return...",5,2016,10,12
217,Jewel of Ireland,Grand hotel with fantastic grounds and top notch service. I must say however that the hotel is beginning to look long in the tooth in a few areas. The rooms could use a bit of a touch up. The curtsey car was a bit confusing. A client was staying at a sister property down the road. The first day the courtesy driver told us the service was available 24-7. Imagine our surprise at midnight when we were told the car only ran until 11:00PM. Good luck getting a cab because its not worth drivers spending 1/2 hour to get there for a 7 euro fare. Minor issue but noted. Golf course is magnificent.,5,2016,10,11
217,A Perfect Sunday ,"I recently visited the hotel for afternoon tea with a close friend. When we arrived in the lobby we were greeted by our host Jose who promptly showed us to our fabulous window table overlooking the picturesque Sugarloaf mountain. He thoroughly explained what delights we should expect from afternoon tea at Powerscourt and his warm yet professional manner set the tone for the rest of the afternoon. 
We were then greeted by our server Melinda whose attentive and pleasant nature ensured we got the very most from our experience. The combination of staff, culinary delights and beautiful surroundings of Powerscourt hotel left us feeling utterly relaxed and content. We could not have asked for a better afternoon! ",5,2016,10,10
217,Tips for a perfect romantic stay,"This is my favorite place in the world.  I  travel here for long weekends from Seattle.  It's worth the trip. Start with a quiet dinner in the Sugar Loaf restaurant.  The next day, go for a picnic,  using the hotel golf cart.  It's just $35, for a half day. They provide blankets. Cozy. The picnic basket is very generous,  so you can share the meal for one. Get a bottle of wine,  but bring glasses from the room. The plastic glasses they provide broke immediately.  Go for a swim in the super sexy pool, I am 55 and hate to be seen in my bathing suit. No problem at all. The pool has night club lighting. It is fantastic. That night for dinner, go to the very cool Irish pub. Take the 5 minute walk to the gardens, next door. The gardens are rated #4 in the world. Book everything in advance. The hotel is popular.  ",5,2016,10,08
217,Brilliant One Night Away,We live in Dublin and escaped for one night without kids and had a fantastic time. It was helped by being told on arrival we had been upgraded to a suite.  Firstly the staff were wonderful - really excellent - very friendly and very professional.  The spa area was lovely - pool was great and the steam room / jacuzzi was fab.  We then had a really lovely meal in the Sika Restaurant - I will be dreaming of the yellow fin tuna for many weeks ! Breakfast was also lovely with a great buffet with lots of fresh fruit.  We live in Dublin and it was great it felt like a three day break even though it was on 24 hours !!,5,2016,10,08
217,Stunning in every sense of the word,"What a first impression! This was our first stop in a trip that includes places like Ashford Castle and Kilronan Castle. I was blown away by the staff, the cleanliness and the candor of this facility. Despite its stature as a high star hotel, the Irish charm was on full display. The staff was helpful at all times with luggage, requests, etc and happy to answer a myriad of questions. Other than the grumpy woman swimming laps in the pool and stopping to give us nasty looks if we dared get in the way of her swim, (not the hotels fault) this stay was a dream!",5,2016,10,06
217,Amazing property!,"Large Stunning rooms with touch screens in mirrors, large deep soaking tub which my wife is in right now. This is such an amazing property with stunning landscapes, lots to do, pub on property , golfing and hunts,  very friendly staff loved it!",5,2016,10,06
217,Fabulous,"Stunning hotel in a beautiful location. Stayed for 2nights. We had a meal in bar on the first night which was fine. We watched the first 15mins of liverpool 
/ Chelsea match in the bar with no sound& decided better to go back to room to watch which is a shame! Breakfast on our first morning was fantastic! Staff attentive& lots to choose from the buffet. The waitress served us coffee, offered toast& asked if we wanted to order off menu.(we didn't but thought we'd try next am)
Next morning we were sat down at our table for breakfast& asked if we'd like coffee.  Helped ourselves to buffet& waited and waited on waitress to come to order toast& menu breakfast. Nobody came near us& we sat and sat trying to get attention! Eventually we had to shout 'excuse me' until a waitress took notice. we got sorted but not good enough for the money we paid! 
We had a 5 course meal in the restaurant which was fantastic food I couldn't fault.  The flavours were amazing and the presentation a work of art.The waiter was very attentive throughout until we asked for a coffee.....we waited over 20 mins& when it came the cup was that hot we were surprised it didn't melt the metal spoon!!! Never in my life have I been served coffee past boiling point! After waiting 20mins we had to wait at least another 10-15mins before the cup could go near our lips!!!.again not good enough for a so called 5star hotel. Our room was huge and luxurious, separate bedroom, walk in wardrobe, huge bathroom with tv built into mirror (amazing).  The spa was fantastic and treatment a luxury.  My negetatives are minor and would not put me off going back.  It was absolutely beautiful and I should have voiced my opinions to staff when there but we are not the type of people to complain",5,2016,10,04
217,Absolutely stunning !,"First time in Dublin and staying for 2 nights in room 533. Wow what a wonderful hotel! Here for a 2 day convention and amazed by the beautiful location, wonderfully decorated rooms and impeccable service. Cannot wait to visit again for a long weekend with my wife. Only downside is the air conditioning that is relatively noisy and above the bed, but for the rest I am truly amazed at this hotel. If you play golf (which I don't) you will be truly impressed so don't hesitate; go for it!",5,2016,10,04
217,That 5th star is losing it sheen,"Came here in August 2015 for our 25th wedding anniversary and were blown away. Yes it's expensive but we did get what we paid for and enjoyed everything. Returned this last week because we decide to make it an annual 5 star treat. 

The space is still beautiful but some not so little things really let the space down. The views are still stunning - the lobby area and afternoon tea are still top class BUT the rooms leave a lot to be desired. They are grubby and stained - and I don't mean little stains but ground in dirt that resemble blood spots. The corner area of our suite looks as if Chucky the Doll had gone viral on the floor with with his knife - gouged to pieces. 

We made our feelings known to the duty manager on the first night and were robbed off with - ""we are renovating the hotel floor by floor"" - not good enough when your are paying for the experience that we had in 2015.

The hotel was exceptionally busy with a number of conferences and on our last evening we had wanted to eat in the pub downstairs which is a great ""pub"" space and I wanted to watch the football match. When we descended to the pub - Ian the bar manager who is by the way exceptionally good at his job - apologetically informed us that the pub was booked out for one of the Confernce groups. This was completely unannounced and no advance warning given during the day - again not good enough - we were offered an extended lunch menu in the lobby area - again not good enough. The football match concerned was on RTE 2 which was not broadcasting in the rooms - so I missed the match - again not good enough when you are paying top dollar. 

The spa area and pool is still stunning BUT the little things needed to addressed quickly.",4,2016,10,01
217,Not all that,"A really top end hotel, beautifully layout and thoughtfully decorated to the highest standard.  If you like golf and being fussed over by the staff, this is the hotel for you, if you can afford it of course.",4,2016,09,30
217,WEEKEND BREAK,"We booked this hotel on recommendation from a friend who had stayed there and we can say that we have never stayed in such a first class place-ever!
From the minute we arrived the efficiency of the staff was excellent-from the concierge to reception and restaurant/bar staff they couldn't do enough for you. It was extremely clean everywhere. It was quite expensive but in this case you get what you pay for!
We shall definitely return.",5,2016,09,30
217,Concierge Exceptional,"I'll start with what was fabulous... and that was the concierge. Robbie was a particular highlight always friendly and eager to help. They had great recommendations and were terribly well organised. Credit is due to this team! 

Our suite was spacious and clean and the McGills pub was lively and pumping with a band playing classic tracks when we arrived late on a Friday night. First impressions were very good! 

However there was a couple of let downs. The lobby bar (sugar loaf lounge as they call it) was a little disappointing. Whilst the entire place was empty we were still told we couldn't have a table by the window. Which is a little disappointing for hotel guests. The food was very average and wine menu wasn't fantastic. 

The spa also is in dire need of a spruce up. It was not relaxing, nor clean nor an Espa. 

Being familiar with Espa, I was expecting much more and this was a huge disappointment (so much so that I cancelled my treatment for the following day). 

Overall I would say this hotel is a 4 star, not a five star and should start pricing itself as such. I get the district impression The Marriott is trading off the former glory it had when it was a Ritz. 

Despite the above, I still thoroughly enjoyed my time there. The hotel is in a beautiful area and the people are simply wonderful!",4,2016,09,28
217,Truly enjoyable!,"We spent the last night of our Ireland vacation at this lovely estate. The service throughout was very good especially in the lounge and in McGill's Pub .The grounds and gardens were beautiful and our room was exquisite. This was the perfect ending to a great vacation! Ireland is a clean, beautiful country with very friendly people.",5,2016,09,28
217,Some changes but still great,"Last time we stayed here 5 years ago it was the Ritz. Now it is the Marriot and you notice it.  The changes are small but when stacked up noticeable. It is very crowded and busy with lots of bustle and kids, especially in the pool, spa area and lobby. We were very pleasantly greeted upon check in and were able to check a bit early to a room on the lobby floor. We noticed that the hallway rug was stained and the hall smelled on fried fish from the lobby restaurant. The room was nice with a view of the back fountain which wasn't on but  no view of the mountain. However it was very clean, large and I love their marble bathroom and dressing area room which gives a family of 3 plenty of room to spread out even with a cot with the king bed. The room was also quiet and convenient.. Great soundproofing!! The gentleman at the front desk sent up a plate of chocolate for our special anniversary which was very thoughtful and hadn't been done at any of the other 3 hotels we stayed at during our week in Ireland. We took out the loaner bikes and loved riding on the private trail as well as down to the Estate and Gardens. Some things that need improvement to get them back to a 5 star hotel....
-the rose garden was overgrown and not cared for at all
-service was NOT 5stars- we waited a lot and sometimes were never helped like returning the loaner bikes to the bellhop, getting table service in the pub and were ignored at check in by bell service when the bellhop with the very short haircut never brought our bags up even when we went to the lobby and took them ourselves.  He said he couldn't find our name and didn't know what room we were in. 
-free morning coffee was available downstairs but we were never told and when we happened upon it one morning, everything was depleted.

Overall I'm glad that we returned and love the Wicklow mountains and being on the same property as the Powerscourt Gardens and Estate. It's a beautiful area although much more crowded in August than our last teip in Sept. I like off season more. Hope to come back and that they make a few tweaks to perfect it again. There were lots of young children due to summer.",4,2016,09,27
217,What a treat!,"I have stayed in some wonderful hotels, but Powerscourt is in my top three. The property is beautiful and in a beautiful setting. The service is excellent, and the staff is outstandingly friendly, helpful and knowledgeable. Our room was at the end of the hallway, and it turned out to be a full suite with a sitting room/dining room/office. There was a balcony with table and chairs that provided a fabulous view. The bedroom and bath were luxurious(double sinks, large tube, waterfall shower, robes, etc). There are two lovely golf courses and formal gardens. The restaurant in the hotel is called Sika, and it was absolutely elegant in appearance, service and food.",5,2016,09,27
217,Afternoon Tea - Average for the price,"My family booked me afternoon tea for my birthday recently. Being from Dublin i have tried many of the afternoon tea's on offer from hotels such as The Shelbourne, The Merrion and The Westbury. My family had issues before with afternoon tea here but i was keen to try it out. It took a few minutes to be seated, even though some staff walked past us. we were seated at a lovely table but took over 15 minutes to be served by anyone. Tables who arrived after us were served before us. The food was good and the tea was nice but that is about it. downsides were my scones were burned on the bottom and when i picked my dessert from the menu, I was told one of my choices was out of stock, but then the table next to me was being served what i would of selected. Restaurant was cold and a little dated. Big shame as i really love the hotel and the gardens.",3,2016,09,26
217,Took 4 days to resolve A/C issue; otherwise nice property,"So I'll start off by saying I really wanted to like this hotel.  The interactions with the staff, especially the bellman and the concierge were exemplary.  What differentiates a 'luxury' hotel from the rest, though, is the service and remedying issues when they arise.  

I spent 6 nights at the property in early September.  The room was nicely presented (with just some minor issues like some build up on the shower head and a little noticeable mold), but it was uncomfortably warm and humid in our room.   We let the front desk know and they wrote it down and said they will take care of it.  The next morning we woke up sweating at 6am and followed up with the front desk (different person).  They said they would take care of it.   When we got back that afternoon, the room was still warm and we alerted the front desk again.   Do you sense a pattern here?   So, long story short, after FOUR nights (and 5 separate visits to the front desk including the last at 1am), our issue was finally addressed and we were offered the opportunity to move.  We also learned that they have an A/C system that is run off cold water and typically shuts down from 2-6 AM. 

So, it's Ireland, not Florida, and I don't expect them to have industrial chillers, BUT I do expect them to remedy or explain what is going on after I alert an issue.   We literally woke up 4 mornings in sweat and only found out the above information then.  

There are some positives from this property.  The breakfasts were excellent.   The grounds are immaculate.  But at the end of the day, it took too long for my issue to be resolved and while there were apologies after the fact, I was offered 10% off for 3 nights.",3,2016,09,23
217,Close to perfection,"As Marriott Gold Elite members we certainly appreciated the upgrade to Classic Suite. Room location, view, cleanliness, bathroom, shower, etc were all well received. Bell staff was phenomenal, especially Eoghan (Owen). Spa was an added bonus and staff at buffet breakfast were quite courteous and professional. Dinner in Sika was sublime though we think just a tad over-priced but not much. The grounds and location, next to Powerscourt Gradens & Estate are devine and courtesy car availability to town of Enniskerry a delight. Concierge services were delivered with precision and graciousness. ESPA facilities included were very nice including indoor pool, hot tub, sauna and crystal steam room.
Now for the few negatives that keep us from scoring 10. Some inconsistencies with housekeeping. Discovered a wad of hair on the sheets one morning upon waking and don't think it belonged to me. Another day something slightly repulsive was left on the desk top as if cleaning rag was laid down and deposited something. One day at breakfast I ordered an omelette that was never delivered. Check-out process was the worst we've experienced in a long time and really put a damper on the overall vacation. Grossly disorganized, took too long, asked if we wanted charges converted to U.S. dollars which I naively agreed to only to learn it was done at the hotel's inflated exchange rate. Requested that be refunded and the charge put through in Euros which was done but took much too long. Although asked at checkout if we used anything from the honor bar since it was last serviced we said ""no"" only to arrive home to email saying there were apparently items missing and ""if we do not hear from you in 36 hours we will assume these charges stand."" Communicated our disdain for this feeble attempt to gain a few additional Euros and Lezette (concierge) was quick to assure us there would be no additional charges. A most unwelcome ending to an otherwise close to perfect trip.",4,2016,09,20
217,"Fabulous stay, shame about the meal","We stayed here for one night.  It was my third time to stay but the first time for relaxation.  Other stays were at a wedding and a conference.  We were greeted at reception by a very pleasant male receptionist who told us we had been upgraded to a suite as a result of the hotel being very busy.  The suite was amazing and the hotel itself has stood the test of time very well.  We relaxed over a drink in the foyer and then went to the spa.  It is fabulous and immaculately clean.  We had dinner in the Sika restaurant.  This was the only let down of our stay.  The menu was quite limited.    Two of our party ordered the beef cooked medium to well done, however it came out cooked medium and was sent back, leaving me with my main course, which I sent back as I did not want to eat alone!  Little apology was offered and the waiting staff had to be prompted to remove the potatoes in their ubiquitous copper pots.  On the upside breakfast the following morning was absolutely beautiful with a huge amount and variety of food on offer.  Overall, the stay was excellent and we will go again, but not opt for a package inclusive of dinner.",4,2016,09,20
217,More than perfect!,"I stayed 4 nights in this fabulous hotel, about 50km far from Dublin and far from everywhere except a golf club. Perfect to enjoy nature, relax, excellent food. The spa is big and nice and clean. Rooms are gorgeous and spacious enough to live in! I'm allergic to dust but I did not suffer, it could mean that is clean although carpets and curtains. Lovely and helpful personnel !",5,2016,09,19
217,Excellent hotel,I stayed here for a wedding anniversary break with my wife. This is an absolutely fantastic hotel with a high level of service. Our meal in the hotel restaurant was fantastic. I noticed that the more relaxed hotel bar seemed to be a very popular dining option too. All in all I would highly recommend for a luxury break. ,5,2016,09,18
217,Fantastic getaway!,"We booked this as a wedding anniversary treat, it did not disappoint. We were treated like royalty from the moment we arrived until we left.

The room was well sized and immaculate with touch screen light and climate control.  Grounds well kept, adequate free parking. Breakfast is definitely worth paying for, not overly busy and a fantastic selection.

The spa area was clean and relaxing, would love to go back. Highly recommended-hopefully see you there!
",5,2016,09,18
217,"Quick Stay, Wonderful Grounds and Staff","Our family recently stayed at this property for a night while traveling around Ireland. Though the hotel is not location in or near central Dublin, it ended up being a great spot for our family.  My wife and daughter relished touring the well maintained and gorgeous Powerscourt Mansion and Gardens.  (Ranked #3 in the world in 2015) They also enjoyed riding bikes (made available by the resort) into the close by Village of Enniskerry.

Our suite was spacious and well decorated.  The Silka cafe offered a robust morning breakfast and delightful experience.  This resort thought a bit out of the way ended up being a great find for our family.  We would highly recommend it and would not hesitate to go back again, if future plans bring us back to Ireland.",5,2016,09,18
217,One of the best hotel stays in a long time!,"We were there for dinner, bed and breakfast at the week-end.Hotel was full.Every point of contact with staff from check in to check out was excellent. Looked after by (I think) Rosemary at dinner which was superb.We booked a superior room which had floor or ceiling windows out onto a balcony with amazing views. McGill's bar was lively with a good buzz and even though hotel was fully booked there was no congestion at check out or breakfast or the usual pressure points.
Spa and pool are well worth checking out.
It may be on the expensive side but I feel I've paid more for a lot less in other hotels. 
The location is fantastic and overall I feel this is a top international hotel in an Irish setting.",5,2016,09,18
217,Didnt live up to expectations,"The hotel room and hotel itself was nice and had a nice view over the grounds. The breakfast was nice but dinner in the lobby was not great, I had the hake and risotto and found it an odd/bland combination. There was also a large party who were incredibly loud and disruptive throughout, I was really surprised that they were not asked to quieten down. I preferred the food in the pub which is nice traditional Irish fare. We didnt eat in Sika as we couldnt get a booking, but the menu did look nice. There was also a large wedding when we were there and it was awkward as they took up most of the hotel and we almost felt like we were intruding! I also couldn't get a reservation in the spa when I rang in advance which was disappointing. The highlight was the falconery experience which is hosted by an external company and organised through the hotel. The experience itself was amazing, I thoroughly recommend it, however the hotel were very disorganised. They did not know if we had to pay in cash, we were sent from the check in desk to the reservations desk to the concierge and back to check in. After panicking that we didnt have enough cash to pay, we met with Brian (hosting the falconery) and he confirmed that the hotel pay him directly and we would be charged upon check out, very odd that no less than four staff members didnt know this when it is advertised and booked with them directly. Overall for what we paid it was disappointing and we did not feel we got a five star experience despite the five star price tag.",3,2016,09,18
217,"Lovely staff, nice hotel but not a 5 star","Hotel is well done and beautiful on the interior.  Set in a beautiful amazing park with stunning views!  Rooms are luxurious and spacious.  A bit short staffed at the front desk.  Limited availability to answer both calls and questions, always a wait.  Both restaurants are nice and food is acceptable.  I would not go so far as to say excellent.  Service in these is hit or miss. If you are fortunate enough to gt Conor as your server at Siki your meal will be wonderful as he is prompt and attentive.  McGills staff is not overly friendly but overall vibe of the pub is adequate.  Hotel and guest rooms are either smothering hot or freezing cold, there is no medium.  Hotel halls are hot and stuffy as rooms may also be.  A good place, just not an overall 5 star.",4,2016,09,17
217,A bit disappointing,"We booked three rooms for a four night family celebration and were  impressed by the grounds of the Powerscourt estate which surrounds the hotel. 

On arrival at the hotel it appears dated and the lobby confirms the impression.  It has the look of a 1970's attempt to recreate a grand manor.  Not to my taste but certainly others would not find it objectionable so this should not be seen as a condemnation of the hotel.

Check-in was quick and polite, as were all staff interactions.  All three rooms were ready with one of our grown children already in residence.  The ""large"" rooms were in the same style as the rest of the hotel and very large with separate walk-in closet, a foyer, a large living space including a full size desk, large bathroom with separate toilet, separate shower, tub and double sinks.  Very nicely done.  

We found the food in all venues to be good to very good.

The disappointment is that the hotel falls short of expectation.

The showers in all three rooms had mould growing black enough to confirm that housekeeping supervision was severely lacking and one room smelled of sewer gas.  These issues were brought directly to management and within a few hours staff had eliminated the worst of the mould and the smelly room was changed.

Further proof of the hotel's lack of housekeeping care is that while the major mould was eradicated the cleaning team failed to look for and eliminate the numerous more minor outbreaks of mould.

These rooms are controlled by ancient first generation touch pads some of which barely work and none are able to control the air conditioning satisfactorily.  

Dining is not up to the standards one expects of a hotel in this price range, although as I said, the food was good.  Weekday evenings there are only two choices.  The restaurant Sika serves ONLY a three course prix fix menu at 69 euro per person.  Or there is a Disneyesque irish pub, dark, purposely grubby and loud.

The much more pleasant lounge bar on the lobby level with wonderful views over the grounds only operates on weekend evenings with a very nice a la carte menu.  During the week it closes at 6:00 pm so if you want one or two courses of slightly more reasonably priced food you need to enjoy dining at 5:00 pm.

Obviously the hotel is economizing on staff as well as the quality of things like toilet paper and face tissue. 

Bottom line, not bad but could and should be much better managed.",3,2016,09,17
217,One night stay for a wedding,"Oh but how we wish we could have spent more time there. The hotel is set in a fantastic location, with excellent facilities, and superb rooms. Had we checked in advance, we would definitely have stayed longer to enjoy it more. Definitely one to return to",5,2016,09,17
217,Late Lunch on the mezzanine ,"We arrived at 4.30pm not having eaten anything since breakfast, so we were quite peckish. We both had a main meal which were cooked to order and excellent, good use of herbs and seasoning. The choice chosen by each of us for our desert was an exceedingly rich and decadent dark chocolate layer cake which was delicious and gluten free. We enjoyed the wonderful vista across the fountains and garden from our window table. A really good pot of coffee finished off the meal.

217,"Classy, serene, luxurious stay","I recently stayed at this property for 3 nights with a friend, it's such a treat. At first i was a bit concerned and perplexed for the location as it is not in central Dublin but it ended up being the perfect spot, not too far from the city and yet you are in a gorgeous setting, the hotel sits in the massive grounds and it's a grand estate, the little village of Enniskerry being very aware of the influence of this Versailles like building. 
From the spacious and well appointed rooms to the full service spa to the bountiful morning breakfast i am positive this is one of the best resorts in Ireland and probably the place to stay when in/near Dublin, i highly recommend it and would not hesitate to go back, if future plans bring me back to the Irish soil one more time!",5,2016,09,15
217,Partaking of Powerscourt Hotel's Pleasurable Amenities,"The elegant splendor of Powerscourt's location is not to be missed.  It is like a gem to behold with its Irish harp monument in the labyrinth and the beautifully manicured sunken
gardens along with an outside chess set that can be enjoyed by the guests.  One will be greeted in the traditional Irish manner  by a welcoming staff who go above and beyond to offer friendly customer service.  Even when a hair dryer was missing from its location in our suite, the staff took quick action to find a replacement and with sincere apologies!!
The signature food fare in the McGills Pub and at the breakfast buffet did not disappoint!  Beautifully appointed decor in the reception area and suites, corridors and staircases to name a few.",5,2016,09,15
217,Expectation management,"Beautiful setting unlike anywhere I've been. Breathtaking. The hotel is grand but it doesn't live up to its luxury positioning. 

Food options were limited. Room service, ridiculous prix fixe fine dining or awful pub. 

Not particularly well maintained. Woke up to odour of sewage in my suite the first morning. Hotel did zero to compensate me. They didn't even offer me a complimentary breakfast to get out of the room. 

Mold problem in the bathroom. Just not maintained. It didn't sprout into a big black mess between me and the last guest. 

For the room rate charged it's simply not acceptable. They should send management over to the Four Seasons to see how it's properly done. It's not my job to make sure the bathrooms are maintained and there are reasonable food options in a hotel that for all intents and purposes is in the middle of nowhere. ",3,2016,09,15
217,Amazing!,"The hotel, rooms and service is from outta space! 
This is a hotel outside of Dublin City, but in Powerscourt everything makes sence. 
It one of the most beautiful places in Ireland definatly.
The hotel offers attractions such as spa and gym, and sometimes they even bring Gordon Ramsey in to do a cooking class.

Fantastic. ",5,2016,09,14
217,Luxury night away..!,"Both my wife & i along with another couple stayed in the outstanding Powerscourt Hotel on the 26th August 2016. I will keep this review short. The hotel and grounds are nothing short of amazing. The staff were very polite & a pleasure to deal with. The double room we stayed in was well equipped with all you could expect plus more from a five star hotel. The food was beautiful. No fault or complaints with this wonderful luxurious Hotel. Would gladly recommend and stay again in the future.
Kind regards

217,Amazing Hotel - Let down by the service,"Stayed from 9-12 Sept. Our suite was comfy, spacious and luxurious. Spa was amazing except for the pool. Too cold to swim in it longer than 5 mins. Dinner on Saturday was let down by the fact the restaurant was so cold my partner had to get my jacket from our room. Asked the waiter to turn off the air-con but my request was obviously ignored. All three ladies that were sitting in the same row of seats were all shivering. Food almost went cold waiting for a glass of wine also- at least 10mins. Breakfast was lovely on Saturday but I'm not sure any of the waitresses even realised we were there on Sunday morning. I had to stand up & walk to the lady at the front desk to ask for tea and coffee, then I didn't even get my coffee. No one came to take our order so I ended up eating from the buffet when I was looking forward to ordering Eggs Benedict. No one brought us toast- even after I asked. Its a pity about the service because I could not fault any of the food. Would think twice about re visiting and spending so much at this hotel. Standard has slipped!",4,2016,09,13
217,Absolutely Faboulous!,"I cannot fault this Hotel.  From the drive up through the Village of Enniskerry, to the greeting as you enter the Hotel, the experience is everything a person could ask for whilst exploring the beautiful country of Ireland.  We decided to stay at the Hotel for a week as it was exceptionally located for daily trips to other County's as well as a day trip to Belfast.  Our Suite is beautiful...the bed is extremely comfortable...the bathrooms are quite large...the view is stunning...and the staff are beyond lovely.  I have stayed at fabulous hotels all around the world...including the Ritz Carlton in Boston and NYC.  This hotel surpasses those for its ambience and its service.

We walked to the village and ate breakfast and lunch on a few occasions.  Delicious food and very friendly people.  The Powerscourt Arms has excellent food and a wonderful atmosphere.  As we had a car, we mostly drove to different Counties and to Dublin for dinner.  But if you don't have a car, no worries, because Powerscourt has a complimentary shuttle services to town and back.

Wicklow National Park is only a short drive fro the hotel.  Beautiful walks and interesting historic 12th century buildings.

I'm returning here with my daughter in 4 months....that's how much I love it!",5,2016,09,12
217,grand!,"This definitely is 5 star, except for McGills Bar. The rooms are truly luxury with a great view. The restaurant is good but not great. McGills - give it a pass!  Bad food, poorly trained staff and dark and dismal",5,2016,09,11
217,Fabulous!,"This was my second stay here and won't be my last! 
The location is breathtaking, just the drive up to the hotel is stunning. On arrival We decided to upgrade to a suite with mountain view, it also had a balcony and as the weather was hot and sunny, this was a great asset. 
The beds are the comfiest I have ever slept in and the bathrooms the most luxurious I have ever used. A couple of pieces of furniture in the living area had seen better days but were still beautiful pieces. 
Breakfast was not included and at €28 each it is expensive. Instead we had brunch at the golf club which is easy walking distance. Lovely views on the terrace over the golf course and good tasty food. 
We did have room service one night which was fast and efficient. All the staff are unfailingly pleasant, polite and a credit to the hotel.
I believe it has just won a best hotel in Ireland award so that says it all!",5,2016,09,10
217,A grand hotel for a special occasion ,"We visited the Powerscourt estate in May. The hotel is absolutely wonderful, the service impeccably Irish! The breakfast was delicious too. But it's the views and the grounds of the estate that are the real attraction. Would highly recommend a night at Powerscourt whenever you visit Dublin next ! ",5,2016,09,09
217,Only thing 5 star is the price ,"Very disappointing stay - will never go back. This place used to be an amazing hotel and the views/grounds still are, but the standards for the hotel have slipped and doesn't offer any value for money. 
We paid €1378 for a 2 night bed & breakfast (no evening meal) and spa package. For that kind of money, we would expect 5 star service and facilities but there were so many disappointments. 
We stayed in one of the 4 Powerscourt suites. The room is nicely decorated but it has a very strange layout - it is very long and only has 2 windows so it's dark even with the curtains open. The windows also look out onto the terrace of the room below and the carpark so there are no views from the room. The only full length mirror was at the front door, very far from the bedroom & dressing room area. The wardrobe had lights inside it but the light switches were broken so the lights stayed on the whole time. The tissues were very cheap & rough... worse than what I've gotten in 3 star hotels and so bad that I brought in my own tissues from the car. You shouldn't have to bring your own tissues to a suite in a 5 star hotel. There was a steam shower in the room that was nice but dark. While taking a shower, I hit a button a few times thinking that would turn off the steam but it wasn't until I finished my shower and opened the door to get better light that I realised I had accidentally pushed an ""emergency call button"". My husband did the same thing. While convenient for us, worryingly the button doesn't actually do anything or call anyone so someone in an emergency could be waiting for help that will never come. The touchscreens for the lighting & curtains were unresponsive and one of the ones next to the bed was missing. The air conditioning barely worked leaving the room quite warm. There was no bottle opener in the kitchen so my husband had to improvise to open drinks from the mini bar. The coffee maker wasn't working on arrival. We requested for it to be fixed 3 times - each time we were told someone would look at it but no one ever came. The hotel's new app doesn't seem to work because we never received the foam pillow we requested via the app before our check-in. 
We also booked a couples suite in the spa. While the treatments we received were lovely, the couples suite was disappointing. It is across from the gym and not soundproof. They keep a towel pushed under the door to try to minimise the noise from the gym machines but then they turned on loud music and my therapist actually had to stop my massage, leave the room and go across the hall to the gym to get them to turn it off. When you spend several hundred on a spa package, you don't expect to have your relaxing treatments disrupted by noisy gym equipment and loud music. 
In terms of the food, we ate breakfast on the 2 mornings plus room service one evening. The room service was quick but very overpriced for what we received. The breakfast however was very poor. The dining room was crowded and the wait to be seated was very long (Monday & Tuesday- not a weekend). The food was just ok and the standard selection - nothing worthy of a 5 star hotel. Both mornings I asked for gluten free toast and the only thing the hotel has is frozen rolls that are just defrosted. 
While most of these things aren't major issues, the fact that there were so many issues during a short 2 night stay speaks volumes and shows how much the hotel's standards have slipped. I don't think the hotel is value for money anymore and won't be recommending it to anyone. ",1,2016,09,07
217,Gorgeous location and hotel,"Visited for 2 nights to attend a wedding onsite.  Check in was seamless and our room on the 3rd floor was huge, clean and well appointed.  Loved the large bathroom and dressing room/wardrobe.  My 5 year old loved the tv in the bathroom mirror.  The grounds are gorgeous and staff are friendly.  We ate at McGills on the first night which was crowded but efficient.  Food was good and well priced.  It was very nosy and not far from our room but you couldn't hear anything once inside the bedroom.  Great sound proofing.  Breakfast was lovely with lots of buffet options as well as a menu to choose freshly cooked options.  Wedding was inside and just lovely.  Party was on the ballroom on our floor, again very convenient and absolutely no sound once in our room.  We had spa treatments and used the pool.  Both excellent.  In room dining was as expected a little over priced but enjoyable.  We didn't get a chance to explore the grounds but would love to return to the area to do so.",4,2016,09,07
217,Lovely few nights of luxury ,"Stayed in the hotel for 2 nights for our anniversary. 
On arrival hotel grounds are beautiful and view amazing. No valet parking which is a shame for a five star. Hotel looks very grand and reception area decor wonderful with fantastic views. Check in was efficient and we were shown to our room by a young gentleman who also carried the cases. 
Room was amazing with a view of the gardens. Had requested a resort view and was hoping for mountain scenery but not an issue. Room had 2 bathrooms, living area, dressing room and bathroom. Tour provided of the room and all gadgets explained. Very clean and high standard of decor. Some dust on the headboard if you wanted to be fussy. Lovely elemis toiletries and very comfy bed. Hotel also provides 3 cornered pillow for myself without my requesting after seeing I was pregnant, and a lovely fruit basket to celebrate our anniversary. 
Breakfast was one of the best we've had anywhere. Great selection of buffet and available to order items including fruit, cereal, cooked, pastry, eggs- delicious. Only negative was toast was always cold by the time it reached the table! 
We had dinner both nights in the pub as the fine dining restaurant didn't offer much choice for pregnancy with many raw or fish dishes. Pub food was gorgeous! Staff very accommodating and even made me mocktails. Nothing was a bother to them! 
We also explored the powerscourt house and gardens which were lovely- unfortunately  you still have to pay into all the attractions in the estate though despite being residents. And spent an afternoon in the spa area- very clean, relaxing and again staff extremely welcoming. 
Would recommend. ",5,2016,09,07
217,"August 24 - 29, 2016","Wow! For our 20th anniversary trip, we booked 5 nights at the Powerscourt, then 5 nights in the U.K. The Powerscourt is truly a hidden gem, as it is not on the beaten, tour bus ridden, Ireland sight seeing path. We elected to make 4 day trips outward, and were very pleased to be welcomed home by the Powerscourt staff upon our every return. We actually booked a B&B across the country in Tralee for one night and were greeted with a welcome home sweets plate in our suite as we came back home to Enniskerry. Being partial to Marriott venues, we have experienced both highs and lows when redeeming points. Our Powerscourt stay is the high upon high in our years with Marriott. We received a 1440 sq foot suite, with a spacious private jacuzzi terrace. Oh, had we only known before hand! Superlatives only are fitting for the staff, from the maid service, to the bartender at McGills Pub. While at first, we were overwhelmed, we quickly acclimated to our good fortune with this resort. Honestly, we felt like royalty, as we were treated as royalty.",5,2016,09,06
217,Wedding party hotel,"I loved this hotel. It was clean, organized , beautiful , and with some of the nicest and most helpful staff that I have seen throughout my travels around the world . The rooms were very modern , quite spacey with grand clean hallways. The room service was done very much on time. The rooms above the 3rd floor all have huge balcony with wonderful view of the gardens. If you are a golfer, the golfing is top of the line and with numerous walking & complimentary bikes for cycling paths it is nature lovers dream. It is a short drive from a beautiful waterfall. The hotel provides drop off & pick up from the nearby village of Enniskerry. We actually walked down the path to the village & called the hotel to come and pick us up. If you are not renting a car, I suggest arranging with the hotel for your pick up & drop off arrangements. We were busy with our coudin's wedding do didn't get the chance to fully enjoy the grounds. So we will return. It was a great experience . ",5,2016,09,05
217,Stunning,"Hotel is outstanding!  Unfortunately we didn't get to enjoy much of it because we had to drive to City Centre to meet friends, and left for our flight early in the morning.  The room was magnificent- large, spacious, and Very well appointed.  Bed was extremely comfortable.",5,2016,09,05
217,A superb hotel... nearly perfect.,"The location of this hotel is stunning, about 25 minutes from Dublin airport, 15 minutes from Bray (a bit tired with a pebble beach) and 20 minutes from Greystone (worth a visit, very nice little sandy beach, lots of cafes and bars). 

The hotel is built in the grounds of the spendid Powerscourt Estate. As you arrive you drive through the grand stone arch entrance and gates to the estate, past beautiful grounds with superb views and a golf course, up to the grand entrance of the hotel.

The hotel is a recent addition to the estate (2007) it has a wide sweeping set of rooms overlooking the grounds of the estate and the mountains in the distance. The views are lovely, although the grounds are spoilt a little by the placing of a large helicopter landing clearing which is ugly and spoils the hotel gardens - I can't believe it needs to be placed where it is, smack right in the middle of the hotel gardens and in full view of all the mountain view rooms. 

The room we had was a suite that overlooked the gardens with a wide sweeping balcony. The room was excellent, with 3 televisions, free wifi, tv safe etc. The bed was very comfortable and all in all it was very luxurious. 

Although considering there were several wardrobes only one actually had any hangers in it. Enough for a short stay but why have wardrobes if there is no opportunity to use them? Perhaps they think guests will steal the hangers? 

Also for a 5 star I was surprised there was no turn down service or second maid visit to replace towels etc. So for a 5 star, it fell a little short on room service - they should make an effort add this service.

The hotel spa is excellent, a great pool (a little cold) and a nice large jacuzzi (not hot enough) but it had a great steam and sauna room, both really hot. The spa was very good with a little more attention to the temperatures of the water it would have been perfect.

The staff and service were excellent particularly at reception and the concierge - the hotel offer a service to drive clients down to the Powerscourt village and collect them after their meal up to 11pm. We were driven in a new 7 series BMW both ways - excellent service. 

The village by the way is really nice, quite small but pretty, some nice cafes, an Italian restaurant and an excellent little pub. Well worth a visit.

There are some nice walks around the grounds of the hotel and estate, the river walk was good, not too long very secluded, and of course there is the actual Powerscourt Estate gardens (although this is a separate charge, but worth a visit). The gardens will take a couple of hours to visit. The Powerscourt Waterfall is also worth a visit - 6 euros to enter, you need to drive to it (about 10 mins) but pretty spectacular in a beautiful setting.

The hotel is definitely worth a stay. 

We ate in the Sika restaurant on one evening the food was ok, not anything special. They didn't offer a steak, but served  roast beef, but it was tough, The service was poor and overall the experience was a bit of a disappointment. 

However my biggest criticism of the hotel was the bar area - or more to the point a lack of one, or an area to socialise and relax with a drink. 

They do have a pub in the hotel, McGills, but it is down on a lower floor, it is very dark and smelled of burger and chips when we visited and was showing football, so was very busy - and in all honesty it's a theme pub and not reflective of the rest of the hotel. 

But the hotel itself doesn't have a lounge bar, or at least not a bar that isn't really part of the lobby restaurant. In here all the tables were dining tables and were covered in a sheet of glass, (probably to make them easier to keep clean), the effect was a bit cheap cafe rather than high class dining, the tables were far too big, so you felt you were too far from your partner and overall were not very relaxing. 

The breakfast is served from the same tables so even though we just wanted a drink the tables always had a salt and pepper set on them and when anyone left their table the staff set them up for breakfast. It totally spoiled the mood and did not encourage anyone to have a drink in the area. 

If you come back to the hotel late on in the evening or before you go out for a meal you want to have a nice relaxing drink not have to sit around dining tables with poor seating and no atmosphere. 

It is the main problem with the hotel, they need to set aside a proper lobby bar that serves just drinks - they've got the space so it shouldn't be difficult. In fact the bar to the lobby dining are would be perfect - just get rid of the dining tables and replace them with small tables and more comfortable chairs, alter the lighting, screen it off slightly from the restaurant tables and hey presto! you have a bar! Simple.

So in summing up I would recommend the hotel for a short/medium stay, mainly because the location and grounds are superb, and the staff are excellent. 

The hotel itself is very good about 95% right, a little formal, but the lack of a relaxing bar spoiled it a little. With a little more thought this hotel could be perfect.",5,2016,09,05
217,Not 5 Star but nice ,Went for one night away with a friend for a little break. Got mixed messages about availability of food and the service in the Sugarloaf lounge was appalling. Reception were not that great either for a 5 star. The staff in the pub and spa were amazing! The bedroom was simply beautiful and spotlessly clean. The food in the pub was beautiful and well worth another visit. Restaurant food was really nice and the service was great! The Spa is very nice and the pool is really nice. The gym is great. Overall a lovely hotel but not 5 star. ,4,2016,09,04
217,An over the top Exceptional hotel,"This hotel is one of the top Hotels I have ever stayed in and we have stayed at many 5 star hotels around the world. This property used to be a Ritz Carlton and it still meets and even exceeds the Ritz Carlton benchmark today. 

The restaurant is incredible. The rooms are huge (~500 sq ft) and the 4 piece marble bathrooms are very nice. 

My wife and I went to the spa and had an excellent experience.  Michelle went above an beyond and is a true hospitality professional.  

",5,2016,09,04
217,Not a 5 star experience.,"I visited Powerscourt hotel for one night with my husband, something I was very much looking forward to. The hotel grounds are beautiful. The hotel main lobby and reception are nicely welcoming. 
We were given our suite immediately, a lovely room, with a large lounge area and double doors that lead into the bedroom. The bathroom is extremely spacious and the walk- in wardrobe is more than generous. This is where my admiration for the hotel ends.
Unfortunately I discovered that our bed was extremely soft and upon further inspection the bases of the bed were actually broken. I called reception who assured me they would get house keeping to look into it. We went for a stroll to allow them the freedom to do this. When we returned to the room 45 minutes later nothing had been seen to, once again I spoke with reception and they assured me housekeeping would fix the problem. I was a bit put out as we were unable to relax in our room and when I mentioned this I was told in a somewhat unpleasant manner that we were not being 'kicked out of our room'. 
I have to say at this juncture that the hotel was remiss in making this problem go away. It proclaims to be a 5 star hotel. Something as simple as moving our room to one with a bed we could actually sleep in or perhaps offering us a refreshment in the bar while they dealt with problem would have solved everything. However this was not done and we were subjected to the whole ordeal which took, in total, two hours to rectify, by which time we had to leave for our dinner reservation. So in fact I could not use the bath or the bed, as we were joined by housekeeping and management traipsing in and out of the room in true Faulty Towers fashion. 
When the Housekeeping manager and the Duty manager visited the room, they would not stop bleating about the Marriot standard of bed being soft and comfortable with feather down toppers, etc. Yet in the same breath saying the beds were eight years old. They did not seem to accept the fact that we were given a suite with a broken bed to begin with. I asked to visit another room to see the standard of bed. It is true, the beds in this hotel are very soft, although not all of them are broken.

The problem was eventually resolved but not without undue irritation to myself and my husband, the paying guests. I was offered a very weak apology as an aside to another lecture about the quality of the beds.
I have forwarded my complaints to the Marriot group as the 'Genuine 5 star resort experience' that they boast for this hotel is certainly not the like any 5 star experience I have had in my life.

On a positive note I would like to mention that the hotel does offer a courtesy car to bring you and collect you from Enniskerry village which is an excellent service. Also the pub in the hotel played wonderful music and is very atmospheric.",2,2016,09,04
217,Top Class,"We attended a wedding at the Powerscourt, stayed for two nights, would have loved to have stayed longer. As I now know what this fabulous hotel is like I will definitely return. Every aspect of the hotel and the very attentive staff was wonderful.",5,2016,09,03
217,Beautiful hotel on a wonderful property,"Stayed here for a single night in late August.  Got a package deal that included dinner and breakfast.  The room was extremely large, nicely appointed, and quiet.  Free wifi and parking.  We had an appetizer & cocktail in the lounge after taking in their gardens (extra fee, but worthwhile), then followed this with dinner in the Sika restaurant.  We found the lounge and restaurant's food and service to be excellent.  The package deal made this a terrific value.  would definitely return.",5,2016,09,03
217,Blissful ,"Visited Powerscourt for our 20th wedding anniversary on the last two fabulous days of the Summer. 

Everything from start to finish was excellent. We got a junior suit which was huge with a fabulous balcony looking out on the front of the hotel so no view of The Sugar Loaf but we got the afternoon sun of which we took full advantage of by sipping champagne in the evening sunshine.

The spa was different than the norm in that the pool was dark with little sparkly lights so it was quite tranquil (except for a a huge amount of kids in it when we had escaped from ours!!). The steam and sauna were lovely except they were outside the pool area so felt there was a bit of walking round in the cold hopping from one area to another.

We ate in the bar the first night which had a great atmosphere and the food was very good.

We ate in the Sika restaurant the second night. The food was excellent and the staff were lovely, especially our waitress from Naples!  

We were sent two Irish Coffees from a relative which was beautifully presented to us with two more small desserts and a little card.

We got to see the Powerscourt Waterfall and the Powerscourt House Gardens which are all so well worth a visit , especially in the fab weather that we got!

The hotel gardens and the view were also stunning.

Overall a lovely stay. The staff were really friendly, warm and extremely efficient without being stuffy.

Will definitely be back for another visit.",4,2016,09,03
217,Romantic Getaway,"Stayed here In August for a romantic getaway as a treat as it is not cheap, but it is well worth it. From check in to check out all staff were lovely and friendly and could not do enough for us, food was lovely especially breakfast and the view from out suite was really breath-taking, all in all a great break away from the kids!!!.  
I would strongly recommended this hotel for a relaxing break.",5,2016,09,01
217,Not 5 star service,"Booked here as a present for my parents wedding anniversary as i live close by so decided to splash out for them and heard so much about the place. On entering the hotel we were greeted by a lovely fella infairness but the reception staff seemed not to have a clue, parents got there room key which was on the 6th floor, for a 5 star hotel you would normally be shown to your room but we were just pointed where to go. Arrived to 2 elavators and went into one that had no 6th floor option and brought us straight down to the bottom floor,went back up to the lobby and finally after a 10 minute  wait a lift arrived which would bring us to the 6th floor. Went into the room which seemed not to have been cleaned,there was a hat on the table and a pair of shoes on the ground which we found strange so we had a good look around the place to find clothes still in the wardrobe,wash bags still in the bathroom and suitcases in a press,thank god there was no1 n d room as they would have got a fair surprise with us walking in. Went down stairs and said it to reception staff which really didn't seem to care and just gave us another room on the 6th floor again. Lifts are a disaster trying to get here. Took an hour after check in to finally get into the room,(really isn't 5 star service) My mother went to book a meal in the restauraunt and she was told that there was no need that you can just walk in as they were guests. Went down for dinner and was told by a lady that it was fully booked to try the mcgills bar where we were told was booked out also even though a couple was going to give us there table as they were finished even then the bar man said we couldn't sit there even after it been offered by a couple sitting there. Went upstairs and said it to a member of staff that we were told we didn't need to book, my parents travelled from west cork with my sister and her 2 year old son which took 5 hours to travel up an hour to get to the room and then told that there was no where to eat? Tank god a member of staff made a table in the bar for us as we were all starved. Nice meal only had a piece of hair in my bowl of soup i got. This weekend was a gift for my parents and was really disapointed with the level of service and standard of the place as its not cheap but decided for a special occasion to splash out.  Defiently wouldn't recommend staying here its not worth it, i'm sure there are more nicer places in the bray area where you will feel welcome,get a great service and value for money.",1,2016,08,31
217,Almost 5 star,"Myself, my husband and two boys went for 3 days to Powerscourt. We had a few teething problems on arrival but once we brought them to the attention of the staff it was all taken care of. Concierge/ manager Robbie went above and beyond to be of assistance and it really made all the difference. Staff are on the whole supberb. Kelly-Ann in the Espa Spa also was especially helpful. Will be back. 

If you are travelling with small children the suite is well worth the extra expense as they have plenty of space if the weather is not what you hoped for.

Sika is excellent. 

The Waterfall is well worth a visit.",4,2016,08,31
217,Fantastic hotel for a country retreat,"I stayed here recently with my family (2 children aged 9 & 5) I am always slightly nervous about bring my children to five star hotels in case they make too much noise or disturb other guests.  There were a number of families staying and the hotel had facilities to entertain them (kids club & outdoor play park).  The rooms were lovely and spacious, very impressive and the staff were pleasant.  The breakfast seemed a little chaotic as they appeared to be under staffed, we requested our tea and toast 3 times, by which stage we had finished our buffet breakfast.  It would not put me off returning, but I would expect better service at a five star hotel",4,2016,08,31
217,Super as always,"Great stay again, we stay three times a year and it's always great. Well maintained and great staff. I recognize the faces all the time and they seem to have low turnover of staff. Everyone is pleasant and the place is pristine. 

I do wish they had a casual dining option other than the pub though. Sika is great but it's too high end for some evenings (mid week it's very dear indeed) and when the lounge is closed, one has no choice apart from going room service. If they fixed this gap, it would be my top hotel in Either Ireland or UK. It's level of maintenance and staff quality at every level is well beyond expectations every time, and it doesn't feel faked. The decor isn't to everyone's taste (not mine either) but it's beautifully done and the bathrooms and Espa toiletries are just wonderful . I could steal one of their baths gladly but it's too big for my home !! Thanks all again for a magical short break. Top tip book queen beds to avoid a 50 euro pull out bed fee if traveling with kids. We got an upgrade to a balcony as there on a quiet mid week -divine !!",4,2016,08,30
217,Lovely hotel,"Myself and my wife stated here overnight for our wedding anniversary and found the hotel to be really nice and were greeted with a ""happy anniversary"" from the receptionist. We went into our room which was nice and luxurious. We went into the lobby bar for a celebratory beverage and found the service to be a little slow and impersonal with very little atmosphere. We went out for a walk around their gardens and a quick game of chess on their giant outdoor board which was good fun. We went for dinner in the hotel restaurant and all I can say is the food was amazing but again the service where good was very impersonal and again it let the side down as it was like service by numbers and no interaction between Manager Staff and customers so it lacked that personal touch as no-one really interacted with us or any other table, both of us being in the service industry just found this to be the only fault with the hotel. Breakfast was a totally different affair the staff were so nice and friendly interacting with the kids beside us and couldn't be more helpful when asking for suggestions of things to do. It was the friendliness of then from the host to the guy who brought us our coffee that made breakfast and it's a shame that this couldn't have been transferred to their evening service. The Spa/Fitness suite was great and the people working there were again friendly and had that personal touch escorting us to the changing rooms and demonstrating how to use the lockers. Yes we will go back and yes we will dine in the restaurant for dinner as the menu and food more than made up for the cold atmosphere.",4,2016,08,30
217,Weekend break with family ,Went for a weekend break with family to the Powerscourt Hotel for our anniversary  first time was absolutely fantastic. Arrived to a lovely double room with a mountain view stunning. Staff were lovely and very helpful. It is a very child friendly hotel as we have a 8 year old and 12 year old very impressed with our accommodation. Lovely pool kids can go into pool from 9-12pm and 3-6pm which is good. Breakfast was super plenty to choose from they also have a pancake maker which is a great hit with the children as they can watch their pancakes being made. The waterfall and gardens is definitely worth going to see amazing small fee to get in but well worth seeing. Will definitely return again. ,5,2016,08,29
217,Very impressive,"We stayed here overnight in one of the suites with mountain view. The hotel was very impressive on arrival & continued to impress throughout the stay. The room was fabulous and the view of the sugarloaf was better than we could have imagined. TV with surround sound in the bathroom was a nice novelty, and the beds were incredibly comfortable (really soft mattresses that you sink into, not what I'm used to but I slept very well) 

We ate lunch (falafel wrap & chicken/brie wrap) in the sugarloaf lounge which was tasty & reasonably priced for the quality of food we received. We were so impressed that we decided to dine in Sika restaurant that evening - we were disappointed to arrive and realise that a set 3 course menu for 69€ was the only option as we hadn't planned on eating such a big meal. We thought we better make the most of our money & take all 3 courses but it really was too much food. For such a large hotel & impressive restaurant I would expect more options, or at least individually priced courses to allow you to pick what you want. Having said that, the food was delicious, the highlight being the fillet of sirloin which we had for main course. We skipped breakfast as we felt it was very expensive at 28€ per person. Instead we had a wonderful breakfast in Avoca cafe at Powerscourt House & Gardens (5mins down the road) at a fraction of the cost! 

The spa was worth the visit, we booked in for a couple of treatments but that came with unlimited access to relaxation room (complete with spectacular view, herbal teas, fruit and snacks) , jacuzzi, steam room etc so you could really make a day of it! 

I look forward to returning here soon, as it really was spectacular but please provide some more options in sika restaurant! 

",5,2016,08,29
217,Amazing .,"Stayed here for one night. The location is wonderful  ...a three minute walk from the famous gardens), Everything about the hotel 
( rooms ,  decor,  service and food ) was fabulous. I would highly recommend it.  
The terrace outside the restaurant is perfect for relaxing  after a delicious breakfast... !!",5,2016,08,28
217,3 night family stY,"Have just returned from a 3 night stay for my husbands 40th birthday! We travelled with our 3 year old and 11mth old baby. I have to say I was concerned this hotel wouldn't be suitable for young children but I couldn't have been more wrong!!! Both our children had an amazing break as did we. Staff couldn't do enough for us, simple things such as placing us close to the breakfast buffet, the man making balloon shapes for the kids at breakfast time,
the space in the hotel that my 3 year old could explore and stretch her legs. Children were well and truly welcome at the hotel! Huge bonus for us! The location is superb and there is so much to do in there surrounding areas! Food in the hotel was superb having had breakfast lunch and dinner at some stage during our stay. Although we did find prices expensive so did eat out in the village.",4,2016,08,28
217,Terrible noises every night,"Every night there was a Karaoke under our window that was a nightmare, we pay a lot of money to get rest at our vecation, but we got white nights !!
This hotel is not worth the price they demand, Not recommended if you come to rest!",1,2016,08,27
217,Great location but not 5 Star,"Powerscourt Hotel is in a great location, rooms are very comfortable, food is okay but compared to other 5 star hotels it's just lacking that personal touch. The staff are polite but something is missing. Have stayed there 3 times now so not a one off event but not again - there are better places to stay in my opinion.It it depends what you want from a hotel - the bling/wow factor or the more subtle low key that you feel from a place. The gardens next door are well worth a visit.",3,2016,08,25
217,Fantastic hotel to just relax,"This was my second time to stay and it was just as good as the first! Ruth at reception was bubbly and not a robot like most receptionists and was a bit of craic and she even upgraded my room to a suite (fantastic room), happy days! Food in the Sika restaurant was A1, staff really friendly and attentive. The swimming pool was a nice spot to go and relax in as well. Overall it is worth every penny to stay here for a nice night away somewhere to just relax and unwind!! 😝👌 ",5,2016,08,24
217,Fab,"No complaints stayed in a jr suite was exceptional.
Pool and amenities are top notch.
A real treat.
Breakfast is very expensive I would suggest skipping breakfast in hotel and walking up to powerscourt house and gardens and have a nice brekkie in there.
Great for a couples night away ",5,2016,08,24
217,Gardens,Very friendly staff from reception to restaurant. Complimentary car and bicycles. Food very good - excellent breakfast. Rooms are to a very high standard. Beautiful large bathrooms with HD TV built into the mirror - sheer luxury. Great location for outdoor man size chess pieces. Irish pub with very nice athmosphere.,4,2016,08,24
217,Overnight stay,"We stayed at this hotel, located in a stunning setting, for one night to celebrate an anniversary.    Adequate and accessible car parking is provided.  Reception was always busy but staff were efficient and helpful.  We had a large corner room which had disabled facilities but no bath. The television in the bathroom was novel and enjoyed.  One minor issue with the room was there was only one bedside light, so that the person on the ' far side ' had difficulty reading in bed.  One more serious issue was the absence of sufficient  electric power points in the room, our room had only one accessible power point, insufficient in this age of technology and gadgets.
  
The highlight of our stay was the evening meal in the Sika Restaurant, which could only be described as outstanding and that relates to both the service and the food.   We also had breakfast in the Sika Restaurant and again service and food were very good.",4,2016,08,23
217,Beautiful location & great hotel!,"Fantastic hotel set in a beautiful location with stunning views. Staff were great from check in to check out. Bedrooms are very spacious - definitely 5 star! We ate in the pub downstairs & had a lovely meal. Breakfast is great with a wide selection of food & staff were very attentive. Plenty to do in the area especially if you have good weather - we walked to the Gardens & drove to the waterfall. These aren't included though so you have to pay to enter each attraction! The Spa & pool area are well kept & lovely to relax in. 
We had a great stay & will definitely return!",5,2016,08,23
217,"Sadly, exremely disappointing.","It really is such a shame that, in an absolutely stunning location, this rather 'grand' hotel seems to be misrepresenting itself. We booked two nights here in order to visit the gardens, walk, revisit old haunts and relax in the hotel we thought we were booking. No such luck - disappointing all round. On arrival we were told, curtly, that our room was not ready. We accepted that politely, since we were a little early. Hours later our room was still not ready and the person designated to update us spoke to us rudely - as though it was our fault that they were not able to deliver our room at the time they advertised. It seems there had been a wedding the day before and guests had simply not checked out! We gave up and went for a glorious walk - of which there are many available, and when, finally, taken to our room it was rather disappointing - narrow windows  looking out on a simply lovely view - why? The suite itself was perfectly adequate, good bathroom, seating area and comfortable bed - but nothing special. The 'fine dinning' is anything but - over fussy service, a disappointing menu and the food itself is most definitely not what is suggested.......our queries were expertly fenced but had no real substance and did not answer our questions. We gave up. We ate in the bar the following evening and the standard there is much better - good bar food. The surrounding countryside is absolutely beautiful but as a base Powerscourt does not deliver what it promises and is disappointing as we feel that had we known we would have booked somewhere else. If excuses need to be made the least it could be politely done, and not via a housekeeper who is clearly fed up and not willing to disguise the fact. We generally found that too many 'excuses' and explanations were offered with no real substance. The hotel seems to cater for weddings, outside bookings and large gatherings rather than the independent traveller and guest. We will definitely return to the area - it is gorgeous - but sadly not to this hotel. One final note - something that really alarmed us and we feel should be brought to management's attention - whilst enduring the very long wait for our room we asked for access to our suitcases so that we could change into walking shoes and were shown into the luggage holding room. Nothing wrong with that except that we were then left alone! Fortunately we pose no threat to anyone, but were surprised, and indeed alarmed, that no one remained with us.",2,2016,08,23
217,Luxurious accommodations Beautiful views,"Lovely and memorable 3 days-  we had an elegant comfortable suite overlooking stunning mountain views. The suite included a full kitchen with built-in espresso machine, extra half bath,  3 TVs, and a spacious private patio. The food was fabulous.  Hotel service was outstanding.  

Challenging mountain golf  course in immaculate condition.  Mountain panorama completed an unforgettable afternoon. 
The Powerscourt Gardens are simply extraordinary and not to be missed. 

One of the best resorts that we have been to!  ",5,2016,08,23
217,Spa Day,"The Spa treatment was excellent, with the exception of the changing area and pool. The changing area was full of screaming kids! we did not use the pool as it was also full of screaming kids. I mentioned this to the staff and was told the hotel is a family hotel. When I go for a spa day, its supposed to be a day of relaxation. I would suggest a separate changing area for day visitors to the spa and don't even show us the pool if its full of children.",5,2016,08,23
217,Treat Yourself - You're Worth It!,"The Powerscourt is a truly wonderful hotel.  The location is approximately 30 minutes south of central Dublin.  The M50 can be congested if you are travelling from the north/airport so you might want to factor that into your travel plans.  The hotel is fairly easy to find, just outside Enniskerry, and is in a beautiful setting below the Wicklow mountains.  The hotel itself is a very grand building with plenty of kerb appeal, and ample free parking.  On arrival staff are welcoming, helpful, friendly and not at all snooty (which can be a problem in some 5 star establishments).  Public areas are immaculate, and traditionally styled - dark woods, ornate soft furnishings, sumptuous carpets.  Even if that isn't normally to your taste you'll have to admit its very well done here.  Bedrooms are huge, beds big and comfy, lots of storage, lots of high tech gadgets.  Bathrooms very spacious and luxurious with Espa toiletries.  I had noted from previous reviews frustration at lack of makeup mirror - but it is there!!  Its inside the mirrored cupboard above/to the side of the wash hand basin.  There are cupboards on either side - one has the hairdryer, the other has the magnifying angled mirror.  Bedrooms also very quiet - no breakout noise from adjacent rooms, or external traffic, just peace and quiet (that was room 227 - maybe they are all that quiet but I can certainly recommend this one if noise is an issue for you).  The Spa area on basement level seems to be an oasis of calm.  The swimming pool, whilst it is 20 metres, has obviously been designed with relaxing in mind rather than serious swimming (its all mood lighting and crystals) but there's nothing to stop you!  The gym is very well equipped, and certainly wasn't busy when I used it.  The hotel's main restaurant Sika is also used as the breakfast room.  It is very tastefully decorated and looks out on a spectacular view.  We chose to dine in Magills, the bar.  It does very nice pub grub (large portions - share a starter), and has live music late on at the weekend.  One exceptional piece of customer service that I observed - a couple came into the bar asking for menus and after buying drinks it was obvious they couldn't find a table (the bar was very busy).  The barman approached them and suggested he check if the restaurant had any open tables and if so they'd be welcome to order from the bar menu and eat in the restaurant.  He disappeared for a few minutes and on return escorted the couple out (presumably to the restaurant) with smiles all round.  I thought that was great, and not something you'd see everywhere.  Breakfast was excellent, the room was very busy but staff appeared unflustered, service was good, and food was hot and plentiful.  At checkout we were offered umbrellas to use as we mentioned we were going to visit the Powercourt Estate Gardens.  We didn't use them, but again excellent customer service - they had no need to offer, we were checking out after all!  The Powerscourt is now my treat hotel of choice, and I will definitely return, hopefully many times!  I just need to save those pennies.",5,2016,08,22
217,When Fiona met Sally,"International Travellers Pay Attention!  This hotel is set in one of the finest, most beautiful and mystical places in Ireland, so unless the weather is being very Irish you should get out and about if you are staying here.  However the hotel itself is also a wonderful place to burrow in with a good book. So, the good points: staff at reception when I arrived were not Irish however they gave a very Irish welcome; it was an excellent starting off point. I found them to be helpful, informative reassuring and..ahem.. accommodating!  I had asked for a room with a nice view and was assigned to a lovely room on the ""Sally Gap"" floor.  The room was spotless, comfortable and with a stunning view.  I took the lift down to the pool:  reminds me a bit of the Marker Hotel (also 5*).  The pool was dark with incidental (Swarovski) lighting and very calming; big enough to do a few laps but more encouraging of floating and drifting....sigh!  A good experience indeed and the jacuzzi too was exceptional.  Some not so good points: There's no socket close to the bed for charging your phone (I like mine close to me), but that's such a little thing.  I did chafe a little at not having a suitable mirror anywhere in the bedroom or bathroom to apply makeup, insert contact lenses, or for my husband to shave by (not really a little thing then).  Breakfast was a confusing affair.  You could order a hot breakfast or help yourself to a ""warm"" breakfast, lukewarm that is.  I ordered toast and although I eat slowly I was fully finished breakfast when the toast arrived (I ordered it three different times).  Waiting staff were unfocused and cavalier, an air of the ""student-about-to-leave-summer-job"" about them, and quite a different to the service provided by the restaurant staff the evening before.  I found my coffee to be bitter so asked if I could have mint tea instead.  There was an audible sigh from the waiting person before she said ""of course.""  I'll stay again...but in future I will breakfast at the adjacent Avoca in Kilmacanogue.",4,2016,08,21
217,Stunning location,"The location itself is worth it!  The beautiful countryside of County Wicklow is the perfect setting for this grand hotel.  We stayed 2 nights (using Marriott rewards for one of them).  Room was large enough for our family of 4, especially considering the closet itself could have been its own room!  Buffet breakfast was included for us (Platinum members) but not sure if it is part of the normal nightly rate.  Nonetheless, it was extensive and there were a variety of options on the buffet.  Spa/pool/gym were all amazing and never seemed crowded over the weekend.  All staff were so friendly and accommodating.  Because we had a rental car, we didn't have meals other than breakfast at the hotel so I can't comment on restaurants at the Powerscourt.  Prior to arrival, I was concerned about the distance from the hotel to Dublin.  But, we easily drove into Dublin in the afternoon (Sunday) & parked 1 block off St. Stephens Green.  It only took us 35 minutes door to door so don't be afraid to use the Powerscourt as a base.  We most loved being in the midst of such beauty and taking advantage of the natural surroundings of the hotel.  I would highly recommend a stay at the Powerscourt and would happily return should I be lucky enough to visit Ireland again.",5,2016,08,19
217,Stunning!,"We stayed here due to the location of the powerscourt gardens we wanted to visit. You can walk to it from the hotel. This hotel was the fanciest place we have ever stayed at. We used our Marriott points to stay here & we were blown away as we entered the lobby, hallways had chandlers & the standard king room was like an apartment.  Love the TV in the bathroom mirror!  If you want to eat a formal dinner, book reservations before you arrive. They book up fast. The pub has great food. We had the chili & the bangers and mash. The only thing it was missing was traditional Irish music. We would highly recommend this hotel. ",5,2016,08,19
217,Family break,Stayed for just one night. Beautiful opulent hotel. Bedrooms enormous with beautiful decor and very comfortable beds.Spa facilities and pool lovely . Lovely breakfast. Only disappointment was evening meal we took in the pub restaurant which was nice but overpriced and quite small and crowded. A nice extra was the use of free bicycles which the hotel had for their guests use. Would definitely recommend this hotel.,5,2016,08,19
217,A real treat!,Just back from an overnight stay at Powerscourt. We had a suite (247). It was absolutely beautiful but if going again I would ask for a room on a higher floor and overlooking the mountains. Everything was spick and span. Bed one that you sink into.  Breakfast lovely. It is expensive - but you get what you pay for!,5,2016,08,19
217,Exceptional staff,Best hotel i have ever stayed in exceptional staff. Only down fall is the bar very dated and no atmosphere in need of a live music. The restaurant is amazing best food I have ever tasted. Breakfast also great brilliant variety and choice,5,2016,08,18
217,Excellent!,"Stayed at Powerscourt Hotel at the end of a two week driving tour of Ireland.  Perfect.  Beds super comfortable, great service, lounge made a fantastic gin and tonic.  The spa/pool area was amazing.  Just what we needed after a fantastic but very busy driving tour of Ireland.  Would love to go back!",5,2016,08,17
217,"Posh, attentive and lovely surroubdings",This hotel (part of the Marriott chain for Rewards Members) was grand. We were upgraded (as Marriott Rewards members) and they have free bike rentals. Beware riding down to the River Walk as it's quite steep coming back up and the bikes are town cruisers - not mountain bikes! Spa inside hotel (included for guests) is a wonderful amenity and the pub and restaurant are quite good. ,5,2016,08,17
217,All round brilliant,"Comfortable bed in a great room, beautiful surroundings, food was brilliant and so where the staff. Located in a beautiful area with stunning views of the sugar loaf mountain. It was perfect for a weekend getaway",5,2016,08,14
217,Wedding Anniversary ,"Booked a 2 night stay in a suite for our wedding anniversary. We arrived early... around 12.30pm and went for lunch at the Sugar Loaf Lounge to wait. We were lucky that around 1.15pm that we got a call to say our room was ready. We very much enjoyed our lunch... the club sandwich was exceptional. All our servers were super and we got a fab table by the window. 

Our room was huge with a super comfy bed. We did have a few niggles though.... 
The wardrobes on the left were sticking and looked to be falling apart (room 439)
There was no ipod docking station
The touch controls were niggly to work
We got no turndown service (not great for a 5 star hotel)
We returned from the Spa after 2pm and our room hadn't been cleaned. We even put on the light for housekeeping whenever we vacated the room. Pretty poor service for 5 stars.
Not a great view.
I spent a lot of money in the 2 nights so would prefer these niggles to be brushed up on. 

On the first night we ate in McGills. It was dark but food was very good.... no complaints at all on that regard.

The second night was our Anniversary and we ate in Sika. Our server Daniella was fantastic and very attentive. We thought the food was only OK. i was very much underwhelmed. We did like and appreciate the dessert served to us to Congratulate us but we got no petit fours :-(  There was a large group in the private dining area who when finished and were walking out were very noisy and were congregating near the door. No effort by any of the staff to quieten them down. It was quite disruptive to other diners.

We took a walk around the ground and visited 'the rose garden' where we didnt see any roses??  The grounds at the other side were fabulous though. 

We visited the Spa and both had treatments.... no complaints. My therapist Sinead was so professional. 

I loved the Sugar Loaf but drinks were very expensive.... €15- €21 for a cocktail. The servers were all so friendly, polite and professional. 

A mixed bag for a review to be honest. Would i return ?.... yes i think so. ",4,2016,08,13
217,Beautiful setting in the Widklow Mountains,"Just an hour outside of Dublin, this resort is set on a beautiful property.  Food options on the property are varied.  Their signature restaurant is an outstanding dinner option.  Rooms are comfortable and have large bathroom.  Staff is extremely helpful. Would return again.m ",5,2016,08,12
217,Excellent hotel,"My wife and I stayed here last Saturday night. We thought it was an excellent hotel in a stunning location. The staff were friendly and polite and the breakfast was amazing. We had a room which was a mini suite effectively with 3 TVs including one integrated into the mirror in the bathroom! I've never seen this before!! The only complaint I had was there was a noisy fan in the bathroom which did not turn off when the lights went out as usually happens in hotels. I brought this to the attention of the staff who assured me it would turn off automatically at 10pm. Unfortunately this did not happen and it kept going all night which did keep me awake a bit! I reminded staff of the issue when I checked out. 

I don't want to sound at all negative though about what is an excellent hotel by international standards and surely one of the very best in Ireland. We thoroughly enjoyed our stay and hope to go back some day!",4,2016,08,11
217,Luxury and surprises around every corner,"The hotel was reserved for us as part of a work event, and OH what a great venue! Our room was a suite with a ""closet"" as big as a bedroom. It made me never want to leave, but there was so much to see, I had to drag myself away. I loved the bottles of water next to our bed each night after the turn-down service. The doorbell to our room was a fun touch too! Very clean and amenities were great. My only issue was that I couldn't do my hair in the bathroom because there was only a shaver outlet. I had to do my hair in the hallway, using the wet bar as my plug-in. And our room was a little warmer than I would have liked, but we couldn't cool it down. That said, we were there during a record heat wave and I'm not sure ANY establishment was prepared for the high heat. Another thing I would have loved -- a gift shop. Wonderful place to stay -- and people watch if you want to catch a celeb hanging out, like we did.",5,2016,08,11
217,Fantastic,"A wonderful 2 night stay, the spar/swimming pool is amazing the rooms are really big with lovely comfy beds and good linen the bathrooms are luxury with nice big white fluffy towels and they was a TV in the bathroom mirror, the breakfast was really nice with every thing you could think of and so tasty a really fantastic stay.",5,2016,08,09
217,Highly Recommend ,"My wife and I rarely travel in luxury, but a friend hooked us up with a room at Powerscourt, and it was easily one of the nicest hotel experiences we've ever had. The hotel design is stunning and authentic. The bed comfortable; room spacious; bathroom remodeled; service excellent; food delicious. When bundled together with the breathtaking views from our balcony, this is an experience we'll never forget!",5,2016,08,08
217,Great Vacation Base for A Family of Four,"Our family of four (including son 13 and daughter 10) have now stayed at the Powerscourt Hotel twice, once in Oct 2014 and again in July 2016.  We enjoyed our 1st stay so much that upon our return to Ireland this summer we went out of our way to stay there again. 

Each time we have had two rooms, one mountain view suite and a connecting room with 2 doubles.  The combined floor space of the two rooms is immense.  It's like renting a very nice apartment.   Very easy living for a family of four.  Everything from the marble bathrooms to the thick soundproof walls and soft linens exudes quality and class. 

The kids loved the breakfast buffet each morning (especially the automatic pancake maker) and enjoyed exploring and playing on the hotel grounds.  The reviews don't lie, Powerscourt is a great hotel.

It is also a great base for exploring the surrounding countryside.  Plenty of hikes are nearby as well as easy excursions to the seaside towns (we particularly liked Greystones and the cliff walk between Greystones and Bray).  Don't miss the all you can eat bread at the Firehouse Bakery in Delgany and follow those ""Fresh Raspberries"" signs if you want to get a big basket of farm fresh raspberries for just 4 euros.  Then take the whole gang to Platform Pizza in Bray at the end the day for child friendly, but tasty meal.

If you are coming with your family to Dublin and enjoy a ""modern country manor"" feel give yourself a treat and stay here, you won't regret it.",5,2016,08,08
217,"Powerscourt Hotel, Autograph Collection, Enniskerry, Ireland","Wonderful week long stay at the Powerscourt Hotel in Enniskerry, Irealnd. The hotel,
grounds, rooms and restaurants were superb. The hotel staff went out of their way
to make our first time visit to Ireland a memorable one. Special thanks to Brian-Concierge and Robbie. Their guidance and patience with all our questions was greatly appreciated.
Everything at Powerscourt is exceptional.It is only about 30-35 minutes away by train
(from Bray) to Dublin which we preferred rather than driving into city. The countryside surrounding Enniskerry is breathtaking.  There are so many small towns to explore and
so much to take in on your way to the bigger cities like Killkenny, which was about 1 hour away. Most notable are the people of Ireland. They are by far the happiest, sincere,
most helpful people we have ever met. Ireland is definitely on our list of places we would like to visit again.",5,2016,08,08
217,Babymoon,"We booked a one bedroom suite for one night as part of our ""babymoon"". It was fabulous from the minute we checked in. Beautiful hotel and property. Staff are very friendly. The swimming pool is fab. We ate in the sugar loaf lounge and our meal was delicious... Pricey but considering our setting the price point was expected. Laura was our server and she was great.  Breakfast was also lovely, great selection and everything was fresh! The gardens are lovely and we had a nice stroll after dinner. Our room was fantastic!!! We were so impressed! The one bedroom suite was huge and we throughly enjoyed our stay. There was a T.V in the mirror in the main bathroom which was a great added extra for while I relaxed in the huge tub. Can't wait to go back! ",5,2016,08,08
217,"The Pros Were Great, The Cons Were Terrible","This was a very hard one to rate. All in all not terrible, but it was the worst 5-star I've stayed in. 

Reception wasn't too friendly, but they weren't rude. However, an hour and a half after check-in time our room still wasn't ready. She assured us they were in the last stages of cleaning our room. We waited around for about 30-45 minutes but there was no change. I had to go and say something, as I was 10 minutes away from an online conference call I had, though I'd hoped to be freshened up beforehand. The room was then ready, where I rushed to make the call (I made it, thankfully). 

The One Bedroom Mountain View Suite was SPECTACULAR! Far bigger than we imagined, really clean, beautifully furnished. Two bathrooms, a living/dining area, walk-in closets, kitchen, mirror with TV, state of the art appliances, great view, etc. We had no qualms with how the room was presented. For 465 euro a night, the room was well worth it, we loved it. The only thing I'll say was that the AC didn't seem to work in our bedroom (though worked fine in the other rooms), but that was easily remedied by opening the balcony door. 

The one issue we had with our accommodation was the terrace. It was MUCH larger than we thought (more than your standard balcony). However, not a table, a chair; just bare. We would have liked to have breakfast or coffee to enjoy the great view of Sugar Loaf mountain, but there was nothing. I'd like to have seen some kind of outdoor furnishings. And maybe next time the fountain in the centre of the garden can be turned on for aesthetic purposes.

I took a spa day where I got a salt/oil scrub, Indian head massage, Balinese full-body massage and a luxury pedicure. The staff down there were INCREDIBLY nice. The treatments were wonderful and the facilities were grand. I really enjoyed my spa day and would highly recommend the services. 

The biggest con we had with this place was the food. Even for a 3-star hotel, the food was just terrible, not even close to the 5* standard we were expecting. I was so looking forward to having the kinds of dishes I'd get at the Beverly Hills or The Ritz London, but this was dreadful (see pics). When working (which I was), hubby and I typically order room service. First, I ordered a salmon bagel. They sent a bacon burger instead. The woman who delivered it was very nice and apologetic and took it back to bring up the correct order. Upon the first bite, the bagel was stale and dry and cold in the centre, like it was frozen then thawed. And as soon as I took that first bite, there was a large hair in my food (not mine, I assure you). My husband told the front desk on his way out and they sent another. Once again, gross bagel. I didn't even eat it and just had chips for dinner. My husband's burger was also bland and burnt. A chippers would have been more appetising. 

While I love fancy food, I couldn't get my husband to Sika, where their menu has ox tongue and such, so I can't say anything about Sika, since we didn't eat there. But the menu seemed more suited for gourmet dining. So instead, we went to McGills pub the next night for dinner. The food at McGills was bar food, but even for bar food, it was meh. 
That evening, hungry from picking at our food, we ordered a pizza from the room service menu. At 5* prices, I was appalled at the burnt, frozen pizza I got and the microwaved dessert. It was inedible. You could see from under the pizza that it was frozen. I was expecting freshness and care put into their food, but the food there was just appalling, all across the board. Breakfast was also OK, nothing terrible. But again, not 5* quality and nothing blew our minds. 
The caramel popcorn snack was good, but I'd asked if it was homemade on the phone and the man said it was. I'd just returned home from Pennsylvania where the streets smelled of fresh kettle corn and caramel corn, it's my favourite snack. This however was just microwaved popcorn covered in caramel. It wasn't bad tasting, but I didn't like being told it was homemade when it clearly wasn't. 
You can only say so many things about the food without anything being done before you just give up.

I would come back, if only for the spectacular room and the great pool and spa. It was a nice weekend away. However, I'll be bringing my own food to prepare in the suite's kitchen next time!",3,2016,08,07
217,"5 star hotel, 1 star baby cot beds.","We stayed here for 3 days with our twin 8 month old girls. I paid €765 for the privilege so I expected & received 5 star accommodatio & facilities. Unfortunately my children did not. Two weeks before our arrival my wife contacted the hotel & requested 2 cot beds. At check in we were told they were in our room. On arrival to our room we found that the cot beds were not delivered. I returned to reception & enquired about the beds, housekeeping were called & I was assured they were on the way. An hour later & still no sign of the beds. Another trip to reception & another reassurance. No big deal we thought as we were going for a stroll. On our return 2 cot beds were indeed in the room. Both beds were a disgrace for a hotel of this calibre. Chipped plastic edge's, dirty material & large holes in the netting was not what we were expecting. The holes in the netting would also pose a serious health risk to an older child. I also had great difficulty trying to access the hotel's (beautiful) gardens because of the number of steps involved. Eventually made it by following a member of staff advice & used a fire exit. Based on my experience I cannot recommend the hotel to people with young children or for that matter people with a physical disability who wish to visit the gardens, spa (more steps) or in fact enter\exit the hotel as it's not wheelchair (or pram) friendly.",4,2016,08,05
217,A surprise treat for me.,"A surprise treat for me. Our suite was like an apartment, so bright, airy and spacious, bed huge and soo comfy. Absolutely loved it. The downstairs bar was a bit dark for us but the food was very good. We didn't do the fine dining experience due to time constraints but would return to do so.",5,2016,08,05
217,Carlsberg probably does this hotel,"From start to finish I really can't fault the place at all, it's a must. So luxurious but not pompous, I live in Dubai and this hotel would be hard beaten in terms of other competitors in Ireland and around the world, the setting, the amenities available, the rooms and the service were all above and beyond the rest. The food was excellent, will definitely return to this hotel. Well done to all the staff, they are what make the hotel so great. ",5,2016,08,04
217,Amazing,"Stayed here with my family. Beautiful suite, great staff, couldn't do enough for us. Thanks to Brian, who went above and beyond to make our holiday amazing. Children were warmly welcomed and had an amazing time.",5,2016,08,04
217,All the pomp without the substance,"Stayed here for one night on the 1st of August as a treat for my partner's 30th birthday. Paid €382 for one night B&B, dinner in the Sika restaurant and tickets to Powerscourt gardens. Driving up to Powerscourt... The scenery is stunning, the hotel rises from the trees as an impressive ivory block of a building and the reception oozes luxury. Had to wait until 4.30 to get the room, but when we arrived it was a beautiful suite, spotless and felt like a real treat. 

My partner is a fussy eater and we checked the menu of Sika restaurant, nothing was really suitable... And at €69 a head, it seemed pointless to be going there. I went to reception and asked could we possibly cancel the dinner and dine in one of the other restaurants. The man at reception said that we could indeed do that and that we would sort out the bill at check out, the combined price of the meal being €138, as the gentleman said. I took this as we would be reimbursed the €138 and that we would pay for our food in the other restaurant. 

We ate in McGills... Simple bar food, nothing spectacular... The price amounting to around €100 with drinks, which we added to the room. The next day at check out, I was handed a bill for extra items, including drinks and a movie we had ordered to the room ... Plus the €382. The same man was at the reception as the night before and I promptly said... Are we not getting reimbursed the price of the meal as discussed yesterday? I was told that I had been mistaken and that we could dine in any of the restaurants to the value of €138 and that he had made that clear the night before. I exclaimed that we would need to be eating a lot of food in the other cheaper establishments to amount to €138 and I was told that that was ""my loss"", because I had chosen to not eat in the Sika restaurant. At this point I felt ""tricked"" and told the gentleman so... After multiple calm repeats of such statement, the receptionist said he would not charge for the drinks because of the confusion... Fine, thank you, but I was still not impressed, particularly because I felt tricked. I agreed to the deal reluctantly and then asked for the garden tickets, to which I was told that there were no garden tickets on my deal... At that stage I was seeing red and had to whip out my phone and the confirmatory email and show it to the receptionist to prove that the garden tickets were included in the deal... So he knew exactly what meal was included in my ""deal"" that I had to pay for but was denying the tickets... I had to defend myself with the confirmatory email. I was not impressed to say the least. 

Beautiful hotel, but need to work on how to accommodate your guests that are paying over the top money for staying at the hotel. ",3,2016,08,04
217,Lovely,"Spent our first night in Ireland in this beautiful place. We had toured Dublin after arriving from the USA and it was such a welcome retreat. Lovely grounds, beautiful gardens and welcoming check-in. Our room was perfect for planning our day, resting peacefully and the breakfast was divine! Thank you for a lovely stay!",5,2016,08,04
217,Fabulous stay with friends in amazing surroundings,"I recently visited here and stayed with a group of friends.  Grounds were amazing.  We had some spa treatments and we were all delighted with our treatments.  Our rooms were spacious and beautifully decorated.  All staff were helpful and friendly.  Very enjoyable, we are planning a return visit!",5,2016,08,03
217,Wonderful hotel,"We stayed at the Powerscourt Hotel in May of this year and we're very happy with our choice. The hotel itself was beautiful, our room was very large, well appointed and with a nice mountain view. We wish we would have spent more time here instead of transferring to a hotel in the center if Dublin after just two nights. The afternoon tea was pretty pricey so we skipped that but the hotel pub had great food and was reasonably priced. We did not have breakfast at the hotel, instead we opted to drive to Poppies in nearby Enniskerry (more reasonably priced). The hotel has a complimentary limo (BMW sedan) which we used to take us into Enniskerry and pick us up for dinner one night.

The gardens are not to be missed! In 2014 National Geographic rated it number 3 out if 10 of the most beautiful gardens in the world.

Overall, an excellent stay!",5,2016,08,03
217,Has the potential to be great...,"Myself and my husband stayed here for 3 nights. 
Check in was fine. Our room was a mountain view suite, it was a nice size and well laid out. However, the room was let down with numerous small details that didn't seem to be 5*; such as the tea/coffee making facilities being a kettle and some sachets of instant coffee. The hairdryer was not great quality and was not very powerful. The sinks took a long time to drain and there was hair (from previous guests) in the shower area. 
Our call to reception at one point just rang out again and again. All small details, but they are noticed when paying premium prices in what claims to be a luxury hotel.

This was a busy bank holiday, but in general the service was poor. In particular, breakfast was disappointing. It was quite noisy, with lots of stacking of cups, cleaning of cutlery and loud conversation coming from the kitchen. People were also kept waiting for a long time to be seated, as the person in charge simple disappeared for extended periods of time. 

We didn't eat in the Sika restaurant, but the pub and Sugar Loaf restaurants weren't great. Nothing was written down, so inevitably there were issues with our orders. The food also just seemed to be lacking that final professional touch. It was also pretty chaotic at times, with lots of loud children making it really difficult to relax.

Overall, there is a lot of improvement needed here and I would seriously reconsider paying this kind of money here again. It has the potential to be a five star and the location is amazing, but currently operates at the level of a four star at best.",2,2016,08,02
217,"Amazing, with tiny changes.","We have stayed for one night in a Deluxe room, upon arrival the receptionist(s) were very kind and have given all the essential information we have asked for . The room was clean however the bed was very poorly made. The pillows looked like someone has just threw them there like ""here you go""... The bathroom receives a 5* , excellent standard there. 
We enjoyed the espa areas, very clean and tidy. 
Sadly , for dinner we had to go to Enniskerry (Emilia's) as the menu was very limited in both restaurants and bar. BUT! The breakfast was brilliant, huge choices and the pancake machine was something I found for the first time in any hotel we've stayed in . The waiter asked us if we would like toast , we said yes .. However he hasnt brought any to our table , even though we asked him twice (this was very dissapointing) 
The housekeeping staff didnt bother to say hello when we walked down the corridor , but when we departed only one girl (short,young, black hair cleaning the 3rd floor) was bothered enough to ask how our stay was and said goodbye. 
Everything else was great and I would recommend this hotel to other people, just with tiny changes .",4,2016,08,02
217,Amazing hotel,"Stayed in lots of great hotels in Ireland, but think this is one of the best.  
Amazing hotel in an amazing setting. 
You are going to pay for the pleasure, but I wasn't disappointed. Money well spent. 
The spa and swimming pool are worth a visit, small little pub does good food and Guinness. 
",5,2016,08,01
217,Better than Excellent,"Visited here for overnight and also on a separate occasion for lunch. Both times service was impeccable. Grounds and hotel are both magnificent. On overnight ate dinner in McGills bar downstairs which was lovely. Breakfast following morning, huge amount of choice. Well impressed with gluten free options for all dining. Great staff, helpful and accommodating, certainly understand customer service.",5,2016,08,01
217,Grown-up getaway break,"My Husband I stayed in this beautiful hotel recently for one night dinner, bed and breakfast break. Our deluxe room was wonderful. Very tastefully decorated. Bar and restaurant staff were excellent. Dinner in the Sika restaurant that night was delicious although we felt the desserts could have been better. Decor throughout the entire hotel was beautiful and tbe gardens were really nice. Breakfast the next morning was very very good. Lots of choice. One thing that put a SLIGHT dampner on our stay was that our room wasn't ready when we arrived at 4pm and we had to wait until 5.30pm before anybody came to us with our key cards. During this time we had a few drinks in the bar which was lovely, but I can't help think, was this the hotels way of getting us to spend more money while we waited for the room to be 'ready'?  Saying that, I will definitely return to this beautiful hotel again and hopefully have more time to experience the pool and spa. ",5,2016,08,01
217,Very mixed. This is not a five star hotel.,"Lovely location with great views from the back. The room (a superior) was clean and nicely furnished. The outlook was a wall. I found the touchpad that operates the lighting and air con hard to operate and fairly unresponsive. The air con did not do a whole lot in fact. One of the control panels was loose on the wall which should have been fixed prior to arrival (don’t they check rooms?) Coffee in the room was instant and the milk in sachets. For 265 euros a night I expect more than this. The restaurant choice was not great with a limited menu in the pub (13 euros for a glass of prosecco in a themed irish pub!) Breakfast was good other than the excessive noise from the Americans at the next table. This is certainly not an exclusive hotel. The queue to check out was nothing that I had ever seen before and was almost extending outside the hotel. I didn't wait. An express checkout was not evident. The day after leaving, they tried to charge me for what seemed like most of the content of the mini bar! Although the hotel charges 5* prices, the level of service is way off.",2,2016,07,30
217,What more could you want?,"It has everything a traveller could want. Three  days of adventure were had at this magnificent hotel.. We are two golfers and we were able to play the East and West courses on consecutive days.  The third day was spent bike riding and exploring the beautiful Powescourt house and gardens.  Down the road at Enniskerry a large variety of pubs and most importantly for travellers a reasonably priced laundry service. 
A delightful interlude",5,2016,07,28
217,"Fabulous hotel, will definitely be returning","We are fortunate enough to have stayed in many of Marriott's higher end properties around the world and this one is right up there with some of he best.  Rooms are excellent. Beautiful surroundings.  Small issue at check in dealt with calmly and efficiently by front desk supervisor. Otherwise pretty much a faultless stay with extremely friendly service from everyone from housekeeping, bar/restaurant staff, concierge etc.  Will definitely be coming back here for some more relaxation.",5,2016,07,28
217,Magnificent & Luxurious Hotel in a beautiful location,"Powerscourt hotel is one of the most luxurious hotels in Ireland, surrounded by the beautiful hills of Wicklow.  We had a magnificent suite, which consists of a huge bedroom and another huge adjoining room, with a nice desk, and seating area.  The suite had a balcony, with glorious views overlooking Sugar Loaf Mountain.  The bed was huge, and really comfortable.  The suite is a magnificent place to have a few glasses of wine before dinner; though mini bar prices are a bit steep, and the local village wine shop “The Parting Glass”, has a great selection.  

The gardens are a nice place to go for a stroll, and there’s even a giant chess board. The pool is lovely for a swim and then quiet relaxation - overall I would have to say the amenities are excellent. 

We were recommended by friends to try out the bar food, though the place was packed, with no tables available.  I wasn’t very impressed by the bar, and was actually glad it was full, because we then went to the “Sugar Loaf” restaurant, which was really lovely, with a nice romantic ambiance, and the food was delicious.  As the name suggests, it has a spectacular view out across Sugar Loaf mountain.  We also had breakfast in the same place the next morning – the food selection was very impressive.

The following day we went for a drive around the local area – it’s been years since I’ve been in this part of Wicklow.  It’s a lovely place to drive, and if I'd had a bit more time, I would have gone on the trek up Sugar Loaf.   We’ll definitely be back again in the future.",5,2016,07,25
217,"Beautful property, stunning surroundings","We arrived early and received an upgraded room which was really a small suite. The room itself was so beautiful it was tempting to never leave...except that the surrounding area of Wicklow was spectacular for hiking and beautiful scenery.  Don't miss the Powerscourt Gardens, rated #3 by National Geographic for botanic gardens.",5,2016,07,25
217,Exceptional ,"We thoroughly enjoyed our 2 nights at Powerscourt and wished it was longer. Service is truly superb and rooms wonderful. The property is amazing!  As a Marriott Platinum Premier member, I received a large room upgrade. There was no view per se, but that was OK.  

Breakfast is substantial and high quality. The spa is very nice and fitness facility is first rate. I only wish that we could have stayed longer. ",5,2016,07,25
217,Quietness and luxury in the details,"Quiet place - almost no urban noise. There are many new tech and luxury things in the details - we had three touch screen control panels for air conditioning,  lighting and some other hotel services. The TV into the mirror of the bathroom was more useful, than I thought before. The terrace of the one bedroom suite is pretty large, but without chairs - usually the weather is not good to spend time seating outside, so we didn't ask for such a furniture.
The staff is very helpful and friendly - do not hesitate to ask a question or for help. 
The mini centrifuge dryer for swim suit in the changing rooms is a new device.",5,2016,07,25
217,Glorious spot in Ireland ,"I was lucky enough to be part of a group of over 200 that stayed for 5 nights in this fine place! The gardens are absolutely stunning and this is a truly ideal place to have some sort of magical event. The hotel is newish and well appointed with spa, gym, pool, bars, restaurant and a friendly and helpful staff. The magic of the place are the old buildings, gardens and walking trails. Sculptures surprise at every turn. The views are glorious and there is also a very nice golf course on premise. ",5,2016,07,24
217,Beautiful hotel but....,"We decided to stay at Powerscourt hotel on July 23rd for a romantic night away. Our first impression of the outside and the inside of the hotel was wow... The staff too made a great impression on us they were all very helpful and attentive . Our room was perfect so was the view of the resort from our balcony . The hotel is beautifully decorated but a couple of things myself and my husband weren't too keen on. One was the fact you have to walk through the restaurant to get to the terrace ... Very odd as you feel your disturbing guests dining in the restaurant by walking in and out . The other area we didn't like was McGill's bar ... Doesn't look at like an Irish bar only for the usual hurling stick on the wall plus the seats in it are hard and uncomfortable and the bar certainly doesn't match a five star hotel . The staff are great and i have to give a special mention to Ian who was very friendly and was on the bar floor ensuring everyone was well looked after.. Now i come to the breakfast which was served  in the Sugar loaf lounge as hotel was busy . I would give one star for the food as it didn't taste great at all , wasn't presented well , no eggs except scrambled , very little sliced bread on display plus i don't expect to wait five minutes or more to toast my bread in a toaster that you would find in any household kitchen... Five star hotels should bring toast to your table and not expect guests to huddle around a four slice toaster .. Its a pity that the below average breakfast has let this beautiful hotel down for us but these things can be improved on very easily. ",4,2016,07,24
217,"Price 5 star, but quality below ","We came there just for 1 nights, paid 340 euro for a room, we expected amazing treatment...5 star treatment. After arriving to hotel none offered drink to us, was quite warm. After checking in we went to the room. Room was quite dark but ok, i was expected jacuzzi in the room, unfortunately it wasn't. Even there wasn't tooth brush or tooth paste.....We found mould in shower room and door full of limescale. After 11 pm is no chance to order pizza , kitchen serving very few dishes... Finally i had to order pizza from Apache pizza in Bray and pay for delivery . I was waiting for breakfast, have to admit was ok but no 5 star, lack of salmon or and see food dishes, no fat free yougurt, generally you can get such breakfast in any hotel - not even 5 star. Overall hotel is in very nice location and I think you pay for it because spend 340 euro for a night is not worth it.",3,2016,07,24
217,See it to believe it!,"Myself and my partner had the absolute pleasure of staying here last night on a spur of the moment night away sort of thing! 

Right from the  off we were greeted by friendly and very welcoming staff, quick check in at the counter and we were shown to our room by a bellhop named Atilla who gave us some very helpful information about the hotel and even showed us all the bells and whistles in the room - quick bite to eat in the sugarloaf lounge (try the falafel wrap it's delicious!) Before we hit the spa for some pampering!

The package we got in ESPA deserves it's own review as the service was outstanding!! 

The highlight of the night away was dinner in Sika, the ox tongue and smoked eel was delicious and the loin of lamb was fantastic but what really made the evening was the staff who kept our glasses full and assured we had everything we needed, Joel our waiter was an absolute pleasure 

10/10 will definitely be back ",5,2016,07,24
217,Amazing,This was by far the best hotel we stayed in during our trip and we stayed at Ashford Castle and all of the best hotels/Trip Advisor #1s. We were surprised! It was a perfect location for Bray/Wicklow. The rooms were huge and updated. Total luxury. The bath products were all espa and the bathroom was amazing!!! The bed was the most comfortable of our trip and the view amazing. We went to the pub and it had great food and drinks as did the other dining area. ,5,2016,07,23
217,Must stay,"Outstanding hotel, staff so friendly and welcoming. Worth upgrading to a mountain view room.
Rooms very clean and every amenity you could need.
Food in McGills is very good as it is in Sika, again  staff in both could do no more to make your experience perfect.",5,2016,07,23
217,My happy place,"Beautiful place, huge room, perfect bed, walk-in closet, friendly service, good food, awesome spa, the grounds were amazing. 45 minutes to Dublin and 15 minutes from my favorite pub, Johnnie Fox's. Enniskerry is 3 miles away and very quaint, but you need a car. Although it rains a lot in Ireland, this hotel is like a beam of sunshine with a rainbow.",5,2016,07,21
217,The suite is a-mazing!,We stayed in a fabulous suite which was MASSIVE! The quality of accommodation was top notch & luxurious and breakfast was of a high standard.  Staff were professional and helpful. (NB. breakfast is served until 11am during summer months - information in the room stated 10am),5,2016,07,20
217,"Weekend Break, simply amazing","Short and sweet. Absolutely stunning place. Food, staff, accommodation, surroundings. Absolutely faultless. 
We stayed a weekend here and enjoyed every second. The staff are brilliant, professional and courteous. 
The food in Sika restaurant was a real highlight. I look forward to the next time dining there. 
The bar had a great atmosphere for a few evening pints and just to chill out. 
The room we had was a mountain view suite. Fantastic views. Suite was huge and very well presented. Would highly recommend. 
Overall absolutely delighted with our stay in Powerscourt. And look forward to the next one.",5,2016,07,20
217,Marriott's Irish Shame ,"Let's be clear: this is a modern (2007) property in a magnificent setting. Rooms are spacious and complete. 

Also: I am a Gold status Marriott member: this requires 50 nights in Marriott properties. I know Marriott all over the world.

I knew I was in trouble when checking in at 3:30 pm the receptionist said ""the room is not ready."" There was no Gold member welcome. Also, there would be no room upgrade. There was a simple, direct nonverbal: ""sit down, and be quiet.""

The training here is deficient and the staff inadequate. The first morning at breakfast, the entire Restauarant was a disaster. A large group left tables disgusting and they stayed this way for our entire breakfast of 90 minutes. They whined: ""we had a large group!"" I took several pictures over the time of breakfast and reported to the Management. 

So here is the question: if a guest stays over 50+ nights a year, and explains these deficiencies to the Management, would you expect a response?

Also: it's always the small details which make an outstanding property: the three flags which welcome you to the property are torn, frayed, and completely unacceptable for the nation's flag. Please replace them. 

I cannot recommend this property and they service is 3stars or less. 

",3,2016,07,19
217,First Visit,This was our first visit and will not be our last. We were celebrating our wedding anniversary I advised the hotel before we travelled and on a number of occasions it was marked from the moment we checked in to fruit in our room and for our dinner that evening. Staff overall were first class especially in the Spa where both myself and my wife had treatments. Unfortunately our stay was too short but we will be back again.,5,2016,07,19
217,Really disappointing,"My partner and I stayed here for two nights as part of my Birthday celebrations last August and it was disappointing from the start. We booked a 'dine and unwind' package and on arrival at 9:45pm we were told that the kitchens were closing and we could not have starters, despite the fact we had already paid for them. We went for a swim the next day and matters went from bad to worse, the pool was cold and an emergency exit had been left open so the whole pool room was freezing, we decided to go and warm up in the sauna only to find that it along with the steam room were closed for maintenance, as a last resort we headed for the jacuzzi but once there found there was a slight but definite smell of feet. As far as we were concerned the main attractions in this hotel were the food and the spa, it was a shame that we we're let down on both fronts...for this price you can do far better elsewhere",2,2016,07,18
217,Excellent Property!,"This hotel is exceptional. The staff was incredibly friendly, offering us a room upgrade upon arrival to accommodate our request for connecting rooms. The rooms and bathrooms are outstanding. The staff is incredibly friendly at every turn. All meals on site were wonderful - from the pub to the breakfast. In particular, the scones with fresh honey from a honeycomb is something I won't forget. I wish every hotel stay was a wonderful as this. Cheers to the Powerscourt staff. Thank you all!",5,2016,07,18
217,Five star hotel with two star service,"I have wanted to try this hotel for a while now, so I decided to book it for our wedding anniversary!

We got a deal that included spa treatments and dinner! When I called to book our spa treatments the girl suggested that I tell the hotel that it was our wedding anniversary, so I did! I don't know why I bothered!

Upon check in I was told that our room was just a few minutes from being ready, I said that was fine because we were headed to the spa, he said he would have our room keys dropped down as soon as it was ready. It was only twelve and I was aware that check in is not until four, although I did request an early check inn! Nothing was explained to me such as where breakfast would be served or the direction to the spa and so on!

The service at the spa was wonderful, great service with attentive staff. The lunch was lovely and the staff wished us happy anniversary! After lunch I asked if our room key was dropped down as I wanted to pop up before our treatment, it wasn't dropped down yet! After our treatments around four forty five, the room key was still not dropped down so the girl called reception and requested the key, after a while the girl decided to go to reception to get the key herself! (I was on my robe)!

We were really looking forward to dinner in Sika to celebrate our wedding anniversary! There were only two other tables occupied, however it took fifteen minutes for someone to take our drinks order! The menu itself is pretentious without it needing to be! Dessert was disappointing! My husband ordered the almond crumble and the plate came out with cubes of jelly, bits of pavlova, cream and some raspberries with some almond crumbled over the top! What's going on with desserts these days, that it's just the ingredients of the dessert on the plate - stop messing with the desserts and keep it simple and tasty! We don't often eat dessert so it was just so disappointing!

My overall opinion is this;
The hotel itself is beautiful, old worldly and quite magestic! But it appears to me that they have cut back on staff!

It's definitely not five star! The service was poor!
This was a learning experience for me, there's a reason why I prefer smaller boutique hotels! I definitely won't be back!",2,2016,07,18
217,It's just out of these world,"In the Presidential suite. Very nice but they need to update their TVs and maybe have some surround sound in place. 

The manager is very good. Met all our needs and VVIP treatments. Very good bed and of course the views from the room is wow. And the clean and smell free situation of the whole hotel. 

Zero racism here because I'm black. I have to say that ",5,2016,07,17
217,Disappointing....,"Having returned to Powerscourt for a three day stay after a visit in April which was faultless, I have to say my experience was this time was disappointing. The hotel does not have the attention to detail and service level expected from that of a five star venue! 

Upon check-in we ate in the Sugar Loaf lounge on Wednesday afternoon; the menu was very limited and the service was terrible! There seemed to be some animosity among staff and most of the floor staff had the 'I don't want to be here' attitude! Guests were been seated at tables that were not cleared or cleaned and the atmosphere was far from relaxing or enjoyable. It was hard to get the attention of any staff member as none of them appeared to want to make eye contact with any guests. 

We stayed in a garden view suite and the room itself was beautiful and very spacious, however, housekeeping was a let down. Small details like missing glassware, uncleaned glass and a mini bar that required cleaning. We also had to request a breakfast room service order card as housekeeping had not left one in the room; we filled it out and left it on the door for collection as instructed. The following morning breakfast never arrived; we checked the door only to find the card had never been collected. When in-room dining was contacted they said they must of forgot to collect it!

Then on our final night while getting ready in our room before dinner, two guests walked into our room with their luggage!! They had checked in at reception and had been allocated our room! I contacted reception and all I was told was 'sorry'. 

This hotel has the potential to be outstanding. The grounds are beautiful and the setting is spectacular. However, the hotel does lack consistency and personality.",4,2016,07,15
217,Beautiful hotel,"The decorations are lovely and modern but reflecting the Autograph Collection style. 
The rooms are huge and the bathrooms are lovely (tv on the mirror even!) There is a walk in closet which is class. 
The breakfast was really tasty as well and the pool is fab!
Staff were really nice during our stay.
Would definitely recommend",5,2016,07,15
217,Beautiful Hotel!,"This fantastic hotel is about a half hour south of Dublin. Every aspect of it was wonderful.  The staff was helpful and cheerful, the public spaces were very nice, and our mountain view suite was just spectacular!   The 2 bathrooms in our suite were huge and so well appointed. The furnishings were delightful.  I almost didn't want to the leave the room to sightsee! We visited the Powerscourt Garden while here, and also spent several hours walking around Glendalough.
I would love to return some day. ",5,2016,07,14
217,"Attentive staff, luxurious property","You can't beat the convenience of this hotel, with its proximity to Powerscourt Gardens. The staff was incredibly attentive, even boxing up a breakfast and coffee for our crack-of-dawn departure, because the main dining room wasn't open. Staying at the hotel also gives you access to a private Powerscourt river walk adjacent to the gardens, which made for a wonderful afternoon activity. The only thing we found lacking was the outdoor space behind the hotel - it was an ideal location for a restaurant patio or a pool or something, but it was neglected and practically empty. Overall though this place scored high marks from us, we'd stay here again!",5,2016,07,14
217,True grandeur,"A beautiful luxury hotel set amongst rumbling hills and picturesque countryside.  This is the kind of hotel where the staff go out of their way to make you feel at home, and they pre-empt any requests or needs you may have.  Exceptional.",5,2016,07,12
217,"Stunning accommodation, spa","Coming straight to Powerscourt from DUB was such a nice way to begin our vacation. Proximity to many nice day trips and a very comfortable place to return to at the end of the day. Beautiful grounds, pool, and facilities. All of the amenities were of highest quality. Our room was perfectly appointed and very large. I only wish we could have stayed longer. ",5,2016,07,12
217,"Incredible luxurious place, very nice area, well trained staff","Been there on Business trip and there is really nothing to criticize except the fact that the room had no window to open. Since that stay I realize HOW important this is to me. Most of all in Ireland. Actually I am not a friend of ACs.
When I asked to change my room (even if an upgrade would have been necessary: I would have paid all) I was told twice that this is not possible as they could not change any room and most of them wouldn´t have a window to open anyway. Actually I knew that a third of the hotel was booked by my company and that the others arrived later than me, so it made me a bit upset that they didn´t give me another room with a window to open. And even more upset I was when some of the collegaues told me they had windows to open. So THIS is really something to work on. But actually I know (as I once worked in a hotel) that a receptionist always tries first to convince guests that all is fine where they are .... but well this time I was on the other side of the bar. 
So the room was elsewise impressive and you could mention whatever: it was there. I think I counted about 10 mirrors in my room. It was a place one could get lost. Really. The breakfast was really nice too and the Service was just INCREDIBLE well! They were not just friendly they all were superb!
I even did a massage: Well, I could have avoided this as it was rather a sale Event for lotion a.s.o. as the treatment was really far too expensive for what they did. The pool was o.k. with nice light effects but the sauna area was rather poor - the hammam nearly cold. But actually I do not think if Wellness whenever I think of Ireland ;-)
The are was soooo cool and lovely. 
Another thing they should definitely improve: the cocktails in the bar. Better have a Guinness in the pub downstairs instead! Otherwise you might be disappointed ... 
All in all I think a stay in this hotel is a really enjoyable experience and I definitely recommend to go there!!!",4,2016,07,11
217,Fantastic stay,"We spent one night at the hotel as part of our ""minimoon"" get away. We loved every minute of it.
Parking was close to the hotel and there were plenty spaces. 
Checkin & checkout were completed via the app which made it super fast.  Collected our room key at reception and staff were very pleasant. 
The reception was very impressive. The decor was fabulous. 
We booked a suite and it was worth every penny.  Staff arrived with a lovely plate of chocolate treats.  The view from the room was looking out on the garden.  The balcony was huge.  
We ate in Sika and kudos to our Waiter, Dario who was really attentive and worked well even when it got busy.  He went above & beyond with extra touches which really made it even more memorable for us. 
We used the spa facilities in the morning which was really impressive.  I had a massage with Karen. I had asked her for a deep massage and it was just that.  Its rare that I find someone who will apply enough pressure to make you feel the benefit afterwards. I cant recommend her enough.  We also used the relaxation area and pool area afterwards.  If taking a trip to the hotel definitely check them out.",5,2016,07,11
217,Absolutely fabulous!!,"We have been in some lovley hotels but this one certainly stands out from the rest.  This outstanding hotel and spa certainly deserves its 5 stars and more.  The staff are very conscientious and very friendly on all levels.  The rooms are beautiful, comfortable and  tastefully decorated throughout.  Will definitely be visiting again very soon.",5,2016,07,11
217,"""If we could score six stars we would""","We stayed in the Powerscourt suite and this hotel was Absolutely perfect from the room to the reception staff, to the spa facilities to the grounds. 

From the moment we checked in we loved this hotel, the staff were so friendly at check in, our room wasn't quite ready so we had tea and scones in the lounge while we waited and the staff made us feel so welcome,the service was perfect. 

When we got our room we were stunned especially with the views it was perfect with so much space from its beautiful spacious bath in the ensuite to the spacious living area. You could actually stay in bed and have All the controls from lighting to electronic blinds and climate control right beside you in the pull drawer(picture below).  

Then there is the stunning views looking over the sugarloaf mountain and valley. The room service was very nice and very quick, we were told that they were busy and it would take 40 mins but if came in 20.

The indoor pool and jacuzzi are perfect felt so relaxed and then the steam/sauna room and ice cold water bucket really refreshed us. 

The breakfast was beautiful the next day and the food so fresh and the most pleasing thing about breakfast was there is something for everyone.

So if your after a luxury stay and yet want to still feel welcome and relaxed,this is the place to be.it's hard to believe the grounds/hotel is so exclusive and in such a stunning landscape but yet only 30mins from Dublin city centre, if we could give 6 stars we would so thank you Powerscourt and staff, we will be back. 

Ps: make sure to walk the grounds and explore the local forestry and pathways that lead to many little escapes, even the waterfall is not far away. ",5,2016,07,11
217,A wonderful hotel !,"My husband and I enjoyed our 35th wedding anniversary at th Powerscourt Hotel. We stayed in one of their suites and all I can say is ""oh my!!! It was beyond anything we could have imagined. The room was magnificent from the furniture to the linens to the marble bathroom!! Beautiful!  The staff were all very friendly and attentive. We could not have asked for anything better. It was truly a memorable holiday!!!",5,2016,07,10
217,Unforgettable!!!,"Without a doubt, one of the most beautiful and comfortable hotel rooms we have ever stayed in!  Classy & Elegant and first class all the way!  The staff was so courteous and professional. Plus there are a variety of restaurants and bars to choose from throughout the facility. Worth every penny!",5,2016,07,08
217,Very good,"Stayed one night here to have business dinner. Impressive lobby. Check in was quick and escorted to the lift this was a nice touch. As platinum Marriott member was upgraded to a suite. Room was excellent. Nice sitting area, walk in closets, separate bedroom. However the bathroom was the stand out separate shower and bath with a small television built into the bathroom mirror was very cool. 
Fitness room was well equipped. The public areas were excellent. We ate in Sika restaurant the food and service was very good. 
I did not get a chance to explore the grounds which I here a spectacular. 

I will back with my wife to stay here. ",4,2016,07,07
217,Such a great relaxing wekeend,"Beautiful view, good food and amazing spa service. The staff are a bit cold but everything is doing perfect. With a golf area so close make it more enjoyable for any taste, family with kids, teenagers, couple and a friends day out to relax.Such a beautiful house.",5,2016,07,07
217,Best rooms on our trip.,"This is one of two Marriott properties in Ireland and it didn't disappoint. The front desk, bell staff, and valets were all very helpful and professional. Unfortunately the evening concierge didn't know much about golf so I just called the concierge in the morning and he helped me make a tee time.  We ended up getting two adjoining rooms since they didn't have a family room that would accommodate the four adults in our family. See if they have a room with a better view.",5,2016,07,06
217,Good option for Dublin visit,"We stayed here in lieu of a downtown Dublin hotel. The staff are wonderful and the grounds fabulous. The waterfall is worth the trip as are the estate grounds. Although not in the city, downtown was easily accessible by rental car. The nearby town is also charming with good restaurants. Would definitely recommend, particularly for those who enjoy the country estate experience. ",5,2016,07,06
217,Best Hotel-ever,"This hotel certainly exceeds any expectations we might have had.  They assisted in everything from organizing trout fishing to bringing an umbrella to me without my request while I was at the gardens and it began a hard rain.  We could not have asked for anything more.

The wardrobes were spacious and lighted.  The closet itself was large and had ample space for 9 pieces of luggage.  What a delight.

The breakfast was absolutely the best.  Loads of choices and each one better than the last.

The concierge, Robbie, is absolutely the tops.  

The suite was lovely, well appointed, and very comfortable.  I wanted to bring the bed home it was so great. 

Service overall was over the top.  Services were performed seemingly by magic.  

We will return again and again.",5,2016,07,06
217,Very nice family hotel in the Irish countryside.,"We traveled with our 4 children (6, 8 ,10, 12) to this hotel in June.  The rooms were adjoining and large with unusually ample closet space.  The hotel itself is quite nice although somewhat dated in appearance.  There are enough food options on-site that there is little need to travel/walk into Enniskerry or drive to Dublin.  The area of Enniskerry is about 30 minutes from Dublin.  We hiked Sugarloaf mountain and a few other nearby trails.  If we had stayed much longer, however, we probably would have grown bored of the area.  My wife and I used the spa and the services were great.",4,2016,07,05
217,Wow!!!,"I dont even know where to begin with a review on this hotel! My partner and i spent 1 night here and we didnt want to leave.  Our room was amazing,there are panels on the wall and in the beside lockers controlling heating,lighting,etc so you literally dont have to get out of bed to do anything! The bathrooms are spectacular and even have a tv in the mirror so you can watch from the bath! We had a bottle of bubbly brought to our room by Daire,he was so friendly and helpful,he popped the bottle and poured for us and said to contact him if we needed anything,definetly a credit to this hotel. We had a lovely relaxed meal and a few drinks in Mc Gills bar and restaurant in the hotel where i had the best fish and chips Ever!! The guys in the bar were great and they kept checking to see if there was anything else we needed! We absolutely loved this hotel and cant wait to go back.

John and Martina",5,2016,07,04
217,Still as good as ever...with a few thoughts!!,"It was a number of years since we stayed at this property and I'm glad to report that it is as good as ever. It's a wonderful building in a beautiful rural setting yet very close to Dublin city. Staff are professional, helpful and very friendly.

Buffet style breakfast is served until 11.00am and was wonderful.

I do have a few points.....

* Seemingly a bed turn down service is by request only. I've never come across this in a five star hotel before.

* There was no A La Carte menu in Sika restaurant, only Table D'hote. We weren't particularly hungry and didn't want a three course dinner. We made do with a main course in McGill pub which was delicious.

* The furniture in the lobby area in turning a little shabby and needs to be replaced or reupholstered. Also, the tables need a deep clean. There was lots of dust evident.

My points are probably not too important and didn't affect our enjoyment in any way. We will be back very soon.",4,2016,07,03
217,Like a Ritz-Carlton except for some nits in the service,"When I heard from my taxi driver on my way off the property that the Powerscourt had been run by the Ritz-Carlton chain until recently changing hands, things fell into place. That explained the incredibly high standards applied to the lobby (opulent with a sweeping view of the mountain), the thick-pile carpeted hallways, the elegant restaurant, the smoothly functional electric curtains in the room, the solid and elegant furniture, the comfy high-end bedding, the gleaming bathroom (two sinks, a large bathtub and a shower as well as a TV embedded in the mirror) and all the other physical aspects. The absence of the Ritz-Carlton service culture also explained the missed wake-up calls (it came 20 minutes late and then, for good measure, it came again a day later), the forgotten daily paper (did not arrive on the first two days, mysteriously appeared on the third day) and the difficulty of reaching anyone – reception, the hotel operator, anyone) on the phone. 

The physical setting of the hotel was lovely, even spectacular. There were some famous formal gardens next door (separate admission) and a lovely forest-brook-and-meadow estate open to hotel guests (you needed a pass code to enter and the gates closed at 5:30pm). I did not have enough time to walk around most of the manicured grounds but what I saw of the tall trees, rosebushes and hedgerows was pleasant indeed. 

Since I was attending a conference, I ate three breakfasts, two lunches and two dinners there. The food ranged from very good to excellent. Breakfast porridge and scones were standouts. Fruit was fresh and of the highest quality. The fish from the fish-and-chips at lunch was light and airy. Accompanying sauce was delicious. Dinner beef was a bit tough but all the appetizers (e.g. potato soup), sides (broccoli) and dessert (ice cream, marshmallow and a tiny macaroon) were very tasty. Excellent Irish breakfast tea was standard.

The room had a fridge and a tea kettle. There was instant coffee only, no espresso machine. The closet was roomy. Laundry was on the expensive side (5 EUR to launder an undershirt, 7 EUR for a T-shirt). 

The conference facility was a little stuffy and poorly lit but the “secret garden” nearby was lovely. 

Throughout my stay the staff was well-meaning and some of them delivered excellent service. The pricing was surprisingly affordable especially at the conference rate - well under 300 EUR for a very nice, upgraded room. But the spotty attention to detail leaves the hotel, though lovely, at four stars, not five.",4,2016,07,01
217,First night of honeymoon ,"This was our second time staying in powers court and decided to spend our first night on honeymoon here before leaving for the airport.
We also booked massages for two which were absolutely fantastic. My therapist was such a lovely lady and really informative.
We dined in the bar and the food was lovely as was the breakfast.

This is a beautiful hotel and we will absolutely be back again, my only slight disappointment was that when I called to book the hotel I advised we would be spending our first night on honeymoon here.The lady on the phone was lovely and said she would upgrade us to a special room due to the occasion. Having stayed in powers court before I don't think we received an upgrade as it was a pretty standard room. 

However service and the day/night was fantastic and we will definitely be back.",5,2016,06,30
217,Stunning hotel,"This hotel was amazing.  Our suite had two bathrooms, a nice living room with balcony, and an amazing master suite.  The bathroom was big and had a walk in closet.  We only stayed one night but wished we had more time there.  The grounds were amazing and there were multiple places to eat.  We ate at the pub and got nachos and fish and chips.  They were both very good.  Would definitely recommend this hotel.  They even provided a volt converter that was very nice to have.",5,2016,06,30
217,Easy to stay the whole week in this beautiful hotel,"We stayed here for a meeting and then a few days afterwards. We thoroughly enjoyed the hotel and surroundings (more than our day trip to Dublin).  Several unique and cool experiences - falconry on the hotel lawn, the impressive Powerscourt Gardens, chef's table dining at Sika, hiking up Sugerloaf mountain, proximity to the quaint town of Enniskerry, etc.  We frequented the pub in the hotel and it is true that Guinness tastes much better in Ireland. The guest services folks were fantastic prior to our arrival in setting up fun activities and maintained their excellent service throughout the week.  Travelling overseas with young children was very enjoyable at this hotel with its beautiful countryside surroundings.
The only downer was check-in day.  All guests arriving from the US will get to the hotel in the morning - tired and too early for the rooms to be ready.  I wish they had a better way to accommodate everyone as the lobby filled up with American families laying on all the couches and there was limited lunch service in the hotel so many us added hunger to our fatigue.",5,2016,06,29
217,Grand and classic splendor ,Stayed 4 nights with extraordinary comfort - the rooms were spacious and surroundings serene. Can appreciate its history as a former Ritz Carlton property. Breakfast at Zika was excellent and the spa experience was a real treat. The service was outstanding - every interaction with the staff was genuine and helpful. Highly recommended! ,5,2016,06,28
217,Good Retreat for Couples,"We stayed one night at this hotel. We were there with a 6-year old child and three adults.  The service was great, the grounds are beautiful and the food was excellent.  We also thought the rooms were wonderful, beds comfortable and the rooms were overall spacious. My only comment is that children are not allowed in the pool after 6pm and from about noon-4 pm.  I found this odd.  Maybe it is common in Ireland, but as an American, I found it a little odd.  So, if you want to avoid disappointed children, just keep this in mind.",5,2016,06,28
217,Our stay was much too short,"We started our first trip to Ireland by spending the first night in the Powerscourt Hotel. What a beautiful start to the vacation, but after the first night we were spoiled for any other hotel or inn afterwards. The room at the Powerscourt Hotel was was the epitome of ""posh"" for a hotel. Sleep was wonderful in probably the most comfortable bed I've ever slept on in a hotel, with wonderful pillows. It took my wife and I a bit of getting used to the remote controlled everything... but we loved being able to open the draperies in the morning without getting out of bed. And what a view! Service was, of course, top notch. We hope to return to Ireland again... and frequently, and will make the Powerscourt a destination on one of those visits, I'm sure.",5,2016,06,27
217,Definitely visit this hotel. Pure luxury.,"To start we drive down beautiful scenery and ground to get to the hotel, then there was a large awning to greet us with friendly helpful staff upon check in. The room was so beautiful and huge with a very large balcony facing the countryside. A suite of furniture was in the room as well with a TV in the bathroom and a button to slide closed the curtains. Luxury! Really couldn't ask for more! 
We visited for a birthday celebration and we came into the room to find a plate of mixed deserts with birthday greetings in chocolate! 

The hotel couldn't have been more helpful when it came to food as well. They had a car in hand to bring us into Enniskeery for dinner and collected us afterwards. All complementary!

This hotel is pure luxury with friendly, helpful staff and the surroundings are breathtakingly beautiful. Take time to visit this hotel.  Massive thumbs up!",5,2016,06,27
217,Magic,"We had a suite with a balcony over looking the mountains and the views were breathtaking. The room was just beautiful and so clean. The very large bathroom offers a separate shower and large bath as well as a tv in the mirror. Was the most beautiful hotel I've been to. The food, service and staff were great. I only hope I have the opportunity to visit again.",5,2016,06,27
217,Relax in Wicklow.,"Spent a couple of days relaxing in the splendid Powerscourt Hotel in Enniskerry, Co. Wicklow. Very friendly front of house staff. Room / suite very luxurious and spotlessly clean.
Really enjoyed the stay and the walk around the gardens.
Highly recommended.",5,2016,06,22
217,Dog friendly hotel  !!!! with exceptions,"the rating is based ONLY on the hotels policy regarding pets....quick review but I feel its an important one for those of you who consider your pets as part of your family and wish to take them as part of your family on holidays. My sister recommended this hotel as she was able to take her Jack Russell with her for a nice weekend break with her friends and their small dogs.
I called to make a booking and advised my dogs were coming, unfortunately they only take small dogs so I could not continue with my booking. I have 2 large dogs that are groomed regularly and as they are show dogs they are very clean and well looked after. They are extremely well behaved, gentle and quiet. I do not see any reason that they would be excluded. Its  a shame...",2,2016,06,20
217,Excellent resort,"The Powerscourt resort was a fabulous place to stay. We had one of the staff drive us around the grounds, telling us all about the different buildings and grounds. The room was wonderful and the beds a dream. We did not have reservations for Tea and they made it happen for us. What a wonderful first day in Ireland.",5,2016,06,20
217,Pure Luxury,"We stayed at Powerscourt Hotel in October 2015 for one night. The room was incredible, the service wonderful, the staff friendly but unobtrusive. We decided to have breakfast in bed since it was my birthday. We were awakened by the ring of the doorbell, yes doorbell! The breakfast was great. Could have spent the entire stay in the bathroom with the huge shower and even bigger soaking tub, watching television in the middle of the mirror over the sink! The grounds are gorgeous, there was a life size chess board outside our suite. Best night's sleep in a hotel EVER.",5,2016,06,20
217,Buzzing hotel in beautiful location,"This is my second review of the hotel after originally visiting nearly 10 years ago and I am happy that the hotel has significantly changed for the better. The rooms are great and very spacious, although it can be a bit of a walk as the hotel is so big. What was different this time was the great atmosphere and superb service. Really enjoyed the Irish pub with live music and food in the restaurant was great. The location is excellent for exploring Wicklow and the Powerscourt Gardens are 5 minutes walk away and is one of the most beautiful gardens in Ireland.",5,2016,06,19
217,Rude ,Great value vactions customer service is horrible.. they never once called me back I had to keep calling as if they hoped I would forget. We got our luggage stole in Dublin and GPS  by the time we were done with garda and found our way to powercourt hotel it was late .the hotel gave our room away (even tho  I confirmed it that morning) and told us to go to another hotel. My lil sister had what she still had in a garbage bag garda gave her and I'm pregnant..I broke down in tears. Took us another 1hr on top of the bad day we had. We didn't get there till 1230 in the am and had a flight leaving at 830am that morning.. going to call them again today bc there was a big price difference in hotels and def. Was not pleased with powercourt  hotel ,2,2016,06,17
217,Fabalicious <3,"Really fancy spot. Definitely a place to be spoilt. Was there on a ""babymoon"" before our second child arrived. Rooms are fabulous. So spacious and fancy. Beds are massive and comfy. Had one of the best nights sleep ever. Gentleman on reception desk couldn't have been more helpful. Really friendly. 
We'll definitely be back.",5,2016,06,16
217,Detox Stay,"Stayed in the Powerscourt Suite and the whole experience is just way too luxurious.
Stunning view of the mountain landscape and all the green around the area, lucky enough we had beautiful blue sky and sunshine as well.
Our suite is really elegant and spacious.
The whole environment will simply rejuvenile you.
It's only around 30 mins away from the Dublin city centre, so it can be planned as a weekend getaway too.",5,2016,06,16
217,Weekend break,"The location is only a short drive South from Dublin with motorway most of the way from Dublin airport.
Had a wonderful time in this hotel, Staff were super friendly and extremely helpful, 
Valet parking was free which is quite refreshing, as was the newspaper of choice delivered each morning. 
The restaurants had good food selections and the bar restaurant was more than adequate too.
Our room was superb, with a very comfortable bed and perfectly quiet. There is a spa and free swimming pool.
The drive to the hotel and it surrounding views were picturesque.
All in all I would highly recommend!
",5,2016,06,15
217,Fantastic hotel in picturesque Wicklow,"Myself and my wife thoroughly enjoyed our stay at the Powerscourt hotel. The views down there are amazing and the local area is very picturesque. We enjoyed some beautiful drives around the locality. We ate in the hotel and the food was excellent, both taste and presentation was to a very high standard. The staff were very friendly and welcoming. Our room was very nice, clean and very nicely designed. The view from our room was amazing.

I would highly recommend the hotel and I would not hesitate to stay here again.",5,2016,06,15
217,Elegant and Luxurious,"After a minor annoyance in the checking in process we settled into a roomy, but cozy suite with a large balcony overlooking a green space, fountain and the Irish countryside. A host of amenities are offered including a well stocked refrigerator, marble bath with a TV in the mirror and a deep soaking tub, plush beds and linens that make you want to sleep until  noon. We ate in both the dining room and pub and the menu offerings were varied and nicely presented. I did not take advantage of the spa or the golf course. The reception process seemed to be a bit unorganized, but the staff was polite and professional.",5,2016,06,12
217,Fantastic weekend away with friends,"I just spent the most wonderful weekend at Powerscourt with 7 friends, celebrating a special birthday.
The hotel is beautiful, the staff very friendly and professional (Dwayne in Housekeeping was so helpful, thank you!) and the food was excellent. There was so much to choose from at the buffet breakfast and we also had delicious food in McGills pub on Friday and Saturday evening. The live music was fantastic, I've never heard a fiddle player like it before! 
We enjoyed time in the swimming pool, sauna and steam room and walked around the beautiful gardens at Powerscourt.
I would definitely return, thank you to everyone at Powerscourt  for making my birthday so special.",5,2016,06,12
217,Best hotel we ever stayed in,"Full disclosure: stayed here on points as Marriott Rewards member and we were upgraded to a one bedroom suite. 

My wife and I cannot think of any hotel that was as nice as this one.  Great breakfast, very friendly and helpful staff, good location, beautiful setting. 

Ended up eating two excellent dinners at the hotel.  Found out that lounge serves dinner on Friday and Saturday nights. Great view with your meal. ",5,2016,06,11
217,Best hotel in Ireland,"We travelled the country for a couple of weeks and this was by far one of the best experiences we had.  This hotel treats guest properly and knows how to satisfy.
The room was fabulous, again one of our best (of 20 different hotels!)  Large, spacious, and clean.
We ate at the pub onsite and received everything we asked for (even a special request from the room service menu!)  The food was delicious and hit the spot after a long day.
Really nice and professional staff.",5,2016,06,10
217,An Irish 🍀 four-leaf find! ,"What a great mix-up blessing, finding Powerscourt! 

Our B&B booking dates in Dublin were inverted (my fault) with the euro/American month/date system and we were left without a room at 7:30pm. 
Dublin was hosting a big event and all rooms in town were booked!!! 

Early that morning, we left London on 2-metro trains, to the high speed train 2.5hr to Holyhead to catch our (SailRail) Irish ferry [Excellent Adventure -V- air] to Dublin in a taxi. {Big Day} 

We logged into wifi from the gracious B&B and being a Marriott Reward member, I checked for any Marriott Lodging in the area and up popped POWERSCOURT! 

Booked it right then, 
Hailed a cab and sped off to ""a destination unknown"" south of Dublin. 
💥Wow! We pulled into the iron gate of a huge beautiful Irish Landscaped wonderland that just blew us away. 
The awesome staff Welcomed Us and within minutes we were settled into our lovely large (non-euro size) room and felt very 😊blessed. 

🎼Our first trip to Ireland. The McGil Pub onsite below hosted a jammin live Irish band and we ordered up Bangers and Mash for the real deal and the win!!!

We loved our whole experience, staff, grounds, meals, walks to town, shopping and flavor of the beautiful Irish people. Kudos Marriott & Staff of Powerscourt. 
",5,2016,06,10
217,Beautiful Hotel,Enjoyed our stay here. Hotel is beautiful with Powerscourt Gardens within walking distance.. Rooms are spacious and comfortable. Food was great. we enjoyed the bicycles and went for a ride down by the river.,4,2016,06,08
217,This was an unexpected find,"We decided to spend some time in Ireland before meeting friends in London. The Marriott hotels have a hotel outside of Dublin, so let's go for it. From the moment we arrived it was obvious the Powerscourt was something special.  situated in the rural area of the country we took day trips to see the historic ruins, the Clift walk, even into Dublin By the train as well as the gardens. The gardens are ranked in the top three in the world. 
The people at the hotel just made you feel like family and it was the nicest place we have stayed in all our travels. That is saying something since we love to travel.",5,2016,06,06
217,Not what it used to be,"Our first visit to this fabulous hotel was in 2013 in the hotels last days of being the Ritz Carlton and since then we have been back over the years making the trip this weekend our fourth. 
Unfortunately the good days of the Ritz have sadly disappeared. Rooms are still fabulous as they always will be due to their unique design that will never go out of fashion but things have dramatically changed elsewhere. 
No door men anymore to greet you, sadly Ramsey's delicious restaurant is gone, room service seem to just let the phone ring out rather than take your order, all the staff seem to be young and getting trained in and don't seem to take heed of the older experienced staff who are some of the fine remaining qualities of the way it was and they really need to.
Maintenance upkeep is at a serious low, when you see so many light bulbs gone and unchanged it asks the question 'what else is gone?'. While the spa is ESPA run the signs of time with lack of upkeep are showing. The pool is cold and tiles are becoming loose.
There has also always been a lack of seating areas outside to enjoy any good weather (when we get it) and the beautiful scenery. While McGills pub is still a nice touch for an Irish pub away from the 5 Star scenario it's still not really enough to make you want to stay in a hotel away from Dublin that has plenty more than its share!",1,2016,06,05
217,"Amazing hotel, beautiful sights and most friendly staff","I recently visited the hotel for a conference which I was attending. The conference its self was being held in the hotel its self. This wasn't an ordinary hotel you would usually stay in when you attend a conference. The powers court  hotel is absolutely BEAUTIFUL I loved every minute of my visit. 

The rooms were absolutely stunning. The room which I stayed in was a double room which had a walk in wardrobe (the wardrobe was the size of a normal hotel hotel room itself). Opposite the walk in wardrobe there was double doors which lead you into the bathroom with a double his and her sink and a large marble bath tub! 

There was a slight mishap with my room when i arrived nothing major, when i mentioned it to the hotel staff they couldn't apologise enough, they quickly sorted the matter and were very helpful and friendly.

I cannot wait to attend this hotel again in the near future it was such a beautiful place with breathtaking surroundings and the hotel itself was well looked after.",5,2016,06,05
217,Beautiful property,"We had the pleasure of staying here for 5 nights and were pleased with the upgraded suite, helpful staff and lovely grounds.  We were glad we had rented a car for our trip as it would have been a bit of a challenge to see other parts of Ireland without our own transportation.  We drove over to Bray one day and traveled by train to Dublin.  It was a short drive and train ride into Dublin.  We also made several day trips including to Kilkenney and over the mountains to Glendalough.  Both trips were recommended by staff and we were not disappointed.  The hotel has a pub which we enjoyed each night of our stay.  The bartender and waitstaff were all friendly but very busy by the weekend.  The food in the pub was very good and we tried many items on the menu.
One issue was the lack of electrical adaptors and no USB charging stations in the room.  The room had one very large and heavy adaptor.  The in room guide said to ask for adaptors which we did but were told they no longer provided them due to their not being returned.  This was a minor inconvenience.
We are platinum elite reward members and have stayed in many Marriotts.  We think Powerscourt is one of the loveliest and recommend without hesitation.",5,2016,06,05
217,Thank You Powerscourt Hotel,"All I can say is that Robbie Smyth of the Powerscourt Hotel made our stay at the hotel so amazing!  I can't begin to describe the gratitude I have for his help in every way.  My wife and I were enjoying our 2nd year anniversary in Ireland and since it was our first time being in the country, Robbie saved us from a lot of headaches that could have been very problematic for us.  We had the mentality that we would just go anywhere our hearts desired and book hotels as we arrived in different cities, but we found out that almost every hotel we were looking at were sold out.....but Robbie pulled some strings and booked some places for us to stay based on his connections.  Not only that, but his personality was contagious and he always made my wife and I laugh!  You can't buy that back in the States and I appreciate his attitude.  Powerscourt Hotel is blessed to have this guy working for them.  I would highly recommend staying at the hotel just because of him!! Plus the rooms were absolutely gigantic, luxurious and very comfortable.  Thank you once again for making our trip so amazing.  

Sincerely, 
David & Anika R.",5,2016,06,05
217,Out of this world,"Everything about this hotel is outstanding. The staff, the rooms, the food, everything. I was upgraded to a room with a balcony and it was larger than a Chicago apartment. The bathroom was amazing. The valets will drive into town so you don't have to drive back to the hotel from the pubs. This was one of the nicest properties that I have ever stayed in and the location is in a picturesque setting with a view of the Sugarloaf mountain.",5,2016,06,04
217,A-MAZING,We had a room bigger than my first apartment and got 5-star service all the way.  The grounds are spectacular and you  need to take the time to walk them.  Breakfast was fantastic and this could be a destination anything...,5,2016,06,02
217,Annual Company Party,"My room was fab, it was a suite as I believe all the rooms are? TV in ""sitting room"", ""bedroom"" and ""bedroom"" Good size proper shower, also bath with taps on the side - great for couples, regrettably I was solo. 
It was a two night stay Friday and Saturday, we had a BBQ on Friday, wide selection of food and a nearby lively bar selling the black stuff, which has to be sampled - it would be rude not to?

The main dinner was on the Saturday. The starter was an odd salmon creation is ""gelatine"" by no means to everybody's taste.... tho my beef was fabulous, a friend on my table requested horseradish, apparently there wasn't any?? That was a little odd.

The café up the road from the hotel is a must for an afternoon cream tea, the scones are great and you help yourself to jam and cream - a stroke of genius if you ask me?
We also ate a light lunch at the golf club - excellent. I guess if you are into golf then you will be impressed as it looked good to a non-golfer

The Spa is exceptionally well equipped, the pool is unusual in that it is long enough to have a meaningful swim.

We occupied ourselves on the Saturday by walking up to Sugarbush. We took a taxi to the lower car park for the longer 150 minute walk. We were advised that it was not possible to walk back to the hotel - we did.

The best accolade I can give is that it compares very favourably to the Chewton Glen Hotel, Hampshire",5,2016,06,01
217,Bucket List,"On my visits to the Shelbourne in Dublin I was recommended this hotel if in the area. I researched the hotel and decided that I would definitely add it to my Bucket List. On arrival I was not disappointed. The drive in through the Powerscourt Estate was beautiful. I had arrived. Met with a friendly welcome and shown to our room . Beautiful, elegant, spotless and spacious. The bellboy asked if my husband and I wanted to be shown the features of the room but we declined. Had dinner in Mc Gill's , very nice in fact we ate there most nights during our 4 night stay. On returning to our room which was hot and stuffy I decided to turn on the air conditioning but I couldn't find the control panel or any form of switch. Read the guest information which clearly stated that there was a control panel either in the entrance or bedside table. None to be found. Phoned reception and again was informed that the touch sensor panel was where it was stated in the in room information. The girl asked me my room number and then informed me that that room at 290 euro on that night did not have a means of working the air conditioning independently but that she would get an engineer to switch it on and when I wanted it adjusted just to ring and let them know. I couldn't believe it. There were no other rooms available at the same category with the said device.After offering an upgrade at a further cost I refused and she passed the problem over to the duty manager who eventually did upgrade us to a suite. This room had the ability to control the air conditioning  but was not as polished as the other room. Scores on the wooden flooring and mould in the shower. Breakfast was chaotic and on each of the 4 mornings I asked for brown toast I only received it once. Waiters not listening. Not a fan of a buffet breakfast for hot items and no menu for a la Carte was presented. Also linen napkins should be the order of the day in a 5 * hotel. You could do well to emulate the Shelbourne in the breakfast they provide.Staff very friendly and I want to make a special mention to Stephen who moved us from one room to the other and for providing a cake and welcome card on day 3 after we were locked out of the room. Sadly I was a bit disappointed with my Bucket List experience.",4,2016,06,01
217,Scenic and grand!,"Before ending our Ireland trip with three days in Dublin, we stayed at the picturesque and stately Powerscourt Hotel in Enniskerry, Co. Wicklow.  Although it probably comes as no shock to locals, we were stunned by the magnificence of this Marriott  hotel.  Our king guest room with a view of the grounds, was a spectacular 4-room suite – separate dressing area and sitting area.  We ate in McGill’s bar and the service was slow and the food was just okay, so we wish we’d had time to try some of the other dining options at the hotel.  This location is really worth a 2- or 3-night stop.  The spa and exercise area are wonderful.  The Powerscourt Garden, listed among the 10 best in the world, is a leisurely walk or a very short drive and is a must see for garden lovers.",5,2016,05,29
217,2nd stay at Powerscourt,"Stayed at the wonderful Powerscourt Hotel again from May 27th until May 29th 2016. Powerscourt has to be one of the most beautiful and pleasant Hotels in the world.  Our room was just what we expected, beautiful.  The restaurants are sensational too.  We ate in both and although one was pub grub and the other fine dining, both were absolutely sensational.  The staff are just wonderful too and always have genuine smiles on their faces.  The breakfast options are perfect.  You have so much to choose from.  It's not cheap by any means yet I've travelled all over the world from UAE to Israel to China to the US and all over Europe and nothing compares to Powerscourt.  The grounds are so lovely and tranquil to walk around and you are not too far from the gardens.  We drove to Glendalough and took the scenic route over the Sally Gap.  Wow, what a way to travel to Glendalough.  The photo opportunities are endless.  When you travel to Powerscourt, so much is all around for you to see and do.  If you want quite and tranquil, you have quite and tranquil.  If you want a little more McGills bar has a great atmosphere, fab wine and food and again the staff there are just wonderful.  Enniskerry is close by too so you can always pop down there to have a walk around.  Well done Powerscourt.  You guys do it right, every time... I'd almost forgotten about the swimming pool and spa.  I was there one morning at 7am and had the pool almost to myself.  The spa was so refreshing too.  A wonderful wonderful experience.  I could not imagine this hotel ever falling below exceptional performance.",5,2016,05,29
217,Just Magnificent and Fabulous,"We have stayed in Powerscourt a number of times before, when it was a Ritz Carlton. My fear before returning was that it may have gone downhill over the last few years. Actually, the opposite is the case. The hotel has been fully renovated (even though it's only 9 years old) and looks fabulous. The rooms are beautiful, the SPA are is wonderful and does not mention probably the best setting on the east coast of Ireland. 

I should also say that it is much more relaxed than under the previous Ritz Carlton label. The staff in lobby, SPA and Restaurant were really courteous, professional and helpful.

Well done Powerscourt Team. We had a great stay and will be back as soon as possible.  What a relaxing break - could not have been better!",5,2016,05,29
217,Raised the bar!,"Overall a wonderful stay from initial greetings, being shown to luxurious rooms, room service and overall food quality. Highlights: the view, the architecture,  server Nicole in the lounge, breakfast buffet, bathrooms.
Negative: only one. Our bed was uneven and uncomfortable. Our friends loved their beds. I believe this was a one off and will regardless will stay again when we are in Ireland again.",5,2016,05,29
217,Supreme Elegance coupled with Luxury and Comfort,"My wife and I have been visiting the Powerscourt Estate since we first met in 1999. We adore the grounds and gardens. Naturally when we heard that a hotel was being built some years later we couldn't wait to visit it. The significant investment still doesn't disappoint! This is a magnificent hotel which just oozes elegance, luxury and charm. We can't recommend it enough and have been a handful of times over the years. The food and service is also impeccable and the staff go out of their way to make you feel special. Special mention to Andrew Pollock at the front desk who ensured our check-in and check-out experience was very friendly and highly professional. Thank you.

Tim & Debbie Burden",5,2016,05,28
217,Lovely country Hotel,"We had a lovely suite at this outstanding five star luxury hotel, set amidst the granite walls and ancient trees of the Powerscourt Estate.  This 200 room Palladian-style resort was quite nice. We had a delightful one bedroom suite and was most comfortable and enjoyed a delectable dinner in their fine dining room.",4,2016,05,28
217,Wonderfully special!,"If you're looking for an elegant and special place to getaway or an impressive location to host a conference, Powerscourt is the place.  The grounds and location are stunning and I would suggest taking a long walk while you're there. The rooms are luxurious and so very comfortable.  The bed, pillows and linens were heavenly and I had the best nights sleep. If you like to stay active, Powerscourt has a very nice, large indoor pool and a huge gym with one of the best selections of equipment I've seen at any hotel.  Alternatively, if relaxation is what you crave, I highly recommend the Powerscourt spa.  I didn't have time for a massage but simply enjoyed some time in the sauna & steam rooms.  Staying there was absolutely wonderful and I can't wait to go back.",5,2016,05,26
217,Simply Stunning.,"This hotel definitely has the 'Wow' factor. The hotel and grounds are spectacular. Service of a high standard and staff friendly. I was staying in a twin room with forest view, and the room was fantastic. The bathroom was beautiful with a great feature of the tv in the mirror! Wow! The bedroom itself was huge with a beautiful view. The cleanliness level was off the scale.. not a dust particles in sight. 

There were just a few points that I noticed/experienced that have prevented me from awarding 5*.

- Beautiful view to be experienced in the room with the floor to ceiling windows, just a shame they were stained and dirty! Bit disappointing when you are paying for a view.

- The technology too complicated for even tech savvy people. Struggled to negotiate the system of switching on the lights... needs a manual.

- Not enough lighting in the room. For such a large room, there were only 2 small lamps and no ceiling light. I found it strenuous to read with such dim lighting in the evening, which was irritating. My parents room which was smaller had more lighting, so this was specific to the room.

- Beautiful pool however the cleanliness levels were not up to scratch. Build up of limescale and slimy residue around the pool alongside other bits of dirt and litter were disappointing at this standard of hotel. I expected better. The whole spa are was in need of a deep clean alongside better day to day cleaning. 

Aside from these few points, I had a very pleasant stay at Powerscourt. I would highly recommend to others and look forward to returning on day!",4,2016,05,26
217,What a hotel!,"My wife and I decided to stay for a night as we departed Dublin for our trip to Ireland.  On the map it looked to be farther from Dublin than it actually was.  It seemed as if we just left Dublin and arrived at Powerscourt.  For an American the distance was close enough that we would not rule out staying there and driving into Dublin daily for sight seeing.  Parking was free and I just may suggest we stay there next year, then drive into Dublin and park in the city.  It may be less expensive to pay public parking than some of the hotel parking fees.  

I have been told in the past when you have something negative to say to someone you should give a positive - then negative - then positive.  So.....
The hotel and setting was beautiful!   I was not very impressed with the situation of the on site restaurants.  This would be my one negative about the hotel.  But, then my expectations and someone else could be very different.  So, if that's the only problem give it a shot.

The room we had was HUGE!  The bathroom was top notch, we had a walk in closet that we could open up or luggage and put everything out of sight.  This room was larger than most hotels I have ever stayed in, and did not cost anywhere as much as this room would have cost in a large city.  

As a side note - something I am starting to realize - when we book a hotel on-line for a discount most hotels have lower priced rooms and more expensive rooms.  The price is because of view or location.  The rooms we are being placed in are the less expensive, not prime location rooms.  That being said - the room we had did not have a spectacular view that many rooms would have.  BUT, frankly, at night we don't look out the windows.  AND this room was just plain HUGE.  So the view was not the best, we were not in the room much when we would have looked out the window.  

I am putting in a few photos of the interior.  I would have more but they had either my wife or myself in the photo, and I had not planned on posting photos of the room for review.  I did take a few photos of the bathroom because we are thinking of a remodel and they had a few ideas I might want to nick :-)

I would stay here again in a heart beat.",5,2016,05,26
217,Stunning Hotel & Location,"We were here whilst my partner was hosting a conference...What an amazing place to be able to visit on a work trip!

This place really is something special..

From the entrance to the hotel - to the internal decor of this place plus the spa area its truly luxury at its best. We spent almost a whole day in the spa area - had a few drinks in the downstairs bar and ate at the chefs table on one of the nights - it  really   was amazing! 

The hotel staff were extremely helpful and the food was outstanding not only in the restaurants but also the room service. The night we arrived there was a wedding taking place which looked stunning - fireworks in the evening - the view from our room looked over the acres of green which was the perfect setting in both the morning and the evening.

Although this was a short trip - if ever back in Dublin again we will definitely be staying here again.

Thanking all staff!",5,2016,05,26
217,Very special and beautifully appointed Hotel,"We have stayed in many hotels over the years, and on this trip, and this Hotel is truly magnificent.  The level of detail that has gone into it, from the construction, furnishings and soft furnishings is outstanding.  The ceilings are cornices have all  been finished to a very high level of workmaship.  There were three TVs in our room, including the one impregnated in the bathroom mirror - we've only come across this once before.  The touchpad system of controlling lights and air-con was the first time we'd come across this and it was a very efficient way of controlling different 'zones' in the room. Of course, the actual rooms are just one aspect of a hotel, but it extends to the service, food options and general ambience.  We couldn't fault it and would happily have moved it for a few days!!",5,2016,05,26
217,Outstanding!,"I was lucky enough to stay here for 2 nights on a works function. The hotel and the grounds are breathtaking. The staff cannot do enough to help you and are very attentive. Housekeeping even called our room as we didn't want it serviced on one of the days, to see if we were ok and if there was anything that they could do for us or if we needed anything. Absolutely fabulous and if you get chance, stay. You are about a 50 min drive from Dublin airport but there are enough sites to visit locally if you so wished. Thank you Powerscourt. ",5,2016,05,25
217,Very inviting and beautiful setting,"We were upgraded to a suite for our 5 night stay. The hotel and grounds are very comfortable and luxurious. Dinner at the fine dining restaurant was $200 for two. Other options are available. The onsite pub had good food and an atmosphere that you expect. Dinner for two was $75. Breakfast was included, options were plentiful, but was a rushed affair with many waiting in line. Every member of the staff hotel wide  was exceptional. This would be a difficult place to stay without a car. The train into Dublin is about three miles from the hotel and takes 30 minutes.",5,2016,05,24
217,So Welcoming/So Beautiful/So Grand,"My first trip to Ireland, and I stayed for the first two night at Marriott's splendid Powerscourt Hotel, just 30 minutes from the Dublin Airport. Beautifully appointed, spacious room; a deluxe bathroom (deep tub/hot water)--with a TV IN the big mirror (!!!!); and enough closets to live in. Gracious lobby with its beautiful Sugar Loaf Cafe (views in all directions) and superb maitre d', Mr. Jose Gomez, who made me feel so very welcomed. Another special shout out to Dawn Byrne  (Reservations Manager) for magically clearing up a booking snafu. Make sure to visit the superb gardens next door. The 10 euros admission is so worth it--as is a meal in the cafe. What a wonderful introduction to Ireland.",5,2016,05,23
217,Amazing,"This is an amazing hotel, one of the nicest ones we've ever stayed at. The rooms are unique, all with a view of a garden or the Wicklow mountains. They have ""ipad"" type pads that control all the lights, heat, etc.  There is even a TV behind the mirror in the bathroom.  The grounds and gardens surrounding it are wonderful.  A great place to go for a hike.  The staff was very helpful, especially the concierges.  
  The Powerscourt Gardens and Manor House is just a 5 minute walk away, and though not owned by the hotel is on the grounds.   The Manor House has a wonderful cafe for breakfast and lunch and some cute Irish shops.",5,2016,05,23
217,You will not be disappointed,"This hotel is a seriously beautiful,service perfect ,staff lovely and rooms are beautify decorated to a very high standard,you will feel like royalty when you arrive here .there is secluded in spectacular grounds ,with spa facilities ,golf course ,if you want a hotel just to relax and have peace and quiet this is a perfect hotel .you can spend time just walking round the grounds and gardens,for a nice walks to switch off from everyday life and appreciate this magnificent hotel , we will definitely go back again .",5,2016,05,22
217,"superb property in a magnificent landscape,Difficult to find,sat-nav will drive you crazy.","A really beautiful building,but upside down.A 5 story building and you arrive at the 4th floor entrance.Here you find a hugh public lounge and reception.There are lifts on either side of the lounge,don't mix them up,they serve different purposes.Everything is magnificent in this building.right down to the bedroom doors.The bedrooms are huge and the bathrooms complete with separate toilet and shower rooms,truly superb.Staff are very friendly and the food is very good.The only drawback for the single traveller is the lounge bar,which is hidden away out of sight and has seating, only for two people.

217,A little piece of heaven ! Hidden Gem,"We stayed in Powerscourt for a long weekend, fantastic location. We had a suite with a view of the mountains.

Staff were very attentive and the spa and leisure facilities were outstanding

We both cannot wait until are next visit

Fantastic little gem worth visiting",5,2016,05,19
217,short stay,. could not find any fault with this hotel.  staff were excellent in every way special mention for porters and wonderful breakfast staff.    food was excellent  rooms beautiful spotless and large. lovely spotless bathrooms great grounds and views the dinner menu was top class good choice and nice little extras all in all a really beautiful 5 star hotel  will be back.  .,5,2016,05,19
217,There are no words...,"I loved everything about this hotel, the grounds, the atmosphere, the people,  the rooms. It's worth every penny. We stayed in a suite and it was beautiful. It even has its own outdoor hot tub as well as everything else. Unfortunately, it was too cold outside to use it. We got room service and the food was fabulous too. Couldn't find a few bits so had to ring for help and they were so polite, nothing was too much or too little which I think is the backbone of good Irish hotels. 

The real selling point for me was the atmosphere in the lobby. It was a lovely mix of clientele and everyone was so chilled and relaxed.  Will definitely be back soon. Thanks guys. Keep up the good work. ",5,2016,05,18
217,Upmarket place with insecure staff,"We got lost, looking for the Powercourt House and gardens and ended up in this palace like hotel/spa on the same estate. We had coffees and scones and felt a bit lost in the vastness of this establishment. The gerant was French and the waitress a nice, but insecure Polish woman. The toilet was posh but the toiletseat was losse. The entrance was of bronze/gold plate, but was with the glass full of stains and greasy fingers.",3,2016,05,18
217,Exquisite Service in a gorgeous setting,"I had a lovely time at Powercourt Hotel.  The setting is spectacular -- right on the edge of a huge garden, nestled atop  a valley with a stunning view.  The hotel itself features large suites, mine had a balcony, and are both comfortable and roomy.  There are little touches -- like the towels and water bottles  they place in the lobby for runners -- that make it extra nice.  And the concierge, Lezette, was simply amazing.  She printed up maps for me and delivered them to my room after giving me extensive advice on sightseeing. This place is terrific!",5,2016,05,18
217,Tag Along,"I recently tagged along with my sister on her business conference. The food (especially breakfast) was fabulous. We were really impressed with how good our food was in the hotel pub. The bathroom and dressing room were huge and the staff was very helpful. The grounds were beautiful.

The pool is very interesting and worth checking out but we felt even the hot tub was too cold for indoors. The exercise room was the best I have ever seen although I chose to walk the grounds instead. 

Our room was a little hot for sleeping at night and the thermostat controls was hidden in a drawer. I feel it is best suited for adults and wouldn't have enjoyed myself as much with my kids. ",5,2016,05,18
217,Fantastic!,"This hotel, with its professional staff and impeccable service was the perfect location to celebrate our wedding anniversary. There was no stone left unturned for guests and for any Eurovision fans, music in the restaurant was provided by former Rock n Roll Kid.....fantastic!",5,2016,05,18
217,Fab Birthday Treat,"For a Birthday treat myself and the hubbie headed away for a one night stay and upgraded to a mountain view corner suite. Wow! Room was excellent, immaculately presented and very comfortable...particularly loved watching the TV in the bathroom while soaking in the huge marble bath having a glass of champers! For such a large and busy hotel it has very friendly welcoming staff. It's a great location for walks, scenery and relaxing. Food was local, in season and very good.  Would def recommend a visit.",4,2016,05,17
217,You need to stay here,"Beautiful spacious rooms.Amazing views .Couldn't have asked for a more perfect location .
The powerscourt gardens next door are an added bonus with amazing views the house and gardens are spectacular .Very child friendly.Lovely Staff.All in all a perfect stay.
Also the pool and spa are wonderful.",5,2016,05,17
217,Amazing,"The Hotel is beautiful. I was quite surprised by the room I was given as it was spacious and amazing view from the terrace. The bed was so comfortable and big. Also the decor of the bathroom was beautiful. We spent some time in the pool and its very luxurious. The breakfast the next morning was delightful. I haven't a bad word to say of the hotel, simply amazing.",5,2016,05,16
217,Ultimate luxury surrounded by natural beauty,"We recently spent four awesome days at this resort and are not likely to forget the comfort, mountain-view suite, breakfast spread, excellent service, and the natural beauty surrounding the hotel.  During our stay we received exceptional service from Brian, Stephen, Ruth, and Christina at the reception desk and Robbie, concierge.  Restaurant and housekeeping staff were all friendly and efficient.  The hotel is secluded but guests can walk to the nearby Powerscourt Estate (shops) and well-known extensive gardens, and the hotel offers free transportation to the village of Enniskerry where there are several restaurants, shops, and a bus stop to take people to other nearby destinations.  Taxis, while rather expensive, are also readily available.  A Wicklow Mountains tour bus picks up passengers at the hotel for a day trip to Glendalough and other scenic attractions.  We enjoyed two meals in McGill's Pub.  The hotel includes a pool, sauna, steam room, and hot tub.  Wifi is free.  On our arrival, our bellman carefully explained how to work the unique electronic panels that control lights and temperature.  We highly recommend this hotel for a relaxing getaway.",5,2016,05,15
217,Doesn't meet 5-star expectations,"Stayed at 12 hotels/B&Bs on a trip around Ireland. This was the poshest of the 12, however if I ranked them by experience, this would be close to the bottom.

One thing I noticed is that everything looks lovely on first impression. The elevators, hallways, room fixings. However, that impression changes quickly once you've had more time to actually experience the place. It's only when I'm writing this review that I'm noticing that this used to be the Ritz-Carlton. My guess is that when the Ritz-Carlton management moved out, they took movable items like beds, furniture, fridges with them. 

Several complaints listed below, but in summary, there were lots of shortcomings that any other professional 5-star hotel management would never overlook. If it was a 3-star hotel I would give a higher rating, but who wants a 3-star experience at 5-star prices?

- Starting with the bed as that is a hotel's #1 job. The mattress was the cheap unstable type. Any small movement by the other person would cause the entire mattress to wobble violently. The last time I wrote this complaint on Tripadvisor, it was a cheap hotel in Bangkok that I only stayed at to be with friends.

- Called room service. Experience at other 5-star hotels has set my expectations to have the phone answered on first ring. Room service not only did not pick up on first ring, they did not pick up at all! I waited until the phone hung up on me twice before I called the front desk instead. Front desk put me on hold (so essentially 3X wait) and could not get through either, finally they took my order for me and I'm assuming someone had to go communicate the order in person.

- The food was terrible. Apparently ""chicken noodle soup"" and ""teriyaki soba noodles"" are exactly the same thing. We had inadvertently ordered 2 portions of the same thing. You would expect the former to be wet, the latter to be dry. Nope they were both exactly the same thing, consistency at the mid-point between wet and dry. ""Baked camembert"" was just regular cold ""camembert"" with a fancy sprig of rosemary stuck in it.

- The air-conditioning could not be turned on. Each time I changed the fan speed and temperature setting using the touch-screen console, the settings would revert to the default the next time I opened them. They sent someone up to help. He poked about at the touch-screen console for a bit, then said to wait 10 minutes for the air-conditioning to come on (what?!?) Of course, it never came on. Had to drop the issue because we didn't want people in our room. Luckily I had my portable fan which I had brought along for the trip to use at the B&Bs.

- The desk chair was the most uncomfortable chair I have ever sat on. The back of the chair grinds into my back. I have sat in similar chairs with a center panel (oriental style hard chairs) but they weren't this uncomfortable. 

- The bedroom slippers and towels are the cheap kind. Bedroom slippers - thin, flimsy and not sealed at the toes. Towels - the small type (wrapped, they end above the knees - usually at 5-star hotels they end below my knees)

- One of the racks on the fridge door was broken. Opened the fridge and glass bottles came tumbling out on the floor.

- When checking out, the front desk person asked me if I had prepaid or not. He genuinely could not tell from the system data. He was very polite about it and all, but process-wise this was baffling. The story is that I had booked a prepaid room rate, but for some reason they had a wrong card number on my account (the last 4 digits he gave me did not correspond with any of my cards) and so had not been able to charge it. It's crazy that they hadn't a process in place to resolve this in the weeks between my booking and stay. It was a long check-out while he fiddled with the computer and I had to pull up my mobile banking app to verify whether I had been charged. At the other 11 places I stayed at in Ireland, checking out was a matter of turning in the room keys and sailing out. 

Finally, this has nothing to do with the hotel but is a reason people might choose to stay there: Powerscourt as an attraction was a terrible letdown. There are the gardens and the waterfall. We went to the waterfall first and paid 6 euros each to basically visit a glorified tailgating parking lot. We then went to the gardens, and fresh from the disappointment of the parking lot oh I meant waterfall, we couldn't bear to pay 9 euros each to go in, so we skipped it.",2,2016,05,13
217,Stunning,"We stayed at Powerscout for a week. My partner was working in the central city so I got to enjoy this beautiful hotel. Gym and classes were of a great standard and available at no charge. Gardens a great casual relaxing walk after breakfast. Staff incredibly friendly. 
Food first rate and the exercise options boundless - a must do is a run around the river walk. I'm new to golf so I popped over to the golf course opposite and had lessons with their resident PGA  golf instructor Paul. This is also a must do regardless of your golfing experience. Polite, experienced and just a joy to have lessons from. All in all, amazing hotel, staff and experience. I can't wait to go back!!!",5,2016,05,12
217,OK with a few little missings,"First visit here, and will be honest and say I had received a gift voucher, so used that as a basis for an over night stay.  The hotel is impressive on arrival. We were told we were upgraded to a superior room - everyone seems to be upgraded if the reviews are correct?  The room was lovely - no view though - was pristinely cleaned and I really liked the bathroom. The staff were friendly on arrival. 

We went for a walk around the gardens which were lovely. Checked out the swimming pool. One of the nicest hotel swimming pools I have been to. As we had eaten a late lunch, we decided to eat in McGills Bar later that evening. I have to say a major let down visually and for atmosphere.  It's basically a square room, a few dividers, tv's everywhere. Food was good, expensive though for sitting in what looked like a basement.  As it was a Sunday, the bar upstairs was closed from 6 p.m.  A bit disappointing as I wouldn't be inclined to linger in McGills for any longer than necessary.

Breakfast the next morning was in The Sika Restaurant. The Tea was abysmal - not sure, but tea pots seemed to be filled from hot water flasks?  Water definitely wasn't boiled anyway. Asked for poached eggs and toast ( you have to ask for toast, Staff did not ask whether you wanted any automatically.). After 15 minutes I had to ask another member of staff for the poached eggs and toast again.  Got the eggs, however had to wait another 5 minutes for the toast. I've had much better breakfasts' in many 4* & other 5* hotels. Very disappointing. Also, the girl in charge on calling everyone ""my dear"" was grating. Sir or madam is a much more appropriate way to address guests in my opinion.  

One other small point, on check-in, we were asked if we'd like a free paper in the morning, to which we said please.  No paper was left for us.  A small niggle however should not have happened in a 5* Hotel.

Beautifully located hotel, no doubt. An ok stay.  A bit disappointing overall, as my other half is self-employed and trying to get him away for a night is a major achievement. I was hoping for a fantastic experience, however got an ok one. ",3,2016,05,09
217,Best room I have ever stayed in,The last night of our tour of Ireland was spent at the powerscourt hotel. It was AMAZING. I asked the front desk if we could have a view of the mountains and she upgraded my wife and I to a mountain view suite. Hands down the best room we have ever stayed in. Also the pub @ the hotel has fantastic fish and chips.,5,2016,05,09
217,Pure luxury!,"This place is heavenly! pure decadence from the moment you walk into the lobby, to the rooms (TV in the mirror in the bathroom!!!), to the spa, to the bar.  its a proper 5 star establishment, made all the better by the lovely staff.  all very helpful and pleasant, nothing is too much trouble - even when the zip on my friend's dress broke, the housekeeping staff tried sewing it for her, before going out and purchasing an alternative for her to wear to a function! 
We had a standard double/twin room, it was massive, it had a separate little room/alcove for the luggage and wardrobes and the bathroom was the size of my living room at home!
I stayed here for 2 nights with a few friends, I regret not booking it for longer.  I will definitely be back soon!",5,2016,05,09
217,"Nice facility, but not a 5* service experience","Real nice facility, but maintenance status is not up to date in all areas. In my room (#522) the windows had been really dirty, so the park view had some drawbacks due to that. In general however, a really nice place to spend some leisure time.

This however is contradicted by some of the staff members, which clearly are far away from 5* hospitality. Just one example:

When entering the restaurant for breakfast on my first morning, the staff at entrance just tells me to find a table on my own, I could sit where I want. The lady clearly was not much in mood to serve and guide me to my table. Later, when I had chosen a table that was available according to my observation, she came to me when just sipping my coffee and started shouting at me that I had taken somebody else's table. Well, I haven't seen that and I would have been very sorry for that. But shouting and blaming your guests in front of other guests? Just do your job right!

Moreover the breakfast buffet is clearly not 5* standard. All cheese and ham seem to come right from the next supermarket. The butter is not served on ice, therefore almost melted. The variety of food is really limited, nothing's cooked fresh. To get some coffee you need to actively ask the waiter, he or she will not proactively ask you. The coffee pots will just be refilled when taken from one guest to the next one - cleaning seems to be not seen necessary. The waiter just wipes away some stains on the outside ... with some rag flying around. Really disgusting!

So as a summary, the hotel is a nice spot, but service level is far away from 5*. Don't expect too much.",3,2016,05,09
217,Nice quality service with amazing spa,I've stayed at this 5 star hotel several times now. Also have stayed at the Shelbourne Hotel. The establishment is set in the Wicklow mountains that adds charm and a sense of serenity. This hotel was once the ritz Carlton. Powerscourt hotel guest get access to a private bike trail and river walk. The hotel is located in a small town of enniskerry. Only 20-30min drive from Dublin. The spa must not be missed and there is a great indoor pool with a large gym.,5,2016,05,08
217,Wonderful stay at Powerscourt Hotel,"The Powerscourt is truly a 5-star hotel in a great location.  Near the hotel just a short walk away is the Powerscourt Gardens, and guests have special access to a river walk that winds its way around the outskirts of the gardens.  The hotel can act as a central base for you to explore  Counties Wicklow, Dublin and Kildare.  The hotel is located in a peaceful, quiet area and the Dublin Airport is about a 40-minute drive.  
For 230 Euros per night, we had a suite that had a king size bed, a separate living area, and a walk-in closet.  The rate also included breakfast (served in the Sika Restaurant) which had more than enough options to choose from.   Staff was helpful and professional.  If you’re looking for a place outside of the city, with plenty of things to do close by, then consider the Powerscourt Hotel.",5,2016,05,08
217,The best part of our trip,"Powerscourt Hotel was beautiful--I couldn't be happier about the fluke (searching for Marriott rewards-affiliated hotels in Ireland) that led me to go ahead and splurge a bit to book this hotel for our stay in Wicklow. It's ridiculously convenient to Dublin but the countryside definitely feels like countryside--a feeling that only improves when you eat at their wonderful Sika Restaurant and have venison while looking out on the gorgeous mountain view. This was by far the nicest--of four very classy hotels--which we stayed at in Ireland. Ask the concierge about convenient rambles nearby--not just the amazing Powerscourt Gardens, but also the waterfall and riverwalk.",5,2016,05,04
217,Great service in a peaceful location,"My wife and I stayed here over the recent bank holiday weekend.  We arrived and were impressed from the start with the level of service and attention to detail on offer from this establishment.  It was much bigger than we expected, and they were clearly very busy that weekend, but still we received excellent attention and had a wonderful stay.  Dinner in the on-site restaurant, Silka, was a real highlight.  Food and service were both exemplary!  Highly recommended for a peaceful break well away from the hustle and bustle of the city (in fact beware that a taxi to Dublin city centre costs €40 each way and that this area is not well served by public transport).  Would gladly stay again!",5,2016,05,04
217,Disappointed,"I had booked this hotel for my husband's 40th birthday. We were excited to arrive although I was slightly miffed that I had emailed the hotel to see if I could purchase a bottle of wine in advance but got no reply. Having said that when we arrived we were given an upgrade of our room. 
 The hotel itself on arrival did not have the wow factor, in fact we felt it was in drastic need of a makeover.... Needed painted, weeds everywhere, just generally shabby looking.
Food was just OK, very dismal setting staff were very friendly. Our view from our room looked into a car park and was very underwhelming.
Breakfast was fine, a little cold but when we were seated 500 metres from buffet what can you expect.
Overall v disappointed considering the price was 260 euro (not including breakfast)!",3,2016,05,01
217,Nice Hotel,"Hotel was beautiful and the spa was one of the best I've been to. I only stayed one night so I can't speak to all the amenities but my stay was comfortable and they upgraded me to a suite. SWEET! The area itself is beautiful, but not a ton to do. If you stay here, make sure to visit the powers court gardens. It was beautiful, even in March when flowers were not in bloom. Do the spa, ladies. It's amazing",4,2016,04,30
217,Nice Upgrade,"We stayed here at the end of our 11 day Ireland trip.  We were happily surprised with an upgrade to a suite.  The suite was beautiful.  The technology very modern.  Service was fabulous.  The common areas were very nice.  On our last night, we were tired and wanting to pack and rest so we ordered delivery food from an Indian restaurant in Bray and the bellboy delivered it right to our room.  Breakfast was included with our room and it was lovely and served in the Sika Restaurant.  All in all, I would recommend staying here.",5,2016,04,26
217,Favorite Hotel Ever!!!,"We were lucky enough to spend a week at the Powerscourt Hotel in late March.  Driving up to the front door we were greeted by a porter. ATILLA  He was over the top:   He was courteous and attentive.  He made us feel welcomed and for the entire week attended to all our needs. Later we were to meet his colleague, CIERAN. He was equally helpful and courteous.  They make a great team and a wonderful first impression.  
PAUL, at the front desk, was extremely accommodating of our requests for a specific type of room. All of the rooms at Powerscourt are beautiful and first class.  The suites are spacious and the mountain rooms are spectacular and look over a huge fountain on the grounds with Sugarloaf mountain in the background,
The breakfasts provided are  plentiful, with lots of variety and selections. Tea time in the lobby/dining/lounge area is a very comfortable way to spend a few hours in the afternoon.  The fresh flowers are exquisite, the décor beautiful and overall excellent ambiance.  Our dinners were well prepared with always a special presentation.  Try the fish special of the day.  You won't be disappointed.  
The bar on the main lobby floor is small but adequate and intimate.  Our bartender ALEX had a wealth of information about places to visit.  He was very knowledgeable regarding the wine selection.  He had an excellent rapport with the staff members coming to him for drink orders while carrying on a conversation with us. 
Finally, don't miss the pool and spa area.  It is 5 star. Spa prices are reasonable.  
We liked  Powerscourt so much, that since we had 3 free days at the end of our trip we returned for 3 days and 2 more nights.
The courtesy BMW that is available to go into the village of Enniskerry is a big plus.   
 We look forward to our next trip.",5,2016,04,25
217,A real 5star treat,This a true 5star hotel luxury at its best everything about the place is super I can't wait to go back  there is a fabulous spa and pool so relaxing the hotel has 3 restaurants so there is something for everyone's taste,5,2016,04,25
217,Beautiful hotel on a beautiful piece of property,"On our resent trip to Ireland we needed a place to stay close to friends in the County Wexford area.  As we are Marriott rewards members, Powerscourt was a perfect fit.  The hotel is lovely as was our beautiful room.  The gym is first rate and our included breakfast was delicious. We had dinner in the restaurant one evening and enjoyed that as well.  Our only regret was we were sight seeing and didn't really have time to enjoy all this property has to offer.",5,2016,04,25
217,Ultimate Lap of Luxury,"From the never ending manicured grounds, all suite style rooms, and first class amenities, this is the place to stay when in or near Dublin. The restaurant was great, staff was top notch, and our stay was 5 star. Right next door is the Powerscourt gardens and waterfall which are nothing short of spectacular. Only stayed 2 days, wish we had more time.",5,2016,04,25
217,"Incredible experience, wonderfully relaxing and welcoming","First impressions were great and this continued throughout our short stay. We were greeted by very welcoming and friendly staff and we got upgraded to a superior room, which was absolutely amazing. The food was outstanding and the service impeccable. I had a capsule spa and was extremely well looked after. Will definitely return when in Ireland again.",5,2016,04,25
217,Wow,"This hotel is the definition of luxury!!! Absolutely stunning. Staff couldn't do enough! Room service was just amazing- I would highly recommend the chicken wings they are delicious! Breakfast is superb so much choice, and constantly being topped up! The pub is fantastic. The atmosphere and craic is great just what you would expect! Already planning a return visit!!!",5,2016,04,25
217,"Luxury, Luxury, Luxury in a Location, Location, Location","This place just has it all going for it. Its truly a 5 star hotel with some old school charm. 
I used all of the facilities , spa, pool, country walks etc and everything is at a very high level and in the top 3 Hotels resorts in Ireland. 

Expensive but worth it if you need a break to unwind.",5,2016,04,25
217,Much improved and always beautiful,"We've stayed at the Powerscourt before (when it was a Ritz Carlton), and must say it is actually better now.  The facilities have been upgraded/updated, and the staff was very accommodating and hard working.  The only negative might be that there were not enough staff to take care of all the guests.  The ones on duty were working very hard, and extremely service minded, but seemed overwhelmed at times.  The grounds are beautiful, and even with rain/sleet while we were there, it was a beautiful setting.",4,2016,04,25
217,Wonderful relaxing experience,"I was here for the first time a few weeks ago with my sister for a relaxing weekend.  We were so impressed with the facilities and the professional friendly staff.  Our day started with a capsule spa treatment which included lunch.  This was excellent and so therapeutic.  Our room was so spacious and luxurious.  I can't eat wheat and there were excellent wheat free options for both the lunch, evening meal and breakfast. The beautiful surroundings were wonderful to walk around.  A really special weekend.",5,2016,04,24
217,Irish Country Charm a stone's throw from Dublin,"To start, I didn't want to leave.  Checked into the ESPA for the day and melted into the thermal salon and let the outside world melt away.  The rooms are perfectly appointed. A balcony overlooking the back gardens, with view to the Wicklow Mountains. The staff was professionally friendly, and accommodating. It was the perfect escape from the flotsam and jetsam of Dublin City Centre.",5,2016,04,24
217,Everything we expected and more,"After a bumpy stay at new year we decided to give Powerscourt another chance for our wedding anniversary and we were not let down!

We communicated with Brian (from Guest relations) and reservations to make sure all bookings were in place.

When we gave our name we were told we were expected! (I know all guests must be expected, but this made our mini holidays start on the right track)

All bookings (dinners) were in place and we proceeded to our room. A few minutes after arrival we were greeted with biscuits and macaroons (our little one loves the biscuits!) all this accompanied by a reception card from Brian. 

That night we had dinner at Sika - again Joel came to greet us (even if he wasn't main waiter) being pregnant there are many things I have to mind when eating at a restaurant. Joel made sure to communicate this to the Chef and I felt in safe hands!

Later that night they invited our little one to visit the kitchen to see how they prepared the dessert - he was thrilled!!

The following day we went to the swimming pool, made sure to ask Brian to recommend us some walks around the grounds. We had an amazing time! We also enjoyed to swimming pool.

Dinner that night at sugar loaf, again, was brilliant. Slept like a baby after that in those amazing beds! Excellent room size, spectacular view of the Wicklow mountains...

On our departure Brian was very attentive making sure everything as expected. He even had a treat for our boy.

We felt spoiled by everyone in there. We felt it was the experience we were expecting and even more. Will definitely be going back!!

",5,2016,04,23
217,We're do I even start AMAZING ,"We're do I even start with how fabulous this hotel is, every single thing about it is amazing from the check in right through to the check out, the rooms are just stunning so spacious and honestly just amazing.
Ma gills pub is were we ate again nothing was a problem for them I am a fussy eater so they made exactly what I asked for the guy behind the bar was so friendly and nice, we also had treatments booked in the spa, the spa it's self was beautiful,I have been to many spas in the past this one by far had the biggest and nicest treatment rooms. The pool was lovely as well although there were children in the pool making noise which was the only down fall you couldn't relax as of the noise, but the lady explained before that they allow children at certain times. 

I have stayed in the four seasons Dublin and the Shelburn before and I expected it to be on this level but it was honestly so so much more I can not rave about it enough the staff are just so wonderful in reception the spa the pub the lobby all of them great .

Clearly an excellent manager of this hotel or management team.

Will 100% be back in the near future and I can not wait . 

Defiantly worth the money .

",5,2016,04,22
217,Beautiful grounds. Love this hotel. Extremely friendly,Just very pleasant. Had a full spa treatment here. Walked around the grounds and had a delicious lunch. Everything was extremely efficient and everyone very nice. Good food and one of the better spas I've been in,5,2016,04,22
217,Wonderful birthday stay,"After a disasterous journey (flight with Air Lingus cancelled so day wasted) travelling out on my 50th birthday we finally arrived at The Powerscourt. We had missed our meal booking at The Sika but we had contacted the hotel to inform of the delay and they changed our meal time so we were able to rest a little before eating. We explained our problems on arrival and we're given a late check out to help extend our stay which was a lovely touch. Check in was easy with full explaination of the usual hold on the card and we were escorted to our suite with our baggage taken for us. The suite was fantastic - so roomy and comfortable. The marble bathrooms were beautiful. We had a view of the Sugarloaf through the trees and the fountain. We couldn't get over how much space there was or how many televisions including the one in the bathroom mirror - have never watched television in the bath whilst drinking champagne !! The dressing room was excellent with a great amount of storage, ironing board and iron, safe and large full length mirror. The bed was an extra large king size with the softest hotel pillows I have experienced and extremely comfortable. Room service brought a complimentary fruit bowl and a birthday card message. 
The meal in the Sika was lovely - the manager poured us a complimentary prosecco to make up for the awful journey which was another lovely touch. Unfortunately my rhinitis kicked in majorly and I couldn't eat the rest of the main or desert - the staff took a genuine interest in my welfare and even stood with me outside as I tried to feel better. Our waitress suggested cammomile tea to help and gave me some extra teabags to take away. I was then presented with a lovely ""Happy Birthday"" cake and told to blow the candle out and make a wish - still feeling ill we took this and the petite fours up to our room.

We used the swimming pool, sauna and hamman which are to a good standard. Lots of fresh towels but had to source a robe and footwear from reception as there were non in the lockers - we could have walked down in the robe and slippers provided in the room but didn't fancy that.
The gym is excellent and well planned out.
Breakfast was lovely with a self service buffet - lots of choice but no extra cooked items such as smoked salmon/scrambled eggs other than poached eggs as we have had in many other hotels without the 5 stars. 
The Sugarloaf lounge was closed on the Sunday evening so we went to Magills and we're pleasantly surprised - good value good and great service and not as full as expected with the closure. This closure was a disappointment as we were looking forward to sitting in the lovely lounge with a drink after a meal.
Departure was smooth with an offer to take our luggage but the hire car was a very short walk away so we declined. 
One thing of note - a full explaination of the controls for the room would be handy as we pressed the 'do not disturb' button by mistake so never received turn down service or room cleaning until we enquired - that solved the problem. Well worth the money and would love to return. ",5,2016,04,18
217,Sika restaurant is a little bit disappointing,"Powerscout hotel is in the most glorious setting so we decided to treat ourselves to a 5 star experience in the Sika restaurant. Unfortunately it really did not live up to a 5 star experience. Firstly, we were seated at a 'bench' seating so you had to sit forward on the bench while eating. Perhaps, cushions could be provided for back support. You can only opt for the set 'á la Carte' menu, so you can't just order one or two courses, so you are obliged to go for the extra courses. There was a huge gap between courses, so we missed out on the petit fours and tea/coffee at the end of the meal as members of our party were getting really tired and we had to leave.  The food was served 'luke warm',  maybe this is the way food in a 5 star restaurant is supposed to be served, but it was way too cool for me. Sadly to say not one member of our party commented or raved about the experience. We might go back for a coffee in the foyer because it is gorgeous but not to the restaurant I am afraid.",3,2016,04,15
217,A blissful weekend,"I stayed with my wife for our anniversary and splashed out on a suite.
The suite itself was beautiful which large king size bed and a TV in the bathroom mirror (yes, you read it right!). Suite itself was clean, spacious and quiet.  
I found the staff helpful, friendly and professional.  

For dinner I tried the Ox Tongue for starter and the venison for main course with a lovely matching Italian red. Service was timely with an excellent description of the different courses and ingredients used. We happily stayed at the table for near 3 hours.

Recommend if visiting for day-trip that you book tables for lunch/afternoon in advance

Regarding the ESPA spa, It was not as busy as I expected which was great. Steamroom, Sauna and relaxation room were fantastic.",5,2016,04,15
217,"Wow, What a Place!","My wife and I went over for 4 nights to this beautiful hotel.  Everything about this place is awesome!  The hotel grounds are stunning.  The restaurants are fantastic.  The rooms are huge and beautiful.  The surrounding area is wonderful as well.  A bit of a drive from Dublin, but well worth the distance!  Loved it!",5,2016,04,12
217,Ireland vacation,Five star accommodation very convenient to Dublin.  A magnificent room with two dining options.  Shuttle to Enniskerry  if you want to try the local pubs.  Visit the nearby Gardens and play both golf courses.  Staff is exceptional. No drop off in quality of service noticed since it was a Ritz Carlton last time I stayed.,5,2016,04,12
217,Mini moon ,"My husband and I stayed here last summer straight after our wedding.  This is a beautiful and relaxing hotel. We really enjoyed the pool and spa. 
The hotel grounds are lovely and so close to Powerscourt  House and gardens too.
Our suite was lovely and very spacious. 
All staff were highly professional, polite and helpful especially waiting staff and the beauty therapists in the spa. We will definitely be back. ",5,2016,04,12
217,Top notch luxury hospitality.,"For A hotel break in Ireland, it doesn't get much better than the Powerscourt. From the moment you enter the gates to the beautiful Powerscourt estate, the outside world matters no more.

The hotel is a beautiful and luxurious sight to behold, but the friendly staff and excellent service are what makes Powersourt Hotel my favourite hotel getaway.

If you can, treat yourself to a mountain view upgrade. The view of the ""Great Sugarloaf"" mountain is amazing to wake up to, and it's totally worth the extra. The bedrooms are furnished and decorated exquisitely and the bed is ridiculously comfy.  

Make sure to head to McGills Irish Pub downstairs for a decent pint of Guinness and delicious pub grub. Next day afternoon tea is also a must. The only problem is you won't want to leave.

I can't recommend this place enough.
",5,2016,04,11
217,Luxurious feeling from the the monument you set foot inside.,"Room was spacious and quite, the bed was extremely comfortable. There was a wonderful touch control system for lights, aircon and music. The surroundings are spectacular, with a fantastic choice of things to do, Spa treatments,golf, walks, cycling,shopping.
Food in the Sugar Loaf lounge was really good, drinks are a bit expensive.
You really get a feeling of luxury from the moment you walk in.
I will definitely be returning to this hotel soon.",5,2016,04,10
217,Lovely lunch,"Popped into powerscourt for lunch yesterday and went into the sugarloaf lounge to relax and have a bite.
Got a table and with the sun shining the view out onto the sugarloaf was beautiful. Had a quick
Look at the menu and decided on the seafood chowder. Beautiful big bowl of chowder came out accompanied by a selection of bread. The only downside was the white bread was a little stale which surprised me but the chowder was absolutely delicious! Lovely chunks of fish in a really tasty broth.
Finished off and relaxed with a coffee which again with so many places serving bad coffee these days this place serves great coffee.
5 stars all the way ",5,2016,04,08
217,Comfortable hotel in the Wicklow hills,"Stayed at the hotel for a couple of nights in April 2016. The hotel is finished to a high standard and the staff were very good. The rooms were comfy and the gym was excellent. I ate in the on site pub most evenings and the food was good... There were plenty of higher end restaurants but I didn't try them out. I had a meal in the golf club across the road one evening which I enjoyed.

The grounds were pleasant and relaxing, and there was a excellent plant nursery close by if gardening and landscaping is of interest to you.

So, a nice place to go stay if you want a few days to chill and relax.",5,2016,04,08
217,Lovely ,"Powerscourt hotel

Superb, stunning hotel. Brilliant location. Room was incredible, spacious, beautiful mountain views. Really relaxing honeymoon. Staff are friendly. Hotel is a great base for visiting Powerscourt house and gardens, Bray, Glendalough, Wicklow gap etc. Very enjoyable stay.",5,2016,04,07
217,Nice spot for a weekend break,"Stayed here for 2 nights in March 2014 (sorry for the late review!) with my partner. We had wanted a nice hotel just to relax in for a couple of days & this suited us for that purpose. The grounds are lovely to stroll around & the food & service we experienced was good. The room was also nice - with a seating area & large bathroom, although there was a huge desk in the middle of the room which seemed very strange & totally unnecessary! Didn't avail of the spa. Dont really feel like it's quite a 5 star hotel but still a very nice option.",4,2016,04,06
217,Irish Hospitality at it's Best!,Where can I start.... The customer service at this hotel is 5 star for sure.  From the moment you enter the front door the staff greets you with a warm welcome and makes you feel as if you have come back to see a dear friend!  The rooms are well appointed and the beds are a dream to sleep in!!! I truly enjoyed the spa and totally relaxed in the steam room.  BRAVO!!! Can't wait to stay here again....,5,2016,04,06
217,"good facilities, lovely views, slow service","This hotel is about 10 years old so very modern, the rooms are bigger than most hotels and some are overlooking the beautiful sugarloaf mountains. The Spa is lovely but very expensive. we stayed on a weekend getaway and had a lovely experience. They have an irish bar with good bar food and a lovely restaurant overlooking the mountains. The Spa has a pool with cristals that reflect on the ceiling. 

You need a car to get here but there's plenty of activities to do: horse riding, visiting the powerscourt garden and they have a golf course.

The only complaint i had was the service as it was rather slow both in the bar and in the restaurant.",4,2016,04,05
217,Best in Ireland ,"We have just enjoyed a two night stay at Powerscourt and I must say, it really is the best in Ireland - it's a proper country house estate that wouldn't be out of place anywhere in the world. 

Hotels in Ireland (like France and other European destinations) aren't at the same high level as London or the Middle East - they aren't as polished and the attention to detail just isn't there - BUT at Powerscourt you simply do not mind; everything else is just right.

The location is stunning. We will be back!",5,2016,04,05
217,Fantastic stay ,"First time to stay in Powerscourt stayed over Easter with wife and parents found the whole experience  awesome this hotel is second to none.From the second we dropped off our bags until we booked out the staff were so professional,and helpful.The facilities are fantastic from the spa, pool, and gym. Unfortunately we had not enough time to visit the Powerscourt house gardens or waterfall but will be returning to do this some day soon. Thanks to all the staff for a wonderful stay ",5,2016,04,03
217,Christening event at Powerscourt hotel ,"Thank you very much to siobhan walsh, Aidan and Charlie for such a great day yesterday in the hotel for my daughters christening. The function room was very well planned out and it allowed for my elderly guests to relax and mingle at ease with other guests. The food quality and service was excellent and Charlie ensured that everyone had enough to eat and drink. I would be happy to recommend the hotel for an event such as this in the future. Well done to all and thank you. ",5,2016,04,03
217,Out of this world,"My partner and I spent a few days here over Easter break and it was absolutely beautiful.
The views from the hotel were amazing and the hotel room was probably the best I have ever stayed in.
The food was very good.

The spa was equally fantastic, very serene and relaxing.

The only downfall is the distance from the centre, apart from that, perfect romantic break",5,2016,04,01
217,Stunning,"Spent one night with friends and this is a stunning hotel.  Was there about 2 years ago when it was run by the ritz Charlton.  It has lost a little bit of its prestigious feeling without that famous ritz Carlton badge I feel but still an outstanding hotel. Still dislike mcgills. They should have a stylish bar rather than a sad Irish themed effort but still serves good food and beer. 

Restaurant is amazing . Breakfast superb and rooms are beautiful though the bathroom soaps etc need to be upgraded to be 5 star. Defo I will be back . Thank you ",5,2016,03,30
217,Luxury hotel in beautiful location but..,"Mostly positive things to say about this luxury hotel.The surroundings are beautiful, staff are friendly, bedrooms are really comfortable and there was an excellent choice at breakfast. Some minor issues,
1. TV's in bedroom/suite had very poor sound quality
2. Had a spa treatment but it was definitely shorter than it should of been and therapist wasn't that skilled
3. Magills ( the bar) lacking in atmosphere",4,2016,03,29
217,Really Relaxing Stay,Stayed one night in the hotel for my husbands 40th birthday. I got a good deal on B&B evening meal and spa treatments. For the same price other hotels of similar standards were only offering b&b and dinner. So we got great value. Our welcome into the hotel was very nice and a lovely lady saw us to our room and explained all we needed to know about the hotel. The hotel and location is beautiful. Room was beautiful and the bed was very comfortable. Pool etc was very nice as well as the spa treatments. The products they use are really nice. I was literally dragged away from buying the products by the hubby (love lotions & potions). As we where there for my husbands 40th I did mention this when booking. He got a birthday card and fruit basket to the room. Nice gesture but I was disappointed. A fruit basket !!! he was 40 not 90. (No offence to 90 yr old's) A complimentary drink with his meal (eg. glass of prosecco) would have been a nice gesture. Breakfast the next morning was beautiful and a beautiful selection of food was available. We had lunch in the hotel and again it was very tasty. This hotel is well worth treating yourself to especially if they have deals on for a 1 or 2 night stay.,4,2016,03,28
217,Beautiful Hotel and surroundings - experience not quite 5 star,"Hotel is in a stunning location with luxurious rooms. Not a great first impression as when we were checked in to our room it was obvious that someone had been smoking in it. Took a couple of attempts at reception to get moved as the hotel was full. Bar downstairs is good for food and atmosphere. Lobby restaurant is also nice. The only issues were breakfast - a buffet, no table service and it was pretty crazy with kids running about; the Spa - we only stayed 10 mins as it was full of kids in the swimming pool, so not really the typical spa experience you would expect of a hotel of this standard. Overall the hotel is lovely, though it seems to be geared more towards families than a 5 star luxury experience.",4,2016,03,28
217,HIGHLY recommended!,"We were fortunate to have dined here on 3 occasions within a week, culminating in Christmas Day.

1st occasion was a business dinner in the SIKA restaurant, which was delicious. We were so impressed with the decor for Christmas that we decided to book for another dinner for just my Wife and I and our Daughter 2 days prior to Christmas Day so She could experience the decor and lights. Something that impressed us on that 2nd occasion was that the menu that was presented to us was identical as to what was advertised online.

The third occasion was unplanned. We were visiting relatives near Enniskerry on Christmas Day, but we were too early. We had no idea where to go to waste away an hour, and we tried the Hotel to see if we could get coffee. Nothing was a problem for the waiters, they found us a table, and I can honestly say the atmosphere was simply superb - so much so we are thinking of spending Christmas there ourselves later this year. There was even a Santa going around, and He gave our Daughter a small present, which was totally not expected.

Truly a fabulous experience and we will certainly be back.",5,2016,03,28
217,Return visit even better than the first.,"We went to Powerscourt hotel over the Easter weekend for a relaxing night away. Our room was a beautiful mountain view suite. The scenery was magnificent. The room was so spacious and comfortable and a delight to relax in. 

We used the gym which is very well furnished with equipment. Following that the pool and spa area is a calm relaxing treat to visit. 

One of the things I really love about Powerscourt is their selection of delicious vegetarian food. Wether eating in the bar or restaurant the choice is wonderful. Even the meaty dishes look hearty and tempting and all were great value. My favourite part of a Powerscourt stay is the breakfast. Do not get breakfast in bed, drag yourself down to the restaurant and feast your eyes on the delicious selection on offer. Tip: the granola and yogurt mix is to die for. 

If you are looking for a lovely, relaxing, indulgent night away with friendly helpful staff always ready to help then this is the place for you.",5,2016,03,28
217,Downhill,"Disappointing as the Powerscourt was previously my favorite hotel in Europe.  Came for a night before flying to Mauritius, thought it would be a nice way to get the trip off on the right foot.  Unfortunately, a collection of mistakes that you would not expect at a hotel like this.  First, on check in, we had booked two 2Xdouble rooms, back in September (for a late March stay).  When checking in was told one was a king room.  A few hours later they did get us a second double a few hours later but they were on different floors so our family was split up.

Second disappointment was as we were having lunch in their Sugarhill Cafe while waiting for the room situation to be resolved.  Was seated by the maitre d but nobody came to take our order.  He eventually took it but we did not even get our drinks (including beverages for two kids) until two other tables who had arrived later were served their full meals (yes, our meals took about 30 mins longer).  

Third disappointment was breakfast today.  The main dining room (Sika) was full so was sent upstairs, told the menu was the same.  Unfortunately, they did not have the pancake making machine upstairs that was the reason my kids wanted to come to this hotel.  I also had to search and find a waitress to get coffee for my wife (I never got tea).

While none of these experiences was a disaster, it is for a supposed five star resort.  Maybe it is the transition from Ritz to Marriott but has gone from my favorite hotel to a sad memory.",2,2016,03,27
217,Very good hotel ,"We had a very pleasant stay over Valentines weekend in the Powerscourt hotel. We booked a room overlooking the Wicklow mountains and were not disappointed with the room facilities or the view. The bed, living space and bathroom were fabulous. The restaurant staff throughout the hotel were lovely and friendly.

We did have to wait three hours from 1.30 for our room to be ready and had to go back to enquire whether it was ready as we did not receive a phonecall as the reception staff had advised they would. 

I had also mentioned that it was a birthday treat but there was nothing to show that this special request had been acknowledged. 

We would definitely return again!",4,2016,03,26
217,Disgusting,"Stayed in this hotel for one night and was really disappointed. After staying here previously I can confirm that standards have slipped immensely. 
We arrived  to the swimming pool to be greeted by it littered with used wet towels on every single bed and no dry towels available. I went into the ladies to get towels and that was worse, there must of been 30 wet towels all over the floor, the basket to dispose of towels hadn't been emptied in some time and no new towels had been replaced. I picked up what I hoped was two clean towels off a bench. The swimming pool was near empty so it wasn't overly busy. 
The pool was cold, the steam room was under construction so we couldn't use it fully, there were also no towels to use when we came out of the bucket showers so we had to wrap ourselves in our robes and dry off that way.
There seemed to be no staff around to help.

The towels in our room had holes in it, not very keeping with a 5* resort.

Breakfast was included in our room rate but when it was delivered to our room I was told that I needed to pay €60 for it and to be refunded at reception at check out. Half way through eating it I noticed MOULD on the toast. This is absolutely appalling for a hotel that prides itself on its 5* quality. 

On check out I told the receptionist about the mould and he couldn't have cared less. The answer was a shrug of the shoulders and a 'sorry about that'.

I showed him my booking confirmation which stated we shouldn't have been charged again for breakfast and he said he couldn't  refund me at reception and needed to go get the card machine from room service and he would email me my refund. Still haven't received my confirmation of my refund.

Will never stay here again. It was an absolute waste of money.",1,2016,03,26
217,Amazing property,"I can't even think of anything to complain about. The hotel is beautiful, the staff is friendly and the grounds have a lot to offer. The views are fantastic. Breakfast was very good. All around amazing place to stay. 

For those with children, be aware that the pool has somewhat limited hours for children's use. ",5,2016,03,26
217,5 Star all the way!,"To my mind, Powerscourt has always been a premium brand 5 star hotel. So it was with a little trepidation, that I arrived there to celebrate my mother's 50th birthday for a night. Could it live up to its reputation? The answer is a resounding yes and more. The grounds are stunning, check-in was seamless and the staff very friendly. Our room was upgraded on arrival, spacious and sumptuously decorated. Hotel restaurants can be a bit of a let down as they have a captive audience but not here. A beautiful 3 course menu, accompanied with amuse Bouche and petit fours, and served by an incredibly friendly and attentive waiter. I'm not usually so effusive in my praise of hotels but the powerscourt experience was truly outstanding. I look forward to returning in the future. Highly recommended. ",5,2016,03,25
217,Failed to inform us that spa is under construction,"When we bookthis hotel they failed to memtoon that the spa facilities such as the steam room and sauna where currently under renovation. We had went for a relaxing night away and didn't realise the adult spa area was the same area as the children's pool. Granted the pool is only available to children in certain hours, it wasn't the same. We also ordered poached eggs at breakfast and they arrived when we had finished. The breakfast was a self serve which I didn't expect.
Upon arrival we were upgraded. The room was very nice and very clean. We really enjoyed the dinner we got inthe relaxed atmosphere of McGills Bar but were disappointed when we had to stand at the bar to fix up our bill (we were waiting too long at the table of the staff to collect payment via card) Also to be left a few minutes waiting at the bar. It was a nice one night break but I was expecting more from a five star hotel",3,2016,03,25
217,"Indifferent staff, poor communications, room needed attention - but nice location....","We stayed here for two nights in a mountain view suite combined with a spa break. It's a nice hotel, but not 5 star for service.

The negatives:

When we arrived we had to wait 6 hours to get our room key despite asking for early check-in when we booked well in advance. We went to the spa, where we were left for 20 minutes by the receptionist while other guests who came in after us were promptly brought to the treatment rooms. We weren't given any indication of what the spa amenities were, just where the changing rooms were. Other guests shared this perspective also.

The room key was left at the spa for us, although the reception in the spa hadn't the wit to inform us of this. So unlike most hotel guests using the spa we had to change into street clothes and go to reception (the fourth time of doing so) to enquire about our room being available. This was at 6pm. We were given a replacement set of key cards at this stage.

On checking out we were over-billed by a lot, again disappointing. Not sure why in such a hotel we have to check the bill for errors.

At the same time as we were checking out another couple raised issues with their stay. We were not alone in a disappointing experience. I can't say leaving the 5 star resort was any better than the arrival – not even the courtesy of staff helping to hold the door as we got our bags out. Instead they looked on and did nothing.

The room we waited for had a damaged wooden step onto the balcony, it was splintering like someone dropped a sharp object on it. The pocket doors between the bedroom and lounge were too short by a good 2 inches meaning the doors didn't actually shut.
The TV in the lounge had it's power and cable provider cables disconnected when we arrived. Not sure why.

The pros:

The duty manager was very understanding and she managed the situation well. This was after we had asked Reception for the second time to speak with the Duty Manager (our first request was not passed on). The Duty Manager was very professional and helpful and she is a credit to the hotel.

The dinners were lovely and service was good.
The breakfast staff though were very good - they kept things moving well and the seating arrangements for couples, families and groups was well thought out.

The hotel is lovely, location is excellent and the amenities are good but there was too many things that went wrong to truly rate this stay as anything other than fair. I don't mind paying for decent service - I do however object to paying a tidy sum for poor communication and staff indifference.",3,2016,03,25
217,Simply stunning. ,"What an amazing place. It is a little out of the way. Down a few windy roads. But that lends to the charm. The building is amazing, so grand but also warm and cosy. We stayed in a suite for 4 people which was huge, with 3 massive rooms. All very tastefully decorated and well stocked. We had a estate view as opposed to garden view, which means not much to see out the enormous Windows but larger rooms due to the shape of the building. 
We never left the hotel for 2 days. So I can safely say the food is amazing. One of the best breakfasts on this island. And a great selection of lunch/dinner. 
The staff are excellent. Very friendly, but not overly so. Nothing was to much trouble. At the time there was also a kids club in operation, which our boys loved. 
All in all, one of the best hotels around. 
Thanks. ",5,2016,03,25
217,Two wonderful relaxing evenings,"We have returned to this hotel because it provides just what we need - a relaxing stay, luxurious surroundings and caring staff who are keen to meet our every need, all at a price significantly less that the equivalent in central Dublin. 
It was nice to be welcomed back  by Andrew at reception and the check-in procedure was fast and simple  as I had joined the Marriott rewards Scheme at the last visit. 
The room was superb and it was pleasant to note that the hotel did its best to support returning clients. It was large and spotlessly clean. We were fortunate that the allocated room had a wonderful view of the gardens and the local mountains.
We love the pool in this hotel. It is cleverly lit to create a relaxing atmosphere with comfortable loungers to rest on. It is also a constant depth which is good for unsure swimmers.  I also made good use of the steam room.
I have reviewed the restaurants elsewhere but will say here that the food was excellent. We were again welcomed and supported by Brian from Guest Relations. 
We felt we were family friends rather than paying clients.
This hotel provides a scenic place to rest either to allow a visit to Dublin or as a staging point to tour the rest of Ireland. It is easy to get to and the local stately home and garden centre provide additional attractions.",5,2016,03,24
217,Great hotel but some issues....,"We stayed her for two nights last week. Check in is at 4pm which is rather late for a hotel especially seeing that check out remains at the 12 noon norm. When verifying your credit card, they took an additional €200 off the card on top of the room charge which I understand but you are not told of this, which seems a little rude. We were not shown to our room until nearly 4.30pm, but where upgraded to a beautiful suite. The room is beautiful, but again little things need upgrading, ie the TV in the bedroom is very blinky at times and the colour and sound quality is poor. 

The bar was messy, tables not cleared or wiped down but it was St Paddies day so this can be forgiven, and the bar food was really nice. The pool are area is clean and warm and well maintained. Breakfast was chaotic on the first morning, with long waiting lines. When we were shown our table it was not completely set, missing side plates, knifes, salt and pepper & milk. All very small squabbles but also service that you do not expect from a 5*. I do also agree with a previous reviewer who says that once you check out you are no longer of any importance, and this was displayed when after I arrived home I received a emailing notifying me of a late mini bar charge. I emailed back to advise that it was fine to take this off the card on file and did make an inquiry about a book I left behind, but there was no acknowledgment of this and no email in response. Just a little disappointing and lacking that extra attention to detail. I doubt that any of this minor issues would be enough to put me off returning as it is a beautiful place, but I would hope that when we returned it was a more personal & more organized service.",4,2016,03,23
217,"Good hotel in great location, but a few flaws","We had a very nice family weekend staying here. Rooms were large and comfortable with free wifi and spacious bathrooms. I enjoyed a free upgrade. Sika restaurant was first rate and I would rate that 5* with no hesitation for dinner. Breakfasts could have been better with table service got hot dishes as standard. The estate is great got walks and it is handy for walking to the old house and gardens. So there is a lot going for the hotel if they could sort out a couple of flaws. First, the lights in the rooms are controlled by a weird mix of electronic gizmos and old fashioned switches, and it's not always clear which is which. Second, residents are excluded from the comfortable lobby bar after 10 and forced into a noisy faux pub a floor down (and given no special treatment after checkout. And third, they left a hold on my credit card days after I settled the bill and only lifted it when I called them. These are relatively minor quibbles with what is in most respects a first rate hotel, and I would recommend a stay and dining at Sika. ",4,2016,03,22
217,Classy countryside splendor,"Nestled into the countryside an hour south of Dublin, the Powerscourt Hotel has splendid views of the rolling hills and Sugarloaf Mountain in County Wicklow. The lobby and bar are stunning, with commanding views of sunrise and sunset from the wrap around floor to ceiling windows.
The rooms are elegant and comfortable with loads of space.
 It is a little confusing getting used to the layout of the hotel. Rooms one side do not lead directly to the Sika dining area even though they are on the same floor.",5,2016,03,21
217,This hotel is a total treat!,"Myself, my Mum and my sister just spent a wonderful 24 hours in the hotel. From the moment we walked in the door to the minute we left we loved it. The hotel itself is beautiful, the staff friendly and professional at all times, the spa is just fantastic with its beautiful smells filling the air. We had a suite and it was just amazing,  huge bedroom, lovely living room and gorgeous bathroom. Breakfast in the morning is really great with beautiful views of Wicklow and the sugarloaf to look out on. The hotel was full and yet everything was kept pristine, no queues for anything and staff still friendly and available to help. I'm already thinking about going back again! Well done to all involved for making this such a great stay.",5,2016,03,20
217,Gorgeous Property,"If you plan on visiting Dublin, make sure to take at least one full day to stay at the Powerscourt. Sadly, we didn't get to spend enough time here. There grounds are beyond words beautiful. The staff is knowledgeable and courteous. The rooms are comfortable and palatial. 

It is a 45 minute drive south of Dublin, so make sure to account for the transit time. 

I hear it is a great place for weddings, and I can see why. 

Awesome job Marriott!",5,2016,03,20
217,Amazing,"I came here on 7th nov 2015 just for one night with a couple of friends. There was 3 of in total and we had a suite. From the moment we walked in until the moment we left , it was all fabulous. From the food to the service and the atmosphere. We also had spa treatments and generally I would not be a huge spa fan but this spa was so amazing. It's so dark and comfortable and the smells !!!!! I had a full body massage and the girl who did it was excellent. We had dinner in Sika  restaurant which was beautiful and then went to the more traditional bar for a few drinks. But the highlight for me was the breakfast. There is so much choice and the most amazing pastries. I cannot rate this hotel highly enough. So I have booked to come back this July for 2 nights with my husband. Can't wait ",5,2016,03,18
217,Beautiful Hotel with most helpful staff,"We (5) spend a weekend here which was a surprise birthday present and very much appreciated and enjoyed by all.   We had interconnecting rooms which included living area, 2 bedrooms, dressing rooms and two fab bathrooms with separate shower and WC.  Rooms are decorated to a high standard with very comfortable beds, mini bar, tea and coffee making facilities and no noise. Breakfast selection was the best I have experienced in any 5 star hotel.  We had a fab dinner in the restaurant on one night with the most friendliest and helpful staff.  We used the spa and pool and some even availed of the complimentary bikes.  We walked to the Powerscourt Garden Centre within the grounds.  We had a fantastic weekend and cant wait to go back.",5,2016,03,18
217,Powerscourt amazing place ,"Myself and my husband stayed in the hotel Last Sunday night, it was a beautiful hotel surrounded by amazing views all around the hotel, the hotel staff were very helpful and friendly and the bar food was delicious the room was luxurious and I felt like a queen in this beautiful hotel. This next day we had breakfast looking out at the amazing scenery.  I was booked into the spa for a treatment with Anne who looked after me, I was booked in for the escape treatment which was a back shoulder and mini facial it was amazing and felt very relaxed.  The whole spa experience was fantastic and I will definitely go back for more treatments with Anne. ",5,2016,03,18
217,Birthday Break Away,"It was a surprise from my sisters and it was a gorgeous surprise. It's a beautiful location in the most beautiful surroundings.  We took advantage of their free bikes and cycled the river path. I am glad they warned us about the hills on the way back put it was worth it.  we had a good laugh. 
We ate in the restaurant, lounge,  ordered room service  and had lunch in the spa.  All food was fabulous.  
All staff were very friendly.  
I haven't a bad point to say about the place.",4,2016,03,15
217,A quality calm and peaceful hotel in the middle of paradise!,"We hadn't planned to book into the renamed Powers Court hotel in the grounds of Powerscourt estate but decided at the last minute to try our luck. Being winter time and mid week, we felt sure that it would be no problem getting a room BUT found it fully booked! We nevertheless spent a great morning having  tea and scones in the lounge followed by a tour of the property by the very helpful and friendly staff. The spa and leisure centre is well appointed and the ambience is quite, peaceful and quality. We had an excellent lunch and found the entire property to be exactly what we expected (only better!)  Just a pity we didn't have the foresight to book in advance. We will be back! A great location with access to a fine gold course on the estate along with Powerscourt house which is a dream! This is a special long weekend retreat location for a spa and golf break.",4,2016,03,15
217,Lovely ,"Nice hotel, welcoming staff, good food and live music.  Room very clean and comfortable but no tea or coffee facilities or glass for a drink.  Good choice of food, nice breakfast and friendly service.  Good location for mountains and walking.  ",3,2016,03,14
217,Priced like 5 stars but quality little be below,"I've been there with my family for 1 nights only.Rooms are huge, well furnished,breakfast was little bit disappointing, salmon was finish and wasn't replaced at all, I presume we exceeded our daily limit,next to hotel you can find nice garden belong to hotel but unfortunately even if you are customer of this hotel you need to spend extra money to go there. I have to admit that this what it makes me change my opinion about this hotel.",3,2016,03,14
217,Outstanding location and service to match!,"My wife and I stayed here for one night recently.  Our room overlooked the back of the Hotel and the wonderful view of the Sugarloaf Mountain.  It was a beautiful Spring day so the bright colours enhanced the natural setting.  We found the check-in experience excellent as were all the staff we encountered during our short stay.  Good manners and a smile go a long way!  We explored the River Walk which is also a Fitness and Jogging Trail and checked out the nearby Garden Centre.  We later ate in the McGill Pub before meeting up with friends.  We look forward to eating in the Sika Restaurant on our next visit.  Finally, we spent a lovely hour in the swimming pool and Jacuzzi the following morning before reluctantly checking out after a brief but most enjoyable stay.  Well done, Powerscourt Hotel!",5,2016,03,13
217,Average and could be better,"Stayed here on business this last week. I'm a Marriott Silver rewards card holder and generally love most Marriott properties. This one however lacked in a few areas, 2 of the lights in the room didn't work and one of the rubbish bins hadn't been emptied properly. Now nothing there is horrendous but at a property like this it shouldn't happen. My biggest disappointment was breakfast, I arrived and was shown to a table and offer tea/coffee and that was it. It was only when I ""used my nose"" did I discover it was a buffet, and only when I had finished what I had chosen to eat did I hear another waitress telling a table nearby about the cooked to order items that were also on offer. To be honest, I felt cheated. I may not have had any but I would at least expect to be told!

In terms of the rooms, they are large, and very comfortable, bathroom is great, so in that aspect it is a good hotel. Checkin was efficient, as was checkout, although perhaps not as friendly.",3,2016,03,12
217,Afternoon tea,Very disappointed with afternoon tea. After staying here on numerous occasions and having spa days here I was really looking forward to coming for afternoon tea. Beautiful setting. Lovely table with view. Nice waitress but food was not impressive for the money you spend. Bread on sandwiches was not fresh like it was made that morning and was sitting out all day. None of us eat fish or cheese so we asked could we swap for something different and our waitress said it wasn't possible so they went to waste. 4 small but warm scones and then we had to ask for the cakes after a wait!! Tiny! For the amount you spend on this it was disappointing. I was in the Royal marine in Dun Laoighre on Saturday for afternoon tea and it was far superior. Would not recommend but beautiful hotel. ,3,2016,03,11
217,Perfect for spoiling ourselves!,"We loved our mini break at Powerscourt hotel. We stayed in a lovely suite with a big balcony and gorgeous view. The spa was amazing, we were totally happy with our massages. We had dinner in the sika restaurant and loved the meal. The service was slightly slow but this wasn't a problem for us at all since we weren't going anywhere. The breakfast buffet in the mornings was great, though again not the fastest service for tea and coffee.
We really enjoyed exploring the gorgeous grounds, the running map came in very handy. I would love to go back again!",5,2016,03,08
217,40 is the number,It would get five stars if it wasnt so expensive in every aspect.€15 for a cosmopolitan .theres also a huge disconnect between the golf club and hotel which are 200yds away.i was celebrating my fortieth which they knew and they tried to charge me forty euros for not turning up to golf when I had rearranged it.very unthoughtful,4,2016,03,08
217,"Nice Room, Disappointing breakfast and Incorrect charges","We stayed here on new years ever for a friends wedding, the bedroom was nice and as expected.  But for a 5 star hotel the breakfast fell well short of what should be served.  In opinion a 5 star hotel should showcase the best of Irish breakfast, but while there were some nice small items the main event, the irish fry was very poor, the worst element being sausages, bacon and pudding tossed together in  silver bowel, also there were no eggs available when we were having breakfast.  To add insult to injury we found that there was an incorrect charge of €80 on our room. Just not good enough, I have stayed in many 5 star hotels and this did not meet expectations",3,2016,03,08
217,I've finally found a 5 star!,"We stayed here for 2 nites this weekend. Beautiful lobby, very helpful reception staff, professional porters who took our luggage to the room for us and provided us with info etc. very nice room, a suite with a 'resort view' the only negative is that the view faced a wall and there was no nespresso machine and there was no turndown service at nite.

All the staff were very pleasant. I found the staff in the lounge very slow, had to wait 20mins for a cocktail. The pool area was lovely but there were kids playing ball in the pool, I think there should be adult only times in the pool.

Breakfast was excellent and again the staff on both mornings were amazing, very professional and friendly. We ate there on one of the nites, very very nice risotto and the hake was cooked very well.

McGills bar was very good for drinks and a very good atmosphere.

We also got a courtesy car to the village and they picked us up, that was the icing on the cake! Another very nice touch was a fruit basket and card with birthday wishes, very impressed!

Would i recommend it? Yes!
Would I return? Yes!",5,2016,03,07
217,"Hotel itself is top class but the food is disappointing , afternoon tea has to be booked a day in advance !","We booked for two nights bed and breakfast for March 2nd and 3rd 2016 and were really looking forward to the experience as the name Powerscourt signifies luxury for most irish people. We were given an upgrade on arrival to a junior suite The hotel is set in the most beautiful part of Ireland with parkland walks right from the front door . The rooms are nothing short of fabulous and the staff are helpful and very nice individually and a credit to the hotel . The food however lets the hotel down and the breakfast on both mornings was the worst I have ever experienced in a five star hotel , avoid the full irish breakfast as the bacon was as stiff as a board , the sausages poor quality , the  fried potatoes  and the black and white pudding limp and a disgrace . We ate in the Pub the first night and to get there you walk through luxurious rooms with double height windows into a subterranean like room , poorly lit with no outside windows , cheap tables and chairs and if they were hoping for your average dingy irish pub 1950’s style well they were successful and the food was fast food standard and disappointing . After breakfast the second day we sat in the lounge at 10 am and tried to book a table for afternoon tea that afternoon to be told this could not be booked on the day as the outside caterer only came to the hotel with a strict food quota based on an order 24 hours earlier … imagine a five star hotel and you can’t order afternoon tea on the day ?!!
A very disappointing visit and it seems to me there is no overall management in place to check that the guests are being looked after .",4,2016,03,06
217,Beutiful,"The hotel was gorgeous! We didn't have much time to enjoy it it was on the last day of our vacation and arrived late and had to catch an early flight. The room was so nice, huge marble bathroom with TV in mirror, huge cozy bed.",5,2016,03,06
217,...and relax. When can we go back?,Our third visit and we cannot wait for our fourth! Brilliant spa experience with an excellent therapist Gin who provided two hours of bliss. Serenity room and the thermal suite are just amazing and I was lucky enough to have both to myself on two days. A wonderful setting and if there was just a little choice for vegetarians it would be perfect! Thank you.,5,2016,03,05
217,Amazing venue!,"A simply beautiful hotel in an amazing part of Ireland. From the first minute the staff were incredibly friendly and helpful, we were upgraded so that''s always a great start! The Suites are the kind of place you just don't want to leave. 

The jacuzzi, pool and steam room are top class and so relaxing. The gym is as good as you'd expect it to be. 

We opted for bar food which was faultless with staff checking on us several times over the evening. The bar itself is gorgeous and unlike the generic, dull hotel bars we are all bored with. Live music added to the evening! 

Highly recommended. ",5,2016,03,04
217,Your Team are a credit to you ,"Most amazing hotel stay i have ever had!! Each member of staff was polite and respectful! A special mention goes out to Elena in Sika for being more then accommodating, curtious and is a genuine credit to your company. George who served our dinner who was full of conversation is a delight & micheala from ESPA who is so sweet and is truly passionate about her work another hard working member of your team. The room was beyond out expectation and i could honestly live in that bathroom without regret its so beautifully done!! Breakfast was a relaxed service which is unusual to see in a 5star especially on a Sunday morning.

Cant wait to come back whenever that may be !!

217,Fantastic hotel,"We had a fantastic short break in Powerscourt recently. Beautiful suite, stunning surroundings, excellent service, wonderful food and top class spa. A very relaxing stay overall. We would both highly recommend this hotel and will definitely return. ",5,2016,02,29
217,Never fails to impress.,We have been going to this hotel for a number of years for weekends. It never disappoints. From the greeting at the door on arrival to the fond farewell when  leaving the staff are more than pleasant. It has to be our favourite hotel and we are well travelled. If you happen across a wrinkle it is promptly dealt with . Over the years we have tried all the restaurants including McGills and room service and haven't yet been disappointed. The Spa is also worth a visit. WE  COULDNT RECCOMMEND THIS PROPERTY ENOUGH.,5,2016,02,28
217,Stunning. ,"What an amazing hotel.  I wish we had found it sooner.  I've found a gem.  We stayed here for two nights.  We had a suite and a twin room inter connecting. Really large rooms with a huge amount of wardrobe space, as in a separate room! The view was stunning over the garden at night it's beautifully light up.  
We ate in the lobby restaurant and had a lovely meal and cocktails. My only complaint is there was only one vegetarian option which I didn't like but had to order. I actually didn't eat it. I asked if chef could do something else and was told I could have vegetables. Given there are so many options on the room service menu I'd of thought it wouldn't have hurt to say I could have chosen one of these.  
The staff are very helpful.  I also had a massage in the spa.  Amazing. I loved it.  

We already plan to return with our eldest children in the summer. There's so much to explore.  A truly beautiful hotel.   ",5,2016,02,26
217,Top class hotel in a stunning setting,"Stayed here with my mother overnight to indulge in a half day spa treat. We were upgraded to a junior suite. It was massive, walk in wardrobes, separate toilet, shower and bath with a TV in the mirror. Living area and separate bedroom with two decent sized, extremely comfy beds. Also, massive terrace with garden furniture overlooking the grounds. The half day spa package was brilliant and so relaxing with a tasty 3 course lunch provided. Would definitely recommend.",5,2016,02,24
217,Absolutely outstanding and amazing truly 5star Spa,"I chose ESPA Powerscourt to celebrate my 40's with my girls last Sunday and we had absolutely fabulous day - started from the moment we got into reception, we enjoyed all the Heat Experience, the tranquility of Serenity Room and one of the most amazing massage I have ever had. My therapist Robyn was absolutely brilliant, with her amazing skills she made me feel so relaxed that all my tension was gone. It was a great decision to be back to ESPA Powerscourt and it definitely wasn't my last visit.",5,2016,02,23
217,Amazing Room,"The rooms here are something else. A huge kitchen with its own butler entrance, a sitting room, a study, the bedroom, the bathroom and two separate toilets.  

Pros: The view and service and pure luxury of the room and the pancakes at breakfast.

Cons: are the bed wasn't very comfortable compared to other 5 star hotels.",5,2016,02,23
217,OMG,"Amazing, stunning, sheer luxury, really is 5* quality through and through, amazing treat for a special occasion or just a hideaway from the rest of the outside world - whether you are into golfing, running strolling everything is catered for",5,2016,02,23
217,A must!,"We had a really nice experience and stay in a suite here in Powerscourt
The Staff are not over bearing and are working away in the background - they are nearly like mind readers! Very well tuned it and much appreciated! Great atmosphere down in the Irish bar!!! Great big hearty Portions! 
The gym had great equipment and the lovely attendant appeared with a fresh bottle of water just as I realized I had none! The sauna and pool area is lovely, clean and very calming! I would return to this hotel tomorrow! 
Great comfortable beds too and the suites are really spacious! 
Pint cost €6.10 in the hotel 
Nachos (starter) large portion in Irish Pub - €14
Chicken Wings - €10 
Just to give a sense of costs at the hotel 
Great lighting in the bathroom - the TV and Hairdryer in the bathroom where broken though during our stay :(",5,2016,02,22
217,Excessive Dust on Headboard for the second time,"A special birthday treat for my wife was spoiled by excessive dust on the headboard for the second time, even though I had emailed ahead stating that I had this problem last year and that it was not acceptable. Yes it did get cleaned, er received a free drink and received a generous discount but it should not have happened and it spoiled our overnight stay. As someone who suffers from allergies this is a health risk and I would consider this unacceptable in any hotel, but especially this hotel which excels in so many other areas. I was told by the duty manager that they did not have sufficient staff to clean the headboards, the head of cleaning told me they did not have correct product, I do not accept any of these excuses and if I had my way I could close all the rooms until this issue was sorted, it's unacceptable to ask anyone to sleep under these conditions. I took before and after pictures which I will be sending to the manager.",4,2016,02,22
217,A weekend of pure indulgence,"From the minute we checked in we had nothing but a wonderful experience.  We were fours friends on a girls weekend and the hotel and spa delivered on everything we needed.  We were pleasantly surprised by getting upgrades to suites.  The rooms were spacious and well appointed and the beds super comfortable.
We had dinner in McGills on Friday evening which was bustling and had a good atmosphere.  The food was good pub grub and the portions were generous.
The buffet breakfast has an excellent selection to choose from.  
The highlight of the trip was the Spa experience on Saturday.  The treatments we received were excellent with the staff being experienced and extremely professional.
We had dinner in the Sika restaurant on Saturday night and cannot fault the food, the only thing that probably stopped us from enjoying that 100% was that we could only get a table for 9.30 so eating such a large meal so late is not very comfortable (but this is not the hotels fault as such).
All the staff we met were friendly and courteous.  I would love to go back and spend another weekend here.",5,2016,02,22
217,FANTASTIC! HIGHLY RECOMMENDED!,"Dawn was really helpful with our booking. When we arrived for our stay, Ruth on reception was brilliant. Stephen helped us with our bags and was really helpful giving us a history of the Hotel and showing us the working of all the controls in the room (the TV in the bathroom mirror is awesome and as for the 'moving curtains'..!) The view of the Sugar Loaf was spectacular. The Mountain View Suite we had was wonderful-so much closet space for our few bits!  AND two bathrooms!!
Housekeeping was the best ever we have experienced. We stayed in the room on our 2nd day, as the weather was very wet. The poor ladies left notes outside our room, having attempted to clean the room three times! They even phoned us and we were able to prove we were alive and well! How lovely of them!
 
The Sika restaurant is highly recommended-wonderful food created by Chef Peter Byrne and a lovely personal touch, presenting us with a birthday cake. On the second evening, we had chowder in the Sugar Loaf Lounge and Chef Jesus has to be commended- it was the best we've ever tasted-not too creamy and plenty of fish. Melinda served us and was a really friendly lady.
Breakfast in the Sika had many choices. The muffins were absolutely gorgeous-particularly the blueberry ones!
The eSpa just has to be experienced to appreciate it. Try the scrub/oil massage- leaves you feeling wonderful!
 It's great to find such a fabulous place in Ireland- THANK YOU to everyone who made our special occasion even more special! We returned home feeling refreshed and relaxed, all thanks to this wonderful experience.",5,2016,02,20
217,Perfect weekend away ,"Amazing food and service in Sika Restaraunt. Pub was great on the Friday night afterwards. Gorgeous rooms and bathrooms for relaxation as well as the swimming pool and spa. We really enjoyed our stay and will certainly return despite the price, worth every penny.

",5,2016,02,19
217,First tour of Ireland,Just wanted to say this is a rare jewel.  Best Hotel/SPA I have ever stayed at.  A special thank you to Kasia our waitress in the Sugar Loaf Lounge.  The only one in the Bar area that could make my wife a decent Margarita.  Made our trip so enjoyable as my wife loves great Margaritas.  Loved everyone as they are so friendly and attentive.  ,5,2016,02,19
217,Beautiful place - just below perfect,"So, I have been eyeing up this place for a long time now, the photos just draw you in when you see it.  Anyway, when you get there, its a lovely setting, nice long drive overlooking the valley and out to the sugarloaf mountain.  I think the real thing in my opinion that takes a few points off this place is the reception and the internal atmosphere.  A lot of the staff and particularly at reception were just too corporate and cold rather than welcoming and friendly.  The friendly greeting was there, but not very genuine.  On top of that, we were given the wrong room number at first and when the key didnt work, I went back down to reception and they issued new keys but the problem was the room they put us in already had people there!  On going back down (this all with a new baby in two) they realised that my booking was for a nicer room and finally gave us the right key and right room.  In fairness to hotel management they did deliver a nice plate of chocolate treats to our room after as an apology.
So, we were staying there for 2 nights and it wasnt the best of starts but let me paint the god stuff now. The room set-up for the suites at least was amazing.  Technology everywhere for closing the curtains, aircon, TV in the mirror in the bathroom all married with plush beds, large batch and shower and lovely furntiure.  I cant praise the room enough.  Definitely a 5 out of 5 if going on room only.  The food there was great, catered for the baby too with the best baby bowl that we have got anywhere.  And there were staff in the restaurant and at breakfast who didnt have the corporate air, just were friendly.  Room service were great also (despite our many requests for warmed milk for the baby), relly friendly room service staff.   The only leisure facilities we saw was the pool, which we and the baby loved.  There are certain times you can go with children so it may not suit all families who are looking here but we found it suited our times perfectly.  The area around the hotel is lovely, enniskerry is nice to pop down to for a meal and easy accessibility to Dublin/Wicklow mountains or Dundrum for the shoppers (it was Christmas).  It is pricey up here but worth it as a treat - just think I prefer other places in terms of atmosphere alone.  Come the end of our 2 days we were completely happy with the trip so I cant fault it and I probably will be back.  I would just ask that the atmosphere is a little less corporate the next time",4,2016,02,17
217,"Nice Hotel, Air Con in room problems.","I booked a 2 night stay in this hotel in a one bedroom suite. On arrival we were shown around the room by the poter staff and shown the touch pad for operating lights, air con etc. The main problem with the room was the Air Con which was not working in the bedroom and was blasting hot air in the living room and we had no control over this. I rang 2 times before we got a portable heater to heat the cold bedroom, while we could not sit in the sitting room as the temp was uncomfortable to sit in. On the second day the sitting room Air Con was still blasting hot air with no control and again we reported this and was told an engineer would come and look at it, after another 2 calls the engineer arrived and said he would go to the master panel and control the Air Con, after an hour the Air Con in the sitting room reduced to a normal temp and the bedroom was slightly better. Before checkout on the Sunday the living room Air Con was again blasting out hot air, at checkout we were asked about our stay and we explained about the Air Con problems over the weekend and we were asked did we want to speak to the manager but then were told the manager was on lunch, we were asked to leave a phone no and the manager would ring us, I am still waiting for the call....??? After spending a lot of money on this stay, I have been very annoyed by the Air Con issues and the non response from the hotel.",4,2016,02,16
217,Pricey but a nice treat,"Stayed here for a weekend in a lovely 6th floor suite facing the mountains. Expensive but worth is for a special occasion. Great staff, beautiful rooms. Prices across the board - 6.10 for a pint of Heineken in the bar?! Sika restaurant food was top class and quite good value for money. Would stay again for another big occasion. Needs a little maintenance - some of the paving slabs around the hotel and on my balcony were loose. ",4,2016,02,14
217,superb service,"We stayed for one night in Powerscourt and it was superb.  We were celebrating a birthday and the service from the moment we booked to the moment we left was excellent. Our room had a lovely view of the mountains and was luxurious.  The food in the Sika restaurant was very good with a nice selection of game, steak and fish.  Breakfast also had a wonderful variety of foods and the service was excellent here too.  We cycled the Riverside Walk on bikes provided by the hotel.   Will definitely visit again. A special mention to Daniel, Danielle and Andrew who ensured a memorable grown up family stay for us.",5,2016,02,12
217,Stunning Hotel,"This was our third visit in a year to this gorgeous Hotel. we celebrated my husbands special Birthday here booking two rooms over two nights for our family of five. This hotel is luxurious with gorgeous rooms and a spectacular spa. The staff on every occasion were friendly and helpful ensuring everything is just right for your stay. My only complaint is that we are never upgraded to a room with mountain view. Each time we stayed including our special occasion we have overlooked the car park. It would have been nice to have an upgrade that weekend in March when we had booked two rooms and dining in Sika restaurant. There was no complimentary drink or service that you would expect  from a 5 Star hotel when celebrating an occasion. Our last stay in January 2016,we asked to switch to a room with a view and we were told there was none available. Turns out the Hotel was only at half occupancy and we were disappointed that our request could not be granted despite being Marriot gold members. Having said all that our stay was fabulous, we definitely will return and would highly recommend this hotel to family and friends.  Visit the gorgeous Powerscout gardens and Enniskerry village is also very quaint. ",5,2016,02,11
217,Excellent spa,We stayed one night in the Powerscourt and it was amazing. The decor of the hotel is beautiful. We ate in McGills bar and the food was lovely..big portion sizes. The spa is definitely the best I have seen. Loved all the facilities. I got a massage off a therapist called Una. She did an amazing job. Very relaxing. Kata on Spa reception was very helpful and friendly. I will definitely be staying again.!,5,2016,02,09
217,Amazing Hotel - great location!,"Powerscourt is a great hotel. 

All round, a very enjoyable stay! Would definitely visit again.

The entrance lobby is impressive and the bedrooms are well equipped. The staff provide great service; the concierge provided some great recommendations for things to visit - thanks!

The grounds and countryside surrounding the hotel are scenic and there are plenty of 
beautiful things to visit in the surrounding area (riverside walk, Powerscourt waterfall, Glendalough - really recommend the latter). Enniskerry village is close to the hotel and there's a courtesy car if you want to go there (though it's also not far to walk). Recommend Macs Bar if you're looking for somewhere good to have a drink.

The breakfast buffet was great and had a broad selection. We ate at McGills pub in the hotel and, while slightly pricier than your typical pub, the food was good. The chicken wings were super!

The only minor downside was that it was not possible to book into the main restaurant during our stay as it was fully booked.",5,2016,02,07
217,Most impressed,"From the minute I walked through the doors of this beautiful hotel the staff couldn't have been nicer.  They really did everything to please and make our stay so pleasant. A big thank you to Jens, Andrew and Aidan you are a credit to this hotel. I will be back to enjoy another stay.",5,2016,02,05
217,amazing property!,You cannot go wrong with a stay here! beautiful hotel! amazing vistas! great breakfast! Wish I had planned more time there to be able to use the spa. Near the train station to get to dublin as well which was convenient.,5,2016,02,04
217,Relaxing and luxurious stay,From arrival to departure nothing was too much trouble.  Staff were all friendly and welcoming. The food in the restaurant was excellent with a good choice on menu and all perfectly presented. We stayed in a one bedroom suite which was well worth the extra money it was a home from home. I would definitely recommend a visit to this hotel.,5,2016,02,04
217,Lovely Friday night,"Visited Powerscourt at the end of January, i took my friend for her birthday.

Room was lovely and big but was on the chilly side. Dinner down in the Sugar Loaf lounge was lovely and relaxed. Brekkie the next morning was great. Large choice and the actual restaurant was lovely. 

Only downside is the removal of the 'Dog Friendly' policy. This is what made us visit previously.",4,2016,02,03
217,BEAUTIFUL!,"We were booked in this hotel as part of a package deal, and really didn't know what to expect because the deal was phenomenal. We drove from the Dublin airport and when we pulled up, we almost couldn't believe how beautiful it was. Then it just got better, because our room was HUGE and the bathroom was gorgeous and HUGE and our view was breathtaking. Even the shampoo and conditioner was great. It was clean, it was opulent and I would love to stay there again.
The Powerscourt Gardens, just a walk down the street is even better.",5,2016,02,02
217,Nice weekend,"its a beautiful Hotel the reception areas and the bedrooms are lovely, we had a suite it was very big & a little on the cold side, we asked for the heating to be looked at (didn't happen so we asked for an extra heater, reception said they'd send it...didn't happen) the buffet breakfast was very good,the restaurant is very nice but expensive the bar is in the basement its cosy and the bar food is very good, its a very big busy hotel so customer service is on that scale, if your looking for a relaxing SPA break maybe its not ideal as kids are allowed into the pool spa area (its a little noisy) the grounds are spectacular.",4,2016,02,01
217,Great location and spacious rooms,"Arrived at the hotel and have to say from the exterior it really is the most bizarre building I have seen for some time. The hotel is partially underground and you arrive in at the Lobby which is actually the 4th floor. However, as soon a you enter the hotel delights await. Friendly staff, opulent decor and huge rooms - we were lucky enough to get an upgrade which was amazing, but all the rooms seem to be vast with hallways, high ceilings and spacious bathrooms. I had the best sleep I have had in a long time and although there are a lot of gimmicks in the rooms (in built plasma screens in the mirrors, electric closing curtains and touch screen lighting) this all adds to the sense of getting away from it all.
The food is good too. Breakfast was perfect, eggs Benedict can be ordered and you really don't feel as if you are putting the chef out. We had dinner a la carte also and again excellent. The service was spotless and the food beautifully prepared and presented.
The village is a short walk away and busy with two bars and coffee shops - you can get a lift from the hotel if needed. Powerscourt was a delight also and has an Avoca shop and cafe  in the house.
All in all a great retreat away, but the external look of the building is starting to look dated and bits of it could do with a power wash or revamp, but I really am being picky...I would return in a heartbeat...",4,2016,01,30
217,Lovely staff,"Stayed for two nights sat/sun Jan 2016.  Very nice decor etc. room was a lovely size, bathroom also.  Wifi good. Food very good, have had food as nice as this in less expensive hotels.  On Sunday wanted to have lunch in sugar loaf lounge but there were no tables available, maybe guests should be told it is necessary to book?  We ate in the lobby , it was fine.  Had a housekeeping issue which took a while to sort.  At these prices I would have expected a more prompt reaction. Overall good hotel.  Great location.  ",4,2016,01,30
217,A great escape!!,"Went for a night away from everything. Only 45 mins rom our house in Dublin. We went for package deal, superior room, 2 treatments, evening meal in the Sika restaurant and b&b. The room was excellent, very modern with remote control lights and curtains from bedside lockers. Sika restaurant was a wonderful dining experience. Great food and wine. Excellent service. Only thing was the glass windows in the restaurant which looked out at the lifts. Very distracting. We both had massages and it was the ultimate in relaxation especially the tranquility room.",5,2016,01,29
217,Short break for babymoon,"After our house renovations being delayed again, we decided to head to the powerscourt hotel for one night. It's a lovely hotel with a fantastic pool. However, we felt that service in some areas let the overall standard down ( in the sugarloaf lounge and the bar particularly).

Pros: hotel room standard are fantastic including the toiletries and the pool was lovely

Cons: service was slow and very inattentive, kids were in the bar after 9 on a Saturday, room services charges were pricey even by 5 star standards ( hot chocolate : 6 euro plus tray charge of 5).

We will however stay again due to convenience to Dublin and the overall feeling of getting away from reality. ",4,2016,01,27
217,Brilliant experience,"We are just back from an excellent couple of days' stay at Powerscourt and agree with all the positive comments here. This is an exceptional hotel in every way. It's a little difficult to locate, though the hotel's driving instructions are spot on if you take the trouble to follow them. If you're using car satnav, set it for Enniskerry and then follow the signs or instructions from there. 
The hotel is set in rolling parkland, with impressive scenery all round it. The building is really impressive, and the good service starts when you arrive at the front door, where the friendly staff take your luggage. There is loads of car parking space nearby, including some under cover. Checking was quick & painless and our room was nearby, on the same floor. It was huge, with a separate dressing area & plenty of wardrobe space. The bathroom was vast too, with separate bath & rainfall shower, twin sinks & extension TV screen in the mirror. The bedroom had views on to Sugarloaf mountain, and the room was equipped with various touch pads to operate the lights, ""do not disturb"" signs etc., including some beside the vast & comfortable bed. There were tea & coffee making facilities and a well stocked minibar.
We dined in the main (Sika) fine-dining restaurant on the first evening, and the food & service was exceptional. There is a good wine list with a wide range of prices. There is a less formal dining area just off the main foyer, though we didn't use it and can't comment on it, and also an Irish pub-style bar downstairs, which serves food though we just had a quick pint in it.
Breakfast was really good, and we didn't experience any of the problems that we've had in other hotels, which usually stem from inexperienced staff. Here, the staff were super efficient, even offering us coffee & pastries to go! (Sadly, after a full Irish breakfast, we had to pass that offer up).
The hotel provides courtesy cars, and heavy looking bikes for residents' use. Given the steepness of the hills round this part of the world, I would be inclined to use some other form of transport!
All in all, we greatly enjoyed our short stay, despite the wintry weather. We couldn't sample the spa facilities in the time available, but maybe next time. For now, thanks to all the superbly trained staff who made our stay so special.",5,2016,01,27
217,Away from it all....,"This hotel is one which we have stayed in a few times & it is truely an experience. So much so my wife & I got engaged there in the days it was the Ritz Carlton. 
We stayed in one of the mountain view suites which has a lovely living space, bedroom with wonderful superkingsize beds. It had lovely walk in shower, seperate latge bath & even a tv in the mirrors so you can watch your favourite tv show when you are shaving...gadget I know but really cool. The room even has a little touchscreen beside the bed that operates everything from the lights to the curtains. 

Facilities such as the hotel pool was great & had a very relaxing atmosphere, you could spend hours there. 

Needless to say plenty of good things here including 
(1) Excellent room facilities & awesome bathrooms. 
(2) Very attentive helpful staff.
(3) Extremely quite rooms & everything spotlessly clean. 
(4) Lovely pool/spa facilities. 

On the negative side despite it being a very expensive hotel (but like anything you get what you pay for) there is really nothing of note

It is a beautiful resort to stay in and it does have a real feeling of being away from it all which is really what these places strive towards.

217,Spa visit,I had an Absolutely brilliant time in the powerscourt spa! Katie on reception was really fantastic and my therapist flora really knows her stuff! Brilliant day out! Cannot wait to plan my next trip! Thanks!!,5,2016,01,25
217,Beauty at it's best,"Stayed here for a night recently for a little relaxation,and have to say we really enjoyed this exclusive hotel . Service at the reception was quick and professional.Cases were taken to our room and we were given a quick introduction to the various bars and restaurants. Room was clean and tidy with plenty of space .It was also elegant and charming.Great views were had from both restaurant . Down stairs bar also served food . Choice on all menus was good . Breakfast was excellent and very good selection.Took time the following morning to walk around the gardens and view the hotel from a different angle.It was stunning.Must say also that the staff were very friendly.",5,2016,01,25
217,Highly recommend this hotel,"We spent a most amazing night in this hotel for my husband's birthday, there were nine of us altogether. Fabulous spacious rooms with beautiful views of the Sugar Loaf mountain and the beautiful Wicklow countryside. We definitely  will be back and loved it all. Dinner was excellent and the diningroom staff could'nt do enough for us. I would highly recommend this hotel but would have two small reservations - one, that we arrived at 3.45pm and our rooms were not ready for occupation and we had to change for our spa treatments (Spa excellent too!) without getting into our rooms. So definitely the rooms should be ready earlier than this. Also I do have to say that the breakfast was not to the standard I expected from a 5* hotel and we were disappointed with this. But for these two comments I would definitely rate this hotel as ""excellent"" so don't let this put you off though as we really enjoyed our stay! ",4,2016,01,25
217,Superb hotel,"Went there for a night and it was most enjoyable from the moment we arrived until we checked out. Superb spa, magnificent place and great restaurant. Rooms are beautiful and impeccable decorated. Staff is polite and courteous. A five star service indeed!",5,2016,01,24
217,Fantastic Experience ,Our family booked four rooms for my husbands special birthday. It was a surprise for him as he thought we were going alone. The staff checked the rest of the family in before we arrived and upgraded every room. He had a brilliant surprise complete with cake and I cannot thank the staff enough for their service food and beautiful rooms. We can't wait to return. ,5,2016,01,24
217,"Really, really poor 5 star experience","We stayed here for a couple of nights between Christmas and New Year 2015. The bedrooms are fabulous - really beautifully appointed, and big. That was the highlight.  The hotel seemed to have a lot more residents that it could cater for in terms of food or general service. We had one dinner booked as part of our package but when we arrived to check-in at the start of our stay the restaurant was fully booked util 9.30pm for each night of our stay. The other dining option is the Sugar Loaf Lounge (which is a seating area just off reception/foyer - and looked nice) was also full the first night...So your options then are (a) bus into the village to a restaurant there or (b) the irish bar downstairs which was absolute mayhem -- neither of these are the reason why I chose to stay in a five star hotel!  We booked a table for the Sugar Loaf Lounge for the next evening - got given a dreadful table (it was akin to a Milano Pizza Express experience --- which is fine if that is what you've signed up for!!) and half the tables were empty. We did get moved when we asked - with a bit of a to-do about it. Tables around us in the main part of this lounge area remained free for the whole duration of our meal and afterwards!  You also have to wait /queue to get into this area, even with a reservation and the you are standing in a corridor leading to bedrooms while you wait - so you're always in the way.    There is no real seating area around the hotel. There are three sets of couches in the foyer but there are no other rooms/areas where you could relax with a book or the likes.  The staff are fairly curt in the main apart from a couple of the staff in the dining areas.  So overall it was a really disappointing stay and was way too expensive for what it delivers.  We stayed in Mount Falcon in Mayo a few weeks later for a third of the price an it was a much more pleasant experience overall!  Powerscourt House and gardens which are just down the road for the Powerscourt Hotel are great.  But I wouldn't stay in Powerscourt Hotel again and I wouldn't recommend it.",2,2016,01,22
217,First Class Staff,"I stayed at this hotel for a weekend for a  leisure break.  The hotel itself is modern, very clean and pays close attention to detail which ensures the guest's every need is catered for.
The staff were the outstsanding aspect of my stay.  Every single person I came into contact with was friendly, helpful and considerate.  There are two staff members 'on the door'.  These men went out of their way to be helpful and took time to explain a good running route, give directions on how to get to local amenities or have a friendly chat.
The staff at the busy breakfast area were equally friendly and although busy took time to smile and treat everyone with friendly courtesy.
Well done to all",5,2016,01,22
217,Pretty Flawless,"I attended a work event here back in October and afterwards we had dinner with our partners and an overnight stay. Everything was pretty flawless throughout; I almost never give 5 star reviews but it's essentially impossible not to. The meeting facilities were probably the best that I've come across (and I've used most of the top hotels in and around Dublin). The public areas of the hotel are built in a very grand style and are kept in pristine fashion. Our dinner was excellent, with classic dishes using highest quality ingredients, all executed perfectly. And the suites were both spacious and luxurious (although our bedside control panel seemed to be out of order). We had breakfast delivered the following morning which was also superb, and we spent a few hours after checkout touring the gardens of the nearby Powerscourt Estate. Everyone that we dealt with was unfailingly polite and professional. We have a voucher to use for another night so we're counting down the days now until we can get a babysitter and return.",5,2016,01,20
217,"Great hotel, very bad at reservations","I stayed here Saturday night. Booked over the phone as the option to book an evening meal was not available on their website. It took 15 minutes to make the booking, (major language barrier) 
When we arrived Saturday we were told there was no reservation for us and that we were booked in for the 16th of February rather than January! 
So even after the torture of explaining myself over and over on the phone weeks previous for 15 minutes, our booking still managed to be wrong. 
Luckily the hotel was not booked out that so we were upgraded for then inconvenience. 
After all that, I really enjoyed our stay, Sika restaurant is fine dining at its best. 
Breakfast was amazing as well, after a 10 min queue... 

Also, be ready spend you're money! 
12.50 to use the Internet on the tv in you're room. 3.50 for a pack of crisps.

217,Simply stunning,"My wife and I stayed in the hotel for 4 days as part of our ""mini-moon"". Absolutely fantastic trip. The room, which overlooked the mountain, was spacious and extravagant. The food in the hotel was absolutely excellent, breakfast, lunch & dinner. 
The staff were very helpful and able to advise on many local attractions.",5,2016,01,18
217,Excellent hotel and estate ,"This hotel is amazing - perfect blend of mountain, nature, history and relaxing. Everyone can find something for him/her like SPA, Irish pub, river walk, horse riding, golf, astonishing gardens, historical castle and museum, Celtic outdoor games and more, and more. I LOVE this place!!!",5,2016,01,17
217,"If you want to be overwhelmed, this is the place","We stayed for one night on our last night in Ireland. After seeing the grounds and the room and the lobby, my family decided that I screwed up by not making the whole stay here. The rooms were expansive and beautifully adorned. All of our needs were more than fulfilled. The major restaurant is pretty expensive, but they also have a Irish pub on site that serves great food at a more reasonable rate.",5,2016,01,17
217,"Perfect for a romantic weekend, spa trip, posh hiker trip etc...","I'm on a solo spa trip, but love it here and -- plan to return this summer with my husband. I'm not a hiker ( I hike in Gucci loafers) but the grounds are stunning. It's on an estate, in a national park. My corner suite - room 649 - looks onto rolling hills. They have bikes to loan, with picnic basket. I was a little worried about being isolated but this hotel has EVERYTHING (golf, shooting, spa, horseback riding) and, there is a cute little village a short walk away with galleries and shops. 
Spa: the spa was able to accommodate my last minute booking. It looks amazing. 
Just go !!!",5,2016,01,17
217,Noeleen Mccabe ,"Our visit to this hotel was a lovely Christmas gift,we had a lovely time 
The staff were very friendly and welcoming,the food and service was top class, our room was so comfortable,best nights sleep for a long time,well done to the management and all the staff,it easy to see why this is a top class hotel ",5,2016,01,17
217,Amazing hotel in fantastic location and free WIFI,"If you want to spoil yourself, book this hotel. One of the nicest, well looked after hotels I've been to. From a speedy, friendly check in, to the beautiful and very spacious rooms, huge bathroom with separate toilet and shower and amenities, well stocked Minibar and a walk in wardrobe! You arrive into a great entrance hall and feel instantly welcome and relaxed. This hotel has an amazing Pool and SPA - you just can't go wrong here. Very child friendly as well! The SIKA restaurant offers you a great dinner experience with the nicest food! The Staff is so friendly and attentive, it was truly a fantastic evening! There is a Bar as well, which serves not only nice cold drinks and cocktails but a a good range of very tasty ""Pubfood"".
The grounds are fantastic and great for walks. they have bikes to rent to explore the huge area this hotel is located in.
Great stay in a beautiful hotel with courteous and lovely staff. Wifi is free in all areas of the hotel!
The breakfast buffet was absolutely amazing and nothing was impossible in terms of extras! Thank you to the wonderful staff who made our stay unforgettable!",5,2016,01,17
217,Can't wait to go back,"The front of the hotel is less than remarkable, ugly even, but it belies the warmth and beauty inside the doors. The staff are courteous. We enjoyed our suite which was big by most standards. We had a lovely dressing room, the bathroom is clad in white marble, the lounge was generous and well appointed and the bedroom nicely styled and had a comfortable king size bed. The afternoon tea service was a lovely touch which we enjoyed after a leisurely visit to Powerscourt Estate, a five minute walk from the hotel. We enjoyed the onsite pub which feature a good assortment of brews and spirits. We enjoyed a number of local beers and the singing provided by the Google employees who were staying at the hotel. Lots of good fun! The breakfast buffet was lovely with numerous tasty options. The room overlooks the back of the hotel and the mountains beyond. The hotel is approx. 30 minutes from Dublin yet a world away. We did not try the spa nor eat dinner on site, but look forward to doing so the next time we visit which I hope will be soon! There is a golf course just across the street from the hotel which features two options.

This is a wonderful hotel. I highly recommend it.",5,2016,01,14
217,Amazing Hotel,"We visited the hotel for a special birthday, six ladies from 18 to 70+ and everyone loved it! The staff are so kind. We were upgraded free to suites, given lots of time to check out, checked in early. Nothing was an issue. The staff in all parts of the hotel were wonderful. The food was superb. I had spent months planning the birthday surprise for a loved one and I was so thrilled it all went so well. They really take care of you, we ae all going back, I live nearby but will still come back to stay over for a treat again soon! Just book it you won't regret it!",5,2016,01,14
217,Great break in a beautiful hotel,"I went with my wife and two kids (1 and 3 year old boys) for a Sun - Tues stay late November. Hotel was quiet which was good with the kids. The spa / pool facilities are impressive and staff couldn't have been more helpful.
We went to the bar restaurant on the first night - food was good and there was a nice open fire to keep us warm. They were also putting up Christmas decoration which the kids enjoyed. Breakfast was awesome. pancake machine was a hit!
Good location as well. We went to the National Sea Life Centre close by with the kids.
Overall good experience and would definitely go back. Not sure how suited for kids the hotel would be in busy periods.",5,2016,01,11
217,"Shocking experience in a ""so called"" 5 star hotel","We went to Powerscourt for a mini-moon after getting married

Service with in the hotel was not up to 5 star standards, we where left waiting on our dinner table for over 15mins after booking a table for a certain time. 
Damp wet dog in lobby of hotel
Breakfast was a disaster as we where left waiting AGAIN on a table as there was no tables available when we went for breakfast. And it took 15mins to get a pot of tea
Staff not interested in listening to our comments as they where rude and not co-operative.
BEWARE.....when checking in they swipe your credit card but DO NOT tell you what for or for how much. We had a mere of a time trying to sort out why we where getting charged TWICE!!!
Overall food/bar was nice (Over priced tough) service shocking and its certainly not worth 350euro per night
NEVER TO RETURN",1,2016,01,10
217,Amazing,"Stayed Saturday 9th...We were lucky enough to have a suite which was fantastic. Bed was so comfortable. Room was beautiful and so spacious.We eat in the restaurant which was ""out of this world"". Food was amazing and so were all staff .
We were sad to leave but definitely will be returning soon.
Other hotels in Dublin should pay a visit here to see how to run a brilliant business and have spectacular friendly helpful staff. ",5,2016,01,10
217,Truly exceptional!,"This was our 2nd visit to this wonderful hotel. We stayed over new year and had a wonderful time. Although we arrived early we spent a relaxing time in the bar area to wait and was given a complimentary tea, the room was ready earlier than expected which was appreciated as we had had an early flight, the extremely comfy bed was well worth the wait.

Both meals in the Sika restaurant were exceptional, Joel was very helpful and a credit to the restaurant. The food was superb, very tasty, our compliments to the chefs, the almond ice cream was particularly good.
We had a spa treatment which was wonderful, in fact the whole time we spent in the pool area was exceptional, kept clean and tidy and was very peaceful. 
We had a meal in Mcgills, which was very good and filling, again the staff were very friendly and helpful.
Our room was lovely, with a small balcony, although the weather was rather inclement it was nice to admire the wonderful views of the Sugar Loaf mountains.
We enjoyed a room service meal, which was very good and plentiful, and again the staff very friendly.

We had thought that there may have been a bit of a special evening arranged for New Year's Eve. At the time of booking we were advised it was a Gala meal, which implied a bit of a party, in the end it turned out to be a meal in the Sika restaurant.  We spent seeing in the new year in the sugar loaf lounge, which was extremely busy with meals being served practically till midnight, the waiters never seemed to stop.
We still had a good night, with a singer/pianist playing. The fact that there had been a wedding booked for New Year's Eve perhaps had an reason behind there being no party.

Although the hotel was full the only time you felt it was at breakfast, which with all hotels if you go down after 10.00 am on a holiday weekend there can be a bit of a wait, although we were offered a table upstairs in the lounge which was just as good. On the mornings we managed to drag ourselves out of our lovely bed early, there was no issue with being seated and the choice is amazing with the waiters on hand bringing fresh tea or coffee when asked.

We thoroughly enjoyed our stay and thank all the staff, front of house and behind the scenes for a lovely time. We will defiantly be returning this year.

217,Lush Getaway ,"What a fantastic retreat tucked away in the heart of the Wicklow mountains. 

Check in is usually 3pm but be prepared to sit in the bar for up to 2 hours before getting a room, which will delay your whole experience of the amenities this fabulous hotel. 

Bring your own alcohol for the room as the price of drinks is worse than Temple Bar!!  
",4,2016,01,08
217,Great way to start the year,Stayed here with friends on New Years Day and had a really wonderful time. This is a beautiful hotel in a great location and with stunning views. Food and service was great and I particularly enjoyed the service from Ian in the bar and his espresso martini was second to none. Can't wait to go back!,5,2016,01,08
217,A lovely relaxing stay,We stayed here for a quiet night away and had a really lovely relaxing experience. The hotel is beautiful and the rooms are very comfortable and well appointed. Dinner in the restaurant was faultless and we got great service throughout. We also enjoyed the gym facilities and compared to similar hotels the gym was really large and well equipped. Highly recommended!,5,2016,01,08
217,The way one should do Christmas Day dinner !,"After entertaining family on Christmas Eve and again on Christmas morning I was so looking foreword to returning to powerscourt for my dinner and was I do glad when I arrived ,
The festive feeling from the time you enter the grounds .
Beautiful lighting up he avenue and the lobby was very tastefully decorated. 
We dined in the ballroom which was not too packed when we got there very relaxing I must say.
The staff were very welcoming and helpful.
The food was delicious cold buffet starters as much as you can eat of everything , that is the problem , eyes too big for tummy , but we managed to get through it all , right down to the delicious deserts. 
Thanks to all , 
I will gladly return 
Happy new year to all at powerscourt may it be prosperous

217,A definite five star experience! ,"
My partner and I stayed in Powerscourt Hotel for a pre-Christmas break with our two children and it couldn't have been better. The staff were very professional and attentive, and couldn't have been more helpful. I was blown away by how beautiful and luxurious the rooms were and the views were amazing. We travel a lot and are used to a certain level of comfort, but Powerscourt really is something special. 

Our first evening meal was in the Sika restaurant and we were more than impressed with the food and service. On the second night we went to McGills for cocktails and food, it's an Irish bar in the hotel. Again, the food and service were faultless. 

Overall we would highly recommend staying there. We really enjoyed the beautiful grounds and the pool and spa are a must. The kids loved it and the pool was a definite high point for them.",5,2016,01,06
217,Fantastic stay always,"My self and my husband have stayed here on a number of occasions and have never been let down overall experience is fantastic. From staff to room comfort and drinking and dining is second to none. I don't have a bad thing to say about this hotel at all rooms are fab every room is spacious and the beds are so comfortable they make you never want to leave. 
The only thing that I miss from the hotel is that they don't allow dogs anymore we loved coming with our little pug Bella we loved walking her around the grounds such beautiful views and another walk I forget the name of it I think it's called the river walk fab walk with her. Even if you have no dogs to do the walks yourself are fab and the concierge gives you bottles of water for free and a map of all the walks you can do. 
Great place to bring the children they have great activities for the kids from 11am till 6pm only thing is you can't leave your kids you have to stay with them but great activities and a lovely playground with swings and a good green area to kick the ball around. 
All in all this hotel is great for everything romantic nights or family nights once you stay you will become very addicted and will always return. 

There is a lovely pub in enniskerry town called powerscourt arms absolutely fab food and great service. The hotel have free transport to drop you to the town and the pub or wherever you are can call them for you to be collected by them also and its in style think they have a BMW X5.
During the day you can walk to the town lovely little coffe shop called poppies fab food and cakes again you can walk or be dropped down by powerscourt bit of a walk but wear good walking shoes as it is a lovely walk.",5,2016,01,06
217,A welcome Festive treat,"A lucky return trip as a Christmas present to the sumptuous setting of the Powerscourt hotel. The surrounding landscape is a sight to behold on approach from the impressive driveway to the hotel entrance. The hotel itself is nestled right in the heart of the valley. Beautifully decorated for Christmas it looked just like a picture postcard. Check-in was very efficient, plenty of staff to attend and all of them most pleasant. The suite was stunning really spacious with beautifully arched windows allowing plenty of light. The glorious King size bed definitely deserves a mention owing to the best sleep in a long time! That was much needed after a visit to Mc Gills cosy bar for creamy Guinness and a huge portion of beef nachos to stave off hunger before dinner.
The pool and spa area are beautifully appointed and very well attended by helpful staff.
Evening dining was at the Sugar Loaf lounge with a wonderful surprise by way of entertainment, the very talented Paul Harrington singing & playing piano accompanied by an equally talented guitarist. Perfect ambiance for dinner loud enough to hear but low enough for conversation. Dinner was perfect delicious crab & salmon roulade beautifully fresh followed by a hearty beetroot risotto, completed by a delicious berry panacotta. See? I did mention the King sized bed was required! Wined and dined in a relaxed stunning location. Will I be back? First chance I get! Hats off to the staff for yet another wonderful stay.",5,2016,01,05
217,6 Stars☆☆☆☆☆☆,"My Wife and I stayed here for our second time on Sunday last. This was a Christmas gift for my Wife and to rate our stay with 5 stars is certainly not doing it justice. The hotel is stunning, simple as that. The setting, the staff, the service is 6 star. No less. We stayed in room 616, the powerscourt suite. Now this is the proverbial ""room with a view"". The attention to detail and the breathtaking views are magical. Special mention to accomodation manager Lizzette (appologies if I've mispelled your name) who was most friendly and helpful. Thankyou again. We will certainly be making a return visit in the near future. 6 Star hotel. Well done!",5,2016,01,05
217,"It was good, but expected much better","We went to Powerscourt for 31st december and stayed two nights. I have been there before and wanted to show my husband a great hotel whithin a few minutes from home!

This was a stay with heroes and villains... There were a few people that strived to make our stay an unforgettable time (Richard from reservations, Brian from guest relations and Joel at Sika hotel)... 

I believe the big ""villain"" in this review is the hotels' administration system. 

From the previous day to our arrival till the day after we left there were issues that showed us they didn't have great internal communication system. 

First, when we arrived there were issues with our reservation at Sika restaurant on new years eve. They didn't find the reservation... So one lady at reception thought it could be a good idea to offer the pub instead! Don't get me wrong, there's nothing wrong about having dinner in a pub... But when you've made a reservation in the hotels' finest restaurant 4 months in advance... It is a bit insulting when you're offered to spend new years' eve dinner in a pub... She even looked at me as if I was expecting so much, that was just what the system was showing... And there was nothing else she could do about it.

So of course our room wasn't ready yet... So whilst we were having a coffee I contacted Richard @ reservations who contacted Brian (guest relations) who solved the issue for us whithin an hour... 

The room wasn't ready at 4.00 either (as it should have been) but almost half an hour later...

The room was lovely, huge, and with a view to the mountains... Lovely! And the bed... Incredible! 

A couple of hours later Brian called to our room to apologise for the reception and make sure we were happy with the service from that moment forward... This made the whole difference and to be honest this is the kind of treatment I'm expecting from a 5* hotel... He also stated that our reservation at Sika was there all along but the girls at reception for some reason missed it.

Dinner at Sika was impressive, Joel made the evening even more special, trying to chat with our boy and go the extra mile to make sure we were happy... Amazing night, and will be going back!

The second day was brilliant... We enjoyed the swimming pool with our 3 year old boy. It was pretty much empty (even if the hotel was full). We went to the kids club area later, it was OK, I think I was expecting something a bit more organised (like the activities booklet detailed) but it was a place for kids to play... (Ok-ish)

In the afternoon we received some cookies and milk (what an amazing detail!) our little boy enjoyed them very much!

At night we ordered room service (it took about an hour to be delivered, and of course we had an outdated menu when we first called) tip for next time: book a table at sugar loaf restaurant in advanced.

Second morning, breakfast was delicious as always and the waiters incredible as well. 

The ""tough part"" came again when doing the check out. Of course they didn't have in the system the things we had from the mini bar and they charged for the dinner at Sika (even if it was included in the package we got) the guy at reception took note of all the changes and printed a new receipt with the amendments. He was really polite and when we told him the complementary waters were never replaced after our first day he didn't charge us for the two water bottles we drank from the minibar. 

We left powerscourt with hope that the reception was just bad timing, or whatever. Brian was there to greet us and make sure we had a pleasant stay after the first bumpy day...

The following day we received an email stating that they would need to charge us for two waters....(really?!?!) yup... We replied but haven't received any answer yet... Not a great last impression... 

Thanks to employees such as Richard, Brian, and Joel we will be returning... But there are some issues that were problems both times I was there, and it's the lack of communication between different departments and even between receptionists in the afternoon and at night... This kind of untidiness is not something I expect from a 5* hotel... Having the hotel full is not an excuse for this kind of hotel. ",3,2016,01,05
217,Girls Night Away. ,"I stayed in Powerscourt with a friend for a girls night away. The hotel was fab, the staff were so nice and helpful from the reception to the bar and spa. We were made to feel welcome and met with a smile and hello by any staff member who passed us.

The room we stayed in was really nice looking out at the mountain with a view of the fountain and giant chess board. The room was spotless and beds were so comfortable I was just sorry we were just staying one night. 

The swimming pool and spa area is so nice to chill out in and the staff were very helpful and yet again I was sorry I hadn't booked a treatment in the Espa spa, definitely  next time. 

We had a cocktail in the bar near foyer and ate in the bar downstairs, as we didn't want a formal sit down meal. The food was delicious with huge portions and a wide variety. As for the breakfast! Well worth dragging yourself out of the bed for. 

Overall I have to stay the hotel is a great place for a girlie night away, I will definitely be heading back there soon with the ladies! Even if its just for the breakfast!   

S.",5,2016,01,04
217,Excellent Stay,"Upon visiting this hotel for the 2nd time I was again impressed with the friendliness of the staff from check in to check out, nothing was too much trouble. We dined in McGills bar and the food was excellent and reasonably priced. It was my first time visiting the pool area and I have to say I was very impressed.
The surroundings of this hotel are beautiful and there are beautiful scenic walks to take. The rooms are fantastic and the size of our suite was a very pleasant surprise.
Breakfast as always here was a highlight.
Cannot recommend this hotel enough for a lovely break away from reality!",5,2016,01,04
217,An amazing relaxing trip,"We stayed in Powerscourt in November and we were blown away.  When we checked in we were shown to our room which had an amazing view of the gardens.  After settling in when went for afternoon tea in the sugarloaf lounge which can only be described as  beautiful and delicious.  The service was brilliant.  The waitress telling us about all the different treats and was very attentive to us.

The overall experience of Powerscourt was amazing and very relaxing we will defiantly be back.",5,2016,01,04
217,Very disappointing,"I visited Powerscourt with my family to celebrate my parent's 40th wedding anniversary. Having arrived at 12:30, we were told that our room wasn't ready and that we would be phoned when the room was ready. We then ate in the foyer. The food was delicious however the service was quite poor, we were left waiting approximately 20 minutes for three coffees and a tea, and had to ask the waitress twice what the delay was. 

Following on from this, there were multiple mix ups with our booking. Our party had booked three rooms and myself and my wife were mistakenly given the keys of the room which my parents had already checked into, twice, and we didn't get the keys of our room until 4:35, despite the guaranteed check in time being 4:00p.m. I had to make multiple trips to the check in desk to get the problems sorted and there was a sizeable queue each time. The check in desks seemed to be ill equipped to deal with the volume of customers in the hotel.

When we finally got into the room, our luggage hadn't been transferred to the room, even though we were told that it had been transferred. The luggage arrived a short time later after we phoned the desk, however some items of clothing were missing. Furthermore, we were given the wrong, upgraded room, which was should have been given to my parents. 
Then, having turned on the tv in the bathroom, it stopped responding to the remote control and we phoned the desk to ask somebody to call up to the room to sort it(turn it off). 30 minutes later, nobody had arrived and we had to phone again to get this issue sorted. Despite these issues, the room was very comfortable.

We ate in the Sika restaurant that night and the food and service was excellent. We particularly enjoyed the chocolate dome dessert.

The buffet breakfast the next morning was disappointing. The sausages were undercooked/cold and the scrambled egg was cold.

All in all, we were completed underwhelmed by our experience and would definitely not go back.",2,2016,01,03
217,Disappointed,"I arrived in Powerscourt on the 2nd of January. I have wanted to visit this hotel for quite a while and was really looking forward to my stay. On arrival, our check in experience was only average. We were not told what time breakfast was in the morning, or where it was located, or very much about the hotel at all. The food was nice but very overpriced. There was a mis match between the prices quoted in the online menu and the prices on the menu in the bar. The room and the leisure centre were both lovely. The breakfast was average and we were not told we could order something from the kitchen, however we heard other guests being informed of this. I certainly would not be in a rush back to this hotel.",2,2016,01,03
217,A great anniversary!,"We were really impressed with this hotel and especially with the size of our suite. We were amongst other things very impressed with the rooms, the bathroom (and the mirror tv), the room service was also excellent. The hotel was fully booked but still we received great attention and really had no complaints. We only wished we stayed for more than one night! We will definitely return!",5,2016,01,02
217,"Nice, but certainly not great","We decided to take an extended break over the festive season to Powerscourt.  In summary, it was nice but we could not help but feel that something was amiss.  Being a Platinum Marriott member, I was hoping that this might also tip the scales of service in our favour.

We booked a mountain-facing room, where we had amazing views of Sugarloaf Mountain.  Rooms are generously sized, and the bathrooms are luxurious - complete with a TV and double vanity.  For our first evening, we were surprised at the lack of turndown service.  We subsequently understood we had to specifically request it.  Sadly, this was not made clear to us at check-in.  What was considerably more surprising, however, was how thin the walls are between the rooms.  We were subjected to our neighbours exploring romance rather noisily in the early hours of the morning.  Two nights later, we had to call down (again) to complain about the TV in the other adjoining room (at 3am).

Service at the reception desk left us underwhelmed.  When we called out about noise in both instances, the staff seemed disinterested.  When we called down at the second occurrence, we were actually told by the reception desk that the noise was impossible.  Also, we asked the front desk to order a cab for us on the 26th and were told it would be 15 minutes.  At 30 minutes, we called down again to enquire whether the cab had arrived, only to be told that no cab had been ordered.  When we questioned this, the lady on reception simply told us that there was no record of us calling and that we were clearly mistaken, and we could come downstairs to the lobby to wait for the cab again.

There are a number of dining areas in PowersCourt.  We used all except the cafe at the spa.

Sugarloaf Bar is a lovely place for a coffee or a glass of wine in the evening, with a good selection of sweet treats during the day too.  Getting tables can be frustrating, however.  Every day, the majority of tables were ""reserved"" and we were relegated to a corner table.  In every instance, the ""reserved"" tables stayed open for hours.  (We were relaxing and had time on our hands.)  When we asked to reserve a table for later in our stay, we were simply told by the staff that tables could not be reserved.  Bizarre.  Nonetheless, if you can get a table, the food is pretty good and evening drinks are a treat there too.

The Sika restaurant is the hotel's fine dining option.  It's not Michelin star, but the service and food is pretty good as far as fine dining establishments go.  The chocolate sphere for dessert is worth cheating your diet for.  The pork belly is also a good main course option.

I would say that the highlight was the McGills pub.  It had a lovely festive atmosphere, great drinks and cocktails and also wonderful food.  Probably the best value for money in the hotel.  On the 26th, they had live music which complemented the festive atmosphere.  A lovely place to while away time while people-watching.

The other amenities of the hotel are pretty good.  A very well proportioned gym which was ideal for working off festive calories.  The ESPA spa is a fairly high standard, and the pool area alongside is a lovely spot to relax in too.  If you want peace and quiet, be sure to visit during the kids-free times.

If you do visit, make a point of visiting the Powerscourt Gardens too - they are truly gorgeous and worth paying to walk through.

The question is whether I would visit here again.  The answer is probably not.  I don't like having to argue with hotel staff about what I've said and done.  That said, I would certainly visit Ireland and the area again.",3,2016,01,01
217,Poor experience I'm afraid ,"This was our 5th time staying in the hotel but the first under it's new ownership. We like this hotel but there were a lot of issues with our stay. 

As mentioned by others breakfast time is chaotic. They have a poor system in place. Wait staff don't clear as they come to a table so when a party finishes eating the number of plates and dishes (given its a buffet) makes the task arduous. Hence, the queues of people waiting at the door for a table. So much so they have put a coffee machine in the hall to appease hungry guests! C'mon guys, surely you can find a breakfast system which works! 

We all found the food at the entrance level restaurant to be mediocre, and again staff didn't appear to take ownership of a given area. It was really difficult the night we were there to get someone's attention! 

Both nights we stayed our bedroom lights came on full in the room in the middle of the night. Given my wife was beside me snoring I can vouch it wasn't her! I rang reception twice to report this during our stay (we couldn't switch our air conditioning off either) but nobody came to the room nor did a staff member call us back to explain what was going on. If staff are aware of mechanical faults then again there should be a system for explaining to guests what the issue is. 

We won't be returning any time soon I'm afraid.

217,"5 Star treatment, & 5 Star prices","The Powers Court hotel is a very good hotel. The staff are fantastic, extremely courteous & attentive. 
It's a little expensive when there, food & drink prices a little excessive. The McGills Bar isn't in keeping with the hotel, obviously for the American visitors. Daft prices for such a setting.",4,2015,12,31
217,Disappointed,Stayed here for 3 nights over the Xmas period. Definitely not a five star. Reception lovely Rooms lovely. The dining was very disappointing 65 euro for dinner wasn't overly expensive but we found the menu very bland food was tasteless. Food in lounge was much nicer than restaurant. That is if you have patients to wait for it. Very slow service. Will not be returning to this hotel😟😟😟,3,2015,12,28
217,Mind-blowing views!,"We had a Groupon and when we booked the trip we didnt expect the hotel to be THAT regal. I was in utter shock when we pulled onto the property, I thought we made a wrong turn! Gorgeous views, amazing staff, delicious food, and a lovely little bar. And I was there during the WINTER! I can only imagine how amazing it is in full bloom. Very classic design. The drive to Dublin isn't too bad once you get the hang of the small roads. There's also a little village nearby the hotel will drive you to and pick you up. HIGHLY RECOMMENDED.",5,2015,12,28
217,Lovely but small misgivings from a regular guest,"We stay here several times a year. It's very busy and they asked us to book pool times in advance as a result. We had no objections to this as that's better than over crowding at peak times. In the end they didn't check this and pool was fine , which made us wonder why they bothered contacting guests. Maybe to manage their expectations.  Anyway not a five star /4 star thing to do but I figure they are trying to ensure pool not too full. They should follow thru and check it. 

One thing I did find weird was lots of guests (6) hanging around in normal clothes edge of pool. Maybe enjoying watching grandkids/friends swim etc but seemed strange to allow that for extended period when busy. 

Went to bar for kids food at 6. Giant mistake. Rugby match on so not a seat and loads of kids running around . I mean running. Felt a bit butlins. But hey it's Christmas and families are getting together but they refused to serve bar food even a toasted sandwich for a child nearby. We had to get room service (50 euro when we got some coffee too). I felt annoyed that when are regular guest one is shoved off to room service at 6pm.  

Our room had kids racing up and down corridor so much we had to watch it leaving room to avoid kids smacking into you ! Again they are just bored ESP older ones (9/12) as there is little to do. 

Kids club is worn but small fixes are cheap -they air hockey table hasn't had pucks for months -I almost feel like buying some on eBay for 3 euro and bringing some next time. It's staffed so why don't they just maintain the equipment a little better . It has improved but it's mainly broken board games but a lovely cinema room v nicely refreshed recently. 

Breakfast is superb. Room is beautiful . We are back again soon and I almost wonder should we book a table on bar for a non peak time to feed kid as its really deeply packed and unpleasant at core times. Actually the issue is no casual dinning spot (lounge booked solid till 930pm!). In most high end hotels you can get something snacky , here you can't really and it's a bit cut off. It was built for a different demographic/Ireland but it is adapting well to a new market. It's much more relaxed than it used to be and there is a positive sense of new ownership.

With a few quibbles, it's a very fine hotel, just frustrating as a few tweaks and it would be perfect.

The building outside is showing wear but inside its v perfectly maintained and spotlessly clean

Beautiful lobby too ",4,2015,12,27
217,Playing catch up to most 4 stars,"I usually stay in 4 Stars. I went 5 star as a pre-Christmas treat for my mam. We arrived in the 22nd of December. The hotel did have Christmas decorations, but no festive atmosphere at all. My visions of a piano in the background and mulled wine brewing were quickly erased. The room was nice with plenty of room and nice beds.  We ate a late lunch in the lounge which was good however, the waitress was a bit odd telling me I was bold for having my long awaited pint of Guinness, I live abroad. We were joined by two friends in the evening. We had a drink in the lounge and decided to go to the bar, Mc Gills. After paying the same waitress, and digesting her next, awkward comment we headed off. The bar had no music, darts on the TV and again zero atmosphere. That evening we had an early night as there was very little else to do. The breakfast was very good and also the service. However under the tables were dusty and really grubby, not up to 5 star expectations. I have to say I really enjoyed the spa. No children after midday and really lovely pool and hot tub but there is another but.....the gym had buckets on the floor to catch leaks in the ceiling, again not what you expect from 5 star.  The second night we decided to go off piste and went to Enniskerry. Here we enjoyed good, honest, Irish food and a lively atmosphere. We returned to the hotel to be met with no atmosphere again. I even went up all the floors in case I was missing something. We admitted defeat and went for a second early night. Overall this place is seriously over priced for what is on offer. Myself and my very easily pleased mam both agreed we would not return.",3,2015,12,25
217,Amazing,"We held our Christmas party here recently and I thought it was a fantastic place.

The staff were friendly and efficient, the buildings themselves were stunning and in a beautiful location.

The food and drink was top quality, I could not fault any part of our experience.",5,2015,12,20
217,Beautiful rooms but rest not inspiring,"We stayed here after a wedding in Powerscourt House. When ringing to confirm my room, the staff were not just unhelpful but actually downright rude. We were told that as residents we could use the hotel bar until 3.30am but when we got back after the wedding at 2.45am they refused us all. They service and manner in way of speaking to people was appalling. We ended up ordering room service to the room of 1 pot of tea and 3 sandwiches and it cost is over €40. 

On the bright side the rooms were just beautiful, big, modern, spacious and overlooking the Sugarloaf mountain. We had booked 3 different mountain view suites and they were all vastly different. The one on the 6th floor was by far the nicest, huge and spacious. The 5th floor one was still nice but much smaller. In contrast, the 4th floor (which is technically the ground floor as there are 3 floors below ground) was much smaller and not as nice. 

The breakfast was big and lovely and varied but cost about €120 for 5 people. 

Overall the hotel itself is nice but the standard has really dropped since leaving the Ritz and becoming part of the autograph collection. ",3,2015,12,15
217,upscale,Spent 2 nights at the Powerscourt Hotel. Very nice hotel. Spacious rooms. Large bathrooms with separate shower and tub. TV in bathroom. Large closet and changing area. Wish we could have stayed longer.,5,2015,12,15
217,Return visit,"We decided to book into Powerscourt last minute for a pre Christmas treat. We had visited twice before when it was the Ritz Powerscourt. Really nothing much has changed since the Marriot group took it over. The hotel looks the same except for the Skia restaurant which has had a makeover and is now more modern . I have to comment on all the staff , they were all so nice and friendly. Suite was beautiful and spotlessly clean and very comfortable bed. Only fault was no turn down service, which I would definitely expect in a five star hotel and no paper in the morning either.  Was quite shocked to discover on my return home that the bottled water in the room was charged for??? I have never had to pay for water in my room in any other hotel I have stayed in. I think when you are spending 370 euro a night, water should be , included. It certainly was when it was the Ritz!! Dinner was delicious , especially the chocolate sphere dessert! Would have liked some veg on the side and mash potato is not the most exciting side in this day and age!  These are only small niggles. 

Powerscourt is a beautiful hotel and there is lots to do around it but unfortunately it was raining so we were not able to do the Powerscourt gardens.",5,2015,12,14
217,Beautiful Hotel close to Dublin,"My girlfriend and I stayed here for my 50th birthday, we got a 8 day package deal that got has 8 nights here, flights to and from Chicago and a rental car for the entire trip.  We were seeing Ireland for the first time and we were doing it in December when the sun is only out for 8 hours a day and it is chilly all day.  Powerscourt is beautiful and very close to Dublin.  It is very easy to get to it since it is close to major highways.  The room was massive with a huge bathroom with a hot tub and a walk in shower.  The service was excellent and they had free coffee and fruit and cookies in the lobby.  The concierge was very helpful with all our questions and suggested some good places for us to visit and to eat at.  The grounds were beautiful even at this time of the year. I highly recommend this place to anyone visiting Ireland",5,2015,12,13
217,Quiet luxury in the outskirts of Dublin,"I was in Dublin for a week-long business trip and decided to take a couple of days R&R in the countryside at the Powerscourt Hotel, a lovely Palladian mansion on a bucolic 1,000 acre estate near the little town of Enniskerry in County Wicklow. The hotel is extremely well-tended and the grounds are magnificent, perfect for a romantic evening stroll or solitary meditation. The meals were excellent, the service impeccable. The indoor pool and spa were an unexpectedly lovely treat.",5,2015,12,12
217,Xmas work do- super time had by all ,"Stunning hotel set in beautiful surroundings. Attentive and friendly staff and excellent facilities including a great spa. 
The hotel is HUGE you'll walk miles getting everywhere 
Fabulous room with ESPA toiletries, great bed, lounge area, big wardrobe. Really everything was fantastic 
Would happily stay again 
Great breakfast too ",5,2015,12,10
217,If Carlsberg did Hotels......,"..This would PROBABLY  be the best five star hotel in Europe.  

I had the pleasure of staying in this amazing hotel for a Black Tie Ball on Saturday.  It is without doubt one of the nicest hotels I've visited.  Despite the fact that this is a relatively new building it has a timeless design with the most stunning backdrop of The Sugar Loaf Mountain and a classy and comfortable interior.  Hats off to David Webster and his team they have got it right.  This hotel is a pure retreat with excellent facilities and warm and welcoming staff.  Attention to detail is visible everywhere especially in the superb bedrooms.  They really are luxurious and so well maintained.  Banqueting and breakfast service was efficient warm and unpretentious.  Well done Team Powerscourt, We'll be back.  

",5,2015,12,06
217,Swimmingpool,"I was looking at your 10 most amasing hotel pools. I think you need to ad this to the list, it was really amasing. And so was the hotel, absolutly grand.
Nearby is the old mansion and garden and opposit a golfcource with 36 holes.",5,2015,12,04
217,Wedding anniversary.,"We specially booked this hotel for our 5th wedding anniversary. 
The Hotel and grounds are amazing, large bedrooms and beautiful swimming pool.

We planned to dine in the restaurant but unfortunately only set menu was available so we were advised to go to the bar. I was slightly disappointed to see Irish pub instead of the bar you would expect in 5star property. It is nice for others traveling to Ireland for the first time to experience. There was good choice of food. It's pity we were not informed about alternative to dine on the lobby area, we would have enjoyed it more.
Breakfast in the room was lovely. 
The only let down for me was the staff. Very professional but not warm. No personal touch. Our wedding anniversary was not acknowledged at all. So we were not spoiled. 
I would return in future, hope to get better experience, as the property is amazing. 
",4,2015,12,01
217,Relaxing Stay at Powerscourt,"My husband and I spent 5 nights here in November 2015 and really enjoyed the spacious room and thoughtful service. The suites are enormous and have so much storage space. We had no idea when we booked that the setup would be so perfect for such a long stay. Our room had a double-walk-in closet; a huge marble bath with separate shower and tub and dual sinks; a separate sitting area with a comfortable couch and wing chair; and one of the biggest beds I've ever slept in. There was plenty of storage, which meant we could really settle in and not feel like we were living out of our suitcases for a few days. 

The breakfast buffet was a great way to start each day. It included hot and cold items and the tastiest buffet scrambled eggs I've ever had. We didn't eat at Sika for dinner during our stay but did have dinner and snacks at McGill's bar. The fish and chips were not great but the wings and burger were pretty good. The spa is lovely, though we didn't actually use any of its services. 

Rooms include an honor bar and 4 complimentary bottles of water per day. The hotel offers many estate activities, including golf. They have a number of walking trails and will arrange for cycling, horseback riding, and other outings.

The Powerscourt hotel is conveniently located not far from central Dublin and near the M50 for easy access to the airport. It was a good home-base for exploring the eastern part of the country. I'd recommend it to anyone looking for modern convenience and comfort for a longer stay.",5,2015,11,30
217,Perfect for the absolutely spoilt,"I went here with three of my lovely female friends in late November, after spending a day Christmas shopping at the lovely Kildare outlet. The hotel is situated in an incredibly beautiful spot, with stunning views, surrounded by lush greens (golf course, if you fancy) and very amazing facilities. 
We ate in the Sika restaurant, fine dining, and followed up on Sunday morning with a beautifully presented breakfast and an hour in the hotel's gorgeous ESPA, pool, steam room etc.
For a weekend of absolute bliss this is the way to go. Mind the gap.... It is not cheap, but truly worth it.",5,2015,11,26
217,Pure Relaxation,"We spent our Mini Moon here in July. This hotel was everything we needed. It was easy to get to, the check in was quick - it was made even better when the receptionist informed us we had been upgraded. The suite was so spacious. The large balcony with views of the mountains was very welcome especially when the weather was so warm at the time., We even were able to sit out in the restaurants balcony to have breakfast on all three mornings. The hotel bar was real cosy and the food was very comforting. The fine dining restaurant was amazing - the chef even did a special honeymoon plate for us. The spa was superb, so relaxing.
You are a short walk from powerscourt house and gardens which was lovely to visit. However you would need to drive to reach the waterfall. 
We are definitely planning a return trip to this hotel.",5,2015,11,24
217,Out of this world hotel,"Having spent many weeks away with work and wanting to treat the family we booked the Powerscourt  Hotel. The drive up to the hotel is magnificent and so to is everything about the hotel. We stayed in suite that was astoundingly luxurious and being an engineer had some cool features the a TV mirror in the bathroom which the kids loved.

The pool makes you feel like you've entered space with its dark black quartz tiles. and the staff made us feel very welcome.  The views of the mountains and gardens kept the kids busy.",4,2015,11,24
217,Total opulence,"A fantastic hotel, with impressive views, brilliant grounds, fantastic rooms and a luxurious spa. 4 stars due to a mess up at booking, apart from that, a great hotel, mainly aimed at couples but may also suit families .",4,2015,11,21
217,Lovely luxurious place if you can afford it,"I stayed here for work. It is spectacular. The swimming pool is amazing, the bathroom in my room has a telly on the mirror (!), we had our breakfast with a spectacular view, etc. Will definitely return for those once in a blue moon treats.",5,2015,11,18
217,The conference location that makes a difference,"As I attended a healthcare conference in Dublin I arrived in this beautiful city the third time. First I thought about the 45 minutes car drive that this hotel is really remote and there is no chance having some fun like being in a pub in Dublin.

I was wrong. The Powerscourt Hotel welcomed me in a way I was fascinated, impressed, overwhelmed. The service, the interior, the building, the park. The evening I arrived I stopped my WOWs only when I fell asleep.

Besides the delicious food the impressive conference facilities convinced me again - if the venue is really supporting your concentration, good mood and inspirations within a unique environment - it is a succesful conference, exchange of knowledge, getting some ideas about the future.

For me the Powerscourt enhanced a sustainable moment for me. Now doubt about that. I dont have any special hints, just go there. For Business or other purposes.",5,2015,11,16
217,Fantastic relaxing stay at this hotek,"Let me start quoting my husband for 20 years ""this is probably the best weekend ever"" and we do travel quite frequently.
But the hotel was great, we had booked a suite as we were to celebrate our 20th wedding anniversary, but I am sure even without a suite that the room at this estate are good.
So one thing is the hotel, then there is the nature around it, absolute marvelous... If you go there make sure you have time for walks around the estate and when you leave, ensure you have time to drive around as the nature here is something you don't want to miss out on.
Hotel has Spa, and opportunity for different treatments, best was 1. A pool/spa where there are set times for kids in the area 2) treatment are has a silent relaxation room with view over the garden, you need to be more than 16 years...
So for adults who needs a bit of heaven for a couple of days, this is ideal",5,2015,11,14
217,Good accommodation . Terrible food,Stayed here over the bank holiday weekend at the end of October. Our room was really lovely and gorgeous bathroom. However that was as far as it went. No availability in the restaurant so could only eat in the bar or in a lounge area. The bar is like an old Irish pub downstairs and dark not what one wants in a five star hotel. The only other option is an area off the lobby which they call a lounge. The food is outrageously expensive club sandwich €17.95 and not good. They served a very stingy bruschetta cold. Dinner was not much better and they ran out of desserts. If we had had one they were tiny canapé type things at 5.95 each. Breakfast was fairly standard. The other problem was that we had no access to the thermal suite unless we were having treatments. The pool only. We actually had treatments the previous day but we're not made aware of this..Would never go back they really need to up their game.,2,2015,11,12
217,Both more and less than you expect,"The hotel is a modern, purpose-built hotel cut into the hillside of the Powerscourt estated in Wicklow. A lot of effort was made to parallel the Georgian features of the historic house, and to disguise the buildings roots as an upmarket chain hotel (first Ritz-Carlton, now I think Marriott)- and more of it is successful than not. We stayed in 602, which I think is the nicest non-suite room in the hotel. Stunning views across to the Sugar Loaf, comfortable and spacious (including the bathroom, which had an unusually good layout. Despite the following negative points, we genuinely enjoyed our weekend break there. 

For the price, though, there are some things that should simply be done better. We reported a problem with the air conditioning: 36 hours nothing had been done. The scones at tea are like hockey pucks: heavy, solid, devoid of flavor. There is simply no excuse in Ireland for scones that bad (especially with Avoca serving really good ones just down the way at the Estate). Breakfast on weekend mornings is chaos. We were sent from the main dining room upstairs b/c they were too busy for us - and when we got upstairs were sent back downstairs b/c they were too busy. We were understanding the first time, less so the second. The wi-fi is problematic, dropping out briefly but frequently (yes, even in a beautiful place, electronics have their uses!)

Finally, it seems that the hotel is heavily frequented by south Dublin families (it was the week after half-term break had ended, so this wasn't holiday visitors). I was pretty impressed by how nice the kids were- they all seemed cheery and well-mannered, in happy family groups- but there were a LOT of them. We were looking for an adult weekend away so were perhaps a little less enthused than we would have been if we had had our kids with us!",4,2015,11,12
217,"Unfortunately, left feeling cheated.","Let me first say this is on some very beautiful property and makes for a very lovely home base to explore.  The rooms are spacious and well decorated. Breakfast was very well prepared and the service personnel very helpful and pleasant.

Now the bad.  My party had two rooms for our 5 night stay.  We arrived well after the established check in time, but still had to wait a considerable time, as neither room was ready.  The worst part, I had to argue with the staff to obtain a late check out.  Apparently they have no problem at all with taking time from you, and see no reason whatsoever to give it back.  Having top tier Marriott Elite Status really made no difference at this hotel for checking in, checking out, or anything in between.

My second compliant was with the eagerness of the staff to convert my charges to my home currency (as a convenience) even though I specifically told them I wanted to pay in local currency (besides a bad conversion rate, you get charged for that convenience - always pay in local currency).  

Anyway, I did bring the matters to the attention of the hotel and eventually received somewhat of an apology.",3,2015,11,12
217,Amazing hotel... unforgettable weekend,"My wife and I celebrated her birthday in the wonderful Powerscourt Hotel. We started our weekend with an amazing Afternoon Tea in the Sugar Loaf Lounge. It was incredible from start to finish. 

The rooms are stunning, very modern yet classy. We were lucky to get a ground floor suite and it was bliss. The rooms are quiet and comfy. 

The food in both the lounge and in the Sika restaurant was first class. We had two super meals.

My wife really enjoyed the spa and I too enjoyed how relaxing the place was. 

It's hard to find anything to fault in Powerscourt Hotel. From start to finish the break was one of the best weekends we have ever had away. All the staff couldn't do enough to make us feel so welcome. 

Before we headed for home after checking out we spent some time exploring the beautiful grounds and played with the huge chess set. The view from the gardens of the Sugar Loaf has to be seen to be believed.",5,2015,11,10
217,beautiful location,"I have had lunch many times in the Sugar Loaf Lounge in this hotel.  Today, the tree lined drive up the avenue to the hotel was an absolute delight bursting with autumnal colour in what was a gloriously warm autumn day in Dublin. And lunch was excellent as usual. We both chose a delicious soup of the day served with three types of breads.  I followed with the goats cheese croquettes and my companion chose the beef burger.  The food was very good and the service was friendly and helpful.  Lunch lasted two hours seated at one of the tables by the windows in the autumn sunshine.  Beside us a group arrived for Afternoon Tea which looked amazing and for which I must return one of these days soon.",5,2015,11,10
217,Absolutely Fabulous!,"We arrived early but it was absolutely no inconvenience for the charming, friendly and welcoming Irish staff.  We received a warm welcome and the reception staff graciously introduced us to the hotel, its amenities and our lovely room, checking us in straight away!  The hotel is GORGEOUS, our suite with beautiful views of Sugarloaf was extremely comfortable and spacious.  The staff is all caring and truly invested.  5 stars for sure!  We enjoyed meals at SIKA and McGill's, both within the hotel, everything was delicious and again, super, friendly staff.  The breakfast buffet is amazing  Powerscourt Gardens is a must-see, its an hour to stroll around and admire the outstanding gardens (or longer if you like).  In Enniskerry, we enjoyed a delicious lunch at POPPIES and one day we had a fabulous afternoon tea at KENNEDY'S.  There is a gift shop in the village between these two restaurants and the gentleman who owns the shop was most helpful in providing us with information about day trips.  Glanadlough and the Monastic Ruins are absolutely beautiful.  We frequently travel internationally and this is one of the best hotels we've ever stated in.",5,2015,11,10
217,Wonderful visit.,"Stayed at the Powerscourt Hotel for one night and everything was superb.  Friendly, efficient staff, beautiful surroundings, comfortable room, dinner & breakfast were so good.  I am nitpicking with my one complaint which is the hotel is extremely warm.  Am looking forward to a return visit!",5,2015,11,09
217,5-star service in a beautiful area,"Booking, check-in and porters went very well. Staff were friendly and very professional - like a well oiled machine. We were treated to an end room which I can thoroughly recommend for space and facilities. Everything was spotlessly clean. The bed was the most comfortable we had experienced. We ate in the Sika restaurant - see separate review. The health club was available to hotel guests. It provided a beautiful relaxing experience. The changing rooms were comfortable and there were plenty of fresh towels and  chilled water. The pool is a good size and is a suitable depth for less confident swimmers.The pool-side couches encouraged relaxation. The area around the hotel provides stunning parkland leading to a large garden centre and Powerscourt house.  We will return as soon as possible.",5,2015,11,07
217,Terrible Accident - Management Couldn't Care Less,"Initially everything seemed fine at the hotel and we were happy. We had good food at McGill's and had a good evening. Next morning my husband was given a bike on which the brakes didn't work we took the the route suggested by the hotel on the maps they give to you. The route is very steep down hill needless to say he had a severe accident because the hotel's bike was faulty. He went down the hill at break neck speed and couldn't stop and finally went head first into the trees at the bottom of the hill. He cut his face, arms, head and still has very bad pain in his left shoulder after a week. My bike was fine and so I was alright. I informed the hotel of this and have never received an apology from anyone or any attempt to compensate us for his injuries and the ruining of our holiday. We had to wait for 2 hours for ice to be sent to our room & then I had to call again to ask for it. This was the first day of our holiday in Ireland and he had severe pain for the whole trip. Does anyone at Powerscourt care? No definitely not!",1,2015,11,05
217,5 Star Experience from the moment you walk through the doors,"I won a one night's stay in an executive room with dinner in the Sika restaurant in Powerscourt hotel, at a charity event and was really looking forward to staying.  The original date we choose to stay I had to reschedule and the hotel were very accommodating, so first-off before even stepping into the hotel I had a positive experience.  

When we got there, we were greeted very warmly at the reception desk and a gentleman asked if he could take our bags for us.  Once registered and checked-in, a lovely gentleman took our bags and showed us to our room.  Not only that but he also explained and showed us all the features in the room, how to use the touch pad system, breakfast times, how to access the spa, the wifi code, etc....  One really cool thing about our room, apart from the fact that it was bigger than my house, their was a TV in the mirror.  Brilliant. 

Once we got to explore the room, it was clear that the people staying in the room before us, used the balcony as a ""smoking area"" .  Neither me nor my partner are smokers so we weren't too impressed with this. Called reception and they had a gentleman up immediate to clean the balcony and apologise for the inconvenience.  

Initially we decided a bit of R&R was needed, so we availed of the spa facilities.  The spa was great - well kept and impeccably clean.  The facilities were great with lots of areas to simply relax and read a book or close the eyes.   We also chose to have a bit of lunch in the bar. The food and service were excellent but pricey.  However, given the 5 star experience you receive I guess this is to be expected.  We also ate in the signature restaurant and this was amazing.  The food was fantastic, the service perfect and it was a great way to end our night.  

The next morning, we had breakfast and it was simply out of this world.  Everything was laid-out beautifully and the staff were fantastic.  We ended up speaking to one gentleman and he was brilliant.  I asked if it was a nice place to work and he was so complimentary about the management and the other staff, I was brown away.  He was an older gentleman and clearly in the hospitality business for a number of years.  you would come back just because of him. 

The grounds of the hotel are stunning and well worth a stroll around before leaving.  Our room was fantastic - pure luxury and the views from our room were beautiful. 

Beautiful play to stay but it's the staff that make the experience a 5 star one.",5,2015,11,05
217,Overnight Girlie Getaway,"We stayed in a mountain view suite with a connecting double room, which you access through the walk in wardrobe.  It felt like a grown up Narnia! We all enjoyed a treatment in the spa and lounged about in our robes drinking prosecco. The space in the suite was fantastic with beautiful views. We also dined in the restaurant where the food and service was exceptional. 

It was without doubt the perfect girlie retreat.",4,2015,11,04
217,Amazing Hotel with over the top service!,"I just returned from a long road trip through Ireland which concluded with a 2 night stay with a 2 night stay at the powerscourt. Rooms are fantastic and the lobby is wonderful, but what we experienced from a service level is true of a five 5 star hotel. Traveling with our 9 month old son the entire staff came to meet him and make him smile. One of the staff members Suzanne Downey engaged us when we were giving our son a bottle and overheard that we were low on formula. She stated she would run to the corner store (a 25 minute trip) to get more for us and we told her that was not necessary and that we would pick some up on the morning on our way to the airport. After a quick conversation we thanked her for directions and making our son smile. In our room about an hour later the front desk called saying we had a package at the front desk and they were bringing it up. It was a container of baby formula. Coming from the hotel industry I know its the little things that make a luxury hotel truly 5 star. Nice sheets, lobby's, and bathrooms can be seen in the pictures, but over the top unexpected service is what makes a stay memorable. Suzanne should be commended!  																		",5,2015,11,01
217,5 star elegance in opulent country surroundings,"We were really looking forward to our night away, which exceeded our overall expectations.  Our spacious room was magnificent, oozing elegance and comfort.  Staff were very welcoming and professional.  We relaxed in the spa, which was not as luxurious as we expected comparing it to other five star spa experiences we have had.  However, in saying that we enjoyed the relaxation.  For dinner, we dined in Sika restaurant, which was amazing - the food was super delicious.  We would recommend that side dishes be added (not necessarily free) to the menu.  Breakfast, again in the Sika restaurant was varied and offered lots of choice.  We enjoyed it (apart from the sausages which did not taste nice - they were barely cooked), and we were set up for the day.  The grounds were manicured to perfection which added to the natural surroundings.  There is a bit of non expensive maintenance which needs to be undertaken e.g. gold plating in lift is faded and paint on the skirting boards in the Sika restaurant is falling off.  It did not impenge in any way on our stay but for a 5* hotel, I would have thought there would be on-going maintenance.  Overall, we absolutely enjoyed our 5* retreat and we most definitely will return.",5,2015,11,01
217,"Lovely hotel, restaurant pretty average","A beautiful setting with lovely countryside walks . The hotel rooms are fantastic. It's a beautiful hotel and given the surrounding , and price, expectations are understandably high. We decided to try their signature restaurant  , Sika, that evening and in hindsight my one recommendation is go local if you're looking for a meal to match the standards of the hotel. My Scallops were dry and over cooked, but that does happen from time to time so not a huge deal for. The  service was pretty poor and for a hotel of this standard I was expecting more.  I had a bottle of white to go with my food, which the server filled up once at the start and no sign until of him until the main courses, despite asking him after the starter and him forgetting . My wife had water, a resource in short supply , and equally hard to get !
I would have happily topped up myself but he left the bucket on the other side of the room. In the end I asked can he leave the bottle over by the table ( which he forgot) . Knowing he forgot to give us any attention until dessert and had 2/3's of a bottle of wine to dispose of , he then kept trying to top up even when the glass was half full. In the end I had to ask him to stop. ",3,2015,11,01
217,Genuine luxury 5* experience,"The room was amazing, balcony with amazing views of the mountains. The staff were all incredibly friendly and professional, and the food was great. I would definately recommend this hotel if you're looking to escape to a world of fabulosity :-)",5,2015,10,30
217,"Fabulous luxurious suite, great spa area",Returned to Powerscourt Hotel for a 2 night stay. Delighted to be upgraded to a suite. Very spacious rooms with fab decor. New much improved breakfast buffet with all the usual selections and the hot food was hot and served on warm plates. Plenty of choice and plenty of staff. Service was friendly and efficient. Looking forward to returning.,5,2015,10,29

217,Powerscourt outstanding romantic breathtaking adventure,"This hotel Is situated on a phenomenal estate 300+ years old that includes one of the most breathtaking garden exhibits we have seen. Sculptured, refined, mysterious yet quaint. If you are a garden aficionado this is worth the trip and a stones throw from the hotel. The hotel room was luxurious with a private doorbell entry and a  beautiful marble bathroom which included television in the mirror as well as music. The ceiling to floor windows opened up to an enchanting view (and a veranda) while the draperies were controlled with a bedside touch screen. The bedside touch screen also controlled the heating system. The employees were warm, friendly, professional  and always helpful. We will definitely return to the Powerscourt (now a Marriott).",5,2015,10,28
217,Outstanding,"Excellent hotel , the staff were friendly and efficent from the start till the end of our stay . enjoyed an overnight with my Wife . I really enjoyed the food in the Sika restraunt the staff were excellent and mcGills bar was a great place to watch the rugby semi finals.
The room was large and the decor well done with a large window to admire the views. The bathroom was like a work of art , with a large bath and a seperate shower and plenty or room . Tv built in to the mirror was a nice touch .
so many great views from every part of the hotel and nice local walks. My wife really enjoyed the Spa , looking forward to returning again",5,2015,10,28
217,Anniversary get away,"Best 5 star hotel in Ireland had an absolutely wonderful time, from the welcome, the food was beautiful and the spa was brilliant.  Nothing was any trouble for all staff mbers Will definitely be back here.",5,2015,10,27
217,Scenic paradise,"Driving through the beautiful Wicklow countryside to the hotel was the first part of our amazing experience here. We were greeted warmly on arrival. The rooms were beautiful - lots of space and, large, very comfortable beds with high quality sheets, very-well equipped bathrooms (with a TV in the mirror!), nice ESpa toiletries, and plenty of wardrobe space. The views from the rooms were magnificent. 

We had lunch in McGill's pub which was very tasty and staff members were very friendly. Dinner in the Sugar Loaf lounge was nice (but desserts were tiny and choices limited). However, we would highly recommend dinner in Sika Restaurant - fantastic service, delicious food (especially the Valrhona chocolate sphere - the highlight of the meal), all complemented by an amuse bouche to start with and petit fours after the meal. 

Just 30 minutes by car from Dublin, we really felt that we were getting away from it all. If you want a place to relax, sleep well, enjoy great scenery and wonderful food, consider staying in this hotel.",5,2015,10,26
217,"I want to keep it a secret, but it's out!","Stunning hotel in a beautiful location, with terrific views from the rooms, the restaurant, the Sugar Loaf Lounge and even the lobby! Rooms are classy and luxurious with plenty of space and exquisite furniture. Staff are friendly and welcoming. We stayed for one night on a sunny October day when the forests of trees surrounding the hotel reflected the entire Autumn spectrum of greens, yellows, oranges and reds. Close by is the awe-inspiring Powerscourt Waterfall providing wonderful photo opportunities. Families camping, hikers, cyclists, visitors from abroad make this a lovely daytime sightseeing venue.
The surrounding area of Enniskerry and the mountains and valleys of Wicklow complete this magnificent yet astonishingly well-hidden gem. The nearby village of Enniskerry is worth a visit, with its eclectic mix of cafes, small shops, pubs and homes.
Just one minor problem with the hotel room where the lighting was too poor for reading. Ambient - yes, practical - not really!  But it was an otherwise perfect stay.",5,2015,10,26
217,Family Lunch,"1pm Sunday met family for lunch in lounge area of the hotel.
Service was very good,the food was very tasty.We will return.
The view of the Wicklow mountains from the hotel is impressive.
Tourists can visit Avoca next door for some shopping if suits,or a leisurely stroll in the magnificient gardens.Beautiful part of Ireland.",5,2015,10,25
217,Amazing location,"A superb hotel, lovely suites, it even had a kitchen! Lovely views and close to the mountains. Close to Dublin but a world away from the frenetic pace of the city.  Didn't want to leave but thoroughly enjoyed my stay. Very courteous, friendly staff, thank you. ",5,2015,10,25
217,Gorgeous property,"Beautiful hotel, go here for a treat to yourself, we found it expensive but was lovely to go to see it and spend the night, the rooms are lovely and very big also, scenery is fabulous.  Staff were very friendly.  Food in the hotel restaurant was gorgeous.",5,2015,10,22
217,Spa day out.....,Visited with the Powerscourt Hotel Spa for a day of luxury!!  Before I even start I can just mention the location of the hotel is just amazing its well worth to fit in a good hour walk around the grounds....   I got a monthly special offer and a few other bits for a day in the spa.  It was lovely they really look after you,5,2015,10,22
217,Disappointing 5 star!,"For weeks I have been looking forward to my stay at the Powerscourt.Hotel. Sadly it did not go to plan. After we went to our room we decided to have some tea. I put some water in the kettle and as I was about to put it on to the stand I noticed some water. We all know water & electricity do not mix!!  the kettle was leaking so I phoned reception and asked for a replacement. 45 minutes went by and no sign of the kettle, we waited another 45 minutes and I called reception again. I got so frustrated I went back down to reception we are now almost 2 hours waiting on the kettle. Not the service that I would expect for a 5 star hotel! Plus for the 2 morning we had breakfast there were items missing off our table. You are asked if you would like tea/coffee then in the end you have to call a waiter to bring it to you. Its not that they are short of staff. Again I have better service at a B & B.",3,2015,10,21
217,Amazing Scenery,"I have celebrated my birthday on this beautiful hotel  and I have to say I had very good time! The service at the Lounge is outstanding, the ESPA  treatment that I had was amazing, it was the most relaxing massage ever. The water in the swimming pool was freezing. I enjoyed so much the jacuzzi and the serenity room!!!! In the hotel room I noticed that the air conditioning was not working at full heating temperature, but the view from the room was so beautiful!!!! ",4,2015,10,20
217,Great venue for mid week conference ,"We were so surprised by this wonderful resort hotel.

The rooms are generous in size with all the trimmings one would expect from a quality resort hotel.  The breakfast and lunch menu options are extensive and the quality equally good.

We also enjoyed 2 rounds of golf and the wonderful spa and gym , during our stay.

The hotel , although a little dated , still provides for a great experience. ",5,2015,10,20
217,Luxury plus,If you wish to impress someone (wife or girlfriend) this is the place. Luxury and soo romantic. I would love to return without the kids and just spend a few days walking and golfing or simply taking in the beautiful grounds. Get a stay at this place before it gets busy again and the rates head up. Concierge were very nice and really knew the area well.,5,2015,10,19
217,"Beautiful rooms,beautiful views, excellent place","We had a suite with a terrace on the 6th floor. Very elegant and expansive views. Loved the quiet and comfort. Great amenities such as bed side controls. Lots of closet and storage. This hotel is at the top of elegence.

Suggestions, towels need improvement... Too stiff and lean. Staff that has English as a second language as many did need to say I don't understand not just move ahead with partial or no understanding.

Sika restaurant was not great nor worth the price. Feedback given to manager.

Sugarloaf foodcwas excellent for lunch and dinner.

Excellent valet service. Laundry added all manner of scents even with instructions to not do so. If you don't like scents in your laundry call, don't write notes.",5,2015,10,18
217,Great!!,"As far as I understand this was a Ritz hotel, all I can say it was more than impressive! Heated floors, electronic curtains, great staff nice bar! But the best is the area where it's at!! 

We only stayed 1 night, but fire sure worth to stay at least a couple of nights! ",5,2015,10,15
217,Second Time round,"This was my second time in a short time to stay here, to say the first was a disaster was an understatement, we spoke to the manager after, he investigated everything we discussed and to say that Powerscourt came up trumps is an a massive understatement! We stayed in a gorgeous suite, , tons of room, more than we could ever need, I do love the lobby , it is like a busy hub of chit chat, sport lovers, lady's who like afternoon tea and weary parents treating themselves to a well earned break. That would be our category.We only had a one night stay, dinner in the Sika restaurant , great service, the food is up there with Chapter One in Dublin, a treat for an adult that wants to be well catered for. 
Breakfast is located in the Sika also, tons of selection, we were genuinely blown away by the great warmth of Robert Smyth , Lezette and Steffan in the hotel, thanks lads, we slept like royalty, ate like landed gentry and were treated like old friends. This gets my two thumbs fresh",5,2015,10,15
217,"Stunning hotel, service terrible","Myself and my friend stayed for one night here on Sunday 11th October, something which we had being looking forward to and saving for, for a long time.  The hotel and grounds are stunning, the views on approach and the surrounding area are breathtaking but the service from the time we arrived until we checked out was the worst I've ever encountered.  Not once did any member of staff either in the hotel or the spa or the McGills bar offer any form of basic service, it was just chronic - it's a 5* hotel!!  The receptionist on check in didn't explain anything or welcome us at all, didn't even tell us where the lifts where.  Thomas in the spa had the personality of a plank, it was like he really didn't want to be there.  Awful.  We had our dinner in McGills bar.  I asked for a salad plate, you swear I was was asking for gold leaf steak!  My friend had fish and chips of which the fish was very greasy.  We must have asked countless time for condiments (none were on the table).  Not once did anyone check on us.  Check out was the best entirely!  Sarah the receptionist, how she got a job there is beyond me!  Never asked how our stay was, hardly spoke to us.  In our room (beautiful room), be very aware, any treats left out are NOT a treat, you have to pay for everything, we got caught out.  Had to laugh at the wooden sticks, instead of a spoon, to use for a cup of tea/coffee - again - it's a 5* star hotel!!  I would have expected this service in a lower rated hotel but not at this level and not for such a reputable hotel.  Like I mentioned, the hotel really is beautiful, can't fault that but staff need a course in customer service - big time!!!!",3,2015,10,15
217,Excellent Experience.....,"We stayed at the Powerscourt for a business function in September. It was really excellent in every way. The service, staff, property, spa and food were superb. We also were really happy with their transportation company ""Tower Cabs"". Mark Mitchell, who owns the company gave us a great rate hourly rate and drove us all over Wicklow County and shared his homeland with us in a way that was super special and fun. The music at McGills pub was also fantastic. Thank you Eoin Woods. Thank you Powerscourt!!",5,2015,10,14
217,First class in every respext,"Could not praise this hotel more. First class service and staff, great rooms and fantastic bar, breakfast and facilities. Delighted to stay 2 nights. Rooms with even numbers enjoy the better views. The hotel provides a shuttle from enniskerry and back. 

Golf also excellent and the house grounds are impressive. 

Couple of pubs and the Italian in enniskerry was good with friendly staff.

",5,2015,10,14
217,Magnificent ,"Not only the views are magnificent!  As the saying goes, they had me at hello!  Friendly, beautiful, great rooms and service and food!  This is everything a first class hotel should be.  We took the private River Walk which drove our jet lag away!",5,2015,10,14
217,Great facilities and friendly staff but let down by AC and power,"We booked a suite for the night of our wedding and on arrival were delighted with the luxury of the rooms. The staff were extremely friendly and helpful. 

Unfortunately the evening was unseasonably warm and the room was stiflingly hot. When trying to lower the room temp with the AC we discovered it wasn't working, we rang reception and they sent somebody up straight away and were unable to fix the issue. Another staff member arrived and again couldn't get the AC to work. A fan was the only solution that was offered which unfortunately did little more than circulate the hot air. 
We ended up sleeping on the sofa in the sitting room as the AC worked there, not ideal for your wedding night!
We had a lovely breakfast in the room in the morning, then the power cut for the room so we cut our losses and left early. 
I raised the issues with the reception staff and did receive an apology, however I felt that we paid for a 5 star experience  that we did not receive.",3,2015,10,14
217,Yum yum ,We stayed for one night and had dinner in the restaurant. The diverse menu offered something for all. And no matter what you order the quality and deliciousness are second to none. We ordered from the set menu which was €65 pp and it was worth every penny. Our plates were cleared. The staff were very helpful and attentive. The hotel and accommodation were beautiful and very clean. The beds were very comfortable and all in all I would return in a heartbeat. While it is on the expensive side and the drinks at the bar were pricey in general it was great value. ,4,2015,10,13
217,Luxury hotel!,"Spent 1 night at this hotel. Loved the location, the rooms were very luxurious, and the staff helpful. Ate at the pub downstairs which was surprisingly reasonable considering the hotel we were in. Swam in the pool which was very spa like and had room service breakfast just so we could enjoy the room with balcony. Would stay here again in a heart beat!!",5,2015,10,12
217,Beautiful ,"Beautiful  hotel, the room was amazing, swimming  pool was stunnng. Great location and  the complimentary bicycles were great  to use!  Beautiful  grounds, we had a perfect  stay. Will definitely return again in the near future.",5,2015,10,12
217,Very Special Treat,"My husband brought me to stay at Powerscourt for two nights as a first wedding anniversary treat.  The whole experience was out of this world, from the amazing food, excellent service and heavenly spa.  He had ordered a standard room but the suite standard room that we stayed in was second to none.  Having the gardens, Avoca and waterfall all within close proximity, all really added to our stay.  Hopefully we can return next year and make this an annual event!",5,2015,10,12
217,"Beautiful hotel, beautiful surroundings, terrible service","I had been looking forward to this hotel the most because of its beautiful location.  It’s a former Ritz Carlton property that is located inside the Powerscourt Gardens and overlooks Sugarloaf Mountain.  The rooms were gorgeous, the scenery was beautiful, but the service was absolutely terrible.  

From the moment we checked in until breakfast the last morning, I felt like we were a burden on the hotel staff.  There was no one to help with bags, no directions to our room, and certainly no platinum arrival gift.  We ordered dessert from room service one night and they called back 15 minutes after we ordered, “What do you want again?”  It took another 45 minutes to get a cookie and ice cream delivered.  We asked for towels to be sent up because they didn’t service our room throughout our entire stay – they never showed up.  My husband went down to breakfast where he was told “he wasn’t on a list” and instead of being allowed to sit while they figured it out, they made him stand and wait for 15 minutes IN AN EMPTY RESTAURANT.   
Breakfast was a spread of fruit, pastries, and some hot food – it ended up being free for platinum members, but I’m not sure how much I would pay for it if it didn’t come with your room rate… which the front desk staff so graciously pointed out at check-in instead of letting me know that it was, in fact, a platinum benefit.  I know they were hosting Toshiba while we were there, but that’s no excuse for poor service.  Lastly, they double charged us for the room – which was only rectified after a series of emails.  I brought the issues to the attention of Marriott International, who turned it over to the property (which appears to be what they are doing all the time now), and I got a half-hearted apology that was so insincere that I wish I hadn’t reached out at all.  

It’s a short drive from a small little town that has a couple of restaurants and a mini-market, but everything closed super early – so just be aware that you’ll have to plan your meals carefully.  Other than that, we were able to get around pretty easily and drove almost 750 miles during the course of our stay - we didn't go into Dublin proper - we simply explored the small towns and villages.",3,2015,10,11
217,Stunning location,An excellent hotel. Great location. The service is impeccable as are the facilities. In all the perfect hotel for a romantic weekend away. If possible try to reserve a room to the front of the hotel to get the stunning views.,5,2015,10,10
217,Luxurious spa and golf hotel,"I stayed one night before a golf day and thoroughly enjoyed my relaxing stay. Had a quick visit to the pub which served bar food late at night. I expected a more relaxing cocktail lounge than a pub with wooden decor for this hotel, but it had a nice atmosphere and the staff were excellent. Very pricey drinks though. The bedroom was huge, with an entrance hall, dressing room and a large bathroom which had twin sinks, a large, deep bath and separate shower. The bathroom even had a tv in the mirror which was a cool touch and there were loads of towels supplied. The bed was super king and very comfortable and robes and slippers were provided. The rooms were very well sound proofed as I heard no door banging in the morning! I had a view of the garden but I didn't get time to look at it. The superb breakfast was buffet and everything you could wish for. The spa was very quiet and I had the pool to myself. Children are only allowed to swim at certain times. The hotel's close proximity to the golf club was very convenient.",5,2015,10,09
217,A real five star venue and experience!,"It is obvious from the moment you arrive in Powerscourt Hotel that it was designed and built as a five star venue, the quality of the décor and furnishing indicate that it has been maintained to that standard since reopening in 2013.

The staff are obviously trained to a five star level and are obvious in numbers but in no way intrusive. The spa is wonderful and has the added benefit of child free times during the day and in the evening. The grounds of the Powerscourt house provide pleasant surroundings and the river walk is a must for a tranquil way to spend an hour. 

If available, I highly recommend going for one of the suites as the incremental cost is far outweighed by the enhanced experience. There is a choice of bars and restaurants on site with a good variety of places to eat and drink in the local Enniskerry village.

This hotel is within easy reach of the center Dublin, but is a world away. If you have something special to celebrate, this is the place to go!",5,2015,10,09
217,"Beautiful hotel, service lacking.","Beautiful hotel.  Stunning views.  Rooms are really gorgeous.  Beds are so comfortable.  Can't fault rooms or public areas at all.  
We had dinner in the bar.  It was ok, no greater than other 3* hotels we have stayed or dined in.  Same as breakfast.  Special requests not listened to.
Check in was completely impersonal.  Felt like we were intruding on their time.  Sounded like they had set responses and rattled off whatever line came to mind first.  Similarly the same rehearsed lines throttled out at the spa regardless of whether they were suitable to the conversation. 
Rooms were not provided as booked. Twin rooms booked, doubles given. Difficulties with the menu for the group.  Slow service in the bar.

Fabulous hotel but really lacking in the welcome factor.  Hotel was awarded hotel of the year the night before, perhaps it had gone to their head!",3,2015,10,09
217,Excellent in every way!,"Stayed here for a night in June as a surprise gift for my girlfriends birthday. On arrival we went straight to the Sugarloaf Lounge for lunch before check-in. We also had drinks in the lounge that night and breakfast the next morning all of which were fantastic. Staff were great, friendly and always professional. The only thing that could beat the beauty of the gardens and grounds of this estate was our master suite, it's decor and the view from our balcony, simply amazing. Would stay here again in a heartbeat 10/10",5,2015,10,08
217,Disappointing for a special occasion. ,"Having booked a stay at this establishment as a surprise trip for a special occasion for Mrs Limerick Couple I can safely say that we will not be returning nor recommending it to our family, friends or acquaintances. 

A stay in a ""standard"" room was booked along with an evening meal. The accommodation lives up to all the other positive reviews for the ""standard"" accommodation. 

I had specifically spoken with reservations regarding an evening meal for the special occasion which our two young and well behaved children would be accompanying us. I was assured that ""The Sugar Loaf Restaurant"" would offer us a wonderful dining experience. 

Arriving at our booked time for our dining experience I was crest fallen to see the expression on the face of Mrs Limerick Couple. She tried very, very hard to hide her disappointment when she seen the venue.

We don't post all our travel destinations and experiences on Trip Advisor but lets just say that this isn't our first 5* venue...

What had been described to me as a restaurant turned out to be the Sugar Loaf Lounge. Hardly a setting for a special meal. The venue was so disappointing that beimg perfectly honest I cannot remember the meal itself. I am still horrified that I was advised that this would be the perfect setting for a very special occasion. 

On checking out I brought up my disappointment and was shocked to be informed ""you were on a package"". To this day it has not been explained to me what this meant. I booked directly over the telephone with the hotel because of the importance of the occasion. 

Following up with a written complaint to hotel management I was offered the option to purchase some vouchers for a reduced price stay at the hotel and was informed that we could dine at the Sika restaurant this time.

Needless to say I did not follow up on this suggestion as I feel a 5* establishment should get things right from the first moment of contact. Never before have I been so ill advised and I will not forget the look of disappointment in my wife's eyes.... I feel that the poor advice I was given was as a direct consequence of travelling with our two young children. The next 5* venue for our family will be beyter researched before parying with my hard earned cash.  Powerscourt didn't deserve my business. ",2,2015,10,05
217,Just Perfect!,"I stayed here for a few days with my son, as a pamper experience for me following a serious illness. It was absolutely perfect. I can't fault a thing but adored my breakfast every morning. The location too is perfect for travelling to some of the area's natural beauty spots and we even managed to hike slowly up the Sugar Loaf. I can't wait to go back next year :)",5,2015,10,04
217,Luxurious Hotel in the midst of magnificent gardens,"This beautiful hotel is located on the Powerscourt Estate in the midst of magnificent gardens of various types such as the very lovely Japanese Garden. Do not miss a walk through these gorgeous grounds.

The hotel was very comfortable with a coffee maker in the room as well as a refrigerator and snacks and drinks for purchase. The room was actually a  suite that was quite spacious with plenty of room for relaxation. Breakfast was included and the buffet was quite sumptuous with a large variety of food. The service was attentive and every request was carried out quickly and with care.",5,2015,10,01
217,Fav Hotel in Ireland!,"This resort is one of the best for location, scenery and customer service. Amazing views of Sugar Loaf Mountain from your room, dining area & walking paths.  We have stayed here twice and all of the staff is always spectacular!  Jozeph, in the restaurant is great. He understands how to take care of the guests. When he found out we were celebrating our anniversary he gave us two glasses of Champagne at dinner. He also personally delivered a lovely Happy Anniversary plate with the message written in chocolate surrounded by little bite sized chocolates. What a special treat!",5,2015,09,30
217,Gorgeous hotel with equally stunning surrounds,"Great five star hotel with everything you'd expect. 
Staff are friendly and professional. 
Breakfast was one of the best I've had at a hotel.
Had an amazing dinner where the service was exceptional. We asked the waiter to delay courses as wanted a long dinner and he couldn't have been more accommodating.
Booked a large room which was essentially a suite. Loved the spaciousness and luxurious bed.",5,2015,09,30
217,Majestic,"i stayed at this hotel due to attending a wedding.
from the moment of arrival i was on cloud9.
attention to detail and the surroundings are the two features that most impressed.
Breakfeast was in the irish tradition and covered every ingredient imaginable,,excellent.
due to the wedding i did not eat in the restaurant but was told by fellow guests thst it was wonderful.
The setting for the wedding was in the gardens with the meal in one of the vintage function rooms,,what a setting with Irelands most famous landscaped gardens

217,Beautiful Get-away,"Stunning hotel, luxurious accommodations, beautiful garden grounds and art throughout. Tv in your bathroom mirror, comfortable bed and linens, friendly staff. prices seemed reasonable to high if you choose to eat in. We went into the little town nearby and at at Emilia's Italian restaurant and it was a delight. The hotel was included in our tour and was a great way to end our visit to Ireland.",5,2015,09,28
217,We did not want to leave,"If you get a chance to visit the Powerscourt Hotel, take it!!  It is a beautiful hotel located next to the Powerscourt Estate and you will feel like the Lord of the Manor as a guest.  We were greeted as we pulled into the driveway. Our bags and car were promptly manned and as we were escorted to a phenomenally large suite, we were given pertinent information to make our stay enjoyable. The room was ridiculously large and well decorated -- complete with deer outside our window.  The bedding absolutely consumed your body. Perhaps the most lavish bedding we've experienced in a hotel setting.  Dinner at Sika was a fine dining experience to be remembered.  Words don't exist to adequately describe the complex and subtle combinations that made each course a unique and fascinating experience.  And the service enhanced every aspect of the dinner.  We stayed until the last possible minute and left knowing that the bar was insanely high for future accommodations.",5,2015,09,28
217,One night is not enough.,Powerscourt Hotel is one of the nicest hotels I have every stayed in.  It was our first night in Dublin and we were going to do a self driving tour down the South East coast.  One night in Powerscourt is not enough.  They offer so many amenities you cannot take advantage of all of them.,5,2015,09,28
217,Wonderful visit,"Well, today is our last day here.   What a wonderful time we have had.  The hotel is wonderful.  Spa fantastic.   We did the chefs table in the kitchen the first night.   Great start to a great visit.
Food was phenomenal.   
We visited each restaurant and can't say enough about each of them.
My mother and sister joined us for three days and the hotel arranged a chauffeur to pick them up in Dublin.   He too was wonderful.
Brian was very helpful.   
All of the staff were friendly and helpful.
Before this visit we were at the k club for two days and were planning to return, but decided to stay here.
We had a suite with kitchen, living area and two bathrooms.
I would go back!

217,"Beautiful property,  lovely suite. Should deserve 5 stars, but poor treatment for prepaid breakfast","Booked as part of package at 5 star properties.  We paid an additional $200 to have a suite at Powerscourt and full breakfasts each day of our 8 day trip.
We knew we would leave at 4 am for an early morning flight, so would not be able to have the 28 euro breakfast each that had been prepaid on our last day.
We contacted the hotel and asked that we be allowed to substitute a lunch or sandwiches to take with us in lieu of breakfast and were told absolutely not as the meal was part of a package!
Not our problem how much or little was reimbursed to the hotel for this meal by the tour and we spoke with several managers once we arrived to no avail and thus were given 2 bananas, an apple and tepid coffee to go for the 58 euro credit for our breakfast.
Too bad, as the suite was lovely and several people did try to help, but not what we hoped for and a disappointment.",4,2015,09,26
217,Stunning hotel,"We stayed at the Powerscourt the last night of our 2 week vacation. The suite was large and comfortable and very modern. We had a beautiful view of the mountains and trees through the large windows.

Late lunch in the Sugar Loaf lounge was good; we loved looking out over the mountains. And then we enjoyed dinner at Sika.

The service was impeccable from every person at the hotel. We look forward to staying here again on our next trip.",5,2015,09,26
217,Great setting Shame about a few things,"This was our 2nd time here and it is a lovely place of grandeur and feels very upmarket we do love it and will go back but a few points let it down this visit. sadly on getting our room my wife noticed the pillows where stained and the headboard had alot of dust etc in through the carvings, we paid the extra 28euros EACH!! for the breakfast 1 morning and we were very disappointed, last year was so much better, the whole breakfast service was a shambles and for that price you get what you get included in many other hotels with less stars to their name, the room service meals where of the same standard, over cooked and lifeless but very expensive...",4,2015,09,24
217,Pure Excellence,"We stayed in Powerscourt for a family 80th birthday celebration weekend. There were 19 of us ranging from ages 1 to 80.

217,Stunning place,Powerscourt must enjoy some of the best mountain views anywhere in the world.  The hotel looks out over the Wicklow Mountains near the delightful village of Enniskerry.  It has a very good indoor pool and spa area with all amenities.  Staff are helpful and friendly.,4,2015,09,21
217,Just don't go for lunch!,"We had our first, eagerly anticipated visit to the Powerscourt Hotel on Saturday.  We drove down to have lunch as a bit of a treat and something different.  Without being overly picky, I was extremely surprised and disappointed with our experience there.

I was surprised when my red wine was served in a 'white' wine glass.  Fearing my ignorance I said to the waitress, is that not a white wine glass?  Oh yes she replied, but we serve all our wines in these!  Que?????  She did go and get me a different and more suitable glass for the truly delicious wine that was served at a perfect temperature. Oh, also, she had the strangest pronounciation of the name Rioja.. again, this being a 5* establishment, I thought I might have been missing something...

Husband ordered a gin and tonic which came in a brandy glass???  I don't get the glasses thing at all.  Maybe I'm not hip or 5*!!

Husband ordered a pulled pork sandwich which he said was ok, very mediocre, nothing exciting.  I opted firstly for the crab salad at 16e.  What arrived was this tiny circular thing, topped with a few lettuce leaves... humm... I thought, wouldn't fill a mouse.  I changed it for the caesar salad.  This came looking to be a more normal size, but it was just awful.  Not to hang about with the details, it was just limp and tasteless.  Didn't much like the whole anchovies either.  Only for the bread, I would have left completely starving.  I had asked at the beginning as well, for a slice of garlic bread.  Nope, couldn't do that.  

They were awfully nice when they noticed I hadn't eaten much of it and in fairness took it off the bill.  I said the crab looked like a starter; it was they said, on the starter side of the menu, but the caesar salad was just two items down??  Very weird.

They were very nice about the whole thing, but you know, wouldn't you rather have something nice to eat and pay for it happily!  So, I'm just saying, if you're going for lunch, be aware.  It's not 5*.",2,2015,09,20
217,Fantastic Hotel,"An absolute pleasure to stay in Powerscourt. From the moment we arrived it was a great experience.
Staff excellent, food Excellent, atmosphere & facilities again excellent. 
Looking forward to staying again soon.",5,2015,09,17
217,"Beautiful location, Terrible service, not a 5 Star hotel!!","Beautiful location, appears to be 5 star, but shabby room, burnt food and terrible service is not acceptable.

We took 3 kids for 2 nights and booked a 1 bedroomed suite.  

The room was OK, wooden floor was badly scratched and the TV in the bathroom couldn't be turned off.  There were no towels or robes & slippers for the kids.  The extra bed was delivered with no quilt cover and when when we rang to ask for it, we were sent a scratchy blanket and expected to dress the bed ourselves.  We eventually got a quilt delivered.  

Breakfast is a buffet, nothing is cooked fresh and it is standard to that of a 3 star.  Staff are young and inexperienced.
We took the kids to the pool the next day, they are only allowed swim at certain times and at 12 noon a member of staff turned on all the lights in the pool area and rudely told everyone with kids to get out.
We ordered room service that night, restaurant was full, and I don't bring kids to a bar.  Food was expensive for what you got, ordered hake on a bed of mash with veg for kids and got battered cod & chips sent up instead, my son's burger was so badly burnt, it crunched when he took a bite, had to order a fresh one.  THERE IS NO EXCUSE FOR SENDING FOOD OUT BURNT FROM A SO CALLED 5 STAR HOTEL!!  The chef is not blind to what he has just cooked, this just says it all about the lack of interest or care from the staff.

At checkout I brought my concerns to the receptionist, in fact I even wrote them down, and I was assured he would bring them to management and they would contact me, that was 4 weeks ago.  I think in future we will stick to our 5 star hotel in Cork, they know how to take care of you.  Powerscourt, your management need training and so do your staff.",1,2015,09,17
217,Stunning.,"My wife and I stayed in the Powerscourt hotel for a two night break in late August '15. We are both turning 40 this year so decided to do something special and we hoped Powerscourt hotel would be a fitting location to celebrate.  We were not disappointed.  I can honestly say that I have never stay in a nicer and more hospitable hotel.

The staff are a credit to the hotel, from cleaning staff to lobby staff.  I have to say that I found the staff to be the friendliest I have ever encountered.  On check in, we were upgrade to the sixth floor and stayed in room 614, which was beyond my already high expectations.  We had a meal in McGill's on both evenings.  The food was beautiful and once again, the staff could not have been more friendly or helpful.  We both also had a treatment in the Espa, which really topped off a wonderful stay.  If you are looking for a quiet, relaxing break, and feel you need a bit of pampering, I doubt you'll find a nicer hotel in a wonderful location.

217,Great hotel with few exceptions,"Very nice hotel. One of the best facilities we have ever stayed at. Excellent pool and spa, restaurants and pubs on sight. Lovely grounds and spacious rooms and baths. Nice beds and very clean. We had issues with our a/c that was never resolved and one day they made our beds with no sheets or pillow cases and housekeeping had to come at 10pm to rectify. The pub and bar are nice but drinks are very expensive. Breakfast was great each day but the only meal we are on site. Would stay again. Would be 5 stars had it not been for the issues mentioned. ",4,2015,09,16
217,Nice stay but far away,Nice big suites with old fashioned accommodation.  However building exhaust blowing in the parking lot smelled like fish and was ~ 45 mins from Dublin city. Two restaurants on the premises were very good.  Nice Italian restaurant near by was very good and lovely service to drop us there and back to the hotel was also very much appreciated by U.S. (3 couples in our group of American tourists). ,3,2015,09,15
217,Nice Property,This is a beautiful hotel located in the countryside very near a golf course very small village of Enniskerry.  Our room was among the nicest  we have had.  Service at breakfast was sketchy and very limited staff at the  reception. The Bellman were great they drove us to PowersCourt gardens and to the village in the evening for dinner.  And picked us up of course. Very difficult to call the front desk or Concierge and have them answer your phone.  Not enough staff.,4,2015,09,15
217,Stunning Hotel - Taken care of by warm and welcoming Irish staff.,"We stayed four days at this beautiful Hotel. Nestled within acres of forestry it is a tranquil escape from the hustle and bustle of life. We took a five minute walk to Powerscourt House and enjoyed a beautiful day walking through the grounds, Views of the Sugar loaf mountain and beautiful landscaping with lakes and wildlife added greatly to our stay. The hotel has a french feel to the interior with double full length doors to the beautiful bathroom and full length windows overlooking the gardens. We had a beautiful meal in the restaurant with chefs specials between courses. The food was amazing. For a more relaxed atmosphere we had farmhouse fare in the Irish themed lounge on the lower floor. Afternoon tea is served in the beautiful foyer with a tantalising array of pastries and cakes. We had a day at the spa where we were treated to a Swedish massage, some lovely extra touches such as choosing my own scented oil ensured a truly lovely experience. The pool is dimly lit with candles on tables around the pool and loungers to relax on, a tranquil atmosphere. The staff were just as you would hope for, in an Irish hotel. that lovely friendliness and relaxed approach is refreshing. The reception staff combine efficiency with relaxed charm. I have absolutely no complaints about this hotel. It is not cheap, it is expensive but you get what you pay for and for a special occasion it is worth the expense.",5,2015,09,14
217,Dublin countryside at its best,"Fantastic room, magnificent view, excellent service. The Powerscourt hotel stands in a luxury golf resort. It's all green just like Ireland itself. You can walk to a small village (Enniskerry) and drink a Guinness at these typical Irish pubs.",5,2015,09,14
217,Simple perfection,"My parents stayed here for a weekend recently and I visited twice for lunch and also hung out for an afternoon in their suite. 

The hotel itself is just breathtaking. It feels luxurious and elegant but quietly so. The staff are just amazing. So professional - but friendly, warm and welcoming. Lunch on both days was lovely. The food was delicious and I especially loved their little desserts - to die for. The staff were so helpful and efficient but we were able to relax over our food without being rushed. It was a lovely experience. 

My parents suite was very comfortable. The view was sublime. I was particularly taken with the tv in the bathroom mirror and this is my new life goal!!!!! 

Overall, I will definitely visit again. I am already planning to go for afternoon tea!",5,2015,09,13
217,Anniversary ,"Had an amazing experience at the powerscourt 
The staff were so helpful right from check in

You have so much to see and do around the surrounding areas of the hotel for all your family ",5,2015,09,13
217,Luxury!,"This hotel is amazing and the rooms were large and well appointed. The pub on premises was fun and the food much better than I had anticipated. Don't forget to check out the waterfall!

The spa is excellent, and had a wonderful massage by Daniel and a facial.
Breakfast was the icing on the cake - Sunday brunch fabulous!",4,2015,09,12
217,Exceeded our expectations.Absolutely Wonderful!,"We paid a little extra money for our 1st ""overseas trip"" to Ireland and decided to go with a 5 Star hotel/Powerscourt. (We normally would book at 3 or 4 star. It was worth every penny. We booked the cheapest room available. When we arrived we were surprised at the size of the room (no cheap rooms here) it was beautiful. The view was amazing. The staff was excellent in every way. Tip-add the breakfast buffet to your room. $20.00 extra per day for the room but well worth it. We hope to return to Ireland and we will definitely stay here again.",5,2015,09,10
217,A very special hotel and location,"Stayed in Powerscourt Hotel for 2 nights and wow what an experience. The location is stunning, service is 6******Star and wonderful rooms and facilities. It is some of the best hospitality I have ever experienced in Ireland.
This is an amazing hotel and there is so much to do in and around the hotel. 2 great golf courses, stately house, stunning gardens and the most beautiful waterfall. Then the hotel itself offers true luxury. Sika restaurant is again a must visit with a great menu showcasing local and Irish produce in a very creative style. Excellent service and also very professional yet relaxed feel.

Overall a must visit hotel and resort but stay for at least 2 nights if not more.",5,2015,09,10
217,Family get together,Hotel surroundings very impressive.  Staff very attentive and friendly.  Rooms absolutely beautiful and our family got two upgrades.  We ate in McGills bar on the first night and it was very tasty and staff again could not have been nicer.,4,2015,09,09
217,Awesome!,"We went to Ireland for two weeks for our 40th anniversary. We stayed at the Marriott Powerscourt for the first week. The hotel is magnificent. It is located adjacent to the Powerscourt estate, which is situated just above the little town of Enniskerry, which is located just south of Dublin.

They are a full service resort. They have a top end spa and pool, 2 1/2 restaurants, one of which is pub style, two bars, one of which is in the pub, the other is an upscale second floor bar at which they serve food at certain times.

The lobby is of grand style with a stunning marble staircase going downstairs, two fireplaces, large comfortable sofas and chairs etc and the lobby bar with beautiful views of the countryside/mountains.

The layout of the property is very unusual and difficult to describe, but the lobby is on the second floor, which is ground level on the front and second story from the back of the resort, so there are rooms, the spa, restaurants and banquet/conference rooms on the first floor, which you go down to from the lobby. There is also a large beautiful open air sunken garden in the center at the front of the property, which is accessed off the first floor banquet hall area and in which they have a lot of weddings. The building is ""U"" shaped and the back has a large grass area with large fountain in the center. In the center front is the sunken garden I mentioned and to either side of that is parking, one side being a parking lot, the other side a parking garage. 

The service (other than the restaurant) was wonderful and the staff couldn't be more friendly or helpful. The only real criticism I have is of the concierge. The position requires sound firsthand knowledge of the area, area activities and restaurants. We found that the concierges knew very little about anything. All the position seems to be is a facilitator. You want reservations made, he'll do it, you want a limo, he'll arrange it, but need insightful directions or recommendations, forget it. Every upscale hotel/resort I've ever been to has had concierges who could give you details on just about anything in a respectable geographical area of the hotel and would have pre-printed easy to follow directions with commentary to the more common places that guests tend to go. Or give you directions with helpful verbal route commentary on how to get to something. Not here. They have to search for most everything on google and google maps and then print out basic info or maps, which I could do myself. I'm looking for the ""inside"" scoop on places, how to get there, what to really expect, etc.

The rooms are incredible! Our room had 1 1/2 all marble bathrooms, fully furnished living room, bedroom with two large pockets doors separating it from the living room, a separate room/area of closets and storage, and a dry bar area with assorted glasses and stocked (expensive)mini fridge. The master bath was huge with water closet, shower with rain shower-head, Jacuzzi tube, double vanity and a mirror with a TV incorporated into it. I've never seen this technology before, but the tv was part of the mirror, not built into it, but actually part of the glass mirror, with the speaker mounted in the overhead chandelier. It was awesome. The half bath was off the entrance hallway and had separate water closet and vanity areas. Both the living room and bedroom had large glass windows which overlooked the large grass area and fountain out back. There were ample towels and washcloths. I mention washcloths because most hotels and B&B's in Ireland do not have wash cloths. There were also robes and slippers to use if you want to and to wear to the spa and pool if you change into your suit in your room. The bed, the most important part of a hotel, was a king size, was excellent, soft, but supportive. A number of amenities, including beds, in Europe are substantially different from the US, but most everything here was as in the US. One exception is sheeting. There is no top sheet on the bed, instead they use a duvet made out of sheeting material as the top sheet and comforter duvet. This we found to be common in Ireland. The one area all Marriott brands lack in, is the pillows. They're cheap, thin, non-supportive pillows, as was the case here.

The main restaurant offers breakfast buffet everyday and dinner nightly, the pub has pub grub and the lobby bar offers food at certain times and deserts with your drinks. The main restaurants food is good, nothing to write home about, but good. They should improve on it given the level of the resort. Their greatest downfall is service. The service in the restaurant is slow, disorganized and very inattentive. It was apparent from their interactions this was seasoned staff, but their service was as if it was their first day and they had received 10 min of training before being thrown out onto the floor. Some of the poorest service I've ever seen or experienced at a resort/hotel restaurant of this caliber. This held true for breakfast as well. Just really poor, disorganized, inattentive service. I also recognized some of the staff at breakfast as the same the prior evenings. And it was also obvious that they crawled out of bed, threw on their clothes and dashed into work. Their appearance was all disheveled and hair all over the place. The mediocre food and poor service was the reason I didn't give the hotel a 5 circle excellent rating.  The pub grub is what you'd expect, basic, good tasting food. 

All in all, this is an excellent place to stay and I'd highly recommend it to anyone. The pricing is not that much above many other places, many of which were not the caliber of Powerscourt.",4,2015,09,09
217,Luxury and elegance,Thank you for an amazing stay - one we wont forget and hope to visit when we return to Ireland.  A piece of paradise tucked away in a beautiful setting. Our room was beautifully appointed and staff were very obliging. ,5,2015,09,07
217,Wonderfull Hotel Lovely Setting,"We have recently had a two night stay at this very nice hotel, we had a suite which is one of the best we have had. Plenty of gadgets including a TV in the mirror of the bathroom, every comfort is taken care of in the room. The remainder of the hotel is very luxurious, the gardens are fantastic and with different walks all in the local area this hotel comes highly recommended. I do hope that sooner rather than later I will be able to return.",5,2015,09,04
217,Beautiful but a bit disappointing,"This hotel is beautiful and peaceful. Perfect for couples without children. The spa and pool are lovely, but it's a shame none of he lockers worked and half the numbers to tap in your code were broken.

We had a spacious room with separate living area and wardrobe area. All furnished tastefully in a traditional style. Never got any bottles of complimentary water that was advertised though.

We made the mistake of not fully reading the website as the initial pages successfully misled us into thinking we would be able to walk around the award winning gardens and waterfall, when actually you have to pay extra for both and the waterfall is a 10-15 minute drive away.

Breakfast service was a bit hit and miss. A couple of mornings the staff looked like stroppy teenagers who'd been told to clean their bedroom. Didn't get offered tea or toast and ate surrounded by dirty plates. At one point I thought I'd have to do the washing up myself. On the weekend though it appeared to be different staff who were wonderful, friendly, helpful, completely different atmosphere. Judit and Magdalena especially.

It's probably best not to bring children to this hotel. Night 1 we dined in McGills and asked for a little milk (couple of ounces) for our 1 year old baby only to be charged €1.50 which seemed a bit mean. 

I really don't think they should advertise having a games room for children as we were directed out a fire escape, down a steep flight of steps (no lift so not buggy friendly) and then found the games room. It looked like it hadn't been cleaned for months, the ceiling was mouldy and there were wires hanging out of the wall. Needless to say we didn't stay long and lugged the pram and baby back up stairs. Let's down the rest of the hotel.",3,2015,09,04
217,Bad end to an amazing anniversary wkd,"Stayed here with my hubby and 6 month old and everything was fab from check in experience, lovely upgrade, friendly staff, baby friendly hotel and room. Breakfast was lovely each morning and they couldn't do enough for us. When I checked out I floated out as was so refreshed and happy after our break, to my utter dismay and horror, someone had badly damaged my car and after a long process of dealing with staff here, nothing was done as the cameras that were pointed at the car park were inadequate to make out car reg details of other car. For someone to do this is a separate matter and I was never able to speak the general manager despite several requests by me. I was left with a very large unexpected bill following our wkd break. I really was v disappointed and upset at my treatment by staff when dealing with my complaint as it took several weeks of chasing up as calls were not being returned to me on several occasions. I still can't understand why in a 5 star hotel cameras are not clear and a person cannot speak to the general manager.",3,2015,09,04
217,Elegance Beyond Compare,"Every aspect of our stay at the Powerscourt Hotel was nearly perfect. We stumbled upon this property nearly by accident and immediately regretted only allowing one day in our trip to be at this property. Each room seems to be unique, yet none inferior to the other. We first saw the back gardens by night and I felt like I was in a Harry Potter book. The grounds stretch for acres, broken up by small forests, but leaving it open enough. I unwisely left discovering the pool, steam room, and spa to the very end. I rarely feel the need to swim at hotels, but wow! Next it will be high on my list. Overall, what began as a transit hotel has become a destination for our next trip. Go discover it for yourselves!",5,2015,09,03
217,Birthday present,Fantastic hotel fabulous suite lovely quaint village good restaurants in village. We had dinner in hotel and really enjoyed with a lovely view so all in all had a great time. Lots of scenic places to visit around.,5,2015,09,02
217,One of the best hotels I've stayed in,"All around fantastic.  Rooms are beautiful with great views.  Beds are among the most comfortable I ever slept in.  Service is perfect.  Even the mini-bar is reasonably priced.  It is also an incredibly building and you feel like royalty as you walk in.  Just perfect, nothing could be better.",5,2015,09,02
217,Fabulous!,"Stayed here with a friend. Room was stunning. Spa was lovely as always. Dinner was a real surprise, delicious and our waiter was very attentive. Staff on check in were a little preoccupied with negatively discussing another member of staff who was lunching too late and to be honest some appearances were a little dishevelled! One lady in particular appeared quite grumpy, with a false cheer for us- not what you would expect in a five star hotel front desk attendant! Likewise when we askedto have a table outside for breakfast, there was a little sigh from  the girl. But overall a great ecperience and we will return. Expensive but worth it for a treat- delicious mango martini in the sugarloaf cafe too.",4,2015,09,02

217,"Opulence, elegance and service at its best even for a five star hotel. it is better than most.","From the moment we pulled up, someone was available to help with our luggage and the check in process was seamless.We were shown to the most beautiful suite that quite honestly took our breath away. The staff took time to show us around the room and to show us how everything worked. The suite is so well appointed with everything you could possibly need, plenty of bottled water, terrific water pressure, which can sometimes be an issue, lots of shampoos and conditioners and heaps of fluffy towels. They don't skimp on anything. All the staff went out of their way to greet, assist and help in any way they could. The hotel is closely located to the beautiful Powerscourt Gardens, very worth visiting.
We enjoyed an evening at McGills Bar and the service and food were great. It has a terrific atmosphere and no one seemed to mind my appalling rendition of 40 Shades of Green. The memory of the exceptional service is lasting in your mind. the Staff in the Breakfast area are just wonderful. Nothing is too much trouble and they constantly seek to improve your experience even to offering to parcel up some pastry's for you to take away should you want them.  The check out was quick and efficient and every assistance was given to getting our luggage down and out to our cars. I would stay here again in a heartbeat. This hotel is well located to enjoy the delightful Enniskerry and the Wiklow National Park with a quick trip down to Glendalough.",5,2015,09,01
217,A weekend in heaven,"Four of us have just returned from a 3 night stay at the fabulous Powerscourt Resort and Spa and I had to post a review, so good was our experience!
We really enjoyed the chefs table on the Friday night at the Sika Restaurant with Chef Peter Byrne. An experience I would recommend to anyone. Peter is not only a great cook but he happily shares his knowledge and is a pleasure to meet.
On both days the men played golf, first day East Course and second day the West Course. Both courses were a great test of golf and the views are stunning.
The ladies proclaimed the spa treatments some of the best ever had and the whole facilities and setting were a total joy. The location is also great for exploring and the whole experience will be one to relish for some time.",5,2015,09,01
217,Almost excellent,"This is a very good hotel. The scenery is breathtaking, the service in the hotel good, the quality of the food and wine very high (the afternoon tea is truly amazing!) , the spa top notch, swimming pool very good and all in all a great option for a long weekend.
We had a wonderful time at the hotel and would thoroughly recommend it for anyone looking for a weekend away. We would also suggest visiting the next door gardens.
Our only significant let down was with the reception area, firstly they wrote before our arrival offering to help make dinner reservations but when we said yes for the first night told us that they nothing in the restaurant between 6pm and 8.30 pm which was not good and then the queue at checkout was more like a budget b&b than a five star resort. 
My advice is to phone through to the restaurant a good few weeks in advance, especially as it is worth going to the main restaurant (which we did on our second night) as the food was very good. As for checking out, download the Marriott app on your phone so you can avoid the mayhem at the reception desk.
Don’t let the reception performance put you off staying at what is a very good hotel and one we might well return to.",4,2015,09,01
217,Soothing Location,"Spent a night here last week (mid week). We had dinner in the restaurant and used the Spa facilities. Hotel is beautifully situated and nicely decorated in a classic style. Room was very spacious & comfortable. Dinner was excellent in the dining room, but if going again I would eat slightly later as there were a few families with young children around. Staff were most attentive & helpful. Surroundings are stunning.",4,2015,09,01
217,Wonderful Stay,"We stayed at the hotel for one night but arrived early in the day so we had some time to appreciate this wonderful hotel.  The rooms were huge and beautiful !  Bathrooms were just delightful with the television in the mirror and so spacious.  The staff was wonderful, talkative and gave us some great advise.  The food was good but we only had breakfast.
We had the pleasure of watching the falconry and it was a thrill.  We enjoyed every moment and walking the grounds was a rare treat.  Not one complaint.",5,2015,08,31
217,Stunning hotel blessed by its location,"My wife took me for a break away to the Powerscourt Hotel for my birthday in June. The hotel is in a stunning location, the Powerscourts gardens are right beside it & the Powerscourt waterfall is near by.If you like scenic locations then this one if right up there. 
The hotel itself is relatively new and is in fantastic condition. When you drive in you find you're actually at the back of the hotel. The front is access through the lobby and out the other side. The means that the ""front"" has un-obscured views of the country side and the Sugar loaf mountain and its crescent shape give all rooms a view.  
There's roughly 200 rooms in the hotel and most of them are suites. Our suite was nothing short of fabulous. On my travels around Ireland I'd say it was within the top 3 of the suites I've stayed in. 
I had dinner and afternoon tea in the sugar loaf lounge and thoroughly enjoyed the food quality and service. There is an Irish Pub down stairs and for foreign guests I can assure its a genuine traditional Irish pub so enjoy the experience. 
The pool and spa were used and exactly as you would expect in a superior 5 star so I can't fault it any way.
I'll be honest, the Powerscourt Hotel in my opinion is one of the very best that Ireland has to offer. I would have zero qualms in recommending this to anyone.",5,2015,08,31
217,Slack poor service,"I felt compelled to write this review of much loved hotel I have stayed in several times before. Seeing that this hotel is in an area of outstanding natural beauty and that I only live around the corner I frequently visit for lunch or just the odd drink. 
I must say that this is pretty hard, for I love this hotel and have great memories staying there. The sad fact is that the hotel is going backward by the second. The service and attention to detail is lacking. I want to single out the staff in the foyer bar and lounge area. They are unfriendly, slow, rude at times and makes a visit to this once fine establishment a very unpleasant experience. The place looks a mess, tables are never cleared in good time and orders are wrong all of the time. I visited only hours ago and left even before sitting down for the whole place was just a heap of chaos. Sadly, I will be going elsewhere from now on. Sad, but true.  ",2,2015,08,30
217,Stunningly amazing location and hotel,"We stayed here for 2 nights after a Tough Mudder event and were blown away with this incredible hotel. The drive/entrance was stunning and set our expectation of the hotel even higher, we weren't disappointed when we arrived at the hotel. We stayed in a mountain view suite which had its own lounge, kitchen, WC, walk in dressing room, bedroom and amazing bathroom that was to die for!! The views from the huge double balcony were incredible!! The service provided by all staff members was second to none, even supplying a roll of cling film to cover a cut/stitches obtained from the Tough mudder to keep it dry in the spa!! The spa was incredible, so relaxing with plenty of room to  unwind, there was also an endless supply of fresh towels. The food at the piano bar was excellent as was the room service, the piano bar has a set cocktail list but the bar staff were more than happy to deviate from this list and make us our favourite cocktails.
Highly impressed with the hotel, the staff, the views, the facilities, the room, could not find a single fault during our 2 night stay. Incredible value for money and could not recommend staying here enough, we would love to come back!!",5,2015,08,30
217,Lovely hotel receptionist rude on checking out.,"I have to start by saying this hotel is fab the room was beautiful the food is excellent the surroundings are beautiful and the staff for the most are pleasant and friendly.  Upon checking in I had given a gift voucher to our receptionist to out towards our stay a birthday gift to the value of 250.00 Euro to which he informed me would be taken off the overall bill.  Upon checking out I noticed the voucher had not been reduced off the overall cost of our stay I pointed this out to our receptionist Eimear who was pleasant and professional I asked her to check with her collegue which was the gent we checked in with and he rudely looked over and blatantly said our voucher was not for that amount!! Even though he clearly did not remember nor could they find the voucher.  At this stage I took my phone out to retrieve the email with the voucher value and code on it she took it and we cleared up the remaining bill.

I have to say I find it incredibly rude and insulting to be treated like a liar and he never made a attempt to apologise for his behaviour when he was clearly wrong.  We spent a lot of money on our stay and as a birthday treat we wanted to make the most of our special stay and up to the point we had no complaints but after that what felt like character assassination I was left on a bad note.

217,Short break,"We had a very nice stay at the hotel. The food in mcgills was excellent but menu was limited byt value was very good. We had meal in silka restaurant and while it was a nice meal it was overpriced.  Food very very nice but  a bit over complicated. The signage in the hotel needs to be updated. Because of the rain we parked in the underground car park. There was no signs to the reception.  Similiar story when we were looking for games room. Staff was very nice, only small thing was over the four days we got woken early by th3e staff once by phone and once knocking on the door . Hotel is in a great location. Overall the stay was great but it is definitely overpriced.",4,2015,08,28
217,Beautiful traditional Five Star Hotel,"This is a superb traditional five star hotel.  The setting is wonderful, service excellent and my room was one of the best I have stayed in.  It must have been circa 60-70 square metres - large bathroom separate dressing room with extensive wardrobes large very comfortable bed - it was more like a suite.
Fine dining in the Sika restaurant was also excellent.",5,2015,08,28
217,stayed following a wedding in powerscourt house,"Lovely setting ,but I was disappointed that the residents lounge was not open as
 that was the reason our group stayed ,we were told it would be open until 4 am but it was closed when I checked in shortly after 2am.",3,2015,08,27
217,Anniversary weekend!,"My husband took me here last weekend to celebrate our 'ruby wedding anniversary'.  The hotel is situated in a beautiful setting amid the Powerscourt Estate and first impressions were good.  Our room 615 also at first was impressive, very large and beautifully furnished on the 6th floor overlooking the front of the hotel.  Unfortunately we soon discovered red stains splashed on the door frame inside the room and similar stains on the grouting of one sink and the marble floor near the toilet!  Staff quickly organised for us to move 2 rooms down to 609.  This was cleaner though grouting in the bathroom was in need of cleaning and the shower head was chipped.  There was also a strange smell in this room as if a dog had been staying there?  None the less the bedroom was luxurious with an enormous bed and tastefully decorated.
It was difficult getting a reservation in the restaurant which appears to book up weeks in advance.  The menu in the Sika restaurant we found to be limited for a 5 star hotel and when we dined in Mc Gill's bar it too only served burgers and fish and chips.  The latter my husband ordered only to be served burnt battered fish!  Not what we expected a 5 star establishment to serve.
The hotel is beside beautiful gardens which we visited and close to many other visitor attractions.  Menus could be more exciting and room cleanliness needs to be addressed.",3,2015,08,27
217,"Nice hotel, unprofessional receptionist","Me and my husband booked two rooms for  ourselves and my parents from 21.08.2015 - 22.08.2015. When we arrived to the hotel a receptionist took my debit  card and put on hold 750 usd as a security deposit. She confirmed that tomorrow she will release this sum from the hold and will take 450 euro as a payment for our stay. Next day another receptionist had some problems while she was trying to release  750 usd from the hold. We spent around 20 mins at the reception. Finally she told me that money was  released and a room payment was deducted from this amount. I offered to pay with another card but the receptionist reassured me that everything is fine and I'm not going to have an overdraft. I kept using my card without knowing that I had no money on it for a few days. This morning I checked my account and found around 400 euro as an overdraft and 750 usd security deposit were still on hold. The bank will charge me money for each day I had a negative balance on my card account. I didn't have a clue that I had this problem and I only could deal with it this morning. I'm really disappointed with so unprofessional behavior of the receptionist. 
I contacted a hotel manager and I received an  email  with apologies and my money was finally released this morning. I asked them who will pay for my bank extra charges?  I didn't get any reply. 
It was a nice stay. but be careful with your payments!!",2,2015,08,27
217,Great base for hiking and touring southwestern Ireland,"If you like to be outdoors and yet treat yourself to luxury this is an ideal spot.  Powerscourt gardens and many trails are walking distance.  Robert, the concierge offered expert advice on great hiking areas nearby including Sally Gap and the Bray to Graystones cliff walk.  We enjoyed our 40th anniversary stay combining hiking, touring and a great vegetarian dinner.",5,2015,08,26
217,Very Nice,"Great hotel in good quiet location. Free Parking. Good golf courses.
Big Rooms, nice health club and authenticish Irish Bar.
Very pleasant stay with very attentive staff. 
Connor in the breakfast room deserves special praise, as nothing was too much trouble for him, or any other of the staff to be fair.
Would stay here again.",5,2015,08,26
217,Belated Christmas Present,"My stay was was a belated Christmas gift from my sister. Had only visited this beautiful location briefly on two previous occasions. We received a lovely welcome and to our surprise we had been allocated a corner suite!! Very luxurious,only little irritation was that we were unable to get bedside lamps to work, though didn't contact reception for assistance.
Really did enjoy a relaxing bath.
Breakfast a little disappointing. We always love a cooked breakfast when staying away and we just felt this wasn't up to mark for a five star location, served buffet style and everything lukewarm, eggs most unappealing.
Overall impressive and 'yes we did enjoy our short break'",4,2015,08,25
217,Treat night away,"This was a treat night away and we were suitably impressed with the grand driveway and foyer of hotel. The staff were friendly and we were upgraded to a mountain view room, the view was fantastic.  We loved the pool and spa area felt very chilled afterwards. Dinner in McGills was tasty but expensive. 
We didn't do breakfast as we had heard about Kennedys in Enniskerry village which proved to be delicious",5,2015,08,25
217,Designer item went missing from room and staff very uninterested.,"I have visited this hotel a few times and would have given a higher review only for an upsetting episode of service. I stayed in a suite and left behind a designer top, I am aware I shouldnt have forgotten the top but it was a genuine mistake. On realising this, I immediately phoned the hotel (same day) only to be passed from pillar to post . The staff were more interested in guests physically staying in the hotel, despite the fact that I was a returning customer. The staff I spoke to on the phone were uninterested and bored with my issue and promised that they would phone and update me. A month later I have still not had any contact from them bar phone calls I have made myself. One memebr of staff told me that sometime items do go missing via staff members even though there are security measures to prevent this. I was repeatedly questioned and told that I coulnt have left the item in the room even though I could describe exactly where I left it. No compensation was offered for my item. Very disgusting and disgraceful service for a hotel of this calibre where guests do tend to have designer/ more expensive goods.",2,2015,08,25
217,"Lovely staff, great location but suite was disappointing","Having stayed last summer in a superior room with my family we were most looking forward to our return this summer. We booked the mountain view suite room 538. I have to first mention the staff who are absolutely fantastic. They are well-mannered,attentive and naturally friendly. We were greeted by Robbie on our arrival who is both charming and funny and conversed with both our children and added humour to our check-in! When we arrived at our suite I was firstly impressed but on closer inspection became most disappointed. A wet stained mat in the living area with yellow staining and a very obvious burnt bin mark on the wooden flooring. sofa felt grubby to sit on and smelly.Bathroom quite stained in places, toilet roll holder kept falling apart.Bedroom lumpy old pillows. Definitely a far fetch from what we had experienced the previous year. McGills food good but perhaps extend the children's menu, offer children's portions of old favourites I.e. Bangers & mash. Breakfast was fantastic, a vast array of choice, children enjoyed making their pancakes! overall an enjoyable stay but was somewhat hampered by the disappointing room.",3,2015,08,23
217,Overpriced with medicore food,"Booked a 1 DBB package (€290) and came home feeling ripped off to be honest. On booking I reserved with debit card number... then on check-in I was told that my card would be charged with €140 for the night and be refunded upon checkout! I would not agree to this and they didnt make an issue of it but I was still disgusted to be asked considering they had my card details from initial booking. The hotel is stunning, our room was beautiful  and we loved the pool facilities. I was really looking forward to our meal but was left disappointed. Service was very slow, we were there an hour before our mains arrived - the meal took around 2 hours in total. My starter of mozzarella was particularly poor - I expected much more from a 5* hotel, mains and desserts also below standard that I expected. We asked for a jug of water but a bottle of Ballygowan was brought to the table. I looked around and as there were no jugs on any tables I said nothing but was disgusted to be charged €6 for water. Tea and coffee were not included in our meal (not stated on menu) and we were charged an extortionate €10 for same. Overall stay was ok but I would not eat in the restaurant for dinner again - mediocre food, slow service and ridiculous prices for tea, coffee and water. Breakfast was lovely the next morning. Upon checkout we were charged an extra €10 on top of tea, coffee, water.. when I asked why I was told by the receptionist that dinner was only up to a value of €120 - not stated anywhere either. Lovely hotel but too expensive for quality of food & service... no WOW factor apart from actual building. ",3,2015,08,23
217,Treat night away,"Having been to a concert in dublin on Saturday night decided to extend our break by a night and booked this hotel only an hour before we arrived! Our room was overlooking the carpark area which wasn't the best but not a major issue. Staff, service, food etc was as u would expect. Huge room and bathroom with great beds. Right next door to powerscourt house and enniskerry village wch is a huge bonus. Amazing libation and views. Would definitely recommend and look forward to returning",5,2015,08,23
217,Amazing ,We went to Ireland for a weeding and we stayed here for a couple of the days. It's the most amazing hotel. The bedrooms are huge and luxury and the hotel is inside a park so there's plenty to do during the day. In the end there's still a pub inside the hotel for a great drink!,5,2015,08,22
217,A fantastic couple of nights,"My Wife and I recently stayed at the Powerscourt Hotel, for a two night stay, and found it to be excellent.  The setting is fabulous, the hotel charming and the staff were incredibly friendly and helpful.  If I had to pick something negative it was being left waiting in the bar without any staff acknowledging us or taking an order, but it was very busy at the time and the staff were excellent at all other times.  Overall, it was a very enjoyable stay and I'd have no problem recommending it.",5,2015,08,22
217,Fabulous stay,Everything about this hotel was excellent. In particular the meal in Sika restaurant. I will definitely be back to this hotel. It is ideal for a night away or for a special occassion. The staff were helpful and friendly. The room was extremely large and beautifully decorated.,5,2015,08,21
217,Excellent Hotel ,Stayed here recently with my mother for a birthday treat.  It was just outstanding. We got upgraded to a beautiful room. Food and service top class. A true 5 star!! Spa just beautiful well worth a treat!! ,5,2015,08,19
217,Nice Hotel,"I have stayed in this hotel 3 times now. Twice when it was the Ritz and once last weekend. 

On our last visit I found the staff to be very friendly and helpful. Especially a girl who checked us in and out at reception. The food in McGill's bar was nice too & the hotel for the most part looks beautiful. 

I have only one major complaint about this hotel that would stop me from staying here again. The reason we go there is because the pool area is stunning. It used to be a lovely area to sit and read a book or just hang out but unfortunately it has been seriously let go since our last visit (which must have been about 2 years ago). 

The whole room is cold, there was limescale all over the side of the pool and in the Jacuzzi. The lighting system has changed aswell. The whole bottom of the pool used to be lit up with small lights and it was just an amazing place to spend time. Now it is cold, and hasn't got any of the same atmosphere it used to have. On top of that the steam room was broken and there were wet floor signs everywhere. 

Obviously it is expensive to keep the pool area to the same standard as it was when the Ritz owned it but I really think it is a worthwhile investment for the new owners. Extra staff would be needed to make the pool area nicer & a bit of maintenance on the limescale, light and heat situation and you would have that place back to the way it was in no time at all. 

Hopefully this doesn't come across as moaning because hotel is lovely and the staff were really helpful and nice.",4,2015,08,19
217,Absolutely Beautiful,This hotel is by far one of the nicest hotels I have ever stayed in and I travel a lot.  The rooms were amazing (they upgraded us to a suite since I booked 3 rooms).  The hotel is 5 star in everyway.  The staff fantastic and food wonderful.  You wont be let down.,5,2015,08,18
217,Best hotel stay ever!,"Myself and my husband stayed in this hotel for an anniversary celebration, the staff in the hotel could not have been more welcoming or friendly.  We were upgraded to a suite because they knew it was our anniversary, and there were lovely chocolates and macaroons and a card delivered to our suite. The staff really go above and beyond to make sure your stay is as memorable as possible!  I cannot recommend this hotel highly enough, this is my second stay here and I cannot wait for my third!",5,2015,08,18
217,Superb stay yet again,"This was our third family stay at this hotel and we had an amazing time.We stayed for five nights and were upgraded to a beautiful suite.Our children (5 yrs and 2 yrs) loved the pool,playground and my son loved the playroom (special mention to the two ladies and one man in the room-sorry I can't recall their names)-they were great with my son who loved painting and playing hide & seek with them.As always nothing was too much trouble during our stay-we asked for a bowl of strawberries for our daughter at breakfast as she wasn't eating much and they brought them out every morning much to her delight. On different days we also had lunch in Sugar loaf lounge and dinner in McGills bar and all were meals were very nice. We will definitely be back again - our son has already asked when we're returning!",5,2015,08,17
217,Best hotel I've ever been to ,"What a truly amazing hotel.
I could live here.
Stayed for one night with my wife and daughter and we a had a fantastic time .

Its the staff who have sell the experience to you ,and they did exactly that ,warm friendly staff across the hotel is what we found.

The room was amazing ,it was huge,with a view off the sugar loaf mountain ,and the gardens outside and the pool beside us ,who could ask for more.

My child was so well received across the hotel and there is plenty for kids to do here .

Found the food to be excellent right throughout the hotel 

Thankyou so much ,it was sad to leave .already thinking about are next visit .",5,2015,08,17
217,High tea at three,"Stopped off for tea at this hotel while out for a drive around Wicklow. The hotel formerly known as the ritz Carlton is under the Marriott hotel group now. Staff were ok , grounds lovely , service ok , hotel decor again very nice, overall very good , I suppose worth a visit , lost the glitz of the ritz though ",4,2015,08,16
217,Superb - You have to stay here!,"From the moment you arrive you feel so relaxed and know you will be well looked after. The Mountain View rooms offer spectacular views of the surrounding Wicklow mountains. The staff are fantastic and so helpful. McGills pub is good for a few drinks but the Sugar Loaf Lounge is better for a more relaxed atmosphere.
As for the rooms,  well, the bed was so comfortable and the bathroom simply stunning, the built in TV in the bathroom was a great bonus.
The 24hour gym and the gorgeous pool are great. 
A must stay hotel!",5,2015,08,16
217,Simply stunning!,"5 Star quality. Couldn't fault the place! Pure luxury 
 Great staff, clean and well serviced. Great faculties and the gardens are stunning. This place will wow you in every single way. Not cheap but you get what you pay for. Would love to come back. ",5,2015,08,16
217,Don't Miss Powerscourt for great Golf and Lovely People,"We headed off to Ireland for five days of golf, rest and fun. Powerscourt was a fantastic destination. Lovely hotel, great people, and terrific golf. The concierge, though is really special. Robbie Smyth is just someone who stayed in touch with us from the time we made our reservations through our parting hugs. What a great man. The food was amazing. The golf was on two wonderful courses. Since they don't have to double you up my husband and i played by ourselves and we truly enjoyed the beauty, the golf and each other.",5,2015,08,16
217,Stunning!,"I recently stayed here for my birthday with my husband and two children we stayed in a Junior Suite, it was faultless. Beautiful hotel, grounds, spa, lovely buffet breakfast if your looking for luxury this is the place to go can't wait to stay again next year!",5,2015,08,14
217,Do NOT have afternoon tea here!,"i had a 70 euro voucher for afternoon tea for two. I would not recommend this to anyone. The staff on arrival were completely disinterested in us, we were left for 15 mins before anyone came near us, we had one waiter for the afternoon who did not look after us at all. I asked for a jug of iced water which took ages to come, when he did arrive it was with two glasses no jug,   We had to ask for milk as there was none in the milk jug, we had to ask for extra hot water and two extra tea bags for our tea.  The food was horrible, the sandwiches are not freshly prepared, the bread on the coronation chicken was hard  and cold from being in the fridge all day.  There was an unexplained crusting of coriander on the sandwich which we had to scrap off with a knife!! We did not finish the sandwiches because the quality was so poor. We felt ignored for the whole afternoon and anytime we tried to make eye contact with the staff we were ignored, when our waiter did acknowledge us it was with a finger in the air and mouthing "" one minute"" we asked for our dessert and were told to wait until our table had been cleared, he said it to me like i was a bold child!! For some reason i said sorry! We decided to take our desserts home with us as we no longer wanted to be there.  We handed in our voucher at the cash desk and again we were told to wait, i went to the toilet and when i came back mum was still standing there being ignored. I went to the bar to talk to another of staff and told her we were not happy, she looked right through me. A manager who was behind the bar with her back to me, casually looked over her shoulder and told me the machine was not working and they had to get another one and to wait!! When the waiter arrived back he walked straight past us, we asked him were we ok to go and he said "" yes, you don't pay anything"" which we knew because we had the voucher but we were made feel that until the voucher was verified we were not to leave.  All in all a horrible soulless place, they did not host us for the afternoon, please do not waste your money on this establishment and if the ritz carlton took their name seriously they should remove it from this establishment.",2,2015,08,14
217,A gem in the Emerald Isle,"From the first moment we stepped into the hotel, till the last when we left,everything was absolutely perfect. All the staff from the receptionist,waiters/waitresses, bar staff to cleaners were extremely helpful and friendly giving the hotel a lovely relaxed atmosphere.
 We had a 1 bedroom suite which was quite simply massive, the bedroom alone was bigger than most rooms we have stayed in.
  But what made our break so special was the food, all the ingredients were beautifully fresh and well cooked wether that be breakfast, bar food or in the restaurant. But special mention has to go to the Sika restaurant, the food here is some of, if not the best we have ever tasted. Coupled with excellent, knowledgeable staff, it provided a wonderful eating experience and the highlight of our stay.
  If your ever in Wicklow don't miss out on this gem of a hotel, you won't be disappointed.",5,2015,08,14
217,Amazing! ,"3 couples went for an overnight get away! Only 30 minutes door to door from our dublin home yet it's such a getaway treat we felt like we were away for a week!! 

We booked the chefs table for dinner in the kitchen so it was a real treat. The choc sphere for dessert is a must! 

Rooms were amazing if a little difficult to find at night !!!!! 

I really feel this hotel offers all the luxury of a 5 star ",5,2015,08,13
217,Perfect for special occasion!!,"I booked a one bedroom suite to celebrate my wife's birthday. Checked in via the Marriott app which was great, the room was excellent and they even personal delivered some birthday treats for my wife. Location is great, and you can walk around the estate including down the nearby Avoca store. A few niggles in the room, had a long balcony but there was no furniture on it. We were able to take the chairs in room out but it was a little annoying. There was no dressing table in the room which given the size of it was a shame. My wife had to get ready on the floor in the walk in wardrobe. Dinner was lovely with good service and the spa is also excellent. The only thing I didn't like was the different men's and women's spa facilities. Sat alone for 20mins... Got bored and left. All in all, an excellent spot, great staff and definitely a destination for a special location!",5,2015,08,13
217,.We deserve this magic!!,"Go on you are worth a night in this  dream hotel. Lovely kind welcoming staff, super rooms and  the most gorgeous meal in Sika washed down with some great wine and off to a great nights sleep in a big comfy bed...and then when you think it cannot get any better open your curtains in the morning and see the mist on the Sugar Loaf mountain..The best view in Ireland. Yes go on because  we all deserve  a little bit of magic a night here is worth a week anywhere else.",5,2015,08,13
217,Placid Pretty Powerscourt,"We really enjoyed our mini-break at Powerscourt. Everyone was wonderfully friendly and very engaging with our 16 year old little girl. The suite was spacious and well suited to our needs. The bed was nice and comfortable. The Housekeeping service was prompt and very efficient. 

We often do too much on a holiday - lots of sightseeing etc, but we made a point of just staying on the estate. There's plenty to do. Numerous walks (we did the River Walk), visiting Powerscourt House and Gardens (with lovely locally sourced shops), Powerscourt Waterfall (which is a great spot to picnic and has play structures for children), and a little bit of stolen time at the Spa for Mom. There's also a little play structure on the hotel's land which we didn't find until the morning we were leaving. 

There's plenty to do, it's a beautiful hotel in gorgeous surroundings, with super friendly staff. It's well worth it!",5,2015,08,13
217,"Great service, lovely location","Friendly staff and big comfortable rooms. 
Food in bars and restaurants were excellent 
Pool is large and other spa facilities are fantastic

Our room has a view of the sugar loaf and gardens towards the south of the resort",5,2015,08,12
217,Want to go back NOW,"Two couples. We stayed one night and cannot wait to go back for a longer visit.
Very peaceful surroundings and the room was amazing. Could do Dublin from this location but next visit is to relax and enjoy the beautiful spa.
Beautiful gardens to visit and waterfall nearby.",5,2015,08,12
217,3rd Visit,"We arrived on Sunday of the Aug bank holiday at 1.30.  Our room was ready & we were up graded to a suite with a mountain view because it was our Wedding anniversary.  The room was amazing with stunning views.  A young lad showed us to our room & he was very friendly.  We had a drink in the sugar loaf bar & than decided to go up to the Village, the courtesy car brought us up & told us when we were ready to get the bar man in the pub to ring the hotel & they would come down & collect us which they did.  We than had drinks in McGills bar downstairs, this bar was very busy & had a really nice buzz about the place but it would have been better if they had some music on. We ordered breakfast in bed for the Monday morning.  It arrived on a hot trolley, it was very tasty.  We had a really enjoyable stay & we hope to come back soon.",5,2015,08,12
217,Best hotel in Ireland,"I've stayed in the hotel at least 3 times. We love everything about this hotel . The rooms are faboulous with a huge balcony , the food is excellent in the restaurant . Best breakfast We have ever had in a hotel , always hot and plenty of choices ( my pretender is a chef and he was impressed ). I dor and outdoor playground makes this hotel perfect for a family break . The staff are very helpful and very friendly .  I would say it's the best hotel in Ireland .Every time we stayed here made us wanna come back more .we will definitely be back .",5,2015,08,12
217,Perfect in Every Way,"The hotel and grounds are a stunning oasis, and we were treated so well from the moment we arrived to our departure.  Walking into the foyer is an experience in itself, a grand entrance and a style that is matched throughout the rest of the hotels and the rooms.  We were treated to a corner room on level 5, and it had everything you expect and more.  Everything was so comfortable, from the couches and soft furnishings, to the King sized bed.  Bathroom and accessories are all excellent, with double basin, and shower toilet and bath all well set up.  WiFi is provided free of charge and is available throughout the property.The staff were helpful, and even included an introductory walk through of the hotel facilities on the way to the room.  Would have loved to stay for a few more days.",5,2015,08,12
217,Could/should be better,"I've stayed in a number of 5 star hotels in Ireland, the Europe being the last one before here, and the contrasts are stark in comparison. 

The room was nice, good size, nice bed and bathroom. However the bar was terrible, no entertainment, even though it's the height of tourist season. 

The food in the bar is very unimaginative, the Guinness in the upstairs bar was terrible, and the other beers was flat. The staff were nice, and were quite professional at all times. There are some decorative issues in some of the hallways where water is leaking through the plasterwork

The checkout was a disaster, hardly any staff to deal with everybody leaving. It really needs to to rectified ASAP. These issues are really not what should be expected at a 5* hotel. Such a pity",3,2015,08,11
217,Another lovely stay,"Returning for another 2 night stay treat, did not disappoint. Hotel was much busier than our last visit in February, but loads of staff around in the Sugar Loaf lounge to attend to everyone on a full Sunday afternoon. We once again where staying in a room on the 6th floor overlooking the fountain with a mountain view. Love these rooms, spacious, bright and a huge comfortable bed with a terrace which allows my husband and I to share a bottle or 2 of champagne while enjoying the view, but the garden furniture seems to have been removed since February, a small fault. The ipod docking station also seemed to have been removed since our last visit.
The whole estate is beautifully maintained, we walked down the avenue heading to the village and then back and into the gardens next door, lovely. A swim in the pool was next on the to do list, relaxing and quiet, we made a point to go outwith the kids allowed time. A late lunch in the Sugar Loaf lounge again and the staff where just as attentive. As a vegetarian maybe a few extra choices would be nice, but I opted for my previous days lunch and stuck with the falafel, very tasty. The martini I ordered was pricey, but I could taste the alcohol, so no complaints from me. Breakfast is served in the Sika restaurant and the choice is fantastic, healthy or full on Irish.  Daniel who had been working in the lounge too was very attentive and nothing was too much trouble, a lovely young man and definitely instilled the 5 star service. We definitely look forward to returning soon. 
",5,2015,08,11
217,Confusion at best,"Having read a number of press reports about how accommodating this hotel was towards small dogs, I emailed them on Sunday evening to check availability for a dog friendly room for 2 people and one small dog from this Tuesday for 2 nights. I had no response until Monday evening at around 5.30pm. Yes, I was told, that would be fine and was given a rate including the charge for the dog.  20 minutes later I had a further email from a different member of staff - clearly unaware o the first email - stating that unfortunately there were no dog friendly rooms available this week.  I replied to say I was confused - and would welcom clarification.  I did not receive a reply.   I then telephoned the hotel and spoke to a gentleman who said he would need to check if the hotel accepted pets at all!!  He came back to say that yes, a pet friendly room was available. Now, feeling somewhat concerned I sent another email asking for confirmation in writing before making the 3 hour journey. Again, no reply. I then tweeted the hotel as ask if someone could reply. Still nothing as of now - midnight on Monday night. Given that we were due to travel in the morning - it is very disappointing and far from a five star expereince so far. So we shall go elsewhere. If this experience is any indication of what we might expect at the hotel - I feel we have had a lucky escape.

217,"Wow, what a stunning hotel!","This hotel certainly has the wow factor. It's not cheap, but as a special treat, it's worth every single penny.

My husband and I booked one night here, whilst the grandparents kindly looked after our children. We were in awe as we arrived in the stunning Reception area. A bonus was seeing Brian Dowling, who was was checking out as we checked in (he got married at the hotel a few days earlier)!

Our Mountain View room was enormous, with gorgeous views over the gardens to the Sugar Loaf Mountain. (It's worth paying extra for the view.) The huge king sized bed was one of the most comfortable I've ever slept in.

We'd booked a package which included dinner in the Sugar Loaf Lounge. We were allowed to choose anything from the menu, including any extras, so we both had three courses, including lamb and beef mains - all of which were delicious. 

We had pre-dinner drinks in the Irish bar, McGills. It was packed, so it had a great atmosphere, You can eat here too, and the food coming out looked delicious. 

Breakfast the next morning was served in the Sika restaurant. Unfortunately the weather didn't allow us to sit outside to enjoy the beautiful views - to be expected in Ireland, I guess! The selection of food available was frankly the best we've ever seen (and we've stayed at some stunning hotels). 

We can't wait to stay at the Powerscourt Hotel again... We just need to start saving up again!",5,2015,08,09
217,Worst 5 Star Hotel I ever stayed in... ,"This has got to be the worst waste of €800 (2 nights stay) - EVER 

DISASTER AFTER DISASTER 

1. Only one ladies, one gents, one disabled toilet on the main lobby floor where most of the foot traffic takes place. Loads of people forced to constantly queue. Unreal design failure !!! 

2. Food in the sugar loaf lounge was horrible. Service was awful and a few service staff had extremely less than satisfactory personalities.. I wrote a 2* rating on the bill and I would never return to this horrible place and it gets WORSE!!! 

3. Stunning views - yet you have to get a lift down 3 floors to go outside... No service exists there and no seats for parents to sit while kids are at the playground- UNREAL lack of foresight !! 

4. You can't open windows - so you are effectively trapped in a stuffy , almost claustrophobic environment.. Unreal that the 5* hotel doesn't allow fresh air in.

5. I stayed in room 640 - at a whopping €380 a night you again couldn't open any windows - and WORSE you pay for premium for a balcony mountain view - not one out door seat exists in any balcony room., absolutely UNREAL !!! 

6. The spa & gym is truly amazing- with the exception of one really nice professional gym instructor - the rest of the staff were cocky and pompous- I guess reflecting the entire atmosphere of this horrendous hotel. 

If you want a 5* experience - you will be hugely disappointed .. It's doesn't deserve even 2*

217,Vacation in Ireland ,"This was a fantastic hotel.  We used this hotel as our hotel base and traveled south to the Blarney Castle.  I wish we would have spent more time at the hotel.  Wish we could have toured the grounds.  Had a really nice suite room.  The staff was very friendly and helpful.  We were tired of Irish food and they suggested Italian food at the village, which was quite good!",5,2015,08,09
217,Anniversary Treat,"Highly recommend this hotel. Literally didn't know what to expect but once you drive up the long avenue & enter the revolving doors, it is pure luxury from there on in. We were upgraded to a mountain view suite which was out of this world. Both myself & my hubby had spa treatments & they were amazing. Spa is fabulous, so relaxing.. Dinner in Sike restaurant was probably a bit too posh / fine dining for us but at the same time we enjoyed what we had. I would say however that €5 for a cappuccino added on to the already expensive dinner bill was ""a bit irish""!! Would definitely recommend this hotel for a short getaway for a special occasion. We'll definitely be back.",5,2015,08,08
217,Fantastic! 5 Star ++ One of the best non-Ritz hotels I've ever stayed in!,"This has to be one of the most beautiful and magnificent hotels in the world if you love nature.  The grounds of Powerscourt are absolutely breathtaking, beginning with the tree-lined entry.  The staff was absolutely amazing and the service was just impeccable.  The rooms were huge and fitted with everything we could think of, including converters for our American appliances.  The indoor swimming pool at ESPA, shining with Swarovski crystals is simply gorgeous.  You can walk to Powerscourt Gardens and the quaint town of Enniskerry, yet you're still only a few minutes drive from the coast and a quick 30 minutes on the expressway to Dublin!  I would definitely return here time and time again.",5,2015,08,08
217,Anniversary break,"We returned for an overnight dinner & spa break to celebrate our anniversary .

Dinner at Sika restaurant was excellent. Great food & wine at reasonable prices. The spa experience is fantastic and a great way to escape. 

The hotel itself is stunning ..a throwback to the classy jazz age with Art Deco touches in the foyer & sugarloaf lounge with stunning mountain views. 

Service is second to none with friendly & helpful staff that blend into the background. 

We have been back several times for afternoon tea/ drinks after a hike up the sugarloaf. 

Looking forward to our return  for another overnight break.

217,Amazing Hotel and the best Concierge staff,"We have just returned from a weeks stay at Powerscourt Hotel.  Firstly the concierge staff are the best that we have ever come across.  We arrived In the midst of a very glam, celebrity wedding that was taking place, we were covered head to toe in mud after a day mountain biking, the staff greeted us like we were old friends, took our bikes off us and stored them and helped us through reception - this was the theme of their help all week.  They were brilliant!

The hotel itself is absolutely stunning, we had a room on the 3rd floor overlooking the mountains, I didn't think that you could wake up to a better view - until I saw the breakfast buffet!!!. Breakfast was a pleasure, the food was amazing.

The attention to detail in the room was perfect, loved the TV in the mirror in the bathroom.  The size of the rooms were huge and comfortable.

McGills pub is worth a visit, we visited most nights and again the staff are great and the atmosphere is good.

We will definitely be going back to Powerscourt, hopefully this October.",5,2015,08,07
217,Beautiful resort hotel. Wonderful experience.,"We stayed here for one night in July, arriving at noon after an all night flight from the USA. We had quite a time finding the large Powerscourt Estate (our gps kept getting us near and then pointing us slightly wrong), but once found we were enormously impressed.  [Also worth noting that while the famous Powerscourt Gardens are adjoining the hotel, we had assumed the Powerscourt Waterfall was also near and it was actually a considerable drive away.] 

The lobby and public areas are quite beautiful, mostly traditional Georgian with some whimsical ceiling ornaments/chandeliers.  Our room was simply enormous - probably one of the biggest I have ever stayed in - with a truly lovely view of the grounds and a balcony.The fitness center and pool were attended and quite large.  We took a tour and, even near closing time, the indoor pool was popular  [but not overly crowded].

The service was consistently excellent - welcoming, kind, professional.

Arriving prior to checkin, we had lunch (club sandwich and iced tea) with a nice view in the Lounge while we waited.  It was good enough that we came back again for lunch the next day.

We had booked with one dinner at Sika as part of our package.  This was quite an experience, including delicious food plated artistically enough to be worth taking a picture. When we asked about some of the wines on the menu, an expert came by and gave some inexpensive recommendations that really complemented our meal. 

I would love to stay there again on a longer trip.",5,2015,08,06
217,3 week stay for work,"I really enjoyed my stay at this lovely hotel.  The room was one of the largest I've ever stayed at in a hotel, I loved the seperate dressing area and the Bathroom is a DREAM!  Bed was very comfy, my room was on the 4th floor and I opened my windows at night and it was so cool and lovely to wake up to chirping birds.  I was there for 3 weeks and can say it was one of my best hotel experiences.  The grounds are beautiful, I walked every night and a couple of nights I borrowed a bike and went for a ride (free of charge bike usage for guests).  I have no complaints about my stay at the Powerscourt and hope to return again someday for pleasure.
I utilized room service several times and was always pleased, the breakfast buffet is NOT to be missed...they had the best porridge and I had it everyday (I wish I had some now), very plentiful and fresh buffet with as wide a range of selections as I've ever seen.  They really go out of their way to accomodate their guests.",5,2015,08,06
217,Fantastic Hotel,"The restaurant is more than excellent with very attentive service. We got upgraded to a suite with mountain view, it was pure luxury!
One flaw, the reception staff somewhat lacks communication with services, eventhough extremely nice. 
We would go back without hesitation as it was worth its money.",5,2015,08,06
217,Beautiful hotel,"Beautiful hotel, one of the best in Ireland. Nice walks in the area and overall a comfortable stay. I would definitely stay here again in the future and hope to check out the restaurant. We are in the bar and found the food okay. Staff very helpful and rooms clean. ",5,2015,08,05
217,Our honeymoon stay.,"We were very happy with our room . We stayed 3 nights. Twice our power cut out in the room and we had to call an engineer.  Once it took quite a while and my husband could not iron a shirt for dinner. Minor problem . We ate in the restraunt the first and third nights. The first was very good service, everyone was very attentive. The food was lovely. Worth every penny. The third night we ate there the service was lacking a little. The second night  we ate in the bar . We ordered starters ,scallops and pâté. The pâté was surrounded with enough butter to feed 4. It was off putting . The scallops were over cooked. We ordered the tex mex platter next . Almost 2 hours later we got a tray of chips, over cooked onion rings , a tiny portion of ribs drowned in sweet sticky sauce , this was caked on the tray soaking into the chips. We got a huge portion of wings , these are the first wings I have ever not eaten they were horrible , sickly sweet. There was also 4 pieces of garlic cheesy bread? This was so disappointing. On an up side the breakfast was the best I ever had in a hotel . The scrambled eyes were to die for.",4,2015,08,04
217,Casual Elegance!,"We recently stayed at the Powerscourt Hotel for 4 nights. The front desk staff were very friendly, accommodating, and efficient. The room was huge with double sinks in the bathroom and plenty of space to move around. The hotel grounds and surrounding area are exquisite! The views, places to walk, and outdoor spaces including the entry drive were stunning. The lobby was beautiful and kept so with amazing displays of fresh flowers. The restaurant breakfast staff were all also friendly and efficient. The food was delicious with abundant selections from which to choose. My one nitpick would be that there is no place to plug in a blow dryer in the bathroom and no place to use a blow dryer near a mirror elsewhere in the room. Nevertheless, this is a top drawer facility and we LOVED our stay here. The location is convenient to many places on the ""to visit"" list in Ireland including a local train station (in Bray) that can whisk you into Dublin conveniently.",5,2015,08,03
217,Dogs running around corridors and allowed to stay in rooms,"I stayed one night in this hotel. I did not expect to be in a room beside a barking dog. This is supposed to be a 5 star hotel, not a glorified farmyard. Can you imagine booking a room where the previous incumbent has been a canine? Totally disgusted.",1,2015,08,02
217,Wonderful,"Visited with extended family in 4 rooms so between us we got to see all the room types and all were superb.
During our stay our party availed of most of the hotel services including the spa and room service.
The staff are all first class and really make the stay special.

If you are looking for a relaxing break in a top quality hotel I highly recommend this place.",5,2015,08,02
217,Great resort but..,"Fantastic rooms, spa and the pool area is stunning. Fell in love with this place frm the minute we drove up the tree and mountain lined driveway. Breakfast was good but feel the restaurant is lacking due to the fine dining style food on offer. The other less fine dining options are very highly priced considering the quality and taste of what's on offer. Staff could be friendlier as when trying to check in we were told our card was not accepted then declined on two occasions after that. This was embarrassing as our card had no fault it was simply the receptions check in machines. I found the foreign girl on reception quite rude about this and she did not even apologise for the hotels error. Not a great first impression for a 5 star resort especially being embarrassed in front of other hotel guests at reception. I also found room service slow and had to call on three occasions for water to be brought to the room as staff simply forgot. Service needs to improve greatly to live up to a 5 star standard. 

There are great dining options in Enniskerry itself, Bray and at Johnnie Fox's in Glencullen. Better to eat there than at the hotel. 

Also not keen on the stale food smell you can notice when entering at the reception, clearly from the dining area close by. It smelt of fish a few times and rather of putting. ",4,2015,08,02
217,"Unfortunately, Not A Five Star Experience.","The hotel website states – ‘we offer a five star, one-of-a-kind destination for guests of all type’. For me, ‘five star’ should mean perfection and unfortunately that was not my experience. There wasn’t even a customer comment card that I could complete to record my comments. When checking out, I mentioned one of my dissatisfactions and was advised that I would be getting an automatic email and could reply to it with my comments. Nearly three weeks later, I’m still waiting for that email – hardly a ‘five star’ performance – and so I will air my comments here. In fairness, it was mainly minor details that I have issue with, but I would not expect them to arise in a ‘five star’ hotel or for the price that I had paid to stay here. 
Check in was efficient, but you are not offered to be brought to your room – you are given directions. The room was very nice, although, for me, the writing desk in the middle of the floor gave it a bit of an ‘office’ feel – I got used to it eventually. The A/C was a noisy one, but as we couldn’t open any window,  we had to put up with the noise during the night. The bathroom was very nice and spacious but the rainforest shower was pretty weak and getting into the bath may be problematic for some, as the side of the bath is hide and wide. Only one armchair in the bedroom – so what happens if two want to watch the TV? The mini bar was expensive. There is an electronic finger tip panel in each of the bedside lockers for the lights, A/C, etc, which was a bit hit and miss for us (we are not the techie type!). This control unit had a calendar and clock display, but both the date (7/7/2000) and time showing on the clock were seriously incorrect – it’s only a small thing, inconsequential really, but a good ‘five star’ hotel would ensure that the correct time and date is displayed. It should be all about impression. 
There must be nobody walking around the hotel keeping their eye on things, as should be expected in ‘five star’. I noticed when we were sitting in the lobby area that tables were not being cleared. Guests who had eaten or had drinks at these tables had departed from the tables, but the tables were not being cleared promptly - a full hour in the case of three separate tables that I was watching. Tables should be cleared immediately once the guests have left, particularly in the lobby area. 
Breakfast was particularly disappointing. We arrived down about 9.25AM at the Sika restaurant, to be told that they had had a big crowd for breakfast and that they did not have time to reset the tables  -  well hello! – five star means you should be fully prepared for situations like this. Surely they should have known how many guests to expect for breakfast and staff the restaurant accordingly. We were directed to go upstairs to the Sugar Loaf lounge rather than being given a choice of going up there or perhaps waiting 5/10 minutes while a table was reset. In ‘five star’ you give guests choices.  
If you book a room only, it is an additional €29 for a buffet breakfast which was not value for that price. I could not help but feel that the breakfast in the Sugar Loaf lounge was different to what might be provided in the Sika restaurant. I would expect a ‘five star’ hotel would provide a breakfast menu and serve the hot food, but not in this hotel. You are expected to get everything yourself, only your tea or coffee is brought to the table by the waiting staff. There was no waste bin to dispose of the cereal cartons, an empty tray with a water jug was left on top of the fruit juice glasses, the butter pats were left in the strong sun, melting. Is there anybody watching for the little things? I had the bacon – it was very near cold, quite unpleasant. My wife didn’t realise where the butter was and had returned to the table without any. She asked one of the waiting staff if she could have some butter to be told ‘the butter is over there’. In ‘five star’ the correct answer would have been, ‘I’ll get you some straight away’. Not so here, you are expected to get it yourself. Also, it was very noticeable that the breakfast waiting staff in the Sugar Loaf lounge avoided eye contact at all times, maybe to ensure that they were not asked for anything – it took us a while to get a second pot of tea. Maybe it is a better experience in the Sika restaurant for breakfast?
The Spa area was nothing to get excited about – a steam room, a jaccuzi and a pool. I think the towels have seen better days!
Dinner in the Sika restaurant was included in our package (separately it is €60 for a three course meal) and it was a very pleasant experience. Our meal was very good. Joel our waiter was extremely friendly and attentive without being intrusive - he was alert at all times - that’s what I would expect from a ‘five star’ hotel. The only negative about the dinner experience was the price of a cappuccino and a latte – average size cups - €4.95 EACH.
Overall it was an average to good experience, but disappointing because we did not get the ‘five star’ experience that we had been anticipating – for me, too many small things not up to ‘five star’ standard.   Unfortunately, I would not be interested in returning.",3,2015,08,02
217,"First class, very difficult to fault, the staff and everything about the hotel is simply wonderful","I can not fault the hotel itself, we have stayed dozens of times, the food, staff and spa are of a very high standard. One of the best pools and spa treatments ever. Over the years we have recommended it to friends and they have all went back and recommended to other friends. Over all the times we have stayed I have only had one issue regarding the Rewards Scheme, if you stay a number of nights you get one free, I am now starting to ask myself is this a con ? I have stayed over the required nights but the Rewards Team appear to be a law onto themselves and once I got to the target of nights they made one excuse after another not to reward me with my points. I feel cheated and taken for a fool, but this is a hotel that is still hard to beat in other ways apart from the cost, which could be the reason why I still do not have my free night despite years of staying.",5,2015,08,01
217,no thrills at Mcgills,this hotel is fantastic for a romantic break the pool the bedrooms and the staff are 1st class and Sika restaurant is a classy experience and quite reasonably priced for the standards they offer BUT BEWARE Magills bar we ask for 2 mojito cocktails the barman disappeared for 30 minutes i assume to google how to make a mojito when we eventually got the substandard cocktails we were charged 30 euro avoid like the plague...,4,2015,07,30
217,Unbelievably luxurious!,"I'm still in awe of what a wonderful retreat this place is. We were dead tired after 25 hours of travel and so pleasantly surprised by the luxury that awaited us at Powerscourt. We had two deluxe rooms, absolutely huge, luxuriously appointed in decor and furnishings... Double door entry to your marble bathroom with a separate rainfall shower and enormous tub. The bed was so comfortable, and the air con, lights, and do not disturb could all be controlled on a touch screen in your nightstand! The spa area and fitness room are large and very nice! Do not miss the pool! One morning we borrowed bikes (complimentary) and took them down the river walk, where hotel guests have access. Of course you'll visit the Powerscourt Gardens  and house. We had lunch at the cafe there and it was all lovely. Breakfast at the hotel was equally spectacular and did not disappoint. We are from the states and I actually appreciated that there was no one else from the states there that we could tell! Finally, I'll just say that Robbie the concierge was great and helped us out a couple times with great recommendations. The whole experience was a great introduction to Ireland, thanks!",5,2015,07,29
217,Beautiful hotel so close to Dublin city...,"Stayed here with the gf for a night, and was well impressed.

The location is perfect. Just a half hour from Dublin's south side and positioned smack bang in the Wicklow countryside. There's a beautiful winding drive up to the hotel which looks really amazing on arrival. The lobby area is very grand and the views are fantastic.

We had a suite which was huge, 66 sq/m with beautiful views overlooking the Sugarloaf mountain. Very classy set up. The bathroom is massive, beds are great and the living area is quite regal!

We booked in for dinner, which was fine. It reads well on the menu, but neither of us was blown away at all. The staff were exceptionally attentive and really couldn't do enough for us. 

Breakfast was lovely. Buffet style and very tasty. The spa was nice. I really expected a bit more from a 5 star to be honest, but it was decent, just not to the standard of others. The temperature in the steam room was absolutely ridiculous. Almost burned the face off me!

There was one major negative though during our stay which put a bit of a sour taste in our mouth. When booking, we ordered a bottle of prosecco for the room which was brought up soon after we arrived. When we were checking out we realised they charged us €5 for bringing it up to the room. Personally I feel if you are paying exorbitant money for a one night stay in a five star hotel you expect them to do the little touches for you. There is nothing they don't charge you for in Powerscourt though... 

Overall, would recommend.",4,2015,07,29
217,Underwhelming ,"We stayed here in two rooms (3 ppl in one, 2 ppl in the other) that were booked 7 months ago. Upon arrival, we were given rooms on separate floors (not the end of the world). But when we entered our room, we noticed others' belongings in it! So back down to reception. We were given another room on the other side of the hotel on a different floor. No one helped or offered to help with luggage. Entered that room and there was 1 bed. Nope. So back to reception. But we were stuck on the floor for 5 minutes because the lift button was broken and no one answered at reception. We finally got to our other room back to the other side of the hotel on yet another floor with no luggage assistance. My husband said he talked to another couple that was also given an already occupied room too. Oh, and I forgot to mention that absolutely no information was given about anything - no dining times, no info about the pool or spa, no code for the River Walk (I was given this by some nice people who worked at the Gardens down the road). This surprised me. I have stayed at many places big and small and they've all been helpful. Not here. No one was mean but no one seemed to want to be hospitable. Our room was nice but the door didn't close without us pressing in the lock in the door-not the typical lock you think of but the actual locking mechanism. When we left, it went smoother than when we arrived. But I think we were all ready for some place that cared whether we were there or not. It wasn't this one. ",2,2015,07,28
217,decadent,"From the moment we waked in I felt elegance.  The lobby was decorated for xmas, and the staff were so helpful. They even drove me down to the village for dinner and picked me up when i was ready to return to the hotel. The closet was so spacious, and the heated tile bathroom floor decadent. I cant wait to stay here again our next visit.",5,2015,07,26
217,Great place in a fantastic setting,"I had the pleasure of staying here for a conference for two days. Driving up to it and overlooking the Sugar Loaf and the Garden of Ireland you are reminded about the beauty of Ireland especially on a nice summers day. During the conference we had a buffet lunch in the restaurant as well as pastries and cakes during the breaks and both was excellent. I particularly remember the banoffee in a glas for desert and it was delicious. As for the rooms they are very spacious with separate dressing area, huge bathroom with shower & bath and the bed were very comfortable. Overall it was a very pleasant stay which was complemented by the attentive and friendly staff. Keep in mind that it is a place with old world charm so don't expect a modern interior (except maybe the automatic curtains).",5,2015,07,26
217,"Great for couples, not so good if travelling with a baby!","We have stayed at Powerscourt in the past as a couple and found it to be a great hotel.  However, we have now come back with our 8 month old and have had a very different experience.

We had a drink in the sugar loaf lounge before thinking about getting some dinner.  We then looked at our dining options and found them to be very limited.  We were advised that our baby could only go to the sika restaurant if she was asleep - anyone with a baby will appreciate that this is impossible, therefore this was out.  This left us with the Irish bar, which only had limited normal height seats and wasn't overly baby friendly.  The last resort was room service which we settled on.

For such a large hotel the dining options are extremely limited if travelling with a baby and something else needs to be offered to parents who are not looking to eat in their room whilst on holiday!!!!!",3,2015,07,24
217,Excellent hotel,"We stayed here recently for one night. The rooms are beautiful, really large and spacious. We had a view of the water feature at the back of the hotel and the mountains. The bed is quite large and very comfortable. The bathroom is amazing, it had a TV in the mirror! There is also a large wardrobe. All toiletries were provided. 

I wish I'd have had more time to explore the grounds as the bit we did see were lovely. They were so well kept. The hotel itself is quite large. There is restaurants and bars on site and they do provide a shuttle bus to the town free of charge.

The only negative thing I could say was the breakfast was pretty poor for a five star hotel. Most of the cooked food was luke warm and I only got one small coffee as you had to ask staff for service. There were also staff vacuuming as people were eating breakfast which was really noisy. Also the wifi was really poor throughout the hotel.

If Powerscourt were to improve there breakfast and wifi this would easily get a 5 on TripAdvisor. All that being said I would still recommend staying here if looking for a nice weekend away. ",4,2015,07,24
217,Awesome location and hotel,"We recently spent three nights in this wonderful hotel. We had a suite on the sixth floor with a mountain view.It was one of the best hotel rooms I had ever stayed in--so spacious and well appointed. The thing I liked best was the television in the bathroom mirror----only seen it once before in a hotel in West Palm beach florida.
We enjoyed a swim in the spa pool--I did find the lighting very dull however. We ate in the sika restaurant one evening and loved it. Also really loved the breakfast and on the final morning we had it al fresco on the terrace---which was a first for me in ireland. Its location next to Powerscourt house and wonderful gardens and the views of Sugar loaf mountain make it stunning. I would highly recommend a stay in this beautiful hotel---it would be wonderful for a special occasion.",5,2015,07,24
217,Fabulous if you want to have a break away,This hotel is super fabulous the staff really go the extra mile. We had an extremely enjoyable stay with our four legged friend here she was treated like a princess and loved the staff and the room also. The hotel is very well decorated and the rooms are beautiful. We would return and certainly would recommend. As we were traveling with our puppy we had meals in the room mainly and these were really good to. Thanks for a lovely stay walks are good to. ,5,2015,07,22
217,Fantastic stay,"We stayed in suite 549 and all I can say is WOW!  All the pictures supplied by the management don't do this hotel justice.  A short walk from the hotel is powerscourt house (which holds an Avoca store) and gardens.  We stayed for 2 nights having dinner in both restaurants (really recommend) and used the spa facilities.  As we didn't book treatments we didnt have access to most facilities but the pool, recliners, jacuzzi and haman suite were adequate, it was fun tipping a bucket of freezing water over our heads after roasting in the hottest part of the haman suite.",5,2015,07,21
217,Wonderful relaxing night away.,We had a really enjoyable night away here. Our suite was beautiful and spacious. We spent a lovely relaxing time by the pool. It was a really calm and serene environment and the staff were helpful at all times. We had dinner in the bar. As a vegetarian I found the selection and choices were great. The food was delicious and it was really good value for money. The breakfast was to die for. We really enjoyed our stay and would recommend it to anyone looking for a chance to unwind and to get away from it all.,5,2015,07,18
217,"Absolutely incredible experience, whatever the situation","We booked a mountain view room for six nights on a whim (picked a completely random place to go using accumulated travel points and settled on Ireland) and were absolutely not disappointed.  This property was far more beautiful than anticipated.  Our room was far more than we expected.

Everything about this hotel was amazing.  For starters, we flew into Dublin and rented a car.  Driving to the hotel, the surrounding landscape was absolutely beautiful.  The staff at the reception desk were wonderful.  They were both incredibly welcoming as well as helpful.  Guest services, who assisted us in moving our luggage and parking our vehicle, were prompt, polite and discrete (not that we had anything embarrassing, but they were consummate professionals). 

Throughout our stay, everything about the experience was great.  Our bed was comfortable (perfect for sleeping in), the grounds were beautiful (perfect for a relaxing day) and the location was convenient (perfect for day trips into Dublin).  We have nothing to complain about for this hotel.  This was our first trip to Ireland.  We had a perfect experience of site-seeing in the city (Dublin) and enjoying the natural beauty that Ireland has to offer (the nearby Wicklow mountains, along with other day-trips).  

I cannot under-praise the Powerscourt hotel.  Although I paid for my stay with travel rewards/points, I am aware of the per-night cost.  I would have zero hesitation to stay with this hotel at this rate.  Further, We were out-of-town (country?) guests, but it was clear that this hotel was a wonderful experience for local couples/families looking to get away for the weekend.

The pool and hot tub area are incredible.  My one regret regarding our stay is not taking advantage of the world-class spa.  The restaurants complemented the property wonderfully and fit in with the overall attitude of the site.  That said, the dining options were a little pricey given the limited options.

I would recommend this hotel to anyone looking to spend time in Ireland (or anywhere amazing, for that matter).",5,2015,07,18
217,Time to relax,"An excellent venue an hour from Dublin City. Our first time at this hotel and we thoroughly enjoyed our time there, the extremely spacious rooms, facilities, spa, grounds, views and restaurant were faultless. A nice touch were the scones and cream provided in the room on arrival.
Some confusion on the layout of the hotel, unable to use stairs to access the restaurant and facilities due to locked glass doors (no handles!) at the end of corridors?
However, one other criticism would be some of the staff not being up to the 5 star standards as one would expect.
A request for a city map and local attractions was promised by reception, a further request was then made to the concierge but nothing ever arrived.
We collected the required information the following morning from a very helpful South African lady who made up for the previous days disappointment.
Finally now back home I realise that we have been charged twice on the invoice for a meal! So its email time!",5,2015,07,17
217,Amazing hotel,"Fabulous room really spacious and luxurious
The location is amazing and so relaxing.The spa facilities are wonderful and everything is spotlessly clean.the hotel also provided a courtesy car to enniskerry so we were able to eat in the small restaurants in the village and get a lift there and back in the evenings - an excellent touch",5,2015,07,16
217,Plush accommodation but room for improvement in customer care,"Faultless accommodation and facilities as you'd expect at this grade of hotel/ price, but "" could do significantly better"" in terms of customer care on arrival. Having travelled from Skibbereen on July 15th not only was neither of our two rooms ready at or after 3pm, my friend's and my mom [both of whom are in their mid eighties, have very limited mobility - plus my mom has Stage 5 Alzheimer's] had to stand beside our luggage until a bellhop was eventually sent to leave same to the respective rooms whilst my friend and I checked us in at 5pm. The perfunctory 'complimentary tea or coffee' was offered by frankly after a drive of some 5 hours all we wanted was some rest in our respective rooms after the journey. Thus in our experience of similarly graded/priced hotels the Powerscourt was very much a triumph of style over substance.",4,2015,07,16
217,Stunning hotel - beautiful location!!,"We were amazed - just seeing the building - and the wonderful views!! Stayed for 2 days and enjoyed every minute - what a place!! Staff at reception very friendly,  rooms absolutely suburb - and the views  - just beautiful! Rooms very nicely furnished, lovely little welcome  - scones with cream - and altogether a great stay - can recommend this to anybody who wishes to enjoy the irish countryside!! Opportunity to visit the Spa, play gold, go for walks - just pleasure all round!!",5,2015,07,16
217,Classy Hotel,"The hotel is set in a stunning area and there are so many attractions within a short distance its location couldn't be better!Food and service were excellent and the breakfast was top class.Spent a lot of time in the pool area where it is so relaxing and adults can chill in the peace and quiet after 6pm when kids are no longer permitted.
Will 100% return!",5,2015,07,15
217,A little disappointing !,"Ending our visit to Ireland with a 2 night stay at Ritz Carlton - now the Powerscourt Hotel was quite a let down.

Initially we were brought to a room that was already occupied by someone! Fortunately, the occupant was not in the room - good thing!!

When we were shown to our room it seemed close, low ceilinged. An oddly U shaped room. Plenty of windows - that didn't open.  Our view was nothing spectacular.  The bathroom on the other hand was huge, spacious and beautiful.

Housekeeping didn't show up until 4pm in the afternoon. Dinner at the bar was adequate- typical bar food.  Dinner at the restaurant was a little on the pricy side but enjoyable.

Fail to see the purpose of such a fancy spa where  guests must traipse all across the hotel lobby in their fluffy white robes to get to their destination for a spa treatment.

Not going back to stay but a nice place for dinner.",3,2015,07,15
217,You get what you pay for!,"It is in a superb location close enough to Dublin city centre but far enough to experience the peace and tranquility of the Irish countryside. The grounds around the hotel are beautiful. The hotel offers free bikes to explore the surrounding area which includes Powerscourt Estate, the Powerscourt Waterfall and Enniskerry.

There are 3 restaurants Sika, McGills pub and the Sugar Loaf lounge, of which I would highly recommend McGills. There also is an incredible buffet breakfast- you will not be disappointed.

The pool and steam room are great, though it closes at 9pm which is early. 

Service was excellent and all the staff were very friendly and accommodating. 

Our only disappointment was the room itself.  While it was clean and well appointed with touch screen control over lights, air con etc., we were put at the corner of the hotel in a room that was strangely shaped and had no view (despite being told otherwise).  Furthermore, the shower also did not work properly and during our first evening a worker mistakenly let himself into our room. 

Overall- an expensive stay (especially for a student) but if you want to treat yo'self and take a relaxing break, this is how to do it!",4,2015,07,14
217,"Very nice, but...","Very nice but there were a few things that niggled and its these that prevent me from writing a glowing review.  

Check in was smooth and we were a bit early but here we hit the first snag- our suite where we had requested a King bed wasn't available and  we ended up with two smaller doubles instead.  We had been told the room wouldn't be available for some time if we wanted the King but that the ""doubles were quite big"".  So we decided to go for it, wanting to get our weekend started. The doubles weren't anything to write home about it and I was sorry we didn't hold out for what we had originally requested.  The suite was lovely though, with good views of the hills.  Great bathroom, wonderful shower.

Next little snag was a want on us for a sparkling, decadent Afternoon Tea.  We had no idea this had to be booked in advance and we were turned away from the lounge, ending back up in our room with a disappointing soup and sandwich from room service for lunch. The usual here- overpriced and undersized, nothing special.

Robes on and down to the pool area, for what we were hoping would be a nice chilled-out time. Not to be. The place was like a zoo with not enough loungers and kids running absolutely riot.  A pram with a Lidl bag hanging from it laughably lowered the tone in the middle of the pool deck. It nearly ended up in the pool more than once.  We lasted about an hour here until the noise became unbearable, then made our escape back to the suite.  A bottle of Champagne brought with us saved the afternoon at this point.

Dinner was a delight- a really interesting pulled beef croquette as a starter followed by fillet of sea bass. I actually can't remember if we had dessert or not. I do remember a trolley with a dessert selection but can't for the life of remember if we made a selection, even to share.  A glass of wine each with dinner, followed by a cocktail after wards rounded out the evening.  Back to the room and to our tiny, disappointing double beds. Sleep quality was good though and I can't say anything in particular disturbed me overnight- I was wakened a few times though.  It was a stormy evening and we had the windows open, which I usually love.

Breakfast the next morning was amazing- everything under the sun and best spread I've ever seen in an Irish hotel. A sumptuous breakfast was walked off with access to the private River Walk. Too bad its not properly signed or looped. Having to retrace our footsteps to get back out again, I could have done without.

So all in all, not bad, and probably a lot of anything negative was down to the bank holiday weekend.  We may try again in the fall, when the kids are back to school.",3,2015,07,14
217,First Year Anniversary...They Nailed It!,"I was looking for somewhere special to take my wife for our first year wedding anniversary. My wife is now pregnant so we didn't want to go too far form Dublin, I wanted to do a nice walk that wasn't too strenuous for her and I wanted to surprise her with a picnic on the walk and spa treatment later on before dinner.
I got in touch with Powerscourt on a friends recommendation...they just couldn't have been more helpful. They have a map of walks (lots of different levels) that start and end at the hotel reception and they have a picnic basket that you can buy...so ticking a lot of boxes already. I was put through to the Spa (Espa)...I think the girls name was Mandy that I dealt with...she was excellent, very professional and very helpful. When I mentioned that my wife was pregnant she suggested as pre-natal massage and assured me she would have one of their most experiences masseuse's. 
The hotel is set in the Wicklow Woods and on the beautiful grounds of Powerscourt House and Estate. The Hotel is a really good 5 star and the interior is very impressive from the moment you drive in the gates. The public areas, the bedrooms....all beautiful. 
The bedroom and bathroom was huge and really well appointed, it was great to chill out here while my wife had a treatment downstairs. 
After that we went for dinner and Darragh (Manager) and his team couldn't have been more helpful,. The menu is simple and easy to understand...its one of those ""do a few items and do it well"" kind of restaurants and the food was just superb. I had Lamb for main and my Wife had Halibut...I honestly couldn't say which of the two tasted nicer...both were prefect!
We got very lucky the next morning as the sun was shining and we were able to sit outside on the restaurant terrace and have our breakfast Al Fresco! The setting is amazing as you look over the extraordinary display of fresh flowers in hanging baskets at the large gardens and then onto the mountainous backdrop beyond. 
The breakfast buffet itself is great...a huge selection of foods including large varieties of Pastries, Breads, Meats, Cheeses, Fruit, Granola, Yoghurt etc etc. Full hot breakfast buffet also available. There was more options of Eggs Benedict etc that you could order from the kitchen (included in the B&B rate) but to be fair...there was already so much choice I didn't know where to start!
To finish...its in amazing place to go and is really suitable for a couples weekend away...particularly if your celebrating something or otherwise marking an occasion..its that kind of place...a special kind of place.. 
Once again...Thank you to Mandy in the Spa and Darragh in the Restaurant...a fantastic time and we will be definitely be back!",5,2015,07,13
217,Huge potential let down by poor service,"The location of this Hotel is first class and the facilities are pretty good and would have earned a 4 or even star review but the service let it down.

We booked a suite for my Wife and I and a twin room with an extra bed for the children.  We requested they were together.

When we got there they claimed  the order had been placed wrong by booking.com and they only had one double room ordered.  They continued to blame booking.com which I thought was unprofessional, especially as they were not there to defend themselves.

Despite having the evidence of what I had booked in printed copy they couldn't change things to match the order and gave us two double rooms at opposite ends of the hotel from each other. Two of my teenage children had to sleep in small temporary beds which were not suitable. The Hotel weren't upfront on what they were providing and if I hadn't insisted on not paying the price of a suite - they would have charged the full price.  All in all check in took over an hour.",3,2015,07,12
217,Disappointing!,"Having spent time holidaying in the Wicklow area the previous summer we decided to stay at this hotel the night before we flew out from Dublin on our Honeymoon in May 2015.  Having booked the Hotel as our first night of our Honeymoon and having left a note with the booking to indicate this I was surprised to find that not one member of staff (especially reception) offered a congratulations or recognised the fact we had chosen the hotel to celebrate a big occasion.
Having worked in the luxury hotel industry I was more than disappointed that they dropped the ball on what was a quiet Monday night after a Bank Holiday weekend.  The hotel location and decor is stunning but no atmosphere or personality and absolutely nothing to warrant a return visit.

",2,2015,07,10
217,Powerscourt Hotel simply amazing!,"Powerscourt definitely exceeded expectation. Staff ...friendly and professional.
The mountain view room was spectacular. We are so lucky we stayed here to relax. It has all the amenities you need ( 2 restaurants, spa, pool, fitness center etc)  and  a walk to the highly rated Powerscourt  garden. 

This is one of our favorite hotels in Europe. 
Cannot wait to go back.",5,2015,07,09
217,Absolutely FABULOUS hotel,"My husband and I stayed here on 7/7/15 to celebrate our 25th wedding anniversary and it was just like stepping into a world of luxury. We stayed on the 4th floor with a mountain view and the scenery is spectacular. Our room was huge with a walk- in wadrobe area and a fabulous bathroom. The pool area is very sleek and done in black marble with wonderful changing room facilities. Eimear on reception added a lovely touch by leaving a tray with little treats and a card to mark the occasion of our anniversary which made it all extra-special for us.We were late eating as the pool was too tempting so we ate in McGill's Irish bar on the 3rd floor and the staff were so helpful and friendly and food was delicious even at 10pm. We couldn't hear a sound from our bedroom which is incredible for a hotel of this size. We had a lovely breakfast in the restaurant with amazing views of the Sugarloaf mountain and finished off our amazing stay with a last visit to the pool and steam room. This is without doubt one of the most luxurious hotels we have stayed in and the staff are so lovely, especially Eimear on reception. We would highly recommened a visit to Powerscourt Hotel and we cannot wait to go back.",5,2015,07,08
217,Loved Powerscourt!,"We were visiting the Dublin area, but didn't want to be in downtown. Powerscourt is located about 30 minutes south of Dublin near Bray. It is luxurious and very hospitable. The grounds are extremely luxurious with rolling hills looking at Sugarloaf Mountain. The Irish think it's a mountain but from a Seattlelite perspective it is lovely hill. The Golf Course and Powerscourt gardens are immaculate and inviting. The pool is probably one of the nicest I've ever seen, and the workout amenities are second to none.

We absolutely loved the hotel, the customer service and the food.",4,2015,07,08
217,One of my best experience in Ireland,"Powercourt hotel is a peaceful and relaxing place in a very old garden. It is much worth the detour ! We were lucky to have an upgrade and our room was about 70 square meters! He had a huge kitche, a dining room with comfortable and luxury furtinures, a separated bedroom with the biggets and most comfortable bed ever and a gorgeous marble bathroom with bath and shower. We also had the pleasure to have access to a balcony with a view on the gardens. Service was perfect and the breakfast buffet was delicious. I highly recommend this place for a quiet romantic weekend and some spa treats!",5,2015,07,08
217,Truly magnificent modern hotel and spa,"This is without a doubt the most magnificent modern hotel I have visited in Europe. The quality of build, spaciousness and sumptuous decor are very impressive.

However, service is only good. Oddly the boys on concierge were the best of the lot.  Breakfast in the restaurant was pretty average and the take away breakfast prepared for our 5.30am departure abysmal.

But gardens and grounds are fantastic and the rooms - i had a suite - are magnificent. Free bicycles to whizz around grounds and into village. Golf and srately home nearby. Beautiful area.

The spa is wonderful and sports massage by Norbut, a very kind Polish guy, very skilled. He really helped my back. 

Finally -price - with a weak euro against sterling it was the price of a London Premier Inn. STUNNING VALUE.

All together very very good. If they got the food and service better I would say world beating.

217,Beautiful everything,"Stayed here for a work conference and thought the hotel was absolutely stunning. My room was top quality and I couldn't have wished for better.
Had a walk around the grounds and enjoyed the view of the rolling fields and woods. Used the gym facilities which were more than adequate.",5,2015,07,07
217,Luxury,"Stayed recently while going to wedding at Powerscourt House  . Got early check in and upgrade to Garden Room.  Rooms are large. Real 5 star. Separate Toilet to bathroom 
Ensure that you include breakfast in a stay.  Expensive but excellent.  Great Eggs Benedict    Did not eat in Sika restaurant.  
Excellent  pool ,and Turkish style Steam Room 
Bar a disappointment.  Very dark , not very welcoming in the summer.",5,2015,07,07
217,Live like a king and queen while staying on the emerald isle!,"What can I say, just a magnificent facility!  Were were put in this lovely suite on the top floor with a giant private balcony with incredible views of the gardens.  Arriving late at night, we found ourselves greeted with warm scones and fresh fruits when we entered the room, as well as warmed robes and light classical music playing in the background.

There for a wedding, we did not get as much time as we would have like to enjoy the resort; make sure you find a way to stay there for at least 2-3 days and pamper yourself!",5,2015,07,06
217,The Inspiration for Many poets,"One of the best places to be for a perfect vacation. Beautiful property, we stayed in a suite, with a view of the sugar loaf mountains. Very good indoor swimming pool and spa. Lovely, classic scenery around, lush green, many activities to do.",5,2015,07,04
217,Nice hotel,"Must go if you like nature and just want to relax. You can go for a walk in the garden, along the river, in the forest and many other places. Hotel room is big and people are friendly. It is about 45mins drive from Dublin city",4,2015,07,03
217,Beautiful countryside estate setting,"The Powerscourt Hotel is only about a half hour from Dublin and is located on an amazing estate and golf course.  The room was plush, very large and clean and new. The only negative was the taxi situation.  The front desk calls the taxi for you.  The taxi takes 15 minutes to get to you and if the front desk is busy, the taxi comes and goes without you.  I had to jump in a taxi with another hotel guest who was gracious enough to offer me a ride in his taxi.  All in, the Powerscourt Hotel has free WiFi, (It is so aggravating when hotels charge for WiFI) the people were very friendly and the hotel was clean and the rooms were spacious.  I would recommend this hotel to anyone who wants to relax in a beautiful environment.",5,2015,07,03
217,Lovely Powerscourt,"My husband and I stayed at Powerscourt for two nights at the end of our 11 day Irish vacation.  We were looking for a spot to relax at the end of a very active 9 days.  The hotel is beautiful and the rooms were very luxurious. We had a standard king room and it was huge with a great bathroom.  The hotel grounds are very pretty and within a short walking distance of the Powerscourt Estate and Gardens.  The estate has been covered to inside stores and a cafe that overlook the amazing gardens which are worth a tour.  My husband played a round of golf at the Powerscourt Golf Club and said it was top notch.  We had dinner at the hotel in the SIKA restaurant  and it was very very good.  We did not use the spa.  What I would tell you is that this a very much a place to relax.  There is the village in Enniskerry within driving distance but it is very small.  I would tell you two days here are about all you need.  I would also say that there were lots of small children with their families during our stay.  Now we love children, don't get us wrong.  However, it you are looking for a romantic getaway I would just be aware that this is a family friendly hotel.  In fact, the night we had dinner at SIKA which, as I said, was excellent, there was a family several tables down with children in strollers.  I have mixed feelings about that type of dining experience.  I don't want to make someone with children uncomfortable but this was a later evening dinner that was pricey and was meant to be a special occasion.  The family with the children were lovely but babies so what babies do so there were loud noises.  Just something to think about, it may not bother you but then it may.  ",4,2015,07,02
217,Classy Hotel in a superb location,"The view from our room looked out upon Sugar Loaf mountain in the Wicklow Hills. This description will not do the view justice as the view was framed by woodland to the right and left and immaculately sculpted gardens to the foreground. The photos online might give you an idea. If you are going for a special occasion, opt for the Mountain view room. 
I brought Mrs M here for her birthday surprise. we stayed with our daughter and with the help of the Hotel staff, managed to get a baby-sitter so we could have a romantic meal. 
There were loads of nice touches which qualified the five stars beyond doubt; from the welcome notes, to the service at the bar and restaurant; everything runs very smoothly and the staff are professional and confident in their various roles.
I'm Irish and the reputation of this hotel preceded my visit. Now that I've stayed here, I can honestly say that I can't think of a better location or a better hotel in this part of the country.",5,2015,07,01
217,fabulous stay for a special occasion,"We stayed here, with our 7 month old,for 1 night to celebrate my husbands 30th birthday. We arrived early, our room was not available but we had full use of the hotel facilities while we waited. The staff were very friendly and helpful especially bringing our luggage to and from the car as we had quite a few bits when travelling with a baby!
The room itself was very spacious, plenty of room for the travel cot, buggy etc. A huge comfy bed and fabulous bathroom with a rain shower and separate bath. We also had a lovely balcony, even though it overlooked the car park there was beautiful views of the woodland area surrounding the hotel.
The swimming pool was gorgeous and had a huge jacuzzi. It also had beautiful loungers around the pool. We took our baby for her first ever swim here and she loved it too!
We ate in Sika that evening, we were a little nervous about bringing our 7 month old to the restaurant but our server Bobo was excellent. She was really helpful, friendly attentive and brilliant with our daughter. The food was excellent, very tasty . The staff were also kind enough to personalise a dessert for my husbands birthday.
We had breakfast in bed the following morning and took a stroll around the hotel gardens which brought to an end a fabulous but all too short of stay at this truly 5 star hotel",5,2015,06,30
217,Luxury Escape Just 30 Minutes from Dublin,"After walking miles each day through hills and alleys in the two weeks leading up to our Powerscourt Hotel escape, this was just what the travel doctor ordered. Although Marriott probably defines luxury in the size of the suites (huge), the digitally controlled temperature & lighting (unnecessary) and the flat screens in every room (including the bathroom, luxury to us was the unbelievably comfortable king sized bed, cocoon of quiet, coed steam room, beautiful pools, free bikes, generous breakfast buffet (salmon and cheese, yes!) and ABOVE ALL the stunning setting. We encourage an evening ride into Enniskerry for dinner and a stop along the way  home to watch the horses by the road overlooking the Great Sugarloaf Mountain. We did not have a mountain view room, but it might be worth the investment. Don't miss riding over to the Garden in the morning. Not to miss! We loved the young staff who helped with the bikes and ride to town for our bus back to Dublin.",4,2015,06,30
217,Excellence in every aspect.,"My company recently hosted a European Medical Imaging meeting at the Powerscourt Hotel, Enniskerry.
From the very first contact with the event organizers and managers right through to the reception,concierge, restaurant, bar and porter staff the service was excellent, the best I have ever experienced. The friendliness and efficiency of everyone would be hard to match. Every one of our visitors from Finland to Greece and Ireland to the Ukraine were extremely impressed with the quality and service of this hotel. The hotel is a genuine 5 star hotel in every aspect. The building is amazing in its quality and location, in the Powerscourt Estate. The rooms are excellent, the view over the Sugar Loaf is beautiful, the beds are the most comfortable I have slept in outside of America. The bar is cozy and welcoming (Ian did an wonderful job in looking after our visitors - sometimes late in to the night!!). The restaurant is also excellent where the staff were so efficient and friendly and the food is first class. Our visitors were particularly impressed with the facilities including the spa and the grounds with an amazing amount of beautiful walks for jogging and romantic walks. The golf courses are excellent, some of us played the East Course one of the finest golf courses in Ireland. We have received wonderful praise from our visitors to Ireland and l and I feel this is  mostly due to their experience of this fine hotel.",5,2015,06,30
217,brilliant hotel with beautiful scenery,"really nice hotel, highly recommend staying here, the rooms are lovely, the atmosphere in the hotel is very relaxing. The breakfast was really good. The grounds and walks around the hotel are gorgeous. Cant wait to get back to stay again!",5,2015,06,30
217,Best hotel in Ireland?,"This is our 4th time at this wonderful hotel. This really is  a 5* oasis in the Wicklow hills.
We always stay in a mountain view suite on the 6th floor, it never disappoints. Try it for the experience, you will not be disappointed.
It was our anniversary on this occasion and we were surprised with a little gift in our room. It was a really nice touch and very enjoyable.
The staff are excellent and all very helpful and eager to please. Nothing is too much trouble. We did not eat in the Sika restaurant on this occasion, but based on previous visits it is excellent. The breakfast room has recently had a facelift, which makes it more pleasurable with better views over the wonderful gardens. The breakfast has a wonderful array of food to suit all palates and tastes.

If you have not been there before, treat yourself to a visit, it will be a memory to cherish.",5,2015,06,30
217,weekend break at powers court hotel,"Powerscourt is a 5 star hotel that is 5 star. When you go to Spain thinking you are going to a 5 star hotel only to find that you are booked into a 3 star (if you're lucky), well The Powerscourt Hotel will not let you down.  It is 5 star all over.  The grounds are spectacular; the staff are amazingly wonderful and friendly and helpful; and the restaurants are or should be Michelin star grade.  Then there is the rooms.  Wow!  They too are spectacular even to the extent of having a TV embedded in a mirror.  The bed is the most comfortable hotel bed I have ever slept in.  There is nothing ordinary about this beautiful hotel or the grounds.  I can't speak highly enough about the Powerscourt Hotel and grounds.",5,2015,06,29
217,It's all about the view,"We stayed here to spoil ourselves and celebrate our wedding anniversary.  We had a superior double with a beautiful view across the Wicklow Mountains to the Sugar Loaf.

Everything about the hotel is perfect, the garden and the public areas are beautifully maintained, our room was lovely - huge spaces with a walk-in wardrobe, enormous bathroom with his/hers sinks, a TV in the mirror (although the aspect ratio was off), big bath, fantastic shower.  Lights, aircon etc are all controlled from little consoles built into the bedside units.  Very clever.  All in all very happy.

We enjoyed the pool area although it was a little noisy with a lot of kids messing about, so we availed of the Serenity Room in the ESPA spa, which was extremely peaceful and relaxing.

We opted to have dinner in McGill's Bar (reviewed separately) as my wife had eaten in the Restaurant a few weeks ago and wanted something a little more laid back and relaxed.

After dinner we had drinks in the lobby - unfortunately there was no Amaretto.  No offer was made to check the other bars or the restaurant for stock and no indication was made of having done so - which, for a five star, is a little disappointing. While having a drink there we took in how beautiful the lobby is, the chandeliers in the form of hot air balloons for example.  One thing what was a little out of kilter however were the tables (or at least the one we were sitting at) which was a poor reproduction of an antique, having drawer handles but not actually having drawers.  A very odd touch.

We had a very restful night of sleep in our extremely comfortable bed and having enjoyed a swim and a Jacuzzi to blow away the cobwebs we had an amazing breakfast, served on the terrace outside.  There's a great selection and service was very good.

All in all, we enjoyed it and will definitely return and recommend to others.  My only regret was not bringing my gym gear as the gym looks absolutely fantastic!",4,2015,06,29
217,Beautiful hotel pity about the staff,We visited this hotel this afternoon for what we hoped would be a leisurely lunch. Unfortunately what we experienced was snobbery and apathy. When you initially walk through the doors of the hotel it really is stunning and the floral displays are very well done. However we went to sit in the Sugar Loaf lounge which is a lounge in the main entrance area and we were advised that they reserved this area for overnight guests. We explained that we would like to order lunch and were told that we could make our way to the bar downstairs. More in shock than in agreement we duly made our way to the bar. While the staff were lovely the atmosphere was not conducive to a leisurely lunch as the hotel were hosting an event and there was a lot of noise. The seats were hard and there was no where to relax. We then went to purchase a voucher as a gift and were greeted by a less than friendly attitude. Having stayed in many really lovely 5 star hotels around Ireland I was really disappointed by our experience. We are attending a wedding in the hotel later this month and are staying for 2 nights however based on our experience today we really aren't as excited as were. Fingers crossed the staff might learn the value of appreciating all customers and not just the overnight guests before then !!,2,2015,06,28
217,Worth every penny,"Arrived on the Sunday for a two night stay.
From the moment I arrived I felt pampered and in the height of luxury .
I had room 547 which was at the front and not facing the fountain or mountain however , the room was beautiful.
Two Queen size beds, large desk, comfy armchair with foot rest, flat screen TV side lockers and the normal lamps etc.
Small dressing room with lots of cupboards with built in lights, a safe, full size ironing board with iron. Voltage adaptor, shoe horn and clothes brush. Slippers and bathrobe .
Now the bathroom, huge big bath, separate marble shower, separate WC, massive mirror with built in TV above two sinks and marble everywhere .
I had afternoon Tea which was wonderful, dinner which was the best.
Breakfast was noting like I had ever seen before. Plates and plates of fresh fruit. Lots of different juices, hot food, and a wonderful little gadget, a pancake maker.
Two pancakes in less then a minuet.
Staff! Well what can I say. It was like spending time with old friends.
Would I come back? Without a doubt .",5,2015,06,26
217,Stunning hotel with average customer service,"My husband and I stayed one night to celebrate our first year anniversary in June. Had high expectations, and having stayed in Druid's Glen a few months earlier where it was exceptional from start to finish, I was expecting the same standard from Powerscourt. 

The good - had an amazing room with stunning views and the grounds are wonderful to explore. The service is where the hotel falls short, no welcome or greeting at the spa, impatient housekeeping staff knocking and ringing, then entering our room a few seconds later, deserts sent up to the room without napkins or cutlery, charged for water from the mini-bar that we didn't drink post-checkout, and only one receptionist on duty during checkout despite numerous staff members in the vicinity. And unlike Druid's Glen who contacted us a week before our stay to ask what time we wanted to book our table for dinner, I had to initiate contact with Powerscourt and waited 4 days for a reply. Not what I expect from a hotel at this price point.",3,2015,06,25
217,Wonderful experience,"We booked our stay for three nights as just a short break away in order to relax after a tough week. I cannot fault this hotel. Amazing staff, amazing views!
The food is to die for, i highly recommend the Sika restaurant. Although any food had here is just excellent. 
The giant chess board is like something out of a Harry Potter book, this hotel is just magical.
Just a utterly peaceful bit of heaven waiting to be experienced, I do not have one bad word about this hotel and we will be back.",5,2015,06,24
217,Elegance at its best,"We stayed here on the bank holiday weekend! We had a fabulous room with a balcony! From the moment we stepped in and met Niamh on reception we instantly knew we would be looked after! We had dinner in the bistro and it was delicious, could do with more choice on the menu however. Staff were very attentive. We went to the bar and it lacked the same attentjon that would be my only criticism. 
All in all we found the hotel elegant and beautiful! Thank you ",5,2015,06,22
217,Enjoyable stay in the country but not too far away from sites,"We Visited the Powerscourt Hotel after several traveling days and enjoyed the peace and quite. The atmosphere was sophisticated and relaxed we enjoyed several drinks in the lobby bar and dinner in the restaurant as well as the pool and sauna and facilities were so relaxing that we wished we would have booked more time here. 

Would I go back - absolutely! 

The hotel is a bit away from Bray but not too far for an afternoon visit. There is a world renowned Garden nearby and Ireland's highest waterfall near by as well as a golf course to entertain you. 

The near by village as also worth a stop at one of the little Cafes for breakfast.

All and all a perfect spot for some much needed R&R.

They even upgraded our room and it was probably as big as our first apartment. The bathroom was great with shower and a nice soaking tub with a tv built into the mirror to sit back and relax in the tub with some tv or music.",5,2015,06,22
217,Wicklow Wonderland,"Staying for 10 days in Wicklow was made even better by the hotel we chose. 
When we arrived Robbie took us to our suite on the sixth floor, which was the most beautiful suite I have stayed in so far, with lounge, large bedroom and not one but two bathrooms (one for any guests you may have), plus walk in wardrobe. The view from the balcony was beautiful especially when the sun shone (and it did thankfully).
The cleanliness of the room hits you as you walk in, and was kept that way throughout our stay by the hardworking house-keepers.
You we're spoilt for choice at breakfast time and certainly wouldn't go hungry with such an array of goodies. We ate in the Sugar Loaf Lounge, Sika and room service and were satisfied with all of them.
I wish to thank Tara and Margareta for their consideration, and hope they get a pat on the back for putting guests before their own convenience.
The interior is old world class, rather than club chaired boutique, and looks wonderful.
I don't usually like 5 star hotels that are part of a large organisation, as I feel you lose some of the intimacy, however, the staff were a credit to the hotel, friendly, helpful and professional.
The lounge could be a tad chilly some days with the doors open all day - just bring a cardigan with you. And I did miss a doorman not being there on arrival, but then I am being a bit picky.
There are plenty of places to visit within easy reach of the hotel or further afield depending whether you wish to tour or relax and the concierge will help with any planning if needs be.
We enjoyed our wonderful stay at Powerscourt and look forward to returning soon.",4,2015,06,21
217,Wonderful,"I've loved every minute staying here and don't want to leave. The suite is spectacular , the Spa, the restaurant , the location and the wonderful staff. The food is amazing and the fabulous scenery. Sooo relaxing, can't wait to come back. Love love love it. ",5,2015,06,21
217,Room and location wonderful-food a little dissapointing.,"The hotel itself and the staff did not disappoint, both were wonderful. The dinner however was little bit of a let down-so much mousse!!! A little more actual food is needed. We enjoyed breakfast however and room was a real treat.",4,2015,06,20
217,"A big, classy hotel that delivers on multiple counts","Powerscourt surprised me on the upside. Having just been to Gleneagles I expected a sort of lesser version of a big resort hotel but for me it was much better. This is a large, classy and modern hotel that sits in a sublime position overlooking Dublin's mountains. My room was excellent - a large suite with an extremely comfy bed, good-sized sitting room and and a massive dressing room and bathroom. All the meals we had were excellent and the in-hotel pub was a huge success and lots of fun. Whilst i didn't play golf, my friends that did all enjoyed a well-kept parkland course with fast greens. The staff were universally attentive and professional.",5,2015,06,20
217,Beautiful suite with an amazing view.,"For the most part our stay was excellent.
We were provided with a beautiful room with a stunning view of the mountains.
On arrival the bar staff were extremely professional and courteous as were the reception staff.
My girlfriend used the spa which she was really impressed with.
We dined in the restaurant, the food and service were excellent.

There were however some issues with the staff.
My girlfriend was spoken to quite badly by a member of the spa staff.
They kept insisting she was late for her 14:45 appointment, though this was not the case.
She was on-time for her 15:00, in fact she arrived 15 minutes early for it.

The restaurant tried to charge us for 3 course meals, though we had only had 2 course meals.
This was an honest mistake.

A member of staff entered the room without knocking 3 times, once coming into the bathroom while I was using it.
Another member of staff walked entered the room without knocking, to replenish tea supplies.

These incidents detracted from an otherwise entirely pleasuable stay.
The fact that my girlfriend was spoken to badly left a particularly bad taste.",4,2015,06,17
217,Stunning hotel in a beautiful location,"Would thoroughly recommend a suite with mountain view and balcony if you're looking for a special treat. The photos don't do it justice! The suite was huge complete with kitchen. Instead of eating out one evening we decided to pick up some lovely local meats and cheeses from the village and cook up a feast looking out over the fantastic view! 
The spa is beautiful and so relaxing- perfect after a long walk (many to choose from) in the local area. You can also get bikes free of charge from the hotel which is ideal if you're there without a car as it's a bit of trek down to the village.
Would recommend the afternoon tea served in the sumptuous sugar loaf lounge. Service was faultless wherever we were in the hotel. A perfect couple of days away in luxurious surroundings!",5,2015,06,17
217,Gracious relaxation,"We had a wonderful suite with a walk-in closet, living room, bathroom with a walk-in shower and separate tub.  There was a TV imbedded in the mirror over the sinks - neat touch!  The pub on the lowest level of the hotel was fun and the food was very good.  The swimming pool and hot tub are not to be missed.  They are SO relaxing and the temperatures are just right.  The grounds of the resort are wonderful for walking and enjoying the area.  We caught a ride into Enniskerry and had a fun time walking around town.  We decided to walk back, although the hotel offers free transportation each way.  Can't wait to come back!",5,2015,06,13
217,haven of tranquility,"This is a wonderful hotel located about 40Km from Dublin airport in a beautiful parklike setting.  The 2-room suites are gorgeous with a view of the spiky sugarloaf mountain. Service is impeccable and the hotel can arrange tours of the countryside close by.  I recommend a visit to Glendalough ""the valley of the two lakes"" with great scenery and the ruins of an old Abbey dating back to the 9th century (see the round tower!).
Another nice tour is Sally Gap and the Louch Tay a beautiful little lake where the filming of TV's ""Vikings"" is taking place.  Eat at the Sika restaurant at level 3 - try their beautiful sea bass.  Breakfast is a well stocked buffet.",5,2015,06,13
217,Class,"We booked a mountain suite just for the views and it didn't disappoint, the suite was grand in size with walk in wardrobe, sitting room and a bathroom that was enough to fit 10 people in it at the same time .

Touchscreen technology to adjust lights air conditioner in all rooms was a nice feature, and can't forget the TV screen in mirror in the bathroom. 

The location of hotel was lovely, plenty of places to go for walks around the hotel, we were only staying for one night, so we choose the house of gardens to spend the day in and what a place to spend a few hours in. After the walk we went to the cafe and took in the views and relaxed. 

That evening we went to McGills for food and found the food to be delightful and reasonable priced. 

After a goodnights sleep as it was very quite, we ordered breakfast up to room and the breakfast didn't disappoint either. 

Overall, couldn't fault our stay in any way, wished we could have stayed longer and next time we will be doing just that as there is plenty more this hotel can offer that we didn't get around too.",5,2015,06,12
217,Mr Derek  Murphy,Quaint old building. The bar is teaming with old style nostalgic aura. The selection of beers is varied and served with a warm smile and the atmosphere is jovial created by the staff. The food and service in The Grapevine  Restaurant is surely deserving of the  highest accolade that can be bestowed on the restaurant. The menu is varied and has a dish or two to cater for everyone's taste. You won't be disappointed by a visit. I for one will be returning. More than once  I can assure you of that.. Visit and  enjoy. ,5,2015,06,10
217,Outstanding property,"Autograph Collection properties never disappoint and Powerscourt Hotel is no exception. Lovely accommodations and gardens, excellent dining options and a most gracious staff. The drive in is a bit daunting but the arrival is worth the trip.",5,2015,06,10
217,Big expectation and not disappointed!!,"I had visited Powerscourt on business a couple of times in the past whilst it was under the Ritz Carlton name but up until recently I had not had the pleasure of staying and enjoying this beautiful property. One could easily assume that with the big names this property was once associated with leaving for pastures anew that it might be to its detriment but that is clearly not the case here! 

Powerscourt has all the attributes of a large international hotel but manages to create a unique Irish service offering and atmosphere which is hard to find these days.

Treating ourselves, we stayed for 3 days and were not bothered with leaving the hotel or its environs. We were content to utilise the hotel and its facilities to their full extent and we were not disappointed.

The staff were professional and efficient yet friendly and relaxed. The food was really very good all round with the highlight being Sika restaurant for dinner. We frequented the ESPA during our stay and it lived up to its reputation, friendly obliging staff and world class facilities. 

Nothing during our stay was a problem and whilst that might be assumed staying in a five star hotel it can very often not be case. We would wholeheartedly recommend Powerscourt Hotel and look forward to our return someday next year.",5,2015,06,10
217,RELAX IN STYLE.,"Brings a New Meaning to RELAXATION.

My  wife and I stayed here last weekend in one of their suites which was absolutely fabulous.  In all the places I've stayed I have never seen the tv screen in the bathroom as part of the mirror!   The room as spotless and was facing the fountain and gardens and sugarloaf mountain.  We ate in the Sika restaurant where the food and the service were truly 5 stars.  I would highly recommend this gorgeous hotel just South of Dublin City.  One thing -and this is for the architects/designers rather than the management and staff - for a hotel which prides and sells itself on the spectacular views I found that the cross bar of the windows (which is quite wide) is directly in front of your face as you stand on the floor and look out the window! So you crouch down to look out or stand up on the window sill - I am of average adult height.  But DO NOT let this put you off staying here.",5,2015,06,05
217,Discovery Experience,"Visited hotel for business and my general experience is very positive.

Reception is friendly and fast.

Rooms are extra big and great. My room unfortunately did not nice view.

Restaurant is good but has no capacity to serve big group of people in short time.  Food is so tasty, enjoyed so much.

Business area is all you need.

WiFi is good in whole hotel.
",4,2015,06,04
217,An absolute gem,"Absolutely gorgeous hotel in all aspects - the sales staff were incredibly helpful, reception staff were welcoming. The food was absolutely incredible with George providing matched wines. Our bedrooms were huge, with fantastic views and all the extra amenities you could wish for. Our spa treatments were brilliant and again, gorgeous facilities with brilliant staff. Special mention for Lauren who did my manicure, she was fantastic. 

I can't wait to return to this beautiful property",5,2015,06,04
217,Wedding,"Absolutely stunning. Beautiful hotel and grounds. Will definitely be back our visit was too short. Stunning scenery and grounds. Very picturesque. 

Beautiful bedrooms, extremely spacious. Lovely breakfast. Stayed for one night but would recommend longer. ",5,2015,06,04
217,"Fabulous venue, great service, real 5 star experience!","treated to an overnight in a suite as a special gift ... we were blown away by the standard of everything, from the reception through to all aspects of the suite.  From the spacious dressingroom with loads of hanging space and accommodation to unpack two suitcases at once, to the fabulous bathroom with the most comfortable bath I think I've ever been in, including a TV inset to the mirror... the sittingroom had lots of comfortable seating as well as a desk and TV.  Through sliding doors, the bedroom had 2 double beds which were divinely comfortable.   We did visit the spa which was subterranean, but they had been booked out and unfortunately there were quite a few small kids in the pool and jacuzzi so we skipped the experience. We dined in the Sika restaurant, which was excellent if a little lacking in atmosphere.  A really enjoyable experience all round.",5,2015,06,03
217,The perfect retreat,"Stayed here recently for our anniversary. I must say a truly beautiful hotel ideally located in the mountains with beautiful scenery and waterfalls in the area. What made this place so special was we did have a mix up with the spa as they couldn't find out booking made many months prior but this caused no hassle to the hotel, they simple got us slightly different treatments and didn't charge us a penny. Very helpful abc accommodating. A must stay for anyone looking a romantic get away for a special occasion.",5,2015,06,03
217,"Serene and Effortless, with a touch of class","I stayed 3 nights over a weekend. I was in Dublin for the Foo Fighters concert at Slane Castle, which although a good hour's drive away did not put me off staying at Powerscourt. 
I've stayed at Marriott hotels all over the world and this has to be one of, if not the best. 
It's set in private grounds about 30 minutes to the south of Dublin. It's mainly know for its golf courses and stunning views over the Wicklow mountains. 
It has a real boldness and scale which makes it a very comfortable and serene place. Even when busy - as it was the weekend I stayed - you don't get a sense its full of people. The service is excellent if a little too laid back at times and the food is sensational in the main restaurant. Highly recommended as a base for discovering the eastern side of Ireland, even if you don't play golf.",4,2015,06,02
217,"Lovely hotel, not so lovely views","First, the bad - the hotel is built into the side of a hill with a ring of tall trees around back, so ""Mountain view"" means ""view of the lawn"" unless you're on the top floor or two and ""Resort view"" means ""view of a retaining wall"" unless you're on the top floor.  Even with Gold Elite status, we ended up on the 3rd floor and were quite disappointed with the view.  Also, the touch screens in the rooms work very poorly; for me this meant no heating and no bedroom lights.  My niece informed me late in the visit that pounding on the screens works best; your mileage may vary.  Other than these issues, the hotel was wonderful - meals were uniformly excellent; restaurant, spa, and front desk service were flawless; the staff was quick to offer guidance and directions whenever we asked, and the pool was amazing.  Sika deserves special mention - my family was dazzled that our server remembered our drink order after day 1.  Bit of the Ritz playbook still in evidence here.  If you're not going for the view, I would highly recommend the Powerscourt.",4,2015,06,02
217,Decent stay but disappointed at reception's hostility,"Stayed with my wife and young children recently as a quick getaway. As a guest who has previously stayed here, it was clear to see that the hotel has downgraded. Not as luxurious as it once was, but still does the job for a quick break. The issues myself and my wife had was the rude and hostile nature with certain members of the staff, particularly with the managers at reception. Whenever we raised a question with reception regarding our children, we were always met with a dismissive response as if everything was an inconvenience. We wouldn't consider the spa pool entirely suitable for children either, as the pool itself is black and the dim lighting makes everything less visible. However, the spa were always on hand and due to their kindness, we had an enjoyable time, so thank you. However, don't expect anything to be cheap. The hotel's prices are not value for money so consider wisely before you book. Yet on a last note, we would like to thank two members of staff, Furella from housekeeping and Sarah from room service who were extremely helpful. Both came to our room more than once and were incredibly courteous every single time. Furella never batted an eyelid with respect to an issue with our children and didn't dispute any request that we gave her, unlike reception. We ordered three times from room service in the evening and we were greatly appreciative that Sarah had the cop on to knock quietly on the door instead of ringing the bell the last time as we ordered some wine after finally putting our children to bed. Both were never without a smile even though we kept both on their toes (sorry!) and they truly reflect good customer service. For that they have brought this review up from a 3 star to a 4 star!",4,2015,06,02
217,Great hotel,"Had a great 2 day stay in rm 641.  Beautiful deluxe room with king size bed, exceptional closet, sitting area, gorgeous bathroom suite and large balcony. The staff was very friendly, helpful and efficient. The pub had great food- and the afternoon tea was lovely. The location is perfect for visiting powerscourt gardens, waterfall, dublin and glendalough. Look for the labyrinth in the front courtyard.  

The breakfast was outstanding- down to the self-serve pancake cooker! :-)

The only negative was the overpriced Cava. We ordered proSecco in the pub- they served a Cava that was too sweet and came in at 81euro. Gave 3/4 of the bottle to the wait staff (who didn't offer to take it off the bill ...btw). 

Don't let that put you off, though, it was otherwise a fabulous weekend stay. 

",5,2015,05,31
217,Good but a few little issues,"We enjoyed our stay, location is fantastic but there were a few things that bugged and really shouldn't happen in a five star hotel. On arrival the guy took our bags to be brought to our room, forty minutes later they still hadn't arrived even though I had called front desk twice. As we were only down for one night we wanted to explore the area and felt frustrated at having to sit waiting for so long. We had dinner in the restaurant which was beautiful although all three of us felt let down by the desserts which were not up to the same standard as the starters and main course and at 10 euro each should have been better. If you fancy something sweet and delicious try avoca in  powercourt estate half the price and much nicer. My final little gripe was regarding a member of staff in the bar who after serving another customer an irish coffee proceeded to lick the spoon! Disgusting, I only hope she washed it after. Generally the hotel is nice but when a hotel has five stars my expectations are high.",4,2015,05,31
217,Perfect Place for Visits to Powerscourt Gardens,"We were looking for a place in Wicklow near the famous and beautiful Powerscourt Gardens, and this hotel fit the bill nicely.  It is immediately next door.   A former Ritz Carlton, the hotel shows that it has aged a bit since it was unveiled in 2007 and it is a notch below a true luxury hotel.  Still, we had a spacious suite with a luxurious bath (complete with heated floor) at a decent rate of 280 Euros (with breakfast).  The staff could not have been nicer, and even provided rides in the house car to the village and for a short ride to the garden.  There is a lovely spa and a golf course. The restaurant was very good at breakfast and dinner.  The views from the hotel across the Wicklow countryside to the mountain are great.  There is nothing particularly Irish about the hotel (except for the hospitable staff) so if you are looking for rural charm, this is not the place for you.  But, as stated, if you want a comfortable lodging adjacent to the Powerscourt Estate, the hotel is perfect.",4,2015,05,31
217,Have already planned my second visit...,"Excellent Location outside Dublin. Quick drive to/from city, and perfectly set within the Wicklow Mountains. The estate grounds are vast with lots to take in during your stay. Do not overlook the spa, or you'll have unknowingly deprived yourself. The signature shillelagh stick massage was a pure treat and the Swarovski pool and thermal suite was truly a highlight on our trip to Ireland. While at the spa we decided to make this trip again next year.",5,2015,05,30
217,Perfect experience!,"Probably the best hotel I have been in recent years, a luxurious resort set in a beautiful landscape. Very friendly Staff, rooms are very spacious and very clean. Everything exudes luxury and good taste.
Superb SPA center and well equipped fitness room.
Excellent breakfast with many options to choose from. There is also an Irish specific pub inside the hotel, with extended hours in the evenings.
I recommend to ride a bycicle through the neighborhood, it's a memorable experience. You can find free bycicles out front.",5,2015,05,30
217,Like Something out of a Movie,"My friend and I arrived in Enniskerry wondering how we were going to get to the resort. I went into the the Powerscourt Arms (no affilliation) and they called the resort directly to get a car for us.  This resort is unlike any other I have ever stayed in.  The hotel is situated in a forest in the Wicklow mountains.  Driving up to it, I felt like I was in a fairytale.  Our suite had a mountain view.  The staff were incredibly attentive to our every need.  The spa and pool were impeccable.  High Tea was delicious.   I do not have a single negative thing to say about this place, except that I wish I could still be there right now.

If you ever get an opportunity to visit Ireland, please take the time to visit this place, even if you cannot stay.  It is truly stunning.",5,2015,05,29
217,Wonderful revisit,"My husband and I arrived at the Powerscourt Hotel highly expectant as we had previously visited in 2012 and had a wonderful time then. The hotel was previously a Ritz-Carlton and the property is still as glossy, but I was concerned that standards of service may have slipped since that branding had gone. 
We had booked a regular guest room and I had requested a mountain view which the hotel were unable to accommodate, however we were upgraded to an enormous suite on the top floor. The suite was exquisite and as I said enormous with a dining area, separate kitchen (with chefs entrance), sitting room and sauna. The provision of the suite probably did probably cloud any impartial view...
The next morning at breakfast it was clear conference guests were abundant, the breakfast provision although generous and of good quality was a bit chaotic due to the number of people trying to eat but all was reasonably well managed and there were just enough staff to deal with the numbers. Staff were cheerful and seemed engaged.
Landscaping at the hotel has clearly been done to a very high standard but maintenance is probably not quite adequate and needs looking at to keep it all tip top. 
We were given a late check out which allowed us a relaxing morning to enjoy coffee in the Sugar Loaf restaurant area which was a great end to our stay there. We didn't eat dinner at the hotel but visited The Fern Restaurant at Avoca nearby which was amazing, I would happily eat every meal at Avoca.
I will very much look forward to another visit to Powerscourt until then I shall be saving so I can enjoy that suite again.",5,2015,05,27
217,Stunning location,This hotel is in the most beautiful location with many activities on the doorstep. While we were there they were renovating the restaurant which caused a bit of upheaval but now it is finished I am sure it will be fine. The rooms are very spacious but with extremely irritating technology. Two hints. Pay the extra for the mountain view and be sure to book a table well in advance if you want dinner at the restaurant.,4,2015,05,27
217,"Wow, beautiful resort in Enniskerry!!","This is one of the nicest places we have ever stayed. We had a mountainview suite with a wonderful balcony overlooking the gardens. Great view of Sugarloaf mt. The suite was huge with a walk-in closet, huge bathroom and nice living room. It was wonderful just to hang out in the room but there was too much to do. You could easily walk to the Powerscourt Gardens or into the village. We had a wonderful lunch in Enniskerry at poppie's--great blue cheese salad. The people in Enniskerry were incredibly friendly and helpful. We walked around a lot, lots of trails throughout the resort, just great. The pub and restaurant onsite were very good, we tried to have drinks in the lobby bar but it was chaotic and had awful service. The resort was less than an hour from Dublin but it really felt like you were in the country.",5,2015,05,26
217,One of the Best Hotels We've Experienced!,"Our short mid-week stay at this hotel was impeccable from beginning to end.  The staff, service and facilities are faultless. We dined at the McGills pub located within the hotel - the Tex Mex sharing platter was some of the best chicken & ribs I've tasted in a long time. The hotel grounds and views are fantastic, we stayed in a Mountain View Suite and found it great value for money.  The wired broadband speed in the room was incredibly fast (and free) considering the hotels location (averaged 40Mbps up/80Mbps down), which helped me get my work done more effectively.",5,2015,05,26
217,Lovely,"Stayed here for 2 nights and the hotel was lovely, staff really friendly and the room was amazing, food was really nice, spent 3 days lounging about in the spa which was really relaxing, would def like to go again",5,2015,05,26
217,Beautiful Hotel,"We recently spent two nights at this hotel to attend a christening of my grandchild in Dublin. The hotel is located on the Powerscourt Estate with stunning views of the Sugarloaf  Mountain. We were met on arrival and given a description of the hotels facilities. The room was one of the largest we had stayed in, with en suite facilities. There was a king sized bed which we found very comfortable. Lighting in the room was controlled from a panel both near the entrance and inside the draw of the bedside table. The air conditioning we thought was noisy but we didn't have need to use it for long.
The bathroom had a walk in shower which was excellent. An unusual feature was the built in television into the bathroom mirror. There was ample supplies of shower gel and shampoo.
There was complimentary coffee and tea making facilities and a fridge with wines and spirits which could be purchased.
The television had the usual free view stations and films were available at a cost. There was also wifi, though we had no need to use it.
I would challenge anyone to use all the storage space with three wardrobes and several drawers. 
The hotel has three eating areas, the Sika Resturant, the Sugarloaf lounge and McGills bar. We attempted to book a meal for eight people in the Sugarloaf Lounge which has three set menus. However each member of our group had preferences from different set menus and this could not be accommodated by the hotel. We found this surprising for a hotel of this quality. In the end we ate in McGills bar which was very cramped. Food though was OK.
Breakfast was taken in the Sika resturant and we thought it to be one of the best we had had in many years of visiting places.
The hotel itself has an excellent swimming pool, hot tub and steam room. Bath robes are available in the bedroom and changing rooms adjacent to the pool have towels and lockers with combination locks. Pool depth is about 4ft 6inches.
The hotel has a number of bikes and it makes a pleasant ride from the hotel down to the river. More difficult returning as it is steeply uphill. We were recommended to go to the Powerscourt Waterfall which is about 4 to 5 miles away and chose to do this in the car. At a cost of about £4-5, there is a private road to it, it is well worth seeing, it being the highest waterfalls in Ireland.
We would stay in the hotel again but a greater range of courses on the dinner menu and a more flexible approach for each member of a group to choose from the separate set menu would be welcomed.",4,2015,05,26
217,Not as good as we had hoped,"My wife and I were really looking forward to our stay at this hotel, having read many of the reviews, but I have to say we were slightly disappointed on a number of fronts.
1st - the room we were initially allocated had no bath - instead it had a really massive shower cubicle but as my wife loves her bath we asked for a move. The room was a disabled room and we were at a loss to understand why it had been allocated to us in the first place as, obviously, others were available.
2nd - we ate in McGills bar on the first night and the meal was ok but found that we had been over charged for our drinks. The matter was corrected without any hassle and we were given another bill.
3rd - we ordered coffee and toast with our breakfast - the coffee arrived quickly enough but we are still waiting for the toast!
4th - when checking out found that we had been charged twice for the meal at McGills.

These are only small points, I know, but this is a 5* hotel and you shouldn't have to put up with these niggly problems.
We found some of the staff to be very helpful and friendly but others less so. The views etc are fantastic and the hotel is spotlessly clean but it certainly isn't the best hotel we have stayed in in Ireland never mind anywhere else.

I think the business with the disabled room at the start of our 2 night stay coloured our impression of the place and I have emphasised the negative points but in all fairness there were plus points too.",4,2015,05,26
217,Stunning Hotel in Beautiful Setting! Pity about the service,"This is one of the most beautiful Hotels I have ever stayed in. The setting (looking out at the great Sugarloaf Mountain) is breath-taking and the design of the hotel makes the most of this - especially the views from the lobby and the Sugar Loaf Lounge / restaurant. For the most part the hotel is well maintained and very clean. The electronic lighting control in our room was broken (on my side of the bed) - so I had to depend on my wife turning on and off my bedside lamp from her side of the bed. A small thing - but not the kind of annoyance I would expect in a 5* Hotel - at these prices.

I found the staff to be well trained and friendly - but nonetheless the service was (in overall terms) a bit poor. For example : The 20 minute queue for check-in (how about a few more staff on the desk?!). At breakfast we had to wait for 40 minutes for two omelettes!!!! On returning to our room on Sunday at 5pm, we found that our room had not been serviced. It took another 45 minutes for them to organise having it done. I managed to get a couple of complimentary drinks from them while we waited - but this was not automatically offered (as it should have been in a 5* hotel).

The service levels probably compare fairly well to other hotels in Ireland. I get the impression that the Hotel staff think that they are doing quite well. The problem, however, is that the service levels do not compare well with Hotels in the USA and many in GB. Most Americans would be horrified! This might be a 5* Hotel - but the service is really only 3* / 4* at a push.

The other big problem is the food and restaurant choice. Powerscourt (while beautiful) is 'out in the sticks'. If you don't want to eat in the hotel there is not much in the way of local alternatives. The Sugar Loaf Restaurant serves good food - but it is very small portions off a very limited menu. McGills bar serves a good selection of 'pub grub'. The quality isn't bad - but wouldn't compare well to most Bistro Pubs across England. For me, there is too big a gap between the high end offering from the Sika and Sugar Loaf Restaurants and McGills Pub. The Hotel needs a Bistro Restaurant with a more extensive Bistro Menu.  We ate in the Hotel for both nights of our stay. I don't know what we would have done for a decent choice on a third night. It would put me off going back.",4,2015,05,26
217,Stunning hotel with all the facilities would would expect,We had a 3 night visit at the hotel in May.  We had a fantastic suite which was enormous.  Breakfast was great and the staff were excellent.  We ate 2 nights in the Pub within the hotel the food was good without being brilliant.,4,2015,05,25
217,Room with a view,"We stayed in a fantastic, decadent corner suite on the 6th floor with sugarloaf views and a wrap around balcony. I don't think I've ever seen a nicer hotel room- double doors with coving everywhere you look, 2 bathrooms, a dressing room, a living and dining room, entrance hall and bedroom. There were a few small drawbacks- the electric curtains didn't work in the bedroom, the shower had to be fixed as there was no pressure in it and the drain had to be unblocked after the shower flooded the entire bathroom although these matters were fixed by maintenance within the hour perfectly. The room itself though was an absolute treat. 
The spa area was great too and the hamman suite will certainly clear your lungs!! Unfortunately kids are allowed into the pool during certain hours of the day and we definitely knew when they arrived!! We left the pool area because of this but it's otherwise a nice spa. 
The restaurant was fully booked that night so we went to Johnny foxes but breakfast the next morning was great. We hit the spa after breakfast and unfortunately before we left we asked if there was a sauna. We were told there was another spa area on the floor above which had a sauna, steam room, jacuzzi etc but cost €25 each. Unfortunately it was a bit late then as we were about to leave but it's a pity it was never mentioned to us the previous day when we had to leave because of the noise. I assume that would resolve the noise issue. 
All in all its a super hotel- stunning views, fantastic rooms and food but not without a few snags.",5,2015,05,24
217,The most wonderful ending to our holiday!,We came across this hotel online and needed somewhere to stay on our last night in Ireland. The Powerscourt was incredible. We managed to get a suite on a lower rate because of a large conference on. We had the most wonderful food in our suite and then enjoyed the Spa until they kicked up out as they were closing! I would definitely recommend this hotel. The staff were wonderful and nothing was too much. Definitely will return.,5,2015,05,24
217,FABULOUS!,"Loved it, very comfortable room and the breakfast was fit for a King!

Their burgers are to die for, very filling, not much room for dessert!!  The dessert is pricy for what you get!

Love the setting and most definitely will be back!

Definitely recommend it!",5,2015,05,24
217,One of Marriott's very best hotels,"We had a marvelous stay at the Powerscourt Hotel.  The hotel is in a most beautiful setting and the beautiful Powerscourt estate is next door -- within walking distance.  There are excellent walking trails and what appeared to be a beautiful golf course.  All of the facilities are first-rate -- fully renovated and brand new.  The rooms are spectacular -- very large with a combination of perfect comfort and technology that's as good as we've seen in any hotel.  Beautiful common areas and restaurants.  Sika in particular is a marvelous restaurant, the best we have visited in Ireland.  The hotel staff was very friendly and willing to please, but with the exception of the wait staff at Sika, not quite as experienced as a hotel of this quality should have.  Nonetheless, we were pleased overall with the service. I highly recommend this hotel and can't wait to return.",5,2015,05,23
217,Beautiful and relaxing!!! ,"I stayed at the Powerscourt Hotel in May 2014. We had a ""Mountain View"" suite and the view was breathtaking. The room was beautiful and clean. The breakfast delicious and I was amazed at all the buffet choices plus the items you could order like the eggs Benedict (which was delicious). We enjoyed dinner, drinks, and live music at the pub one night and found it a wonderful experience. Dinner at the Sugar Loaf Lounge was fantastic. 

I loved the grounds as I took a few hours to walk them and found them beautiful. I also enjoyed walking over to the Estate and touring those grounds as well. I love the fall that you offer complementary bicycles for guests as well. However, I recommend that you invest in some of smaller sizes as I was to short to use them. Instead I took advantage of the complementary car service to and from the village of Enniskerry. 

The concierge was very helpful in helping me find a tour perfect for me and then booked my tour of your beautiful county with Wild Wicklow Tours. 

I absolutely loved staying there and plan on staying again when I being my Mother to Ireland for the first time. ",5,2015,05,20
217,Outstanding!,"This is the best hotel we've ever stayed in.  I use a cane and they were very kind in putting us in a room right off the elevator even though it was a huge upgrade from what we were intended.  They staff were all very gracious and we were so appreciative to Teresa at the front desk for all her help and for Laosie (?) in the cafe dining room on the lobby floor for all her attentive care to us.  The suite we were given was only comparable to the Willard in Washington, D.C. for us, aside from these 2 hotels we've never stayed anywhere nearly as posh.  The food was fabulous, the rooms sparkling, service excellent, hotel absolutely stunning...you simply could not ask for a more excellent place to stay.  My husband was wishing we didn't have to leave--EVER ;)",5,2015,05,20
217,Top notch stay,"This is one of Marriott's finest hotels, without question. It is a true resort.The rooms are wonderful and very comfortable, there are plenty of excitng and peaceful activities near by, and the site makes for a perfect personal or group retreat/vacation.

The rooms had ample space, with both a sitting area and separate bedroom. All of the room was well appointed with great ammenities and decor. The bathoom was very large, with both a tub and shower, a private shower room, private toilet room, and dual sinks. There was a large desk and a full couch in the sitting area. An oversized closet easily fit all of our clothes for a long vacation stay.

The hotel is nearby the Powerscourt House, which is a short walk. This is worth seeing, as you could spend a day touring the grounds. Admission is not included in your hotel stay, but is very inexpensive.

The hotel is a reasonable drive to Dublin. I would not do a regular commute, but you could easily rent a car or hire a driver for a day trip to the city. It is also nearby a very small town that offers a few restaurants, as well as the larger town of Brae only a few miles away. Needless to say, if you run out of dining options at the resort, you can easily find more options nearby. That said, the dining options at the hotel were all superb. As a Marriott Elite, we were offered complimentary full breakfast daily, which was delicious and appreciated.

The hotel grounds themselves are very well maintained. There is not as much to see on the hotel grounds themselves, but since the Powerscourt House is nearby, as well as general walking trails, we had plenty to see outside.

We had an ""early"" check in, which limited our room choices. We would have had a great top-floor hotel if we waited. If you're a Marriott Elite, I recommend waiting for one of the better rooms (not that there is a bad one, but there is a noteable improvement in view and high-floor rooms).",5,2015,05,20
217,Amazing hotel,"Brought the girlfriend for a night away here and fell in love with the place. Absolutely amazing, the rooms are the definition of luxury. Currently saving up for a return trip. Can't wait. It's worth every cent.",5,2015,05,19
217,A grand hotel,"this one really exceeded my expectations.  Can easily be a destination hotel as there is so much to do on the property.  Golf, hike, visit the formal gardens, or play chess with life size game pieces.  The room was lovely.  Very large bathroom and separate dressing room with four closets.  I would suggest that management add a chair or bench to this room.  Also, the property has great shopping.",5,2015,05,19
217,A lovely stay but expected more from 5 star,"Stayed over Easter with my husband, rooms were beautiful however no turn down service or water offered. Bathrooms are amazing especially the mirror TV!
Food in the bar was very good but the Sugar Loaf restaurant was a massive let down. We did bring it to the servers attention but she seemed
Uninterested.
Spa was excellent and treatments very good.",3,2015,05,19
217,Very Enjoyable Overnight stay,"Enjoyed a lovely overnight stay in this hotel- a gift from our family. Loved our room- very well appointed. Bed very very comfortable. Dinner was lovely with a scrumptious chocolate dessert. Enjoyed having a few drinks by the fire in the very large comfortable lobby. Breakfast was really top notch. Waiters and waitresses very friendly and helpful, Had a swim in the pool before we checked out.",4,2015,05,17
217,5-Star Amenities with Hick-Up Service. Free Parking and Admission to Gardens for Guests.,"LOCATION: 45 min from Dublin Airport by car; town of Bray is 15 min drive where you can catch DART (train) to Dublin (45 min to main station); Powerscourt Waterfall (15 min drive); Glendalough Village –Wicklow National Park (30 min drive); Town of Enniskerry is walking distance (restaurants, bars)

HOTEL: Luxurious former Ritz –Carlton, great amenities (spa, gym, lounge), own pub, beautiful rooms. The grounds and gardens are an absolute marvel. Unfortunately, the 5-star amenities do not match the service. This hotel has all the potential to be the best but they have to work on some things.

SERVICE/HICK-UPs: Check-in was fine, except that we were told that due to overbooking, out of the 6 nights reserved, we were politely asked to move to a “comparable” 5-star hotel for the last 2 nights. After looking at photos and reading reviews of the other hotel (Druids Glen), we kindly agreed and that was a mistake!  
Firstly, terms of transfer were not communicated well: The next day (AFTER we already agreed to transfer), I went to follow-up on the terms of our transfer and was told that we “agreed” to stay at Druids not for the last 2 nights but for the 2 nights in mid-week – so our last night was actually in limbo! If I had not gone to follow-up, boy, would we have been surprised. So they gave us a choice: to stay at Druids for the 3rdlast night or come back for one night to Powers. I mean seriously – that was ridiculous; we stayed at Druids.
Although, the “overbooking” situation was handled fairly well (they moved our luggage to another hotel, a complimentary bottle of wine was waiting for us at Druids, and free tickets to gardens were provided because we did not have time to visit them while staying at Powerscourt), for a 5-star hotel overbooking should not be a client’s problem – it is a 200 room hotel after all. In addition, when we came to check-out, there was a huge line of guests checking-in and although we asked to be taken care of (after all we did the hotel a big favor right?) we were just pointed to the general line and had to wait like everyone else. The lobby also had screaming and running kids all over the place; I do not know what can be done about that but this is a 5-star hotel, not a kindergarten and it was especially annoying when we had to spend 15 min waiting in line. Secondly, Druids was about 20 min farther from the Dublin Airport than Powers. Thirdly, Druids was definitely NOT comparable to Powerscourt by all parameters. The only 5-star amenity there is golf. If you love golf, Druids has one of the best golf courses, otherwise, it is just a hotel with good service and similar, but poorer quality amenities.

ROOM: we were on the first floor: gorgeous view, king-size bed, TV, chest to arrange your clothing, desk with chairs, lounge chair, magazines, full mini bar/fridge, tea/coffee plus a separate room with a safe, an iron and ironing board and closet.

BATHROOM: very nicely done; glass doors, marble floors; two sinks (mini shampoo, conditioner, soap, body lotion, shower cap, mouth wash, cotton balls, q-tips provided), a bath tub and a standing comfortable shower, 2 bath robes (slippers were in the ironing room for some reason)
 
BREAKFAST: NOT worth it (esp. at 28 euros pp!) here, again the service lacks. You can’t sit where you want, coffee is a wait and when it comes you pour it yourself; breakfast offers all regular items: eggs/sausages/hash browns/veggies/juice but everything is pretty much average and for this price you can definitely go elsewhere. There is complementary coffee/tea by the breakfast area.

Mc GILLS PUB: Great place to have a drink and a bite to eat in the evening. Food, drinks, and service are solid. We returned there a few times for some fish and chips (can share), good ribs (can share), scallops (small portion), delicious lamb Shepard pie (can share) and even desert. The service was good overall but manager went out of his way to get my husband the scotch that was not displayed at the bar and included a complementary hot chocolate brownie after our dinner.
 
SUGAR LOUNGE: Best view in the hotel! But closes at 10:30PM (Really?! No late night drinks?) The Lounge has a full bar and an area where you can enjoy drinks and food and an absolutely breathtaking views of pine tree forest, a fountain, and groomed greenery; we even saw a fox!

THE SPA: The spa is awesome. The pool is amazing! It is lit under water with Swarovski crystals in an otherwise very calm and dark area. The size is big and it also has a Jacuzzi. Steam room is good as well. Spa services available.

The GARDENS: (Note): The Gardens were designed by the same architect who designed the gardens in the Jamestown Castle in Wexford. These gardens are really breathtaking. Huge grounds with scenic views; a gorgeous pond and fountain surrounded by a wealth of greens. Japanese garden is a charm, rows of different tulips are mesmerizing, impressive variety of other flowers and trees. There are also a few gift shops and a restaurant on premises.",4,2015,05,16
217,Weekend retreat,"We stayed for 3 nights in this first class hotel in May. Everyone on the hotel staff and in the spa were superb hosts. Although we arrived late in the evening due to flight times, we were expected and greeted warmly. The room was excellent with all the facilities expected in a 5 star hotel. My spa day was wonderful including massage, facial and an excellent lunch. The hotel goes out of its way to make your stay memorable with a shuttle service to the village or a loan of bicycles. The hotel is set within a private estate in beautiful countryside with a historic house and beautiful garden to visit. Altogether an exceptionally pleasant stay and we will certainly return next time we are in Ireland.",5,2015,05,13
217,Superlative property,"The room, amenities, and location were wonderful.  This is an outstanding property.  We had an upper suite and well worth the extra cost.  Spacious, up to date electronics, great bathroom, super comfortable bed.  The outside terrace had marvellous views of the gardens and mountains in the distance.  Wifi is free with no need for all that login nonsense.  It wasn't fast however at only 2-3 Mb download speed, but enough to do most things.  Make sure you fit in a walk down to the river - it is quite a distance and get directions from the front desk, but it is a very beautiful setting.",5,2015,05,13
217,Staff not attentive,Myself and my boyfriend stayed here for 2 nights. In general the staff seemed friendly but not so attentive. On both mornings for breakfast we had to ask for toast and the attention from staff was minimal to say the least. On the second morning we had asked for a coffee refill and were so fed up of waiting for the attention of a member of staff to find out where our coffee was that we decided to leave. We also dined in Mc Gills pub and were left waiting 45 minutes for our meal. During which time not one member of staff approached us to apologise or ask if we'd like another drink. The hotel itself is beautiful and our room was amazing but the service was far from 5 star.,3,2015,05,10
217,Good solid weekend break hotel,"The hotel is well presented with courteous friendly staff , and very conveniently located close to the wonderful Powerscourt gardens and quaint Enniskerry village.
Rooms are generous with comfortable living area, walk in wardrobes and pleasant bathroom. Overall very nice accommodation.
Leisure facilities are good with a very nice pool and well equipped gym overlooking the gardens.
The food offer in the little onsite pub is good and breakfast buffet all you would expect from a good higher end hotel.",4,2015,05,09
217,Fantastic,"My husband booked a suite here as a mini break. The room was fantastic with a huge balcony with lovely views of the hotel and woodland. I've never slept in a bed so comfortable. We had dinner in both restaurants and was delicious. Breakfast was excellent with a huge variety and even had a table set up where you could pack a bag and take away with you for a picnic etc...at no extra cost.We thought this was a great touch which we have not seen at any other 5star hotel.We had spa treatments which were lovely and very relaxing. 

The only negatives which I encountered was when I asked reception about booking again as a gift for someone and what offers could they do etc I was referred to their website. I was looking to discuss and book there and then but they weren't interested. I still have not booked as I want to discuss but may also now look at other hotel options. Also, with the spa we had booked lunch before our treatments. When we were brought over to our table there were people already sitting at it who were not eating but were part of the group at the next table.The therapist mentioned to the guys at our table that we were waiting to sit there..and walked off leaving us to stand and wait for the people at our table to move-which was very awkward for us as they had ignored the therapist and continued their conversation at the next table.",5,2015,05,09
217,Can't Wait To Go Back,"This is a wonderul hotel located about an hour from Dublin city. We stayed here for a weekend and loved it! 

Positives:
The service is wonderful, we were staying to celebrate our anniversary and we are Marriott members we were kindly upgraded to suite.
The rooms, our suite was amazing. There was TV’s in the bathroom with the underfloor heating! We had a separate living/dining room which was lovely to relax in. The bedroom was very luxurious. 
The breakfast buffet was outstanding, with an abundance of fresh fruit, baked goods, eggs, breakfast meats, and cereals.
The hotels valet will bring you, if you can take yourself away from the hotel to the local village of Enniskerry which has a great selection of lovely restaurants and pubs
Spa is amazing, it is well worth a visit. We booked a ½ day package with included lunch and was amazing. I can highly recommend the facials.

Negatives:
We ate dinner in the Restaurant one evening, service was very slow and we were overcharged on our bill – so read the bill carefully!
One of the afternoons, we went over to Powerscourt Waterfalls and had to pay. Its just a little thing but surely as hotel residents, I would have expected that there would be no cost.

Overall, our stay was wonderful and I cannot wait to return again! This is by far, one of my favourite hotels in Ireland.",5,2015,05,07
217,Out of this world ,"Oh my goodness! My partner and I arrived and we were greeted with happy smiling receptionists! How lovely! We were given our key and went to our room! Our room was a suite, with a bed room, two bathrooms and a sitting room :) I could live in that room! Breakfast was fabulous, everything about our stay was top notch and I will hopefully be returning there again soon ",5,2015,05,07
217,Beautiful setting for a wedding,We stayed here recently for a wedding. Loved the area and the early check in. Always a bonus when your staying in a place like this. We went to the pub upstairs to eat and what we got was amazing and very good value. The plate was packed with food. It was a combo for two people and there was more than enough. The staff all over the hotel were fantastic and the rooms were out of this world. Beds were super comfortable and plenty of space. My friends wedding was a wonderful night and we really enjoyed our time here.,5,2015,05,06
217,Used to be a Ritz,"The hotel and our room were magnificent.  The heated floors in the bathroom and the elegant decorations are what you would expect from a Ritz Carlton.

However, don't expect Ritz level of service.

It isn't bad service but it isn't great.",4,2015,05,05
217,Highest rating for Ireland visit!,"We spent 6 nights at Powerscourt, starting and ending our visit to Ireland with 3 night stays at this spectacular resort.  It was included in a luxury package we purchased and we were a little apprehensive about staying outside of Dublin.   As it turned out, the resort was a highlight of our vacation.  We did spring for the upgrade to a suite which was about the size of a condo sans kitchen...well worth the extra cost.

Staff was always attentive and courteous, but also friendly.  I give Powerscourt 5 stars for service.  

The breakfast buffet was outstanding, with an abundance of fresh fruit, baked goods, eggs, breakfast meats, and cereals.  In addition, cooked-to-order eggs dishes could be ordered for no additional cost.  I seldom have high expectation of room service food, but have to rave about the delicious (and hot) food delivered to our room on our first day when we were too tired to venture out.  We ate dinner once in the signature Sika restaurant and felt it was ok for their fine dining experience.

Powerscourt is located in Enniskerry, which has a tiny town about 3 km away.  It's handy as there are four pubs and casual restaurants which offer variety for dining.  The hotel's valet happily delivers and picks you up at the town's restaurants so you don't have to worry about maneuvering the narrow road back after a few drafts.",5,2015,05,04
217,Beautiful hotel but service more 3 Star than 5 Star,"I visited Powerscourt with my wife and another couple at the end of April.

A summary of our actual experience follows but before that let me say the response I received when sending a more detailed version of this review to the hotel was excellent. They did not try to come up with excuses, appreciated the feedback and unreservedly apologised.

Positives

Beautiful hotel in beautiful surroundings, a lovely little village nearby and some nice mini excursions nearby, all within the Powerscourt Estate.

The room we had in terms of size and layout was excellent.

My wife and her friend had excellent massages and treatments at ESPA.

The staff were all very pleasant and helpful.

Negatives

We feel we were spun a line about the room situation. Even after several emails and phone calls on the subject, when we arrived we had still only been allocated Classic Suites, no mountain view, no balcony, in fact only a view of the building itself. We were told on arrival that all of the mountain room views had been ""allocated to a large group"" that was at the hotel. So having been told in advance on different occasions that ""I can assure you you will be happy with your room"", ""we only allocate rooms a week or two before the stay"", ""we allocate rooms on a first come first served basis on the day"" we were very disappointed to hear that in fact the best rooms had all along been allocated to a company with what proved to be 400 guests. Why not tell us the truth? We may well have gone elsewhere had we known.

The 400 guest booking may have been good for the hotel and the group but clearly not for any other guest.

•	Having pre-booked dinner at the hotel when we made the booking months back we were told, albeit a few days in advance of arrival, that the restaurant was closed for a private function i.e. the 400 group. 
•	We wanted to have lunch in McGill's bar and restaurant on the day we arrived. It was ""closed for a private function"" which left just the upstairs area to eat, which we did.
•	In general the 400 group not surprisingly had the hotel's full attention and other guests, whilst not totally ignored, were made to feel like second class citizens.

Not the behaviour of a 5 star (or ""luxury resort"") hotel.

We were not shown to the room. Our room wasn't ready when we arrived at 1pm, although our friends' was. In itself not a big issue although we weren't given any information about the hotel, our room or the services on arrival. The biggest issue arose when we couldn't work out how to turn off the AC and the bedroom lights late at night. We eventually, the next day, worked out by asking one of the housekeeping staff, that there was a 3rd remote in the bedside table for turning off electrics in the bedroom. My wife, after searching all possibilities, had to unscrew light bulbs and unplug lamps to get dark in the room.

We did not get a ""turn down service"" the first night, so no water in the room etc. This also exacerbated the fact that all the lights and AC were on in the bedroom all night and the room was cold. We didn't call downstairs at the time (should have) as it was already very late and had thought we had already looked everywhere and tried everything.

We were told in the upstairs bar, on arriving back at 10:30pm, that that bar had just closed and we needed to go to McGill's (the place we couldn't go to for lunch) even though including us there were at least a dozen people still in the bar, and did I say it was only 10:30pm? Thankfully one of the staff, Conor (who was, in general, someone the hotel should be very proud of), after our remonstrating, offered to go down to McGill's to get us drinks.

We were then told that McGill's would likely be closed the next night and only the upstairs bar would be open, as they keep only one of them open after 10:30pm.

Many of these issues come down to the hotel being, in my view, short staffed. Apart from the above examples, on two different occasions, early evening and late am, there was only one staff member on reception and no-one on concierge.

Concierge, when staffed, was not very well trained or informed. They sent us in the wrong direction twice and recommendations on places to eat outside the hotel were lacking.

A small gripe but, given the cost of the rooms, the so-called 5 star rating of the hotel, and the fact that the Gardens and Waterfall are all part of Powerscourt, I would have expected that there would be no cost to hotel residents for visiting those areas.

Beautiful hotel, awesome surroundings, great staff but definitely not a 5 star experience.  Shame. But still had a lovely time. Maybe we were just unlucky.",3,2015,05,04
217,"5* Facilities, 4* Service","The hotel facilities are fantastic, very luxurious. The bedrooms in particular are very spacious with lounge area and a dressing room. The gardens and surrounding area are beautiful and ideal for walks in particular the nearby gardens. It is disappointing that the service levels fell well below the standard you would expect from such a hotel. We had made dinner reservations for our first evening but were advised the week before that the restaurant would be shut and that we could eat in the in house pub McGills. We arrived at lunch time and decided to try McGills before committing to having dinner there. We were informed it was reserved for a private function and told we could eat at the sugar loaf lounge in the reception area. The lunch here was very good but we decided to eat in the village that evening. When we returned at 10.30pm we went for a night cap in the bar but were informed that it closed at 10.30. REALLY. The waiter Conor recovered the position by going to fetch our drinks from the McGill bar downstairs. I can't praise Conor highly enough as he also informed us of local things to see or go to. The following evening there was no such trouble as the bar was serving drinks to 12pm. There was a large conference staying at the hotel (400+) which probably caused all the problems booking the restaurant/bar etc. If the hotel can raise the standard of the service to match the facilities this would be an outstanding hotel.",4,2015,05,04
217,Stunning View of the Sugarloaf from our room,"I was here for five nights on a business trip with my husband.  I had heard great things about Powerscourt and was not disappointed in the least!  Room was super spacious.  The bathroom was huge - separate shower, deep tub and separate toilet.  Beds were comfy.

It is about 40 minutes from Dublin airport....about 100 Euros.  You can take the dart to Bray and then a taxi (about 15 Euros) to the hotel.  Enniskerry is a super cute town.  The area around the Powerscourt hotel is gorgeous and the gardens (and some shops, including Avoca) are just a ten minute walk from the hotel.",5,2015,05,04
217,Simply the best,"The customer service here is top-shelf, and the location and amenities are equal to the service. These folks are to be complimented. Their attention to detail and thoughtful approach, from menus to amenities, is very much worth the price. Highly recommend.",5,2015,05,03
217,Very Disappointing,"I felt very lucky to be able to stay a night in this prestigious hotel recently unfortunately it was a very underwhelming experience. I will start with the positives, the room was simply beautiful and everything you would expect from a five star, they also kindly upgraded us to a superior double room at check in which was a nice touch. The breakfast was delicious with a wide range of fresh and tasty food to chose from for any palate. The surroundings of the hotel and the lobby entrance are breath taking and allows for a very relaxed and tranquil experience. Sadly this tranquility was quickly lost in the hectic spa area and the poor service and food we received while dining in the Sika restaurant. The pool area in the spa was full of children and although they are only allowed in from 3-6pm this time coincided with the only time we would be attending the spa on our one night stay. There were used towels and plastic cups thrown everywhere.  The pool was so full it was impossible to do any swimming or relax around the pool area due to the noise levels. There is also a hot pool and steam room but both were so full there was actually no room to get in. Thankfully as we had booked treatments we were allowed into a second spa area upstairs, however we were not informed about this area when we arrived to the spa even though we advised we had massages booked. It was not until we went up to see if there was a sauna anywhere were we advised of this separate area. This second area has a tranquility room with beds to lie in overlooking the Wicklow mountains, unfortunately all the beds were full. There were also separate men and women saunas and steam rooms which were a lot quieter then the main spa area. The next day when we went to the spa in the morning we asked to use the sauna again but were told that as we did not have treatments booked that day we would have to pay 5 euro extra to use the other facilities. The massages themselves were ok, I have had a lot better and the room was quite cold. Overall the whole spa experience was not what you would expect from a top class hotel. The second main problem came at dinner time. We dined in the Sika restaurant, our starters were tasty and well cooked. We then had to wait an hour and a half for the main course. When we eventually received them I found my pan fried halibut was completely overcooked, dried out and chewy. I advised our friendly waiter of this. He advised it was not up to standard and would cook us a new one but I would have to wait another 25 minutes. I agreed as the fish was inedible but sadly the second attempt was not much better. It took three hours for us to be served are entire meal which is simply not acceptable. We complained on check out and the wine we had  and 100euro was kindly removed from our bill. However anyone would expect a far superior experience considering the high prices you pay to stay in this supposedly luxurious hotel.",2,2015,05,03
217,CFN President's,"Excellent hotel, service, staff. Golfing is very good and the spa is great. Ask for Don if you enjoy deep tissue massages. He's one of the best I've ever encountered. Rooms are beautiful and gym is big with good equipment for a hotel.  Good is very good and concierge is great. Even if we weren't here on biz, would definitely recommend. And you're in Ireland! What else can you ask for?",5,2015,05,02
217,Pure luxury,"My partner and I stayed here for one night for my birthday and had a fantastic time! The rooms are fantastic; we had a beautiful room on the 6th floor with views of the Sugar Loaf mountain. The bed is huge and very comfortable. I loved the tv in the bathroom mirror! 

The spa there is well worth a visit. My partner and I opted for he couples suite which I would highly recommend. 

We dind that evening in the Sika restaurant. There was a good selection of food on the menu and quite an extensive wine list. The food was delicious. Breakfast is a self service set up. I would recommend going down for breakfast around 10am as it gets quite busy after that and you could be waiting for a table. There is a good variety of fruit, bread, cereals and hot opions available. I loved the self service pancake maker.

All the staff in the hotel are very pleasent and helpful. I could not say a bad word about any staff member we encounered during our visit there. 

One thing I really like about the hotel was the extra little touches (e.g. fruit basket in room, mini mouthwash in the bathroom, given bottles of water on departure for the journey home).

I would highly recommend staying there. It is the best hotel I've stayed in and I cannot wait to return!",5,2015,04,29
217,the best!!!,"We loved the hotel and the staff.  The hotel and grounds are beautiful but the staff are hands down the best we have experienced.  From the concierge staff to all the wait staff and bellmen, they went above and beyond to make our experience memorable and enjoyable.  We would definitely go back and highly recommend .",5,2015,04,28
217,Fantastic friendly staff in a beautiful hotel with top class facilities.,"My wife and I went for a two night stay and were overwhelmed with this fabulous
property in the most amazing setting. Our room was spacious and very comfortable.
The Bedrooms are the best I have seen for a longtime with great views of the beautiful
countryside. We had dinner in the main restaurant and we really enjoyed same. It is 
fine dining without been over the top and we found the service not in your face but 
relaxed, it was like great service should be, your getting the service but you don't notice it. We had dinner in the bar downstairs the next night very casual and the service again was exceptional. Food was top class again, I really enjoyed the Burger and would recommend same.
We used the Spa and if your planning a visit bring your gear. The pool is lovely
very peaceful and the whole ambience is totally about relaxation. I have to say the spa 
area was spotless. This hotel ticks all the boxes, if your on business or just a simple getaway with or without kids this is the place for you.",5,2015,04,28
217,"Stunning view, great location, fab hotel","This was my third visit to Powerscourt Hotel although I had been previously at the Ritz Carlton which was its previous name. As the Ritz Carlton it was somewhat offputting. As the Powerscourt Hotel, it is still five star but friendly and laid back. Everyone feels at home here and it has lost that stand offishness that was redolent of its previous existence.
I stayed on last Friday 24th April and once again the hotel lived up to its reputation for  its ambience and its fantastic location. It is a world apart from Dublin yet just 30 minutes by car. The rooms are stunning and it is impossible not to have a great view of the rolling Wicklow hills. I played golf on one of the adjoining courses at Powerscourt Golf Club; returned and relaxed in their spa and followed with a few relaxing drinks in their ""secret garden."" I opted for dinner in their restaurant which was excellent. And to round off a great night me and my partner enjoyed a few drinks in McGills Bar which was great fun. It was almost like being in a country pub as the atmosphere was friendly and the crowd were in engaging form.
If you have the opportunity stay at Powerscourt.",5,2015,04,28
217,Best of the Best!!,"This hotel is on the Ritz-Carlton/Four Season level.  Nestled in a beautiful natural setting, amazing property and amenities.  Friendly staff, BEST beds, sound proof room with private balcony, marble bathroom, immaculately clean.  This hotel was the grand finale of our two week, action packed European vacation and provided the perfect relaxing retreat before heading home.  You can't go wrong with the Powerscourt Hotel.  We hope to return.",5,2015,04,27
217,Okay but not great!,"My girlfriend and I came to stay here for our anniversary, I had previously sent an email enquiring how I could make the weekend extra special with something local to do in the area but received not reply at all, not very good customer service. At breakfast in the morning a lot of guests were offered toast but we were not! Felt badly treated as a younger couple and not taken seriously! ",3,2015,04,26
217,Overpriced & Understaffed,"Myself and my wife stayed here last night. It had been on her 'bucket list' for a while and it was my treat to her as a late birthday present. A five minute wait at reception greeted us as there was only one receptionist available at our time of checkin. Our room at €250 b&b for the night was beautiful and spacious but it was literaly overlooking the front doors of the hotel (533). We went to the inhouse bar - McGills for some food (a bowl of chowder and a toasted sandwich) at about 3.30 but had to wait 40minute to get it. What made it all the worse was seeing people receiving their food before us that had come into the bar after us. A group beside us ordered 3 ceaser salads (2 initially and another 20mins later for a late arrivial) only for all three to come out with no dressing on them. Later that evening we came back to the bar for food again (as the restaurant was fully booked from our checkin time earlier in the day). The food which we got was lovely but the menu is limited and pricey. Not vegetarian friendly either at all. €9 for desserts with only three to pick from and all of which were chocolate based and heavy. We ordered a round of drinks from one girl who seemed to forget all about us as we had to order again 15mins later. A table beside us were waiting 35 mins on their mains and when it did arrive one dish was sent back for being cold.

At breakfast this morning we queued to get in at 10am (service stops at 11). We were then put on a waiting list and asked to wait out on the balcony. Thankfully it was sunny!!! 20mins later we were seated. They were clearly understaffed as there were lots a empty tables but they just hadnt been reset. Breakfast itself was fantastic with an amazing selection to choose from.

To us it is a hotel living on its reputation for amazing views and a celiberity wedding. It is in no way 5star and is completely over priced (even down to the €5 for a 200ml bottle of coke in our mini bar). It is clearly understaffed which lets it down hughly also. A bucket list item ticked off but not to be put on our list of places to return back to. A shame really.

217,Beautiful facilities. Friendly staff.,"The rooms were outstanding. Large and free hi speed wifi. 

Fabulous lower level pool with twilight lighting it felt like  a grotto. The website photos made me think you had to book a massage, but they are open to swim through out the day. Nice hot tub adjacent.  And it is big enough to get a  reasonable lap in. But swim first and warm latter. (The reverse makes the plunge so much harder.)  While they have a beautiful o locker room And you are encouraged to wear a robe and go straight from your room to the pool using the elevator.
 
Robbie their morning concierge told me about a bridge out on a road I just googled for access to the military highway. . He saved me backtracking 60 miles of one lane road. 

As for the grounds the landscaping beautiful. But went too early April , for full blooms. The pet cemetery (in a corner of the grounds) was  poignant having just lost my best friend.

I highly recommend. 30 Minutes from Dublin and your in complete countryside.",5,2015,04,26
217,Wondeful hotel,"This isnt my first time staying here and it wont be my last.  Beautiful hotel, excellent service.  Room was beyond expectations. I couldnt fault the hotel in any way. However, the restaurant,  Sika, was without a doubt the biggest disappointment ever.  There was little to no atmosphere,  the food was mushy and bland. It wad a horrible meal that I wouldn't eat agin if you paid me, which makes it even more painful as it was very expensive.  The hotel I would highly recommend to anyone,  but avoid the restaurant as it is way below standard.  I noticed other diners complaining too. Stay here and you will be very pleased. But dine elsewhere. ",4,2015,04,24
217,Better now,"This was a much more enjoyable stay than when it was the Ritz Carlton. The service is excellent and less stuffy than it used to be. All food was perfect and that breakfast really is worth the stay alone. My favourite part of the hotel!
The pool area hasn't changed so i still don't like it. The darkness and black just makes it feel cold.
Our room was good and really big. There were 2 lights that we just could not find a switch for to turn off no matter where we looked but it wasn't the end of the world.",4,2015,04,24
217,5Temp,"My husband and I just returned last night from a wonderful trip to Ireland. Our headquarters was at The Powerscourt Hotel. Can't say enough about the place. Probably one of the nicest, most comfortable hotels I stayed and the staff made it possible. Shout out to Liz, Robbie, Stefan and Adrian at the Conceige desk for making the most of our days and Sarah, Imear (sorry for spelling) at front desk. Magdalena & Jessica and their smiling faces at the delicious breakfast each morning. And Owen, who is just the nicest guy, who drove us into town and helped me with the safe! We cannot wait to return! Thank you to everyone!",5,2015,04,22
217,A sub standard five star ,"We came to this hotel with high expectations of staying in one of the countries finest five star properties for a short break. Overall we felt let down as the hotel feels like it has been under an accountants surgical knife.

Starting with the positives the hotel is set in beautiful surrounding countryside and is very imposing. The room we stayed in was a mountain view suite and was probably bigger than most city dwellers apartments with all the amenities you would expect. The hotel has a good fitness suite and Spa facilities too. The view of sugar loaf mountain from our room was beautiful. 

What lets it down is some of the things you would expect from a five star hotel were not what you would have expected, for the very high price you pay to stay in this type of property

The hotel has a good bar called McGills but this did not open until six o'clock pm which was a surprise. The second day we went there for a drink we were turned away because it was rented out for a Corporate event and would not take money from residents. This was an issue as McGills also serve pub food too so you could not eat there forcing residents to eat in their other restaurant, Sika, which although good was also very expensive with the two of us paying €180 for a two course meal with two glasses of wine each. We ended up taking a taxi out of the hotel to eat in Johnny Fox's excellent pub a short drive away. 

The bedroom has a double balcony which would have been nice to sit out on in the sun if the door lock worked. We asked housekeeping to fix that which they did on the second day. It worked once, then stopped working again.  The room also uses a control panel which operate lights and the two sets of curtains in the room. The set in the bedroom did not work even though you could hear a motor trying to move the curtains. I phoned housekeeping about getting it fixed and was told the curtains were ""manual"" which was just nonsense. We were also did not receive a complimentary newspaper each morning which we were entitled too. 

Breakfast on the first morning was a surprise. We were seated but not asked if we wanted tea or coffee which is not something you would expect. Toast is not automatically offered. You have to ask for it. Normally there would be an omelette station in five star properties like this. Instead you have to specifically ask for it from the kitchen without seeing what ingredients they have available. All examples of cost cutting which you don't expect when paying five star prices. 

The gardens had a giant wooden  chess set which you could not use as the pieces were made of wood and were very heavy and a number of the pieces were broken and unusable. 

Generally we found  most of the staff were professional but lacked a sense of warm to their personality that you would find in other hotels of similar stature.

All in all, it was a pleasant break but the constant list of things not being right spoiled the experience somewhat for us. 
",2,2015,04,22
217,A magical place to stay!,"I love this resort! The rooms are very large, the restaurants are excellent, and the staff is wonderful. The hotel is located on the grounds of the Powerscourt Estate so you are literally walking distance from the 3rd highest rated garden in the world. The views are tremendous as you will notice immediately as you check in, with the Sugar Loaf mountain clearly visible from the lobby. The staff all go out of their way to help you. The onsite pub is a great place to hang out after dinner or you can walk down the hill to the quaint village of Enniskerry. I plan on returning very soon and would consider moving there if I could talk my wife into it.",5,2015,04,21
217,OVERPRICED IRELAND AT ITS WORST!!,"I had a truly awful experience.  Obviously, they have no idea how to treat guests (some of whom are paying thousands to stay there). In my opinion, this is one to avoid - avoid it if you don't like throngs of kids jumping all over the swimming pool; avoid it if you don't want to be patronized by the smirking, dishonest staff who give you half- answers in an annoying sign-song accent that's supposed to be authentic; avoid it if you want a meal that isn't some 2nd rate cookery school drop-out's idea of ""gourmet"" (for which you will be an charged extortionate price); I found the bar also to be an overstaffed, phoney production of ""Irish Twee"" posers who obviously hate guests, and hotel work .  I hated this place AND WILL NEVER GO BACK.",1,2015,04,21
217,Great location - great staff.,"Loved this beautiful resort.  Great location for exploring Wicklow and Dublin.  So much to do, and then you have the pleasure of reaaaallly relaxing in a gorgeous setting.  We thought the staff were especially lovely. Shout out to our boys Keith, Padraig, Shane, and Ian, who were bar tenders for our group.  They certainly made sure we had a great time!",5,2015,04,20
217,Great Family Easter Break,We stayed here over Easter Holidays with our 2 children. It was perfect. Plenty of families around. Rooms - very spacious / clean / comfortable. Rooms (we took a suite) were great - we were able to settle the 2 and then slide across the doors and have a glass of wine in the living room area. Breakfast was a fantastic spread and staff - although under pressure over Easter were excellent. Pool - lovely - clean. Grounds are gorgeous - our kids are too young for cycling but there are bikes and great maps to guide you around. The concierge dropped us into Enniskerry one night for a pizza with the kids and then collected us - which was a great service. If I am pushed for a downside - the hotel was perfect for us as a family - I can see how it does very well for weddings / girls weekends away etc but I would probably not stay here just with my partner. There is that slight Celtic Tiger (v big) / slightly soulless feel to it but that is just a personal preference. I will return with the family.,4,2015,04,20
217,Favorite Countryside Hotel!,"The Powerscourt Hotel provided the perfect setting for a relaxing, luxurious getaway. It's a true 5 star hotel, through and through. My husband and I, although we live in Dublin, wanted a relaxing weekend and that is exactly what we got with our mini ""staycation"" at the Powerscourt hotel! And the biggest bonus of all is that our ""fur-baby"" got to come with us, because the hotel is dog friendly!! We absolutely hate leaving her behind when we travel, and it was so amazing that our little family of 3 was able to have a wonderful weekend together. The surrounding area is lovely, we had a perfect day of hiking and seeing the massive waterfall that is a short drive away from the hotel. We loved the running/walking trails in the area for hotel guests only - it was very quiet and peaceful, our dog loved it too! We had never seen her so tired before after our fun day in the Wicklow countryside. I booked a Large room and it was lovely. I wish we had a mountain view, but I booked the hotel very last minute and on the website there were no mountain view rooms or suites left. We had a large balcony, which was great! There was a separate seating area and sofa which was wonderful to relax and unwind after a beautiful day. The bed was SO comfortable, our dog reported her bed was comfy as well :-) So nice that they put a leather dog bed and dog dish in the room for their four-legged guests. The bathroom was luxurious as well, loved the rain shower head and large bathtub. Breakfast was very good - buffet style with tons of options, every single thing my husband and I had was delicious. I signed up for Marriott's rewards before our stay and the breakfast and wifi were complimentary with our room. Everyone at the hotel was incredibly friendly and accommodating. We were delighted to find out that the pool/fitness center area was complementary - we wouldn't have known this if the receptionist at checkin didn't tell us. The pool area was beautiful - VERY peaceful and relaxing, and the hot tub was incredible as well. We did not dine at the hotel, but rather went into the little Enniskerry village. The hotel has a complimentary car that dropped us off in the town and picked us up when we were ready to come back to the hotel! Was very nice to have that option as we didn't really want to be walking on the dark country roads. We had a nightcap at McGills Pub and it was a fantastic resident's bar - it had the look and feel of being in an Irish pub, you almost forget you are in a hotel. I don't golf so we didn't visit the golf course, but my husband has golfed here a number of times with his friends and says it's a gorgeous course. The two nights we stayed was not enough, and we are really looking forward to our next visit. Do yourself a favor if you want to stay near Dublin but in the countryside, chose the Powerscourt Hotel. The rooms are comfortable and elegant and the hotel and its amenities are quite luxurious.",5,2015,04,19
217,Highly Recommend,"Myself and my husband checked in on a Friday afternoon,where we were warmly welcomed and brought to our room. We stayed in a fabulous suite, very spacious and comfortable. I had a treatment in the spa which i had previously booked. My therapist was a lovely girl Lauren who was friendly and very attentive towards me. 

We spent the rest of the afternoon at the spa where unfortunately the sauna was under maintenance so we couldnt use, but didnt mind as the pool area was very relaxing. 

My husband had booked both restaurants for dinner as we were unsure of the kind of meal we would want. We ended up choosing the Sugar Lounge were we sat at a window seat looking out onto the gardens and mountains. The view was spectacular. 

Our server Conor was very helpful as some of the food and wine we were unsure off. He recommended the beef croquettes for starter and they were beautiful. He was a professional, friendly waitor who even gave us a bit of background into the powerscourt area. He also recommended we go for a walk around the grounds in the morning and that there was live music in Millers Pub which we went to after our meal. Overall we were very impressed with the service. 

I would highly recommend this hotel it is just outside the City and a great place to escape and relax.",5,2015,04,16
217,Amazing property in beatiful setting,"My girlfriend and I stayed at the Powerscourt for one of the college football games held in Dublin. It was the 3rd leg of our European trip and we made reservations fairly late so we took a chance on staying at Powerscourt without knowing much about it. Turned out to be the best decision we made on our trip. 

The hotel itself is absolutely perfect, it appears to be older but is actually a recent build. Because one of the team swas staying at the hotel and taking up all the normal rooms we were upgraded to an 1,800 Sq Ft suite. After hearing the horror stories of tiny European hotel rooms, that room was completely unexpected. The room itself was a luxurious as could be, 2 full bathrooms, a perfect bed and a balcony that overlooked the mountain. 

The staff was incredibly friendly and helped us plan out a day in the countryside that we hadn't pre-planned at all. Although we enjoyed our time in the city for the game, being out in country around the grounds was perfect.

The restaurants on site were also very good, especially the free breakfast that we received due to our Marriott status. 

Overall a wonderful experience. We can't wait to return to Ireland and the Powerscourt again.",5,2015,04,16
217,Birthday bliss.,"We checked in for two nights to celebrate my birthday. The spa is amazing, the staff were very accomidating, the food was outstanding and the rooms were more than adequate.  Five star all the way.  There is so much to do in the area but the hotel is so luxurious you don't realy want to leave.  We will be back next year for sure",5,2015,04,15
217,"Top class in stunning location. Pure luxury, comfort & elegance!","A truly beautiful location. Stunning huge rooms, great staff & a superb restaurant. A couple of nice bars onsite with excellent bar snacks to set you up for the day. Breakfast in bed is always so well worthwhile too. You must book a spa treatment as this really is an amazing experience. Go on - treat yourself - you deserve this. (And no, I do not work here!)",5,2015,04,14
217,Switswoo ,"A great spot, lovely food, best breakfast I have had anywhere, the best!! Rooms are great, so is the pool area. The pub down stairs is cold but nice. Couldn't get access to cocktail bar, I was told it was reserved but no one came. I would go back but look out for deals, it's not cheap.",4,2015,04,13
217,"Amazing, luxurious and beautiful","This was the most beautiful hotel that I have ever stayed in. So luxurious, the staff were so friendly and extremely helpful. The beds are the comfiest beds ever. The food in the hotel was amazing and the bar was just fantastic. I would stay here forever if I could. The grounds are stunning also and there is a lot around the area to do and explore.",5,2015,04,13
217,Not all I'd expected,"As a group we spent a lovely night at Powerscourt Hotel, now before the fact there was an issue with double-bookings and we were on standby to not even get our party in the hotel, regardless of being booked in months in advance. With this sorted out, we had arrived for what was sure to be a great night.

We were greeted by lovely reception staff and much to our delight, everyone was upgraded, however, one of the rooms was not ready until 2 hours after our check in time, very disappointing and there was also a mix up where the wrong couple got a large suite despite clear instruction on who the birthday girl was. A bad start! 

We proceeded to have some lunch and drinks... on 2 occasions there was a mix up with what we'd ordered, which is fine, but how hard is it to write down the order considering a mistake was already made; as well as us finding it very difficult to charge things to a single room opposed to the master account. Staff seemed ratty when we inconvenienced them with charging things to the right couple opposed to one room, we were only a group of 20 I guess...

Now we had been promised to be greeted in person by the manager upon arrival and in the evening, he never showed. This was very disappointing. We were then told he'd meet us before we had dinner, again, no show. 

On to dinner. Dinner was for the most part exceptional, Peter and George took excellent care of us, the food was wonderful and we enjoyed a private meal downstairs, champagne on the house. This was much appreciated. 

As the bar had been booked out for an event/function, we had to take our drinks in the lobby being told by staff to quite down twice...not pleased with this, had we an alternative place to take our festivities, we would have, but to book out the whole bar to a group wasn't really ideal. Now, Angus at the bar was a gent, good to chat, quick service, the supervisor could craic a smile, he did seem to extend the bar and that was nice, but a resident bar closing at 2:00am in a hotel of this class was very surprising, perhaps the guys who booked out the actual bar, got a late one. 

The room was exceptional to be fair, the bed, the bathroom, TV in the mirror, outstanding and the leisure center was maybe the nicest I've ever seen, heated floors, nice loungers and wonderful hot tub. One couple in our party got a 30 minute extension to check out and then an hour at a push but not 2 hours after being inconvenienced upon check in. 

Finally, there seemed to be puddles in the corners of the car park over night, not easy to get the the car without wet feet. 

In summary, I was very pleased with the trip but I think some of the staff could do with some customer service training and perhaps learn to smile. Facilities, food and board were very impressive.",4,2015,04,13
217,"Luxurious hotel, fabulous location","I am a little late leaving this review as I visited sept 2014 but thought I would add it whilst leaving a review elsewhere.
My husband booked this as a surprise, I thought we were staying in central Dublin. We pulled up in the car park ostensibly for afternoon tea and I wasn't overly impressed as the entrance is quite understated. Inside is different, definitely a 5 star stunning reception area. This fabulous building is best viewed from the rear grounds where it is revealed in its full glory. 
Originally a ritz carlton, it shows. We had a suite as large as an apartment, beautifully furnished and equipped. Even a tv in the mirror in the massive marble bathroom! 
We stayed for 3 nights and it was not enough.  We found staff attentive without being overbearing. The breakfast staff were especially kind. We had room service once and we really enjoyed it the whole theatre of it! With a beautifully dressed table wheeled in and our food set out. I can't remember what we had but we both remember it as being good. The hotel gardens are lovely and there is also a riverside walk and of course Powerscourt Gardens (entrance fee) which have to be ranked amongst the top gardens in the world. (I think they are actually)
Wicklow is such a beautiful county and staying at such a wonderful hotel made it extra special. 
Well worth the extra expense. We would definitely return.",5,2015,04,11
217,So worth 5 stars,"Just back from a one night stay in this hotel and it was amazing. We had a mountain view suite and the room was fantastic. Kitchen, sitting room, dining room, bedroom, 2 bathrooms and a huge balcony. The room was spotless and could not have been nicer in any way. We also ate in the restaurant we got the 3 course set menu and the food was amazing everything from the starter to desert nothing could be faulted. The staff are very professional and I really cant see why people are leaving negative reviews. I will defiantly return to this hotel. By the way make sure to go down to the restaurant for breakfast as the choice is 10 times better than if you et it brought to the room!! Pictures do not do this hotel justice.",5,2015,04,09
217,Stunning hotel and exceptional service,"A freind and  stayed in this fantastice hotel for a mid week girlie break. From the minute we entered the hotel the service was exceptional. Check in was efficient and friendly and as we were a bit early to get our room we took the opportunity to visit the sugarloaf lounge which has beautiful views, very attentive staff and divine cocktails! The rooms are beautiful and the beds are the most comfortable beds I have slept in. We dined in McGills bar and had a lovely meal followed by some excellent music. One of the highlights also has to be the breakfast - I would genuinely recommend a stay here for a touch of luxury",5,2015,04,09
217,Beautiful venue,"This was the second time staying here and it won't be the last. The hotel is beautiful and the location is stunning. 

The first time we stayed here we were treated pretty badly by a member of the front of desk staff. We addressed this with the manager who dealt with it well and accepted that the staff member had been wrong. We were a bit wary coming back but I'm glad we did!

We used the spa and got treatments so we had access to the serenity room. I would definitely recommend this, it's amazing. 

Our room had a view of the car park (specifically the smoking area) which they deceptively call a garden view. This really isn't a big issue as the suite we were in was absolutely amazing. Unfortunately our room was across from the kitchen so when we opened the door, a strong smell of fish came into the room and stayed a while. Not really a big issue as the smell went away, but this might be a bigger issue for some people. Also I wouldn't mark the rating down because of this though, particularly as we didn't bring it up with the front of house staff.

All in all it was a fantastic visit and I would recommend it to anyone. But, I would make sure you know EXACTLY what you have booked before hand as they have a tendency to change things on you without notification. Don't delete your confirmation email until you have seen the room you're getting!",4,2015,04,09
217,"5 star location, not 5 star service","I stayed recently with my wife and kids. Location is fantastic but not the 5 star menus and service you'd expect. I'd love the opportunity to discuss their menus with management as there is a demand for what Powerscourt are not offering on their menus. If management spent any time to check where their courtesy cars are bringing their clients to local restaurants every evening, offering the choice of food this resort has decided is not relevant, I am sure there would be more people travelling to eat at this salubrious venue.
On the morning of our departure, I complained about the room being too warm and that the AC controls not working to the receptionist on duty, who was in no way apologetic. In answer to the room climate control not working, she said that she would let the service engineers know and quickly changed the subject. She had dealt with not so happy customers before.

Five star quality in any hotel means five star service, and judging from our experience that weekend, I would give it 3 stars, maybe 4 at best. I won't be rushing to book this expensive place again!",3,2015,04,08
217,So nearly 5 stars.....,"My husband and two children are just home from a two night stay in one of the suites. The room is to die for:- 2 bathrooms, tv built into mirror, huge comfy bed, beautiful views, pull out bed & cot ready on arrival, spotlessly clean. We could not fault the bedroom at all. Check in was friendly yet professional. But I'm sad to say there are a few negatives with our stay. 

1. McGills Bar. 
On our first night we ate in McGills. I understand that it was over the Easter holidays but there is no excuse for waiting over 45 minutes for the starters to arrive and a further 50 minutes for the main courses. When the food did arrive it was good, but no apologies for the delay! 

2. Check out. 
This has to have been one of the worst we've had. I don't expect a full blown conversation but a smile and to be asked if we enjoyed our stay would have been nice. I believe these are the basics in customer service. Ruth, I believe her name is, needs a bit of training I doubt. When the bill was printed off it was abruptly set down in front of us, weren't asked to check it and we had to ask for the money to be refunded onto our card. There were no goodbyes, thanks for staying or enjoy the day!!  I know this is not the standard for this hotel as check in was perfect and we've stayed before and did not experience anything like this. 

I do not want to end this review on a negative note as it is a lovely hotel to stay in and we had a wonderful few days away, so I will tell you about the very friendly and attentive waiter at breakfast. Solemn, you are a credit to the hotel. You looked genuinely happy to be at work and were very helpful, especially offering to make my little boy a hot chocolate when the restaurant was extremely busy. It was much appreciated. 

We will be back Powerscourt and thank you for our stay!! 
",4,2015,04,08
217,Enjoyable stay - not quite five star though,"Palladian-style building with beige and robin's-egg blue rooms containing modern versions of 18th-century furnishings and marble bathrooms - not too my taste personally but our room felt luxurious nontheless.  We booked a mountain view suite - very spacious with nice views!

I would say the service was not 5 star.  It wasn't very attentive.  ie. we checked in early and were told our room would be ready in an hour and someone would call me.  Two hours later, and with no phone call I went back to reception to query delay.  We were given a key to our room.

Lunch at the Sugar Loaf - when we had finished eating, all of our dirty dishes were left on the table for a long time before being cleared after we had to ask.

These issues are no big deal generally but when you re paying a lot of money for five star service, you should receive the service.",4,2015,04,07
217,Huge disappointment!,"We are staying here 2 nights and this is our first night. 

We have stayed here twice before when hotel was operated by Ritz Carlton and we wrote positive reviews.

Only thing positive this time (since hotel got a new name) is that staff is nice.

Restaurant was a huge disappointment. Ambiance, decor and food were all way below 5 star hotel standards. Cheapest bottle of full bodied red wine starts at 60 EUR, yet food is no better than pub grub. Our starter was bland, stake under cooked and desert disappointing.

We stayed in suite which was great. However there was no turn down service. When I rang reception then we were told that this has to be requested. This is not acceptable for 5 star hotel and suite level price range!

I'm sorry to say but unless tomorrow wont be a better experience then we will never be back.",2,2015,04,06
217,Easter break,"Absolute fantastic hotel and grounds.pictures do not do this place justice.you simply have to come and see for yourself.
The staff and food are excellent plus I really liked the way they cater for families by going the extra mile to keep all happy.",5,2015,04,06
217,Business Conference,"Arrived Wednesday 18th March - departed Friday 20th, what a wonderful hotel set in beautiful grounds, the hotel is beautiful the staff couldn't do enough for us. We had a dinner for 100+ guests on Wednesday evening and everyone I spoke to said their food was perfect, I used the gym and spa on the Thursday morning which has fantastic views across the valley beyond a wonderful fountain. I would definitely return and recommend to all.",5,2015,04,02
217,Beautiful location!,"The view surrounding this hotel is breathtakingly beautiful. Gorgeous lush landscape and mountanoues terrain with the sea being only 10 minutes away.
We stayed for 2 nights on a room only deal - even though it was discounted it's still expensive.
The room was very good - spacious with a big bathroom and I loved the tv in there so I could watch it while chilling in the bath.
The actual lay out of the hotel is perfect for the maximising the wonderful views. It looks so grand from both the outside and inside (although still have the right balance of homeliness)!

Food and drink in hotel is also expensive but that is to be expected due to the style of the hotel.
Service was excellent from the front of house staff to the cleaners - all pleasant and eager to please.
We ate in McGillls while watching sport and our food was delicious.

We used the complimentary bikes for a day which was lovely as we went into the village and then down to the waterfall - (definetly recommend this as was beautiful although a tough cycle when on recreational bikes). 

There is plenty of eating options around in the village and within the powerscourt grounds . We also went to johnnies foxes for the evening and it is a fixed rate from hotel €18 each way (foxes is worth a visit).

The pool area is really nice with good spa options (although again pricey for treatments)
I would definetly like to come back to this hotel again although do not think I could personally justify paying the full price per night despite how I enjoyed my time in this wonderful location.",4,2015,03,31
217,A Stunning Hotel,"Wonderful hotel, I just didn't want to leave, fabulous rooms, beautiful grounds, the best Spa! and the staff were just lovely. Thank you Robbie for making us feel so welcome. I would recommend this hotel to anyone and will definitely be back soon I hope",5,2015,03,31
217,"Great room, fantastic meal","Stayed here for my boyfriends birthday and it was excellent. The room was fantastic and so luxurious.  We had lunch in the Irish themed pub by the cast iron fire which was lovely and a great addition to the hotel as it allowed for casual drinks and dining. That evening we had dinner in the restaurant which was fantastic. I have to commend the waiting staff who were excellent and so schooled in their area. It was lovely to be served by people so passionate about the food and wine menu and who weren't afraid to give you their recommendations.
I definitely hope to go back here!",5,2015,03,30
217,Wonderful location and hotel,"The design of this hotel make the best use of a  stunning location. The reception and lounge face 'Sugar Loaf' mountain at Bray. Couldn't be better.
The service at reception when booking and arriving is professional. 
The rooms are large and beautifully decorated. Everything you need is there.
This hotel deserves the 5-star rating and I would happily return again.
I have reviewed the restaurants separately.",5,2015,03,30
217,"""World class"" hotel with charming location","This is a remarkable hotel. The setting is phenomenal with views over the Wicklow mountains and set within the grounds of powers court house. 
I was visiting on business and the hotel did a great job looking after us.
The food is excellent and if your looking for some quite corners to enjoy the surrounds and the device them you'll love it here.
There appeared to be many families also enjoying themselves.
The workout area and Spa are top class.
Make sure you take the time to stroll around outside and visit the local avoca store even for a coffee, it's a 8min walk through the grounds.
The local town of enniskerry is also a short walk and is a fantastic stop for a drink or a coffee or some local pub food.
",5,2015,03,29
217,The very best,"This is by far the best spa and hotel in the country, located in a lovely valley, with spectacular views of the Sugarloaf mountain and next door to the lovely and must see Powerscourt gardens, waterfall and  Enniskerry village. 

Whether looking to chill out, have fun or get fit, it meets the bill. 

Superb and lovely staff, especially in the espa and McGills, and wonderful facilities. Put it on your list. There are two golf courses too. 

And if you're staying and fancy an alternative to the hotels lovely food, (breakfast especially recommended), pop in to visit Massimo and the team in Emilia's in Enniskerry village some evening. ",5,2015,03,29
217,"Remarkable, no doubt","The golf was unparalleled...
The rooms were perfect, particularly after a the flight from the US...
The location is wonderful...

If you can, stay here eat here and play here!

Our family enjoyed everything that this superior resort has to offer.",5,2015,03,28
217,Nice place for a conference,"I was genuinely impressed by this place. In the interests of full disclosure and honesty, I didn't stay here overnight, but attended a couple of days as a conference delegate. As our organisations spend a lot of money during conferences I hold these venues to a high standard and Powerscourt Hotel did not disappoint.
General comfort and service from the hotel was excellent, the WiFi is free and very reliable. They offered to take my bags at reception and offered me a complimentary car ride to the village near by.
Tea and coffee during breaks were great and accompanied by fruit as well as pastries.
The bar food was good, and the views are magnificent.

I have docked one star as the food at lunch for our delegation wasn't great, it was a hot buffet, but the reality was very much a luke warm buffet by the time I got to the serving table. When I returned for desert, the hot food containers had been reloaded and the food was hot again, so the temperature of your food is a matter of luck of the draw.
Also, while lining up for this food, I was in a bottle neck area of the ""McGills Pub"" area and hotel staff kept walking in to me and my friends or asking us to let them pass with their various trays and utensils - I found this a bit intrusive and was surprised it was at all necessary, surely this could be resolved by another door or just widening the access around the bar.",4,2015,03,28
217,Excellent Hotel for All services,"Staying at this hotel  with 3 children rooms were excellent 
Staff  were very friendly in all departments, great if you have children. 
There is a kidsclub run by professional staff from  kidzclub.
Children  entertained for a few hours .Just lovely we both had time to relax 
Lovely facilities, will be back",5,2015,03,27
217,Be Ready For A Squeeze...,"We stayed for two nights in March. We had 2 rooms with connecting doors so we could walk between rooms. The rooms were lovely, I can't complain too much about these. The bathrooms had a TV in the mirror. I'm not sure I have seen anything cooler in a hotel. I enjoyed watching Futurama while I brushed my teeth on arrival. The place was clean and spacious and the service was really good with the exception of the 'bellboy' who was trying to show us how the lights & aircon worked (they are touchscreen pads on the walls) who then noticed one wasn't working, said he'd get it fixed and then never returned or got it fixed. We weren't too bothered though...if we were sticklers it would have been annoying. 

Now to justify my title....be ready for a squeeze. This place is out to get every extra euro, dollar, pound you can spare. €5 charge for room service, €5.50 to see the waterfall (its a thing of nature), €12.50 for a neat whiskey, etc.....there are a few lovely added costs and food, drinks & service is very overly priced.

If you have a lot of money to spend. Go here, enjoy yourself, eat in Sika (extremely expensive for dinner but lovely) enjoy the spa and pool. If you don't have money to burn and you've managed to spot some rooms on the internet at a cut deal price id suggest moving on and going somewhere else because you have zero chance of going here and keeping 'added' costs down. There is no where else to eat but in the two resturants so be prepared to spend!

Point of note, McGill's pub is really great, bit pricey but if you are local to the area for a day or walking or sightseeing i'd suggest popping in there and having a nice pint and some food. Lovely pub.",3,2015,03,27
217,A little piece of Heaven,"I went for a day spa in the Powerscourt Hotel with my mom and I couldn't fault it. The views driving up the avenue to the hotel alone are worth the trip.
I had a massage and facial and even fell asleep because I was so relaxed. I only woke up when Dan (by the way I would highly recommend) gently woke me up after the facial. After my facial I read my book in the serenity area overlooking the amazing views.
The lunch is served in a Bento box style, and portion size is perfect and the food really fantastic quality. We were served by Maria who was very attentive.
If you want to experience a top quality spa day, go to the Powerscourt Hotel, you won't be disappointed.",5,2015,03,27
217,Not the response I expected!!!!!!,"I previously visited the hotel in January with my wife and raved about the hotel itself, and this review still stands!!
My only issue in my January review was with the price of drinks, in particular Cocktails which were priced at the time at €13 each.
The Hotel Manager answered my review and said he had taken my opinion on board and would examine the pricing structure to bring his prices in line.
In March we revisited the hotel and I asked the barman how much were the cocktails now, his answer a STAGGERING €18!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!
That's really NOT the price review I had in mind Mr Manager Sir!!!!!!!
Needless to say, we did not purchase any cocktails!!",2,2015,03,26
217,Excellent!,"What a beautiful hotel! We stayed in one of the suites overlooking the mountains which was beautiful! I loved being on the 4th floor since that was the main floor. The staff was so nice! The pool, hot tub, steam room, workout room was fabulous! There was a pub attached to to hotel which was fun and had live entertainment.",4,2015,03,25
217,Excellent hotel. Perhaps the best Marriott in Europe.,The rooms are spacious and fabulous. The hotel grounds are wonderful and very well maintained. The staff are very friendly and efficient. Only a short distance from the centre of Dublin and well liked by visitors from the USA.,5,2015,03,25
217,Superb,"Just about the best hotel outside of Vegas or Dubai set in idyllic Wicklow, stayed in a suite which was superb, staff great, food great and for a business conference excellent facilities set in the most beautiful grounds, do not hesitate you will be charmed. ",5,2015,03,22
217,Damsel in Distress!,"Arrived to the hotel for my Christmas party and realised I forgot my stilettos! Devastated! Rang reception in a panic to see if there was any way they had a pair of heels in lost property! Ciaran P sorted me right out with a choice of ladies fashionable shoes in all colours and sizes. My hero. Best Christmas party ever!
Thank you Ciaran P!",5,2015,03,22
217,"What a treat, beautiful hotel!","We booked an Irish vacation thru Great Vacations and this hotel was included. Lucky us!! Everyone working for the hotel was so friendly and helpful. A nice drive from Dublin; we missed the turn from the freeway first. We dined in the restaurant for breakfast and the pub for dinner. The suite was superb, very roomy-- an extremely comfy bed, I overslept one morning! Do yourself a favour and do not miss this lovely hotel if you are in the area.",5,2015,03,21
217,Peaceful Retreat! ,"We booked a travel deal through Great Value Vacations and this was the hotel selected. We are big Marriott people anyway so thought it would be fine and it was far better than fine! It was wonderful! The staff had all of our info upon check-in and no problems with that. Our room was amazing. I didn't count on a suite but we got one and it was HUGE. The shower was the best I've ever had in Europe and the bed was so comfy and luxurious. We adored the friendly staff always willing to help us and also really loved sitting by the fireplace and having cocktails in the lobby. The Mcgills pub staff was also superb. I asked if they sold their wine glasses (I loved the etched Powerscourt symbol!) and the bartender just gave me one to take home. So sweet! We also had a massage in the couples suite and both the massage and the use of the suite was fantastic! The only disappointment was the spa pool. It looked so serene and relaxing in there and we planned to hang out after our spa treatment, but there were no available beds by the time we came out and the pool was rather chaotic with children playing and splashing. My only wish was that the spa area was a kid free or at least a quiet zone. Our dinner at Sika was AMAZING!!! The grounds are beautiful and a visit to the gardens is 100% worth it! We also had no problems driving into Dublin in the rental and finding reasonable car parks. We would highly recommend this hotel!! ",5,2015,03,21
217,hotel has made great improvements under new ownership,"the hotel has changed ownership in the last year or so and it has a fresh appeal about it.
we stayed as a family and found the facilities very good. the changes to the dining room is brilliant and is nice and roomy and provides a great Irish Breakfast.
Rooms are of a high standard and the setting is gorgeous
this hotel is a 5 star and not cheap but comes highly recommended",5,2015,03,20
217,An oasis of fabulousness!,"I attended our company conference at Powerscourt last week, what a stunning location! A large group of us all arrived together but the hotel staff not only took it in their stride but were extremely pleasant and friendly. 

The bedrooms were beautiful, palatial, very comfortable and most of all, quiet. Watching TV whilst lounging in the bath was the height of decadence!

Breakfast offered a wonderful variety of treats - definitely recommend the full Irish breakfast. Our conference lunches were not only delicious but also attractively presented.

I would love to come back here on a non-business basis, the staff, on all levels, showed the utmost courtesy whilst displaying that wonderful Irish hospitality that the country is famous for.

I loved it.",5,2015,03,18
217,Relaxing Getaway!!,Loved staying here!!! A lovely get away from Dublin living which is so close by! The staff are all extremely pleasant. very caring and always wanting to offer you the best service. Rare to find a hotel where all the staff try to make your stay as good as possible. Room was huge. Bathroom was beautiful. Breakfast was brilliant. Excellent choice of sports channels. Left my laptop charger in my room and managed to ring once i noticed and had it all taken care of for me by Kieran P. Will definitely be staying again!,5,2015,03,17
217,Fantastic room! Excellent food. ,We paid extra for a suite and were not disappointed. Room was really spacious and perfect for our toddler. Dedicated pool times for children which was great as we didn't feel bad for our noisy child interrupting the tranquility of the pool area. Great variety at breakfast. Had dinner in the 'Irish' bar on both nights and were not disappointed. Food was excellent. We will definitely return. ,5,2015,03,17
217,Perfection,"Stayed here last night - unfortunately only one night - to get away from the madness of Paddies Day in Dublin. And what a treat. The hotel from the lobby to the bar/restaurants to our fabulous room which was huge, was just amazing. Staff are very friendly, polite and helpful. An absolutely magical setting in the Powerscourt Estateit really felt like another world away and was only about a half hour drive from Dublin. Only slight issue was the pillows very flat but that didn't bother my friend at all that was just a personal thing for me. Wouldn't stop me going again, comfy beds, FAB bathroom and just an amazing picturesque setting. Definitely will be back. And make sure you walk over to the Powerscourt Gardens it's only a two minute walk from the hotel and you pay just EUR8.50 in can spend the whole day there.",5,2015,03,17
217,Great weekend,"Hi just back from a really lovely few data in Powerscourt hotel, was really a well looked after the staff are lovely and nothing is a problem. The rooms are very nice and the bat was really good, plenty to do in the area I would rally recommend it.",5,2015,03,17
217,perfection,"This place is expencive but nice for a treat. The rooms are huge with such a comfy bed, I did not want to leave. There is a walk-in wordrobe, a stunning ensuite with shower and bath, tv and all the usual things you would expect. The spa is nice but I must admit, based on the price and star rating I expected something better.It was very basic for such a highprofile place. I have been to better for cheaper. The grounds are beautiful and decor is classic.",5,2015,03,17
217,Amazing birthday weekend,"Booked the hotel for a birthday weekend. Have to say it was an amazing break away from start to finsh. Every single staff member we met couldn't have been nicer or more helpful. The Espa was lovely and a little piece of heaven. 
Only slight negative was the Sika restaurant service did not match the price. I would recommend McGills bar for dinner instead. 
Rooms are amazing and I feel their website photos do not do them justice.",5,2015,03,17
217,Relaxation in a wonderful setting,"One of the many hotels that was on my bucket list and thankfully I got to this gem. Headed there as a bit of a surprise and well worth the journey. 
From the moment we got in the door we were met by the 5 star service with the luggage whisked to the room. The room was quite spacious, overlooking the fountain and Gardens and in the near distance were the Sugar loaf mountains. It was tastefully decorated and plenty of room in our suite for relaxing. 
That evening we eat in the restaurant which was spectacular and plenty of selection to tickle the pallet. Afterwards we retired to the bar for some night caps. 
In the morning the buffet breakfast was served in the same restaurant as the night before, and it met and exceeded the standards attained on the evening before. Later in the morning I headed to the gym and swimming pool. To relax in the large jacuzzi was heavenly, but I found the pool a little on the cool side. 
Overall a great place to spend a weekend and hopefully get there again in the future. ",4,2015,03,17
217,20th Wedding Anniversary,"I thought I would treat us both to a kid-free indulgent weekend of great food, superb service, luxurious accommodation and tremendous scenery.  The Powerscourt Hotel exceeded our expectations in all respects.  The best room (suite 238, huge and opulent) and best pool/spa we have ever had. Top notch food and outstanding service, no matter who we spoke with - at reception, the concierge, housekeeping (to make our bed 'feather-free'), both restaurants and the hotel driver (free transport service into Enniskerry village and back).  We left the hotel to walk around the beautifully manicured gardens, visit the waterfall, visit a local pub and drive around the stunning Wicklow mountains.  The Guinness lake (Lough Tay) really does look like an entire lake of Guinness.  Absolutely delighted with our weekend and, amazingly, it was cheaper than going to the Merchant Hotel in Belfast.",5,2015,03,16
217,One of the best in the world,"A must when in Dublin, staff, food, rooms, spa, grounds all perfect they didn't put a foot wrong. Will be visiting again very soon. A bargain for the quality. Restaurant couldn't be faulted too. If you get the chance make use of the bikes to see the grounds, gardens 
Can't wait to visit again   ",5,2015,03,16
217,Lovely stay,"Spent just one night here after landing in Dublin. The drive out to Enniskerry was easy,but our navigation had a bit of trouble finding the hotel. Luckily, we found a human to point us the way.   Lovely, gracious, and comfortable- first class all the way- done well, without trying too hard. We were eager to stretch our legs a bit and enjoy the beautiful setting.  Robby our concierge suggested a stroll down into town for a pint at Macs @ Powerscourt Arms.  They'd even send a shuttle down to fetch us when we were ready to return. (We chose to walk back)  Winner suggestion! 
We grabbed a bite of dinner in the pub. It was hopping on a Thursday night- looked like locals and tourist alike.  Food was great! Especially liked the venison and boar pie. 
Later we went for a soak in the pool and jacuzzi at the spa.  Really nice and relaxing. 
We enjoyed a lovely stay, only made better by using Marriott points. I do hope we have a chance to return again- truly it was a highlight!",5,2015,03,16
217,SUPERB,"We stayed at the Powerscourt hotel for one night midweek on a cracking bed and breakfast offer via a popular website. We never expected to be staying at this hotel for the price we got it. It used to be a clean fortune so it was great to get a deal. The setting is very impressive in the lovely powerscourt estate with views of the wicklow mountains. There are two golf courses, gardens, avoca cafe and shops and scenic walks. 
Carparking is right beside the front door. No need to pay for valet parking. The foyer is impressive with rich wood and marble in abundance. The reception staff are excellent and very friendly then the attendant takes you and your bags off to the room. 
Wow. The biggest hotel room we have ever had. Touch control panels for everthing. Double doors to the bathroom which is bigger than our own masterbedroom! Marble everywhere with a neat tv built into the mirror. Large bath, twin sinks, and excellent walkin shower. 
There is a walkin dresser type area with 2x wardrobes including safe and a foreign electric currency changer. A first!!
The bedroom itself is massive. In fact it could do with more furniture just to fill it out a bit. The bed is 7 ft wide and really comfy. Tv has plenty of channels plus pay to view movies. 
We put our robes and slippers on and went to the spa for a dip in the most stunning pool. It is black mosaic tiles with a few crystal type tiles sparkling here and there under the dimmed lighting. It really is class. The hot spa area is good and plenty of soft loungers are around the pool if you fancy a rest. The changing rooms are spacious and well equiped with modern lockers, swimwear dryers and lots of fresh soft towels. 
The gym looked very good and can be excessed 24 hrs with the room key. 
Just a thing which I've remembered. Even the elevators have small crystal chandaliers.
We had dinner in the Irish themed bar. It was very good fresh wholesome fare and probably what you expect to pay in most hotels. 
Breakfast in the main restaurant was excellent. My wife rated it as one of the best she has had in any hotel. Everything was fresh and the homemade breads were great as was the fruit and the little musili cocktails. Nice touch. 
The views from the restaurant are amazing looking out towards the suger loaf mountain. 
We also discovered that we could have brought the young children free as well if we had the twin room and kids are permitted in the pool at certain times which is nice for families. 
We loved the Powerscourt and highly recommend it. Will be back with the clan!",5,2015,03,11
217,A little bit of luxury close to Dublin.,"This stunning hotel is a short spin from the City Centre, it's location provides stunning views of Sugar Loaf mountain. It oozes class & elegance with its amazing interiors that have a feel of opulence. Staff are well groomed & it is obvious from the onset that staff are a dedicated to providing 5* service, they are proactive & extremely attentive. The restaurant was being renovated so we choice to explore the village of 'Enniskerry' The hotel runs a chauffeur service to & from the village. The Bar, McGills is a traditional Irish bar, ideal for a night cap. Our room was fantastic! Spacious & luxurious & a real treat! We availed of the hotel leisure facilities, fabulously relaxing & every need has been pre-emted. 
Thos hotel is a real treat!",5,2015,03,10
217,When it was the Ritz-Carlton...,"This hotel was 2nd to none when it was the Ritz-Carlton. We stayed here 5 times and got married (we are from the U.S.) here.

The service is beyond compare, the restaurant (was a Gordon Ramsey restaurant) was exceptional! Having a pub downstairs (McGill's) was great for a late night drink and to watch the game. The SugarLoaf Lounge was lovely to have a drink and overlooked the Sugarloaf Mountains. You sit in a luxary setting and just feel at peace. Another important reason we kept coming back was ESPA! The spa that has no equal! The treatments you receive here were amazing. I have yet to have a hot stone massage like I had in Enniskerry. The pool lit up with thousands of crystals, the hammam and just the numerous treatments made the entire trip wonderful. Oh, the relaxation rooms were great also! How could I forget about those. The town of Enniskerry is quaint also and good to grab a meal down there also.",5,2015,03,09
217,Amazing property,Even in the cold damp spring weather this is an amazing place.  You live like the ancient royalty that originally settled the area and built the nearby castle.  If you want a relaxing and beautiful vacation this is the place.  Do treat yourself to an upgraded suite.  They are very spacious with two separate rooms plus a huge bath and a very large walk in wardrobe that is big enough for a bedroom.  It is isolated and accessible only by very narrow country lanes which means you really eat all your meals at the hotel which can get a little pricey.  The nearby village of Enniskerry is tiny and quaint but not a lot going on.,5,2015,03,09
217,5 star prices but a 4 star experience!,"Booked a weekend away with friends & booked 2 rooms each with 2 double beds. The rooms were very spacious, comfortable & very well laid out. Our only complaint here was there were no plugs positioned  next to a mirror in order to use a hairdryer & the hotel hairdryer was located behind a bathroom mirror positioned  over the sink!! We ordered our breakfasts to the room on our first morning & it was excellent. Similar to previous reviews there were a number of ""callers"" to the room to offer us complimentary water etc. 

We dined in the sika restaurant for dinner on the saturday evening and we could not fault it - the food was superb.  We decided on Sunday morning as we had spa treatments booked, to have our breakfast down in the sika restaurant. The hotel had placed a letter at our bedroom door the previous evening  to say that breakfast was extended to 12 and check-out till 1pm which we were very pleased with. We had our spa treatments & headed down for breakfast at 11am to find a number of people waiting around outside the Sika restaurant. We approached the desk & we were asked for our room number and were told that ""it would be a few seconds as they were waiting for guests to leave and free up some tables""! I could clearly see that there were a number of tables free but which had ""dirty "" dishes on them. This was very evidently a staffing issue. We had to wait nearly 10 minutes until we were seated & we couldnt have been further away fom the ""buffet"".  This has to be my first experience in all my travels where i was asked to wait for a table for breakfast!!! It turned out to be a completely opposite breakfast experience to the morning before The ""buffet"" iself was the worst buffet I have come across.  It was positioned in a small corner at the far end of the restaurant. They ran out of pastries, poor selection of breads & when we ordered our eggs from our very obliging & helpful waiter 'Daniel' they were cold.  

We were approached by the manager on duty and we relayed our frustrations - she said that the restaurant had just re-opened following re-decoration and they were trying to get used to the new layout & furniture!! I told her it was evident that they had a staffing issue also - when we left the restaurant she thanked us for our 'feedback' & said there was a 'surprise' waiting for us in our room. It was some nicely wrapped macaroons accompanied by a hand written card from 'management' - it was a nice gesture.

Overall we enjoyed our stay here but there are a few issues this very well & comfortable hotel need to sort out particularly when they are charging five star prices!! The majority of staff are very friendly and service was excellent.

I a writing this review as there were no 'comment cards' in our room or no other forum to leave a review or rating.",4,2015,03,09
217,What a luxurious hotel,"It was the first time to visit this property. My 2 kids, my wife and I stayed in a two double bed room which was the biggest room we had ever before. The bathroom was very big and full of amenities and it had bathrobes. We stayed three nights and we enjoyed our time in the pool every day. The staff was very friendly and helpful. The bellman offered help upon arrival and departure with our luggage. We also enjoyed our breakfast which was very nice and had a lot of varieties. The kids also liked the cycling in the river walk area.",5,2015,03,08
217,"5 star hotel, 4 star experience","Firstly, this is a first class hotel. The rooms are great (we did splash out on a suite). Comfortable, spacious, spotlessly clean, hi-tec. All good.

We enjoyed the leisure facilities too, nice pool area.

Staff seemed helpful and friendly.

Our only criticism is the restaraunt experience, or non experience. Sika was closed the weekend we were there and everyone had to eat in the lounge area, which is ok but the menu was so pedestrian. Like a fancy carvery really.  

A first world problem I get that but we really did splash out to stay for our 2nd anniversary, for a 5 star, they could have tried far harder to have a better menu. The food was absolutely fine, just nothing that you couldn't have anywhere else any other day. 

That said, we did leave relaxed after our stay. 

Obviously 5 star prices but that is to be expected.",4,2015,03,06
217,One night of Bliss,"Stayed here for 1 x night with my Mother and Daugher for one night getaway from the city.  Was a bit lost so was delighted to find the driveway up to the hotel.  This is not an exaggeration but I thought of ""Manderley"" as I was driving in.  You will have to know the book ""Rebecca"" to appreciate the reference.  Anyway it was beautiful, a nice mistly cold February afternoon.
The staff were very welcoming, the room was nice and warm.  We did not need help with luggage as we only had overnight bags.  Had a nice light afternoon meal in the Sugar Loaf Lounge after checking out our room and exploring a little.  The Bar was open at around 6pm and by the time we found it, it was quite packed.  So we just had tea in Reception, still quite full from our afternoon snack.
The fires were lit and it was warm and cosy in the reception area, would be really romantic and intimate if you went as a couple.  Sat there quite happily for an hour or so just people watching and relaxing.  Retired early.  The room, bathroom, beds could not be faulted (Mirror in Bathroom excellent idea).  Walk in shower.  Dont like the idea of pay per view movies, but once you have your laptop, phone, tablet, good company, you are fine who needs TV. Complimentary mineral water provided by Housekeeping.  Did not use mini bar.  All the staff were very helpful, even when we moved tables in the lounge to get a better view of the Sugar Loaf.
Had breakfast the next morning in the Sika Restaurant (well worth it (€22.00) the choice was endless, again unhurried and excellent service. Did not avail of the Spa as my Mother is quite elderly.
Would I go again, definitely yes. Go enjoy the experience!! Loved it.",5,2015,03,04
217,Amazing customer service but room very disappointing,"Booked a Saturday night here as a birthday treat for my girlfriend. At arrival we were advised there was no bath in the room (which I thought odd but accepted) - it turned out to be a disabled friendly room - not sure why we couldn't have been advised this at check-in... I wouldn't have minded but again odd that they'd deliberated avoid sayng this, like we wouldn't notice.

In the room less than an hour before we were disturbed by someone checking the mini-bar, he returned again about 30 mins later to restock. We were then disturbed by a maid dropping off some bottles of water... no idea why this wasn't all done before we checked in at 4pm.

Attempted to shower before dinner - only had about 30 seconds of lukewarm water then cold. Reception sent an engineer who suggested a valve may be broken and it couldn't be fixed until the next day. Reception offered to move our bags into a twin room while we were at dinner - as we were already 40 mins late I advised I would deal with this later. We took cold showers and headed to dinner. I then spoke to reception who advised the alternative  room previously offered didn't actually exist as it was assigned to a wedding guest who may or may not check in later - we would be stuck with the cold water.

Headed to the bar where there were no seats available as several empty tables were reserved for the wedding guests. Returned to our room and to get ready for bed. The wall beside the bed is lined with wardrobes which light up when open - nice idea. Unfortunately for us they stay lit when closed - even when all other lights are off. In fact the wardrobe doors appear to be fitted incorrectly and don't touch the off switch when closed. A girl from reception was sent up and after many efforts got some of the light off by taping over the buttons - this was 2 am. (this was seriously becoming a Fawlty Towers experience). One bright light remained on all night as it had no off button to take over. Apart from disturbing our sleep, I consider lights which heat up and can't be switched off to be a fire hazard.

Another minor point was the the electronic controls for the room included buttons to open and close the curtains - these did not work. I'm quite happy to manually open curtains but that fact that the controls didn't work was just another sign of how shoddy these rooms are. 

On the positive side the staff were amazing and friendly and did everything in their power to mitigate for the problems. Dinner in the Sugar Loaf restaurant was one of the best meals I've had in ages. Our bill was substantially reduced and we were gifted a lovely bottle of wine (they checked with the restaurant and gave us the one we ordered with dinner - a nice touch). The communal areas of the hotel are beautiful. 

Despite this, the minimum I expect even from a cheap B&B is a hot shower and a good nights sleep - neither of which were available at Powerscourt. Overall a disappointing experience.",2,2015,03,04
217,Perfect hideaway in a truly special corner of Ireland only a short hop from the capital,"We checked in for that all important rest between Christmas and New year. It ticked all the boxes. The rooms are spacious and very comfortable but make sure you get one with a view. The hotel was very full but is big enough to take the numbers so it works for all types of visitors , couples, families etc. the food is in restaurant reflects perfectly the surroundings with a strong focus on local ingredients and suppliers. The highlight for me was the spa . Simply stunning, separate relaxation area for those with booked treatments, a fantastic range of treatments and really thoughtful service. ",4,2015,03,03
217,Excellent property,"This is a beautiful property with luxurious rooms. The staff is very knowledgeable. All restaurants are superb. They are very much into farm to table so everything is fresh. Located close by is the quaint town of Enniskerry.  Dublin is an hour train ride away.  We always stay here, we love it.",5,2015,03,02
217,Fabulous Hotel - Needs a paint!,"I adore this hotel - I have loved it since it opened as the Ritz Carlton! It has a nicer, warmer, more-welcoming atmosphere since it has become Powerscourt Hotel! The rooms are fabulous - from the amazing bathroom to the stunning views to the spacious, comfortable bedroom. The food was fabulous! The staff around the hotel were friendly and polite. The hotel is gorgeous and in such a luxurious setting. The spa is to die-for! 

Have stayed in the hotel three times and last stay was a bit disappointing - although still wonderful! For a 5-star, there were a few minor disappointments. The reason for the 4/5 stars is that the service was very slow in both McGills Irish pub and The Sugar Loaf lounge - we had to ask for the bill three times in The Sugar Loaf and twice in McGills. We also had to re-order our dessert in McGills as they never brought it out the first time. The wait-staff didn't seem to be 5-star trained. Also, the hot-pool beside the swimming pool was nearly cold - I don't know if it was broken or if it's been changed to a cooler heat! One of my the main things I've noticed is that the hotel from the outside is starting to look a bit grubby and dirty from the elements and could do with a paint-job or clean up! 

All in all, a fabulous hotel! Definitely worth a stay! ",4,2015,02,28
217,Only 45 mins from Dublin City Centre,"Fantastic hotel located just outside Dublin. Great spa, pub, golf, local village and great staff. Rooms are great with TVs in the bathrooms which is a nice little luxury. Lovely Shops on the grounds with Avoca within a 5 minute walk of the hotel ",5,2015,02,28
217,"Great escape, hotel is fab!","Stayed here for one night in October 2014. After requesting a room with a balcony, when checking in the very polite receptionist informed us we had been upgraded to a superior room. Room was top notch, everything was perfect with amazing views from the balcony. The pool area was wonderful and very relaxing. Although it's quite pricey, it's totally worth the money! can't wait to go back.",5,2015,02,27
217,Great escape,"We stayed here with our  teenagers on New Year's Day 2015. The hotel was very busy and because of weddings/ festivities of the previous night, rooms were not ready on our arrival. Had we not phoned ahead that morning and enquired as to the most suitable time for arrival and then added an hour, I may not have been so peeved by the request ( when we eventually got to the top of the queue for check-in) to find somewhere to sit and wait until the room was ready, which they assured us would only be half an hour. There was NOWHERE to sit! The hotel was still really busy and it was suggested ( rather rudely by the one of the staff at reception), that we go to the pub and wait there! Now let's be honest, two weary adults and accompanying children were not in the mood to sit downstairs on bar stools, fortunately the fantastic young manager at the Sugar loaf spotted us and offered us complimentary coffee and a table there while we were waiting.....and boy , did we wait! One hour and twenty minutes later we got a call saying that our room was now ready and when I questioned the length of time that it had taken, the young man from check in had the audacity to say he had been trying for ages to reach us on my husbands number ( he had gone to a spa appointment) and got a little embarrassed when I told him that he hadn't as I had BOTH phones! Anyway, to cut a long story short the reason that I have still given the hotel 4 stars is that the suite was gorgeous, the beds Devine and the food, both in the restaurant and at breakfast, fantastic. I would recommend a visit and we will be back....and hopefully will be in our rooms in a jiffy!",4,2015,02,24
217,Wowza.... This hotel is amazing,"My husband and I were very lucky to actually have gotten a huge upgrade when we stayed here (due to Mariott hold status) and the room we had was the nicest room we've ever had in our entire lives. It. Was. GORGEOUS. And huge. Separate sitting room, bedroom, and dressing room, and a bathroom bigger than my whole master bedroom at home. Gorgeous wood flooring. Incredible linens. Just amazing. 

The grounds are just indescribably beautiful. We could have spent days just wandering the grounds. 

Also, the pub downstairs was truly and sincerely the best irish food we had in our whole trip to Ireland. 

Truly, truly the best hotel stay that we've ever had ",5,2015,02,24
217,Wonderful experience,"Myself and my boyfriend stayed int he hotel for one night as part of the Grown-Up Getaway deal and it was truly amazing value. A three course meal in Sika and full buffet breakfast were included. Upon arrival we were upgraded to a Mountain View room which was such a treat with stunning views and a gorgeous marble bathroom. We availed of the bike renting facility for a cycle around the grounds which was very enjoyable. All staff we encountered were extremely friendly & helpful.

Only downside was on Saturday afternoon the pool area was a bit chaotic with so many children & toys about the place, but this is to be expected on the weekend of a school bank holiday and didn't take away from the experience overall. When we went again on Sunday morning we practically had the pool, jacuzzi and steam room area to ourselves. I did not use the Spa on this occasion but I recently visited it in January and it was also exceptional. If the offer is run again we will definitely return, it really was a pleasure.",5,2015,02,24
217,WOW - couldn't have been more impressed!,"Actually, we booked this because we had the Marriott points to do so and it was a part of Ireland we hadn't seen.  Turns out it was one of the best places we've ever stayed!  We were upgraded to a giant suite because of a convention going on - what a treat!  We felt like royalty.  Absolutely everyone we dealt with was friendly and went above and beyond.  If you have a chance to stay here - PLEASE DO!  The grounds/gardens are exquisite - among the best we have ever seen.  I cannot say enough good things about this hotel.  Everything about it is lovely!",5,2015,02,23
217,Such a nice break away!,"Stayed here for two nights mid February with my girlfriend we had a spacious mountain Veiw room on the sixth floor with a balcony, i could not fault the room in anyway it was spotless and really comfortable. The food in the sika Restraunt  is to die for and the service is second to none! Peter served us all night and done his very best to make sure we made the most of our evening, the pool was also very relaxing and the spa manager was very helpful and dealt with any queries in a very professional and courteous manor, personally i was not a major fan of the bar bit again the staff there were excellent, check in I though was a bit rushed but they were very busy when we arrived so it's to be expected! I will definitely return here sometime in the near future. ",5,2015,02,23
217,Beautiful Hotel and Grounds,Powerscourt hotel was fantastic we stayed during the weekend so it was very busy and had a lovely atmosphere! Room was exceptional and very large. The pool area was very peaceful. Only flaw was the rude receptionist at check in however the rest of the staff couldn't have been more helpful.,4,2015,02,22
217,A 'Treat' of a Hotel and Spa,"The hotel is set in a fantastic and very magical setting overlooking the sugarloaf mountain in the 'Garden of Ireland', Wicklow. This is 5 star all the way. The staff were very accommodating and helpful. The spa was first class and the pool and relaxation rooms were a pleasure. The Sika restaurant was heavenly and the food was very appetising. The Powerscourt House and gardens are located within a two minute walk from the hotel and is a  must see part of any visit to the hotel. The golf course just doesn't get any better. All in all an incredible experience but definitely not a budget option! ",5,2015,02,22
217,Back to its former glory!,"Stayed at the hotel with my wife yesterday and was pleasantly surprised by the level of service, and overall feeling of true class. I've always loved the hotel from the first time it opened under the Ritz Carlton name but have been dissatisfied over the last couple of years at how it had lost its charm. Thankfully all has been restored, and look forward to our next visit. We had a fabulous meal in Sika and drinks at McGills, love the place, a must for all who appreciate true quality.",5,2015,02,21
217,Luxury,"Reception very helpful.
Took ride on bikes down by private river. 
Had some peaceful times in pool without kids.
Bedroom spacious.  Bath water could have been hotter.
Beds comfortable. 
Clean. 
Lounge area classy but not stuck up.
 No muesli for breakfast. .but the food was good.
Never had a steak cooked properly to my request of blue except here! Chef take a bow.
Cahors wine recommended by waiter at house wine price as he did not have the €29 sicilian red. Very good choice.
Their breads at dinner are good but too much salt in the white bacon sundried tomato and cheese. I know this because the helpful waiter gave me the printed recipe. 
Great catering staff.
Will be back!

217,Fantastic,"Service was excellent.  The car from the airport was pretty pricey, but they offered a free ride into the small town which had a neat authentic pub.  The gardens at powers court where fantastic.  The hotel has a nice bar and pub that was active at night.",5,2015,02,18
217,Beautiful Hotel,Stayed in this hotel Valentine's weekend arriving on the Sunday our room wasnt ready when we arrived but when we got to our room we were delighted room faboulous with a balcony we had dinner in the sika restraunt was faboulous my partner was exceptionally delighted with the duck our waiter peter was lovely. Spa was faboulous we were told when booking the hotel that we could have full access to the thermal suite which we didn't but we felt the manager of spa handeled it very professionally offering us to go up on our second day there. Over all Happy with the hotel :),4,2015,02,18
217,5 star product with 5 star friendliness,"Stayed here with my husband on Friday the 13th nothing unlucky here. Our suite was pure luxury a total delight. We ate at a lovely table in the restaurant that evening, The food was beautifully prepared as you would expect in a 5 star but the real delight and the abiding memory was the wonderful service provided by our waiter Ricardo. Everything carried out with professionalism of course but the genuine smile and the willingness to go the extra mile for his customers left us warm inside Thank you and well don to the whole team.",5,2015,02,18
217,Exceptional ,"The setting, the hotel, the rooms just first class. Well worth staying for more than one night to enjoy the hotel. Service excellent and staff very friendly. 
Food is what you would expect. 
The best of everything has been put into this hotel, no expense spared ",5,2015,02,17
217,Not what I expect from a 5 star,"I recently stayed in the famous 5 star hotel in Powerscourt and I was quite disappointed especially for the price that's expected to be paid for the room. 

Upon arrival I requested a bucket of ice for the room. It never arrived. When we were shown to our room we noticed a damp smell but thought the room might just need some air as the smell wasn't noticeable the further we walked in to the room. 

The fridge provided wasn't working and drinks inside it were warm. At first I thought a new batch of drinks were placed there and would take some time to chill but after I had ordered room service and decided to have a nice cold drink from the fridge I noticed that after nearly 4 hours the drinks had not chilled at all. Luckily I had asked for an ice bucket (for the second time) so it wasn't too bad but when I mentioned it to the porter he told me he'd have someone take a look at it right away but no one came. 

At breakfast while I was chatting to my partner the girl cleaning the tables basically cut between us to take a glass off the table because she ""couldn't get around the other way"". I felt this was very rude and if she had asked if we were finished I would have gladly handed the glass to her.

After checking out of the hotel I mentioned my issues in a polite and quiet manner so there wouldn't be a scene but the guy at reception pretty much laughed and said he'd ""take it on board"". 

Very bad experience all round.",2,2015,02,17
217,Breathtaking location,"My husband and I stayed here for a week. We felt like we were living the lifestyles of the rich and famous. We had a suite that was huge. We paid for an upgrade to have a mountain view that was totally worth it! Rooms were elegantly appointed and very comfortable beds. The temperature is set in the rooms, so we had to open a window during the nights so we wouldn't get over heated.  The staff was very helpful and friendly. I used the pool and jacuzzi in the evenings and it was delightful.
Walked next door to Avoca for a meal or snack. Great area to walk and take in the sights.",5,2015,02,15
217,Irish style: international standard,"First time in Ireland ... Please don't miss this amazing hotel ! Everything is perfect : room is huge and confortable, what you need you can find it out by style and right tecnology device. Natural park around is wide and landscape is unique. Food is ok .. Issues ??? Yes, one two days are too few for this place .",5,2015,02,14
217,fantastic!!!,"In one word fantastic, from the moment we arrived on the 13/02/15 till when we left the following day.
The service is second to none  they don't cut corners everything is done to perfection the mountain view suit was at a very high standard with stunning views, we felt sorry we didn't book for 2 nights to experience the fabulous Espa.
We had a beautiful dinner in the Sika restaurant with proper service from a very good waiter ""Ricardo"" who entertained our table to a very high standard and yet very informal. 
Can't wait to go back there again.",5,2015,02,14
217,Excellent Luxury hotel,"I stayed in powerscourt hotel last week with my wife and 2 year old. Beautiful large rooms very well equipped. Lovely food in the irish bar and the spa is great. 
We enjoyed the hotel so much we have booked again for April. 5 Stars!!",5,2015,02,12
217,Great spot for Afternoon Tea,"Experienced Afternoon Tea at Powerscourt recently - celebratig a friends birthday. At the time of booking I mentioned we would be celebrating her birthday and it was acknowledged with a birthday plate of petit fours, nice touch. It was also nice to get a confirmation call the day previous.

Service was good particularly when we were seated - the Lounge Manager explained the whole Afternoon Tea ritual - well explaned and a nice experience. Great quality crockery and the best tea leaves I've ever had actually (with many choices)

Service followed swiftly with the servers presenting the tea set and explaining it again. 
Scones, sandwiches and pastries were all excellent as was the dessert trolley choices.

The view from the lounge is really nice - a great place for Afternoon Tea - try it, you wont be dissapointed!",4,2015,02,11
217,Gorgeous!,"Stayed one night (7th Feb) in a resort view suite. Gorgeous hotel with fantastic views. The suite was huge and decorated beautifully-loved the bathroom, especially the tv in the mirror! 
We used the pool/steamroom and we were very impressed. Ate in mc gills pub, food was fab, drinks were very expensive-€10 for a vodka tonic and €5.90 for a pint! To be expected though I suppose. Breakfast in the sugar loaf lounge was fantastic with a gorgeous view. 
Hope to return very soon!",5,2015,02,11
217,Great Lunch in Restaurant,Called in for lunch whilst touring the area and stopping off in Enniskerry - very pleased we did - nice food surroundings and made very welcome by the staff. Nice lunch selection and reasonably priced - well presented and tasted great - pity we couldn't have stayed as well. ,5,2015,02,11
217,Great location shame about the service,"Great location, decor mixed, staff need training, arrogant at front desk, waiting staff appear all student type, why did I have to go to the bar to order a bottle of wine after sitting for 20 minutes in the Irish bar?

Night away was a family gift, yet was charged to my card, matter resolved eventually on check out but if I had arranged this for a business client????  Not good enough.",3,2015,02,09
217,Absolute bliss...!,"Whisked away to Powerscourt for a Birthday Treat with the girls…absolute heaven! 

Rooms were fabulous (as always!)…

Breakfast delicious…

Staff – total 5 star…

Spa – heaven…

I’d definitely recommend a visit! 

Thanks to Ian in the Bar for the bubbles...! 

Special thanks to Chief Concierge Robbie and Suzy in Reservations for their attention to detail and for organising everything for us down to a T! 

We’ll definitely be back! :-)",5,2015,02,09
217,The Powerscourt Hotel is tremendous!,"We had the pleasure of staying in the Powerscourt Hotel last week and had a wonderful time! Our room was beautiful, the food was fantastic (we ate in all of their restaurants), and the spa was stunning. 

Above all, the staff is extremely helpful. Concierge staff, Liz and Steffan, helped us all week booking tours and arranging rides.

I highly recommend!",5,2015,02,09
217,Excellent spa,"Great place for a day spa or just a walk in the country and swim. Or a great afternoon tea treat. Particularly good at Christmas with beautiful decor and ambience. Good selection of restaurants and in beautiful surroundings. If you are travelling without kids make sure you spend time in the relaxation room. And if you are travelling with kids, check the pool policy as kids are only allowed swim at certain times.",5,2015,02,08
217,A Jewel in Wicklows Crown,"Of all the hotels my husband and I have stayed in this beautiful hotel is one of the best worldwide and is deserving of every one of its five stars.It sits nestled on the edge of the stunningly beautiful Powerscourt House and Gardens steeped in history and which also accomodates some quaint shops and cafes. The Spa has the most stunning pool with its Swarovski crystal lights in the pool glistening through the navy blue waters. I'm relaxed just thinking about it. The food the service the rooms, are just all amazing. What more can I say. Go!! You will love your stay. I/we just love love love it! Been three times and hoping to go again very soon. Enjoy!!!!",5,2015,02,08
217,Wonderful visit in stunning surroundings,"We decided to treat ourselves to a few nights away and were not disappointed with our choice. Checked into a suite on the 6th floor with a terrace over looking the fountain and Sugar Loaf Mountain. The room was everything expected from this standard of hotel  and I could quite happily never have left. We headed down to the lobby lounge for a much needed late lunch and drinks, not a huge selection but we opted for the fish and chips and the falafel wrap. Both were tasty, but DH was still hungry, I had thankfully ordered a portion of chips with my wrap. The dessert trolley was presented and looked tasty, DH made his choice and quickly finished it. A cocktail was now on order and at 19 euro I was going to make sure I enjoyed it. In all worked out quite a pricey lunch, not sure the view justified it. 
Breakfast the next morning was full of everything you could want and helped set us up for our morning walk. We also enjoyed a leisurely swim after our stroll and the pool area did everything to invite you in and spend the day. Very nice indeed. 
We thought we'd give McGills a try for lunch today, unfortunately it didn't open until 6pm, so it was back to the lobby bar for lunch again. DH went for the Chicken dish, he said it was more filling than the fish, and as a vegetarian I opted for the soup, as much as I like falafel two days in a row was a no. We managed to get into McGills later on for a pint, and you could be forgiven for forgetting you where in a hotel, nice atmosphere and from other patrons the food looked lovely. Next time we'll plan better and eat in there. 
We will definitely be back, it was 2 nights of luxury and that always does the soul good. ",5,2015,02,08
217,A great stay,"A great hotel, spotlessly clean, beautifully appointed and set in a stunning location. Rooms are spacious with walk in wardrobes, luxurious bathrooms with separate loo and shower cubicles, lovely Espa bath products, large fluffy towels and a TV that appears on the bathroom mirror! The communal area exude space and luxury. The spa is a fabulous space to spend time in whether to work out or relax. Highlights are a huge gym with floor to ceiling windows that overlook the fountains and the Sugar Loaf mountain and the beautiful large indoor pool, with low lighting. The separate male/female ""heat experiences"" are also great and there is a communal steam room just off of the swimming pool area too. We didn't have any spa treatments so am unable to comment on those. Breakfast is terrific with a large offering with good service. A la carte options can also be prepared. This hotel is spotlessly clean which of course is a must for any hotel but not everywhere can live up to it. This hotel does.  A few niggles; the turndown service is hit and miss and needs to be consistent - possibly a training issue? Calling Reception/Housekeeping/Concierge often involved a bit of wait and once or twice an answerphone service kicked in. Once through though things were actioned quickly. We didn't eat in Sika but enjoyed several meals in McGills which really does manage to appear more of a pub rather than an area of a large hotel with a nice buzz about it (depending on the night you eat there). The hotel is just a few minutes walk from Powerscourt House and Gardens and a two minute drive to the small village of Enniskerry. A car is essential as the hotel is remote (although only 25 minutes from Dublin). My view is this hotel is lovely for a relaxing break suitable for couples, families or small groups as well as being suitable for those on business. A great stay and will definitely come back.",4,2015,02,07
217,Magical,"I am not one ounce Irish, and really did not have a desire to go to Ireland, but I did for business. My travel colleagues were a sheer misery to be stuck with, but the Ritz Carlton Powerscourt made everything all right. The grounds are amazing, the fountains and life size lawn chess set incredible. The smell from the black ""bricks"" made of peat moss in the fireplace I can't forget (they let me take some home....). 

Highly recommended.",5,2015,02,07
217,Weekend stay at Powerscourt - disastrous experience,"We stayed for a weekend in Powerscourt Hotel in January 2015.  On Saturday, having been out all day, we returned to the hotel at 6pm to find the room had not been cleaned.  We have stayed in several four and five star hotels in Ireland, and have never had that experience.  In a five star hotel, five star service means that a housekeeper checks to ensure that all rooms have been cleaned on a daily basis.  Furthermore, there was no bottled water supplied in the room which a standard offering in four and five star hotels.  In the Irish pub, which was part of the hotel, the staff couldn't have been more unwelcoming, over-officious and lacking manners.  We were unable to get something as simple as a toasted sandwich in the lounge that evening, so we had to resort to ordering room service in our bedroom to get the sandwich instead.

On the morning of our departure, we complained about all of the above points to the receptionists on duty, who were in no way apologetic or contrite about the situation.  In answer to the room not being cleaned, they said that maybe it was a mistake.

Five star quality in any hotel means five star service, and judging from our experience that weekend, I wouldn't give it two stars.  We will be staying in Adare Manor at Easter and I we shall be comparing five star service.",1,2015,02,06
217,Superb rooms. Real luxury. ,"My review is based on a one night stay (Sunday night) as a couple.

 

Location: Powerscourt hotel is a short drive from the M50 so fairly easily accessible. The signposts closer to the hotel can be hard to spot sometimes so just look out for the brown signs.

 

Entrance: The entrance to the hotel is through a long avenue towards Powerscourt gardens. As soon as you pull in, you can feel the road behind you and the hustle and bustle of Dublin disappear.

 

Checkin: We were welcomed by a very friendly girl called Cheara I think. We were lucky enough to get early checkin. From checkin you are shown to your room and given a quick run through of the room especially the very cool touch pad controls for lights and curtains and a/c. 

 

Rooms: We decided to upgrade to the Mountain View Suite. It was an additional €60 from the standard room. And all I can say is that it is worth it. The room is approx. 750 sq ft. which is close enough to the size of some city centre apartments. At the entrance it has a toilet and plenty of wardrobe space which actually contained a transformer so foreign guests could use their appliances. I don’t recall ever seeing this in a hotel before so that’s pretty impressive. From the entrance hall you enter the living area which is similar in size to most our living rooms. The icing on the cake was the large windows facing out towards the beautiful mountain view. There is also a balcony out which stretches the length of the hotel with its arching curve. It’s not a private balcony but they are separated by garden furniture. Some of the paving was a bit loose on the balcony which should really be fixed but it didn’t take away from the view. The living area has a lovely desk, minibar and TV. Off the living room separated by sliding doors is the bedroom with massive marble bathroom containing twin sinks, bath, separate shower room with rainforest shower and separate toilet. Oh to have that at home. Oh, and you can’t forget the TV built into the mirror. A large walk in wardrobe is just off the bedroom too. I think you’d want a lot of suitcases to fill all the wardrobes! A large king size bed was in the room. It’s quiet a soft bed which I wasn’t expecting and normally don’t like but it was like lying on a mountain full of cotton wool, covered in fluffy clouds! If only I could of fit the bed in my suitcase. Overall the room is probably the nicest room I have stayed in in a hotel. It’s fair to say it’s what probably made the stay for me.

 

Dining: Sika is the main dining room but we didn’t dine there as it’s more fine dining and not really what I’m into. They also have the Sugar Loaf which is where the Afternoon Tea is served but also do evening meals. We didn’t eat there as the menu was  a bit limited and I don’t think it’s really ideal for dinner even though the view is overlooking the mountains. It’s too open and close to the lobby for my liking. It would be ideal for afternoon tea which seems very popular there. We ate in McGills which is their onsite bar. I had read mixed reviews about it but I can happily say I was pleased with it. We both had the fish and chips which we really enjoyed. The desserts were nice, nothing amazing but nice. Main was €19, and desserts €9. Accepting it is a 5* hotel and that prices are naturally going to be higher, I feel it may be a slight bit too high for bar food. The bar itself is very nice with very friendly and professional staff.

Breakfast was included in our rate and is served in Sika. The selection of food is excellent and I especially loved the brown bread. I ordered the eggs benedict which was nice. The other hot food at the buffet wasn’t very hot so this was the biggest disappointment of the stay. Even though it is quieter for a Monday, a 5* hotel should always having piping hot food.

 

Leisure Centre: There is a considerable size gym there and a 20m pool. There’s a Jacuzzi and steam room although this was out of order on the day I was there.

 

Overall, I really enjoyed this hotel and would probably rate it in my top 5 hotels I have stayed in worldwide. Hopefully I’ll get back again for a longer stay.

217,Excellent hotel ,"Stayed in the mountain view suite with a friend for a special occasion. Beautiful room with separate sitting room, large bathroom with tv in the mirror and dressing room. The balcony was huge with breathtaking views over enniskerry mountain. There was sun loungers on it and as it was so warm we lay on them for a while in such lovely surroundings. 

Our kettle did not work (at least there is tea making unlike other 5 star hotels) but immediately upon ringing housekeeping it was replaced. 

Dinner was fabulous in the lovely sika restaurant. 
 As it was my friends birthday they even brought her out a lovely eclair decorated with happy birthday in chocolate and a candle.  Nice touch. 

The windows do however let in a draught particularly as the curtains don't close fully.

The spa is only adequate not as good as other 5 star hotels spas by any extent particularly for its charge! 

Breakfast was lovely with the usual choices of fruits, pastries etc. I asked if I could have fresh pancakes and they brought these out within 10 minutes fresh with fruit and maple syrup. Delicious.

The only major negative was that  i was awoken at 9am by workmen banging on the adjoining patio floor but literally only 2 feet from our room until we checked out. This was not relaxing. While I accept they must work surely it could wait till we left. I told all this to the receptionist who didn't even apologise.

It is expensive but for a treat i would stay here again providing no workmen!

217,"Gorgeous location, hotel needs some TLC","my oh my, the approach to this hotel is just stunning

its in the most fabulous location with gorgeous views of rolling green fields, trees and mountains.

When we arrived into the car park, we immediately noticed that a lot of the masonary was dirty, a lot from a damp irish winter, but needed a good power wash and paint.  The underground car park should be blocked off to guests as it really is not being kept clean and tidy, and there was no sign of a lift.  So we parked in the surface car park.

The hotel entrance is very impressive, check in was quick and easy and our room - our room was stunning - huge wit walk in wardrobe, large bathroom, suppressing bed and a fabulous view over the sugar loaf mountain and hotel garden.  The shower was fabulous, and the bathroom products gorgeous.  Some of the technology in the rooms is beginning to look a little dated, and we completely failed to find the underfloor heating controls for the bathroom - but that didn't matter.

We went for a walk in the hotel grounds and its not as big as I had expected - I now know we should have walked around to Powerscourt house and gardens - retrospect is a great thing.  Again, the grounds need some TLC - some areas need a good powerhose, cigarette butts need to be collected religiosity, areas could do with painting and some of the bedrooms on the ground floor were unoccupied and had the curtains open so you could see the unmade beds.  All in all, the grounds are nice, but could do with the manager walking around with a critical eye - easy stuff to fix.

When we got back, the hotel had delivered 3 lovely scones and a note to our room to congratualte us on our 10th wedding anniversary - they were delicious!

Then we went to the spa - its gorgeous, very relaxing.  The pool is nice and large, the jacuzzi lovely and hot; steam room was broken.  I think again a bit of maintenance in this area would not go astray - paint pealing off the roof in the pool, tiles needing a clean around the jacuzzi.

We tried to go to the sally gap for cocktails, but it was closed so went to the bar (i forget its name) its nice and welcoming.  For dinner we went to Jonnie Foxes (its 20euro each way in a cab, and the live music was good, but the food - I think i would try enniskerry next time - the italian there gets good reviews).

Breakfast was good, in the Sika restaurant - great service, good food selection; the coffee could be better,

All in all we had a lovely break in this hotel; i think it could be a great hotel - its the little things that are letting them down.  Would I recommend it, yes.",4,2015,02,04
217,Loved it...all of it!,"Visited here for the first time on Saturday and I have not stopped talking about it since. I wasn't sure what to expect,had heard it was lovely but it exceeded my expectations. Staff were extremely friendly on arrival,room was fabulous, everything was immaculate and the bed was possibly the most comfortable bed Ive ever slept in. Hotel is elegant and well maintained. The bar was buzzing and comfortable, the Sugar Loaf restaurant was amazing, service was top notch, staff totally understood the menu, the wine and cocktail list, they were attentive but not too intrusive. Food was fantastic, again not too overstated, perfect portion sizes and well presented. We were made feel welcome at every opportunity over our stay. The surrounding grounds really add to the experience. I am just looking forward to planning my next trip back!",5,2015,02,04
217,High fives all round for five star hotel,"We spent 2 nights at the Autograph Powerscourt Hotel & it was a fabulous experience that made us understand just why it is given a 5 star rating.
The customer service was top class & the Hotel is very stylish, elegant, & well maintained.
The rooms are very spacious & incredibly clean. The rooms have an apartment feel to them which gives them a distinct advantage over most other Hotels we have stayed in.
The scenery surrounding the hotel is beautiful with views of the Sugar Loaf Mountain & the Sally Gap, while the private river walk & nearby Powerscourt Gardens are well worth a visit. The nearby village of Enniskerry is picture perfect.
The Spa & Leisure facilities Are very good & relaxing. The only disappointment is that you have to pay extra to access the upstairs part of the spa which I believe should be free of charge
The Powerscourt Hotel is a wonderful place to stay. Full marks to management & the staff, & no doubt the irrepressible Joseph will remember which bottle of red we prefer next time we stay.",5,2015,02,03
217,A definite yes,"Just to add to the positive reviews: a lovely hotel. The room décor is classic, and the rooms are very large. We were upgraded to a suite, in fact, so had a large bedroom and a sitting room. Very comfortable bed. The view out the back of the hotel is peaceful. The inner walls are very solid, so you feel quite isolated from adjoining rooms and the hallway: noise is not an issue at all. We had breakfast at the hotel, which was good--but as others have mentioned, expensive, and I didn't find the food particularly special (good quality hotel breakfast fare). So I would definitely skip the breakfast at the hotel and eat instead at the good café at the Powerscourt Gardens--Avoca, with its beautiful view over the gardens--at a much better price. You don't need to be on a high floor for a good view. The rooms on and below the lobby level have lovely views from the back of the hotel. Some of the rooms have walk-out terraces looking over the garden, with French doors. We actually opted not to stay in one of those rooms, because there were smokers on the next terrace.",5,2015,02,03
217,An absolute Jewel in the crown of Wicklow.,"Without doubt thee nicest and most wonderful hotel I have ever stayed in, in Ireland and I think anywhere in the world that I have stayed. 
From the view of the Sugar Loaf from the balcony window to the warmness and friendliness of the staff. The exquisite (and that is not a word I use often) Sika restaurant and the relaxing ESpa this was truly an experience that I will always remember. Wonderful, wonderful hotel.",5,2015,02,03
217,Keeps getting better!,"I stayed here for one night with my partner & another couple, the whole experience was fantastic. 
We ate lunch in the bar & dinner in the Sugar Loaf lounge & breakfast in Sika, food was outstanding, esp dessert!! Staff throughout all area of the hotel made our stay welcoming & only to happy to help, especially Roisin, Laoise & Orlaith. There was lovely atmosphere in the bar & the spa/pool area! Highly recommend a walk around the grounds.
Have stayed here a few times now & each time it gets better, highly recommended!",5,2015,02,02
217,"""I could marry this chocolate cake"" commented my five year old daughter.","I have stayed in this hotel in its previous incarnation as the Ritz Carlton and I was interested to see how The Marriott are running things. The moment we arrived I realized that things are as good as before. The staff are excellent.They are helpful, friendly and nothing was a problem for them, any requests we had for housekeeping, room service and front of house were dealt with promptly and efficiently.
We stayed in a suite which was everything you would expect from rooms originally designed under the banner of the Ritz Carlton group. Large lounge with tv, sofa all that was needed to totally relax, bedroom again huge comfortable bed, proper bed brought in for our five year old not a shabby hard excuse of a bed which she has been subjected to in other hotels. Bathroom again huge with underfloor heating, plenty of towels, robes, double sinks, large bath and shower, oh and the tv in the mirror gave junior much amusement. The little problem in the room was it was freezing outside and the windows were very drafty which left the heating struggling to heat the room and thus there was a constant background din from the heating.
We ordered room service, and I have to say it was one of the best seafood chowders I have ever had, a large bowl arrived brimming with wonderfully cooked seafood and a jug full of soup to pour over it, delicious. We had an afternoon swim in the spa, kids allowed from 3pm to 6pm in the afternoon and 9am to 12pm in the morning which we also availed of. The pool area is pretty cool check out the website for pics. The spa offers loads of treatments which we shall have upon our return minus junior. For dinner we ate in the Sugar loaf lounge as the Sika restaurant was booked out, McGills bar also serves food which you don't need to book.Starters  were fine no complaints but the mains were a little disappointing , while my salmon was cooked perfectly the whole dish totally lacked seasoning, and my wifes steak was cooked fine but lacked sauce and seasoning, maybe they ran out of salt and pepper. To the positive, junior devoured her pasta as just behind her was a trolley full of amazing individual desserts, there was a selection of five desserts which you could choose if you wanted one two or three. Junior was attacking her chocolate cake when half way through she sat back and declared "" I could marry this chocolate cake"" she summed up the desserts they were excellent. Breakfast the next morning in the Sika restaurant was very good, everything you could ask for was available and I must commend the waiting staff for the manner in which they served an extremely busy room. I have to say I really enjoyed the stay and was sorry it was only for the one night I'm already looking forward to the next visit. At the outset I said we stayed here when it was the Ritz and I am happy to say that overall this visit was excellent, there was a better buzz around the hotel and everywhere was busy both restaurants and the bar which bodes well for the hotel. If in Wicklow for a vacation or if you are looking for an escape for a night or two I would highly recommend Powerscourt Hotel, its not cheap but they do offer some really good package deals.",5,2015,02,02
217,Just fab,"Myself and my wife just stayed here for 2 nights recently. This is a faultless hotel. 5 stars + in my opinion. The grounds, reception, room, dining room bars, literally everything is just fantastic. The hotel provides tranport into Enniskerry which is very handy. Its a quaint little village and worth a look around. We really enjoyed the meals here, breakfast was very good but the evening meal that we had in the Sika restaurant was just fab, fairly expensive, but worth it. The presenation and efficiency was superb. To try and pick a negative comment is difficult. The bar near reception seems to be a little expensive. A standard glass of white wine was 11 euro while it was only around 6 euro in McGills bar based on the 3rd Floor. But if you can afford to stay here, a few euro extra should not be a major problem.",5,2015,02,02
217,Top of the pile. ,"I've stayed in most 5 stars in Ireland but this one stands out a mile.  
Located in a secluded grounds it offers fantastic walks and you have a complimentary bicycle if you like. Crucially for me it's pet friendly and the rooms are to the highest standard.  Watch out for your tv built in to the bathroom mirror. Great cocktails in a very pleasant surrounding.  Great contemporary Irish bar in the hotel also.  

Highly recommend it and will be visiting again soon. ",5,2015,02,01
217,A world class 5 star experience!!,My husband and I stayed for one night at the end of January 2015. We have been in hotels around the world but the Powerscourt is one of the best we have stayed in.  Its the little touches like proper wooden hangers that lift off the rail so you don't have to fight with hanger!  Its the luxury of a tv in the mirror in the bathroom so you can have a bath and watch whatever your heart desires (Eggheads for me!).  Its the complimentary car service into the village so you can have a drink and be guaranteed a lift back. Its the consistency of excellent customer service from all of the staff.  Yes this is expensive for one night but it is well worth it and I hope to come back again!,5,2015,02,01
217,5 out of 5,"I am a regular guest at this property, part of the marriott autograph collection.

I am currently staying for 2 nights , having been upgraded from a regular room to a nice suite free of charge due to my marriott platinum status, something that marriott properties in the uk should do more often .
The room and housekeeping is totally faultless, room service prompt on previous occasions when ive used it. 
Breakfast (comp) in the restaurant and also the lobby lounge extremely good, buffet service and individual dishes as well to order, superb.

Bar service in the on site pub is a little hit or miss, last night (albeit at a busy period) , all staff spent at least 10 mins away from the bar area serving diners leaving no one available to serve at the bar, however on previous visits the service in the pub has been superb.

The management really appear to care , late checkout notices, and other small touches make your business appear appreciated which is rare these days.",5,2015,01,31
217,Terrific,"My husband won a raffle prize of 1 night b&b in this stunning hotel so we used it last week to celebrate my birthday. The welcome on our arrival was wonderful and we were thrilled to be shown to a magnificent suite on the 3rd floor. The staff were so helpful and friendly and when they heard it was my birthday came out with a plate of delicious chocolates wishing me a happy birthday after dinner. The Gin & tonic was served in a ballon glass with cucumber and was so refreshing.
Breakfast the next morning was a wonderful buffet with a super selection of fresh fruit, and delicious home made pastries. Only live a few miles away but will definitely stay there again",5,2015,01,30
217,Wonderful,"Just returned after 3 night stay with baby and husband - the best holiday we have ever had. Stay was wonderful, room was beautiful and the whole experience was extremely relaxing. Spa facilities were also fantastic - can't wait to go back. Large room was very big and there was ample room for travel cot & lots of other baby stuff.",5,2015,01,29
217,Bad experience of Afternoon Tea,"I booked a table for afternoon tea for my birthday but I was very disappointed with the quality and service. When spending so much for afternoon tea I expected the very best. The water that came out for the tea was only just hot, not boiling so our tea went very cold quickly. I don't like egg sandwiches so I asked for an extra one of the others instead of an egg sandwich. The waitress said they couldn't do that because they were already made up. I thought this was very poor form as it shouldn't be a big deal. I asked for raspberry jam instead of strawberry for my scones, and the waitress forgot and had to ask twice. I wouldn't go back for afternoon tea again.",2,2015,01,29
217,Wonderful hotel,"This was our fourth stay at this wonderful hotel.We had a beautiful suite on the third floor overlooking the garden and the fountain.The room was huge and even had a kitchen area with a fridge.Our suite had a covered balcony also.The receptionist on check in and check out was very friendly and helpful.We had room service which was perfect,lovely food served to us by a very nice waiter from Croatia.The swimming pool was lovely and warm but was very noisy as the hotel was busy and seemed to have a lot of children staying,although I think children are only allowed in the pool until a certain time so it was our own mistake time wise.The sauna was very nice also.As we have stayed here before we have seen the beautiful gardens and the waterfall which are amazing,and we have tried the restaurant and mc gills pub which are lovely but we find room service more relaxing.Overall I would highly recommend this hotel and look forward to my next visit.",5,2015,01,26
217,Night away,"What a great hotel, service excellent and food was great. The room was a suite and opulent, relaxing and did not want to leave. The free bikes were a great idea to see the grounds and the river walk. We would not have seen as much without them. We even managed to cycle into Enniskerry for a couple of drinks as well. Breakfast was everything you would want. We will be back the trick is do we bring the kids or not m",5,2015,01,25
217,Lovely Hotel in a great setting!,"Myself and 3 friends recently stayed here and had a great time. We were given 2 twin suites between the 4 of us, they had a large bathroom, walk-in wardrobe, separate living area with sofa, armchair TV etc and a large bedroom with 2 small double beds/large single beds! The room was very comfortable and it was a shame we were only there for 1 night!!! Lobby area was lovely, pool / spa area was amazing, loved the jacuzzi and steamroom, could have stayed there all day! Breakfast had a great selection and was really nice. Would definitely stay here again!",5,2015,01,19
217,overall stay,"Myself and my friend stayed last weekend, hotel fabulous,spa was heavenly, must say all the staff were excellent, helpful and friendly. We had dinner in the restaurant, again food and service was top class.  Will definately stay again.",5,2015,01,18
217,High class luxury,We thoroughly enjoyed a romantic weekend break here. The service and attention to detail was top class. The bedroom are all suite standard with luxurious interior furnishings and decor. The marble bathroom was the best we have ever experienced - sublime. Lunch in the bar overlooking the gardens was excellent. The food and service in Sika restaurant was impeccable. The spa has a lovely ambience with low lighting and  a Haaman suite. Highly recommended.,5,2015,01,18
217,As good as it gets,"Stayed here for 3 nights over Christmas holidays. Top class from start to finish, service, ambience, location and staff could not be faulted. Enjoyed food in McGills & Sugar Loaf Lounge both excellent and staff went beyond the norm to facilitate our request, one of the main dishes was not to our liking but floor manager insisted on enquiring about our dislike and sent over complimentary drinks to make up - nice touch. My only gripes was our bed which had a sunken mattress - informed house keeping twice to no avail, and the children's play area looks neglected and tired.  Excellent hotel and worthy of the exceptional reviews. Will definitely be back. ",4,2015,01,18
217,Excellent stay,"Stayed in one of the suites onto 6 th floor. Excellant view , fantastic room with all the amenities needed . Breakfast delivered next morning in room and was gorgeous. Dinner in sika restaurant , while good , was not as good as expected , cod was average and my fiancees beef was more carvery like.. spa and pool also were fantastic , mcgills pub in-house sounds more like my type of food for my next stay ",5,2015,01,17
217,Fantastic Experience ,"We stayed in this beautiful hotel for 1 night in early Jan 2015. All staff we encountered during our stay were so warm, friendly & polite. From the very beginning of our stay we were made feel so welcome & at home. Our room was just fabulous, so comfortable & luxurious with a beautiful view of the Wicklow mountains from our window. 

We had a fabulous experience in the spa again all staff encountered were just so friendly & helpful, we both received really good full body massages, the therapist I had Aoife was exceptionally good at her job. We really enjoyed the spa experience and would highly recommend booking a treatment as if really enhanced our stay here. We were so relaxed coming up from the spa.  

I enjoyed a relaxing hour in the lovely bath in our bathroom while watching the soaps on the tv in the bathroom, a really nice feature which we have not seen in any other 5star hotel. 

We had a beautiful 3 course meal in the seka restaurant, which I would have to highly recommend, each course was bursting with flavour and we really enjoyed every taste. Again here our waiter was exceptional at his job, very attentive and helpful. 

We also really enjoyed the breakfast here.

If you are looking to de-stress, relax & unwind then powerscourt is the place for you! We hope to return again soon! 

I also have to mention Sharon in reservations who looked after us during booking and was very helpful & informative! 
",5,2015,01,16
217,I expected a little more from this one,"I would have selected 3.5 rating for this hotel if I had the option....
I stayed here with my boyfriend recently for a romantic getaway night.
We were greeted by very pleasant staff at reception. It was very busy but they moved through the queue quickly. Some guests were offered a glass of water while they waited but we were not.
We booked a standard room. The room was huge and had a very large dressing room just off the hall. The bathroom was beautiful and the tv in the mirror a treat. I was disappointed to see no complimentary bottled water which I thought was standard these days?
We decided on a casual dinner option and went to McGills bar. I had a hot whiskey as I wasn’t feeling 100%. At €9 a pop, that was the first and last I had there.
We ordered starters, mains and 1 desert between us. This is the only area I can say our stay was let down. Very very average bar food at not so average prices. Despite that, I found the staff to be very friendly and attentive.
The next morning we were pleasantly surprised to find a note from reception under the door to say check out times had been extended by an hour. Very nice touch!
I wasn’t looking forward to breakfast after a poor meal the previous evening but thankfully my fears weren’t realised. The breakfast was very fresh and tasty. There was a great selection to choose from and I loved the pancake making machine.
We made use of the spa facilities early in the day. Again the staff here were so friendly. The pool area lovely and very well maintained by staff. 
We headed out to look around the grounds before we checked out and a nice guy at reception gave us a map and recommended a walk close by.
Overall we enjoyed our stay as the many pros of the hotel outweighed the poor bar food. Would I stay again……more than likely but I would chose to eat at Sika or the Sugar Loaf lounge instead.",3,2015,01,13
217,Great Stay at Powerscourt,"Lovely surroundings 
Very spacious rooms - get a mountain view room worth the extra as resort view doesn't have much of a view
Great breakfast - very nice
Spa was nice, modern
Our room was very nice, touch screen panels to control curtains, aircon tv etc
Had a great stay, great place to chill.
Even has a pub in the lower floor.",4,2015,01,12
217,Family meal ,"Had a family meal in the bar in this hotel which was nice but unfortunately they are still Charging ritz prices :( please note , you are now a very average 4 star (maybe) hotel with quiet outrageous prices for bar food, as stated food nice, service nice, ambiance nice, prices OTT! €9.50 for Irish coffee 😳 most expensive in Dublin even though they are Wicklow!! €9.00 for dessert again 😳 unbelievable as it was tiny, what is the problem that these hotels do not realise that we will not return or indeed recommend these rip off joints, Powerscourt you need a major wake up call, sort it out, you are no longer the ritz so if you would like repeat business sort yourself the hell out!!!",3,2015,01,11
217,Great Afternoon Tea,"I've been here twice now. Once with friends and once with family - both for Afternoon Tea. 

I've recommend it to anyone wants a day out. The setting is lovely, and if you pick the right route, the drive is lovely too. 

Service was very good. Afternoon tea was lovely - the savoury section was especially delightful. We asked for more scones, teas and coffees and the staff were more than happy to bring them - and there was no extra charge on our bill.",4,2015,01,09
217,Disappointing,"We love to visit spa hotels throughout the year and we were so looking forward to visiting the Powerscourt, especially after reading reviews but were truly let down.

Although the hotel is undoubtedly beautiful, as were the rooms and food delicious, the level of service you expect from a 5 star hotel, was appalling! Let me list my complaints....
* tv not working in bathroom (yes there is a tv in the mirror of the bathroom)
* Sound on tv in living area was atrocious (must have been the same with the  
  room next door as they had their sound up very loud)
* When we booked a movie the movie blanked out at the most critical  
  moment and then picked up at a different scene (very frustrating)
* Very heavy metal door handle of bathroom fell onto my toe!
* No complimentary water on arrival
* No cleaning service provided (yet they charged us for items they said had  
  been used from mini bar which was incorrect)
* No complimentary biscuits (unheard of for a 4 star let alone a 5 star)
* We were informed on arrival that breakfast finished at 11am but on arrival to 
   the breakfast room at 10.45am we were informed breakfast actually 
   finished at 10am!
* The pillows are very very soft and therefore uncomfortable

On checkout I told the receptionist that I would like to speak with Management. She proceeded to take payment and then Liz, Front of House Manager, came to see me. I listed my complaints and she politely apologized and asked me if there was was anything she could do, which I thought moot considering I had already paid and was about to leave. I said that I was very disappointed and I thought she should address these issues. She then handed me her card and said that if I ever decided to stay again to call her and she would look after me. I will not be back.

First impressions really do count and when I compare this to the Merchant Hotel  in Belfast which is also 5 star, there is no comparison. Any issues were promptly dealt with and compensated for your inconvenience. They would never have allowed a customer to leave unhappy.",2,2015,01,08
217,Heaven,I stayed here recently with some girlfriends and I can honestly say it's been one of our best trips so far! We were looked after so well from the minute we arrived and our rooms were out of this world!! The views alone were like something from a movie! The hotel is luxurious while still very welcoming & friendly. The food in McGills Bar was also excellent & I would highly recommend it. I'll most definitely be back again soon.,5,2015,01,08
217,A luxurious getaway on our doorstep.,"Our third year in a row here for a mini-break. Package deals no longer available as before. It's a beautiful estate with many activities and sights available on site. The rooms are spacious and house keeping responded to room needs promptly.
  The pool and spa are second to none. Breakfast was as comprehensive as possible with freshly prepared dishes, eg eggs Benedict, omelettes, etc no problem.
Look forward to next year.",5,2015,01,07
217,Enjoyed every second,"My husband and I spent a two night ""minimoon"" in Powerscourt Hotel. We can't recommend Powerscourt enough. We enjoyed every second of our stay. The rooms are amazing with a TV in the bathroom and electric curtains! The decor is beautiful throughout the hotel. Breakfast was amazing with endless choices. The Espa is like dream. The pool is stunning and the treatments we had outstanding. We truely loved everything from start to finish of our stay. We hope to return every time we are home in Ireland. ",5,2015,01,07
217,Excellent stay!,"I stayed last week with my boyfriend for a lovely two night break. From the moment we arrived we were brilliantly looked after. Despite the recent busy holiday period the staff all seemed fresh and eager to please. 

Checkin was quick and managed well by the staff. Our room was absolutely gorgeous and maintained to the highest standard, I've never before had a TV in the bathroom! Our whole stay was an absolute pleasure. Unfortunately I didn't get many names but a big thank you to Paul on reception for being so kind, Laoise in the restaurant for being attentive and polite and Daire in room service for delivering our food late at night with a smile.

We had an amazing stay and will be sure to come back soon! ",5,2015,01,06
217,Fantastic Stay,"Recently enjoyed a girlie night away and what a treat to stay at the Powerscourt Hotel, the hotel decor is just beautiful, the rooms are pure luxury.The staff were so helpful and polite throughout the day, lots of fun had in McGills Bar, I wish our stay could have been longer!",5,2015,01,06
217,The Spa is to die for,"This is our second visit to the Powerscourt hotel to visit the Spa especially.  We chose the luxury retreat package which included two 1 hour treatments, lunch and use of the thermal suite.  Its amazing and a great way to destress and invest in yourself.  It was also my partners birthday and the presented him with a tray of chocolates for the occasion.  

The staff are pleasant and professional but not too formal, so its easy to feel relaxed.  We'll definitely be back. 

Michael",5,2015,01,06
217,An amazing treat!,"We decided to splash out on 2 nights in Powerscourt Hotel after the New Year as a treat and what a treat it was! We were treated so well by every member of staff from the moment we arrived. 
We had a delicious meal in the Sugar Loaf restaurant on our first night with a spectacular view of the sugar loaf mountain out the window. The service was excellent and the food was delicious (especially the beautiful dessert trolley!!).
I had a massage in the spa the next day and I have to say the whole experience of the spa was incredible. I had initially thought before I went that the treatments were quite pricey but I soon realised that it was so worth it! From the service of the friendly staff to the pool, thermal suites, views and the massage itself, it was complete luxury and we spent most of the day chilling out and relaxing there. It was bliss! 
We then had dinner in the Sika fine dining restaurant on our 2nd night and again it did not disappoint! The service was really fantastic. We were served by a waiter named Joel and he was superb. So friendly, professional and attentive. And the food was divine! Some of the dishes were like works of art and bursting with beautiful flavours! Overall, the atmosphere, ambience, service and food in the restaurant were all top class.
I have to say our whole experience from the moment we arrived to the moment we left was absolutely superb. I couldn't fault a thing. We were splashing out and we took a while to pick a hotel when booking as we wanted a real treat. We were so glad we went with Powersourt. It was so luxurious and was so worth it. Every member of staff we came across was so welcoming, friendly and attentive.  I would highly recommend Powerscourt to anyone, especially anyone looking for a luxurious and relaxing break away with beautiful surroundings and fantastic top class food.",5,2015,01,05
217,Seamless luxury and service,"Our extended family spent Christmas 2014 in Powerscourt - 8 adults and seven children - aged 3 to 78 - and a dog!  From checkin to checkout we were all made to feel at home by the well trained staff.
The rooms and faclities are excellent. Food and dining service were perfectly attuned to the Christmas atmosphere.The setting in the Wickiw hill dstrict is beautiful.
At any time of the year this is a hotel which truly merits its 5 star rating.",5,2015,01,05
217,Outstanding Spa Experience,"I found (in so many senses of the word) myself again in Espa at The Powerscourt Hotel the week running up to Christmas.  I have had the absolute pleasure of being treated to treatments in this spa before (work related ☺) and all I can say is that with each visit my experience seems to get better than the last!  Given the vast array of facilities that this spa boasts I tend to ensure that I give myself plenty of time to indulge.  The minute I walk through those glass doors to the spa I know that for at least a few hours my body and soul are in good hands!

Each time I visit this spa I am always pleasantly surprised by the extra touches that are added to enhance the experience.  They now serve a yummy refreshing sorbet after your treatment! And on the subject of food I just would like to mention that the spa lunch is divine!  I am wheat intolerant which was not a problem, the gluten free bread was delicious! 

So back to my reasons for writing this review – As I have mentioned I have been to this spa before.  Every therapist has been exceptional however this time I particularly asked for a male therapist as my back really needed some muscle power kneading!  I have decided that THE best therapist I have ever experienced works here!  He did a brief but thorough consultation with me and took my recent medical complications into consideration when suggesting the best massage type for my needs.  I decided to totally trust his suggestions and Wow was I surprised!  He seemed to have some sort of physic sense of where exactly my troublesome areas were.  His massage techniques were exceptional.  I mean I don’t know if I have ever felt as relaxed as every knot melted away!  

When I got home my family thought that I had a facial at the spa due to the fact that I was ‘glowing’!  Cannot recommend this spa more!  It’s no wonder that they keep winning ‘Best Spa’ awards!

Ps. Want to know the name of my therapist??  His name is Dan ☺",5,2015,01,05
217,Luxurious accommodation nestled in a stunning landscape,The bedrooms are simply divine. The opulent decor and tasteful style all add to the Powerscourt experience. It was such a special treat to stay in this beautiful hotel and to be waited on polite and attentive staff. The lobby area looked warm and inviting with the very impressive Christmas tree and cute ginger bread village complete with working train! ,5,2015,01,05
217,Absolute luxury,Myself and my friends recently spent a wonderful night hidden away in the luxury of this beautiful hotel. We were made to feel very welcome from the moment we arrived and whilst there we had so much fun. The hotel itself is in the most tranquil and beautiful surroundings guaranteed to relax even the most stressed clientele. Our stay exceeded our expectations at every turn. Would highly recommend.,5,2015,01,05
217,Elegant Luxury,"Set in the tranquil grounds of the Powerscourt estate, this hotel is an ideal retreat to get away from it all, to have some time for walks in the beautiful surroundings or simply to unwind and if interested to avail of the treatments available in the spa. 
We recently visited for a weekend break in early December and thoroughly enjoyed every moment. The building itself is quite striking in appearance and the curved wings extend to embrace the surroundings. Bedrooms were beautiful and spacious with very comfortable beds and magnificent bathroom. Breakfast was a sumptuous feast with a vast array to choose from. We dined here on one evening and again everything was delicious.
The staff were attentive and very friendly to guests which added greatly to the whole experience. Several members of our group availed of treatments and everyone was well pleased with their pampering treats.  
Less than an hour from Dublin this hotel is ideal for an escape. I can't wait for my next visit.",5,2015,01,03
217,"Quite simply Fabulous, Genuine 5 Star","My wife and I have just stayed (last night 2/01/15) for one night. From start to finish alma our expectations were exceeded. Check in was effortless, the Car Park, lobby/reception are all on the 4th Floor!! the Bar (McGill Bar) is down one on the 3rd and the Leisure Centre/Gym is on the 1st floor. Our room (no:447 a suite) was on the 4th floor. All of the common areas are pristine, the toilets are immaculate
Our room was absolutely the nicest room we have ever stayed in, it is immaculate throughout.There is a full sized walk in wardrobe, beautiful lounge area with large TV, the bedroom is also quite spacious and the bed itself is really comfortable. The bathroom is huge as well and inside it has a separate shower room a separate bathroom  as well as his n hers sinks and a neat TV in the mirror.
The Leisure centre, is spotless well staffed and well organised and most importantly the pool is nice and warm.
The staff throughout the hotel were very pleasant, smiling and willing to talk and help.
All in all the I would have to give our stay a 9.9/10, my only gripe would be the price of drinks in the bar, €5.60 for a pint of lager and an astonishing €13 for a cocktail!!!!!!! that really is a bit of a liberty in my humble opinion, and kind of put a bit of a sour taste on it (pardon the pun)
Would i go back/recommend it?? ABSOLUTELY!!!!!!",5,2015,01,03
217,Genuine quality- fabulous food,"Stayed here after a trek in Wicklow so really enjoyed the pampering. Room very spacious and comfortable. Bathroom gorgeous - although would recommend they include bubble bath with the toiletries. Dinner in the Sika Restaurant was to die for - in season venison - explosion of taste in every course.  The pub in the hotel is ok - a pity too much of a smell of vinegar. 
The scenery in Wicklow is fabulous and when the weather closes in - as it does in Jan, the hotel is perfect for lounging around.",5,2015,01,03
217,Elegant - Not Much to do,"We visited for 1 week as part of a convention.  The hotel, the grounds, and the staff were exceptional ! The downstairs Irish Pub was fantastic ! There is not a lot to do here at the hotel, so you'll have to leave the property to find things to do ! Affordable and classy !",4,2015,01,01
217,Worth every penny and more... Bliss!! Best hotel stay! ,"We stayed on the 28th and 29th of December. Beautiful room and bathroom , palatial comes to mind! Actually words can't do the room any justice you have stay in it to appreciate it!  We were warmly welcomed by the staff and shown to our room with a little guided tour and advice from the door man about the amenities and how to make the most of the room facilities. We spent the first night in mcgills pub with it's lovley atmosphere and great entertainment in the
Form of two very talented musicians. We had room service the first night and the food was prompt and delicious. Breakfast was delicious with so much choice. Breakfast was a really luscious experience, we had a seat by the window looking out at the gardens sun beating down on our backs. We walked around the resort which was beautiful, we walked around powerscourt gardens which were stunning and there is an avoca cafe for a little break. The gardens are a must see!!  We ate in the sugar loaf lounge on the second night there was a great choice of food and drink on the menu. We were served exquisite food and the staff were so friendly and helpful. After dinner we moved to the foyer to take in the atmosphere. The pool was a little busy with young families but you are informed of this when u check in and there are selected times for children to use the pool, so it can be avoided. We got two beds together at the poolside and just chilled out. Totally relaxing. This is now our new go to hotel we absolutely loved every second! Great for the post Christmas blues but I would imagine every season brings it's own excitement!!",5,2015,01,01
217,Unacceptable,"Stayed here with my husband on 31 December as we were attending a wedding in Powerscourt House nearby. 

We attempted to check in at 4.30 pm with other guests from the wedding, so there was a rush in the desk, and I appreciate that they also had a different wedding on site and were also dealing with an influx of New Year's Eve revellors. Nevertheless, the performance of the reception staff was woefully inadequate. Guests were left milling about in front of the open door to the hotel in cold and drafty conditions as harassed and unhelpful staff took ages to check each guest in, snapped at other guests already checked in who we're looking for information (including one young guest who was treated quite rudely by the female member of staff on reception) and then proceeded to tell guests that their rooms were not yet available, and they would phone them when the room was freed up. After 30 minutes queuing my husband and I were also greeted by this news. I very rarely get cross in these situations but I completely snapped at the cavalier manner in which this was recounted to us, demanded to know how this could be the situation, demanded to know when a room would be free, all to be told that it was not possible to say and this was an unusual instance where the hotel was unable to live up to its five star reputation. I insisted this was not good enough and was then advised that the room could be available in five minutes - which it was. No proper apology, no offer of tea or coffee while we waited, no understanding that in a situation where we were forced to queue in very uncomfortable circumstances for check-in, that staff should have taken the initiative to talk to guests in advance to explain their predicament. Obviously the place was grossly understaffed to deal with the numbers booked in but that's too bad. They are responsible for properly resourcing the services they are quite happy to charge five star rates for. In addition, they were unable to provide transport to bring guests to and from the hotel to the wedding venue, leaving guests facing the prospect of a ten minute walk in pitch dark and left on their own to figure out the route. Apparently they normally provide that facility but couldn't on this occasion. 

Powerscourt House itself was stunning and the evening a huge success, but marred by the need to negotiate the trip back to the hotel in the dark. 

Overall the room was good but over fussy with its computerized lighting system but the stay was completely soured by the mess over checkin and the very poor front of house staff. If you aren't up to the mark, best not to mention your five star status. By the way, having just returned from the George V is Paris, staff in a genuine five star are effortlessly courteous and attendant to their guests needs, and certainly lacking in the indiscipline and unmerited arrogance I saw on display in Powerscourt Hotel. 

A very disappointing experience. ",3,2015,01,01
217,Very disappointing,"I visited the Spa today with my girlfriends . I was really looking forward to a day of indulgence. My therapist was excellent as was the light lunch.
I travelled early to avail of the spa facilities as I had worked over the entire Christmas period. Firstly the Serenity room was far from serene. It is adjacent to a plunge pool which was full and very noisey. Dirty Delph and cutlery lay alongside the relaxing beds & occasional tables for a considerable time. I visited the room at circa 13.00hrs & 17.00hrs & found it in a similar condition. 
I snoozed around 17. 30 hrs & was awoken by removal of the large refuse bag from storage. The Spa offers noisey Spa flip flops which clatter on the wooden floor. Overall a hell of an experience.
There is no lightening in the pool & excess poolside water was not cleared, extremely dangerous. The ladies steam room was not working. I pressed a button in the steam room on four occasions, which I thought was a reset button. I later learnt it was the emergency button, well it doesn't work as I had to fetch an attendant to query the steam room not functioning.
I did speak to the manager on my departure. She was very welcoming of my comments & did suggest the spa was very busy. However if a Spa accepts large groups we should all be accommodated.
 I was also given a complimentary voucher for use of the Spa facilities.

We went upstairs for a coffee after our treatments. It was exceptionally difficult to find a waiter. I travelled to the bar myself and ordered. When the coffees were served they were cold but were replenished by a manager.
The entrance hall is beautifully decorated as I expected. It was similar to a childrens' playground or Leopardstown racecourse comes to mind. The children had a great evening running up and down whilst their parents chatted. Coffee @ €5 a cup is wasted here, we could not hear ourselves talk. A manager did advise the children were allowed to tire themselves out so their parents could then eat quietly!!!! Time & place comes to mind.

Avoid at all costs at the festive season",3,2014,12,29
217,Great. Couldn't expect more ..... or could we at Christmas,"We decided not to have Christmas at home this year, but work meant we had to stay in Ireland. We thought, let's go all out and go 5*. Powerscourt delivered the 5* experience. Service was amazing from reception to room service to dining. The trouble was it lacked a Christmas atmosphere during the day. Saying that we didn't have small children, so that may have something to do with it. 
The McGills pub was the best for atmosphere especially Christmas night, with good music and a great bar manager - Ian. 
The Spa was excellent and the pool good. Liked the idea of children having set times as well, so you could have some quiet time. We all had a treatment, but the male facial was poor and as it was his first time, it would have been nice if someone explained what he was having done. My facial was amazing and the guy really knew what he was doing and explained where my 'weak' areas were.
All in all a good place to stay and would do it again, just not at Christmas.",4,2014,12,29
217,Dissappointing,"We stayed here recently and we were very underwhelmed by the overall experience. The hotel is too big, too impersonal and it lacks warmth. The decor is stuffy and the furnishings are not very modern. We stayed in a mountain view suite. The room itself was big and it did have a nice view of the mountain but the furniture was old and the place did not have a fresh feeling to it. The bathroom also was big but again, the marble was stained and not very inviting. We were expecting an air conditioned room, however, the air conditioning was preset to 19 degrees. The was far too hot and stuffy and as someone with sinus problems, this was just unbearable and I did not sleep a wink all might. We ate in the Sika restaurant. The furnishings of the restaurant again are very impersonal, very standard hotel breakfast style decor with bright lighting overhead and no atmosphere. The meal itself however, was good. The choice of starter was poor - either something raw or game or sheep cheese. I choose the sheep cheese and the texture was not very pleasant but the accompanying beets were good. My partner had something in a pastry - i passed on this. My halibut however, was very good -cooked perfectly and my partner also enjoyed his beef. The breakfast buffet next day was standard, nothing special and the eggs and bacon were tasteless although the fresh fruit selection was good. This hotel is probably good for a wedding or a dinner dance night out but for a special occasion, I would not recommend it",3,2014,12,28
217,If only this hotel could be replicated,"As a frequent traveller, this is by far the most comfortable hotel I have stayed in for some time. The rooms are spacious, well equipped and the bed was heavenly. From the live music in the Lounge, to the great atmosphere in the bar and lovely food in the restaurants, not forgetting the relaxing spa, and the surrounding walks - this is my ultimate weekend escape. Already looking forward to my next visit.  Thanks to all the wonderful staff.",5,2014,12,27
217,As good as it can possibly get,"From the moment we drove through the entrance gate to driving out the gate the next day, we felt like we were royalty. We were there for a company Xmas dinner, and we decided to book into the hotel for the night, therefore I cannot comment on the cost.

When we booked in we went to our bedrooms first, and I can honestly say this bedroom was enormous. We then went down for the dinner, and it was simply delicious, with the detail to presentation VERY impressive. I am not a dessert lover, but I can honestly say this was one of the best desserts I have ever had.. 

Later we went to bed, and the bed was king size, and had a mattress on it that wouldn't allow one to wake up. Upon waking up,  was able to open the curtains without getting out of bed - electric button to do the job for me, along with more controls to swithc on the bedside lights, and the tv. This is also the first time I have stayed in a hotel that had Sky sports as standard.

The breakfast was exemplary, and all I can say there just wasn't enough room in my stomach to sample each and every item. Before we left we sauntered around the hotel for a walk, and found the swimming pool - us cursing that we hadn't brought our costumes with us. Also, we were most impressed with the toy train-station made of ginger bread and icing ( for snow). It was amazing. We didn't want to leave, but had to, with a heavy heart.

I take great joy in searching for faults in any restaurant or hotel I go to. The only fault I could find here was concerning the bedside controls in the bedside locker. On waking up we discovered the digital clock on my bedside was reading 1 hour too fast. But I have to say, to use this as a fault is being VERY finniky. I can honestly say this was one of the best hotels we have stayed in in Ireland, or elsewhere throughout the World.

We WILL be back!!!",5,2014,12,26
217,Everything was great except some staff a little distant,"My wife and I stayed here early Dec 2014. It was quiet which sometimes made this very large hotel seem empty and almost eerie due to lack of atmosphere. The rooms are large and the food was excellent while some of the foreign staff in particular lacked any warmth. Some other staff were excellent, very helpful with great advice on the wines and food. The free bikes are great for getting around.",4,2014,12,23
217,Amazing Hotel! The staff made this place even better than 5*****s,"So first off, I have to start by saying that this hotel is Amazing, but ""off the beaten path"". GPS navigation from Dublin Airport to the hotel (abt 35min) lets you off in the middle of the quaint town of Enniskerry (I grew quite fond of the town during my week stay). I think that this is due to the fact that the name Powerscourt is virtually listed on everything locally! :-) The actual hotel is up a little ways further off a road to the right. So if you're looking for a location close to the Dublin area, its a little bit of a drive. There is access to the ""Dart"" in Bray which is only a 10 minute drive, that will take you right into Dublin without the need to drive (it's like a small version of NYC so parking is not easy).

Ok, that being said, THE HOTEL IS BEAUTIFUL!!! The rich wood, cavernous, palatial ceilings and fireplaces in the lobby are a wonderful ""welcome home"" to warm your toes after a long (sometimes chilly & rainy) day of sightseeing (it was November after all). The hotel staff was amazing, especially Robbie Smyth, who made our venturing out for local excursions so much easier with his hand-drawn maps, and recommendations of little places to ""stop and rest"" along the route.

We had a bit of an issue upon check-in, since we were there at 6am and check-in wasn't until 3pm. Really not the fault of the hotel, and they tried everything that they could to find us a little place for some quiet time and a nap after our overnight flight in (they were at capacity or else I'm sure they would have found us a room to ""nap"" in). We also had a bit of a ""glitch"" with the travel agent's reservation and they neglected to mention that we had upgraded to a mountain view suite. While my husband went into the other room for some sleep, the hotel very kindly provided us with the suite that we had asked the travel agent to request for us previously. 

And what a lovely suite it was! I felt like I was in a luxury apartment! A long entrance hallway, leading to an attractive living room with a couch, two upholstered chairs, coffee table, fireplace (non working) and TV. Then a small ""office"" area with a desk and into the stately looking ""dining room"" (with mini bar.. pay of course) and finally through the French doors and into our very large bedroom! The lights in the entire room con be controlled by 3 different in-wall (or nightstand) touch screen panels. So if you forgot to turn off the living area lights, you can easily control those from the bed! Then there's the bathroom which was truly fit for for a king.. I could sleep 10 people comfortably in it.. Huge soaking tub and separate rain shower, plus the toilet separated by another door. Oh, and I almost forgot to mention the ""Guest 1/2 bath"" in the foyer! Both rooms with radiant heated floors, keep your tootsies warm on a chilly Irish November morning. Oh and let's not forget the complimentary wifi. (allowed me to put my phone in airplane mode and still be able to text friends and family back home to share my pictures from each day!). the only ammenity that I was upset to not take advantage of was the indoor pool (don't forget your swimsuit!) & spa! We toured it though, and it looks incredible!

The on-site breakfast accommodations looked amazing! (we didn't partake in buying the added breakfast buffet but saw it and it looked unlike any other I've seen!). Sika, the restaurant in the hotel was INDREDIBLE... the food was 4 star all the way and the service was amazing. They also have a lovely ""lounge"" upstairs right off the lobby which has gigantic windows overlooking sugarloaf mountain. The food is really really good, breads, butter all fresh. (loved the seafood chowder). Service was once again, superb. Lastly, there's a cute pub downstairs called McGills. Great little night spot to watch football (American, believe it or not) and grab a pint of Bulmers or Guinness. We met quite a number of Irish tourists from the other side of the country while they were there for a nice weekend away. The people in Ireland truly made our experience so wonderful that I cannot wait to go back!

A few places local to the hotel that are ""must sees"" are the Powerscourt Falls & Powerscourt House/gardens (voted the 3rd best garden in the WORLD). It probably rained more while we were there then they experienced all summer long, so we got to see the falls in all of it's glory! Not that you want to pray for rain while you're there, but it's much more amazing to see when there's a good volume of water flowing. A little further off (but an amazing drive.. ask Robbie for a map) is Glen da lough.. the drive itself was worth the price of admission. Stop on the way in the little town of Roundwood for a pint (not too much though, the Irish aren't easy on the whole DWI thing). The town of Dalkey (Bono's hometown) was a nice place to spend an afternoon walking around and shopping or stopping in a couple of the many pubs to sit and talk to locals for a bit. Slainte! (prounounced slahn-cha and is a common toast) We ended up bumping into Robbie's neighbor at ""The Club""! 
Don't be afraid to strike up the conversation.. It will be worth it! We met people and became Facebook friends before we left!

We drove pretty much everywhere while we were there, Enniskerry (in the Wicklow mountain region) is a lovely town with a few quaint restaurants and pubs. Stopped at Mac's pub, which was a small local establishment and  met Mach (sounds like Mash). He's quite a funny man and ""made"" me try ""the best Guinness ever"" (which I can say that I agree with now!). Poppies is a lovely little breakfast place which we visited most mornings on our way out and about. The driving there can be a bit of a challenge as the roads are quite narrow and windy. Although if you're used to driving on the left, then I'm sure you'll be fine!

I think I've written enough to give you an idea of how amazing the Powerscourt Hotel is (and Ireland over-all). Do go and visit and don't forget to say ""Hello"" to Robbie. I'm planning my next trip to Ireland and I have to make sure that I get to spend a few days on the west coast next time, but make sure to end the trip with a couple of nights back at what is now my favorite hotel in Ireland, the Powerscourt Hotel.",5,2014,12,22
217,Beautiful hotel,"This is one of the nicest hotels we have ever had the pleasure to stay in. We had a deluxe suite. The bathroom was huge, with a TV built into the mirror, so you can soak in the soaking tub and watch tv while you do so. The separate shower wonderful with rainshower and separate hand shower. Separate toilet stall also. The closet was gigantic. it could be a room in itself. The living room was as large as my living room at home, and the bedroom with the king size super comfortable bed was also very large. The hotel was beautiful and well kept. the pool is attached to the spa, and is very luxurious and relaxing with soothing music, and cushioned chaises. We did not use any of the spa services, so cannot comment. the fitness room is very large with a view of the fountain. It had an array of machines and weights. We ate at the Irish pub and they did a good job of making it feel authentic. The food there was also very good, especially the banoffee pie.",5,2014,12,21
217,Amazing Hotel,"Stayed at this hotel in July 2014 for my wedding anniversary and what can I say. I have been wanting to stay at this hotel for a while and it most certainly didn't disappoint . The staff upgraded our room to a suite which was amazing. This hotel was everything I thought it would be & more. The staff where very professional and welcoming. The restaurant within the hotel was fantastic, we also had breakfast which was something else.",5,2014,12,18
217,Best of Ireland,"Powerscourt Hotel was astonishing. The restaurants were divine and the staff were as good as it gets. This combined with incredible Powerscourt Gardens and Golf Courses makes for a wonderful vacation. It is in the middle of the Wicklow Mountains , full of beautiful scenery and history, and a short drive or taxi ride to Dublin.",5,2014,12,18
217,Wow Factor was all around,"Stayed at this beautiful hotel for two evenings on business.
Check in was quick and so efficient and professional. I had room 345 and it was immaculate and spacious to say the least. Service through out the entire property was astounding.  The beds were very comfortable. The property itself is well maintained and all staff we encountered were very professional and always had a smile on their face and ready to help the guests.
I have already planned another stay at this hotel for February as this is one property that shouldn't be missed when visiting Dublin. Thank you Powerscourt Hotel for a very nice and comfortable stay. We will be back.",5,2014,12,18
217,A handsome hotel that needs retouch.,"It's a handsome hotel that needs a retouch. Some of the dining tables & chair at the Sugar Loaf Loungeare showing wear & tear as the wooden furniture in the bedroom. 

Was traveling with kids & the playroom is a sad, abandoned state. It even smells abandoned. Goes to show it doesn't get used often. 

Dining staff were attentive. Perhaps too attentive that they whisk away your plate while you're still eating. 

Limited dining options. You either do high end Sika or pub grub at McGills. Nothing in between. 

Overall, had a nice stay but the hotel itself could do a bit of a makeover. ",4,2014,12,17
217,"Perfect, on every level!","My wife and I recently stayed at Powerscourt Hotel, and loved it! The room B&B was €180 which for a 5* hotel on a stunning country estate next to Powerscourt Gardens (3rd best in the world!) was exceptional value! Add to this the use of the Spa facilities (Espa!) and you'll be blown away. We were in a room on Floor 5 with a mountain view which was stunning and the room and all it's features was perfect! Everything about the stay was perfect including breakfast and we would certainly recommend this hotel to family and friends.. and you! ;)",5,2014,12,17
217,Girls Night,"All staff were excellent.  I have shared my views with Management regarding wheelchair accessibility, public toilet facilities and the ADA room that I stayed in - all of which were well received and I understand are being considered.  My 3 friends and I dined in the restaurant and the meal was delicious and service excellent.  As the restaurant was very busy for breakfast, we had ours in the lobby which was a great advantage.  The buffet range catered for all needs and was delicious.  After breakfast, we read the newspapers and then had a facial in the spa, which was most enjoyable.  All 4 of us enjoyed our mini break and would return",4,2014,12,13
217,Definitely in the Top 3 hotels I've visited,"Driving through the grounds was very scenic and I was very impressed upon arrival at the hotel. The lobby was huge and was decorated for Christmas (gingerbread house and train were a fun addition!) Staff at reception were very friendly and professional. We checked into our room, which has a lovely view of the grounds. There was a bathroom with a separate toilet and shower room: and a TV mounted onto the mirror if you're into watching movies in the bath!! The beds were massive and there were electronic controllers to adjust lighting, temperature etc. 

I had a package booked in Espa, the hotel spa, which won best spa destination this year. I ate lunch in the spa and had two treatments; back, neck and shoulder massage and facial. They were both fantastic. We then had access to the rest of the facilities. The swarovski infinity pool was amazing and replicated a nights sky. There was a hot tub beside the pool and many beds for lounging. Upstairs there is a serenity room which plays music and provides the most amazing view of the grounds and Sugarloaf mountain. Adjacent to this room, is the heat experience, with heated loungers, sauna, steam room and jacuzzi again with amazing views. Try it for sunset.

We ate in the Sugar loaf lounge that evening. The food was brilliant, but the service was even better! I will definitely return to Powerscourt again, very soon. It is a little expensive, but a perfect treat.
",5,2014,12,13
217,Beautiful Structure and Grounds,"(While I am including negatives in this review, Powerscourt was lovely, and I would stay there again.)  When I heard this was a former Ritz Carlton, I figured this would be a nice place.  The exterior was massive and not particularly striking other than its size.  However, the interior is beautiful and richly decorated with high quality finishes.  When we arrived there was no one at reception; after waiting a minute or two for someone to appear, she was friendly, but we waited for another several minutes for her to search the computer for a room for us (we were not checking in early).  The room we were given happened to be an accessible room with a huge shower to accommodate a wheelchair, etc.  It was a huge and lovely room but odd in a number of ways--there was nowhere to hang a towel; there was one chair that my husband could sit in to watch TV, but I had to sit on the bed to do so.  Perhaps furniture was removed to allow more space for maneuvering a wheelchair?  The lighting was horrible.  Only one side of the bed had a reading lamp with what seemed to be a 40 watt bulb.  Lights in the bathroom and the numerous closets were bright and fine.  There were two TV sets--one was built right into the mirror in the bathroom--very cool.  We did reserve a mountain-view room but did not get one.  We were too tired to go back and change.  Breakfast, which was included in our rate, was fantastic.  It was a buffet that offered numerous options including delicious pastries, fruit, yogurt, cheese, cold cuts along with hot entrees of eggs, ham, etc.  Dinners at all restaurants were very good, and the service was too.  It was cold and rainy while we were there, so we did not take advantage of the lovely grounds, but we did walk around a bit and walked over to the Powerscourt Gardens (extra charge) to spend a couple of hours.  There are 250 species of plants as well as fountains, statues and a manor house that now houses a few stores.  I loved this spot; we walked in the rain and enjoyed every moment of it, including the numerous birds.  After our first encounter checking in, service was great, and I would definitely go back.",4,2014,12,12
217,Ireland Gateway,"It was my first time in Ireland and what an amazing trip. The hotel is surrounding by hills with beautifull landscapes especially views from the lobby restaurant are spectacular. We stay in one of the suite with terrace very nice and spacious. Breakfast next morning was delicious one of best I have ever had deserve 5 star rating with selections of everything you can dream to eat: french pastries, pancakes, granola, sausages, charcuteries, cheeses board, eggs list is long...hotel has a good size swimming pool with swarovski crystals and day changing lighting to impress also a spa and hammam. I have to mention people working there are very friendly, helpful makes your holiday very special. Huge thank you to the best Concierge in Ireland Rob for booking us an unforgettable dinner at Johnnie Foxes Pub with a live music and dancing  performance. In conclusion if you are looking to spend an amazing weekend away book your stay in this hotel which has everything to make your holiday perfect.",5,2014,12,09
217,Beautiful location and 5 star service,"I stayed here in April and went back again to enjoy the experience. The staff at check in are very helpful and were kind enough to give us an upgrade. We had two small kids with us and the staff made every effort to accommodate the kids, not something you find in many hotels in Ireland.
The room was a suite and was magnificent with great views over the garden. We had a separate sitting room which was very handy when the kids went to sleep we were able to relax and watch the television there.

The food in the lobby is quite pricey for what you get. On the second night we ate in the main restaurant and found it to be of a much higher standard with great variety in the menu and top quality food. The breakfast is one of the best I have had in a hotel, try the granola or a pancake from their pancake making machine both were delicious.

The spa area is also very nice and there is a shuttle service into the town if you want to sample the local nightlife. Overall, a great venue with hard working staff I would definitely recommend a stay here.",5,2014,12,09
217,amazing experience,"we booked  2 nights in this hotel with my girlfriend to relax from from our very busy life.

we asked for a superior room and I have to say the bedroom was fantastic and very spacious. It was more like a junior suite with an amazing marble bathroom (there was even a TV in the bathroom mirror !!)
We enjoyed the restaurant very much with an excellent food menu and a very professional service.
The pool is fantastic  and very relaxing, perfect temperature - Same for the Jacuzzi.
The hotel is ideally located in the middle of nature, close to an amazing golf club and one of the best garden of Ireland
A must do !",5,2014,12,09
217,Proper five star luxury,"Stayed here over the weekend. What a perfect hideaway just a short distance from Dublin. Had a deluxe room that was really spacious. It had a separate dressing room, sitting area and a well appointed bathroom. As someone who likes to read I found the lighting very inadeqaute so if management read this it would be great to have reading lamps near the bed as I know other people also found this a disadvantage. Everyplace was spotlessly clean and the staff could not have been more pleasant and helpful. Had dinner in the restaurant and the food was top class. Much better than the fare usually served in hotels though I do think charging €6.50 for a bottle of Ballygowan sparkling water was very excessive. The breakfast was also top notch. I have to pay particular credit to Thaty who served us as she was superb - professional but warm. The spa and pool area was really relaxing and looked out onto beautiful woodland. There are several lovely walks nearby and of course Powerscourt House is just a short distance. You can park the car for the weekend and enjoy the local countryside on foot. Will definitely be back.",5,2014,12,09
217,Fantastic Accomodation,"I stayed in this hotel for one night recently. The hotel itself is beautiful, wonderfully decorated for the Christmas season. 
Our room was one of the most luxurious that I have ever stayed in, really beautiful. 
The only thing that was a little disappointing was that we had to queue for half an hour for breakfast. At first I thought this was because breakfast was cooked and ordered individually per person, but this was not the case, it was a buffet breakfast. The hotel was extremely busy with several christmas parties, so there were not enough tables so this was the reason for the wait.
The wait was worth it however, breakfast was great and the staff on duty for breakfast were very attentive.",4,2014,12,09
217,powerscourt hotel,"This is a truly five star experience, its appearance, the views, the food, the service, right uip there with the very best, cannot wait to go back! And to think its less than half an hour from Dublin!",5,2014,12,07
217,Absolute Disgrace,"I stayed in this hotel for 2 nights just under a week ago after booking the rooms online through hotelscombined. I booked 2 rooms one for my partner and I and another for my parents as a birthday gift. The room rate I received per room for the 2 nights b&b was €160 which I found to be cheap as this was a '5 Star' hotel. I double checked over the booking again and even done a second search which all checked out the same for both rooms so I went ahead and booked the rooms. 

Im generally curious when it comes to online bookings so the next day I called the hotel directly to make sure the booking was confirmed, I spoke with Christina at the front desk who transferred me to reservations and low and behold there was no booking under my own or parents name. I was told to call back in 24 hours as it can take a certain period of time to go through the hotels system when booked through one of their third party vendors. The next day I called back and yet again I was told my booking was not confirmed. I was then put through to reservations where Jacqueline took charge of my query. I gave all the valid information booking number, website used, dates and so on and still nothing. After 18 mins on the call a conclusion was made, I was told that the third party vendor I booked through was trading under the hotels previous name 'Ritz Carlton Hotel Autograph Collection' and that they would honour my booking. I was told everything was arranged and my booking was confirmed to which I thanked Jacqueline. Shortly after the call I sent an email to the hotel through their website thanking Jacqueline and Christina for their help and service to which I never received a reply. 

My parents arrived at the hotel shortly before myself last week and on check-in were told there were no bookings under my name or parents names to which they were completely shocked and embarased. When I arrived at the hotel to check-in I handed the confirmation to the clerk. I was then told again that nothing was showing for myself on file with this booking but that a manager would resolve it. Eventually I spoke with a 'stand in' manager who I had to explain my story to yet again. She confirmed the 2 rooms and asked would I like to pay the"" €160 
Per night per Room straight away"" to which I explained yet again that the confirmation sheet, which was in front of the agent on the counter, confirmed that the room rate was 160 per room for the 2 nights. The agent then proceeded to ask whether or not I would like to purchase breakfast in advance at €28per person. I felt as if I was being utterly ignored with my advances to get the agent to review the confirmation sheet as breakfast was clearly stated in bold black lettering for both rooms on both mornings. I felt completely ignored and belittled and expressed this to the agent whom apologised and assured me she would take care of this situation and direct it to the appropriate hirearchy. I payed for both rooms there and then (€320) and was asked would I like credit on the room to which I declined and advised agent that I would pay for any extras with cash on departure. The agent issued me with receipt for the room and I was relieved that everything was eventually sorted, or so I thought. 

We didn't spend much time in the hotel as I had my young son with me and children were only permitted to use pool at certain hours of the day so we had to find other ways to keep him entertained. The breakfast was the best thing about the hotel and the staff at breakfast were friendly and very helpful, if only they dealt with reservations the hotel would be ran more efficiently.

So came the check out. I checked out before my parents and was dealing with Andrew at the reception desk. I gave in my room keys and Andrew asked me would I be settling the bill for both rooms. I advised Andrew that I had made payment on arrival and presented the receipt to him with proof of payment, he advised me there was a mini bar tab which I told him we would settle with cash once my parents were checking out as they had used the mini bar. After checking my receipt Andrew then told me I had been charged incorectly and there was a refund of €135 due back on my card I asked him why was that the case and he said he wasn't sure, he refunded the money back on my card which I authorised. Roughly a half hour later my mother went to check out of my parents room, she gave her room keys back to Andrew and was due to settle the mini bar fee of roughly 23 euro. Andrew then asked my mother would she be settling the bill for her room to which she advised him I had already paid, to which he cheekily replied ""we do not do rooms for €80 a night here"" which my mother found very disrespectful. I spoke with Andrew again and asked him what was the problem, he advised me that the sysytem only showed him that the payment I made on arrival only showed for my room and not my parents. I was in complete shock at this point that not one person had documented this situation that arose numerous times. I urged Andrew to review the confirmation that I had given the hotel and he then advised me that he had made a mistake when refunding my card with the €135. I couldn't begin to believe how he had made this mistake so I then had to make a payment for the mistake that Andrew had made by refunding my account and I also payed my parents mini bar tab on my card it came to just under €160. Andrew issued me with a receipt and I advised him to make sure he updated the records that I was completely disgusted by everything that had happened. 

I was out of the hotel and on the road just after 12:30. The next day I went to pay my bills online and noticed there was a transaction off 300 euros taken from my account which I had no recollection off. I called my bank and they made me aware that Powerscourt Hotel had withdrawn 300 euros from my account without my permission. I was absolutely livid at this point. I called the hotel on Monday and asked to speak with a general manager, I was passed onto the manager of the RESTAURANT, Conor, who could not make head nor tails of the situation as he had nothing to do with reservations. Conor was probably the only person who escalated my issue out of every single person because I received a phone call on Tuesday by no other than Andrew. He told me yet again he was standing in for the manager and he gave me an excuse for the reason why the unauthorised payment was taken from my account, he claims it was a yet ANOTHER mistake as I was charged for my mother's room because the payment was never set up on the 2 rooms correctly from the check in. I told Andrew I was not accepting that as an excuse and that the customer service and escalation of the problem was utterly disgraceful to which he could only apologise and there was nothing else he could do. I asked Andrew numerous amount of times as to why this happened to which he replied that he did not know he has never seen it happen before and the hotel had made it a serious matter but yet the general manager did not have the decency to call even though this is 'supposively' the first time this has ever happened. 

This hotel might look like a 5 star hotel but they do definetly not provide 5 star customer service. I've still yet to receive the €300 which was taken from my account on Saturday a half hour after I checked out as it usually takes up to 3 working days and still have yet to hear from David Wester even after I was told he was made aware of this never before seen issue. 

If your staying at this hotel check all paper work thoroughly and make sure you hold every single receipt.",1,2014,12,04
217,A wonderful place to start your vacation in Ireland.,"I spend 5 nights in the Powerscourt Hotel, and they were five wonderful nights.  Free underground parking, beautiful rooms, great views, shuttle service into the local town of Enniskerry.  I would want to go back every time I visit Ireland.  The hotel is located on the  eastern edge of the Wicklow Mountains, so it is idea for day trips.  While my wife and I were at the hotel there were two conferences.  The place is large enough that we were not disturbed or inconvenienced by the large group of excited attendees.",5,2014,12,02
217,Could not recommend more highly!,"I stayed here with my partner in the middle of November for our 1st anniversary and from the moment we arrived at reception until the moment we checked out we were absolutely spoiled rotten by the wonderful staff! We stayed in one of the suites on the same floor as the Spa and I have honestly never stayed in a more beautiful room in all my years of travelling. With its own hall, area, lounge/living area which opened into a stunning bedroom and 2 bathrooms (one fitted with a tv within the mirror, the ultimate luxury!) It was perfection. The staff were so accommodating and helpful and really could not have done anymore to make our stay anymore perfect. The room service was by far the best I have ever had (highly recommend the amazing afternoon tea - it will never be beaten!)

On our last day, we visited ESPA for a day of pampering - you could say we saved the best till last. We booked the beautiful couples suite and had an amazing massage with Aisling and Sarah, 2 girls who were not only fabulous at what they do but were so lovely and a credit to the hotel. After spending time in the jacuzzi in the couples suite where we almost fell asleep after our blissful massages, we checked out the beautiful pool and the thermal suites which were lovely and peaceful for a Sunday. I cannot say enough about how beautiful this whole spa area is. To me, it is one of the most relaxing places I have ever been and just what I needed to unwind from work. But what makes it even more special is how caring the staff are, how attentive they are to their customers and how relaxed they make the whole atmosphere. There is something about this amazing hotel that almost feels as if you already know everyone because they are so attentive to detail - it is like a home away from home but in the most luxurious surroundings and I am already excited for my next stay. A weekend was most definitely not long enough! Thanks to all the amazing staff who contributed to the most perfect anniversary :-)",5,2014,12,02
217,Charming stay in County Wicklow,"Our short stay in Wicklow could not have been any more lovely thanks to Annemarie's hospitality. We were provided with very detailed directions and a wonderful cup of tea upon arrival. Our room was perfectly cozy with two beds and our own en-suite bathroom (with a jet tub!!), which we were elated to come home to after the days of driving and sightseeing. Could not recommend this place enough. Thank you Annemarie! ",5,2014,12,02
217,Fantastic location beautiful property,"an old stately home completely refurbished into a grand hotel set in the extensive grounds of the former estate. I was here on a conference early in the year and had a delicious and leisurely lunch on the terrace and actually got sunburned a first for me in Ireland! Lovely walks and running routes throughout the grounds and down into a picture perfect village. Service was very good, straightforward and warm rather than sophisticated but very welcoming. A lovely Irish experience close to Dublin.",5,2014,12,02
217,The perfect escape!,"What is there not to love about Powerscourt Hotel? Short trip from Dublin - Check! Stunning surroundings - Check! Lovely room - Check! Welcoming, courteous staff - Check! Delicious food - Check! The only downside was we couldn't spend more time there. Will definitely be back. Keep up the good work!",5,2014,12,01
217,Absolutely incredible...,"The perfect stay...every single detail.  One of the most beautiful properties I've ever seen.  The service, room, grounds, and restaurants (especially the breakfast buffet) were all incredible.  I cannot say enough about the staff...they worked so hard to anticipate every need.  Thank you so much...I'll be back soon!",5,2014,11,29
217,Grand Budepest Hotel,"If you've seen and loved Wes Anderson's amazing film then you'll understand that the only thing missing at Powerscourt is Ray Feinnes and you may have to come up with your own quirky plot for you stay. My wife and I were lucky enough to be given a voucher as payment for a job and finally got around to taking advantage of it last week. Right from the moment of booking I could tell by the reservation person's friendly manner that we were going to have a nice stay. 

We arrived a little early and were told our room was having maintenance done to it, but would be ready shortly which was fine by us as it gave us time to have some lunch and a cocktail as we sat in their martini bar and overlooked the hotel lawn. The lunch menu was simple, but the food great. I was dying for a burger and it didn't disappoint. 

After lunch out room was ready and we went up to the six floor to find we had been uprgraded to a corner suite with balcony. The room was stunning with it's own lounge/dining room, dressing room, two bathrooms and my personal favourite: a television in the bathroom mirror. Having spoke to a friend that stayed in a normal room the tv in the mirror is apparently standard, but it's impressive and very cool, especially when you come back to your room after dinner and Neil Diamond is singing 'Sweet Caroline' in your bathroom.

The rest of the stay was outstanding. We played outdoor giant chess and indulged in the most opulent breakfast and dinner at their restaurant. The wine prices were a bit over the top as were their alcohol prices in general, but I guess that's what you expect from a five star hotel. Although being from Australia and having the best wines at our beck and call, I thin they could lower the price of some of these. 

The spa was amazing, with a very delicious massive swimming pool at hot spa at everyone's disposal. I wouldn't bother with the 25 euro tariff to hit the heat suite as you can't go with your partner anyway. 

I can't wait to return to this place it was so much fun and any place that has its own inbuilt Irish Bar is a win in my books.",5,2014,11,26
217,Pure Luxury,"We had one night away for our wedding anniversary and decided to treat ourselves to a stay at this five-star hotel and it was worth every penny.  I happened to mention when I was booking that it was our anniversary and when we arrived we had been upgraded, which made the stay even more special.
The room was gorgeous and the bathroom super-spacious with great products and plenty of them.  
And we had some chocolates delivered to our room too, which was just so lovely.
We had dinner at the Sika restaurant, which was delicious and the service was amazing.
It really was a super-luxurious and special stay.
They really know how to take care of people and we loved our short stay.
The bed was honestly one of the most comfortable things I have ever experienced - it was like sleeping on the cloud.  
We'll definitely be back - probably next year for our anniversary!",5,2014,11,26
217,Wonderful Weekend with Friends,"I have stayed at this hotel before but really wanted to leave a review after this occasion. The rooms my friends & I stayed in were spacious and beautiful, and the food and spa were wonderful too.

The hotel experienced an unfortunate hiccup with the water system. A problem that was unforeseeable and beyond their control. I feel that they handled the situation in the very best way that they could, and the lines of communication were always open. Updates were also left via the messaging system on the room's television sets. 

My friend and I were pretty unaffected by this outage, and made the best out of the situation. We had a thoroughly enjoyable stay and are really looking forward to visiting again. Thank you very much to the staff, who more than earned their keep during this event!",5,2014,11,26
217,Beautiful hotel.......with a few glitches,"We recently returned from Ireland where we spent the majority of our visit in the countryside . We chose the Powerscourt Hotel for accomodations.
Overall, it was an exceptional experience. 
The staff was very helpful and friendly. The food, both in the hotel restaurants and room service were consistently good. 
McGill's was our favorite.
We upgraded to a suite. The room was quite comfortable, clean and spacious.
When we arrived, following a red eye flight, the receptionist was understanding and accommodating.  Unfortunately,  the hotel did not have record of our reservation,  even though I had a confirmation number. We were fortunate they were not fully booked. Reception handled the situation quickly. I asked to discuss a few additional issues with the general manager. He was apparently to
 busy and sent the concierge in his place. Bobbye was very charming and helpful. It is not a wonder that he was sent to smooth things over. I am of the opinion that if a guest specifically asks to speak with a GM, he should honor the request.
The hotel is lovely. The surrounding area is breathtaking.

217,world class,"I stayed several times when it was Ritz Carlton,  and was concerned this time that there might be a change in quality.  I found that while prices have moderated,  standards have improved, especially in that the staff have become far friendlier. Also, dinner and breakfast were fantastic. Recommend this as a truly excellent hotel, definitely up there with the very best.",5,2014,11,24
217,"Beautiful Property, handled Issues so-so","First let me start by giving you a profile of the travelers.  2 adults, mid-30's, no kids, well traveled globally.  First time in Dublin and the Powerscourt Hotel. 

I selected Powerscourt as an opportunity to get out of city of Dublin and see the countryside.  As a Marriott Platinum Rewards member I was enticed by the opportunity to stay 2 nights in a wonderful hotel using only Marriott points.

The resort is just a short 30min ride from Dublin and the scenery on the way there is grand.  Upon arrival to the resort, which was later than expected due to rain, we were kindly greeted by Andrew who checked us in quickly and offered an upgrade to a suite.  The bell hop Stephen cordially grabbed our bags and escorted us to our rooms after a quick overview of the property.  The room was wonderful and included nice amenities such as a rain shower, towel warmer, TV in bathroom, HUGE wardrobe room, digitally controlled lights/air, etc, and a moderately stocked mini-bar.   All was well!

The resort did encounter a significant and truly unexpected issue with a water pump malfunction on day 2, so my wife and I were w/o water for nearly 12 hours.  Somehow the resort managed to operate despite this fact.  I did feel as though the resort was not forthcoming about the seriousness or expected duration of the water outage, but it did not ruin our stay.  Samuel and Andrew handled our concerns professionally and we were thankful for that. 

We were able to get reservations to the Spa downstairs and I would HIGHLY recommend it!  The facilities are wonderful (pool, sauna, steam room, hot tub(s), relaxation room with a view of the mountain, a ""cold water bucket challenge"" (you'll have to ask about this but worth the jolt), not to mention a wonderful massage.

All in all I would recommend the resort as a getaway for a couple nights or long weekend. 

TIP: Be sure to go see the Powerscourt Gardens just a short 5min walk away.  Absolutely beautiful, especially the Chinese Garden. 

TIP: Bicycles are available for free to tour the grounds.  Note however...YOU CANNOT BIKE to the waterfall.  You must drive to it. 

TIP: Stop at Johnnie Foxes pub/restaurant on the way from Dublin to Powerscourt.  A wonderful Irish pub, rich with history and character.  WELL WORTH THE STOP and a great place for a pint or two.  Note this is not associated with Powerscourt at all but is just a 5-10min drive away.",4,2014,11,24
217,Grand!!,"What an amazing hotel, I really enjoyed the fact that the RC service is still present in every member you interact with although the approach is made on a very casual way.
Robbie at the concierge desk is the man to talk with, he knows the sorroundings of the hotel like no other and can really help you if you are not willing to take a 40 minutes ride to the city.Also he his a great host, he showed us to the room and took the time to explain all the facilities around the hotel.  The food outlets are really nice, you can choose from a traditional pub (McGills) within the hotel and Sika, the fine dinning option. Both were very good. In the morning breakfast was of a great choice and Agnieszka was super helpful and courteous which made the begging of the day even better.
Explore the beautiful Powerscourt Gardens only 5 minutes walking distance and Powerscourt waterfalls (take a bike ride if the weather is on your side , they have them available!!) And make use of the pool, sauna and steam room...just amazing.
I would also like to mention the effective way they have dealt with a water outage on Saturday, it is one of those things that happen always at the wrong time, but we were promptly made aware after receiving a message at our TV. 
My only constructive feedback goes to the state of the floors, furnitures and the lovely wooden pieces  around the building, those are quite worn and should be touched up or refreshed, but surely management is aware of it.
All in all, this was a great stay in a grand hotel, with peaceful surroundings and great Ladies and Gentlemen making sure you experience the best of the Irish countryside!

I will come back and definitely recommend your hotel!",5,2014,11,24
217,Excellent as usual,"From start to finish the hotel staff can't be of more help. We stayed in what they call a Superior room also called a 'larger guest room' online. It really was quite large. The beds and bedding are very comfortable. It's nice that the rooms are well maintained with the furnishings and fittings all in good order. The wifi throughout is free to connect to and works well - nice to see as so many hotels don't offer this.
At breakfast time there is a comprehensive selection of food on offer - I don't think you could want for more. 
We stayed with 2 young boys (4+7 yrs) who thoroughly enjoyed the stay as well. It's big enough for them to explore. There is no kids club or internal play area as this hotel doesn't seem to get a lot of families staying but that's not to say that kids are frowned upon. But there is an outdoor play area not far from the water feature in the hotel garden.",5,2014,11,24
217,Solid,"Still reminds me of a Ritz Carlton, at least from a decor and service standpoint. The hotel is relatively big, with private parties and graduation celebration happening the time that we were visiting. Enjoyed the proximity to Powerscourt Estate and waterfalls, and the staff was extremely nice and obliging. We were dining at the pub, but because the noise got too loud, the staff was more than happy to pack up our yet-to-arrive main courses so that we can take the food back to our room to enjoy. Breakfast was plentiful. The indoor swimming pool is big but well utilized by guests. Driving in the area can be challenging. I often found myself on narrow country roads where U turns and even backing-up were impossible.",4,2014,11,19
217,Excellent Hotel - Cant wait to go back,"I had been to this hotel previously when it was the Ritz Carlton so did not quite know what to expect. I was very pleasantly surprised - standards have not changed. Receptionist on checking in (Niamh) was professional and courteous. Room was upgraded from a classic to a suite without me having to ask. All information on breakfast, facilities etc was given.

Room was absolutely amazing!..Top of the range everything!..What i remembered from previous visit was the bed and it was just a comfortable as i remembered...Room was spotless and the temperature perfect. We had a wonderful nights sleep - did not hear a sound all night.

Pool was lovely and warm and sauna / steam room great ( Bucket of cold water to pour over yourself when you came out was a great touch)..Only disappointment was that the hottub was closed for renovations. There were plenty of fresh towels in dressing rooms which too were spotless.

Breakfast was delicious - a great selection and plenty for everyone.

I cant not wait for my next visit!",5,2014,11,19
217,Night away with a group,"Fabulously decorated and shire eloqance but not five star with the overall package taken into account!  The Spa is wonderful, lovely staff with a blissful ambience.  Bedrooms fabulous and spotlessly clean, no change of towels or bottled water as advertised.  We had an evening meal, nothing to boast about, just average.  Breakfast on Sunday morning was also of about 3 star rating.  Our table was not set for breakfast, and nobody made an effort to set it until we asked.  We also had to ask for the menu from the kitchen as we did not want buffet breakfast.  The coffee pot came to the table with the lid damaged, not closing fully.  For the rate charged, it was not value for money to be honest.",3,2014,11,19
217,Amazing,"I will try to be brief, this hotels is amazing. Absolutely beautiful inside and out. This is a 5 star hotel. Our experience began at check in. The young lady who was assisting us noticed I had just celebrated my 60th birthday a few days earlier and wished me a happy birthday and asked if we would not mind being upgraded to a suite. Naturally we accepted. The gentleman that brought our luggage to our room was so nice and showed us all the features of the room. My wife and I are not rich and have never had such a magnificent room. It was stunning. We spent a week at the hotel and can tell you the staff is beyond amazing. They made us feel special even though there were hundreds of others staying at the hotel. The pub in the lower level was one of our favorite hangouts. The staff and the manager went out of their way to make us comfortable and provided excellent service. For example one night we were standing by the fireplace enjoying the warmth when the manager came up and asked if we would like to sit directly in front of the fireplace. We said yes if it would if not be a problem. He said it was not and arranged a table and two chairs for us. It was very romantic sitting together in front of a nice Irish fire. We strongly recommend this hotel. There is so much around the grounds to see and walking is fantastic.",5,2014,11,17
217,Luxury retreat for family,"We live in Dublin but wanted a getaway, ideally with a pool. Powerscourt hotel is set a stunning location. You enter through the main gate and drive past a tree lined avenue surrounded by beautiful countryside and the wicklow mountains. The hotel is impressive, quick check in. Very big room which was their standard, big bath, wet room, king size bed. Everything done efficiently and without fuss. We went for a swim in the pool with our 3 year old which was really nice, and I went to the very well equipped gym. My wife enjoyed a 1 hour facial and we ate a simple pub dinner in McGills on site with an open fire. Breakfast was a very impressive buffet. For this sort of luxury its not cheap but I felt that it was very reasonably priced for the location, facilities, rooms and staff etc.",5,2014,11,17
217,The perfect retreat from Dublin,"Our third visit to the hotel and fantastic experience again. The facilities of this property are phenomenal, from the huge rooms to the iconic sugarloaf lounge. Such a treat for those looking for a relaxing escape.
The staff is also an asset to the hotel, everybody is very professional  and helpful. Niamh at Reception and Michaela at the Spa are exceptional.
Thank you all for making our special weekend a big success. ",5,2014,11,16
217,Amazing getaway only minutes from home,"I spent a weekend with a friend as a way to disconnect from husband and babies at home - only to be pampered :) 
We weren't let down. We had some issues with the check in which (they didn't find our reservation) but they made it up by upgrading us to a suite. 

The room was amazing, cozy, and with every comfort you might need (and more). We also used the spa that same afternoon (amazing - again) and had dinner at the lobby level restaurant which, I must say, wasn't up to the expectations I had - After 20 minutes of being sitting down at the table I had to tell someone to come and take our orders as we had been completely ignored - for that reason the drinks were on the house - and when we made the check out I had to tell them they didn't include the entire dinner on the final bill (and we were actually telling the woman at reception what we had for dinner - not very impressed by this) Next morning the breakfast was amazing, (delicious scones!) and very friendly staff.
Overall we had an incredible time! we rested and felt pampered at all times.
We will definitely be going back! (though I wouldn't chose the sugar loaf lounge as my first option but will try the one below instead)",5,2014,11,15
217,Fantastic ,"This hotel, the Spa and Sika restaurant was just fantastic. I really couldn't have had a better stay.

The spa is one of the best I've been too, and I've seen many. Top quality all round.

The room was great, very comfortable and had a small suite. The bed was extremely comfortable.

The food at Sika was amazing. My wife the the fillet of beef which was incredible. I had halibut and cooked perfectly.

All in all great.

If I was to critique then they should have a valet, though the guys were there they didnt offer to take the car.. Surprisingly as it a nice car!!!!
",5,2014,11,15
217,Very Impressed!,"Where to start!! What a great place, once you arrive as I did have some issues trying to speak to someone in the hotel to reserve the room, lots of hold time, but it was worth it!
On arrival, Paul at the front desk kindly offered for us to upgrade to a suite (just €60) it was so worth it! Craig the bellman kindly brought us to the room and gave us a tour!! 
The suite had a lovely bathroom, the bed is so comfy! We ate with friends in the area so didn't have dinner on site. Breakfast was very nice, I am gluten free and they accommodated that very well.",5,2014,11,13
217,Outstanding !,"Recently attended a conference here and from the moment I arrived, I felt like I was in a different world. The drive up the avenue to the hotel was fab, with all the autumn colours of the trees, I was kicking myself that I hadn't brought my camera. All staff I encountered were extremely pleasant and happy to help and point me in the right direction. Breakfast and lunch was supplied and the food was excellent. The room the conference was held in was perfect for the size group which were in attendance. Would love to stay over and experience there swimming pool and spa treatments but living in Wicklow, its highly unlikely but you never know ! Would definitely recommend..",5,2014,11,13
217,Beautiful resort,"Our company brought us here for an awards travel trip. Landed in Dublin and took a bus to this resort. It was such an awesome experience with a very hospitable staff, excellent food,  first class rooms and two lovely golf courses. The golf courses were within walking distance to the motel and also spectacular gardens. I highly recommend this facility!",5,2014,11,12
217,Love love love this hotel!,"First, let me say that I read the recent reviews prior to writing this as one of the concierges expressed disappointment at some negative feedback.  It appears to me the negatives came only from people who had visited when it was a Ritz Carlton establishment and were disappointed with the hotel since it was taken over by Marriott.  We have never stayed in a Ritz, so can't speak to the difference, but found this to be the best hotel experience we have ever had.

The staff is friendly and helpful as well as efficient. The concierges bend over backwards to make your stay in Ireland the best it can possibly be.  The rooms (we have had 2 stays) are clean and comfortable, very large and luxurious.  The TV even greets you by name!  

We wish we knew the names of every staff member to say thanks to, but, alas we don't.  So we will say thanks to Robbie and Liz, concierges, the sweet reception desk girl from Venezuela, and the lovely young man who picked us up in Enniskerry the night we got a flat tire!

The location is remote and quaint; the village close by is small but has wonderful restaurants, pubs, a few shops, and an award winning bakery.  We found the people living and working in Enniskerry to be welcoming and friendly.

If you don't care to drive to Dublin, the bus picks up hourly in Enniskerry and it's about a one hour ride.  Be sure to know where you want to get off in Dublin because that can be confusing!!!

We happily recommend Powerscourt and can't wait to return for another visit!",5,2014,11,12
217,'DONT GO',Arrived Saturday afternoon for a' romantic' overnight stay from Dublin. Reception werent particularly happy to see us. I dont take lifts - so 'Receptionist Paul [--] subsequently sent me twice on a 'Wild Goose Chase' to our room- If it hadnt been for a helpful Cleaning lady  who took pity on us - we would probably still be searching!! Things didnt improve from there and Service levels throughout our short stay were probably the worst we have ever experienced in any quality Hotel we have ever stayed in. After eventually finding our room - we tried to get lunch in the restaurant however we were directed to walk around the packed lobby area with books and laptop in hand whilst the maitre d -Orla was on the phone and then after she finshed ..she still made us wait whilst tables were being given out to local guests. The room was excellent however at this level the least i would have expected was a Turn Down service...but lo and behold this wasnt included in our price. Checkout was what we expected..'Did we take anything from the mini bar?...Not -' how was our stay'..in actual fact- she was lucky she didnt ask as we would have told her. We paid €530 for our overnight stay (to include dinner) Needless to say...We wont be back.,1,2014,11,12
217,A luxury stay on a beautiful estate,"Although initially apprehensive about this being a huge, American hotel we soon found that the friendly, professional staff and luxurious facilities deserved the five star status. Our room was generously proportioned with two bathrooms and a separate sitting room but we still enjoyed sitting by an open fire in the lobby for coffee and to read the papers.  Food and service at breakfast and dinner was excellent and the spa was a treat. I enjoy swimming and  the dark pool wasn't for me but the atmosphere of the spa was lovely. We enjoyed the short walk to the nearby house and gardens - such a shame that the building was gutted by fire so is now the home to several craft shops but the gardens are beautiful.  We would definitely return.",5,2014,11,11
217,Experience the Irish countryside,"Great staff, great service, nice hottub and pool.  The grounds are listed by National Geographic as 3rd most beautiful in the world and we agree.  Short beautiful drive to glendalough to see the old monastery grounds   The concierge was amazing.  He was so helpful and knowledgeable.   Loved this place",5,2014,11,11
217,Beautiful Hotel,"Great hotel to treat yourself or someone special to a day out for afternoon tea or lunch,
or splash out and stay over night .
The food in the hotel is a bit expensive and not to everyones taste so head to the bar for great food and something to please everyone.
we stayed overnight , the room was gorgeous with fab big bathroom 
the only complaint i had was that the tea and coffee facilities in the room had only the little wooden sticks you get in Mc Donalds to stir your tea !!
for a 5* hotel i found this VERY strange .. also thought for the price we might have even got a coffee biscuit .
Also if breakfast is not included in your room rate , it is €28 per person !!
Be sure to go for a walk around the grounds and why not pop up the The Powerscourt Gardens for a lovely day out in this fabulous part of the country.",5,2014,11,09
217,Going down hill,"Visited for 1 night, found that it's slipping in the quality issues since the Ritz Carlton stepped away, for instance curtains did not meet together and were ripped at end, stains on carpet, no turn down service was offered, check in was not super friendly, food offerings did not really spark a great interest in any of the restaurants, no focus on local items/or chefs, did go to mcgills pub had shepherds pie, so-so can make better myself!! 
So over all I would say 3.5 *out of 5!! ",3,2014,11,07
217,Stunning location,"Formerly the Ritz Carlton, this hotel is now under new management.  I hadn't been there previously.  The location is simply stunning. It is hidden away (quite an achievement given its size) in a valley in the beautiful Powerscourt Estate.  The hotel is lovely, the staff were very welcoming and even though it is a very big hotel it managed to have a cosy enough feel.  We were upgraded to a suite which had a sitting room, large bedroom, dressing room and large bathroom.
The beds were very comfortable.  There was a selection of magazines in the sitting area which was a welcome touch. The bathroom was spotless with gorgeous Espa toiletries.  The highlight for my son was the TV screen embedded into the mirror which could be viewed from the bath.
Breakfast was excellent, one of the best breakfast buffets I have encountered.  There was a very impressive choice of food from homemade pastries and breads to delicious cooked food to smoked salmon and a pancake maker (which delighted my daughter).
The lights and air con are controlled by panels, one inside the door and one each in the sitting room and bedroom.  They are touch screen and not the most sensitive so it was occasionally frustrating trying to sort out the lights.  Also one of the children was accommodated on a comfortable folding bed in the sitting room and it was challenging to find a way to turn off the lights in the bedroom without turning off the lights in the sitting room at the same time.
The only negative was the bar food that we had on the first night. Four of us ate - two had burgers, one had bacon and cabbage and I had a chicken caesar salad.  The burgers were deemed to be very good.  The bacon and cabbage was very good, an excellent piece of delicious bacon with well cooked cabbage.  My Caesar salad was incredibly average.  The dressing was poor and there was really nothing to justify the relatively expensive price.  We shared dessert.  At €9 for  Banoffee we expected great things but it was a banana chopped into a bowl with some crumbed biscuit and a very small amount of caramel poured on top and then a ton of whipped cream on top of that.  Again, at that price it should have been exceptional.  We had arrived into the bar just before a large business group departed for a function into an adjacent room.  Until they left we got no service and when they left the mess they left behind was not cleared that quickly.  Yes, we clearly arrived at a busy time but if there is a large function on in the hotel the bar should be adequately staffed at peak times.
So with the exception of some elements of the bar and its food I would thoroughly recommend this hotel and will happily return.
If you are staying there you must go to Powerscourt House further up the drive. Take a walk around the gardens (voted number 3 IN THE WORLD by National Geographic) and eat in the fantastic Avoca Cafe in the house.  There isn't a better way to spend a half day in Ireland.",4,2014,11,07
217,Absolutely breathtaking,"Myself and colleague checked in on Saturday as we were attending the ISIA awards. On arrival, to our surprise, we were upgraded to the Presedential Suite, due to the large number of rooms booked. We were astounded by this - but even more astounded by the Suite itself - absolutely stunning - a suite worthy of celebrities, not 2 people who had flown over from Manchester! Not only did we have an en suite bedroom each but also, dining room, living room, kitchen, private roof top terrace and a hot tub for our use.

Everything about the Powerscourt Hotel is impressive. Set in beautiful surroundings, with the mountains to marvel at as the sun sets and rises. The staff were absolutely faultless - they could not have been anymore polite, and welcoming if they tried. Must mention Paul on Reception, who thanks to him our one night stay was made even more memorable, and to Harry our lovely porter who assisted us.

Breakfast was just as lavish as the hotel was - the waiting staff could not wait to assist us in any way we required. I seriously need to win the Lottery now to be able to return with my 16 year old son, so that he too can enjoy a wonderful stay - as myself and colleague did.",5,2014,11,04
217,Bliss and avoca nearby,Lovely time long wait for breakfast as very busy lovely break dinner gorgeous expensive not really sure I'd go again could do with extras I. Room no water and minibar outrageous expensive nice area beautiful walks ,4,2014,11,04
217,Magical few days after our wedding in June,"We had the best time staying here with our families after our wedding in June 2014 held in nearby Blacklion. The rooms were amazing,  great views, modern,  spacious and impeccably clean.  We ate at Sika and it sure was a treat, they were very accommodating as I am vegan. We also enjoyed a very good meal at the sugar loaf lounge as well as at the pub. Afew more vegetarian /vegan starters, mains and snack options would be most welcome, just as a  point for training purposes. We were treated like royalty by all the staff from guest services to reception to waiters and waitresses, we can't wait to come back real soon with any of our friends and families from overseas to show off this gem in the beautiful powerscourt estate. Big thank you to all hotel staff for making our lovely break one to remember for years to come. ",5,2014,11,03
217,Beautiful rooms and view,"Still retains the feel of the former Ritz Carlton resort that this was - very large lobby area, nice gardens etc.  Our mountain view suite was luxurious, large with a crystal clear, unobstructed view of Sugar Loaf Mountain.  We were greeted by a wonderful bread and cheese plate on arrival.  We decided to enjoy casual drinks and dinner at McGills, and the service and the food were outstanding.  There is a large parking area on the premises, so we were able to easily self-park. The breakfast buffet area seemed a bit overwhelmed on the Saturday morning that we were there.

There were a couple of issues which we didn't bring up because they were minor and we only stayed overnight.  One issue, which may have been due to the season, was that there were quite a number of dead or dying flies by the window of our living room area - probably should have been caught by whoever delivered the (covered!) bread plate.

This hotel was a very convenient launching point to explore the entire Wicklow Mountains area down to Glendalough.",4,2014,11,02
217,So disappointing - we left early!,"So much has changed since this property was sold by the Ritz Carlton group - not for the better! As mentioned in another review, standards have slipped, we found some of the public areas quite dirty and there was a stale smell especially in the Sika restaurant. On arriving in our room we found no recognition of our anniversary and on entering the bathroom we found hairs on the towel. We regularly travel during school holidays and so we expect hotels to be busy however this hotel no longer has a characterful, intimate, secluded and luxurious ambience instead with a large conference in attendance it felt like a city centre hotel. All we had hoped for was a break from our busy, busy life and a few days rest.
It is difficult to comment on service because we experienced so little. At check in, the female clerk didn't even provide the most basic info about breakfast times. Even though at 7.30am with only two other couples in the Sika restaurant we were not informed about the full range of breakfast items available (eg poached eggs) and having been shown to our table none of the waiting staff made any further attempt to interact with us. Perhaps staff are encouraged to be unobtrusive but they have taken this to the point that they are inhospitable. While seated in the lobby it was impossible to get attention and indeed we felt invisible. Our experience was so poor that we decided to leave early. At check out we waited patiently whilst the clerk was clearly dealing with the complaints of another disgruntled guest. I was surprised that he was interested to know why we were leaving early because he had not been so concerned the previous evening when I enquired about charges for an early departure. I wonder if this ""interest"" was due in any part to the presence of a more senior member of staff. His final comment summed up the stay ""We know that you won't be back.""",1,2014,11,02
217,Missing teddy bear the only blemish,"It's hard to fault this hotel.  It's rated 5-star, but we weren't sure if it would really live up to it.  In terms of lobby and reception area, room quality, pool and spa, grounds, food quality, and service, I think it scores high in all areas.  We booked a 2-night midweek stay for 2 adults and 3 kids - ages 9, 6 and 4.  They gave us a 1-bedroom suite, with 2 Queen beds.  The kids stayed in one, although it was a bit tight, and we would order an extra pullout bed if we went again, or if the kids were older.  The living space was good, with good doors and sound separation between the bedroom and living area, so we could have a chat after the kids were tucked in.
We ate lunch at the Sugar Loaf Lounge, dinner at McGill's bar, and then dinner at Sika restaurant.  Sugar Loaf was good, although expensive for what we got.  We found McGills a little strange at first, as it really does try to be an ""Irish Pub"" in the hotel, wooden tables etc.  But the dinner there was really good quality pub grub, the stand-out dish being a recommendation from the manager, bacon and cabbage.  If you go there and you have any interest in bacon and cabbage, you MUST try their version.
Dinner at Sika the next night, kids safely with the hotel-provided babysitter, was excellent.  The Sika deer is a house speciality and also in the ""must-try"" category.  Duck breast was super, and the raw tuna starter is very good for a non-sushi restaurant.  
We used the pool every day with the kids and they absolutely loved it.  It's dimly lit and very ""cool"".  Changing rooms are great.  We didn't avail of any spa treatments.
Throughout, the staff were very good.  Helpful, and friendly.  Especially in McGills and Sika, we were very impressed.   (In McGills, my 4-year-old complained when given a menu that he couldn't read and therefore the menu was ""useless"" to him.  The waitress sat down and read it to him!!)
We managed to walk the Powerscourt Waterfall (day 1), 7km of trails at Glendalough (day 2) and the Powerscourt Gardens (leaving day), and I would strongly recommend all three.
So, this place exceeded our expectations in almost every regard.  You feel well looked after and even pampered here.  It's not cheap, and this is probably clear from the online information, but at least you get what you might expect from a 5-star hotel.
And, unfortunately, we left our 4-year-olds lifelong companion teddy in the room when we left and he is missing ever since.",5,2014,11,02
217,Excellent stay,"Having just returned from a two day stay at this wonderful hotel, we a family of 2 adults and 3 teenage boys return home with very happy memories of our stay yet again.

We have stayed here when it was the Ritz Carlton and were a little apprehensive, however from the moment we arrived all our doubts were gone.  The rooms were beautiful as always and I think no matter what room you are allocated, looking out over garden and mountains is fantastic. The room or suite is large enough to accommodate all five of us, with a good size sitting room also.

We ate the first night in the restaurant, its not cheep, but well worth it, food was fantastic, Waiting  staff need to be a little more attentive, as we felt we got forgotten about towards the end of our meal, forgot to bring us tea/coffee and extra drinks.  Breakfast was very good, plenty of choices. Morning staff excellent.  

We also went up to Powerscourt Waterfall, this is definitely a must.

We look forward to our next stay.  Thanks to all.",5,2014,11,01
217,Beautiful hotel marred by standardisation and penny-pinching,"We have stayed in Powerscourt since it was the Ritz-Carlton and several times recently since it became the Marriott and have noticed a decline in standards. 
The building and rooms are lovely, but in a hotel of this standard, I would expect more than one tiny tube of shampoo secreted in the shower in a suite. When it was the ritz-Carlton, the toiletries were more generous and included bath crystals - which are no longer there.
The breakfasts is now standard American-style buffet with no possibility any longer of ordering a freshly-cooked egg. The scrambled eggs are made from a package- mix and the rubberised fried eggs are all uniformly round and languish for hours on tepid trays. 
Service in the breakfast and lounge areas is slow, and the staff are not as friendly as when it was the Ritz-Carlton.
Such a shame in a hotel that should be luxurious and special.",3,2014,11,01
217,Amazing gardens and building,"Just on Dublin's outskirts this is a lovely place to stay. It is definitely 5 star accommodation and the service is good but I think lacks some of the warmth that you find elsewhere in Ireland (especially in the South). We stayed in a mountain view suite; room 452 (I think this is the better view) which was large and decorated in a formal English country style. It was very comfortable. Bathrooms were great: 2 toilets, 2 basins in main bathroom, lovely deep bath; large shower and a tv in the mirror which my daughter was particularly impressed with. There was also a walk-in-robe which felt luxurious. The room lights and cooling, messages etc were activated using touch pads which were conveniently installed in all rooms and in each side of the master bed. 

Breakfast was included in our package and was typical Irish hotel breakfast; very good on the whole. We had a light dinner the first night in the hotel ""pub"" which is on level 1; it was ok food-wise; service was friendly. The second night we ate in the casual dining area just off the lobby it was ok again, but none of us raved. We had to wait a very long time between ordering and getting our meals which was annoying. When I asked what was happening though the waiter was very honest that the chef had run out of fish and had to get more from downstairs. He assured us our meals were 5 mins away (correct) and offered us a round of free drinks, which was nice (we accepted). I think dining in the Sika Restaurant might be a better experience.

The spa is a lovely Espa and the relaxation and thermal areas are very nice. The pool is 20m but all internal so no views. I had a deep tissue massage which was not that great - I often find that hotels don't do remedial massage well as they cater more to pampering. This was probably the case here.

On the whole Powerscourt is impressive but after our wonderful stay at The Europe in Killarney I felt it was lacking some of the warmth and the luxurious finishes of that hotel. Still a very nice place to stay.",4,2014,10,30
217,Amazing setting,"Just back from a two night stay with my husband. I'd read so many reviews in advance, some good, some awful so I was really looking forward to seeing what the hotel was like. We were celebrating both a big birthday and our anniversary and I'd been lucky neough to get some gift vouchers for the hotel as presents which were ideal as it is vvv expensive.
We arrived on a Sunday and lobby was very busy but it was lunchtime and I hadn't exected our room to be ready. The receptionist said she could upgrade us at a reduced cost of 20e per night to a suite which was ready so we said what the hell, why not.
Room was fab, huge bed, fab bathroom. Everything we needed and more. 2 cons - tv was on wall facing the window so couldn't be watched in bed. Really silly place for it be be fixed. Also room was facing onto carpark, no view which was a pity.
We had dinner booked that night in Sia restaurant. Food was of a high standard but service was hit and miss. There seemed to be loads of staff, but no real management. I saw a waiter come with our main courses on a  tray, set them down and disappear. Tray sat for approx. 2 mins before someone else finally served us. When there are adeuqaate staff it only needs a restaurant manager to train them properly.
Brekfast was lovely. Very busy on first morning, we had to wait to be seated about 10 mins but it was a bank hol. weekend so we didn't mind the wait. Plenty of food to suit all tastes.
Proximity to the gardens is ideal and they are worth a visit.
I'm going to specifiy a few other issues we had:
Bar - McGills in basement is a bit grotty and dark, pretty souless. Ok for a couple fo drinks but we didn't fancy eating there. Its a pity for such a beautiful hotel not to have a nicer bar. The Lounge was always full so we couldn't eat or have a drink there.
Leisure Centre/Spa - I'd a last minute nail file & paint with a loverly therapist. Would have loved a longer treament but I left it too late to book and they were full. Spa looked really nice. We both used pool but again it took us to the 2nd day to find the hammam suite as no-one showed us around even though there were loads of staff.
Pros: Reception staff etc very good. We were able to get dropped to village by courtesy car and ate there on 2nd night and got picked up again, v. handy.
I would go again biut bring your wallet, I do think its over priced.",4,2014,10,29
217,Afternoon tea,"We have been here many times before but this afternoon decided to have afternoon tea. They have a nice selection of sandwiches, desserts and teas. The ambience is great and the views are fabulous. The service is friendly and prompt but afternoon tea is expensive. Previous visits have included dinner and overnights stays which i felt were better value for money. 

Overall the hotel is excellent but this will be the only time we sample their full 'afternoon tea'.",4,2014,10,26
217,Breakfast was disappointing.,"I was there last Friday for a dinner and a overnight stay.  Staff are excellent. Everything very good until next morning.  But the breakfast were very poor. The continental breakfast is a plate  fruit and coffe with a couple of toast. No bread, pastries, cheese or ham. Also the quanity would not feed even a child. I had to order some pastries which was all sweet and cold (not fresh). So I ask for an Irish Breakfast after since I was very hungry and they charged me extra for that. Disappointing for a hotel where you pay for a great surprise not for frustrations. I would recommend to have a breakfast somewhere else. ",4,2014,10,26
217,"Great Service, small hotel feel in a large place","The Powercourt was in a beautiful location in Enniskerry Ireland. What a setting located beside the powercourt Gardens. The Staff here was great especially in the breakfast restaurant and pub. I Loved how they provided free rides into town. 

They only drawback (which could be considered a benefit) is the distance from the city about 30 mins 40 from the airport. But to be in the green hills of ireland was definitely a pleasant place to call home for 6 nights while on business!",4,2014,10,25
217,Real Pleasure,"Beautiful hotel in walking distance to Powerscourt Gardens, which is so worth a visit.  Our room was luxurious with an amazing rain-head shower.  The stay was pricy but was so relaxing and I would return again if I got the chance.  The staff was not as friendly as I had experienced at other stops, but was professional.  I will say the gentleman who brought us to our room was great!  The wait staff seemed the most ""frustrated"" of the people we interacted with.  We were celebrating our 17th Anniversary, and unfortunately did not make a reservation in the restaurant, and they could not accommodate us so we had our ""diner"" in the bar, the only that could take us.  Other than that, it was a great stay.",5,2014,10,23
217,4* at best,"My husband and I stayed here last weekend and were not impressed with the hotel. 
We paid €300 for one night & there was no turndown service. After speaking to reception we were told this is only done on request. 
The food in the Restaurant  was generally good but the service was hit & miss. They forgot the sauce to my main course & the side of broccoli was so over cooked it was yellow & mushy. I informed the waitress and she replaced them for me. However when I got her attention later in the meal to request a side plate for the cheese she said ""I thought you were going to complain again"". 
Breakfast is a very basic buffet. 
The spa is excellent & would return there for a day package. ",3,2014,10,22
217,Fantastic overnight stay,"Will start with the negative - rang the hotel to confirm booking to find they had no record of my booking. Not a good start, complained and got to deal with the Guest manager Robbie Smith.  Well were we the lucky guests . Robbie advised us that he would make sure our visit was flawless and that it was.

If you have never been to Powerscourt hotel you just have to go.  On arrival into Enniskerry you will see what Ireland is all about. The scenery on the drive up to Powerscourt has to be seen to be believed . 

 On arrival Robbie upgraded us to the most wonderful suite,  The staff where very welcoming and attentive wherever you went in the hotel and what a beautiful hotel, truly 5 star.  There are wonderful scenic  walks outside of the hotel, if your lucky enough for it not to rain, well its Ireland. If you are fortunate enough to be staying a few days you have the garden of Ireland at your doorstep.

We had a fantastic meal that night in the Sika restaurant, really quality food, every mouthful was full of taste.  Thank you powerscourt for a lovely stay but most of all thank you Robbie for looking after us so well.",5,2014,10,22
217,Powerscourt is a MAJESTIC PALACE - YOU MUST VISIT!,"When the family and I pulled up to the newly bought (about 7 years ago) Ritz Carlton-turned-Marriott mansion, I was SHOCKED...jaw dropping eyes rolling in the back of the head shocked. As first timers in Ireland, we had just spent 4 wonderful days falling in love with the charms of Dublin and all it's historical sights. Wanting to see more of the local land and countryside, we made the quick trek to Powerscourt Estate, our next and final destination, via taxi. 

The term ""hotel"" does NOT do this place justice...it is a true palace! After our stay at Powerscourt, it immediately earned the title of nicest, most luxurious, sophisticated, majestic Marriott operated resort I have ever stayed at...and luxury is my middle name. 

Layout: The grounds were lush green, open-spaced, and conducive for hiking, nature walking, and paved for a wonderful, breezy walk to the historically-preserved Powerscourt Gardens and Commercial Shops. When you stay here, you feel like a newly appointed King who doesn't know what to do with all his riches. There is a large restaurant - more like parlour- on the second floor with exquisite views of the grounds of the estate, facing the back. I loved sipping an afternoon digestive tea while nibbling on a crisp buttermilk scone while having interesting conversation (with the family) and feasting my eyes on the breathtaking view. The estate is so classy and sophisticated, you almost feel like you don't belong there (which I probably didn't!). 

Service: I find Irish men and women naturally charming, good-humored and more on the delicate side (breaking stereotypes here) and that said, I found the front desk, concierge, and room service attendants super accommodating and polite. If they were disgruntled at their guests (or me for my constant in-room sloppiness), they hid it like true professional actors. Rooms were kept tidy on a daily basis, extra touches were performed, and rooms were equipped with all American necessities...like US outlets. Breakfast was buffet every morning in the downstairs restaurant which was diverse enough to fulfill the most picky appetite. Only discrepancy here was not having the option to eat breakfast elsewhere, since theirs was included in our stay as Marriott members. This only became more of a drag towards the end of the stay when I felt the urge to eat something other than salty bacon and milky eggs. Diet-restriction items like gluten-free, vegan were a bit harder to come by, forcing me to carb up on irresistible danishes and croissants. 
The main restaurant at the Powerscourt Gardens is outstanding! I HIGHLY recommend eating there and sampling their quiche options and colorful salads. I love that the Irish cook for taste and flavor and are always honest about their ingredients and farming sources. You can tell they haven't been totally consumed by total industrial food commercialization which I was greatly appreciative of. 

Rooms: Let me just say...in our double suite room, we had an ENTIRE veranda and balcony complete with stone jacuzzi, high views, tables & chairs, and remaining room to pace around like the King in the King and I. The rooms were majestically adorned and bathrooms (my favorite room in the house) had all the fixings, including magnifying mirrors, separate vanity and enormous counter space. I felt like Elizabeth Taylor while she filmed Cleopatra....but without the early set-calls. Rooms were a 7++++!

Pros: Everything: the location, the nature, the views, the people, the avoca sweaters, the tasty food, and the historical preservation of the Estate.

Cons: The fact that I probably gained 3 extra pounds from all the bacon and cream in the food and for my quenchable thirst for a highly-caloric scone.

Forget the naysayers...next time you're in Ireland, MAKE A TRIP TO POWERSCOURT!",5,2014,10,20
217,Nice for a treat but would better value elsewhere.,"Recently stayed here for one night.  Had been really looking forward to it and first impressions were fantastic.  Greeted by a porter (kind of like visiting the Abercrombie and Fitch shop) upon arrival who took our bags and when we checked in we were upgraded to a superior room with a balcony which was a nice surprise.  We were then shown to our room which was amazing however, unfortunately, the balcony overlooked the utility area so wasnt too much to look at.  

We went for a walk along the River walk which we needed a private code from reception to access.  If you are stuck for time, give this a miss as there are nicer walks to go on.  Didnt see a river, just a tarmac road.
 
We stayed on a saturday and hotel seemed completely booked.  We had to wait a while for lunch in the lobby restauraunt - lunch was fine, the main hotel restauraunt was fully booked for the evening so we settled on the bar which was very full but the food was decent enough for bar food.

Visited the Spa but obviously missed something here as I know there is other facilities but only found the pool - We werent shown where the other areas where when we arrived (not a big deal as I'm not too interested in spa's)

Positives:
Check In / Porters and bar staff were all brilliant - couldnt have been more helpful.
Amazing grounds

Negatives:
Difficult to get dinner - would recommend reservations if staying on a weekend (this was our own fault admittedly)
Bar staff seemed very busy - very helpful / friendly but seemed over-run at times.",4,2014,10,20
217,The best waiter Dario Di Nocera,"Dario Di Nocera waiter in powerscourt Has been of great help during my Stay in hotel, and I want thank him And all staff of hotel located in a beatiful area of ireland among the green Trees and park, gardens and falls. Relaxing strolls and good food.

217,Gimmers of its former glory days,"Perhaps our expectations were too high of this former Ritz Carlton.  The building's exterior looked rather shop-worn.  Our room/suite looked very nice and was quite spacious, but little things could be improved.  In both bathrooms, the toilet paper holders came apart.  The handle came off a door, the touch panels in the nightstands did not work, and very little info. provided about the amenities.  We were surprised to discover a fee to listen to music.  Wifi was free.  Mini bar was very expensive.  Restaurant choices were rather limited and the Sika restaurant was pricey.  The buffet breakfast had many choices, but an omelet station would have been nice.  When we inquired about lunch venues, we were not told about the cafe at the shop building. It was open limited hrs., looked very nice, but our schedule prohibited us from trying it.  Instead we had a so-so lunch in the lobby restaurant. My husband was upset when the pub, on the lower level, converted our tab to US dollars, charged a fee for such exchange, without asking us, then gave us the bill with the statement that we had ""been informed about the exchange and agreed to it"".  We prefer the credit card co. to do the exchange and asked the pub manager about the fee.  He told us that they ""had to"" according to Powerscourt rules.  The front desk denied that they had issued such a rule.  My husband thought it was a scam to collect the trensaction fee from unsuspecting guests.  Also, food in the pub was nothing special.  What's with mushy peas with fish and chips?  The pool and hot tub area were very serene.  However, apparently not cleaned very often.  Several pool chairs had used towels on them and there were only 3 other people in the area.  I looked unsuccessfully for a brochure with spa services and prices.  Parking was free.",4,2014,10,18
217,Mixed feelings,"Marriot has always been our preferred hotel chain in the States so when we had the chance to spend our last 3 nights of a month tour of Ireland at Powerscourt we really looked forward to this beautiful building and location.  It was a nice room - spacious but strange layout - desk too big for the space. Worse was the lousy view of the dirty retaining wall.  Touch panel lighting and AC control seemed like a good idea but on first night all lights came on at 0200. Third night all the lights went out at 2100 while we were trying to read. Got up and  turned them on then every 15-30 minutes they shut off again.  Went to bed and around 0200 again they came on by themselves at various intervals for the next 5 hours.  Very aggravating.  Didn't call desk as we didn't want any more disturbance of staff coming in the room.   Told reception at check out and they apologized and gave us a 10% discount on last nights rate but we lost a lot of sleep that night before our 14 hour trip home.   Also disappointed in the restaurant choices. Sika menu limited and too pricey. McGills pub unappealing menu and decor dreary not pub-like at all.  The lounge bar area off the lobby had the best view and the menu was good but for a hotel this size the selections for dining were limited.  And 28 euros for a buffet breakfast - seriously? Most we paid in other luxury hotels in Ireland was 12.50 euros.  
Front desk staff friendly, especially liked Jake. Disappointed there weren't more Irish employees.  All in all loved the luxury but not really 5 star standards. Black finger prints on the bathroom door, dirty grout in toilet room floor. Marriott - you can do better. And forget the fancy technology until it is perfected. 
Also the beautiful exterior seen in all the publicity photos is actually the back of the hotel not seen unless you hike around to the garden area. The entry on the 4th floor  is much less impressive.",3,2014,10,17
217,Can't wait to go back!,"This was our second trip to the Powerscourt hotel. It is located in such a beautiful area of Ireland and is just so convenient from Dublin. We were able to get up on the morn we were leaving, have breakfast and be back in Dublin for work so quickly. There is so much to do around the Enniskerry area. We spent a day hiking Lug na Quilla and I knew that I had a gorgeous bath to look forward to whilst watching tv back in the hotel!  My idea of heaven. We had dinner in the hotel restaurant that night - The Sika restaurant. Really good food. The breakfast the next day was a very high standard. We were able to sit outside on the balcony and read our papers and soak up the view of the Sugar Loaf. We did the lovely river walk that afternoon which is very pretty. I felt completely relaxed after our stay at the Powerscourt hotel. Gorgeous bedroom. Would highly recommend as it is so fast to reach. No time wasted travelling but yet you arrive in a beautiful countryside area.",5,2014,10,17
217,A great alternative to Dublin hotel...,"Due to a recent business travel to Dublin and majority of hotels in Dublin was full which forced me to look near Dublin and ended up in Enniskerry area and stayed at Powerscourt. It was wonderful experience but also somewhat annoying at the same time. It is minor things but nonetheless expected service from top class hotel.

Location: Let say it is both good and bad. If you need to go into Dublin daily basis, this hotel might not be an ideal location. However, if need to visit outside of Dublin area, it probably is more convenient from Enniskerry than from Dublin. Hotel is situated private land with beautiful garden (fee) and golf courses (two 18-holes courses) so it has a lots of space. Getting to the hotel takes some getting used to (narrow road) and most likely will need a car or taxi. If you have transportation, it should not be an issue. Be sure to check out garden as view is great from there even though there is a fee to enter. A quick glance at the entrance can be accomplished at garden café where you can bet tea/coffee or light lunch.

Hotel: Hotel has great architecture and it looks like a castle from outside. It looks more impressive if you are accustomed to modern building with high-tech features. European converted castle to a hotel is probably most accurate description. Check-in process was a bit of wait as I did not see a dedicated counter for Marriott members. I think this hotel used to be Ritz-Carlton so not sure why it does not have one. There were quite a few guests checking in that day and wait was over five minutes and dedicated counter would have been beneficial. 

Concierge:  They were very helpful and efficient getting things done. We had luggage delivered when we switched rooms and also from storage when we went out of town. 

Parking: Ample parking spaces available but it can get very tight squeeze depending on car next to it. Some are covered and some are uncovered so take you pick depending on the weather. No parking fee for either lot. 

Housekeeping: This is the weakest area of this hotel and it needs to be improved. Of my twenty years of travel experiences, this is the first time I had to leave a note to housekeeping to vacuum the floor. I even collected some debris aside next to dining table just to see if it gets cleaned and it was there when I returned in the evening. The same goes cleaning of bathroom floor as dust, hair, and lint does not get vacuumed.  Cleaned dishes and silverware are not replaced daily and we had to ask a few times to restock them.  Considering such good hotel, it was very surprising to find a basic housekeeping rule not being followed. Two tea cattle failed during my stay and both were leaking from the bottom. It looked old and not sure if defective unit gets discarded. The first room, the work desk main drawer had missing handle and I used checked luggage tag sticky tape as a handle for two days. It was still there when I switched the room. Something like white tape stuck to the drawer is obvious and visible to housekeeping and should get replace. I am willing to bet drawer is still missing a handle.

Room: Room was spacious and comfortable. Our room had basic kitchen and espresso machine as well. For long term stay, eating outside becomes old and ability to heat prepared food was nice alternative option. There are ample closet spaces for everyone. The first room we stayed for a few nights had an issue. The water pump noise coming from nearby fountain which must have a recirculation pump near by the room and it was making annoying sound at night. So we asked for a quieter room and it was much better. However, that room’s mattress was seriously sagged and it really should been replaced in my opinion. My guess was 2-3 inches of sagging has developed which was visibly noticeable. We did not change the room because of the sagging bed as I preferred quieter room. We spent final week at a different room and bed was not a problem there so it will be a hit or miss. The room Internet speed was very good and it is free of charge. 

Bathroom: Bathroom is spacious and shower booth is great as it has been renovated recently and it shows. Bathtub and shower booth is separate unit and toiletries are excellent. Bath towel has high cotton counts and generous in size and bathrobe is provided which was also very good quality.

Restaurant: Great place to enjoy meal and servers were very friendly along with tasty food. Either having a beer at the bar with light snack or afternoon tea, you will not disappoint with all available choices.

Golf: I had to work but my spouse did try one of its 18-hole courses and it was average experience for her. Understandably there are so many great golf courses nearby and by comparison, it just was not all that impressive. Price was 55 euro to play for hotel guest.

Sauna: She has very tense neck and shoulder muscle and does not impress easily but she was raving about their skill so my hats are off to the staff. If you are into sauna and massage, give it a try. I think it was 135 euro including a lunch during weekdays and 150 during weekends when we stayed. 

Overall impression: I will definitely stay at Powerscourt when I need to visit Dublin again and I can safely recommend to my friends and colleagues. There are minor issues and I do wish hotel management will address those short comings near future.",4,2014,10,16
217,Great Retreat,"Spent the last 3 days recovering here from a 10 day Med. cruise. One of the finest hotels I can remember staying at. The grounds surrounding this place were fantastic, truly story book. The hotel staff were just as amazing, helpful and gracious at every turn.
Would return in a second.",5,2014,10,14
217,You get what you pay for!,"And while you certainly pay quite allot for it here, the hotel certainly gives back in shovelfuls! As another reviewer wrote- every reply was 'certainly sir'. The room was fabulously comfortable. While its not The Ritz anymore, and it shows in places; exposed wiring on the hairdryer (quickly and efficiently resolved by their inhouse electrican) and no answer from inroom dining (not enough people to answer the phones during a busy period was the explanation)

But otherwise the pool/spa was lovely, relaxing and not overcrowded. Dinner in Sika was busy but well serviced. 

All in all it was a pleasure, and when I can afford it again - i'll be back :-) 
",5,2014,10,14
217,Sugarloaf Lounge view breathtaking but some service improvements needed,"We've been in this hotel when it was the Ritz Carlton and dined in both the Sugarloaf Lounge and the Gordon Ramsay Restaurant on many occasions. The location is just as spectacular as it has always been but on this visit getting a table in the Sugarloaf Lounge was more Fawlty Towers than a five star hotel. When we asked if the empty 'reserved' table at the window was actually going to be used we were told it was, so we asked could we sit at the vacant table one back from it on which some used empty cups were sitting. This seemed to cause quite some consternation as not one but three staff had to check and decide if that was possible. Eventually the Maitre d'  decided it was okay but we would have to wait while it was cleared and asked us to sit on the nearby settees (which were all occupied!). How long does it take to clear a table with a few cups and disinfect it we thought, so we stood while it was done in about two minutes flat.  
As to the 'reserved' window table we had been refused, quite some time later when a large group, who had seemingly booked afternoon tea, arrived, they were, after a few moments of discussion with the Matre d, ' given it as an alternative to the tables at which they were first placed, and nobody came to occupy those when we were there,so it seems the table we asked about was not actually reserved at all. Not good. Our visit was nonetheless saved, indeed made quite a wonderful occasion by the actions of our young Irish male waiter (from Wicklow) who without being asked served us with copious amounts of Irish charm and even went to the trouble of serving us strawberries with our Champagne and producing delicious (hotel made?) chocolates to go with it when we mentioned one of our party was celebrating her birthday. This young man will go far.",4,2014,10,13
217,Pure relaxation in a beautiful location,"We had a spa break, the facilities were great.  The location is amazing and the food was lovely.  I would go again.  Great for hiking and bike riding also.  We had a room with a mountain view which was great to wake up to and lovely while enjoying dining in the room.",5,2014,10,13
217,Tranquil Powerscourt,"My husband and I recently celebrated our 20th wedding anniversary at the Powerscourt Hotel. It was a thoroughly enjoyable stay. We chose to eat in the bar rather than the restaurant and had a lovely meal with all the atmosphere of an Irish Country pub. The views were fabulous and the walks through the grounds were very interesting,as was the visit to the nearby shopping centre! 
Highly recommended for its peaceful setting and tranquil atmosphere.",5,2014,10,13
217,One of the best in Ireland,"Booked the Princess suite which had no less than four TVs in the room, Study area, Dining room, lounge, 6ft bed, Remote control for everything, Could even run a bath from the bed using the remote. Stunning Wicklow/ Sugarloaf views from the room and Powerscourt Gardens next door. Fabulous restaurant and service. Golf across the road and full spa facilities. Possible the best hotel in the country",5,2014,10,11
217,Beautiful hotel but......,"After staying at Gregans castle and Ashford castle (the best of the west coast) I was highly disappointed with what is supposed to be the best hotel of the east coast. We pull up to this beautiful place and no greeter, no bellman , no valet service, nothing! We go to check in which was fine and asked to book horseback riding for early in the am. They direct us to the concierge desk, we go there and it is unattended (at 4pm) we go back to front desk and they say he will call us in our room shortly.  We shower and dress and head back out for dinner and went to concierge desk because he hadn't called. Guess what, empty! We go to front desk and they say he's gone for the day!?!? 7pm!!!   When will he be back? 9am, you've got to be kidding? No horseback in the am! We have dinner which was very good. We get up in the am an have breakfast  it's a buffet with nothing special. We thought it was included, as they said it's open from 7 - 10am at check in, all other places included breakfast which were extraordinary! At check out we find it is not included in our room (although the website claims it is for almost all bookings) and they charge $56 euros for the two of us per morning plus tax , that's over $85 dollars for a buffet breakfast!!!!!! You have got to be kidding me!!!! The second morning we only had coffee and a yogurt!!   Staff is excellent but what the hotel gives you for the cost is not worth it!",3,2014,10,11
217,First Class Hotel,"This is an elegant first-class hotel located in a beautiful and secluded area of Ireland just south of Dublin.  It's a short drive to the Bray train station to get to Dublin, but it is surrounded by some of the most stunning scenery you'll ever see.  The service we received was fantastic and the room was very large and comfortable.  The one drawback was the price of the food...a small breakfast for the two of us cost over $75!  (If you want a great place to eat, drive into Enniskerry and go to the Old Forge Inn).  Overall, one of the better hotels I've stayed in.",5,2014,10,10
217,Gorgeous!,"One of the nicest hotels I've ever stayed in.  Beautiful setting, comfortable room, everything was prefect.  This used to be a Ritz, and it shows.  The staff was so nice and accommodating.  I don't know if we had a standard room or not, but we had a large changing room, large bathroom, living room and bedroom.",5,2014,10,10
217,Wonderful stay but very expensive.,"This beautiful hotel is located on a gorgeous estate with easy access to golf and the incredible estate gardens.  The rooms (especially the suites) are great.  They do seem to be understaffed.  For the price of the room and food/drink, I would expect more staff to be available.  Still a great stay.  I will recommend it.",5,2014,10,10
217,Our new Home away from home,"Hmmm, seems some people are surprised at prices for a 5* and some are actually surprised to find Pub standards in the pub ... gosh.  You know what I got when I went to Powerscourt???  ""yes sir, of course!""  Every single question I asked was answered with ""yes sir, of course!"" Is there any chance I could see the menus for the pub and restaurant while sitting in the upstairs lounge?  Yes sir, of course. Can we come into the restaurant while you are not open and sit on the veranda for a spot of tea and food from the upstairs lounge ... Yes sir, of course.  Service was exactly as I expected and required of a 5* ... beyond reproach!  My room ... I have to say I was blown away by the room. It was spacious with a sitting room and bedroom, and the bathroom was brilliant. The pool and spa area was extremely relaxing and enjoyable. You also need to go outside and play with the over large chess set in the garden! This was my first visit to Powerscourt Hotel but it won't be my last!! Air conditioning was a bit noisy at night, but that was solved by turning it off.",5,2014,10,10
217,Priced like a 5 star without the service to match,"The hotel offers all the luxuries for a 5 star resort however service was poor for the 24 hours we stayed. Upon checking in I was delighted to be upgraded. In the afternoon we had drinks and a coffee and scones. The table was fairly battle worn and in need of repair. When my Wife asked for a glass of water it was delivered in a large Guinness pint glass ! I ordered an Erdinger beer which is normally served in a labelled glass or at the very least a beer glass. I also was given a large pint glass. There is no doubt the location is superb however that evening when in the traditional Irish bar within the hotel we sat at a table which obviously hadn't been cleaned for sometime. After paying €17 for 1 pint and a vodka and cranberry juice, the very least I would have expected was a clean table. Perhaps the new owners of this hotel should concentrate on delivering quality of service and product to their customers when charging such prices. Also €3.50 for a packet of crisps really is going a bit too far.",3,2014,10,07
217,Rip-off Central,"Have enjoyed many a morning coffee with scones, jam and cream over the years. However, today has put a stop to such visits. Coffee (Americano) served in a small v-shaped cup (so the coffee goes cold in minutes) cost €4.80 per cup. The two of us had two cups of coffee each, and scones. Three tiny rounds of butter for four scones, and one little pot of cream. Total bill: €28.80, so €30.  

At those prices, they have lost out on what could have been a large family group. Not at those prices. 

While understanding that this hotel has a standard to keep up, it was obvious that numbers of customers have dropped. No wonder!",2,2014,10,06
217,Quiet and restful,"Stayed here for two days .It is a place that you go to for a completely restful time when you want to do nothing but relax in beautiful surroundings . It is expensive for most people and for that reason you need to stay here during the day rather than spend the days touring around Wicklow. There are less expensive hotels that can be used as a base when you just want a bed overnight.
The breakfast at €30 per person is too expensive for a buffet style that is available in any 4 star hotel at a more reasonable cost with just as much variety.
Used the Sika lounge for an evening meal and found it to be a very soulless place at night ,the glass surrounds are great during the day but at night let it down.
Staff are very attentive particularly the reception staff.
The village of Enniskerry is 5 mins away with a few nice cafes and breakfast is available here at a very reasonable cost. We used Poppies where the food is good and the staff friendly.You can also get a bus from here into Dublin or Dundrum shopping centre for approx €2.50",4,2014,10,05
217,Great Place,"This was a great place to stay with beautiful rooms and very helpful concierge staff. A former Ritz Carlton and now Marriott Autograph Collection, the property is first rate. Great place to stay to visit the Wicklow mountains and surrounding areas.",5,2014,10,04
217,Great place to stay in,"One of the best hotels I ever stayed in ! Me and my wife Spent a very nice weekend there few months ago way from the city and it's noise, nice gardens around and much to see ... A bit expensive but great value for money !",4,2014,10,03
217,True Hospitality,"We did not select the hotel for our visit; it was provided as part of a travel package. What a marvelous surprise that practically made our trip as we returned ""home"" each night to our elegant suite. Accommodations were splendid but more important to our trip, the staff was superior, friendly, and helpful in every way. Perhaps the best example of their consideration of guests was the ability to check in when we arrived at 10AM, weary after flying all night from New York, even though the check-in time is 3PM; our room was available so they provided it immediately. Being on the grounds of Powerscourt Estate made for an incredibly beautiful drive or walk for each day's plans. We felt like royalty!",5,2014,10,02
217,A very fine hotel,"We stayed for one night and had two dogs with us. We were all made to feel very welcome, the room was first class, with beds for the dogs. 
The view from the room is spectacular, but ruined by an ugly helicopter pad. When the third best garden in the world is next door it would make sense to improve the landscaping and view from the hotel. It would also help to paint the top of the long balustrade as one looks out the window from 4th floor.
The bathroom was first rate, though some attention was needed to the ceiling of the shower, and mastic and grouting. 
The electronics and phone in the room were irritating to use, especially the telephone. 
Dinner in the pub was average, the steak was not aged, a bit tough. The pub does not do justice to the hotel, more attention to detail and attentiveness of service would help.
Breakfast in the Lounge was excellent, a well stocked and very attractive buffet, and friendly service made for a very good breakfast experience.
The stay was expensive, especially when you see deals advertised in the Irish papers, hence four rather than five stars. 
The location of the hotel for those visiting Wicklow for the first time is magnificent, and the chance to visit the Powerscourt House and Garden should not be missed.",4,2014,10,01
217,Beautiful architecture,"The Hotel design and location were both amazing. The attention to detail was incredible. The budget must have been vast. It was a very special experience. A treat to stay there. The star lit Swarovski Spa pool was truly beautiful and we spent an afternoon just swimming and relaxing there. We would have liked a mid range restaurant choice.  The main restaurant 'Sika' was more formal and McGill's bar food was very informal. 
The location is wonderful with plenty of places to explore.  A real treat.",5,2014,10,01
217,Great place to stay,We recently had a 2 night stay.  On arrival we were upgraded to a suite - fabulous!  The restaurant could only accommodate us at 9.30pm but it was worth the wait - delicious food & great service. The McGills pub served excellant Guiness & tasty bar snacks too.  We would certainly stay again.,5,2014,09,30
217,Great location,"My husband and I stayed here last weekend for 2 nights.  The hotel itself is lovely and location is superb.  We stayed in a mountain view suite which was amazing.  The room was spacious, comfortable and clean.  One slight gripe would be lack of power outlet near a mirror (for my straighteners!!).  We ate in Sika both nights as it was included in the deal we got.  The food was nice but I think we may have preferred to eat in the bar one of the nights in hindsight.  The breakfasts was good - great choice of both cooked and continental options.  I had a few treatments in the spa which were good - not excellent but very pleasant.  The leisure facilities were excellent - the Swarovski pool is lovely!  I would say service in the main was good - but there were a few who were a bit snooty!  All in all a very nice place (if expensive!) for a romantic weekend away. ",4,2014,09,29
217,A great quality get-a-way with the benefit of Powerscourt Gardens close by,"An impressive approach and hotel entrance. Lobby area one of the best around with spectacular views.
Restaurant served good quality meal cooked exactly as requested. Some local staff to chat about the history of the hotel and original house & gardens would have made it not just a meal experience.
Mid level room with private balcony really worth having for the view and ability to sit out. Poor unfinished tiling (not grouted or set)  and maintenance of the balcony did not match the hotel room interior which was excellant. 
Mad touchpads for lighting etc. very poor method and dated now when using quality smart phones. Regular group lighting switches far more useable and that actually work.
Garden walkway paving require weeding.
Overall though a lovely place to chill out or have to have a romantic break.",4,2014,09,29
217,A great introduction to Irish hospitality,"We decided to book our first night outside of Dublin as we knew we would be tired. We like to stay in Marriott's as my husband is a gold member for life and it usually translates into nice things. This was no exception. We were given a lovely room in a lovely hotel. The grounds are quite nice and while we did not have a view, everything was clean, comfortable and well cared for. A previous review complained about no outlets in the bathrooms but I think that is country wide as we found no outlets in any bathrooms. We ate in the pub which was just fine and had a bountiful breakfast. We actually also stayed another night here toward the end of our trip. I would highly recommend this hotel. A bonus to this location is the Powerscourt Gardens which are a short walk. They were magnificent.",5,2014,09,23
217,Amazing,"This hotel is a true retreat, set in wonderful grounds. Check in was fast and very helpful with making dinner arrangements in the restaurant. Dinner was very good, food was hot presented well and tasted devine, however the service was a little hit and miss, wine not poured, bread not bought to the table at the beginning of the meal. Breakfast had a huge choice and staff were very attentive, however the food was not hot.
 The room was amazing , a huge clean room with a king size comfortable bed. Bathroom was modern and clean with a cool Tv built into the mirror. Overall really enjoyable and worth every penny, they just need to improve the service side.",4,2014,09,23
217,Wow,"Incredible spectacular building, incredibly over the top. Stayed here on business having got a fantastic deal from a local company we were visiting that was based on the Powerscourt estate.
I got lost a couple of times the place is so big , including in my suite !
Super place. If you're in the area it's well worth a try.",5,2014,09,20
217,Marriott,"We were here for a wedding at thus hotel. The hotel is pretty. The grounds are very pretty.  They say the golf course is very good but we didn't try it. The staff needs more training. Kleenex box was empty in our suite. No outlets in the bathroom. We had hamburgers at room service that were the worst hamburgers we've had in our life. Hotel is split into sections. You must take an elevator down and then another one up to get to your room on the second floor. One couple asked at reception if there was transportation to the airport the next morning. Reception said no, so they ordered a taxi. At the wedding reception they found out there was transportation for the wedding guests. Just lack of training at reception. One of my main complaints was no outlets in the bathroom. Terrible!",3,2014,09,20
217,Rooms with a view,"This hotel sits on a beautiful estate with outstanding views. Ideal for a conference, with modern, light and airy, sophisticated meeting rooms, of varying sizes. Delicious food to nourish participants, throughout the day & exquisite restaurants for the evening. Beautiful surrounds allows for fresh air & a change of scenery. All services incredible & staff very helpful. Rooms comfortable and spacious. Spa exquisite & leisure facilities thoroughly enjoyable. Would visit again for business, or leisure with family or as a couple. ",5,2014,09,17
217,fabulous in every way...never stayed in a better hotel,"Formerly Ritz Carlton but still under the Marriott umbrella, this stupendous 5 star hotel is as good as it looks! We stayed 3 nights in a mountain( i.e. Sugarloaf) view suite, which seemed to go on forever!!!  Modern, clean,supremely comfortable, with acres of space, huge private terrace, this hotel is a great choice for those who want a day into Dublin ( best done on the train/metro from nearby Bray, with tons of parking). One hour from front door of hotel via car to Bray, then train to central Dublin!). Peace and serenity of the Wicklow hills, the wonderful estate of Powerscourt, convenient 45 minute rural drive to Glendalough.  Dining is a bit problematical as there is a  pricy fine dining restaurant, and a pub in the basement, with not much in between. Check if you can dine in the lobby in the evening, which we did once, with great views through the huge windows, and the food and service were good. Staff friendly throughout. Room service breakfast for only 5 euros extra was  just like being in the restaurant....superb! Trouble sorting out our bill at checkout was eventually settled amicably. Great hotel in every way....you cannot possibly be disappointed with this hotel!!!",5,2014,09,17
217,"Relaxing weekend break , good wheelchair access","wheelchair accessible room was excellent , lots of turning and storage space . my only complaint is that it was not a twin room and my friend had to sleep on a cot bed. 
dinner in the restaurant was good on all three nights .  
service in the main lobby bar was slow .

great scenery surrounding the hotel .",4,2014,09,15
217,Underwhelming,"Nothing five star … except the prices.

We booked a one night stay as a special treat. Underwhelming. 

Criticisms: 

(i)	As we pulled up to the Hotel, we were surprised to see that the bins on the front porch were overflowing with rubbish (two coffee cups on the ground around the full bins, rubbish sitting in the ash tray among the cigarette butts). Another reviewer has already commented on this – why has this not been fixed? 

(ii)	On check in, we were advised that breakfast would be served in the Sugar Loaf Lounge (no mention of breakfast being served in Sika, which is much better for breakfast). The Sugar Loaf Lounge is a glorified “breakfast overflow”. Guests should not be directed to the Sugar Loaf Lounge as a first port of call for breakfast. And, while I’m on breakfast, fried frozen hashbrowns – seriously?? Again, another reviewer has already commented on this – why has this not been fixed? 

(iii)	The room key cards are not branded “Powerscourt Hotel”. I’ve never seen this before – a tacky generic key card with “Fáilte / Bienvenue / Willkommen” on it?? 

(iv)	We attempted to call Sika to reserve dinner using the “Restaurant” button on the phone in the room. An automated message said “Thank you for calling restaurant reservations at the Ritz Carlton, Powerscourt. We are unable to take your call but please leave a message etc..” This obviously has not been updated in a year?! We tried this button three times during our stay and could not get through to Sika / The Sugar Loaf Lounge / Mc Gills / Room Service – why has this not been fixed?

(v)	The water knob fell off in the shower (we called Reception and this was fixed).

(vi)	Housekeeping arrived for turndown at 8.55 p.m.. We explained that we would be leaving for dinner in 5 minutes and asked could she return to turn down the beds etc. She politely declined and said that she was finishing up – but handed us two bottles of water. 

(vii)	At breakfast, the (extremely young and inexperienced staff) in the Sugar Loaf Lounge wiped the tables onto the seats and onto the floor in front of our very eyes. We had to brush crumbs etc. off the (worn) upholstery before sitting down. The carpet under us was covered in croissant flakes etc. from previous guests. 

(viii)	A large amount of furniture (presumably over stock / damaged furniture) was strewn under a stair case beside the entrance to the Spa. 

(ix)	The towels in the Spa have been changed (since the hotel was a Ritz Carlton) from enormous cream waffle towels to small thin white public gym style towels. 

(x)	Most of the tea lights in the alcoves in the pool area are missing / presumably broken. The empty black iron stands are still there, mind. Very shabby looking.  

(xi)	One night B*B + dinner in Sika = €420. 

Really not up to scratch for (alleged) five star. Felt a little bit robbed …",1,2014,09,15
217,Stolen property,"I recently stayed at this hotel.  Having enjoyed a lovely family stay we were extremely disappointed to discover that a Garmin sports watch was left in our room & can not be 'found' i.e. It has been stolen. 
I would advise anyone planning a stay at this hotel to take care of their property. We will certainly not be visiting again! Not what you would expect from a 5* Star hotel.",1,2014,09,14
217,Best Hotel Ever!!!,"Having stayed all over the world, this was the finest hotel ever! Ammenities at the nicer hotels are essentially the same. What makes this place that special is the staff... They sincerely treated us like they were glad we were there, and wanted to ensure our stay was perfect. Most importantly,  everyone smiles because they are happy to be there! Thank you, thank you, thank you...",5,2014,09,14
217,Outstanding hotel and super service experience,"We stayed in the Mountain View Suite in August for just one night. It was an absolutely lovely room. Huge, clean, super comfortable, beautiful furnishings, lovely view of the SugarLoaf. It really was one of the nicest rooms I have stayed in anywhere. Very impressive facility in general. Well maintained. The hotel staff was really great as well. I have to single out Robbie, the Concierge. He was absolutely super. While at Powerscourt I proposed to my (now) fiance. I had called in advance to recruit some help in arranging a picnic and bikes, since there is access to the private river walk on the grounds for hotel guests, along with a few other extras like flowers and wine to be delivered to the room. Everything was spot on. All the arrangements we had discussed were perfectly taken care of. The picnic was excellent, everyone was discreet in not letting the cat out of the bag ahead of time, and we were welcomed back to the hotel by everyone out front. It was a super experience, and I want to express my thanks to the team there for helping make a special day, especially to Robbie. We had dinner at the restaurant that night and it was good. I have to be honest and say my one suggestion for improvement is on staff training at the restaurant. Our waiter could have been more knowledgeable about the menu and had a little less hauteur in general, but that said, the meal was still good and it's really not a complaint, just a suggestion. So, management, please take note; You've got a good one in Robbie. We'll be back!",5,2014,09,13
217,A precious rare gem,"My partner and I stayed at this lovely hotel in late Auust 2014. We were staying on a dinner,bed and breakfast package. We had a remarkable stay. The welcome we received was warm,kind and helpful on check-in. We stayed in a beautiful suite overlooking the entrance to the hotel. The room was immaculate,bright and very spacious. It had a massive bathroom off the bedroom and a powershower that I wanted to spend all day in,it was that good.
 The bed itself was amazing, I would have to say the best nights sleep I have ever had. You literally fell into the bed and it hugged your back and supported your legs in such a nice way. I could seriously write an essay about the quality of the bed it was that good!!
 I visited the spa to purchase some ESPA products as I use them and found the staff very helpful. The spa were running a special offer with products purchased and I received a free eye serum which was very kind as I was not visiting the spa for a spa treatment.
 We had diiner at 8pm and the restaurant was buzzing. Beautiful meal complimented with very good glass of wine. This made for a memorable night for us.
Went for a lovely stroll after our meal around Powerscourt before heading to the lovely bed for a good nights sleep.
 Breakfast the next morning was lovely. My only minor complaint would be the location where we ate our breakfast. We had hoped to return to the restaurant from the night before but were told it was fully booked. We did see plenty of empty tables there and we were taken to the main foyer area for breakfast which was a bit of a shame. Had we known that you had to book a table for breakfast we would have done so. My partner felt the young lady who met us in the restaurant was a little bit cold towards us when she asked us to go upstairs for breakfast as the room was clearly not packed at all.
  Overall a most wonderful visit. I will certainly return. I am sure it would be amazing to visit at Christmas. Well done to all concerned, an outstanding hotel.",5,2014,09,13
217,A strange experience. ,"From a distance it seem to be a classical 5 star Hotell , but at a closer look it is worn down. The floors are dirty with large spots from red wine as well as the chairs. Our table, very nicely placed at the window overlooking the garden, was decorated with a half dead flower. We had lunch at The  Sugarloaf Lounge. The staff was very friendly and helpful. We had chicken and fish&chips, both ok but nothing more. They need to really clean up their act to make it worth the drive from Dublin. A nice view and friendly staff is NOT enough. ",2,2014,09,13
217,As close to perfect as it can get,"Stayed here for a two-day conference with work. Have more or less only positive things to say. The room was spacious with a big bathroom. Surroundings were beautiful. The room was quiet, the spa area very nice and the breakfast and lunch buffet were very tasty. It's fairly close to Dublin - about 45 minutes by car. Good for both business and leisure.The only thing that the hotel could improve is the placement of electricity plugs in the room. Considering such a big room, I would as a woman have appreciated more light in the room and the possibility to use your hairdryer next to a mirror. There were no strategically placed plugs next to the mirrors.",5,2014,09,13
217,Umm WHY were we here for only ONE night?!?!?!,"This was the last hotel for our Ireland tour group and we were here for only one night.  We all came to Ireland to support the Penn State football team in their game against University of Central Florida (PSU won by the way!).   The Penn State athletes stayed here earlier.  As soon as we pulled up to the hotel, we were all blown away.  We walked into our AMAZING suites.  They had doorbells for goodness sake!!  The suite had a living room area, two full-size SOFT beds (a rarity in Ireland I feel), full mini-bar (pricey so we didn't try it), a dressing area, FOUR large closets, a bathroom with HEATED tiles and a TV in the mirror!  The bathroom had a full tub and a rain shower.  I did not want to get out of that shower.  Even the toiletries there were amazing.  Also, the lights and temperatures in the room are controlled by touch LCD screens on the wall and in the nightstand.  There is also turn-down service.  Amazing...  

After were done being in total awe of our suites, we explored the grounds.  Beautiful of course!  We met up with the rest of our group for one last hurrah at the pub in the hotel. Good service and great food there.  The next morning we had breakfast and the spread was very pretty and plentiful.  I wish I could have eaten more!  We checked out the gardens after breakfast which are another review in itself!  

It costs about 45 euros to get to Dublin city and 70 euros to Dublin airport from here.  They called a taxi for us the day before and had it ready when we were ready to leave.  The concierge was also very helpful by calling our airport driver to confirm our reservation (for when we'd leave the next day at another hotel). So yeah, this hotel basically set the bar for anywhere else I'll ever stay.  Looks like I'll be disappointed with hotels from now on!",5,2014,09,12
217,Beautiful property ..great location,"Beautifully appointed rooms -we had a suite but asked for a balcony which was obliged with no problem. What we got was a gorgeous suite with two bathrooms and a living area ! Amazing. We adored the town of Enniskerry which is a short drive from powerscourt. We had a jam packed agenda so we did not get to use the Powerscourt property as much as we wanted to. However we did visit Mcgills pub for appetizers and beer it was a nice place but lacked the authenticity of a real irish pub which we found in other towns. We also ate at Sika one night since we arrived back late and all town restaurants were closed. Food was good, but overpriced two course meals and a bottle of wine was €150 and definitely not worth it. It was our most disspointing meal in Ireland. We live in NYC and we preferred to eat local and casual as opposed to fancy and commercial. Lesson learned. Finally I took a star away because one day our room was not serviced. We came back to dirty towels and an unmade bed not what I would expect from a 5 star hotel. We didn't bother to call the front desk as it was already late and we are not the complaining type but it wasn't great to be out walking around all day and to come back to an unmade bed. There were also huge spiders that came out brazenly at night. We assume it is due to the wooded nature of the property however it wasn't pleasant to have one or two of these guys run across the floor while you are brushing your teeth. Again we didn't mention it because we figured it was uncontrollable. We would recommend this place overall the location is great for travel. Bray is a 10 minute ride and that town has great dining options and the DART train station as well. The property boasts wild horses and amazing views and greenery. The concierge is very helpful if you need a taxi or recommendations in town. Try the Powerscourt Arms for lunch. The Old Forge Inn had some of the best food I had in Ireland ( bacon and cabbage) and Poppies or Kennedy's for breakfast or coffee. All are in Enniskerry you won't be dissappointed .",4,2014,09,11
217,"This a bucket list location, you have to try it","We had a supper to remember for the rest of our lives.  The staff were extremely freindly, the rooms and common ereas spotless.  If you have a bucket list you have to add Powerscourt to it.  My wife had two spa treatments and felt like a million dollars afterwards.  Beautiful walking trails, do the river walk it is so very scenic.",5,2014,09,10
217,"Location is phenomenal, hotel is very good",Great hotel to get away and unwind.  Surrounding properties are well kept and the Powerscourt gardens are impressive.  The beds are crazy comfortable and the large suites are spacious.  Limited dining choices onsite but the food is good.  I would stay here again.,4,2014,09,09
217,Amazing hotel,"Hotel is exceptional but what really makes the experience is the location, it is a very special setting being amongst the Powerscourt Gardens as well as two golf courses..and the pool is cool.  A very pleasing experience.",5,2014,09,07
217,Wedding,"Had a really lovely stay for friends wedding.   The wedding good was exceptional, and the atmosphere was really nice too.
Room was really big, and very comfy. Was worried as we were at the front of the hotel so thought it may be noisy but no probs at all. 

Breakfast was equally enjoyable.

Only downside - could do with a lick of paint here and there. 
For 5* luxury everything should always be perfect, but this didn't really affect us to bd fair!!!

Stay here for a bit of indulgence in stunning settings.
",5,2014,09,07
217,Relaxing,"Waited here for one night in August. The room itself was fab and I loved the bathroom, the television in the bathroom mirror is unique. The room was very spacious with a walk in wardrobe. We got breakfast delivered to the room the next morning and it was delicious. The Irish bar in the hotel was the busiest part of the hotel and we ate our dinner there. The food was good and it opened from 6pm. 
We walked to Powerscourt gardens just 5 mins away and it was a lovely way to spend a relaxing day walking around them.

The only negative things I can say about the hotel is the gardens on the hotel. I thought they were run down and in need of some TLC. 
I also thought the hotel should have some music in the hotel to create more of an atmosphere as it lacked something.",5,2014,09,06
217,Loved it,"Excellent, great countryside and lovely village near by. Room was perfect, large and marble bathroom, huge bed, great views, great breakfast and food. Pub was nice with good food and a good pint of Guinness
Highly recommend for a quiet escape in luxury.",4,2014,09,06
217,something missing,"Myself my partner and our six year old son stayed here for 3 nights and had a lovely time, however it just wasn't the 5 star experience we expected and its quite hard to put my finger on what was missing. First of all the hotel was beautiful and our one bedroom suite was stunning, huge and luxurious. When we were first shown to our room the member of staff that took us there must have been in a hurry because he just walked quickly round the room muttered something about a hairdryer and was gone, all in about 10 seconds and considering the size of the suite that was quick!!. on my sons fold away bed were slippers and a robe, he's 6, they were the same size as the robe and slippers that were left for my partner and I and it wasn't until the evening before we left that I saw two children walking round the pool with kids robes on, when I asked the spa receptionist about them she said yes they were in house robes and she phoned housekeeping to get us one straight away. First morning I couldn't find the hairdryer because of the quick wizz around the room, had to go and ask at reception, its in a really handy place actually, but hard to find if you don't know where it is. The food we had in the sugar loaf lounge was nice enough but so very expnsive., we only ate here one night because of price then we found a local pub which was fantastic (powerscourt arms), we absolutely don't mind paying for good food but this was just to pricey. Nothing complimentary in the room except tea and coffee, which again took some hunting before I found it. Just small things that didn't ruin our experience but could have made it better. Breakfast was ok, not hot enough for me but that's a personal thing. The children's play room was a mess and we wouldn't let our son play in there. The location of the hotel is fantastic, lovely walks round the grounds and into enniskerry..  Just not quite what we hoped for",4,2014,09,04
217,Outstanding,"I love the Powerscourt.  Everyone is so accommodating.  I really enjoyed the recommendations for everyone working there, the ease of traveling to the village and just the general wonderful atmosphere.  Everyone was just so nice.",5,2014,09,03
217,Powerscourt - Makes a Powerful Impression,"We stayed at the Powerscourt hotel - what a gorgeous drive and backdrop!  We felt like royalty as we entered the grounds and the historic setting - previously owned by the Powerscourt family.

We were greeted upon our drive in by three wild horses....our children just squealed with delight to stop and pet them as we entered the grounds.

Our room was amazing (amazing woods, sprawling lawns with chess set in background) against the mountains - the beds were pretty comfortable...better than the typical Marriott.  The pillows were great and duvets splendid!

We had scones on our arrival the second time we stayed - we checked out and returned.  We had french pastries (assorted colors) upon our first arrival.

They had a converter for hair dryers, etc. 

The bathrooms were amazing!  Glass doors for the shower and bathroom - a mirror in the shower (which had a rain shower! and handheld option).  The mirror in the bathroom had a  built-in TV!

The room decor (chandelier), colors, tapestries, couch, etc. was all fantastic! Loved the hardwood floor and marble in the bathroom! 

We purchased the handmade chocolates from the mini bar - well worth the treat!

Didn't get to partake in the pool - children's hours are 9am - 7pm - but would love to another time!  Pool is only open until 9pm also!

Again, no bed rails for beds, so if traveling with young children, bring your own if needed.  We were able to push the bed toward the wall to prevent falling....but again you need to come up with options.

Laundry services at the hotel are available but cost about 10-12 euros per item.  We found a launderette in town (Enniskerry) but probably should have done the laundry with Marriott.

The staff went above and beyond every time!  I would say it's 5 star service!

The meals in the pub, breakfast in Sika restaurant and dinner there - were FABULOUS!  The dinner was the best meal I had in Ireland!

When we left - we had room service deliver our breakfast - everything was on time and perfect!

This hotel is a premier location and well worth the expense.  It's a distinctive option that provides quality services and comfortable with children (our children are ages 10 and 5)!

We visited the gardens and toured the waterfall - can't miss it!  Just gorgeous!

If traveling to Ireland you must stay here or at least dine here!",5,2014,09,03
217,5 star stay,"lovely hotel, extremely welcoming , beautiful locations, lovely rooms, gorgeous spa, 
not a fan of the hi tech lighting in the room, prefer the old fashioned lamps rather than a touchscreen to turn on/off lights
brilliant breakfast

a luxurious night away",5,2014,09,02
217,Beautiful grounds,We arrived late on our last day in Ireland. We wished we had arrived earlier to take in all of the beautiful area. Our room was a suite and truly wonderful! We had dinner at the in house pub. The live music was a great way to wrap up our trip. Easy drive to the airport. The location is further from the city than I realized but perfect for a short stay. ,5,2014,09,02
217,Needs new mattresses,Overall very nice hotel with great views and beautiful rooms. Our room 615 had a very worn mattress that made me feel like I was sleeping on half a hammock. The center was still flat so I slept there for a few minutes to straighten out after my wife got up. This hotel is a new mattress away from being a five star destination. ,4,2014,09,02
217,Excellent,"This hotel is set in magnificent surroundings. The gardens are just amazing!
Staff is very helpful and polite. Rooms are just fabulous, very large room with great bed! Bathroom has got a walk in shower and bath tub.
Had a bite to eat and a Guinness or two... in the McGrill pup.
A shame I couldn't stay longer",5,2014,09,02
217,"Top class Hotel, lovely surrounding estate","For our 40th wedding anniversary I suggested a night away Margaret suggested the
Powerscourt hotel.We had visited the house and estate some years ago.we booked through booking.com and travelled down on Sunday morning. We were greeted by a very pleasant receptionist  who pleased us even further by informing us we had been upgraded to a suite.
The accommodation was superb and the Hotel and grounds pristine.
We had a couple of swims  in the excellent pool and a walk in the estate
 A pleasant afternoon snack in the sugar loaf restaurant and the fine dining in the Asoka restaurant.
This was the only disappointment.The meal was good but firstly to have a small menus and have two dishes unavailable was dis appointing 
My lamb loin which was supposed to be medium,slightly pink was overcooked  and. dry.
An enjoyable meal with good service in a lovely dining room but food not special
We really enjoyed our stay and would recommend the Hotel,perhaps try one of the other restaurants  Breakfast was good.
We stayed just one night as had to be back",5,2014,09,01
217,Great place to relax and enjoy the fabulous scenery and gardens.,"We stayed there for a few days before school holidays and it was absolutely great. From start to finish everything was excellent. Our room was first class and the service was faultless.When we checked in we were asked for a deposit of 100 euros which was added to our room rate and taken from the credit card upon arrival.This  i was surprised at. The receptionist asked had i ever stayed at this hotel before, as this was the norm.Usually you pay for all extras when checking out or that was what i had thought as hotel had all my credit card details. After all there is a rate of exchange which varies from day to day.I did not see the reason to take out 100euros one day and then put it back on to my card a few days later. There was a long queue checking out and this may have taken 20 minutes but it didn't really bother me too much as we were not in any rush home.I asked receptioinst about a room with a balcony for my friends 50th birthday for end of november but she said she couldn't guarantee one but it could be requested but not guaranteed, this was also strange but it didn't really matter as we have not decided 100% yet.",5,2014,09,01
217,"Beautiful Rooms and Great Golf Course, Service Not So Good","I have mixed emotions when writing this review.  The hotel is elegant and our room is large, comfortable and well appointed, albeit showing signs of aging, for example shower grout desparately needs cleaning or replacing.   We were VERY disappointed in the Sika restaurant.  For a resort of this calibre, we expected a great meal, with great service.  Service was poor and our waitress was not accomodating and frankly a bit rude.  We waited a long time for her to tend to us and didn't even offer us a 2nd cocktail.   Perhaps it was becaue it was a Sunday evening, but they offered limited menu (approx 6 starters and 7 entree options).  They were out of one of the starters and one main entree.   I have to admit we enjoyed the food but the prices were very high..two courses for 50 euros and martinis were 15 euros,total 130 euros for two with only one cocktail and no dessert.   On the flip side, we had a nice experience in the Pub where the service was much better.   I would highly recommend you dine in the Pub, or in the cute town of Enniskerry where there are four nice pubs to choose from.

The Powerscourt Golf course is five-star and reasonably priced.    It is impeccably groomed, has beautiful views and is a fun course to play.   I highly recommend using an electric cart or golf cart as it's very hilly.  It certainly was the nicest course I've ever played.",4,2014,09,01
217,Amazing place to stay,"I a word perfect , in every way. pure heaven on earth. Enjoyed the hotel so much from the room to the food to the facial to the swimming pool and most of all the atmosphere. From you booked in until you leave its fabulous.",5,2014,08,31
217,Fabulous Stay,"We loved the very high specifications to which the rooms were built and equipped. We saw high quality furniture and fittings that we don't see too often in modern/recently built hotels. We had a family birthday event and we found the staff and service to be wonderful throughout our stay. The food offerings which we sampled at all onsite dining ares were top notch, even in the (slightly small - but they are expanding) pub area. Breakfast time did get a little congested, but some very dedicated staff ensured that things got moving quickly. Our children enjoyed the swimming pool and we found the gym to be very well equipped. Would definitely stay again.",5,2014,08,30
217,excellent hotel,"must say this is a excellent hotel with excellent staff in a great part of ireland 
my problem is with the babysitting agency they use( BELGRAVE AGENCY/NANNY.IE) booked a babysitter with them for a wedding me and my wife where atteneding

5, a big thank you to Andrew at the front desk for finding a member of staff from the hotel to babysit so we could attened the evening of the wedding( after missing the meal due to BELGRAVE )

217,Great Anniversary Treat,"We celebrated our first anniversary in Powerscourt and had the pleasure of staying 4 nights there last week.It is situated in a beautiful scenic location adjoining the grounds of the historic Powerscourt House and Gardens & Avoca Café and located on the outskirts of scenic village of Enniskerry, a great location to explore the Wicklow countryside. The hotel itself has great facilities, an excellent spa lovely staff (very spacious his/her thermal suites and fabulous Espa products). We also enjoyed great quality casual food in  McGills Bar. The rooms in the hotel are of such high standard, we had a fabulous elegant suite so spacious, with beautiful  marble bathrooms( loved some of the  high tech gadgets, such as the tv in bathroom mirror and the electric touch screen controls for the lights) we will definitely make a return trip in the future.",4,2014,08,28
217,Beautiful,"Stayed here with my girlfriend for a weekend. Absolutely beautiful hotel, surroundings and rooms. Make sure to bring your walking shoes as it would be a shame not to visit the Powerscourt Gardens or/and the River Walk. Rooms are like mini apartments; huge, comfortable, clean. 

Can't say enough good things about the staff. In my opinion its the staff that make a stay enjoyable and the staff at the Powerscourt Hotel can't do enough for you. 

Amazing!! We will be back",5,2014,08,28
217,Spectacular,"We stayed here for a weekend and it was just fabulous.  I think the thing that stood out the most was the staff.  Every single staff member was helpful, friendly and so pleasant.  The hotel was top class and the rooms beautiful but their staff just made this hotel stand out by miles in comparison to other hotels.  I would highly recommend this hotel.",5,2014,08,27
217,Above and beyond,"I used my Marriott points to ""splurge"" on two rooms for our first 2 nights in Ireland.  I am afraid it may have spoiler the rest of the trip for us.  We landed in Dublin at 5:30 am from JFK.  It was aan easy drive down to the Powerscourt.  Out rooms weren't ready that early in the morning (to be expected).  While we waited my 71 year old mother was do exhausted she fell asleep in the lobby.  They kindly offered to let her rest in the spa serenity room.  They had upgraded our rooms which was a nice surprise.  They were huge eith balconies overlooking the mountains. The breakfast buffet is pricey but to die for.  They will drive you into Enniskerry to catch the #44 bus into Dublin and when you return the restaurants in Enniskerry will call to have the a dtiver come and pick you up. Our bellman got delayed on our way into town and he chased the bus down for us.  It was a 5 star experience in every way!",5,2014,08,27
217,Lovely stay for 2 nights,"I stayed in Powerscourt hotel for 2 nights after I got married. The rooms had lovely comfortable beds, the room was lovely and spacious. The bathroom and showers will great too. We tried the food in the bar and lounge, which was very tasty.",5,2014,08,26
217,Luxury surroundings in beautiful setting,"This hotel is chic and luxurious with very tasteful furnishings. The hotel staff are very welcoming especially front of house and in Espa. The hotel provides a complimentary car service to the village of Enniskerry and staff are very informative about the local area. The nearby Powerscourt House, Avoca and gardens are well worth a visit.

The only disappointment was the breakfast experience overall. The dining area was overcrowded and there was several diners waiting for a table. The food was not five star standard and the choice available was poor. Service was somewhat disorganised with lack of plates, cutlery and condiments during breakfast. 

I would thoroughly recommend this hotel for a relaxing experience but would hope management would think again about the breakfast experience for guests.",4,2014,08,25
217,Wow factor,Treated ourselves to a stay at Powerscourt Hotel for one night. A very memorable experience. Rooms huge with plenty of space to spread out. Extremely comfortable furnishings including the large king size bed. The estate is beautiful and very relaxing. Recommend a walk by the river and wander across to the golf club for a drink and/or meal. We had dinner at the pub on site which was busy and pleasant.  The hotel could have another casual dining room for guests to add another choice. Staff very friendly and accommodating. Thoroughly recommend this place.,5,2014,08,24
217,Wow,"Wow....What an incredible place to stay. We enjoyed the quietness of our stay. Close to the town of Enniskerry where we enjoyed a meal in Macs bar and then back for a relaxing night in our room. If you are looking for relaxation in a gorgeous part of Ireland, then this is the place to stay.",5,2014,08,24
217,Beautiful hotel in a stunning location,"We spent 2 nights at this luxurious hotel.The staff were efficient and courteous. Breakfast was excellent, probably the best we have had in any hotel -superb choice and quality. The hotel operates an 'honesty policy' which means that guests sign for food and drinks but the disadvantage seems to be that guests may find,on checkout, that their account lists items which they have not ordered or signed for. Although, in our case,  the account was amended promptly it did slightly mar an otherwise very enjoyable stay.",4,2014,08,23
217,Heaven on Earth!,"This is a beautiful hotel on a gorgeous large property. We were upgraded to a very spacious suite with a living room, beautiful bathroom with a tv in the mirror to watch from the bathtub...all the modern conveniences among elegant furnishings. Who would ever want to leave?
The included breakfast offered everything you could imagine to eat. I guess the only negative was the first day my husband and I found a games room and a small theatre on the first floor. He returned with our son to find none of the games were actually working and no remote in the theatre for the movies. But we told the front desk about it and I'm sure they could rectify the situation easily if they haven't already.
A first class experience!",5,2014,08,20
217,Couldn't recommend highly enough,"Myself and my sister stayed here to celebrate Our birthday and couldn't recommend enough how professional and accommodating the staff are especially Roisin in the bar, nothing was an issue for her and she has definitely swayed us to have a return visit! All bars/restaurants need a Roisin! 10/10 ",5,2014,08,20
217,A hotel with faults galore and no personality!,"We stayed here as a family of 3 and Aupair for 2 nights midweek in August and from start to finish was lacking any sort of professional guidance and management for a 5 star hotel 
The bar was closed for renovations ..... High season?? Which left nowhere really comfortable with a child to relax out in the evenings , the children's play area was like a dumping ground that hadn't been tidied in weeks, the grounds are not kept to a 5 star standard and sorry but the sugarloaf staff the first day we arrived needed total guidance from what I could see lots of guests had to really try hard to get service including us 
The food was delicious and very reasonable 
The reception staff were very friendly however I would of liked senior management to speak to me on a certain matter but instead was left very ignored...my return visit to this hotel left me positive never to bother coming again .... It's really lost its sparkle and it shows
Should of gone to Doonbeg!",3,2014,08,17
217,Fantastic Treat,"My husband and I stayed here for 3 nights for my Birthday. On arrival we were greeted by the porter who immediately took our luggage. We then went to Reception and we were greeted by the Lovely Monica who upgraded us to a Superior Suite as it was my Birthday which was a lovely treat. Our room was fab and so luxurious. I loved loved the tv in the mirror in the bathroom and the deep bathtub pure luxury. Lighting was fab in the bathroom for putting on my make up as I find a lot of hotels are so dark, the little touches like a crystal ring holder, the products in the room were what is used in the spa. Touch controls by the beside for the lights and closing of curtains. We ate in the restaurant and this I have to say was the only fault I had with the Hotel the food to me was tasteless and over priced at €50 for two courses per person. Peter served us and  was very nice and presented me with a little dessert and happy Birthday written in chocolate. The next day we had spa treatments each and they were fantastic and we also had lunch which was gorgeous and Emma the head Spa Receptionist gave my husband a free lunch as it was my Birthday a lovely touch. The pool is fantastic and a great length, a little tip make sure you check out the adult only times . The Spa facilities were the best we have ever used, Emma let us use the thermal suite the next day as well because it was a Birthday break. I forgot to mention the breakfast was out of this world !! We visited the lovely Powerscourt Gardens and really enjoyed this day they have a fab little Café there, with a great choice of food at reasonable price. We also visited the Powerscourt Waterfall, I have to say I found this to be a let down at €5.50 per person for entry to just to see the waterfall, the little shop was a disaster with 3 staff that ignored my husband he eventually walked away. The toilets were dirty.
 We had a fantastic relaxing break at Powerscourt Hotel  and so sorry to leave. It truly was a treat.",5,2014,08,17
217,Hit - with a few misses!,"Myself and my boyfriend stayed here on Friday 15th of August.  Loved the hotel, but the spa – not so much!  

TOP TIP: Book through the website – not through their reservations team!

THE GOOD
We booked a package – B&B in a classic room, Dinner in the Sika, and 2 50min treatments in the ESPA for 365. (Read the Section in the bad)
This is a truly beautiful hotel.  It surpassed my expectations.  We booked a Classic room, but we were given a Classic Suite.  It was HUGE! I don’t know how or why anyone would need a bigger room! It was perfect.  Gorgeous King Size bed, separate living room, separate walk in wardrobe – not even a wardrobe – another nice big room!  Large gorgeous bathroom with separate shower and bath.  We had a resort view – and it seems most of the rooms face the same way, the only difference is the angle – so whether of not you can see the SugarLoaf – again, if we were booking again we were delighted with our Resort View, and wouldn’t bother upgrading!  It’s gorgeous.
The food was gorgeous at both Dinner and breakfast.  We were both very happy with every single element.  Try and book a table by the window for Dinner though… we were awkwardly beside the kitchen and waiters station so it was a bit busy and we were a bit too involved in their business as you will see in ‘The Bad’.  We had breakfast in the Sugar Loaf Lounge which I saw others complaining about – but we loved it!  Best breakfast we’ve had at at any hotel.  The breakfast was buffet – just as that was what was part of the package – and I definitely recommend it! Wish we had more time to relax and enjoy our breakfast!
Even though we were checking out on Saturday morning, we were allowed do our treatments in the Spa on Saturday at 5!  This was a great service – and I don’t know if we were an exception to the rule, but we really appreciated this.  The décor and design of the spa is beautiful.
The staff in the restaurant, Lounge, and spa all go above and beyond to be nice!  They were all so professional and obviously well trained, and you can see all the really high standards they are made maintain! I’d imagine it’s a stressful job, but they never ever show it!

THE BAD

SPA
The Spa was the main disappointment – and that’s really why I had chosen this hotel.
Firstly, the Hot Tub was broken beside the pool so when I asked if there was anything other than the pool – we were told that we could use the Spa, on the basis of the hot tub being broken.  That was great.  But if it wasn’t broken – I’d still be disappointed.  I would have assumed, based on all hotels – even with lower ratings, that there would be a steam room and sauna for us to use! But usually that would only be for people who have paid to use the spa…
When we did use the spa I was even more disappointed!  We were on a couples  break – and the spa was separate for men and women.  I can’t understand why people would want it to be separate anyway, but when I go on a holiday with my boyfriend I don’t want to have to use the facilities separately!  So if I had really enjoyed the facilities – I wasn’t going to spend much time in them by myself as the purpose of the break is quality time together.  So we would get to the relaxation room, and then split up, and just try and guess when the other would be done so we’d meet back in the relaxation room.  It was a nuisance.
We used the Spa on both the Friday and Saturday evening.  On Friday, the men’s Sauna didn’t seem to be working, and the female sauna was also just warm – not hot like a sauna- I could have been in there for half an hour, when usually I would be struggling to stick 5 minutes.  On the Saturday they both seemed to be working.  On Saturday the female steam room wasn’t very steamy at all! On both days the Vitality pool  in the female area wasn’t very warm.  I heard other ladies commenting on these things throughout my visit.  It was warm enough to sit in for 5 minutes, but then you’d get cold.  The Vitality pool in the men’s on both days was cold.  Such a pity as it’s a really gorgeous setting , with a big window overlooking the resort.
The relaxation room was nice, but on Friday night I never saw one staff member maintaining it – so you would wander around looking to see which bed had been unused, and we couldn’t get two beds beside each other as so many needed to be re-dressesd.  On the Saturday there was a staff member wandering in and out, but not really fixing the beds.  Bring your own reading material as the selection of magazines is woeful! Couldn’t believe how few they had – and I’m not picky.  They were mainly men’s or interior decorating.  
This really let down our whole stay as we booked this hotel based on the Spa and all the awards it had won.  I imagine if judges visited when we had been there they would have been embarrassed… I certainly won’t be using awards to choose a spa in future.
We booked two massages as part of our package.  Again we were separated, which I wasn’t made aware of, and assumed we’d be together as I booked them for the same time.  Everywhere else we’ve been they’ve offered to keep us together.  It’s just nicer – a shared experience.  I thought my massage was great, and the girl was lovely.  My boyfriend found his only ok – and after some chatting it had turned out he was given an aromatherapy massage.  As I’d booked he didn’t realise there was an option.  My girl asked if I wanted A Swedish or Aromatherapy massage so I could opt for the Swedish – and that’s what I wanted for my boyfriend too.  I was really disappointed about all of this, and it was part of his birthday present.

MANAGEMENT
The staff were all so lovely as I said before.  However, the only negative experience we had, we felt was due to poor management.  
Check-in is slow! We turned up at about 1445 - and there were only 2 other couples in front of us and it took over 20 minutes.  We were so relieved when we turned around and saw some people would have to wait through 5 parties!  The receptionist was lovely, but surely they should have had more people on! Especially at this time, when most people were checking in and a queue was forming.  It must have been extremely stressful for her as people were frustrated with this.  We'd have been less frustrated if there wasn't only one person on!
At Dinner there was a mistake with our main course - they brought us out the completely wrong dishes.  We didn't mind at all.  We were apologised to by 3 different people - I think a manager and two waiting staff.  We made it clear we didn't mind, as we didn't want anyone getting in trouble - which of course they would... but we didn't expect them to get in trouble in front of us.  3 times we saw the waiter get told off 'discretely'.  We  could hear even though it was whispered mumbles, and the body language was so clear! We could only imagine what happened in the kitchen...and we ended up feeling bad for him, and somewhat guilty even though it wasn't our fault!

BOOKING
This was a last minute booking.  On Wednesday the 13th I emailed and asked for a package for B&B, dinner & Spa treatments.
On Wednesday the reservations team offered me:
B&B in a superior room (not even sure what this is, as online you can only find info about superior suites, if it was a suite surely she'd have mentioned it?) & 3 Course dinner in the Sika for 330euro
However I found a package on their website which included two 50 min spa treatments (valued at 210) for 365!

Obviously I went with this package, as it included what I asked for, and was a better deal!  The room turned out to be a classic suite also which was gorgeous and enormous.  It's a great deal as 3 course dinner is 60 per person.  So dinner plus the massages would have been 330! 

On Friday: The reservations person emailed me offering the same as she had offered on Wednesday - except this time with the massages, for 530 euro!  Pure madness, as the deal I got online was still available!  I found this disheartening, that people could have been taken advantage of, and asked for an explanation and recieved
""I would like to inform you that every day, all the rates and packages can change in base of our occupancy, availability of the rooms and the day of the week.""

That doesn't explain why I was quoted worse rates, before and after I booked online, and while the package was still available.  Surely they should be quoting cheaper if anything as they should be trying to fill the rooms last minute! I'm sure there will be a response to this, and I won't be able to respond on this again... but remember - we got a Classic Suite! So this 'superior room' couldn't have been better, or worth paying so much more for!

CONCLUSION
If the spa had been better we would definitely go back to this hotel and recommend it.  As this was a birthday gift I was more disappointed when it wasn't all perfect.

TIP
While you're there make sure you go to the Powerscourt Gardens.  We arrived early on the morning of our stay - wandered the Gardens and had a beautiful lunch in the Avoca there, which was the perfect start to our trip.",4,2014,08,17
217,Lacking that special touch.,"We arrived for an overnight stay to celebrate a special birthday.  We had reserved a suite and while the suite was beautiful there were maintenance areas that lacked attention.  Recessed tv in bathroom didn't work, it was really difficult to turn shower off and curtain mechanism didn't work.  We went down to spa looking forward to jacuzzi which was closed for maintenance.  Following enquiries we were advised to go upstairs to alternative jacuzzi. It was a recurring theme throughout our stay that we would receive apology, explanation and alternative.  Normally I would consider this to be good practice but when you have received about 10 of these on an overnight stay, it becomes exasperating.  We went to sugar loaf lounge as pub was closed (another apology).  We sat at the bar but it was frantic.  The one bar staff couldn't manage the orders coming in, then another staff member came to help him.  He had to consult a book for cocktails and in one case ask the guest how to make it.  Impossible to receive service even though we were sitting at bar.   Not at all relaxing and we were glad when it was time for dinner.  The food was very tasty at dinner but again the service was very disappointing.  Our wine was placed in a communal chiller but it proved impossible to get service to pour it.  Even when my husband requested that a glass be poured, he was advised that they would come back to do it.  Eventually we requested that it be left on the table.  When he asked for a pint he was advised barrel was being changed and they were sorry (again). Following dinner we went back to sugar loaf lounge and after about 15 mins we were able to order a drink.  The girl came with my drink advised my husband they were changing barrel (again? It was supposed to be only changed an hour previously). More apologies.  Then she knocked my drink all over the table.  Only a young girl who badly needs more training.  We gave up at that point and went to bed (11pm on my birthday!!).   Next morning went down to a beautiful breakfast but more apologies!  The host seated us at a table, when we came back from buffet someone else was sitting there.  The 2nd host had seated someone there.  At 11am, a staff member let himself into room, I greeted him at the door all apologies again said he thought room was vacant.  I am not the type of person who complains and would be fairly easy going but really the litany of service errors was incredible.  Definitely not 5 star service.",2,2014,08,16
217,Could be so so so much better,"This is the first time I have taken the time to write a review.

Myself, my wife and two children stayed at the Powerscourt hotel from 7th - 10th August. On arrival the reception staff were extremely friendly, professional and Robbie the concierge was excellent and went above and beyond 5 star service to make us and our eldest son feel welcome - thank you Robbie.

We were upgraded to one of the suites which was also extremely generous and well presented.

Whilst the hotel has many excellent qualities including the Sugarloaf lounge and surrounding views and spa facilities there are some basic requirements lacking that left a lasting impression....and not in a positive way:

- There were numerous juvenile staff working in the sugar loaf lounge who lacked basic training and to be honest experience at this level in terms of customer service and etiquette . Not knowing the difference between soup spoons and desert spoons and also simple things like not knowing what brown sauce was might sound petty however if you are pitching yourself towards the upper end of the market this is honestly not good enough. These are just a few of many examples.

Also if you are ever asked to go upstairs for breakfast if downstairs is full please decline and wait to be seated in the main restaurant. Our experience was honestly nothing short of faulty towers. In hindsight we have laughed at the amount of things that could go wrong in one sitting but on a serious note the staffing, the service and the management that morning nothing short of abysmal and totally incompetent. 
  
On booking we were also not made aware that the main bar was closed for 2 weeks due to repair and maintenance. this again was disappointing to note on arrival as with 2 kids we hoped to eat mainly in the bar as it would have been more relaxing.

There was also a children's play room. When we visited this it was clearly marked that this was unsupervised which to be honest was fine however the room clearly had not been cleaned in a couple of days.... possibly weeks. The room looked like it had been ramsacked with many of the items unplayable and old plates with food items sitting around the place. Certainly not child friendly...please visit Druids Glen to see how this should be done.

I don't mean to harp on however if  you are advertising 5 star and charging 5 star please live up to it. The general lack of maintenance around the place is starting to show however i appreciate the difficulties in the current climate of managing the ongoing costs of a facility of this stature.

I have no doubt and genuinely hope that this hotel gets some of these basic errors corrected because the location and hotel presents an amazing platform to deliver 5 star service in a beautiful part of the country.

In the interim or until I hear genuine first hand feedback that this is resolved if I wish to take my kids away I will opt for Druids Glen or if I want to go away for a weekend with my wife I will go to Solis Castle at Lough Eske - where we always leave with a positive memorable experience.",3,2014,08,15
217,"Amazing Location. Great rooms, but thats it really!!","The Positives
Amazing Location right beside Powerscourt Gardens. Driveway from main road and hotel grounds make you feel like Royalty. 
Rooms. Lovely big bed, Bathroom with nothing left out. Big bath, great shower with  2 types of shower head, 2 sinks and a TV inset into the mirror. All spotless and full credit to the house cleaning team. Computerised setting for aircon, lighting etc really makes you feel ""yes this must be 5*"".

The Negatives
We arrived at the hotel unaware that the main Bar was closed ""McGills"" for renovations during our stay. Check-in staff did not inform us of this and we were not the only guests disappointed. We were there for a 3-night stay, Sunday to Wednesday.

During our stay our group could only highlight 2 areas where staff seemed friendly, House cleaning staff always said hello and the tall concierge possibly Eastern European, had a sense of humour.  Other staff seemed either not interested in interacting with guests, very unhappy or perhaps they felt they could'nt. I am not saying that staff are rude or inpolite. They just lacked warmth. I have never experienced a hotel staff to be so clinical.
One Staff member went as far as to ask me if I had my car keys in an effort to remind me to tip him. I cant see any other reason why he would ask me that question but for me to feel change in my pocket. 
The price of drinks and meals is so crazy that this hotel helps the local village flourish by sending its guests elsewhere for food.
Nobody should be asked to pay €28 for a breakfast, €12 for 2 boiled eggs (when a hen that lays 240 eggs a year only costs €15) talk about mark up. If this hotel charged realistic prices I think they would hold on to a lot more guests for food and maybe create a bit more atmosphere.

Would I stay here again??? 
Yes, rooms are fab and clean. Spa beautifully designed, although patrons should be asked to wear swimming caps.  
As for dining I would continue to have my meals in the village in the Powerscourt Arms and Kennedys, Wicklow is full of great places to eat.",5,2014,08,15
217,A treat,"We decided to stay here as a treat.  Just off the ferry in Dublin and not wanting to do the drive south to Waterford in the dark.  It is in a lovely setting and an opulent hotel.  When we arrived we asked for a dinner reservation only to be told the first available was 9:45 which was far to late for us.  The hotel was busy due to the Dublin Horse Show.However, the helpful reception staff suggested an Italian restaurant in the village of Enniskerry and made us a reservation.  They also provided a car to and from the restaurant to avoid us having to drive the short distance.  Just a little too far to walk back.
Our room was very large and comfortable with great views of Sugarloaf Mountain (Wicklow not Rio).
Breakfast was great with lots on offer and they even made crispy bacon for us on request.
This was a treat but we were so pleased we stayed.",4,2014,08,14
217,Two weeks of bliss!!,"My mother and I stayed at the Powerscourt Hotel for a well needed 2 week respite. From the moment we arrived to the moment we left we were treated like princesses! The staff was caring and thoughtful. Always a smile on everyone's faces! If we had a question/concern it was addressed immediately with an answer and a smile. This is a hotel I will come back to just to catch up with all our new friends! Thank you Powerscourt! Thank you Robbie, Robyn, Jake, Zholt, Shane, Kim, Loaisa, Magdalena, Alex, Daniela, and George! We will miss all of you!",5,2014,08,12
217,disappointment,"I was surprised to encounter a male loitering on corridor outside my room door on morning of our departure. My daughter and baby had already gone towards the lift and I would have been some  minutes later leaving the room. This male held a walkie talkie and said ""hello"" to me as I exited my room. I felt he was openly checking on our time of departure; This obviously suspicious watching was extremely annoying. We had a nasty experience in McGills Pub restuarant in the hotel.on evening of 30th July. Having ordered vegetable curry with chicken my companion and I were served chicken curry only and no vegetables. Eventually we got the attention of staff member to this and pointed to what was ordered from menu. After 15 mins the staff member returned with a single portion of vegetables. We again requested  the second portion of vegetables. Another 15 minutes passed before she returned with vegetables. What a disaster. Did the chef refuse the vegetables as per menu and why the shabby delayed service?",3,2014,08,11
217,Stunning location,"We arrived on a Sunday afternoon looking for a relaxing, luxurious time. There you have it! This beautifully appointed hotel is nestled in the majestic surroundings of the Wicklow mountains and the amazing Powerscourt gardens. A light afternoon lunch in the foyer/bar area was perfect. The food was full of flavour from local produce. Our room was really spacious with a separate bathroom and dressing area.
The bed was very large and I have to say without a doubt was the most comfortable hotel bed I have ever slept in! Dinner at the Sika restaurant did not disappoint either. A wonderful menu to chose from with the added expertise of the very knowledgeable George to help with selection. Mouth watering scallops followed by perfectly cooked duck for me and the dessert?? A sublime chocolate bomb of sorts complete with liquid chocolate to pour over. A mention to the very pleasant Peter who was our server on the night.
Breakfast was served indoors or outdoors on the terrace as per your wish. A fantastic feast that was too. Eating alfresco with that beautiful backdrop is a must. A nice idea of having a coffee station just outside the restaurant in the morning to take away too.
Overall a wonderful location where you could quite easily pop down to the charming local village of Enniskerry....well that's if you could drag yourself away from sumptuous hotel to begin with! Will definitely return for a recharge of the batteries very soon.",5,2014,08,11
217,5* Luxury,"We stayed at the Powerscourt hotel for a weekend in August. It was not our first stay and the hotel had been sold since our last visit so was no longer the Ritz Carlton, however this made absolutely no difference.  The hotel was still kept to perfection with every staff member so impeccably dressed and incredibly helpful. It was obvious that the change of ownership was not going to have an impact on the excellent reputation of the hotel.  

We had a suite facing the mountains and it was beautiful. A very spacious living room, dining area and a fantastic bedroom with the most comfortable bed I think we have ever slept in.  We chose to eat breakfast in our room and were served like royalty with a breakfast you could not fault.  

We dined in the Sika restaurant for dinner on both nights, and the only thing we can say is .....fantastic! Every bit of both meals were just out of this world. The fact that the staff are so friendly and polite just makes the evening more wonderful.  

It is a 5* hotel with the rooms, the food, the staff and the general surroundings to justify every ounce of it's rating.  We have been before, we will definitely be back again and we highly recommend this hotel for a amazing relaxing weekend where you stay for 2 nights and come home feeling you were away for a week.  Absolutely fantastic, could find nothing to fault.",5,2014,08,11
217,Out of this world,Everything about Powerscourt was five star. Most relaxing break in a long time and I can't wait to return. Rooms were amazing with stunning views. Very relaxing pool area with loungers to sit. Whole break was wonderful. Recommend this hotel to everyone!,5,2014,08,10
217,Really luxurious bedroom suite,Had a great two night stay here. Room was beautiful and such a comfy bed. TV in bathroom was a lovely feature. Was disappointed that bar was closed for refurbishment - service in lounge was pretty slow. Had dinner in Sika restaurant and was excellent. Pool was great. Lunch and breakfast in lounge was very good too. ,5,2014,08,10
217,Idyllic and luxurious,"We stayed here for 4 days over a wonderfully sunny July weekend for a wedding and had the pleasure of staying in a large suite with a view toward the Sugarloaf Mountain. The hotel is set within a beautiful estate in a lovely part of Wicklow. The hotel itself is unashamedly luxurious with enough gilding, wood panelling and crystal to satisfy anyone, the staff are also incredibly courteous, friendly and helpful. 

Our room was magnificent, a large corner suite with a large private terrace, with sunloungers and seating, accessed from the bedroom and overlooking the hotel grounds with views toward the Wicklow countryside. The suite was well appointed with a guest bathroom, living room, study and dining areas as well as a large dressing room, bedroom and master bathroom. Most importantly, the room was spotless and well maintained. 

Breakfast was absolutely fine with plenty of choice available to suit most tastes and needs. Unfortunately I did get the chance to try the Sugarloaf Lounge but I did try the food in McGills and it was very nice indeed, it's also a great place to spend the night having a few drinks with friends. 

I was at the hotel to attend a wedding and in regard to the food and service from the staff it was simply fantastic. They all contributed to a great day.

If you are staying at the hotel then you simply must also take a walk up to Powerscourt House and enjoy the expansive and beautiful gardens there.

I'll definitely be back and very much looking forward to a return visit.",5,2014,08,10
217,Excellent hotel and grounds,"When we stayed at the Powerscourt Hotel, it was part of The Ritz-Carlton group. I understand it was going to change hands shortly following our stay but word has it the hotel management is still top notch, just like it was when it was a Ritz property. 

The room was very very nice; spacious, comfortable and clean. It had a wonderful view of the grounds, too. The bathroom was excellent. Loved the shower!

We ate in the bar, spent time in the spa (the dry sauna and pool). All facilities were clean and well-maintained. The staff was pleasant and helpful wherever we were in the hotel. We thoroughly enjoyed our two night stay at Powerscourt. We would love to stay there again.",5,2014,08,08
217,Beware - McGills closed for renovation,"We arrived at Powerscourt today and were very much looking forward to 3 days relaxing after a busy 5 days already in Ireland.  Part of the appeal of the Powerscourt is that everything is onsite - gardens to explore, a gym/pool/spa/fitness center, a couple of dining options and an authentic Irish pub, McGills.  Imagine our dismay when we learned upon check in that they just closed McGills for renovation.  Not only was I not informed in advance, the check in clerk told me it's on the website as if I should have known (and as if I was checking the website daily while on vacation).  And by the way - as of this post there is no mention on the website.

As we are a family traveling with 3 young daughters, I had already splurged and upgraded to a suite.  There was no welcome for the kids, no one that helped with our bags when we arrived - no 5 star treatment at all, I'm afraid, for a hotel that advertises itself as such.  

The room is spacious and big, but a bit worn down - towels look very worn, sheer drapes have stains, etc.  The room only had 3 large towels.  There are no coffee making facilities in the room.

Our desire to stay onsite and not have to go out for every meal/drink has now been dashed with the temporary closing of McGills.  The concierge kindly offered to pay for a cab to/from another local family-friendly pub... but again, that defeats the objective.  And we did not receive a discounted rate as a result of the work, though I think they knew in advance they were planning to renovate McGills.

So overall, my review is very mixed.  We'll see what the next 2 days bring.",3,2014,08,07
217,Relaxed luxury,"This is a gorgeous spot to stay for a luxury night or two away from ordinary life. I've stayed here when it was the Ritz Carlton and more recently after the changeover and am happy to note that standards haven't fallen.
What's great about this place is the fact the staff aren't remotely snooty. This means you instantly feel at home and relax.
Rooms are lovely. Suites are gorgeous. The bar is welcoming, though a cup of coffee is overly expensive. The pool area is fabulous, low lighting, quiet...l wish l was there now!
Breakfast is the highlight. Do not order to your room as you'll miss out on the fabulous goodies spread gloriously around the breakfast room.
As soon as l can get a babysitter l am going back!",5,2014,08,06
217,Excellent start to our holiday,"A night at the Powerscourt certainly added the sparkle of luxury you want at the start of a holiday. Go in the pool when the lights are subdued and you feel as if you are swimming through Guinness. The water appears black and the ""head"" is golden. The afternoon tea is to be recommended and certainly is enough to be a meal. The fancy bathrooms with TV integrated into the mirror were a delight in our suite.",5,2014,08,06
217,"Lovely hotel, but knows how to charge","Stayed here July 2014.  We had a very pleasant stay, and enjoyed the experience.  But I suppose we weren't ""in the mood"" for the high cost of a lot of the sundries.

We had been given a voucher for the hotel, but had to cover some of the cost of staying ourselves. On considering the room rates, we went for a room only rate, as breakfast was a significant additional cost that I felt uncomfortable about paying (if you pay a fortune for breakfast you end up just trying to get your value out of it by eating way more than you want or need and also there is only so much in good conscience one can spend on breakfast).

Our room was beautiful, the bathroom was fantastic, and there was lots of room.  The complimentary wi-fi was great.  The bed was super big and really comfortable.  The windows could have done with a big clean though, genuinely were very dirty.  Furthermore, the coffee/tea making facilities were very limited.  Recently I have stayed in a Clarion, a Mercure and other hotels (ostensibly not of the standard of Powerscourt) that have nespresso machines.  But here we only had soluble instant coffee.  My suggestion would be to give a good quality (n)espresso machine in the rooms.

The swimming pool is lovely, though be aware that there are particular hours for children's swimming time.  Totally fair enough that there is kids' swimming time, but if you want it to be very quiet by the pool you might have to choose your time for going down there wisely.

We ate in the ""pub"" downstairs and the food was of good quality.  However, drinks prices (e.g. €4 for a 7up, €6 for a pint, coffee was something like €4 or €4.50) were irksome and I suppose we weren't trying to splurge for the evening, just have a simple enough meal, and it was annoying to pay a lot more for a standard product (e.g. 7up or Harp) than you would pay elsewhere.  Further, a bottle of wine (new world) started at €35, for example.

Staff were lovely though and very pleasant and professional.  Would totally recommend staying here but be prepared to have deep pockets!",4,2014,08,05
217,A touch of class,"A special night of luxury and decadence.  From the moment we arrived, despite the fact that we don’t wear Gucci or carry Chanel bags we were made to feel like royalty.  A down to earth and professional reception team seem to go that extra mile to make you feel welcome from the minute you arrive.  The incredible location and views from the hotel certainly add to its beauty but also make you feel like you could be just about anywhere in the world despite being only a stones throw away from the city.  Our daughter squealed with delight when afternoon tea arrived, everything not only looked so beautiful but was delicious.  Getting to pick from all the little sweet treats simply added to our happiness.   They even have the most exquisite tea bags, we got to choose from just about every imaginable flavour, something rare and as our seven year old proclaimed everything seemed to taste nicer from such a pretty tea cup.   We lounged in our room following afternoon tea and what a beautiful room/suite it was.   Right from the get go we were clambering to each have a bath just so we could watch the telly in the bathroom, with his and hers wash hand basins and a walk in wardrobe nearly as big as my bedroom, I thought I could definitely get used to this.  We ventured down to the games room which had toys a plenty which are open to all guests for children of all ages.    The Powerscourt Hotel and its grounds are certainly worthy of a few days of exploration in themselves, we could have spent days wandering outside but alas with bellies beckoning we returned to our room to get ready for dinner.    We entered the simple and elegant dining room with stunning views and again were met with such a sense of warmth, made to feel so welcome, unobtrusive, professional staff made the night complete.  The food ticked every box, the highlight had to be our little one getting to pour chocolate sauce over her dads dessert to discover that beneath the chocolate sphere lay a masterpiece in pastry.  My lemon tart was simply the best I have tasted.  After dinner we headed to the atmospheric Irish bar within the hotel which felt much more like a bar and less like a hotel than most.  Again a really lovely bartender took the time to chat to us.  There is so much to say about why the Powerscourt Hotel is such an incredible spot, the location, the rooms, the bar, the restaurant, the food, the childrens amenities, the pool (which is exceptional) but I feel what really makes it is their staff.   Without meaning to sound naff everyone there seemed to be happy to work there, it’s got such a warm feeling about it and then came the SPA.  After an aromatherapy massage and facial there was only one thing left to do the next day, float out the door and start planning our next trip…..",5,2014,08,05
217,AMAZING..luxury & class! Expensive but worth it for a treat!,"Powerscourt Autograph Hotel is not cheap but then when you go there and experience what it offers, you cant really complain! Admittedly we were in a suite - a complimentary upgrade which was delightful - but the level of comfort, style and pure class is really among the best you will find in Ireland. Having stayed in several 5 star hotels before - as we don't fly except when unavoidable -  this really was the BEST we have been to. From the TV in the bathroom mirror...to the beautiful view to the cleanliness of the place - it really ticks all the boxes. So yes it is expensive but if its a treat and pure luxury you are after ...then do not hesitate and book today!",5,2014,08,03
217,"Former Glory Gone, Gone, Gone","I didn't stay here, but I can't find the restaurant to review where I had lunch.  Nevertheless, a girlfriend and I had a good look around this hotel.  I was shocked.  There is clearly a cost-cutting exercise going on, and it is so evident.  Neglect is obvious, weeds are growing all over the paths, there are broken flagstones and ashtrays full of rubbish.  
Shame, as on approach the facade looks impressive.  Such a lovely location too.  Maybe the Celtic Tiger simply can't warrant the upkeep given the low numbers - the carpark was virtually empty the day we visited.  I imagine it was built when Ireland was in its heyday, let's hope it returns",2,2014,08,01
217,The grand finale to our 5 star resort tour of Ireland.,The Powerscourt Hotel was the last hotel in our 10 day tour of Ireland.  We stayed in three other five star hotels this trip and the Powerscourt was definitely the grand finale of our trip.  The staff was wonderful and courteous.  We had a problem with the room being very warm and the staff and manager made attempts to remedy it.  Although the unit in our room was not working properly they did bring us some fans and a portable air unit.  If I had been staying for more than two days I would have asked to be switched to another room but my sister and her husband was traveling with us and they were in the room next to us so we just stayed in the room we had.  The reception guy did pay for our breakfast upon check out due to the problems with the air conditioning.  I thought this hotel was just beautiful.  The room and the grounds were gorgeous.  They shuttled us into the village for dinner and shopping at no charge.  Jake the Concierge was very friendly and helpful with things to do.  I absolutely recommend this hotel.,5,2014,07,31
217,Very nice hotel just outside Dublin,"We resently stayed 1 night visiting the Wicklow mountains. We had a beautifull, very large and very luxurieus bedroom with a beautifull view on the mountain. Breakfast was also very good. The pool and the haman was great. I would defenitily stay here again. I was sorry I booked another hotel in Dublin for our visit to the town, because  I would much rather have stayed here and drive the 20 km into town.
Two minor points. Because we were traveling with our son, the two double beds were to small. The garden around the hotel could do with some weeding.",5,2014,07,30
217,Amazing haven to totally relax in!,"Such a beautiful hotel in beautiful surroundings.A drive through the picturesque village of Enniskerry and on through the tree lined avenue to Powerscourt House and Gardens,This hotel is nestled in among the greenery. It has a huge spacious lobby,with a view of the Wicklow mountains at the back.Here you can have afternoon tea or other light meals and drinks,while making the most of the view.Check in was quick and the staff were extremely helpful and polite.All the staff throughout our stay were very friendly without being imposing.
We had booked a one bedroom suite and I had requested one with a balcony.The room (number 621) was amazing! A gorgeous corner room on the 6th floor,with a balcony that went the whole way around.The room was spotlessly clean.It was like a mini apartment with living area with writing desk,dining area,dressing room,2 bathrooms (one with a TV built into the mirror) and a bedroom with a huge bed which was very comfortable.There was also a well stocked (but expensive) mini bar and tea/coffee making facilities.The floor to ceiling windows the whole way around the room,made sure it was bright and airy. The lights,heating and curtains were all controlled by a touch panel and the decor was luxurious.The only issues wit the rooms was the lack of toiletries in the bathrooms and a very short supply of tea/coffee.In a hotel of this standard,it isn`t a lot to ask and would make for a nice touch.Not a huge deal though.
We had dinner in the bar in the evening.The bar is cosy and welcoming,again with friendly staff.The food was reasonably priced and well presented.The drinks however were expensive. There was only one type of cocktail available which came in a small glass and cost 15eur!!! This was the same price as my main course! We had burgers which were well cooked and nicely seasoned,along with delicious fries and salad. A glass of red wine and a beer added another 18eur to the bill. 
Breakfast was served in the Sika restaurant.As it was a beautiful day,tables were available outside on the terrace.We opted for this as the scenery is outstanding. Breakfast was a wonderful buffet with a wide range of choice. From the traditional ""fry"",cereals,fruit and yoghurts to the wide selection of breads,pasteries,cheeses,fish,crepes and waffles (with an amazing chocolate sauce and whipped cream),there was something for all tastes. Other items,such as omelettes,were available to order. Tea,coffee and toast were brought to your table.
The scenery around the hotel is beautiful and there is a children's play park. A short walk up the avenue brings you to Powerscourt house and Gardens.The gardens are  beautiful as is the house. There is a nice coffee shop inside and an Avoca Handweavers store. 
The hotel has its own gardens however but they were poorly maintained which was disappointing. We decided to take a walk after dinner but had to give up.This was due to overgrown plants and uneven paths which wasn`t helped by the obvious lack of lighting. You can see the lights along the paths but they no longer actually light up. The water fountain at the rear of the hotel isn`t lit at night either. These are small things which would make a huge improvement and the gardens just cry neglect.Such a nice hotel would benefit from having these gardens maintained well. Bicycle hire is free for guests too but we didn't use this.
We used the Spa before leaving.It is impressive but I was also slightly disappointed here too. The pool is amazing but cold.Wet towels were lying about the loungers and there was a jacuzzi pool which wasn`t all that warm either. The ambience is nice though. The Hammam was spacious but needed cleaned as there was used towels all over the floor.Changing rooms were nice and also warm but the showers gels etc were empty. Again,some attention to detail here would be beneficial. The spa was complimentary for guests but the thermal suite wasn`t. It was an extra 25eur to use.We didn`t bother as I think the hotel is expensive enough for an overnight stay.
All in all we had a brilliant stay in gorgeous surroundings and the most comfortable bed ever! :) We would definitely return here as a treat but would like to see a few improvements made in the above areas and maybe a more comprehensive cocktail list.",4,2014,07,29
217,This is definitely not a Ritz!,"On its face, this is a beautiful hotel in a beautiful location. I had been told that until recently this hotel was a Ritz.  Now it is part of the Marriott Autography collection - independently owned upscale hotels.  On arrival, we were treated by wonderful bellman.  Front desk graciously informed me that I would be upgraded due to my Marriott elite status...which we appreciated.   However, as a frequent visitor to Ritz hotels, I soon realized that something was off.  It looked as if furniture was actually missing from our room.   Went into bathroom and there were not typical amenities.  The robes and towels were tattered and worn.  We went to grab a late lunch but the casual dining pub was not open.  No place to sit in lobby area that had 3 sofa areas that were full.   We went to sit out side and enjoy the view...only to find 3 wooden picnic tables!  No chairs, no outdoor furniture.   So, we decided to walk the gardens. Unfortunately, whoever bought the hotel has decided not to spend any money on the former gardens - they are overgrown, full of weeds, and totally neglected...so sad.  Walkways through them were covered with moss.  Saw other aspects of hotel are not being maintained to what you would expect for the price.
Bottom line, do not expect a Ritz experience in coming here and be cautious as many facility and room aspects seem to be neglected.",3,2014,07,27
217,Take a breake and relax,"This place a bit outside of Dublin city its a little heaven on the earth!
Wonderful,helpful staff,modern and beautiful rooms. The indoor pool and spa it is what you need after hard week. The restaurant and Sugar loaf launch will treat you with a great breakfast in the morning and afternoon and evening menu is amassing.
Beautiful surroundings its is another story of your fairy tail...wish to all go there and enjoy.",5,2014,07,23
217,Definitely 5 stars!,"From the moment we arrived the entire experience with this hotel was wonderful. The hotel staff were helpful and friendly assisting us with our bags, showing us the hotel, helping with directions, mailing postcards for us, and so much more.  The room was amazing.  Everything was clean. The bathroom had two sinks, tub, separate shower, and a toilet with a privacy door.  We had a two bedroom suite with a separate sitting room.  The beds were comfortable with plenty of pillows. There was a lot of space to feel comfortable and not at all crowded.  The closet was a small room itself, with a closet full of drawers and more to hang clothes, with enough room to easily change clothes inside the room.  The restaurant was great, and I have to say the breakfast was the best I've ever had at a hotel!   I would absolutely recommend this hotel!",5,2014,07,23
217,"Beautiful location, people and service","This is something of a treat. Nestled away on the Powerscourt Estate, this is a truly charming location. The hotel is imposing from the outside, but actually much more appealing from the inside.

We had a 'larger' room - which as actually a superb suite - with hallway, lounge and large sleeping area. The marble bathroom was well appointed, spotless and very stylish. Three huge windows and on the 5th floor, no one overlooking you from any angle. Wonderful to have curtains and nets fully open to admire the amazing scenery.

Great bedding - a reliably good Marriott experience no matter where you seem to go or which 'level' of their Brand you stay at. The only slight surpass was that we didn't seem to get a turndown service, which matters not but seems odd at this level of hotel.

Service was charming and welcoming, and nearly always with a smile.

Breakfast we took 'upstairs' in the lounge area and this offers the gorgeous vista over the treat and towards Sugar Loaf mountain.

Staff will gladly explain the various walking routes around the estate, and they're quite spectacular - you'd be mad to come here and not make something of the local area. Powerscourt house and gardens are on your doorstep and well worth visiting - a few minutes walk along the road. The gardens are apparently ranked No 3 in the world...

The Spa was very good. For once a decent massage and not a 'bit of a rub'. I'm no spa expert, but it worked for me, and my back...

Dinner we did two different ways - one night in the 'pub' int he hotel - good atmosphere but be warned not a lot of places to sit so tricky if you're eating. Arrive early. Bar food was good although nothing particularly special. The Guiness was however perfect, and as ever, seems to be best served in Eire...

Dinner at the Sika restaurant was first class. Five star dining, relaxed yet sumptuous restaurant setting and again gorgeous views. The only small point was that the hotel does need to clean the windows daily - if they wanted a Michelin star, they'd be knocked down for this. It's trivial of course, but why not go that extra mile for perfection, given everything else?

Another tiny point - the splendid vista is slightly tainted by a very drab 'fire assembly point' - I'm sure something could be done to make it look a bit better.

We'd definitely stay again. If this makes sense - it's an unusual but welcome 'mix' of Five Star and relaxing.",5,2014,07,20
217,No longer a 5 star experience,"Having previously stayed at this hotel when it was the Ritz- I had high expectations as my last stay here was one of the best hotel experiences I ever had. The setting is still beautiful but it now feels like a completely different hotel. Standards have definitely slipped since the hotel has changed hands.

On arrival we were told our room wasnt ready, which was fine, as we arrived a little before the 3pm check in. The receptionist said we would receive a call when our room was ready. We went  down to the bar to wait only to find that it was closed- i found it a bit strange that in the height of summer, with the hotel fully booked (as receptionist informed us) that the bar doesn't open until 3pm. The lounge area was full so we couldn't sit there and wait, so we went for a walk around the grounds, the gardens are not as well tended as before and there is an overall feeling of grubbiness and deterioration around the hotel and grounds, which is a bit sad. 

At 3.15pm we came back and again asked if room was ready. We were told that the final checks were being carried out on the rooms and would only be a few minutes longer and again we would receive a call when room was ready. 
We went down to the bar, which had since opened and ordered 2 drinks (€21 for 2 gin and tonics- the days of the Ritz may be gone but they retained the prices). Still no phone call. We finished the drinks and went back up to reception. By now it was 4.15pm, On arriving at reception we were told that the room was indeed ready and had been for quite some time. No apology for making us wait over an hour to check in, a shrug of the shoulders for the fact that noone contacted us to let us know. The staff couldn't care less. It was not a good first impression.

The rooms look the same but could do with some updating and lack the nice little touches of the Ritz. The directories in the room were grubby and the bathrobe was dirty. The room, which was non smoking, had cigarette butts stuck in the window panels.

The restaurant was fully booked so we ate dinner in the lounge area. Dinner was ok, fish was overcooked but thankfully the service was excellent. Our waitress and the woman who was possibly the lounge manager were wonderful and the only good part of a very very average hotel stay. 

 I would no longer recommend staying here. It was definitely not a 5 star experience and not a patch on the service previously received at this hotel.",3,2014,07,20
217,Needs a complete overhaul,"This has the potential to be a good hotel, but as it stands there are too many weaknesses to warrant it having 5 stars.  The approach to the hotel is impressive as one continues along a long drive between gardens and trees.  However, as the hotel comes in to sight it is not remarkable; it is a strange mishmash of car park, lighting and modern structures.  On check in there was considerable confusion and disruption.  We had booked two rooms for my husband and me and our children and had asked for adjacent rooms on a high floor.  However, that is not what we had been given and the rooms were not even on the same floor.  The plus side was that we had been given an upgrade.  Various changes were made and eventually the chap on reception found us two rooms on the same floor and told me that the room for my husband and myself was stunning.  Excellent!  My daughters' room was very close to the noisy lounge, about which I was a little concerned but as we were only staying 2 nights I thought we could live with it.  We then made our way to the other room and were excited on entering a fabulous suite - we went into the living room area exclaiming enthusiastically about the accommodation and then I walked towards the bedroom area to see a chap lying on the bed.  Horror!  We made a very hasty exit and it was back down to reception.  We then had another lengthy wait while another room was found for us and our daughters.  From arriving in reception and eventually getting into the rooms in which we stayed must have taken almost an hour.  

Both rooms were of a good size and were clean.  However, too many niggles occurred.  The rooms either side of us had balcony furniture but ours didn't.  We did not receive a newspaper in the mornings although other people did.  There was no turn down service and no water provided the first night nor indeed either night for our daughters. On the first full day neither of our rooms had been serviced by 2.30 and I had to contact housekeeping who told me it could be up to 4.30pm. I agree very much with ML of London who highlighted a number of weaknesses including the ineffective control panel which really is not necessary to turn lights on and off.  Another issue ML raised was the lack of public areas for the size of the hotel.  The lounge area was full of people having afternoon tea when we arrived and we tried to eat there the first evening but most tables were reserved and we were shown to the bar area by a rather surly member of staff who then ignored us.  Through a lack of alternatives we reluctantly went down to the dark, soulless bar which seemed to be full of children who were not properly supervised (a common element throughout the hotel) and ate a very overpriced and unremarkable meal.  My steak was poor (chewy and gristly) but the chips were very good (seemed homemade).  However, 6 euros for a bottle of water was pushing it.  The following night we went to Emilia's Italian restaurant in Enniskerry and had excellent pizzas and good service.

The food at breakfast was good but on the first morning it was like eating in a creche; there were several tables with children on them, which is fine, but a number of the children were extremely noisy and the parents seemed quite unconcerned.  The staff were pleasant enough but the whole breakfast experience did not reflect a supposed 5 stars.

The outside area of the hotel really is a dog's dinner.  The back of the hotel (with the views and the other side to the car park) really needs taking in hand.  There is a big area of grass with a couple of tatty looking picnic tables, a chess set which adds nothing really, a children's playground area and then a large area of concrete, the purpose of which is unclear.  The 3 or 4 large metal pieces of 'art' were incongruous and an eyesore. There were no flowers or flower beds, no interesting greenery, and only a small outdoor seating area which was not used when we were there.  The first night of our stay was warm and sunny and yet we had found ourselves sitting in the dark, rather grim 'Irish bar' when it would have been nice to sit outside enjoying the summer evening.

Incidentally, 1,000 euros was debited from my husband's card when we checked in although we were not told this at the time.  Most hotels swipe a card but to take 1,000 euros without even telling us smacks of sharp practice.

There were a large number of families when we were there which is fine but a significant number of children seemed to be free-range which does not make for a relaxing experience.

The hotel is within a 30 minute drive of Dun Laoghaire which was handy for the ferry but I would rather have returned to the Four Seasons in Dublin.  This particular hotel needs a complete overhaul if it is to justify its 5 stars, otherwise they should drop prices and market themselves as a 4 star.",3,2014,07,20
217,The spirit has gone...,"I have stayed many times at this hotel over the last years. The setting is amazing and the hotel simply beautiful. Or at least was... Over the years, I was able to witness the devastating cost cutting operations which lead to an overall deterioration of the building and the rooms. The days of Ritz Carlton are gone... And some of the key staff as well. The hotel seems to have lost its soul. Staff is doing its best to keep the place up but without major investment in maintenance and human resources, this place will simply vanish more over time. What a shame ! The only thing that remains exceptional and actually improved is the restaurant. With the Gordon Ramsay franchise gone, Chef Peter Byrne can now fully express his creativity and love for local products. I just hope this young talented Chef will not get bored by the place as he his, in my humble opinion, the main purpose of staying at this hotel.",3,2014,07,19
217,Ireland,"We stayed at the Powerscourt hotel last summer for just over 36 hours.  It was fabulous! We were flying out of Dublin so with the hotel being just 30 minutes or so from the airport we decided to stay there. In that short amount of time we were able to enjoy a high tea, hike to the falls, walk through the famous gardens and also have a wonderful spa treatment. Our dinner the last night was truly a treat. The entire hotel is beautiful and beautifully maintained. Would love to spend more time there. I would highly recommend staying here.",5,2014,07,19
217,5 stars isn't enough!,"unfortunately, because of being a  bit pricy (not their fault...such is life), not many people in their lives will experience this wonderful hotel..if you have a chance to be here, you would love everything...Once, a hotel manager told me that they as employees have to do everything ""possible to make it happen"" and even then, there will be a small percentage of unsatisfied customer...well, those are the miserable ones who will never be happy...
If you happen to complain about this resort...you clearly are the problem and will never be happy in this world!

 Now,  we could talk about the grounds, very well kept, the super elegant rooms so modern and so classic at the same time. Perhaps the tea time in the afternoon always so perfect for the Irish weather!!  How about the spa? so relaxing and beautiful... ahhh the spa, something you can find in those elegant resorts in florida.....but what make this hotel a dream come true is actually their customer service...there is a saying in old Rome stating that ""people with a full stomach never complain"". It really looks like the employees are happy here, front desk runs flawlessly. Always there with a smile..the restaurant downstairs, which has a killer buffet in the morning (Thank you Dario for making it extra special...for us)just perfect in any way.So many people and all of them always welcoming...(real, not a forced smile)... someone is doing a great job in keeping them happy.
By the way, the hotel is situated in a spectacular spot..I am sure you are already doing the ""usual homework""..go ahead ""make your day"" and enjoy the place!!!",5,2014,07,19
217,What a lovely hotel,I can honestly not fault the hotel. It is in a wonderful setting and the building itself is magnificent. The staff really did go that extra mile. eg milk for my daughter was given free of charge even when I asked to pay. It’s a small thing but you forget to bring these things with you and certain places would charge you for these. Breakfast was so nice each morning; it’s a grand buffet and has everything you could want and more. The fruit was fresh and a chef kept it stocked up all the time. The room was amazing and I think the view of the Sugar Loaf Mnts is beautiful. Thanks you for a great few days away from reality. Well Done,5,2014,07,18
217,New owners have the touch,"Stayed here for a wedding recently - rooms were amazing (but they always were) big difference is the service - it has improved two fold. 

Staff were extremely friendly - food was excellent including having breakfast out on the terrace. 

New branding is more in line with the surroundings. 

Looking forward to going back soon as its so near to Dublin. 

P.s Golf was amazing too!!",5,2014,07,17
217,great service,"made feel welcome from moment we arrived in reception, room fab and view even better, had spa treatments spa staff lovely only thing i didn't like was the seperate spa areas for men and women, i went with my husband so  didn't want to saparate. had dinner that night very nice, couldn't fault it and they sent down an extra plate of macaroons for my husbands birthday, nice touch. bed fab breakfast to die for!!!",4,2014,07,16
217,Average,"Disappointed. Hotel lacks soul. Was so looking forward to the break. Room not available on check in at 4pm. Told to wait and they would phone us. Hotel does not exploit the view  - seems back to front. 
On the positive side of things - our room was beautiful. Very clean and extremely comfortable. 
Food in restaurant was good but again the restaurant lacked atmosphere - again view not exploited - obscured by net curtains. Sorry but would not recommend. ",3,2014,07,15
217,Wonderful staff..great location,Just back from our stay at this hotel and we had a great welcome from the receptionist on arrival. The room was immaculate with a view of the mountain. Sika restaurant food was very good although the chocolate sphere was bitter and although the waiter poured hot chocolate over to melt it...it didn't improve the taste! Breakfast was a great experience and staff were very helpful. The Espa was amazing and the pool excellent. I would recommend this hotel and hope to return with friends very soon. Was surprised to learn the hotel was only seven years old...had a feeling it had been there a long time as it fitted into the area so well. ,5,2014,07,14
217,Wonderful resort on beautiful grounds,First class resort on beautiful grounds. The rooms are beautiful with all updated amenities. The beds are super comfortable and state of the art electronics. We spent a lot of time in the adjacent gardens which are fabulous. We enjoyed dining and tea at the gardens restaurant on the outside dining area. Don't miss the soft serve ice cream to the right of the entrance courtyard.,5,2014,07,12
217,"Almost outstanding, but just a few slips","Being a loyal Marriott guest (over 1000 nights) I had high expectations for our stay and they were nearly achieved.  The hotel itself is stunning and the views from the lounge are pretty special … we stayed two nights and spent both evenings having pre-dinner drinks overlooking Sugar-Loaf mountain.  Service in the lounge was excellent.  We had dinner the pub one evening and an early dinner in the lounge the second evening … both were great dining experiences.  McGill's pub was quite busy but service was good and the atmosphere very 'Irish'.

Breakfast was a little less well organised.  We had to ask for tea twice both days.  The staff seemed very stretched.  However, the buffet food was very good and the eggs cooked to order promptly.

One thing not to miss is the walk through the private estate.  It was very tranquil and there was a stunning display of rhododendrons.  You can get a map from reception.

Just a couple of niggles.  I have been a Platinum Elite guest for many years and was surprised that the lady on reception did not pick up on this.  Also, the Marriott Rewards points allocated for our stay were significantly lower than expected.  These have now been resolved but it is a little irritating.

Overall, the room was excellent and very comfortable … as usual for Marriott … and the majority of our stay was excellent.  We would definitely return.",4,2014,07,10
217,Romantic Getaway,"The perfect place for a romantic weekend away.  Stunning location, beautiful rooms, fabulous food (and cocktails), friendly staff.  We had a 6th floor room with balcony.  Can't wait to go back.

Tip: If you are looking to venture out of the hotel for food try The Grange Kitchen or Byrne and Woods in Roundwood.",5,2014,07,10
217,They Dropped the Ritz-Carlton Name But Not the Ritz-Carlton Quality,"I spent a few nights at the Powerscourt Hotel, which was not long ago the Ritz-Carlton.  I must say that it felt like a Ritz-Carlton with the kind of service quality and attention to detail.
Room was great - classically luxurious with modern amenities.  I love the electricity converter that provides travelers with 110v power outlets.  Food was excellent.  The View of Sugarloaf Mountain was very soothing.  There are bicycles to borrow and a ride around the Powerscourt is an experience of lifetime.  The only thing I am not really too excited about is the location.  It's quite a way from Dublin and the roads from major highway is so narrow they make your hair stand on end!  There are also lots of tour groups at the hotel, quite unusual for a (former) Ritz-Carlton too.
While stay at the Powerscourt Hotel, do visit the Johnny Fox Pub - it's a world-famous Irish Pub not far from the hotel.  You'll not regret.",4,2014,07,09
217,Luxurious Treat,"We arrived at are our room and were astounded with the fantastic superior suite we had been upgraded to. Upon opening the door, you have a beautiful hallway leading into a stunning dining/sitting room with beautiful furniture and a full kitchen. We also discovered a guest toilet. Then we entered the bedroom where there was a huge bed, which was the most comfortable bed I have ever stayed on. We had huge wardrobes, which then lead to a gorgeous bathroom, with walk in shower, bath and separate toilet. There was even a tv built into the mirror!!!! We also had a huge balcony with table and chairs and sun beds, overlooking the gardens. Accommodation could not be faulted and top marks to the cleaning staff. Unfortunately the breakfast wasn't the best. It was a buffet/hot meal, however I felt that much of it had been left for a while, so was not fresh each morning. Usually in a hotel, there is constant refilling and new foods being put out. On the first morning, there was about 2 fried eggs left which looked as if they had been there for hours, then when new ones were brought out, they weren't much better. I was very happy that we had our meal included as I certainly would not have paid 29euro for this. I also felt the staff in McGills pub were very inexperienced and maybe a training course in bar customer service and drink preparing wouldn't go astray. We didn't get to the pool, but then the rule of having to wear your dressing gown instead of clothes to it can make quite a few people uncomfortable. Aside from those few items, we had a wonderful stay and could not fault the hotels accommodation.",5,2014,07,08
217,One of the best hotels ever…seriously.,"I can't say enough about this place.   I have traveled for the last 25 years and this would rank as one of the most wonderful hotels I have ever stayed at.   The rooms were fantastically large and very well appointed.   The bathrooms were perfect and huge with everything you need.   My only complaint was the ironing board was broken!  I didn't want to leave and if my wife was with me I would have had to drag her out of there.   The grounds are quiet and peaceful and expansive and even have a life size chess set in the garden area.   The service was very professional, helpful and attentive at all times.   The restaurant was equally incredible and one of the best meals I have had in a very long time.  (Irish Steak).   Service there was out of this world also. This is without a doubt a place I will return with my wife and I would highly recommend this place for a couples get away.   You might just get lucky!! :-)   Seriously though, this hotel deserves a golf clap.",5,2014,07,08
217,Secretly downgrade your reservation for Marriott Gold Elite Member,"As a Marriot Gold Elite member, I was expected to be upgraded. However upon checking in, instead of upgrade, I was DOWNGRADED secretly. (Change to lower grade room without telling you). 
I booked my reservation July, 2013 when the property was still Ritz Carlton. My reservation is Sugar Loaf Mountain view. When check in, they assigned me to room 408 which is the room right next to the noisy restaurant with NO mountain view. I did not realize until later due to the jet lag (too tired to investigate). later of the day, when I checked again my on-line booking, it was DOWNGRADED from Mountain View to resort view. Good thing I still keep my original reservation detail to proof it is not the same. 
I understand if the room is not available on the date, they should kindly inform the customer at check-in instead of secretly altered the reservation and wish the customer won’t catch it. This is not ethic action at all, especially I expect Ritz Carlton service quality standard 
I did bring up the issues to the night front desk manager. He apologized and promised will put us in the right room next days since it was fully booked on the day. He also offered the dinner next day to compensate the mistake made by the hotel. I was happy with the result and thought it was settled. Next days when we are backed from the city excursion, our new room was ready. However the other front desk manager lady refused to honor the offer. She said there is no need to compensate since we already give you the right room. It is very rude and we felt totally insulted.",2,2014,07,07
217,Wonderful hotel,"I stayed here last Saturday the 5th of July and I wish I was still there. 

We arrived at the hotel at approximately 2.40pm. The drive alone up to the hotel gets you in a great mood to start your holiday. 

We were greeted by a lovely lady on reception who took our voucher and proceeded to check us in. We were informed our room was not ready but that it would be ready shortly as checkin is not till 3pm. We did not mind as part of our package was afternoon tea so we went to the Sugar Loaf lounge where our table was reserved in the window and we had breathtaking views to accompany our tea. 

We ordered the afternoon tea and the presentation was wonderful from the china cups to the glass resting dish for your teabag nothing was left out. The food itself was lovely. We finished what was on the trays and then the waitress brought over their dessert trolley and we got to choose 2 desserts each. I opted for a lemon tart and a chocolate brownie and I was impressed by both. 
I got a glass of Pinot Grigio which was lovely. When we finished we asked for the bill to pay for the wine and leave a tip. On both booking and being seated we informed the staff that the tea was part of our package but when we got the bill there was a €70 charge for the two afternoon teas. My husband went up to a staff member and explained but it took them almost 15 minutes to sort out. At 3.15pm, during our tea, reception had phoned to say our room was ready.  I left my husband to sort out the bill as I went for the room keys. When I came back to him he was still waiting on the bill to be sorted but as I wanted to freshen up before my massage I went ahead to the room. 

When I got to our room all I could do was text my husband - WOW!! Our room was well beyond anything I could have hoped for. 

As I entered on the right hand side was a toilet, storage wardrobes and straight ahead was a beautiful classic sitting room. There was a small corridor to the left which opened up into a huge room complete with Kingsize bed. 

There was a control box by the bed to operate the lights, air con, do not disturb notice and an icon to open/close the curtains. 

Then off the bedroom was the main bathroom which had a lovely bath, separate shower room and separate toilet. The best part for me was the television actually in the mirror. 

The bed was amazingly comfortable I did not want to leave it but we had massages booked so I quickly showered and went to the spa. 

As soon as you enter the spa area you can feel the calmness embrace you. 

My massage was done by a lady named Tracy and she was very friendly and talked me through everything. I would highly recommend her. 

We then went for a swim, the pool is fantastic a nice temp with a separate jacuzzi pool at one end. The changing room was very spacious and exceptionally clean. 

After this we went back to the room and got ready for our meal in Sika restaurant. 

Again the meal was part of our package but as a result of the afternoon tea we explained this to the hostess who said that was fine. We asked our waiter was the package deal a 2 or 3 course meal he said 3. I still felt a little uneasy as I was not sure our waiter understood me properly so my husband went back to the hostess and asked what was part of our voucher and she said 3 courses. 

We both had pig belly for starters which was served with black pudding. I dislike the idea of black pudding but my husband said to try it, which I did and it was delicious. The belly was beautiful, the whole starter was fantastic. 

I had looked at the menu online before booking and had picked out the beef for my mains as it came with ribs but we were given a different menu and the beef was accompanied with an oxtail and marrow pie which I declined as I dislike oxtail. The beef itself was very tasty. My husband got the lamb and said it was nice but he was still hungry as the side between us was a small dish of new potatoes. 

For dessert we both went for the chocolate special as the way the waiter described it to us had both our mouths watering. They serve you a bowl with a dome of chocolate in the middle and they pour hot chocolate over the top which makes the dome melt. It is a lovely piece of showmanship but neither myself or my husband enjoyed the taste of it as the mint mousse was a strange mint flavour which overpowered everything else that came with it. 

We had a lovely bottle of Pinot Grigio and 2 bottles of Ballygowan still water (these are €6 each). When we asked for the bill again, even though we had stated 3 times as well as making the booking via email with voucher number, the bill showed the cost of the meals. My husband went to the hostess and explained she asked us to wait as she needed to verify the voucher with reception. By this time we were sitting at an empty table with no drinks or anything and it felt like people were looking at us as if we could not pay our bill it was embarrassing. After 20 minutes the hostess came over and asked us just to sign off on the receipt and she would sort it out later - I don't know why this could not have been done at the start. 

I think to stop this from happening again maybe when reception take the voucher they should issue some kind of tokens to be handed to the various  hosts as said before by not doing this it created a lot of unnecessary embarrassment and wasted valuable holiday time. 

We then went into McGills and had a nice few drinks before retiring to our room. 

We went for breakfast the following morning and as the sun was out we sat on the balcony. The selection of treats for breakfast was good and varied from your traditional Irish breakfast to pastries and even fresh pancakes. The table beside us were served omelettes we did not know this was an option so for future guests maybe ask a waiter. 

I would highly recommend this hotel for its rooms and the surrounding area. I think I would try food in either McGills or the Sugar Loaf as I was not overly impressed with Sika. 

I would love to stay here for two nights so I could properly explore the area.",4,2014,07,07
217,Absolute luxury,Our friends got us a suite here to start off our honeymoon. It was an amazing experience. The hotel and staff were real class. The spa was also fantastic and overall we had an amazing stay and a great start to our honeymoon. We would highly recommend it. ,5,2014,07,06
217,Nice Hotel,"The hotel is located in a beautiful setting and offers fantastic facilities. The swimming pool is fabolous. The breakfast spread excellent. The sugar loaf restaurant was disappointing, same menu on both nights and not 5 or 3 star quality food.",4,2014,07,06
217,"Excellent hotel, but watch your head.","Excellent hotel as you would expect. Staff are extremely well trained, food is excellent, views are fantastic. Full sized gym is great.
Only negative was the curtain pole came off the ceiling and fell on my partner, a large nail missed her face by inchs. By the look of the ceiling it has happened before - you have been warned.",5,2014,07,05
217,Our Favorite Place Ever,"It is hard to put into words how amazing this place is!  The regal grandeur it exudes is only surpassed by the amazing staff.  Jake Bowen at the front desk was so patient in answering questions as I planned our trip, even having to answer questions I forgot I had asked and asked again.  The breakfast at the hotel was amazing as was the entire staff, especially Tathy who was so awesome, Dario who so friendly and who had the chef make us a going-away dessert, and Agneski (sorry if that is spelled wrong) who had crepes made for us because we love them, and Helen (who was so friendly). !  I want to especially thank Jake (who I mentioned before), Zsolt (who lugged all our many bags to the room), Greg (a great source of info for the area and a restaurant recommendation), Oscar (who brought us cream for our coffee late at night), Niamh, Monica, Andrew and Victor (who were so nice at the front desk).  We have stayed in some fabulous places, and it is unanimous that this topped them all.",5,2014,07,02
217,Best hotel experience I've had in 25 years of traveling,"I travel extensively in my job, and my recent vacation stay at Powerscourt is at the very top of the list. I was a little pessimistic when I started traveling to this hotel/spa, and tried to find it with my GPS. I was not familiar with the ""driving on the left"" and quickly learned about the narrow roads in many parts of Ireland...including the mile or two in the vicinity of Powerscourt!

However, this concern evaporated quickly when we drove up to the beautiful reception area, and were greeted by Zsolt, who assisted us with our bags,took us to our room, and showed us all the features of out beautiful suite. Right away, my family knew we were in a very special place. Zsolt gave us several recommendations of things to do in the area.  These attractions supplemented those suggested by Jake at the concierge desk.

The hotel and spa were exquisite, from the lobby, to the room, restaurant, etc.  And the grounds of the hotel were superb, matching the beautiful view of Sugerloaf Mountain in the distance. Our room was so comfortable, we hated to go site seeing!

As a Marriott Platinum member, we enjoyed the lovely restaurant for breakfast every morning. A fabulous buffet was the perfect way to get us ready for our days of site seeing. And the restaurant staff were so friendly and helpful, starting with our first waitress Thaty, and our last waiter Dario. The manager Agnieska made sure we had a great table, and everything we needed.

If you ever get a chance to visit the Dublin area, I highly recommend you stay at Powerscourt!",5,2014,07,02
217,All around amazing stay,"Nothing to complain about at all, beds were comfortable, room was quiet, clean and well furnished, bathroom was of a great standard. Room service and restaurants reflected the standard of accommodation, the pup is a great place to kick back, relax and see where the night ends up. Staff were near perfect with enough flaws that they were perfectly human, There simply isn't anything to fault unless you want a spa treatment, those you will have to book well in advance of your stay and the pool is well worth the visit, the best thing was they had child free times so you could just relax without the loud noises that naturally accompany children having a great time.",5,2014,06,30
217,Great hotel,"Stayed here for 2 nights. Hotel is great and has some wonderful views. Staff are exceedingly helpful and polite.
The food is mediocre in the Lounge area. We did not try the bar or sit down restaurant.
The menu is limited if your staying more then a couple of nights. Soup of the day is really soup o every 2 days.
Seating area has a great view over looking the mountain.
We had a large double room with 2 double beds, which suited us perfectly. It was LARGE with plenty of space. It was on ground level ( main reception is on level 4 ! ), with levels above and below reception.
The bathroom was superb. One the the best I have come across.
Apart from the Hotel, I was not able to find any other places to eat within easy reach. So if you get fed up with hotel food, you'll need to travel a bit to find alternative.
Parking is free and easily accessible.
There is the Powerscourt shopping, a short walk from hotel. Here you can buy ""tourist"" tyep items and also gain access to the extensive gardens ( need to pay ). Unless you have good weather and time then I'd avoid the garden.
The breakfast was excellent, but still lacked freshly squeezed juice.
I can recommend this hotel for short stay for either couples or family.",4,2014,06,30
217,Quality and dog friendly.,"We stayed just one night on 21st June but wished we could have stayed longer. In my experience it's harder to find a quality hotel that is pet friendly but our Lhasa just fitted into the nice leather bed that the hotel provided. ( There is a size limit on dogs, think slipping your carry on airline bag in one of those measuring baskets)
The room was large and the bed one of the most comfortable we've slept in. A lovely meal in the restaurant and a walk around the grounds set us up for the long drive home the next day. The hotel is only 20 minutes from Dun Laoghaire for the ferry.
The check in staff were fantastic and very accommodating and friendly to us and the dog.
Looking forward to spending a few more nights in Powerscourt and would recommend it without hesitation.",5,2014,06,28
217,One of Our Very Favorite Hotels,"We have stayed here in 2009 and came back again in 2014. What makes this hotel special. There are many things. First the staff are all first class, friendly and helpful. Second, the beds and mattresses and pillows make for a great sleep at night. The workout facilities and pool are great. The breakfast is excellent, including the lattes or cappuccino coffees. We have enjoyed the golf course, walking to the village and everything about Powerscourt Hotel.",5,2014,06,28
217,Not quite as friendly as it used to be. Shame.,"We'd visited the hotel a number of times when it was the Ritz-Carlton and loved it so we were hoping it hadn't changed since it became the Powerscourt. Sadly, I think it has changed very slightly. To summarise, the prices are higher but the level of service is lower. This was immediately evident at check-in which was more brusque than previously with no inquiry as to whether we had been before and knew where to eat etc. Just handed the keys. Our suite was really lovely though with a balcony over-looking the garden, thankfully they haven't changed the rooms. Despite checking in at 5pm, our child's rollaway bed didn't appear for another hour along with the complimentary water (I was so thirsty I was about to drink one of the tiny €5 bottles of water from the mini-bar). Little touches like the welcome note and cookies the Ritz-Carlton provided are no longer done.

The food was fine, nothing outstanding, slightly disimproved in McGill's bar in particular. I was sent an online survey by the hotel upon return and think I gave the room 5 stars and the food 3 or 4, I think. The Food & Beverage manager then contacted me to ask exactly which dishes I had thought weren't great. So, in an attempt to be helpful, I tried to remember each one eaten and described it. No reply or thanks for it. Bad form. At breakfast, the manager looked at our ten year old and gleefully pronounced that she must be over 12. She seemed slightly crushed that she wasn't going to be able to charge for the extra breakfast as under 12s are free! 

My treatment with Robin in the spa was excellent. 

Overall, I felt the hotel has become less warm and friendly with staff a little dismissive of guests. Not quite as contemptuous as the awful Carton House, for example,  but it seems to be heading that way. We'll probably give it one more try in the hope it can win us back over again. It used to be our favourite.",4,2014,06,27
217,Fabulous,I stayed here on the 15th of June for my friends 40th we had a great stay from start to finish the room was amazing heated floor in the bathroom TV flush with the mirror in the bathroom also.the spa was out of this world although maybe treatments a little bit pricey but couldn't fault it.staff were so nice and helpful and very professional I'll definitely be back well done everyone!,5,2014,06,23
217,Luxury and good value,"This hotel is located on a hill near a small Enniskerry village in Wicklow county. The spot is beautiful and the hotel room with mountain view gave just that - spectacular view. The hotel is luxurious. Rooms very nice and have good space and top quality. Breakfast very good as well.
During our stay we only faced friendly, helpful and genuinely smily staff whether they it was at reception, breakfast room or maintenance. I appreciate that a lot as it is not always the case even in luxury hotels. It was not the cheapest option around, though not specifically expensive either. Very good value for money to my opinion. Really enjoyed our stay there!",5,2014,06,22
217,Incredible stay.,"I was planning on staying at The Shelborne in downtown Dublin but it was booked for the period I was going to be there so I had to settle for the Powerscourt Hotel. My wife was not very happy about it. However, once we arrived, wow, what a hotel. She changed her tune pretty quickly. I didn’t realize it was a resort. They put me in a one-bedroom suite that I can honestly say was palatial. Heated bathroom floors, a TV in the bathroom mirror, a full kitchen with its own entrance, a gorgeous living room and a balcony the size of some regular hotel rooms. The grounds and common areas are exquisite. We had breakfast out on the terrace that has a wonderful view of the Irish countryside. Now keep in mind that the hotel is not in Dublin. It’s about a 20 minute drive and it’s a little tricky to find even with a GPS, but very much worth it especially since it cost me much less than staying at the Shelborne.",5,2014,06,22
217,The Best Place to Stay Dublin,"We stayed at the Powerscourt Hotel May/June 2014, and we actually wished we had spend both weeks in the area and skipped England. 

The hotel is easily 5 stars, the rooms are elegant and well appointed, featherbeds, feather duvets, etc. I slept better than at home. The rooms include hair dryers, power converters, big oversized towels, sewing kits, shoe shine, irons, toiletries, internet, flat screen televisions, beautiful bathrooms etc. (Roll away beds are not the typical folded lump, they are true beds, appointed in the same manner as our main king bed, just on wheels.) It is simply my favorite Marriott hotel to date.

The rooms also have a mini-bar, a bit pricey, but the town of Enniscary is just a few minutes by car and a quick walk. The town has wonderful restaurants and pubs, with music on the weekends. A Spar market is also in town with a great selection of wine, beer, soda and snacks. 

The rooms come with a breakfast buffet that is hard to describe, they have an amazing selection of breads (the brown bread became my weakness), fruits, jams, meats, cheeses, crepes and other breakfast items, the tables fill one of the banquet rooms. Hint: Be kind to the staff, may Americans came across as very demanding, the pace is slower and kindness is rewarded with wonderful conversation and even more wonderful service. 

The staff is absolutely fabulous, the rooms were always immaculate, and turn down service was efficient  adding water and chocolate to the bedside tables. 

The Sugar Loaf Lounge has wonderful choices for light meals and a beautiful view of the grounds. Make a reservation if you want the best view. The pub in the basement was okay for a different vibe. Try the Erdinger beers from Germany and of course one must have a pint of Guinness. 

The Powerscourt Estate and Gardens are a quick walk from the hotel. The gardens are 47 acres of beautiful plants and water features, it is considered to be on of the top 10 gardens in the world. The actual manor house burned down just before its grand renovation was complete in 1975, but the outer shell remained. They have added shops and a restaurant. The Avoca shop offers a variety of shipping plans, very reasonable and even free depending on the amount you spend, if staying at the hotel. Do not miss the river walk, you can take your car through the gate and park at the bottom if you want to avoid the one hill. 

I could spend 5 days at this location and never leave....however it is a quick 30 minutes by car to Dublin (parking can be tough in Dublin, but much cheaper and easier on the south side of the river). It is also 3 hours from the Cliffs of Moher and an hour from Waterford.

We will definitely return, it was a fabulous holiday and we fell in love with the hotel, staff and area.",5,2014,06,18
217,An elegant hotel. A wonderful staff.,"We were awed by the beauty of this luxurious hotel.  The photos don't exaggerate one bit.  We were greeted by the charming Victor and later helped by the knowledgeable and clever concierge, Robbie.  He told us we should definitely see the Wicklow mountains and I'm so glad he did because it was a wonderful drive up to Glencree and Glendalough, past Guinness Lake.  A magical two days at the Powerscourt.  Thank you to all!",5,2014,06,18
217,Luxury at its best,"hotel is located in a beautiful green countryside of Ireland, 30mn away from Dublin. The hotel is exteremelly luxurious by any standard. The rooms are spacious, beatufilly designed and boost modern equipment. Service is outstanding. For romance or get away, a perfect spot in Ireland.",5,2014,06,17
217,"Beautiful, staff awesome, best place to stay","What a fabulous place to stay to explore Dublin and the surrounding countryside!  This was a trip I waited 40 years to take and Powerscourt and the staff made our stay wonderful!  Friendly, helpful and the pub downstairs was great!  Close enough to take the train to Dublin and a great stopping off place to explore Ireland!  Definitely recommend it!",5,2014,06,16
217,Simply Outstanding!,"Stayed here for 4 days at a conference and were literally blown away by the setting, service, quality of food and the room. It is adjacent to the Powerscourt Manor and Gardens which are breathtaking. It is a little pricey but well worth it in my books",5,2014,06,16
217,"Beautiful and luxurious, but a few downers","We had a few small issues with the service in the beginning as we weren't shown to our rooms, only 1 of which was ready. We weren't told when or where breakfast and dinner were served or where the spa was located. One of our rooms wasn't ready for over an hour after check in tiime which is normally no problem for me but we were only staying one night. We also tried to pre book the thermal suite in the spa and was told there would be plenty of space and no need to do so, but when we arrived it was full. So a few bad points on a hotel which has a high status, and which is insanely expensive. 
The rooms were beautifully decorated and we had stunning views of the sugarloaf mountain. The beds were so comfy it was hard to tear away from them! Our room did have a chunk out of the wall and a few small marks on walls, stains etc nothing id normally note but it is very expensive and I would expect a little more upkeep for the cost. 
Our meal was magnificent and insanely decadent! The staff in the dining room were the best. At both dinner and breakfast they impressed and were very warm and friendly. 
All in all we had a great night stay here but I was a little disappointed with standards given.",3,2014,06,15
217,Amazing,"Stayed in a suite earlier on this year . The whole stay was amazing , starting with the fabulous suite we stayed in , to the food , the setting and the very attentive staff . Wont be long until we stay again . You wont be disappointed believe me .",5,2014,06,14
217,"Beautiful property, great service!","We had a lovely one week long stay here at the Powerscourt, now part of Marriotts Autograph collection. It was a Ritz Carlton previously and you can definitely still tell this when you enter the lobby and your room. The look is very traditional with heavy curtains and floral fabrics. The rooms' bathrooms have white marble and are spacious with lovely toiletries. 

The food was very good with a wonderful breakfast buffet each morning with both american and Irish specialties. The pub downstairs was fun and also had good food and anything you'd want to drink. For lunch we ate in the lobby lounge and it was delicious-- try the seafood chowder with brown bread to warm you up on a rainy Irish day!

The service was excellent - everyone was so friendly and respectful. We got lots of great advice from the concierge and front desk about places to go to. We stayed here for six nights and drove around each day to different castles and landmarks. We really trusted the opinion of the staff and they were so helpful with maps, suggestions and tips!  

Next door is a beautiful old estate and gardens with amazing shops and a cafe. There's even a dollhouse museum which my ten year old daughter loved. You can walk here from the hotel. 

I would HIGHLY recommend this property!  They made our trip to Ireland so memorable.  These Irish eyes are a smiling after this stay!!",5,2014,06,13
217,The little touches,"My boyfriend & I are just back from a lovely 2 night stay at your hotel. On arrival we were greeted by Victor who was smiling & welcoming which instantly gave us a good feeling about the place. Our room was lovely, spacious & welcoming. The scones upon arrival were a lovely touch, as we had just travelled for 3 hours and they were the perfect snack before dinner. The hotel itself is beautiful, the decor and gardens are fab. Tucked away in the beautiful woodland. We had dinner in the Sika restaurant. Upon booking, i had been asked if it was for a special occasion, it was my boyfriends birthday. Having already found a lovely card in our room wishing him well. We certainly didn't expect more. After we had finished dinner, we had just asked for the bill, when the very nice waiter came down with a lovely cheesecake with a candle on top & decorated in chocolate writing wishing him happy birthday. It was such a beautiful gesture, we were smiling all night. I was so glad I had chosen this hotel for his birthday treat :) the staff in the Sika restaurant were fab, so friendly without being fake. The spa area, pool etc was lovely. Most amazing pool I've witnessed. I had a treatment which was fine. I felt my therapist was a little unconfident which made the experience only okay. As a therapist of a 5* resort myself and working in the hospitality industry, this hotel completely won us over for the very kind gestures & staff. Only snag was that the Food and drink a little overpriced! Thanks for a great stay. ",5,2014,06,12
217,Spectacular,"This property is among the best I have stayed.  The hotel is well laid out and the service was outstanding.  The food at the hotel was terrific and we loved the pub downstairs.  We would definitely return.  As well, the gardens next door were truly incredible, and I'm not really a garden type person.",5,2014,06,12
217,Dated in need of a bit of cash injection. ,"We visited this hotel for afternoon tea. The car park is in need of some maintenance over grown in parts. On entering this impressing building  the staff smoking area is in full view of the entrance, not a good impression.The bar and service was good but the floor in the bar is in need of repair, scratches and need of a varnish. All in all nice afternoon but a bit dated.  ",3,2014,06,12
217,"Incredible room, great experience","The room seems more like a luxury condo than a hotel. Overlooking the sugar loaf mountain, and a large balcony, this well appointed hotel has an amazing bathroom , walk in closet and bedroom area that feels like a large condominium. The pool and spa cannot be explained by pictures as this hotel is an incredible experience. Then you walk down the street to one of the most beautiful gardens in the world. The Powerscourt Hotel and estate is truly a remarkable area. Photo's cannot tell the story, as it was a great experience.",5,2014,06,10
217,Really Good but not Great!!,"Booked a suite for a special occasion and the room itself was really amazing.. loads of space and beautifully decorated. There are free bikes available for guests, with complementary bottles of water and a map. The staff were friendly at reception and for room service. The hotel had a nice relaxing atmosphere with a nice pool and spa. The nearby gardens are really nice and the big chess board in the garden is cool. I made a note that it was a trip for my engagement and the reception girl was very nice about it.  

I found the breakfast a bit poor and expensive, I would recommend taking the complemenatary shuttle to the town instead and spending your money there. I noted on my reservation that my girlfriend is a coeliac with reference in particular for options for breakfast. But no note was made of this so although coeliac bread is available we had to wait 15mins for it. Might sound like a small thing, but I have stayed in BnBs where the staff have made a note of it. 

All in all, nice staff, a fantastic location and building,, but I would work on the food a little bit.",4,2014,06,09
217,Amazing Hotel,Stayed here in May and it was amazing from start to finish.  Exceptionally friendly staff.  Dinner delicious.  The Spa was gorgeous. The room was the nicest hotel room I have ever stayed in.  I hated leaving!!! Thoroughly recommend it.,5,2014,06,09
217,Beautiful hotel!,"We  just stayed at the Powerscourt for 6 nights as part of a Groupon deal.  The hotel was every bit as beautiful as the reviews say it is.  The staff was wonderful, from checking in, to every trip they drove us into the village of Enniskerry.  Our room was amazing.  We loved the touch pad controls for the lights and thermostat, and the bathroom mirror TV was definitely a new concept!    The pool area was unique and very relaxing.  We would return to the Powerscourt or recommend it to others without hesitation!  ",5,2014,06,08
217,Great hotel in amazing surroundings,"The hotel is just great. Huge rooms, very nice breakfast, lovely pub. Haven't actually tried the spa, but everybody I travelled with was impressed by how nice it was. Food at the bar is overpriced, go to the pub downstairs for a nice ""light"" dinner.
The gardens surrounding the hotel are just amazing. There is a golf course very close. And if you want a quiet sleep, you got it! No cars, no neighbouring buildings, just the peace of the surrounding forest and gardens at night.
Would definitely go there again.
(check the alarm clocks provided in the rooms, on our stay we got woken up by a 5AM alarm forgotten by a previous guest)",5,2014,06,08
217,Wonderful!,"Great spot, absolutely fabulous views, very spacious suites with beautiful bathroom & toiletries, really delicious breakfast & dinner in Sugar Loaf Lounge - both overlooking the Sugar Loaf Mountains and dinner in McGill's was to a v high standard served by friendly bar staff. It has a really great pool, only open to children from 9-12 & 3-6 but that's enough! Staff were fantastic at all times!",5,2014,06,07
217,Disappointing stay,"

The following is our firsthand experience of the Powerscourt hotel. We stayed at this hotel on Sunday of the bank holiday in June and were very disappointed that there was no entertainment of any kind there that night. The place lacked atmosphere. We were informed that there was entertainment in the nearby village. Considering we had booked into this hotel and paid well for it, the hotel should have provided some form of entertainment. The whole purpose of the night away way to relax in that hotel and not be told to go to a pub in the village!! Some staff in restaurant were not friendly or polite. Prices in restaurant were overpriced also. We weren't very impressed overall. ",1,2014,06,06
217,Five-Star Hotel on a Groupon,"Two of us stayed six nights in May 2014 at the Powerscourt; it's huge, and hugely luxurious; our bathroom had double doors; the toilet and the shower were each modestly tucked away behind swinging etched-glass doors, and we would have needed a ladder to get into the bathtub. The beds are comfortable, the rooms are a generous size (closets are in a separate niche from the main room).  The view from any of the windows is lovely.  Amenities beyond the room:  three or four venues for food, daily teas in the olympic-size lobby, generous parking space, some covered.  Around the hotel, beautiful gardens,some of them formal, and one large paved open space with a fountain/sculpture in the center and potted plants in each corner, and around each of these was a labyrinth marked in the concrete, a comfortable size for meditation.  Only drawback for us: the price of meals.",4,2014,06,05
217,Nice overall,"Location is beautiful once you know what to expect. You will need a car. The staff were excellent overall.

Since you would expect everything to be impeccable for the price I'm gonna point out the few negatives;

* Breakfast is poorly organized. There were no menus on the tables to order non buffet eggs or coffee. None available either when asked. Self service coffee is drip coffee only, nothing fancy unless you want to wave down an overworked waitress and wait. The breakfast room was like a creche on Sunday morning. The baby on the table next to me was shrieking like it was being skinned alive, parents just ignored it and tended to their cake. I asked if I could be moved, as you are not allowed to sit where you like, and the waitress tried moving me to the table next to the one I was at, an entire meter further away from the ear piercing shrieking baby and its cake loving guardians.

* TV does not accept USB stick input (I have gotten used to this as a basic feature in any half decent hotel)

* No ice machine on my floor. Staff were helpful but I didn't enjoy bothering them everytime I fancied ice.

Overall I'd go again but I'd skip the breakfast if going on a weekend.",4,2014,06,05
217,Fantastic end to an amazing trip,"This was our last stop after a 10 day road trip through Ireland. We purposefully wanted to stay somewhere outside of Dublin, but close to the hotel. Powerscourt could not have been more perfect.

We arrived exhausted, grimy, and a lot hungover. From the outside we were expecting five-star pretentiousness but the reception was extremely friendly and accommodating. It probably also helped that we were updated to a suite! 

When we walked into our room our jaws dropped. There was so much space that I was literally running laps from room to room. Normally you pick a hotel because it's centrally located to something you want to see. I would pick this hotel just to stay at the hotel! We honestly did not want to leave the room. 

And...it was the only hotel of our entire trip that had air conditioning. We probably sound like spoiled Americans but trust me it did not go unappreciated. 

We also thoroughly enjoyed the indoor pool and hammam located within the spa but were open to guests of the hotel. When we did leave the hotel, it was to use the hotel bicycles to explore the grounds (Powerscourt Estate & Gardens are literally right next door).

Our trip could not have ended on a higher note.",5,2014,06,03
217,Great Experience,"Staying at the Powerscourt Hotel was the best hotel experience I've ever had. The comfort of the room was fantastic.  The service was impeccable. The staff at the Powerscourt was genuinely happy to provide service and also was genuinely happy.  Every member of the staff that I interacted with was pleasant; they all remembered that they are in the hospitality business something that is lost on some hotel staffs, especially 5 star hotels.  The Powerscourt is a 5 star hotel without the stuffy attitude.  The facilities were wonderful including the pool and spa.  I haven't mentioned the views or the Estate grounds which are beautiful and there's a golf course on the grounds.  The food at the Sika Restaurant was excellent, especially the breakfast buffet. Lunch and/or afternoon tea at the The Sugar Loaf Lounge was very nice and McGills was a nice place to eat and have a pint or two. I'd recommend The Powerscourt to anyone and everyone.",5,2014,06,03
217,Another excellent stay,"This is our second time staying at the Powercourt Hotel - the first was while it was a Ritz-Carlton property, and now under its new guise as just the Powerscourt (but still owned by Marriott, who own Ritz-Carlton). Not much has changed apart from some of the signs and the hotel is still a nice as it was before. We booked a total of 3 rooms throughout the hotel and they kindly put us all just next to each other on the same floor which was handy. The food is of good quality (we had breakfast in the room and also in the restaurant and we were never let down). All hotels in the brand have some special Children's actiivies and this has a special kids room (which is rather hidden down a fire escape) which was perfect for a rainy day although it does close rather early so we couldn't enjoy it as much as we'd liked. All of the staff here are very helpful and the hotel is very well priced for the standard you get there. We will definitely be back next time we are in Ireland!",5,2014,06,01
217,Luxurious rooms and helpful staff,"My husband and I just returned from a 7 day stay at Powerscourt. The hotel amenities are wonderful.  The room was roomy, gorgeous and relaxing.  The bathroom was perfect - if I win the lottery and get to build my dream home - the bathroom will be modeled after Powerscourt.  We had a few days of rainy weather so we enjoyed the spa and room service :)  The hotel offers a free car service to town which was helpful, but keep in mind, town is small with limited dining options.  

Breakfast was included in our package and it was wonderful! I loved the scones, smoked salmon and Irish porridge. So many options!! 

The staff was wonderful overall. There were a few standouts - Stephen, Jayne and Zjolt were particularly helpful and friendly.  

Hotel is close to Johnnie Fox, Glendalough, Powerscourt Gardens and Waterfall, all of which should not be missed.",5,2014,06,01
217,Lack of attention to detail in McGills,"Had to wait approx 20 mins to get the attention of the barman, the had to wait 5 mins for 2 drinks! Music advertised to begin at 10pm, here we are at 11.40pm still waiting for music to start..... More staff needed to cope with demand & more realistic time frames should be given to guests re music start times",2,2014,05,30
217,Oh my word - fabulous,Second stay at this stunning hotel. This time took my mum and we were given an update to a suite and it was absolutely beautiful.  Staff were fantastic and very friendly. Hotel absolutely sumptuous but not pretentious. Loved it.,5,2014,05,30
217,Great staff and service.,"I've been to Powerscourt Hotel twice in the past few months and twice when it was still the Ritz Carlton.  Each time we have enjoyed our stay.  The only problem is if you go out of peak season some of the facilities are not available.  We had to eat in the bar downstairs and to be honest the food served was dreadful, with T.V blaring and certainly not a place I would return to again for a meal.  However, the facilities at Powerscourt Hotel are excellent, we were upgraded to a suite on our last stay and we really appreciated it.  Breakfast is excellent and although the transition has lost some of the 'little touches' service and standard is very high.  The staff are friendly and not stuffy in the least, unlike some other 5 star hotels.  We love the spa / fitness level and would recommend leaving time to truly relax and get the full Powerscourt Hotel experience. We will be frequent visitors .",4,2014,05,29
217,Impressive start to finish,"This was our third trip to Ireland and my wife and I have stayed in some fine hotels along the way. Powerscourt Hotel ranks at the top. Our suite was spacious with all the amenities one would expect from a five-star hotel, and very clean. The bed, sheets, and pillows were as comfortable as we have at home. In the bathroom, our shower had a 'rain-type' shower-head, which I particularly enjoyed, plus there was a TV screen integrated into the large mirror over the dual sinks. The hotel has a formal restaurant, a pub, or you can eat in the lobby; all our meals were very good. The most impressive aspect of our stay was the hotel staff; every person we encountered went the beyond the call of duty to ensure our experience was the best it could be. For example, I called the Powerscourt Concierge two weeks before we arrived to book a couple of tee-times at golf courses near by. It barely took an hour and the Powerscourt Concierge confirmed via email the tee-times including golf clubs rental. 

Golf-wise, there are two courses within walking distance of the hotel. The East Course was site of the 1996 European PGA Championship and the West Course was designed by famed golf course designer David McClay Kidd. I golfed on the East Course and it was in excellent condition with some spectacular views and it is walkable. The rental golf clubs were a full complete set of Titlest brand. 

Powerscourt Hotel is located just a couple of minutes drive from Enniskerry, about 45 minutes south of Dublin. This location makes it convenient for sightseeing both to the south or to the north of Dublin. 

If we return to Ireland and look to stay in this area again, Powerscourt Hotel will be the first we call for reservations.",5,2014,05,29
217,Pure luxury,This hotel is amazing. If You want to stay somewhere that feels luxurious and truly pamper yourself this is definitely the place to be.  Amazing views. Very close to the gardens.  Stayed here for just one night using my points from Marriott. Was upgraded to a fantastic room. Felt like a queen,5,2014,05,29
217,Still awesome,"Second time in this awesome property, now Powerscourt Hotel, former The Ritz-Carlton Powerscourt at my first stay in May 2011. I was ansious to check this hotel out with the new management, but I can say that nothing has change besides the brand. The main restaurant, now Sika, is still perfect. Nice Irish breakfast in the morning with a good sort of treats and food. The McGill´s pub still keeps the good atmosphere. Check-in, room service, cleaness, remain five-star for a reasonable fare. Free car transportation is granted to go to the village nearby (1.3 mile from the hotel), which has some restaurants choices. I really want to have a third experience at the Powerscourt.",5,2014,05,28
217,Marvellous Hotel,"I stayed at this Hotel for three nights in May, I could not fault the service, the food, the facilities or the beautiful rooms.  The surroundings are spectacular with beautiful gardens and peaceful walks.  It was a good place to be based, not that far out of Dublin and close to lovely other places like the village of Enniskerry itself, Bray with it's victorian sea front and Glendalough for it's peace and tranquility.  My only very slight disappointment is that there are two restaurants available of an evening, one is fine dining, the other a pub, I think a brasserie or similar available in the evening would be a great addition to have something ""in between"".  However that said, I would heartily recommend this hotel if you feel like a touch of luxury.",5,2014,05,28
217,Outstanding hotel,"This hotel was wonderful!  We stayed 6 nights and were able to enjoy many of the amenities.  The spa was lovely with whirlpool, steam room, suana, and a beautiful relaxation room.  My massage was heavenly.  The fitness center was large with more than adequate machines and weights.  However, the best part was the pool and whirlpool with subdued lighting and music.  They have set hours that are only for adults and other times for children.  The breakfast has a large selection  of  a variety of hot and cold breakfast foods.  Unless you get a discount, the breakfast is very expensive and overpriced.  The dinner at Sika was the best dinner we had in our 2 weeks in Ireland.  It is also pricey, but worth it for a special occasion.  The pub was a good choice for a casual meal with good food.
   The service in the hotel was outstanding.  All of the staff were always willing to do whatever it took to make our stay pleasant.  One of the amenities which was quite nice was the complimentary car shuttle to Enniskerry.  We didn't get to use the complementary bikes, but wish we had made the time to do so.   Powerscourt Gardens is a must to see.  
   In summary, this was a fabulous hotel that I can't wait to visit again.",5,2014,05,27
217,Excellent,"I stayed one night on a Saturday night with my 2 children aged 9 and 12.  Check in was efficient and friendly and the initial impression given by the lobby and staff was very good.  We had thought we were booked into a room with 2 double beds but on checking in our booking showed as one king.   However an extra bed in the room was immediately sorted out by reception staff.  The room was beautiful with every modern convenience and more.  It was really elegantly furnished, spacious and very comfortable. The children particularly enjoyed watching TV from the bath!  We used the pool on 2 occasions and it is very good and the changing facilities excellent with plenty of towels and lovely spa toiletries.  Dinner in McGills was excellent and I enjoyed the live music in the lounge afterwards.   Overall a lovely evening.  The only small point I would make for improvement would be to have the games room open (and better equipped - my children commented that some of the equipment was missing or damaged) in the evening as it currently closes at 6.  It would be handy for the children to be able to go somewhere to play table tennis, snooker or table football in the evenings as the bar and lobby are not that suitable for children later in the evening.   Breakfast was super with every choice of  hot and continental food available (including pancakes which were very much enjoyed).  Overall an excellent stay in a lovely hotel.",5,2014,05,26
217,"Just like a Palace, beautiful scenery and excellent service!","We went there as a anniversary trip which was made into such a great experience thanks to the many people at this hotel.We were kind of skeptical with the hotel being 30 min from city center Dublin at first. Once we stepped into the hotel, the grandeur assured us of our pick. After a long flight and a scary manual car wrong side driving trip from the airport, we arrived at the Powerscourt Gardens. The area is beautiful with palace like gardens, beautiful scenery and a great waterfall just minutes away from your retreat. If you want to relax this is a great place to go!

People - Every person we met was very wary of your needs and wanted to please you. The information desk helped us book reservations for the city, a Broadway play(he even paid with his credit card which had to be local and charged our room for it) as well as driving directions, plans and times for every road trip we took. They were absolutely amazing!

Food - They have the BEST fish and chips I've ever had! I had them three days out of my 7 day stay. The other restaurants were also amazing and first class. They even have their own traditional PUB inside the hotel. 

Rooms - We got a deal for the suite and fell in love with the room. His and hers closets, great shower with hidden behind mirror tv, tv room and bedroom. Everything was automated from the comfort of where you were. Very homey room which we did not want to leave!

Amenities - Being next to the gardens(part of it) we would have thought it would be included in the hotel. Not a huge charge but it would be a great amenity for guests. Still, gardens were beautiful and worth every cent. The SPA was incredible! We had a couples massage after seeing the pool which is lighted like a black sky with twinkling stars at the bottom of the pool. Just being there gave you a sensational feeling. My wife took a regular massage and I took a special Irish stick massage.... ( I would keep to the traditional, it was a little too different at times.) They had aromatherapy to your liking and the relaxing jacuzzi private suite with a view was second to none. DEFINITELY recommend using the spa area!

Overall, the surroundings were beautiful, the place is spectacular, food and service is great! It might be a little far away for the daily Dublin commute but great for the explorer like us. We visited a few different cities daily and went back to our comfy room.",5,2014,05,22
217,Great getaway from Dublin,"We have been here a few times for a quiet, convenient, getaway from the city. We've always enjoyed it, nice rooms, good food, and beautiful surroundings. It's a bit pricey, but I'm sure we'll be back again.",5,2014,05,22
217,Unbelievable hotel,We stayed here on first night of our honeymoon when they found out they went out of there way to make extra special for us. The location is ideal with great walks scenery and you are only 30min from Dublin City centre.for an upmarket hotel it is so relaxed. The staff are very genuine and very helpfull. The food in restaurant is to die for and I couldn't believe how responsible it was. The spa is a great experience and pool area is such a relaxing spot. Well worth a stay,5,2014,05,21
217,Lovely food and service,"Had an anniversary dinner here with the hubby! Dinner was fab and our server Daniele was great  very confident and a natural at the job..
Ate here before when it was Ramsey's and it was also fab! But it felt a little more relaxed which was lovely  look forward to our next visit..",5,2014,05,21
217,One of the best hotels in Europa,"I've stayed at numerous hotels and have rarely left and immediately booked for a return visit. I loved the peace and relaxation. There were so many beautiful and thoughtful touches that I can't recommend it highly enough. The food was fantastic and of an incredibly high standard. The rooms were large, clean and the bathrooms were fantastic. The spa and hotel is one of the best and staff immediately put you at ease. Wonderful location so peaceful but within close proximity to Dublin, Bray etc.",5,2014,05,20
217,Very good; some room for improvement,"We stayed in February 2014, our party of two adults and four young children.

Our inter-connecting rooms were the best we have ever stayed in, extremely spacious, and our children availed of the 'tent and torch' in-room camping experience, which gave them a great thrill.

Breakfast was excellent in quality.  It is buffet style, with hot food also available to order.  I felt the staff could have been a tiny bit more pro-active in assisting me, when I arrived down for breakfast with four children under the age of eight, including a baby - while I appreciate buffets require guests to serve themselves, someone should have offered to help me carry the children's juices and cereals to the table, or provided a tray for me to do it myself.

The fine-dining restaurant is very good, with knowledgeable staff and an excellent wine list.

Areas for improvement are as follows:  
- The children were made feel very welcome, but a little more thought is required for the lounge menu to offer smaller, less expensive options for children.  
- The children's play-room, which is not supervised (which is fine), also needs work - no ball for the ping-pong table; ragged dress-up costumes which have seen better days.  
- We ordered room service for the children one evening, as we were getting a babysitter so we could have a birthday dinner for two in the restaurant.  No arrangement was made to collect the food trolley before the children went to sleep, so it was still there the next morning - not nice to wake up with food still in the room.

However, our overall experience was very good, and we will likely return in the Autumn.  It would be great to see these small items addressed.",4,2014,05,20
217,Outstanding hotel in the Irish countryside,"This is a gem of a luxury hotel south of Dublin. It is off the beaten path but worth the trip. From the moment we arrived we were treated warmly and every accommodation was made to make us welcome. The staff was simply outstanding during our entire trip. The lobby is elegant and the views of the surrounding countryside were spellbinding.  Our room was spotless and well kept for our entire visit. There a two restaurants and a pub. We were given vouchers for 1/2 off the breakfast buffet.  There is also a wonderful spa and a pool that you have to see. The desk and the concierge helped us by suggesting some ways to enjoy our visit. We had rented a car and the concierge mapped out a trip around County Wicklow that turned out to be wonderful. hey booked the rail and bus tour for us to go to the west and see the Cliffs of Moher and drove us into Enniskerry and picked us up when we went into the village. Everything was friendly yet very professional. This is not some bed and breakfast, it is a luxury hotel so be prepared to spend money for food and drinks. That being said, it is worth every penny. We will return - without a doubt.",5,2014,05,19
217,"Excellent location, fabulous bedroom","Large luxurious bedroom, tv in bathroom, very comfy bed. Pool and jacussi lovely. Disappointed that the lounge wasn't open for dinner. Had dinner in the bar,nice but not 5 star standard. Breakfast service needs attention to detail. The 'hot' buffet should not be lukewarm and the plates should not be cold. Otherwise enjoyed our stay. Very pleasant.",4,2014,05,19
217,Always a great experience!,"We've been to Powerscourt Hotel three times and we always had a great time. Hotel and surrounding area are fantastic, food is delicious and staff is very friendly and helpful. Atmosphere is relaxing, but service is professional and high quality. It is also very close to Dublin if you need access to the city.",5,2014,05,17
217,Lovely hotel & amazing spa,"Myself and my partner stayed here for one night for my birthday. There was a problem with our booking on arrival but this was quickly sorted out. We booked a mountain view suite and it was beautiful. Two separate rooms with a balcony overlooking the grounds and the mountain. We had afternoon tea with a glass of prosecco and it was lovely. We also had a massage each as part of the package we booked. The spa is absolutely beautiful! I had a full body massage and it was the best I ever had, unfortunately I cannot remember the ladies name! After your treatment you are brought to the relaxing room where you can sit on a reclining lounger and gaze out at the mountain and read and sip on a refreshing drink. My only regret is that I didn't bring a swimsuit to try out the pool! I was so relaxed after being in the spa. Would highly recommend as a treat! ",5,2014,05,17
217,Pleasant trip down memory lane,"We came for an overnight stay to use a voucher given to us specially because we had stayed here when our daughter was married from the hotel a couple of years ago, so we knew the kind of things to expect.  

Check-in was prompt and efficient and we were escorted to our room on the 5th floor, overlooking the fountain garden and towards the Sugarloaf, very pleasant indeed.  The standard rooms are well-appointed and have a separate dressing room plus a desk area, should you wish to work or write anything.  The bathroom is spacious, with a lovely walk-in rainforest shower as well as a big bath.

Our voucher included dinner in the Sika restaurant;  our one slight gripe was that we could only get a 7 pm reservation, and we prefer to eat a little later.  I noticed that most diners arrived no later than 7.30 and I wonder if this was the kitchen's benefit, as there was a largish (12 or 14?) group which came in later.  However, this was outweighed by the positives!  The manager checked concerning my shellfish allergy (which the restaurant had asked about when they rang us the pervious day to confirm our reservation).  The menu is fairly short but there is something there for everyone, and I was most impressed by the staff's knowledge of the components of each course and also the food provenance.  Well done all round!  My husband had scallops followed by John Dory, while I started with goat's cheese (a little bit bland) and then beautifully cooked lamb done three ways. I was slightly disappointed with the chocolate bombe - it is presented spectacularly, with the server pouring hot sauce over the chocolate ball, which then collapses to reveal what's inside - but you end up with what is basically chocolate soup!  However, that was my problem!

Overall, though, it was a delicious meal, and as we were put under no pressure to vacate our table, we were able to sit over our drinks and watch the moon rise over the Sugarloaf.  Beginning to feel pleasantly tired, we retired to our room, but alas, I did not get the good night's sleep I was looking forward to.  Both the bedside clock-radio and the phone has very bright display panels, which meant the room was never completely dark, and as for the electronic control of the lights - three times during the night I was woken by my bedside light coming on, seemingly by itself!  I then had to try and switch it off....   Also, the pillows were very soft, and had we been staying for an extra night, I would have asked for more, but that's a personal preference.

Breakfast is also served in the Sika room, and apart from your tea or coffee it's buffet style - but what a choice!  Almost everything you could think of.....  The cooked breakfast comes with scrambled eggs as standard, but I prefer a fried egg and this was done very quickly for me.  Again, there is a listing of the provenance of many of the items.  An extra plus to the kitchen because they were able to provide me with Marmite on request!  One little criticism would be that the plates and the cooked items could be hotter.

We were glad to find that the service ethic still underpins this hotel, even under new management, and certainly every member of staff with whom we came into contact was friendly and helpful.",4,2014,05,14
217,Fantastic hotel with beautiful rooms away from the city,"Stayed at Powersourt during a conference earlier this year. The place is absolutely beautiful right from the moment you walk through the doors! The staff were really friendly and extremely helpful which is always a very good quality to look out for. My room was absolutely stunning! It was big and spacious with a walk in closet, a separate sitting room, a larger than average bedroom and a double sized bathroom. The room service was meticulous while the food served in the hotel was seriously delicious and up to standard. If you fancy a place outside of Dublin I would recommend the Powerscourt - its the perfect retreat to revive yourself! (And they have amazing wines too!)",5,2014,05,14
217,"Superb property, let down a bit by staff","The hotel is fantastic. The guest rooms are luxurious without being obnoxious. The TV in the mirror of the bathroom is a nice detail. The heating and lighting are remote controlled and make sense. The meeting room was well equipped and comfortable. The only slight let down was service in the ‘Irish’ bar. Ordering food took a long time, one menu was given for 7 people, and we had to ask for more. Empty drinks glasses were not taken from the table and new orders had to be brought to the table. The bar was not that busy and this level of service did not match the rest of the hotel. One got the impression that the focus of bar staff was on elderly American tourists who tip well.",4,2014,05,14
217,"Stunning room with comfy beds , a luxurious overnight treat .","We were warmly greeted on arrival ,check in was easy & we were escorted along with our overnight bags to our room where we were given a rundown on how to work all the electronic touchscreen gadgets . Our room was very impressive , extremely spacious ,  very opulent bathroom &  luxurious comfortable beds. We had a beautiful big balcony looking over the garden and fountain with the sugarloaf mountain in the distance. Our package including champagne afternoon tea, serve in the lounge . The sandwiches were pre-made beforehand so unfortunately  the bread was a tad bit stale !!!! That night we have a pleasant meal in Mc Gill's pub , the menu was varied and the pub was busy with a nice atmosphere . We opted to have our breakfast in our room the following morning. Breakfast was delivered on time, everything we ordered was there, porridge pipping hot beautiful pastries & hot fab coffee . We were lucky as it was a glorious sunny warm morning so we ate breakfast on the balcony reading the delivered newspaper in the sunshine, this concluded off my overnight treat in The Powerscourt Hotel to perfection. Hope i get the chance for a return visit someday ........",4,2014,05,13
217,Fantastic 5 star hotel but sometimes the service isn't 5 star,"Overall we had a fabulous stay in Powercourt Hotel.
When we arrived, we were quickly checked in. We were impressed when they put additional staff on the checkin desk. Our bags were brought to our room where we were given an overview of all electronic gadgets. 
Our room was stunning, it overlooked the gardens. It was spotless and well maintained.
The bed was huge. 
The bathroom was fab, we were so impressed with the TV in the mirror. Such a clever idea.
We had dinner in Sika restaurant on the Friday night, it was a fantastic experience. We were introduced to server who would be looking after us for the night, we didn't see too much of her. But the other wait staff looked after us nicely.
Our breakfast on the last morning was so disappointing, we ordered Eggs Benedict. After over 25 mins and after other guest had received theirs, even though the ordered after us the hostess in the restaurant asked us if we were ok, we reminded of our order. She said she would check on it. She never came back to us. She actually quiet deliberately didn't make eye contact with us. After another 20 mins, they arrived Cold. We informed the server, he apologised profusely and offered to replace but at this stage we had enough of waiting. 
On checkout I informed reception, she apologised and offered for the manager to call me. I presume to apologise again. At no time was the price of the breakfast offered to be removed. 
I paid 5 star price, the amenities were but the service definitely wasn't at times.",4,2014,05,11
217,A blissful stay away!,"The moment I arrived at the powerscourt hotel I was taken back by the stunning scenery, I was greeted at the door and welcomed by the staff. I was checked in by a very helpful lady called Jayne, the check in was very quick. Once shown to our room we dinned in the sugar loaf lounge. The food was absolutely delicious!! Then had drinks in mc gills bar which was great Craic. What really impressed me the most about my stay was the spa. Never in all my life have I had a massage as great as the one I had from chayanit. She was so polite and has magical hands! I'm a total diva when it comes to massages and don't praise often! The staff made my stay worth every penny! Alison on the phone, the manager Kelly Ann even checked in with us! I cannot wait to go back! And would recommend the hotel and especially the spa to everyone! ☺️",5,2014,05,10
217,Very disappointed  ,"I stayed it this hotel last year and booked it as the 'Ritz Carlton'. We arrived to find it was no longer the Ritz. It had changed hands a week or so after booking. No one thought to let us know. We enquired about the 'games room' during the booking as we liked the idea of taking our two young children there during our two night break. We were really excited and had booked a family suite. We arrived a bit bemused as it had changed names and then brought to our room to find a camp bed with our double bed. This would have been fine for one child so we asked for another and it was brought up and squeezed awkwardly into the room after rearranging furniture. We thought 'ok let's just get on with it'. We unpacked and went off to explore the games room. It was closed due to 'refurbishment' for our whole stay. I couldn't believe it. I let the hotel know how disappointed I was and they said they would bring the games to our room. They brought a broken connect four set and a ludo game with half the pieces missing. It was very difficult to keep the children entertained. I wouldn't have came here if they had thought to inform us. Our little girls burger was pink inside on our second evening. I don't know if this was the reason but she vomited repeatedly all that night. We were exhausted. Our whole stay was a shambles from start to end. I was furious as we had spent a lot of money and chose this hotel over the Shelbourne for a change. An article was printed the following weekend in the Sunday times about the new CEO and with his name to hand, I put pen to paper and eloquently and politely explained our story and it made me feel better. I posted the letter and never had any response. I private messaged the hotel's Facebook page months later to ask why I had no reply hoping for an explanation. I was asked for my email address which I gave and still nothing. Very disappointed indeed!",1,2014,05,09
217,Stunning location.,"The Powerscourt Hotel is situated in the Powerscourt Estate,which is an historic and large former home of the De Poer family, going back centuries. The Hotel was built at huge expense during the crazy boom times of Ireland's Celtic Tiger,and was run by the Ritz Carlton Group. Many felt somewhat intimidated by the formality and grandeur of the place,feeling that this was really a ""City"" hotel out in the countryside of the Wicklow hills, and close to the scenic village of Enniskerry, a place to wear a suit and tie, and not country clothing. However, as with so many grand ventures, this one soon collapsed, as did the ultra smart Gordon Ramsay restaurant with its eye-watering prices, to be taken over by the Marriott Group, and renamed the Powerscourt Hotel. It is now a much more accessible venue,with charming staff, beautiful rooms with large bathrooms, and superb scenery,in the Garden of Ireland, lovely place to visit even if you are not staying there. A word of warning, however; a recent visit to the on-site pub, the food was very poor, the place was dark and seemed shabby, and the service was amateurish, definitely not worthy of a 5 Star hotel. Perhaps it has improved, following complaints to the obliging and attentive management.",4,2014,05,09
217,BEAUTIFUL HOTEL- JUST A FEW CHANGES TO MAKE IT PERFECT,"Myself , hubby and 14 year old daughter have just returned from a surprise stay at Powerscourt Hotel.
Fab suite on the 5th floor with amazing views of the mountains. We went to the Spa to use the pool and hamman- having stayed there previously I felt it now needs a bit of a revamp- lots of the lovely sparkling lights in the pool no longer work so you dont get the full effect. Also in the ladies changing rooms the showers are very very dark and its hard to tell the shampoo from the body wash due to bad lighting , one shower room had no lights working in it at all.
We were booked in for dinner in the restaurant which I have to say was the highlight of the stay for me with excellent food served by a very knowledgeable waiter by the name of Mark. He was really lovely and knew all about the various choices on the menu. A great plus if its your first time to taste certain foods. Definately worth having a meal in the restaurant a little bit dearer price wise but worth it.
We went to McGills for a few drinks and were surprised at the price of the drinks, it is a 5 star hotel but the prices could be a bit more realistic 11 euro for a vodka and 7up and 6.80 euro for a bottle of Corona - you wouldnt be having too many at that price.  It has a lovely atmosphere in it though.
Breakfast was lovely but really busy, more staff needed to turnover food and tables.
The stay was really lovely and  I would recommend it to anyone who gets a chance to stay there to do it- only sorry I wasnt staying another night - next time maybe!
My daughter loved the hotel and all the facilities too and we have promised ourselves when we get back to stay the next time to book some of the spa treatments in advance.",4,2014,05,05
217,"Good bye Powerscourt, we'll be back!","Just checked out of the Powerscourt Hotel. We booked in for our wedding anniversary. The staff were excellent. Upon arrival they upgraded our room to an amazing suite- a big thank you for that!

The Spa was fabulous, although very busy this weekend. 

We had a meal in the Sika restaurant. Our waiter Mark was excellent, great recommendations and really knew his wine. My husband was impressed as he is a wine exporter and enjoys trying new things. The food was delicious. I had the lamb and my husband had the beef. We live quite close by so I would definitely come back for the food alone.

Overall this was a great couples experience. Considering the hotel does not offer family specials, I was surprised at the number of families staying here enjoying the facilities. I felt a bit guilty as we had left our children with their grandparents for the night ;) the recession must be well and truly over!

A few points for constructive feedback:

Paint on swimming pool roof was peeling quite badly. Needs attention.

Electric curtains in room 701 are broken, off the rails. Iron also didn't work. The half bottle of Chablis in the fridge was a 2009 vintage and would not be drinkable at this stage.  1st world problems! 

One other small thing, €9.50 for a Gordon's gin and tonic in McGills bar is very pricey. If it was slightly cheaper, we would have had more!

Overall it was an excellent weekend and we'd love to come back!! ",5,2014,05,05
217,Amazing!,"My husband and I stayed here on our honeymoon. We based here and traveled around the country every day. I was overly impressed, everyone was so friendly and the free breakfast in the morning is amazing. Fresh, Irish food. We are and drank at the pub there, McGills, a few times, which was lovely. I Highly recommend staying here. ",5,2014,05,05
217,Beutiful,"Is a perfect balance between comfort and luxe, very peaceful place to rest and forget about everything, the facilities are  huge and comfortable , you can spend time in a little Irish Pub into the hotel that looks like an antique Irish pub, the hotel attention is excellent. Walking around you can find beautiful gardens and amazing landscapes.

Es un perfecto balance entre lujo y comodidad, un lugar muy tranquilo para descansar y olvidarte de todo, las instalaciones son grandes y confortables, el hotel cuenta con un pequeño bar típico irlandés que lo hicieron parecer antiguo con muy bonita decoración, caminando puedes ver hermosos jardines y disfrutar de muy bonitos paisajes naturales",5,2014,04,30
217,One of the best hotels ever----,"You have to experience it to appreciate it.  About 30 miles SW of Dublin - changed from Ritz Carlton to Powerscourt last September.  Huge rooms, beautiful lobby, great restaurants. Staff was wonderful, rooms were spotless.  Beds were awesome. The village of Enniskerry is very picturesque, with lots of small places to have breakfast and dinner.  Hotel can arrange taxis to Dublin (do not drive) for E40.  We had a car and toured the coast, but when we went to Dublin we took a cab. Highly recommend that. The Powerscourt House and Gardens are attached to the hotel. Simply beautiful. Highly recommend.",5,2014,04,28
217,Luxury I didn't expect,"For our first trip to Ireland, my wife & I decided to homebase ourselves and do daytrips to see a number of attractions.  We thought, ""heck Ireland's not so big, we can drive anywhere we want and return easily""  Well, that was a bit of presumption, but that's another story altogether.  On to the hotel.

As noted above, this used to be a Ritz-Carlton property, and as such it was beautifully appointed, very clean throughout, and staffed by attentive and friendly employees.  We knew from research online that it was likely to be a very nice place, but we didn't expect to have such luxurious accommodations.  Our room wasn't even one of the high-end ones, no suite or anything, and yet it was furnished with a very comfortable king bed, all-marble bath, nice coffee bar, walk-in closet, and huge windows.

Like lawrry's review from March, we also had an all-inclusive package from Groupon that included the airfare, car, and the room, so I'm sure we didn't pay full-rate.  In fact I haven't looked at their normal booking prices, but I would still recommend this hotel to anyone, even without knowing what that price might be.  It's just that nice.

We didn't take advantage of much of the hotel's offerings.  Didn't use the spa, the pool, didn't play golf, and only ate once in their on-site pub, McGill's.  Because we were more interested in experiencing Ireland close-up, we ate breakfast and dinner elsewhere most of the time, interacting with the locals as much as we could.  Had we intended to use the hotel as our destination and not simply as sleeping quarters, I'm sure we would have been just as delighted, and would no doubt have taken full advantage of their amenities.

My bottom line:  Wonderful place, located far enough away from Dublin to not get tangled up in their traffic, yet close enough to run into town (or elsewhere) for whatever sights or excursions in Eastern or Central Ireland you might care for.",5,2014,04,28
217,A night away with spa treatments,"Myself and my partner booked into Powerscourt Hotel for the night just to break up the long weekend and found the staff and hotel amazing.  The staff could not have been more accommodating and friendly.  It was easter weekend and they had a pen with real bunnies and guinea pigs in it which I thought was a lovely touch.  

The facilities were great as well and the gym fully equipped. 

The real highlight of the stay was the use of the Spa and our treatments, we both had massages and they were the best both of us had ever had, I also had a facial which made me feel so refreshed after. The spa and staff were second to none. 

We will be back for sure and would recommend this hotel to anyone.  the room was spacious and plush. Even though we were only 20 minutes from home we felt we were in the countryside. 

Amazing",5,2014,04,28
217,"Stunning property, special experience","My daughter and I stayed here for two days as we concluded our trip to Ireland.  What a way to end our trip!  This hotel is absolutely beautiful - one of the prettiest places I've seen.  The grounds are perfect for walking and there are so many opportunities to take beautiful pictures.  We were upgraded to a suite and, seriously, the room was bigger than most apartments - dining room, living room, kitchen - HUGE bathroom - it was phenomenal.  So was our view.  The staff was extremely friendly and helpful as well.  The one slight negative I'd say is that the spa treatments my daughter and I had (mani/pedi and swedish massages) were not up to par.  The mani-pedis were a little messy and the massages were just so-so.  But overall a fantastic place to stay - and not too far from Dublin.",5,2014,04,27
217,Can't beat the level of comfort,"Stayed here late March for 6 nights. Excellent facilities just like what you would expect from a Ritz Carlton. We are lucky as we had a Groupon package (w/ fight, hotel and rental car) so we didn't pay the full price.

The breakfast buffet is unreal. Everything is top quality (even the milk and sugar). 

Do make sure you save time for the swimming pool (indoor). It is a beautiful pool and the hot tub is awesome. I went there an hour before closing and I had the place all by myself. 

If you want to avoid expensive meals you can drive 5 min to Enniskerry for some really good choices or another 15 min to Bray and the international crusine is right in front of your eyes. Tesco supermarket is a bit of a drive if you want to go super cheap.",5,2014,04,25
217,Lovely hotel but not 5 star,"Firstly we really enjoyed our stay here last weekend but there were good points and some not so good. The positives were the staff were very nice and helpful, food in the sugar loaf lounge was pretty good and the bedroom was very nice room. The grounds are very nice and the walks around Enniskerry are lovely. The main negative was the breakfast which was very very poor for a five star hotel. I have had a lot better breakfasts in 2 star places with the hot food pretty basic and only buffet with no omlettes etc on offer. The rest of the selection was very poor like breads, fruit, yogurts etc and the cereals and porridge was terrible. Also the mini bar in the room was ridiculous; €5 for a bottle of water. This is not 5 star any more in my opinion but still a nice place for a weekend away if the package is right.",3,2014,04,25
217,Exquisite stay!,"Our stay was a wedding gift from friends... what a gift it turned out to be!  This is a stunning hotel in a very beautiful setting.  Our room was the nicest we've encountered (and we've stayed in some great hotels) - very spacious, a huge bathroom and the fancy bed and bowl for the dog made us laugh - he got the five star treatment as well!  We had a guide dog, but their general pet-friendly policy is very impressive - and it was lovely to see other guests with pets. The lobby is gorgeous, with fireside sofas. Breakfast was top notch - extensive buffet and lovely items to order also.  Service was great - everyone we dealt with was so warm and welcoming and looked after us so well, yet not intrusive or overpowering as can be the case in some five star hotels.  We ate in the bar, but are looking forward to trying out the fine dining restaurant next time.  Time also didn't allow a visit to the spa.... a great excuse to go back!",5,2014,04,24
217,"Poor Reception, NOT five star","5 star property, at best 4 star service. Stunning property with great amenities, but very poor staff training and certainly not up to 5 star standard.  On arrival we were not offered any information about facilities or restaurants until we asked - left to find room ourselves without any assistance for luggage. The room was large, spotlessly clean and very well appointed - probably the best thing about our stay. Several areas had clearly not been vacuumed for days: around reception, outside the Sika restaurant and in the spa reception area. The cooked items at the breakfast buffet were served luke warm, as was the coffee. Again waiting staff at breakfast were not trained to five star standard.
On the outside, the building needs attention, definately ready for a paint. Guest car parks are being used by staff. Why put a staff smoking area right next to a guest car park?

In summary: the management are depending on the impressive building to cover up for poor training.",2,2014,04,24
217,Beautiful views ,"Had a wonderful stay here over the Easter break.  The hotel even had two resident rabbits and a couple of gerbils in the lobby which were brought in especially for the weekend- my inner child loved it! 

Rooms are fabulous - a large super comfy king sized bed and huge bathroom with double sinks, large bath and separate shower. They also have touchscreen technology to adjust the aircon or turn on/ off the lights, which was pretty cool. A few nitpicks were 1. The charges for a movie or to listen to music were extortionate- €11.50 for a movie, even movies a few years old and €5.50 to listen to an album, and worse there was no MTV or similar music channels on the TV.  2. I was initially so excited by the iPhone  docking station beside the bed, until I realised it didn't work with the iPhone 5! Probably Apple's  fault, rather than the hotel's, but still!!

The hotel is located on powerscourt estate in Wicklow, the garden of Ireland and the views of the mountains, forest and lakes from the hotel are simply stunning.  There are fabulous runs, walks and hikes that start right from the hotel - a great way to pass a few hours, or the whole day.

In inclement weather, there's a good spa onsite, as well as a pool and hammam suite. We popped down to  the pool in the early evening on a bank holiday weekend and it was overrun with kids... their excited screams exacerbated by a low roof, so best avoided til later.

The sugar loaf lounge is a charming space for a few cocktails, a bite to eat or afternoon tea. The floor to ceiling windows overlook sugar loaf mountain- very scenic and romantic. 

Food in the hotel restaurants is very good and pricey, as you would expect in a five star hotel. Service is impeccable and the staff are happy and pleasant.

Breakfast is disappointing for a hotel of this quality. Anywhere else, I would be happy with a buffet style breakfast of this type, but having experienced the vast range and quality of the breakfast offering of similar five star hotels, it simply just doesn't compare.

Overall, I would definitely stay again- the luxurious surroundings and views of this hotel are hard to beat.",4,2014,04,23
217,Magnificent hotel in scenic Enniskerry,"I stayed here for a Conference. 
The hotel is located in a very picturesque part of Ireland, close by the Sugerloaf mountain, Powerscourt waterfall and the quaint village of Enniskerry. The hotel is finished to the highest standard and even though it has been recently built it does not look out of place on this historic estate.
The lobby is spacious and very well finished, the bedroom I was given was to the highest standard with impressive use of technology and comfort. The food at the Conference dinner was also very impressive as was the lunch and snacks which were served throughout the event. The breakfast was served in the main dining room overlooking the gardens and the selection was impressive.
Overall the facilities were superb as was the view. The service was very good but could have been better. When I requested a private dining option over breakfast for some VIP guests I was told no and had to ask three times to get some other options. I did not feel that this was 5 star service, but this is the only criticism I would have.",4,2014,04,21
217,Amazing,"Stayed at the hotel on 18th April for one night. It was only when we were shown to our room that we realised we were upgraded to a suite. It was out of this world, a huge luxurious room. However I'm sure all the rooms are of the same high quality. The pool was so beautiful, very zen like. We had a gorgeous meal in the Sika restaurant. The taste and presentation of the food was excellent. The wine list was excellent, but I felt that by having only 1 bottle to choose from at your starter price of €36.00 was disappointing. Service was excellent overall, maybe just a little slow at the lounge areas by the fires. I felt at times we were forgotten about. Overall a fabulous stay, and will definitely return in the winter.",4,2014,04,21
217,Enniskerry Excellence,"Stayed for 2 nights 16 and 17 April 2014. The hotel is very well situated on the Powerscourt estate, with the house and fantastic gardens a short stroll away and adjoining two championship golf courses. We were allocated a room on the fifth floor with a fantastic view of the Sugarloaf mountain. The room was spacious, comfortable, well presented giving a feeling of indulgent luxury. (Yes the TV screen in the bathroom mirror is amazing)  The attention to detail continued throughout all areas of the hotel.Very impressive. All the staff we came in contact with were professional, looked smart and were very helpful. We struggled to find anything that could attract criticism.  We have stayed in a number of top hotels around the world and consider this to be one of the best. ",5,2014,04,18
217,Amazing place -exceptional staff,"Powerscourt is the most amazing estate with gorgeous views from the hotel. Could not fault anything about it. The rooms are comfortable and luxurious, yet homely and welcoming. Outstanding for me were the staff, especially in Reception. Nothing but nothing was too much trouble for anyone.  Special mention for the complimentary bikes, fantastic place to explore by bike. Also don't miss going down to explore the village.",5,2014,04,18
217,Amazing!,"This is one truly amazing hotel. The staff and service was outstanding. We booked a standard room and was pleasantly surprised to an upgraded to a superior mountain view room. Loved the tv in the mirror in the bathroom, electric curtains and lights & the view - it certainly ticks all the boxes and more. Without a doubt I'll be back, don't book anywhere else! ",5,2014,04,16
217,Beautiful hotel in stunning surroundings,"Stayed at the hotel for two nights. Without even asking we were upgraded to a Mountain View room and quite stunning it was. Probably the biggest bed I have ever seen with a great view of the Wicklow mountains. Couldn't fault the hotel or the staff and my wife thought the spa was one of the nicest she has seen. Although the hotel is set in a country setting it is only a short drive to the seaside town of Bray, which is on the DART line, making for easy travel into Dublin. If you just want to walk then the hotel is right in the grounds of the Powerscourt estate, and right next to the golf course.",5,2014,04,15
217,Execellent conference hotel,"First of all, I was wondering the location of the hotel, but when arrived after 40 min. taxi drive I was amazed of the great views and peacefulness of the area. Hotel itself was excellent, very stylish and at the same time cosy. 

My room was in lobby level and had perfect living room and bed room added with spacious bath room. There was also integrated TV in the mirror of bath room. Views from the room was spectacular.

The staff was very friendly, only thing where I was expecting more friendly service was related to dinner service. Breakfast was covering all possible needs and the atmosphere was relax and inspiring.

Conference facilities was very good for large conferences and easily accessible from hotel.

This hotel is in my top 3 of visited hotels in Europe!",4,2014,04,15
217,"Beautiful, relaxing stay","My partner and I stayed for two weekend nights in the executive suite. On arrival check-in was prompt. The staff dropped our car to the car park and our bags to our room. 
When we arrived to our room, there was a set of scones waiting for us which was welcomed after a long drive from Cork. The room was magnificent. Spacious, comfortable with beautiful views of the surrounding mountains. The bathroom had both a bath and a shower with a television built-in to vanity area. The beds were extremely comfortable and the temperature of the room was about right.
The food was of high quality and the lobby area of the hotel was one of the most relaxing I have been in. Throughout our stay the staff were polite and always on hand without being overly intrusive. 
We took the long river walk and despite the inclement weather really enjoyed it. You need to get a pass from reception to get through the gates. 
We loved our stay here and plan to visit again in the winter. A brilliant place to unwind and switch off for a weekend.",5,2014,04,14
217,Dogs Welcome!,"My first holiday with my mommies convinced me that this travelling lark is not as bad as my car sickness would indicate. 

On arrival my mom's were upgraded to a top floor suite for their anniversary, a huge surprise to them, but not to me. I'd been to the dog groomer just an hour or two before our arrival, and the effects of my CK9 (Calvin Klein) perfume must have convinced the lady at check-in that I am one posh pooch. Hence the upgrade!?

As I was reassured that I could go anywhere in the hotel except for the restaurants and spa areas I immediately felt welcome and relaxed. I was pleasantly surprised that a special little chair and feeding bowls were placed in our suite for my enjoyment and I immediately tried it on for size. Unsurprisingly... a perfect fit!

Afternoon tea was served in the lobby and from the mutterings above me, the delicacies were going down a storm, especially the lemon curd! I settled under the table, where I surveyed my surroundings and as my K9 academy training demanded, I kept very quiet and out of sight.

However, on our way to the fabulously manicured gardens outside, I could not hide my tail wag delight at the adoration from passersby. The gardens outside afforded me a lovely leg stretch and I really enjoyed what the groundsman and gardener had done with the place. Really a dog's paradise. 

I had a fabulous night's rest! All in all 2 paws up and a tail wag approval for this hotel and their kindness and generosity when it comes to four legged guests. 

Highly recommended and I will be sure to give this hotel a mention, at my next neighbourhood watch dogwalk meeting. 

Your sincerely 
Bow wow",5,2014,04,13
217,What an excellent hotel,"We have stayed at this hotel on numerous occasions when it was under the Ritz Carlton group and I was slightly concerned when booking this time around without the prestigious name but thankfully nothing much has changed. 
Great service and a still a beautiful hotel. 
The staff are out of this world and just so helpful and friendly from front end reception staff to the guys in the Silka restaurant especially with my almost 2 year old daughter. 

We booked in on a spa deal which is highly recommended. Anytime we stay here we would always get a spa package so are quite familiar with the Espa Spa. 
The staff are very friendly and helpful. Pity the gents jacuzzi want working, I could have done with a half hour in it. 

We got a very special and very kind upgrade to one of the 4 beautiful powerscout suites and I have to say this was some room. I have to thank the reservations manageress for this. It was bigger than my own apartment, beautifully decorated, spotlessly clean and just out of this world. We just didn't want to leave. 

We had dinner in the new Silka restaurant. Beautiful food and great service and Very attentive staff. Our little girl got a little restless during dinner and the waiter offered to take her off for a tour of the kitchen so that we could enjoy the rest of our dinner. 
A manager also brought over some cookies to keep her amused which was a great help. 

We can't wait to return to the hotel again even if it is just for a drink or a bite to eat. 

Thanks for another memorable stay. ",5,2014,04,13
217,It's heaven on earth!!!,I have stayed at a lot of places in my lifetime.  Powerscourt Hotel is the BEST!!!!!   The rooms are luxurious and roomy.  The grounds are impeccably kept as is everything at this hotel.   The staff was always kind and helpful!!   You can't go wrong staying here while in Ireland!!!,5,2014,04,13
217,Fantastic Expierience,"Fantastic place to stay. We are already planning a trip back. The staff were very friendly, great food. The hotel has fantastic grounds so make the most of them. I recommend spending as much time in the hotel as possible to get the value. No need to leave the hotel. The pool and leisure area is fantastic.",5,2014,04,11
217,Day Spa Trip - disappointing,"Came to The Spa to celebrate our wedding anniversary. Both had massages which were excellent.  The Hammam steam room was being cleaned when we arrived and continued to be unavailable the whole time we were there. The area around the pool was also being cleaned while we were there. After our massages and some time in the relaxation room, we went to the steam and sauna rooms only to discover that they were both switched off. I had to go downstairs to reception to ask for them to be turned on. Rooms looked neglected and needed to be cleaned. Mid-week but there was no atmosphere. Lunch in the spa cafe is located in the spa reception, no atmosphere. Food good but portions extremely small.   Overall, a disappointing experience for a special occasion. ",3,2014,04,10
217,Excellent,"Wife and I stayed here for 5 nights and had a great experience.  The accommodations were great, the staff were very helpful and attentive, the food was wonderful and the grounds around the hotel, Powerscourt House and Gardens, and the golf course were immaculate!  Ask for a room that has a window you can open to let the cool night air in - our temp control did not go as low as we would like.  Great place for walkers/hikers and the town of Enniskerry is just down the hill from the hotel - neat little shops, pubs, and eateries.  Would definitely stay here again.",5,2014,04,09
217,Good but not great,I have been here several times when it was the ritz and you can tell the difference. Still a stunning hotel but subtle differences are there. Food is way down in quality. Had dinner in the restaurant and the goats cheese was the worst I have ever tasted. The staff messed up booking and we had to eat at 6.15pm. At breakfast the cooked breakfast was like it had been steamed. It was cold and the plates were cold. Rooms are as good as ever and I was pleased the spa was as good as before. Couldn't get table for lunch when we arrived at 3pm on sat. All they could suggest was an offer of a bus into the local town or a bite in the pub which was a joke. Got some room service and the salmon was as bland as you can get. Lovely hotel but get the food back some way to what it was...,4,2014,04,08
217,A magical destination,"This hotel is off the beaten path, about 30 minutes outside of Dublin.  The grounds are stunning and prime for relaxed walks in the Irish countryside.  This property also has a world class golf course, and a castle-turned-shopping complex just down the road.  It also connects to the Powerscourt home/castle gardens which are amazing.  The hotel itself is well appointed.  Our room, 607, was very large, suite-like with a patio you could sit on - facing the parking lot, but still a great view.  There is a labyrinth to walk around and use for meditation.  The spa was one of the best, and their swimming pool was dark, sparkly, quiet and elegant.  This location has a kids play room, but was not being used while we were there.  Be aware this hotel does not have a gift shop or convenience shop, so if you need something like emergency cookies or sodas, there is no place to get them, other than walk to the town, or to the small shops on the other property during business hours.  There are NO coffee makers in the rooms, but a hot water pot and instant coffee & tea bags.  That was an inconvenience, as we like coffee before heading out for the day's events.  Also, be aware there is only a bottom sheet on the bed, with a feather-like duvet cover - no top sheet!  So, if you are too warm, there is no option to remain lightly covered if you kick off the duvet.

We were part of a large group at the hotel.  One day, our room service came so late we couldn't eat it before our appointed outing, so we saved the yogurt and fruit in the mini-fridge (which is stocked by the way - for purchase) but when we came back in the afternoon, housekeeping took these items out of the fridge and took them away.  The entertainment in the Pub didn't start on time - in fact they were almost an hour late getting started and with a 10 p.m. original start time - it was too late for us to enjoy the group.  But - this is a spectacular place.  I'd go back in a heart beat.  Spa services are excellent.",4,2014,04,07
217,Wonderful couple of days,"My husband and I received a gift  from our two daughters of a 2night stay in this beautiful hotel. From the moment we arrived on Monday til we checked out on Wednesday, we were treated  wonderfully by all the staff.  Every member of staff, from the young man who carried our bags  to the General Manager who sat and chatted to us while we relaxed by the fire in the lobby made us feel so welcome. The food was excellent and can honestly say we couldnt find fault with anything..we definitely intend returning!!!!!!!",5,2014,04,06
217,Great location for relaxing break,"This is a lovely hotel located near Powerscourt House and Gardens.

This was a one night break on Marriott points.  Our room was large and wonderful.  Really well appointed, they have the same furnishings as when the property was a Ritz Carlton.

The restaurant was booked out so we reserved a table for the lounge behind the lobby.  Before dinner we headed to the bar for a drink.  Bar staff were good and drinks were normal Dublin prices (ie quite expensive).  We had potato skins to accompany our drinks...I prefer potato skins to be crispy...these were made with new potatoes and were not crispy.

Dinner was excellent with one exception-I had a steak that was very tough.  Other then that we enjoyed dinner and a few cocktails.  Not eating in the restaurant was no big deal for us but next time we stay we will book ahead to sample the food downstairs.

Breakfast was a superb buffet and the helpful host researched walking options and retrieved a map while we ate.  Initially unsure if my marriott status conferred free breakfast this was quickly confirmed.

Make sure you take the short walk down to the house and gardens while you are there, the tea room overlooking the garden offers an alternative to breakfast or lunch at the hotel.

Overall a very pleasant stay, this would have been five stars only for the tough steak, I would recommend this hotel for an upscale getaway break a short drive from Dublin.",4,2014,04,06
217,Second Honeymoon,"My husband and I traveled from Colorado on our first trip to Ireland and we had the most wonderful experience at this hotel.  We had bought a package deal and stayed at the Powerscourt Hotel for 5 nights before moving on.  Wow is all I can say.  The staff was very welcoming and the hotel itself was amazing.  We upgraded to a suite and we were not disappointed.  We ate at the hotel on site, ordered room service, and drank at the bar on site.  All were wonderful.  We felt pampered and appreciated the entire time.  After a long day of travel, you will look forward to relaxing at this luxury, and it is luxury. We will reminisce on our trip to Ireland in years to come.  Thank you!",5,2014,04,03
217,Great weekend stay,"You get what you pay for. It is an expensive weekend away so you expect luxury and first class service. We experience all of that. The ESPA spa is luxurious and very relaxing, the lunch and dinner experience in the Sugar Loaf Lounge was very good. One thing I would like to highlight is the excellent customer service from Shane in the Sugar Loaf Lounge. I wish staff in restaurants and hotels we visit were so friendly and professional as Shane. Although it might sound a bit weird but he made the dinner experience just a bit better.",5,2014,04,02
217,Spa day,"Myself and my mother went to the ESPA spa for the day on the weekend. From the moment we arrived, we were very impressed with the level of luxury both in the hotel and in the spa. We started our day with coffee and scones in the lobby after which we lay around the pool for a couple of hours, either reading or enjoying the facilities. 

The pool area is a great size and the low lighting gives a nice sense of privacy. We enjoyed a delicious light lunch and moved upstairs to the thermal suites for an hour or so before our treatments. I had a half hour hot stone message followed by an hour long facial. It was by far the best ESPA facial I've ever had. The therapist remained silent throughout the facial, only explaining the products she used afterwards. I have had ESPA facials where the therapist talk throughout the treatment about the products which really interferes with the process. We spent the entire day in the spa and there was no one rushing us to leave which was great. All in all, it's the best spa I have been to. I hope next time I am there I am lucky enough to stay in the hotel! ",5,2014,03,31
217,40th Birthday Break.,"We stayed on Saturday night and were greeted by some very friendly and helpful staff at the door and reception. At check in we were shown to our large Superior room which was immaculate and extremely well appointed with a sitting room, Kingsize bed and beautiful bathroom.

The hotel is in a stunning setting in the large Powerscourt gardens overlooking the Sugarloaf Mountain.

We used the very tranquil spa in the afternoon before we paid a visit to McGill's bar in the evening where we also enjoyed a lovely meal in the lively atmosphere.

The following morning we had a beautiful buffet breakfast where the choices of food seemed to be endless.

We would like to thank the management and staff for making this such a memorable stay for myself and my wife. 

We would have no hesitation in recommending The Powerscourt Hotel to anyone.

 ",5,2014,03,31
217,Very nice,"Just returned from a two night break at this lovely hotel. The hotel is in great condition considering it went through a take over from Marriott group - we enjoyed the food, the atmosphere, the staff were helpful and friendly and my daughter just loved running around the place both inside and outside! the grounds are lovely also. Only downside was that after a wait for the games room to open (it was raining so were looking for alternative for our energetic three year old), as we entered we could see that the ceiling collapsed (probably from burst bathroom pipe) and smelled of urine, suffice to stay we couldn't take our little girl in here to play. In addition we requested an extra cot for our room three times, we had to ring reception twice and my husband had to go to the desk eventually to request it. So these were our two 'blips'.....",4,2014,03,30
217,Mothers birthday treat!,"My mother sister and I had a wonderful experience in feb to celebrate her 80+ birthday , 
Everything about the trip was superb
The checking was done with ease and very welcoming.
We enjoyed the facilities of the spa 
Had beautiful food in the lobby enjoying the view of the sugar loaf.
The whole experience was wonderful. Many thanks to housekeeping supervisor for his help

217,One night in Powerscourt,"We stayed here for one night in a suite.
Absolutely amazing room...electric curtains!

The staff are great.

Walked around the grounds and gardens.  Well worth a visit.
We had a dinner malfunction and the Manager sorted it out quickly and took the dinner cost of the bill.
I will return .",5,2014,03,30
217,Family Get away - spoilt rotten!,"We decided to take a trip to Powerscourt hotel for my Father in Laws 60th Birthday. We booked in for 3 rooms and dinner on the Saturday night. 

On arrival we were welcomed by helpful porters and didn't have to think about our baggage again. We were checked in and escorted to our rooms - all located quite close together which is nice when you are a small group. The porter explained everything from turning on the lights to operating the shower's as well as the TV in the bathroom. Which caused great excitement. 

As we had arrived early we went for lunch in the Irish themed Bar. The menu serving snacks and lunch sandwiches suited us perfect, however my mother in law had her heart set on afternoon tea / scones, to which the obliged to bring to her in the bar there also. 

Our dinner was booked for 8 so we decided on a pre dinner drink in the bar, with lovely views from the lobby where better to have a pre dinner cocktail. Delightful cocktail menu and some PInt's for the boys. 

Dinner menu did confuse us a little (showing our ignorance) we were assisted by the helpful waiting staff with any questions we had on what the words meant. We all had different starters and mains so was nice to compare what we were all having. Staff were very helpful and even though there was apparently a delay in our main courses we hadnt noticed as we were enjoying the wine and company. 

Unfortunately when we went back to our room the Air conditioning was on full blast and had broken, reception immediately sent someone up and moved us to a new room. Normally when something like this has happened, something faulty in the room there was no offer of moving room but this was their first solution. Nice to be cared for first and fix the problem later. They even informed us the room would be put out of commission now so that no one else would have this problem. 

My favorite part of staying in a hotel is breakfast. Having breakfast handed to you is one of the small joys in life! And the breakfast did not disappoint. With 2 options of where to eat, we decided on the lobby bar for breakfast with the big comfy chairs and lovely views. The buffet was stocked with fresh fruits, yogurts, muesli and cereals and plenty of juices to choose from. Thats' only for start. The hot food buffet was also amply stocked and fresh food was coming from the kitchen the whole time. So as we sat we helped ourselves to 2nd's (and maybe 3rd's) with plenty of fresh tea and coffee being offered to us throughout. 

All round a lovely experience and well worth it for the celebration. We will certainly return.

My only regret is not booking into the spa for a treatment or even bringing my togs to avail of the pool. Next time for sure!",5,2014,03,30
217,Great way to see Ireland!,"Although a distance from Dublin, the resort is in a beautiful country setting with trails and ancient buildings- the grounds were splendid and the views of the Wicklow Mtns. were fabulous! The greeting on arrival was warm, friendly and efficient. The Sunday brunch was good and a nice welcome for a jet lagged group!
The bellboy was nice and explained all the details/ specifics of the room to us. Our room was clean and bright - housekeeping kept it that way our entire stay. Sit by the lobby fires and have a drink and relax. Great spa/ pool - bring your swimwear! A HUGE plus is the pub - McGills! Good food, nice beer selection, live Irish music on Friday nights and a great group of people running/working there! Ian, Ross and Amie were the best and keep the pub running along- even on very busy nights!
The nearby town on Enniskerry is charming and quaint. Loved Poppies for brunch/lunch and Emilia's for dinner. 
Would go back in a 'heartbeat'.",5,2014,03,29
217,Amazing Stay-Thank you Powerscourt!,"When my wife and I decided to take a short break away from the children we really wanted to go somewhere special. We had heard so much about the Powerscourt Hotel and we really did wanted to try it out.

From the moment we arrived we felt special. Stunning hotel! 
Our bedroom was huge with an amazing view of the sugar loaf mountain.

My wife wanted to get some spa treatments and was so impressed with her hot stone massage. I had a long walk around the grounds and the staff were great with directions.

We wanted to eat in the restaurant on our first night but unfortunately it was full-so we had a few drinks and some fish n chips in McGills pub.It was perfect. Felt like we were in a small pub in the Wicklow mountains.

Breakfast the next morning was pretty busy but plenty of food on display and really tasty.

We had lunch in the sugarloaf lounge with another stunning view. I had calamari and my wife had goats cheese salad-both lovely.

That night we were lucky enough to eat the the main restaurant-service and food was fantastic. Our waiter was so nice and had great knowledge of the wines they had and gave us great recommendations to go with our food.

All in all we had an amazing stay and will definitely return-next time with the kids. 
Thanks you Powerscourt!!!",5,2014,03,29
217,Nice place to relax,"I was staying in this hotel for 2 days due to business meeting.  It's little bit far from Dublin airport to reach this hotel.  It takes about 40-50 minutes to reach this hotel by taxi and I was paying about 100 EUR to get there (return way was just 75EUR).  

Reaching hotel it was really positive surprise.  Large building in very nice area, good service and great looking suite with own fireplace.  Hotel is convenient for business meetings but also I could imagine to spend here short holidays.  There is nice nature around, gardens, golf court, ideal place to make trips around and typical Irish village not faraway.  It's definitely nice place to relax.  

Having not car I was spending all time in hotel area and hotel was the only place to eat.  Cuisine is excellent and not really expensive for this type of hotel.  

True is that if I would not get information in front desk that this hotel is part of Ritz Carlton chain.  I've seen the logo only twice during this stay (last time on the invoice).  

I would be looking forward to come next time for weekend stays to explore more its area around.",5,2014,03,29
217,Nice hotel but NOT 5 Star,"The Powerscourt Hotel is a very nice hotel and we would definitely stay there again.  However, I do feel the hotel is misrepresented as a “Five Star” Hotel.  This hotel is no longer a Ritz Carlton and as someone who frequents Ritz Carlton, Four Seasons and other top hotels this one is lacking in several areas.

First let me discuss the good points.  The hotel is in an incredibly beautiful part of Ireland only a short distance from Dublin.  The hotel is fairly new, only 8 years and the hotel and rooms are very well appointed.  We were staying during offseason and were offered an upgrade to a suite at a very reasonable price.  This was nice, since we were traveling with our 9-year-old daughter.  The views from our room were incredible, the bed was comfortable, there was nice functional technology and the best part was the FREE wifi throughout the entire hotel with easy access, no passwords, etc.

Now, for the reason I would not categorize this hotel as a “Five Star.”  Clearly, there have been cuts to the staff.  There was a short but tolerable wait at check-in.  There was only one bell hop and no other door man.  This may not seem like an issue and it is not, as long as you are not expecting “Five Star” service.  

We had a few issues with our room, that I’ve not experienced at a Ritz or Four Seasons.  First, the trash in our powder bath did not get emptied for two days.  It seems like even though the hotel was not near capacity, the house keeping staff couldn’t keep up.  This was also evidenced with the fact our Kleenex did not get replaced for two days during our stay.

However, the most serious concern that affected my rating has to do with how the property was maintained.  Remember, this hotel is only 8 years old there were several things that surprised me.  The lawn chess set, sound like a nice idea but several of the pieces are missing.  Also, there was a broken lawn chair next to the lawn chess that remained for the entire stay.  If it is broken, have someone throw it away, because it is an eye sore.  There were also, several places where paint was pealing from the ceiling (see photos).  These are minor items, but again, not items acceptable at this caliber of hotel.

We will gladly return the Powerscourt Hotel, but I think it is important for people to understand what they are getting when they travel hear.  It is a very nice 3 star, maybe 4 star hotel.",3,2014,03,27
217,Good in Parts,"It was a significant anniversary so we decided to celebrate it staying at Powerscourt. 'Hmmm', I thought, ""mixed reviews on Tripadvisor"" but we decided to see for ourselves.  Well, it is a wonderful building in a beautiful environment but that's not the whole story, is it?  Initially as we walked in, we were greeted immediately and reception service was efficient. Then we had a little orientation chat about what's where in the hotel from the guy who took our bags up for us. So far so good. Then we discovered the reason for the chat - no information whatsoever in the room either about the hotel (not even meal times!) or about the surrounding area. Very strange, we thought. We had to ask subsequently at reception and were then given a small map of the estate primarily aimed at joggers. The room was lovely: very large with separate dressing area and a gorgeous bathroom, with lovely view to Sugar Loaf mountain.  Why, in a double room of great proportions would there be only one easy chair though? We'd both like to sit comfortably please, not fight over who gets the chair and who gets to sit on the footstool or the bed, or at the desk! Others have commented on the lighting which is truly dire: the fortunate person who bags the easy chair may get to read with the aid of the adjacent standard lamp.  Otherwise, forget it - and there are no lights to facilitate reading in bed. It's all very well for poor Paul to have to keep saying sorry, but it wears thin -why aren't customers listened to and something DONE on the basis of their feedback? Service was variable: some requests actioned immediately, some not until a further call was made to reception. The most disappointing aspect of our stay was dinner which  we had on our first night in the hotel. From a very limited, unexciting menu I had a starter of goat's cheese, beetroot etc followed by duck breast. Why, I wondered was there not a good selection of the fine local ingredients featuring on the menu?  The goat's cheese starter looked like a mess on a plate: too much goat's cheese (and I love it!), too little beetroot and appallingly badly presented.  My duck breast or, rather two slices of duck breast, was not cooked properly.  I wanted my meat pink, but the chef clearly did not know how to achieve this and to cook out the fat on the breast at the same time.  Elementary for any decent chef, and completely unacceptable in this situation. The fat was practically raw and inedible, and the portion was ridiculous.  My partner fared a little better with a quail starter and beef main course.  The saving grace of the meal was down to our choice of wine - a bottle of Paper Road Pinot Noir (try it at home for far less than the €44 it cost here!) -  but we agreed that this was a third rate meal and poor value for money.  Such a pity, because we would gladly have eaten in the hotel again had our experience been good.  As it was, Emilia's in Enniskerry (see my review), was the winner.  Now there's a postscript: on arrival home, my daughter rang me to say that she had phoned the hotel from England three times before our visit to arrange for a bottle of champagne to be put in our room as part of our celebration.  On each occasion she was told  'somebody will get back to you'.  They never did. How poor is that? NOT 5* methinks! Oh, and there was a card in our room congratulating us on our engagement - that was some time ago!  So to sum it all up: gorgeous hotel; beautiful setting; splendid spa; variable service and awful food. On balance, yes we'd stay here again but, no, we would not eat in the hotel despite the fact they had the good grace not to charge us for the execrable duck. Marriott need to get a grip on this place before it loses any reputation it once had - and please get Gordon back to sort out the kitchen nightmare!!",4,2014,03,27
217,Only for the room! Food was v disappointing,"Like the heading.  Only for the beautiful room we would have bailed out I think.  Hubby booked as a treat away as I am pregnant and have been ill.  We arrived early to get some lunch and make the most of our night away. However lunch was less than average. Very uninterested waitress, dirty glasses  and medicore prawn cocktail ans steak sandwich. Very disappointing.  But we were so excited at the thought of our evening meal in the restaurant ww scrapped it off.  But dinner was just as disappointing.  The fillet steak was well done as opposed to medium and no real taste.  The waiter was very pleasant but with the hype about this restaurant we were underwhelmed.  Also I am sorry but a buffet breakfast where you have to queue in a line for eggs is not acceptable for me in a 5 star hotel.  ",3,2014,03,27
217,Perfect!,"We stayed 6wks after the birth of our second baby and I can truly say it was perfect from start to finish, we have stayed in hotels all over the world, Dubai possibly being the best but this has to be on par with the service, food and ambience. On check in we where upgraded to a superior room and it was fab. Staff could not do enough for us. So I would seriously recommend this hotel to anyone and is close enough to Dublin for a tourist, hop on the bus and the hotel will happily pick you up in the hotel jeep! We had dinner in the village and we where dropped down and picked up within 5 mins of call. So if you want luxury this is the place to be. Regards , A very happy new mommy !",5,2014,03,26
217,tranquility just around the corner,"From the moment we walked in, we felt like we were walking into a small family run hotel. The staff are so friendly and helpful, nothing was too much trouble. We arrived looking to switch off for two nights and relax. The hotel was very busy but we still felt like we had our own space to enjoy and relax!! I highly recommend sitting down by the fire in the evening and enjoy an excellent guinness. That is if you can drag yourself away from the comfort of the room!! Make sure to go for a walk, try the spa (stress-buster recommended) and eat in Sika or just lock yourself in your room. Two nights was never enough",5,2014,03,25
217,Perfect place to relax,"My mum and I always try to come here for a girly weekend at least once a year. Its the perfect place to relax. Staff are very helpful and the scenery and atmosphere are perfect to unwind with. To anyone who needs a break, this is the place!",5,2014,03,23
217,Sheer indulgence!,"Myself and my girlfriend decided to stay here again (we visited 3 years ago) if anything the hotel has improved from our last wonderful stay. The grounds and surroundings are breathtaking, the rooms are luxurious and the service could not be faulted, they were friendly and attentive at every step but without being over bearing. My girlfriend loved the spa in particular, and has demanded a return visit! Basically we both felt very special and had an amazing two days. Thank you powers court!",5,2014,03,23
217,Disappointing,"As a lover of fancy hotels this was my first stay in Powerscourt. Overall I was just a little disappointed. The ESPA is fabulous and most definitely 5 star however everything else was a let down. Our first night away from our children in many years we booked a suite, the one we got looked out onto the wall of the carpark (€310pn!). We felt all the time under a compliment to some staff, for arranging us our room before 3pm (2pm) it was as if they were doing us a great deed, for 'fitting us' into their restaurant that only had 4 tables full at the time they managed to 'fit' us in. The chocolate bar in the room which cost €5 was best before 30Aug2013! This was on 21Mar2014!!!! Part of our experience was genuinely nice however lacking the little things that make you feel at home. No water in the rooms, no turndown service. A little deflated and out of pocket! Will run back to The Europe or lower grade hotels that provide a better experience.",3,2014,03,23
217,Powerscourt Hotel -  Five Stars all the Way,"We stayed at Powerscourt Hotel over Valentines weekend, it was our second visit, our previous time was when it was under Ritz Carlton management. Very little has changed under new owership and Everything was perfect,  there is definitely the feeling of staying in a 5 star luxury hotel.  Nothing is a problem for staff, from meet and greet at reception to breakfast room, the staff are well trained and eager to please.

It is a destination location and from my observations nearly everyone in the hotel is a guest,  there are lovely walks closeby, including Powerscourt gardens and  the lovely Avoca shop,
both worth a visit it you can pull yourself away from the hotel.

The spa area is very relaxing, with a fabulous steam room and hot tub.  

Food in all areas is fantastic and worth the money, we had drinks in the busy bar downstairs and the only disappointment was the music on the night, a sole singer who played only depressing songs... not uplifting for valentines night, but this is only a small gripe!

We will definitely stay again and recommend this hotel to anyone looking for a nice leisurely luxury break, definitely worth the price-tag for a special occasion and treat.",5,2014,03,23
217,Our escape to luxury,"After my boyfrend and I not getting to see each other much recently due to work commitments, we decided that we needed to treat ourselves and escape to luxury for a couple of days .We were delighted with our choice of hotel, warm, friendly, lots of charm and complete luxury.
Reception gave us such a warm welcome reassuring us that anything we needed to help make our stay more comfortable instantly put us at ease.
Our room was beautiful with the most comfortable bed imaginable, great closet area with huge mirror for dressing and the bathroom was immaculate with lovely fresh fluffy bathrobes.
We ate in Mcgills Bar, shepherds pie highly reccomended, and enjoyed the atmosphere, bar staff very attentive and efficient. We ordered breakfast to our room, usually I find breakfast delivered to your room is just not as good, however we ordered breakfast on both mornings as it was so good. The pool was outstanding, the beds to relax by the pool made us feel very rested.
On checking out we decided to visit the nearby Powerscourt waterfall recommended by a staff member, which rounded our 2 days off perfectly. Can't wait to plan our next stay.",5,2014,03,23
217,Cut backs obvious,"Stayed here recently with my hubby and baby son.
Top marks to staff for looking after us.
We got upgraded to a suite and our late check out was complimentary due to my frustration at trying to explain this to reservations staff on phone who clearly had very bad English and should not work in this type of job!
It's clear there are cut backs since its ritz Carlton days. 
Food in mc gills fab. 
Brekkie a lil disappointing. Buffet style dry over cooked items.
Had to ask for toast twice. 
Ikea style place mats and mat on floor!
For 5 star I'd expect more at brekkie. Monart have this one perfected.
Overall a nice stay but the biggest sting for me was the €4.50 price of a coke in the bar!
Not worth that anywhere!!",4,2014,03,21
217,Disgraceful customer treatment at a 5* hotel,"We were given a gift of a voucher to use in this hotel. From the moment of booking each time we called the staff had a different opinion whether the voucher would be honoured or not. This caused distress as to whether or not our trip would go ahead or not. We had to constantly try to follow up ourselves to resolve this ahead of arrival no one at the hotel seemed committed to resolve this for us. On arrival despite having finally resolved the voucher question with a duty manager the Saturday before we were again told that the voucher would not be honoured. 
In the room the duvet was lumpy, the balcony was too dirty to sit out on the chairs provided, the hairdryer was poor and the shower was weak. In the spa the ceiling was peeling and we were very unimpressed when we discovered that to access the heat suite (sauna, steam room, hot tub) you had to purchase a spa treatment, not just be a valued hotel guest who has paid €270 for the pleasure. At breakfast the tea was cold and we sent it back only to be replaced with more cold tea .
We had a spa package booked however were not advised to prebook our treatments. There was no availability in the spa for treatments on the day we arrived so we asked if the vouchers would be honoured at another date and were told no. We availed of 2 x 25 min treatments after check out and when settling our spa bill were then told that only treatments >50min would be covered by the vouchers. We were moved away from reception and offered a discount in lieu of honouring the vouchers and then quickly backtracked to honouring the vouchers. All the value of relaxing in a spa was completely gone. 
The concierge was called to 'deal with us' and felt we were 'making a scene' and would receive a call the next day - I was so glad to leave. We did not get a call the next day or day after. 
Disgraceful treatment of guests in a 5* hotel. Hold onto your money and enjoy a Blue Book stay with genuine luxury and treatment.",1,2014,03,21
217,Still a beautiful hotel but some issues,"This visit was the first for my wife and I since this beautifully constructed hotel changed hands from Ritz Carlton to Marriott. having read a number of reviews on this forum I was circumspect about returning and contacted the hotel directly about this and they were very helpful and friendly and allocated a suite (these seem quite freely allocated judging from other reviewers here but I suppose that makes sense as a kind of customer relations exercise if they are unoccupied). Anyway, the suite was beautiful and the staff and service all fine. The food quality had also been maintained in the restaurant both for evening meal and breakfast.

There is just one issue which will probably prevent me returning to the hotel in the future (or at least not as often as I might otherwise); the spa area is beautiful and, like all the hotel, executed with great taste. However, swimming  pools as such are not of great interest to me, but I love a sauna and whenever I stay in such a hotel this is the first place I make for in the spa area. However, in the beautiful ""Powerscourt Hotel"" it's not to be found. There is an excellent pool with whirlpool area and a steam room. The sauna is, inexplicably, located elsewhere in the hotel and subject to an additional charge (which is very, very cheeky). I do accept that this policy prevailed when it was Ritz Carlton so it's not a Marriot invention but obviously Marriot saw the situation provided additional funding and simply figured ""if it aint broke don't fix it"". However, it is a really bizarre set up and it was ""broke"" actually from the start. I cannot recall one other five star hotel anywhere in the world in which I've stayed where a) there was a spa area and pool etc. but no sauna and b) the sauna was located elsewhere and chargeable. I was talking to a fellow guest in the steam room (it was that or nothing) and he also preferred the sauna to a steam room and commented that he too found it very odd that there was no sauna in the pool area.

A sauna is actually quite cheap and easy to construct and there is a surfeit of changing areas both male and female in the spa area. These could be reduced without any diminution of facilities and a sauna could be constructed quickly and with little cost. Of course, the main problem being, the charge for the other one would be redundant!.  

Also, I do wonder have the ""Powerscourt Hotel"" never considered a dress code for their beautiful Sika restaurant? This would mean that the clintele match the special atmosphere/ambience of the place. Instead due to some people's cluelessness and lack of discretion this is diminished. On the night we ate in it some guests were very, very badly dressed. Now I'm not expecting black tie but jogging trousers and t shirts which show off tattoos. Not nice and certainly not classy to match the surroundings. For example, the famous Kellys Resort Hotel in Rosslare where I've stayed in the past and where I am returning with my family in April has a modest and reasonable stipulation of ""smart casual"" in their restaurant (and they're only 4*) as they obviously found out that common sense is not so common and some people and can't even stretch to a pair of jeans and a sweater when they present themselves for dinner nowadays!",4,2014,03,20
217,Second visit was a slight let down,"We visited this hotel in January 2014 and we loved it. We were booked into one of the cheaper rooms but we were so happy with the accommodation. The service was great, pool gorgeous and our children really enjoyed the experience. 

This time we booked into a suite (room 507) - we were slightly disappointed by this experience. There was no carpet on the floor from the front door of the room into the sitting area which looked very strange. The floor had many marks on it which made the place look scruffy and made it lack any type of luxurious feeling. There was dirt on the floor when we entered, no complimentary water like we had received the first time and the bedroom window was filthy (it was so bad my daughter noticed it not me!). The table in the bedroom was also covered in dust. The shower had very poor water pressure and had a very bad sewerage smell when we first used it. A complimentary fruit box arrived at our door which was appreciated.
We did have a wonderful lunch in McGills, followed by a gorgeous dinner in the restaurant. Breakfast was a treat, but we did have to request our children's pancakes 3 times. They arrived after about 35 minutes.
Generally we have a great overall impression of Powerscourt Hotel. However we did feel like it wasn't worth spending the extra money on the suite. But I have looked at other pictures on tripadvisor and seen suites which look better than what we were allocated. Maybe we were just unlucky in this instance, but it is frustrating as the rooms aren’t cheap!",4,2014,03,19
217,Gorgeous hotel !!!,"As Marriott Platinum members, I wanted to take advantage of our points and book a couple of hotels before we ventured out to B&B…
We stayed our first night in Dublin at the Shelbourne, and that was amazing as well, BUT this Powerscourt Hotel was was gorgeous and perfect for our two night stay.
We were upgraded to a suite, which was fabulous, the room was just impeccable and full of amenities, the beds were extremely comfortable and the bathroom was huge and just stunning.
The breakfast buffet was full of pastries, eggs, sausages, fruit, yogurt and just about anything that your heart desired.  We ended up eating at the Pub twice, it just had a fun, casual atmosphere perfect after a day of sightseeing and the food was great,  from the fish and chips, to the shepherds pie and the seafood chowder, to the great service by all behind the bar, we have not one thing to complain about.
Marriott, did not disappoint in quality and service !!!",5,2014,03,17
217,Stunning hotel and grounds with wonderful staff!!,"My boyfriend and I stay here for one night and I can't rate this hotel highly enough!! The entrance and grounds are just beautiful and the scenery is amazing! The hotel itself is one of the nicest I have stayed in, as soon as you enter the lobby you can see how grand it is and has a very relaxed and luxurious ambiance. On arrival we spoke to a lovely young man named Paul Hand at reception who was so friendly and welcoming. He then upgraded us to a nicer room as my boyfriend mention it was my birthday, and as our first point of contact he did a wonderful job as the face of the hotel! Our room was out of this world! I was surprised at how up to date the technology was and the bed and bathrooms were fab! We went down to the pool an relaxed there for a few hours and again such a great atmosphere to the place! We went out for the afternoon and came back to find a bottle of champagne chilling on ice with a lovely card congratulating my boyfriend on his new job from the Powerscourt team! Such a lovely touch and so thoughtful it really meant a lot! We had a great nights sleep and then had a lovely buffet breakfast the next morning, Tara from breakfast was a wonderful hostess! We were very sad to leave the hotel and will definitely be returning. Thank you to all the staff for an unforgettable stay!!",5,2014,03,14
217,amazing!,"just wonderful, nothing bad or disappointing about it. the hotel is mind blowing, the staff is great, breakfast was a real treat with fresh and high quality product.
what a unreal place to stay, can't wait to go back.",5,2014,03,12
217,Not a 5 star in sight! Don't book!,Staff complained about changing dirty wet towels from other guests at the pool. Spa pool full of young children under 5. Sauna payable at additional fee of 25 euro a head. Food average in restaurant and service very slow (1 and half hours to get a main course?) despite 60 eur a head for dinner. The parking had better be free for the disappointing service we got and the poor spa facilities!!! Don't waste your money.,1,2014,03,11
217,Beautiful but appalling service,"My husband and I had booked a local B&B for two nights but it was cold and depressing. We chose to treat ourselves to the hotel as we rarely get away on our own.
The Hotel is stunning - in a stunning location.
At first when the staff were selling us a room we encountered friendly and efficient service.
I was surprised in the bathroom that there were insufficient toiletries but I phoned reception to get more - which arrived 40mins later. 
That night we had hoped to have our dinner in the restaurant. We were told there was a function on and offered bar food upstairs. 
We discovered later that the function had not interfered with the restaurant - perhaps this was our misunderstanding - but we were disappointed.
The next morning I ordered pancakes for breakfast - as my husband ordered an omelette. 45mins later I still did not have my breakfast. My husband was finished his breakfast. No one came to check if everything was OK until we got up to leave - by which time I had had no breakfast and really was annoyed.
We discovered that my husband had left his jumper in the bar the previous night. My husband asked in reception about it. The reception staff informed him that they opened the bar and checked for his jumper but it was not there.
We left all of our details for them to contact us when they checked the cameras etc and sought further.
We went on a tour of the local area and decided to call by the hotel late evening before we headed home.
When we called by we were told by the same reception staff that they had checked everywhere. Checked cameras. Spoken to staff. The jumper was not to be found.
My husband walked out of the hotel disappointed and saw a stairway down to the bar from the outside. He walked into the bar which was packed. He went up to the barman and asked about his jumper. The barman turned around and picked up his jumper from beside the till - and said they had found it the night before and kept it.
Quite clearly no one in reception had turned their hand for one moment in pursuit of the jumper  and told lies about it.
My husband spoke to the manager and told him what had happened and how disappointed he was. Despite the manager's assurance that we would be hearing from him two weeks later we have heard nothing.
It was a one night stay. It should have been very special - instead it was very disappointing.",1,2014,03,10
217,Pure unadulterated quality,"I was lucky enough to be given a gift of an overnight stay at the Powerscourt hotel. 

Although the normal check-in time is 3.00pm, there was no problem getting in a bit earlier. In fact, not only was there no issue - they even upgraded us to a suite!  The Quality of the hotel is top class - from the décor & cleanliness, to the staff's helpfulness - really couldn't fault it. Our room was huge (though it was upgraded), & the all of the mod-cons were available (including THREE TVs, free WiFi & pretty much remote-controlled everything!

My wife had a treatment at the 'Espa', & she raved about it - once again, top quality service. I used the pool & Steam room, & again it was faultless.
We ate in the Sika restaurant - as expected it was delicious & the staff were excellent.

The Powerscourt is certainly not cheap, but you get what you pay for.
The setting is second-to-none, surrounded by the Wicklow mountains but less than an hour from Dublin City.  If you are looking for a weekend retreat with easy access to the city then look no further. Highly recommended  .",5,2014,03,10
217,The New Number One,"Afraid that the Chateau Frontenac in Quebec and the Jefferson in Richmond have to move down the chart a tad.  The Powerscourt in the Wicklow Hills of Ireland has taken over first place in my book. The setting is magnificent, the views breathtaking, the service close to perfect.  I cannot praise this venue enough.  Of course I was spoiled by a room with floor-to-ceiling windows.  The Powerscourt is a bit hard to find but well worth the search.  Again, it is somewhat expensive but  the cost is comparable to many less impressive hotels in Ireland and the United States.",5,2014,03,07
217,Amazing!!!!,My first time in the hotel! Wow! It was just incredible I would love to go back again one day I hope! Everything was so so special. The door porters to the bar staff all made you feel so comfortable and welcome. I cant say enough about this amazing place. ,5,2014,03,06
217,Relaxing,"Myself and my Mum stayed for the Winters Savers night at Powerscourt and it was a truly relaxing experience. We live quite locally so we would not normally stay so close to home but we had always been curious about the hotel and took advantage of the special offer. 

The room was very spacious, with a walk in closet, a double doored bathroom and two generous sized beds, which were very comfortable with super soft linens. 

We treated ourselves to a massage in the Spa, which had a fabulous Serenity area for relaxing in post-treatment. The pool is also surprisingly big for a hotel pool. 

Dinner was very tasty, and it is good to see that there are still some five star touches (post Ritz Carlton) with a amuse bouche, and petit fours been provided. The wines were also very tasty. Our waitress was Italian and overhead myself and my Mum planning a trip to Italy so she shared with us some tips for places/cities to go too. She was very nice and chatty and its also great to get some advice from a local! 

We did not go into Gills bar so we cant comment on this. 

Breakfast was a treat. It was Shrove Tuesday so the kitchen put on pancakes as an option - a lovely touch! The buffet was also well stocked with lots of tasty options. 

I would definitely recommend this hotel. I intend on coming back with my husband and enjoying another night away.",5,2014,03,05
217,Gorgeous Hotel,This is a beautiful hotel in a gorgeous setting. It is located next to the Powerscourt gardens. The gardens are amazing even in September in the rain. It is a nice walk into the village from the hotel. The Sugarloaf Lounge has a view of the mountain as well as really good fish and chips. We stayed in a suite with a garden view. It was very large and tastefully decorated. The bathroom had a separate shower and bathtub. It even had a TV in the mirror. There was a huge walk in closet with a bench. My only complaint was a rather aggressive bellhop that was determined to help us with our bags even though we said we didn't need help.,5,2014,03,03
217,had to think on this review,"A last minute getaway for five nights.  We got a good deal (was not the primary reason) , 5 nights incl breakfast two dinners and 4 x €30 vouchers in a junior suite so our toddler and ourselves stay sane.

As everyone will have read, this was the ritz carlton up until 6 months ago, now marriott premium brand.  I would summarise:

Pros:
- lovely room, loads of space, luxurious fittings
- top views and peaceful location
- staff are well managed, efficient and friendly
- breakfast buffet is fab, we spotted lots of organic products such as the eggs
- lovely touch.... the complimentary car service down to the village

Cons (please take a perspective on this, apart from one comment they are minor and fixable):
- The wine list in the restaurant is wide ranging alright, but way too expensive.  We travel widely and are lucky enough to be able to stay in nice places from time to time.  So we know when there is a balanced wine list..... and when there isn't.  I would say less than 2% of the wine list is less than €40, maybe a handful of wines.  I would say the markups are 200% - 300% which is unacceptable.  We ate out twice because of it...end of rant
- lacking staff in a couple of areas - the dedicated concierge desk does not seem to be manned, and also the spa top desk
- please FLUFFY bathrobes, not over washed

Summary:

A great experience and we will return, but please fix the wine list prices so we can spend more money in your restaurant ;-)",4,2014,03,02
217,Spa and food service very poor for a 5 star,"I stayed here with my wife and when she went to use the Spa a male employee walked into the womens changing room whilst she was changing (to refill water glasses), the next day another male employee was cleaning the womens thermal spa during opening hours. This is not really acceptable in an 5*, especially with the prices they charge.
We also ate in the ""fine dining"" restaurant, not only was it was cold and the service was slow but the food was only o.k.  
Other than that the room was perfection, we were welcomed at the door and at the bar, pity about the spa and restaurant.",2,2014,03,01
217,Lovely Hotel -but the victim on cutbacks,"Great setting ,scenery and surroundings a little out of the town of Enniskerry. Lovely food ,very friendly staff, rooms extremly comfortable but showing one or 2 signs of cutbacks in maintenance. evening meal was excellent, as was the breakfast.Swimming pool lovely but found pool staff indifferent. On asking if the sauna,steam room etc was in the pool area, I was informed that it was. Unable to find the steam room I enquired once again and was told it was on a different floor upstairs, inconvenient for a 5 star hotel. Do not sit on the relaxers near the pool sliding door, people rambling in and out tend to leave the door open and let the cold air blow in-this includes some of the pool staff. Overall a very nice one night stay but not 5 star in my opinion.",5,2014,02,28
217,Disappointing break away.,"This hotel did not live up to my expectations unfortunately. The  village, grounds and hotel building are all 5 star quality,once we entered the hotel, we were disappointed on many levels. Perhaps when you seek out a 5 star break your expectations might be set too high and can only lead to disappointment but we have stayed in one or two other 5 star hotels that would have left us feeling very enthusiastic about a return visit. Unfortunately we would not return here- which is a pity considering all of the natural advantages this hotel boasts.",3,2014,02,28
217,No broomstick required - A Magic Hideaway only 30 mins from Dublin!,"We were part of a large extended family group, staying at The Powerscourt Hotel to celebrate a significant birthday.  Although I had been to the hotel and its spa on previous occasions, I had forgotten how beautiful the long tree-lined avenue to the hotel appears and as you descend down the last curved section of the avenue to where the sunken Palladian style entrance awaits your arrival, you can feel your cares slip away, like a jacket falling from your shoulders.  In the front portico, we surrendered our car complete with luggage and checked in with a minimum of fuss.  It was at that point I realised that I had forgotten to book any spa treatments in advance and as it was Valentines weekend, I assumed (correctly) that I would not have the opportunity to be pummelled or ""facial-ed"" back to wellbeing.  Oh well, note to self and other guests ... best to book these things well in advance!  The reception, and Sugar Loaf lounge (with stunning views of the Sugar Loaf - surprise surprise!) are located on the fourth level (front entrance) with bedrooms descending down on lower levels, as well as the Silk restaurant and McGills pub (see separate review).  Our room, which was palatial, featured a large bedroom, a sitting room, very large walk-in closet and equally impressive bathroom with separate bath and walk-in shower cabinet with waterfall shower.  Our view to the rear garden from the windows was very zen like and we immediately relaxed.  Perhaps due to the AC system in the hotel, or perhaps due to the large size of our room, we struggled a bit to find a comfortable room temperature but overall it was fine.  A TV embedded into the wall in the bathroom made a Saturday afternoon soak feel very luxurious, after a number of hours enjoyably spent at the nearby Powerscourt House & Gardens.  We enjoyed a window-side table in the Sugar Loaf lounge on our first morning for breakfast - the buffet selection was excellent and the menu offered some additional dishes ""cooked to order"".  I hummed and haw-ed about whether to have the porridge in the buffet but opted to have it, with a little maple syrup and cream poured over - it was one of the best hotel porridges I have ever had (on Saturday but not quite as good on Sunday!).  Another winner on the breakfast menu is the patisserie selection, all made in the hotel ... miniature scones, pains au chocolat, Danish pastries, to name a few!  A small disappointment on Sunday morning for breakfast when Eggs Benedict arrived without any hollandaise sauce - for me, this dish is a treat that I have when on a special weekend away so while the eggs were perfectly poached, it was just eggs on bacon and a bun.  A blip in an otherwise excellent morning offering.  We dined on Saturday evening in Silk restaurant at the hotel and it delivered on food and service to the standard you would expect at this hotel (separate review).  All in all, despite the fact that the hotel was operating to full tilt, as it was a busy Valentine's weekend, the staff were consistently professional and welcoming.  Standards are very high and while a little upholstery wear is becoming evident in places around the hotel, I would happily spend many more nights in this magical place.",5,2014,02,22
217,What a beautiful Hotel,"We needed a little lift, something to get us away for a bit ( just from Dublin )...... What a beautiful place !..... Our two children had such a good time. I can't compliment the staff enough, so helpful, so friendly. I have stayed at the best hotels through work over the years, this is the best I have ever stayed in, & in my own back yard. Everything from the rooms, to the meals to the pool, to the general ambience is top class.The scenery is stunning, not to mention all the nearby attractions, Enniskerry  Village (incl Mac's Pub, great grub), the Sally Gap, and the general Powerscourt Estate, Golf, Gardens & Waterfall. What an experience, I'll Be Back ! Blown away !!! MickC, Drumcondra, Dublin City.",5,2014,02,21
217,Fabulous Hotel,"Stayed here for my Big Birthday celebrations with 5 friends 2 weeks ago & just returned from a family break yesterday so cant get enough of the place!
Gorgeous hotel very luxurious & relaxing, the bedrooms have the wow factor they even have in-built tv screen in the bathroom mirror so you can watch your fave programme from the comfort of your bath!
The pool is dark & very relaxing (go outside of childrens hours for optium relaxation!!) large jacuzzi & relaxing background music & flickers of candles everywhere is what I love so really relaxing & so warm also a nice hammam area with large steam room, showers & icecold bucket plunge or whatever its called! The laconium was too cold though think it should be turned up a bit as it feels like its off!
Breakfast was great service was brilliant didnt have to wait for anything very nice selection & hot food like eggs benedict, omelettes, pancakes, waffles etc etc available on request loved the little glasses of granola!
We didnt eat in the hotel but got a complimentary bus down the road to enniskerry village where we had booked Emilias Italian restaurant but unfortunately the service & food werent great there so 2nd time around we went to the enniskerry hotel & the food was gorgeous!
Johnnie Fox's pub not far from here & well worth a visit for the atmosphere alone & all the memorbilia a real old Irish pub you will love it.
Bray is only down the road & Greystones was lovely to go to walk on the beach & have a coffee in one of many coffee shops, Dun Laoghaire only 20 mins away with many nice eateries.
Powerscourt & gardens with Avoca is only next door hire bikes from the hotel & cycle or a quck stroll will have you there in minutes!
This hotel is amazing with staff that go above & beyond to make it special for you.
I'm sure with the change over it hasnt been easy for them but believe me this hotel is still top class Ritz Carlton in my eyes & prices have been reduced to reflect the name change even though it hasnt changed at all! 
A big thank you to Veronica in Reservations who was very helpful & professional & to the cheery friendly foreign guy who came to collect us in the jeep from Enniskerry cant think of your name but all the girls loved you! All the staff we encountered were fabulous thanks sooo much & see you again soon!",5,2014,02,19
217,"""Amazing place""","I was first time in this hotel and my opinion is the best place on the spent lovely weekend there, Staff is verry helpful, i must say big thank you, rooms fantastic keep high standard ,hope so come back soon again",5,2014,02,17
217,Noticable Changes,"I know this hotel very very well as we have been a regulars here for hotel stays and dining on many occasions over the years. Hence I would say I am a pretty good judge of this place.

Recently I booked a table to mark the birthday of a parent. Unfortunately the experience was not good. I found the sugar loaf lounge was cramped, extra tables added meaning little space, chairs/tables not comfortable and of poor quality. Presentation of food and quality poor, crockery etc very basic... just very disappointing all round. They also have a water dispenser on the floor which makes the dining experience feel like you are having breakfast in a motel in Times Square! Obviously they are adding tables to get people in which is not working in my opinion. All our party left disappointed.

I have always seen the Ritz(formally) as a ""go to"" hotel for some classic and upscale dining and getaways, not anymore. The day we were there we noticed many guests in tracksuits, runners etc, not what it used to be. I have no issue with this attire but the Ritz previously offered something a bit more upscale for a Sunday lunch/special occasion. Sadly the ritz brands exit is very evident for those who know the hotel so well.

Time to move on as this is not good enough anymore.

Paddy.",3,2014,02,14
217,Amazing experience,"We stayed herre on Feb 8th/9th 2014. We went for our friends birthday and got upgraded to fab suites. The staff are exceptional and couldnt have done enough for us. The food was delicous and the spa was out of this world. The girls in the spa were brilliant and gave fantastic treatments.
I would recommend it to anyone.",5,2014,02,11
217,Heaven on earth...!,"I worked here when the Hotel first opened and thought what better way to spend my Birthday celebrations than in a bit of luxury. To summarise - I wasn't disappointed! 

Myself and 4 friends booked a weekend here - our reservation was seamless. 

From the moment we walked in to the Hotel, we felt like Royalty - a bellboy intercepted to take our bags - check in was friendly and efficient - we were both upgraded to fabulous Garden View Suites (definitely work the extra few pennies) - the rooms facilities explained in great detail etc...

The Hotel is still as opulent as I remember even since the new takeover. 

The Breakfast Buffet in The SugarLoaf Lounge was delicious but the highlight of our trip had to be the Spa...we had booked a Spa Day Package including treatments, use of the Thermal Suites and lunch - an absolute bargain! 

Katie at the Spa Reception couldn't have been more welcoming with Dan (my therapist) giving me one of the best Massage & Facial Combo's I've ever had. 

Big shout out to Stephen (Front Desk Team) for our tour of the Presidential Suite  and Robert (Chief Concierge) / Kellie Ann (Spa Manager) for making our stay so memorable - we'll definitely be back!",5,2014,02,11
217,Beautiful location--- delightful hotel,"A luxurious and charming hotel with a welcoming and elegant spa. Our room had a mountain view and. was  spacious with a well appointed bathroom. The bed was comfortable and housekeeping impeccable. Dinner in the restaurant was delicious and the service was charming. Breakfast offered a wide range of buffet choices and freshly cooked hot options. 
The gardens and setting make the powerscourt hotel a relaxing and tranquil location and the spa and pool are just right to recharge the batteries !!
We look forward to a return visit",5,2014,02,10
217,Fantastic Hotel,"I stayed at this hotel for two nights with my wife and two children for a weekend break at the start of February 2014.
The hotel and the surroundings are magnificent. The staff were extremely helpful and the room was spotless. The price for food and drink in the hotel is naturally high (approx €25 per person for breakfast and €50-€60 per person for an evening meal), but the hotel offers complimentry transport into the small nearby village of Enniskerry where there are a few good reasonably priced restaurants. On our way to the hotel on the Friday evening we stopped at the Powerscourt Arms Hotel for something to eat and we all liked it so much we ate there four times and at Emilias Italian Restaurtant once. 
The Sugar Loaf Lounge in the hotel is very relaxing and you could quite easily spend a few hours in the Espa pool and spa area. The pool only allows children in between 9 - 12 and 3 - 6pm, but if you time this right it works very well. 
The Powerscourt gardens are beautiful and the Waterfall is something to see, although you'll have to drive to see it. It cost us €16 for a family pass.
Overall we thoroughly enjoyed the weekend break and we would go definately go back to the hotel to celebrate a special occasion. It made for a terriffic base to explore the Wicklow area.",5,2014,02,10
217,Excellent hotel,"Very reasonable prices, rooms done to an extremely high standard, staff were very polite and welcoming. Our stay was memorable and the spa was the best I have ever been to with the pool, sauna, hot tub and a nice shower afterwards. I recommend this hotel if staying in Ireland.",5,2014,02,08
217,"From check-in to check-out, the entire experience was amazing!","I don't even know how to sum up my seven day stay at Powerscourt, just thinking about it takes me back to such a relaxing, beautiful, and pleasant first visit to Ireland. From the moment we checked in we were greeted by the most pleasant staff I've ever encountered at any hotel. They really go out of their way to make you feel at home, and ensure you have everything you need.

We stayed in a suite which I found to be spacious and inviting. I loved the heated marble floor in the bathroom! The pub and restaurants served such good food, and again, every one of the staff we encountered were wonderful. They even drive you to the nearby village if you're looking for something other than what's on-site. 

The setting for this hotel was perfect for me. I was drawn to Ireland because of its landscape and I my expectations were exceeded. This hotel is set on beautiful well maintained grounds that invite you to walk and take in the scenery. Only a short distance from the sea-side town of Bray, and 20 minutes outside of Dublin, you still feel like you are in the heart of the country while staying accessible to city conveniences. I highly recommend that if you find yourself at this hotel that you go to Bray and do the Cliff Walk. It was breathtaking! 

Maybe it's an Ireland thing, but I really liked how the hotel does not nickel and dime you for important conveniences like WiFi. We'd much rather spend the money on a few extra pints at the pub downstairs. ;) 

And the thing we loved the most was the spa. The gym is spacious and well equipped, with a nice view for your workout. The pool looks exactly as it's depicted on their website. It's so serene, and peaceful down there with the music and the crystal lit pool. The absolute best thing was the Hannam Suite; a hot steam room. We tried to get as much time in at the spa as possible, going at least twice daily. The staff in the Spa were so nice. 

As wonderful as everyone was at the hotel, I have to give a special word for Pip who works in the spa. When we told her about our interest in walking around the countryside, she not only told us of great places to go, she looked up all the information about the locations online, and sent it all to our room with a lovely note. Her recommendations were perfect, and it really added a great touch to our trip. 

I would highly recommend this hotel to anyone visiting Dublin. Worth every penny, and more.

If I can make two suggestions to the hotel that we thought would add to the experience:
1. Add lit signs for the hotel from Enniskery Road. Until we got the hang of it, we passed it quite a few times since it's on that sharp corner. We noticed many others turning around at the same gate just past the hotel because they too had missed it. 
2. Please, please, keep the pool and Hannam Suite open later. Often times coming back from our excursions, we would have loved to relax at the spa before bed.",5,2014,02,06
217,Family vacay,"We planned a family vacation through a groupon and didn't know what to expect. We were jetlagged and stressed after experiencing the european driving for the first time when we got to the hotel. It was such a wonderful greeting! The staff was delightful, very helpful, and accommodating. We went to our suites which were amazing! SO much room, very luxurious, and perfect for us! I used the concierge every morning to plan our day and they were most helpful and even printed our driving directions and restaurants to eat at. The breakfast at the hotel was top-notch and we enjoyed it all 6 days of our stay. The staff was helpful and always accommodated us with such professionalism. From check-in to check-out it was a joy to stay here. Thank you!",5,2014,02,06
217,Powerscourt Hotel made our 1st Ireland trip very special!,"I stumbled upon an air/hotel/car package on the Internet and thought this luxury hotel could not live up to its former Ritz-Carlton reputation. I've never been so glad to be wrong! I decided to make a lifelong dream come true for my daughter who graduated college in December, so we scheduled the trip in late January. Flying from New York (JFK) into Dublin at 5 AM and then having our first European driving experience in the early darkness was stressful, but our first view of the majestic Powerscourt Estate was an eye-opener! Valets Peter and Stephen were especially kind during our 6 days, as were front-desk clerks Ruth and Monica. We expected their professionalism; we never expected the extreme graciousness and kindness we were shown! It was a pleasure every day to interact with them and with Ross Keating from McGill's, who was a breath of fresh air as well. Our suite was more spacious and comfortable than we had hoped, and the bathroom was AMAZING! We had impressive meals from McGill's and the Sugar Loaf Lounge and were blessed to also enjoy meals in the nearby village of Enniskerry (Poppie's, Emilia's, Kingfisher's and Mac's Bar were all wonderful). From our base at the hotel, we drove an easy 2 hours to the west coast, 2 hours to Northern Ireland, less distance south to Glendalough/Wicklow National Park and just 10-15 minutes east to the Bray/Greystones area on the Irish sea, where we were able to catch the DART train into the Dublin City Centre for a day of stress-free sightseeing. We will never forget this beautiful country and scenery, but mostly we will never forget some of the most genuinely friendly people on the planet! I can only hope that we can afford to return one day with the rest of my family! What a terrific experience!",5,2014,02,05

I have attended the spa twice in the last month and haven't had one negative thought throughout both trips or since. on the second occassion there was a mix up with bookings but Kerry Anne couldn't have been more accomodating. On the day we saw some really nice touches from birthday gifts to patrons to complimentary prosecco through lunch. 

it will be a monthly visit for us for sure.",5,2014,02,05

The only shame was we had only 1 night.
If you are looking for a plush, relaxing and exquisite hotel break..look no further than here . You wont be disappointed...",5,2014,02,03
217,Great hotel in a splendid location,"Clearly built during the height of the Celtic Tiger boom years this hotel must rank as one of the best in Ireland. Clasic design coupled with breath-taking views it really is worth a visit. The Spa/pool is very relaxing and has a steamy east Asian vibe. Rooms are very clean, quiet and well appointed, with (typical Ritz Carlton) high end finish. The service matched the hotel with the staff striking a fine balance between being attentive and unobtrusive. On top of all this the hotel is located on the historic Powerscourt estate which boasts world class gardens and a wonderful grand manor house. the local village is full of small (but authentic) pubs and eateries, and all this within 20 minutes of Dublin... Highly recommended.",5,2014,01,31
217,Beautiful hotel!,"We were delighted to stay at the Powerscourt Hotel!  It was a part of our Ireland tour package, and  we had the honor to stay here on our last night of our journey.  Of course we were disappointed to not get to stay more the one night, but what a way to end our trip!  
The room was amazing--separate dressing area, the bedroom itself was larger than any other hotel room than we had ever stayed in, and the bathroom was nearly as big as the bedroom!  I am quite tall, and the large jacuzzi tub had plenty of room for me.  The amenities were beyond what we expected--turn down service, touch screen to control all functions in the room, complimentary robes, water, and all around nice service.  We had a room that faced the gardens, which was just fine.  We ordered the tiramisu for dessert one evening (my mom's favorite) based on a picture on this website--it's deceivingly large in the photo, and is really quite small, but was still tasty. I also took a photo of the tiramisu-and made it look just as large and amazing as I thought it was going to be!  :)
The staff were nice, and were able to help us with figuring out how much time it would take us to get to the airport.  We didn't have a lot of time to wander around Enniskerry, but we went to the Powerscourt the morning before we left and had breakfast on their patio.  It was a lovely experience, and I wish we would've had time and the money to explore their gardens.  The little town of Enniskerry was quaint and fun to walk around.  We ate dinner at a pub and visited the shops the next morning.  
Thanks for a lovely stay!",5,2014,01,30
217,In my top 5 Hotels,"Stayed here for 1 night for my girlfriends birthday last week. On arrival our bags were taken from us and we checked in. This was efficient and very personable with the receptionist taking an interest our drive to hotel etc. We were then escorted to our room and shown around by the porter. This is one of the nicest rooms i have stayed in so far. Quite a big sized room and the hotels standard size. After2/3 minutes of settling into our room, a card and chocolates arrived for my girlfriend. Its the personal small touches that make a hotel stay stand out from the rest. The room had an extremely comfortable bed, walk in wardrobe, separate shower and bath - bathroom has tv in the main mirror and surround sound. Over all an excellent room.

The spa gives all quests access to the pool and steam room and also vitality pool. The pool has loungers around the side which are very comfortable. There is a thermal suite for both men and woman which are separate. This is upstairs in the spa and is available to use with spa treatments or at a separate cost of €25pp for thermal suite only. Within the thermal suite is sauna, steam and vitality pool which looks out over the grounds. The relaxation area overlooks the grounds and has electric beds. 

Had dinner in the restaurant downstairs and was excellent although they couldn't really accommodate any changes to the main courses. In fact I was surprised a head chef would allow a main course to leave the kitchen so bare. The waiter himself seemed embarrassed and offered us a drink to make up for this. However food was very tasty. Breakfast was excellent with a great selection. There seemed to be a shortage of space at peak time though with not enough seating. We ate also in the Lobby next day and food was also nice. 

This hotel was built at the height of the Celtic tiger with no expense spared. It still maintains the high standard although I would say the hotel is a little wilted around the edges from when I visited at the peak of the Celtic tiger. It still maintains its elegance. I did find however since it changed for the Ritz-Carlton to Marriott the service has slightly slipped. The hotel is at the upper end price wise, but worth the treat. We paid €270 for 1 night B&B with dinner. I would return again but only for a special treat as there is an abundance of other excellent hotels running great special offers at a fraction of the price.",5,2014,01,29
217,not as good as the ritz carlton,"My wife and I have been regular guests at this property when it was a Ritz Carlton 5 star hotel.the rooms,amenities and surroundings are still fabulous,but I think where this hotel falls short is with service.At evening dinner and breakfast next morning service was slow and lacking in some areas.Not what I expect from a 5 star hotel.If this hotel claims 5 star status and charges 5 star prices,then it should deliver 5 star services.",3,2014,01,29
217,A Must Stay!,"My wife and I stayed at the absolutely wonderful Powerscourt Hotel in early January and what a great stay we had.  We were there for 6 nights in a junior suite and it was fantastic.  The staff was awesome and extremely helpful. The breakfast was fantastic. The room was perfect and extremely comfortable. I don't want to sound like we don't get out much because we do, it is just that this Hotel was so good.  The concierge we dealt with was the best.  She mapped out a couple of day trips for us and it was perfect.  The conversation with her was most interesting and downright delightful.  She made us feel so welcome and at home in Ireland.  You won't be disappointed with the Powerscourt Hotel.  Can't wait to go back…...",5,2014,01,28
217,Wonderful,"Had a fab stay with my wife at the powerscourt, the hotel was quite at the time and we were given a huge room, service was super and dinner in the restaurant was very good, look forward to returning. My only complaint was the lack of atmosphere in the restaurant, but again the hotel was quite.",5,2014,01,27
217,Customer service as it should be,"I was on a break in Ireland and had heard about the Spa at Powerscourt Hotel from a friend who had spent time there. I rang to check out times etc and spoke to Kata. When I arrived I was shown around by Pip. Can I say that both these ladies should start their own training courses in 'how to do it'....they were both so professional, friendly, knowledgeable and made a slightly older lady like myself, on my own, feel special, safe and cared for. 10 out of 10! Will be seeing Pip and Kata again definitely! Thank you.",5,2014,01,26
217,Fabulous Hotel,"We spent a night in this hotel with friends to celebrate an occasion. On arrival we were upgraded to suites. The rooms were well equipped. The touch pad controls were easy to use. 
Excellent walking by the river and in the gardens. The hotel was not crowded when we were there and we were able to enjoy tea in front of a fire after walking.
We ate in the hotel restaurant. We had feared that the loss of the Gordon Ramsay 'mark' might have resulted in a loss of quality. One member of our group who had been there in the days when it was a Gordon Ramsay restaurant assured us that the standard was, if anything, better than before. Restaurant staff were good, particularly Josef who struck the perfect balance between attentive and intrusive.
Breakfast was also excellent with a wide choice of well presented items.
The friendliness and helpfulness of all the staff we met was noteworthy.
The only downer was the rain - but it is Ireland.
We will definitely be back.",5,2014,01,22
217,Excellent mini break!,"Just returned from a one night spa break at the Powerscourt Hotel, a birthday treat for my Daughter.  There were three of us so we asked for a triple room, on arrival we were given a very warm welcome and informed we had been upgraded.  Our room was a suite with two double beds, sitting room, dressing room and a huge bathroom (amazing).  A lovely touch was a card and macaroons delivered to our room for the birthday girl.  Part of our package was a voucher for the spa for 30 euro but you could only use it for a facial or massage and as none of us wanted either of these they went un-used, which was a pity.  We all really enjoyed our stay and left feeling very relaxed and pampered and feeling that we got brilliant value for our money, we will be back!!",5,2014,01,20
217,Amazing Hotel!,"We absolutely loved staying here! The service was phenomenal, all the staff were wonderful, VERY friendly and quick to help with any need or question we had, including printing out maps, recommending places to eat in the village, everything!!

The entire hotel and grounds are beautiful, and the rooms are amazing….. incredibly comfortable and spacious.

The food at both the Sugar Loaf and McGills were very good, as was the service.

The location was perfect, we had the village right there (and having the shuttle from the hotel to the village was AWESOME), and Dublin was only a DART ride away (there's a DART station in the neighboring village of Bray, we just took our rental car there, parked it for the day, and rode DART to Dublin) so we didn't have to try to drive and park in the city while exploring, which worked out very well for us. I would definitely stay here again and recommend it to anyone looking for a place to stay!",5,2014,01,20
217,Disappointing,"Another architectural hotel that really doesn't work. The design of this hotel should be interesting, its a stunning location with plenty to do around it but now that Gordon Ramsey has gone theres very little to make this special. Theres not enough public space for the large amount of rooms with plenty of visitors to the gardens coming in for afternoon tea depriving residents of the ability to sit in the lounge. 

Breakfast is a shambles more like a club lounge in a Marriott than a proper breakfast, yes you can order a la carte if you can find a perspex menu but the service took forever and the food was hard, dry and cold when it arrived. 

The Irish Pub bar in the dark may be alright for a team building event but its not where you want to sit when the sun is shining and you're meeting up with friends and can't sit upstairs in the daylight because of the tourists having afternoon tea.  

Bedrooms/Suites(?) are badly arranged with the bathroom and wardrobe not begin directly connected to the bedroom so you have to walk through the lounge to get dressed. Weird ! Touchpad controls are not intuitive and feel very dated. Need to bring a torch if you wan tot read as the room lighting is totally inadequate, a few low powered table lamps in the main, supposed to provide mood lighting but you can't find your socks in the morning 

The lack of ownership by management is the biggest issue as no-one seems to be in charge of the bars and restaurants. Trish (?) on the front desk was the saving grace who went out of her way to help with everything and anything but everything else was a disappointment. Romm wash;t ready when we got there despite arriving late afternoon.

Better off staying in town and coming out here for the day and booking afternoon tea. I would not stay here again",2,2014,01,20
217,Excellent all 'round,"It's a bit pricy, but is a great experience.  The suites are fantastic and really live up to what a 5 star should be.  The staff were polite and helpful and their was a nice atmosphere throughout the hotel.  
The restaurant offers a great dinning experience.  Having eaten there for dinner and lunch several times I can safely say it is among my favourite restaurants in Ireland.  The food is not overly expensive, but you really get what you pay for.  The dishes are packed full of flavour and you are keenly aware that they have been crafted to give extra enjoyment to the dinning experience.

Breakfast is superb, with a delicious selection to appease even the fussiest palette.  The staff were once again great here and couldn't do enough to help. 

The best thing about the hotel is its location.  The views are spectacular and it is nicely secluded, but easily accessible.",5,2014,01,20
217,Swimming Pool - Infant Price,"I bought my two sisters €100 vouchers for the spa as part of their Christmas present with a view to arranging a trip in mid-February to avail of the twilight package. 

One of my sisters had recently undergone knee surgery and that was why our trip was going to be in February. That same sister has a small baby (9 months old) and I made enquiries into taking him with us with one of us looking after him when two of us were having treatments and then the other having a treatment and the baby being supervised by the others. When I enquired as to whether the baby could accompany us, the hotel confirmed he  could and when I enquired as to whether there would be a fee, I was informed last Friday evening that they wouldn’t imagine so having regard to a fee usually only being charged to use the gym facilities. Having regard to the fact that the baby would not be using the gym facilities, the representative said she didn’t imagine a fee would be charged. Nonetheless I asked if should could telephone me back to confirm. 

I didn’t receive any call back so I telephone the hotel again last night again and I am just off the phone after receiving a call back today. When I explained the situation, the representative after checking with her manager Emma said there would be a €25 fee payable for the baby to use the “exclusive” facilities. When I noted my surprise to this inflated charge and my previous telephone conversation with the hotel, I was informed that this was the fee payable to use the “exclusive facilities” notwithstanding the fact the charge is for a 9 month old baby. 
I am really disappointed with this customer service and having regard to the fact that the hotel will be receiving €255 from the 3 of us attending on the day we go to the spa, I expected a lot more customer service. We had planned to have lunch in the hotel prior to attending the spa but I am seriously reconsidering giving the hotel any further money having regard to the over inflated charge. 

My experience of the hotel has been tainted already just with telephone conversations with them!",1,2014,01,17
217,Amazing Place to Stay!!!,"We loved this hotel.  It is about 30-45 mins outside of Dublin but worth the stay.  The customer service is unbelievable as well as the accommodations.  I  can honestly say I have never slept in a more comfortable bed in my life.  The pub in the basement was good, as well as Gordon Ramsey's.  We went to Enniskerry a couple of times, the hotel has a shuttle that will take you there however it is a nice walk.  We ate at a little pub there at it was the best!!  The people in the town were so nice and accommodating.   We stayed 6 nights and wished we had stayed more.  LOVED this place!!",5,2014,01,16
217,A bit disappointed for 5 star.,"I was travelling with my husband, my mother and our two children. I had requested a classic suite with two beds and a superior deluxe room. I had asked for them to be close to each other (eg same floor). I also requested early checkin if possible. Lucky enough due to a tip from a friend I booked both lunch and dinner or like other reviewers I would have been left waiting. In the end we didn't get either room I requested we had to be changed to different rooms and myself and my husband ended up in a dark hole of a room looking out at a wall separated from my mother and children by reception and the lounge. And still charged the same. By the time we settled for what we got it was 5 o clock. No apology nothing. The swimming pool was packed but this happens when there is children but was very clean. The food was delicious but pricey and the drinks were extremely dear. Nearly €20 for two drinks. On checkout I was told a manager would ring to apologise but I never heard a thing. All in all nice hotel but serious problems with reservations. ",4,2014,01,16
217,The Ritz at Powerscourt,"We were at the Powerscourt in late October 2013. It is without a doubt the nicest hotel we have ever stayed in anywhere. The staff just went overboard to be helpful and go over and above in every area of service. The place was immaculate and beautifully decorated. There was a free taxi to nearby Enniskerry. The desk staff always helped us with our daily travel interaries, printing maps and offering brochures and friendly advice, bottles of water - just anything to make us feel welcome and pampered.
This was part of a GROUPON deal so we aren't sure what the rooms normally go for, but for us the whole experience was a fantastic bargain. If we could afford it, we'd definitely go back!",5,2014,01,14
217,Amazing In All Facets,"This hotel was absolutely amazing from the gorgeous golden décor to the fantastic staff whom bend over backward for guests.  We stayed in a suite for the length of a week and we never felt claustrophobic in the slightest.  The room was very welcoming and the electronic control panels situated throughout the rooms were fantastic and very fun to play with.  Wonderful floor to ceiling windows that showcased the garden and it's sculptures.  Now for the best part...the bathroom!  The marble floors in the bathroom are HEATED, there is a television inlaid into the mirror with a surround sound wired throughout the bathroom, there is a massive soaking tub, and a rain shower head.  The guest service was everything the Ritz Carlton stands for, going above and beyond for it's guests.

Pro's: The pool is located in the spa, but it is free; the chance of early check-in increases if you check-in Monday thru Thursday; the village of Enniskerry is only about 5 minute drive from the hotel with cozy restaurants!; the hotel will drop you off into town if you wish; McGill's is fantastic and reasonably priced; bicycle rentals are complimentary and the enormous hotel property is a beautiful ride.

Con's:  The hotel is approximately 30 minutes outside the city of Dublin, the main highway to Dublin has tolls (it's toll system is a bit complicated, it's best to avoid if possible)

We had rented a car for our stay in Ireland, which is highly recommended as the transportation systems are not always reliable.  If you do rent a car a GPS rental is a must!

Despite popular belief Ireland has a zero tolerance for DUI's, any alcohol in your system is grounds for an arrest, and the staff informed us the garda (police) have DUI check points.

If you are a smoker it would behoove you to know that only certain stores cell cigarettes and they are not on display.  There is a heavy anti-smoking movement so do not be surprised if instead of a label on the pack it's a picture of a person with cancer.  You are also not allowed to smoke in public area's, ask a local to find out where it is ok to smoke.  If you are a non-smoker like we are you'll find it rather nice =)",5,2014,01,13
217,"Hotel with Awful service, rude staff and expensive, not 5 star. Nice view and great spa.","I would not call this 5 star nor would I recommend this hotel. Our first night away from our baby and we were really looking forward to some peace and quiet, rest and rehabilitation and spoiling ourselves, celebrating our wedding anniversary in style.  What we experienced was nothing short of noisy, poor service, rude staff and a massive bill. We were told we could not have afternoon tea in the bar as there were no tables and there was a waiting list. We were not asked if we would like to be added to the list and when we explained that we were hotel guests we were told that there was also another 299 hotel guests that wanted afternoon tea. Our room, whilst big and beautiful was situated above a kitchen or cutlery cleaning room of some sort as all we could hear was cutlery being cleaned, dropped and people talking. I called room service for some tea bags and fresh milk, 20 minutes later I called them again to find out where they were. We went for breakfast the next day to be told there were no tables and that 50 people were waiting, this is a meant to be a five star hotel surely they know how many guests to expect for breakfast and be able to cater for them. The spa managed to lose our booking although they were fabulous in how they handled the situation and I will happily recommend the spa and would not hesitate to visit again. In summary a wonderful spa definitely worth a visit but stay clear of the hotel at all costs.",1,2014,01,12
217,Fantastic Experience,"This place is great for golf, SPA, and a relaxing vacation. It is far 30-45 min from downtown, so if you are planning to explore the city daily it its not the best option. The staff was very accommodating and the food was very good.",4,2014,01,12
217,Another WOW review,"I have read all the WOW reviews about the Powerscourt Hotel and wonder is it worth writing another? Well the answer is yes!!
The Hotel is super, everything is great, if you want to impress a client or special person near Dublin this is the place to do it. Could it be Ireland's only 6* Hotel?",5,2014,01,12
217,Christmas Break,"This hotel is beautiful and the rooms are something else plus the bathroom is enormous and food was great. The staff are very helpful and friendly.

The grounds around the hotel are lovely and very nice to walk around in the morning

I would recommend anyone to stay here!",5,2014,01,09
217,Still has the wow factor,"We stayed in the Powerscourt Hotel ( formerly the Ritz Carlton) 3 nights over Christmas holiday. The hotel has still held on to its charm and wow factor since the change of onwership. From entering the hotel lobby/reception which is grand and lovely decked out for the festive season. Check in was smooth and professional, room was not ready so had a drink in the hotel lobby whilst waiting ( room was not ready for 2 hours, some other guest were waiting over 3 hours for rooms to be ready - due to late checkout of previous guests). 
Our mountain view suite was exceptional, spacious, clean and every extra you could require, housekeeping were on top of their job every day. Our room was well laid out and great view of the mountains.
We ate twice in the hotel, once in McGill’s ( Bar), and The Sugar Loaf on the other occasion food was top class in both. However the level of service has definitely dropped in The Sugar Loaf since our last visit and this was also evident when having our breakfast here each morning. The waiting staff were not attentive and tables were slow being cleaned after each guest, and you just got a general feeling of not interested in the guest. Service was slow and had to enquire 4 times for our breakfast order, this was the norm as other tables/guests were also left waiting on their orders.
The gym and Spa facilities are top class and worth a visit, the view from the gym of the mountains was spectacular.
A walk to the nearby village of Enniskerry is a must, or a stroll on the river walk.

Enjoyable stay, the only falling star was the waiting staff and level of service they offered.",4,2014,01,08
217,Weekend spa break in November,"We stayed as a couple back in November, and booked two spa treatments. The hotel setting is beautiful. When we arrived the staff at reception were very friendly. Our hotel room was spacious and had all mod cons. The spa experience was very relaxing despite being very busy, the only downfall was we could not get a seat in the relaxation room which I thought was disappointing so we went to the thermal suites instead. We did not dine in the hotel that night, we decided to go to a near by restaurant near stepaside. On the Sunday morning the breakfast was impressive and had plenty of choice. We went for a swim and the pool was impress  and was not too busy. Overall an enjoyable experience, despite the very busy spa. We will be back! If you get a chance visit powers court house and waterfall!",5,2014,01,06
217,Midweek Break,Stayed here for a Dinner B&B overnight break when visiting Dublin.  Staff very helpful & friendly.  Leisurre facilites really excellent. My wife had made the booking as a treat and we really enjoyed ourselves.  The hotel setting is excewllent and we enjoyed a waqlk in powerscourt the following morning before our departure.,4,2014,01,05
217,Oh it could be so much better 5 star prices 3 star food and service,Go into any decent pub in Ireland and the food would be 10 times better than here. I have been to much better run 4 star hotels. In this day and age there is no need for wilted soggy lettuce in your caesar salad and rare steak when you asked for medium. Especially not expected here! This was my first visit and I won't be back. Rooms very lovely. Agree with others about lighting and that there seems to be cost cutting measures in place. I enjoyed breakfast.,2,2014,01,05
217,"Beautiful, Spacious, Courteous, Delicious...","Stayed at the Powerscourt for 5 days, had an awesome experience. The Estate is gorgeous even in the dreariness of late December. The hotel itself it very nicely put together and tasteful while still giving a sense of being grand. The entire experience was still very Irish, lots of warm inviting spaces and smiles from all of the staff. We ate breakfast daily in the main restaurant and were not disappointed, Full Irish Breakfast was available even on the buffet. Spent a fair bit of time in the down stairs pub, McGill's. it was a very quaint space and dripped in traditional pub feeling, but was a bit pricey. There was also a ton to do very close to the Powerscourt, with only being a 15 min drive from Bray, a 45 min drive from Glendalough, and many more.",5,2014,01,05
217,Graciously accommodated food allergies; Beautiful Setting,"We spent Christmas Eve and Christmas Day here with our 3 teenagers. The property and setting are just beautiful. We splurged on a mountain-view suite with a connecting room and the view was well worth it. The rooms were decent-sized, and an unusual feature was that the rooms adjoined via room-sized walk-in closets. My only complaint about the rooms is the poor lighting. Each room needed either some overhead lighting or a few more lamps. The bathrooms were well-lit, though.

Meals with pre-set menus were included with this package, which is a concern for one of our children with many food allergies. However, the staff and chef kindly arranged for a special, equally lovely, menu for my son, which was much appreciated. 

I would love to return to this property in the summer, when better weather might permit longer walks on the grounds.",4,2014,01,04
217,A little gem,"A great break for all ""fabulous food stunning surrounds complimentary bikes and great staff"" this all makes for a great relaxing break.
Entertainment in the bar was a bonus (2 men on guitars just great will play and sing all your favourites)

Looking forward to our return",5,2014,01,04
217,Nice location - poor service,"The hotel is set in a beautiful location.  Although it was purpose built it just hasn't  been thought through very well. There are no common areas with soft seating to relax in other than a couple of token settees by the entrance.  The purpose of our trip was to meet up with family.  On arrival at 14:00 we found we couldn't get any lunch in the restaurant (50% of the tables were empty and we were told they had been reserved,  this was for afternoon tea at 15:00 onwards)! We ended up sitting on uncomfortable benches in the dark no window basement pub with a TV blaring (football match) and music competing with it with an 85 year old aunt who we hadn't seen for ages.  We couldn't even go to our room as it wasn't ready! We got access to the room at 15:30. The suite rooms although a good size are not well planned, they are dark with inadequate bedroom lighting (2 wall lights on opposite wall to the bed and one dim table lamp between the two beds - no overhead lighting). Nowhere to plug in tongs with access to a mirror. Had to ask several times for the extra bed for our daughter. Breakfast was a fiasco, cold and un imaginative. They kept running out of different things and were very slow at replacing them (if they had them) and that was when you asked! Not sure why you would put potatoes in the same warming dish as black pudding (for the veggies)? Above all else service was terrible - to get drinks and the right ones was very difficult or impossible. It seemed like there were plenty of staff around but no one willing to serve! Such a shame this hotel really isn't a 5 star at best it's a 4 star with 3 star service!!!! ",2,2014,01,04
217,Over rated,"Oh dear frankly this was a disappointment.The suite was lovely,clean and quiet,however it really is a bit much to have to beg housekeeping three times for toiletries and wait over two hours.There is little or no communication with the front of house staff,we for example were told that our boarding cards would be delivered to our room,needless to say they did not arrive and no one knew anything about it at the desk despite three calls regarding this.The food in the restaurant was good,the  breakfast was cold and self service unappetising unimaginative and generally second rate.The lighting is ridiculous,although I get the desirability of atmospheric conditions the 40 watt bulbs are utterly useless.
It really has the feel of cost cutting about it which is a shame when one considers the prices paid.
The lady at receptor asked if we had enjoyed our stay and was keen to hear our comments,really though these are raised time and time again and seemingly nothing is done.
I know this review sounds picky but the fact is this is purportedly of a high standard the reality is that it has a penny pinching feel about it.
PLEASE check your room bill we were told it was 470 Euros when in fact it was nothing at all,it did take a bit of persuading that we were never in the spar much less having treatments.
I would recommend going into the village for a meal the Old Forge Inn is a lovely place inexpensive and welcoming with great home made fare.
If you want luxury near Dublin go to the Four Seasons they really are worlds apart.",3,2014,01,02
217,Expected more!,"We had an overnight stay in the Ritz Carlton. As it was our first night away following the birth of our baby we decided to go all out and book a suite. The hotel is lovely and the suite was fabulous for the most part, but where we found it lacking was in the service. Having stayed in a number of 5 star hotels over the years, both in Ireland and abroad we expected more. We also booked to eat in Gordon Ramsey restaurant, again we expected more; steak being overdone is not acceptable in such a restaurant. The following morning for breakfast the delay in getting some eggs poached was so long that we were finished eating by the time they arrived. One issue with the suite was the TV in the mirror would not turn off, granted we could have called someone about it but again for the price we paid, we expected to not have to deal with maintenance issues.",4,2014,01,01
217,Festive and fabulous.,"A very lovely treat from my in laws. 
We arrived and after a small wait check in was smooth. We had in advance asked to be next to our relatives room. Shown to a room at the other side of the hotel. We declined and were then given a room next door to our in laws.

Rooms were comfortable large and my 3 year old son loved the tv in the bathroom. 

Xmas lunch was scrumptious with something for everyone. A little disappointed no carrots or roast pots but you can't please everyone. 

Enjoyed a quiet night in our room watching Xmas tv. 

Breakfast was delicious and I absolutely over indulged. We had a lovely swim before check out. Wish we were there for longer.

My only gripe was we ordered a pint of milk and 2 pieces of wheatabix  from room service and it cost us €17 bit surprised.",5,2014,01,01
217,perfect get away,"My husband and I spent 2 nights at powersourt after Christmas. I had stayed there once before when it was a Ritz in March and I was nervous there would be many changes, especially with the food in the restaurant. This is truly a beautiful luxury hotel and is well worth its 5 stars. I travel a lot and this is one of the best hotels i have stayed at.

The only difference I noticed from when it was a Ritz is that when I went for my morning run I was not offered a towel and bottle of water as I was the last time but this did not bother me in the least. the staf were all very welcoming. room service was fast and when I asked for ice it was delivered very quickly (counter to another guest review). I had a facial and manicure and actually they were better than my last visit.  

The head chef is the same and the food was excellent in the main restaurant where we ate the second night. The service in the restaurant was also first class. The service and food in the bar area was less good.

The rooms are spacious and beautiful and we had a lovely view of the sugar loaf mountain. This is the first time i have written a review on trip advisor and am doing so to strongly recommend this hotel to anyone who would like a get away in a rural area but still very close to Dublin.",5,2013,12,31
217,Class with Dignity,"It's the little things that make the difference and on my last day of a three night stay I wondered if the Powerscourt Hotel had fallen at the final fence.  I wanted to swim before going home but didn't want to pack a wet costume.  They were ahead of me - there was a spin dryer in the changing room.  This attention to detail and guests' needs sets the hotel apart.  Nothing is too much trouble for the staff, who were busy as my husband and I stayed between Christmas and New Year. Nevertheless, when I wanted some photocopying it was done immediately and when I asked for a yellow highlighter one was produced straight away.  

Our suite was wonderfully comfortable.  A bed you looked forward to sleeping in, large bathroom, dressing area and comfortable lounge.  One tiny quibble - it would have been nice if there had been biscuits in the room and fresh milk, but I'm sure they'd have been brought if requested.  Also, the lights were quite complicated - but nothing that couldn't be solved, and the keypad was quite fun to figure out in fact..  

For me the swimming pool was the highlight of the trip.  It is enormous, heated to a perfect temperature, and adults can swim alone before 9 am, between 12 and 3 and after 6 pm.  The loungers beside the pool are ergonomic, which means sublimely comfortable.  The pool itself is black with Swarkowski crystals glinting from the bottom.  As you enter the pool area you feel this wonderful sense of deep, dark water, which is sheer joy to swim in.  When I arrived home my daughter told me I looked really well.  This wasn't thanks to lots of treatments (I didn't have any) but to lots of swimming in luxury.

The sugarloaf restaurant served delicious evening meals.  There was also a choice of a more expensive restaurant and a pub.  The breakfast buffet was wonderful - lots of different breads and pastries and fruit as well as full irish breakfasts, which seemed very popular.

I can't wait to return.",5,2013,12,31
217,"Beautiful Property, Busy Restaurants","This hotel is one of the most beautiful I have ever stayed in--with spacious, immaculate rooms, a gorgeous view of the Sugar Loaf mountain, and even a beautiful river walk nearby. My party stayed here by accident after a vacation rental booking went awry (the place we rented was very misrepresented) and we needed to make alternate arrangements. With nowhere in central Dublin to stay we started to look outside of the city and found The Ritz! Lucky us! We enjoyed the spa, the really nice crystal-lit pool, and the spa's quiet room that overlooked the mountains. The only drawback was that we arrived Saturday night and the restaurants were fully booked for days. I would advise anyone booking here to call ahead and reserve a table, just in case. That said, the village has a lovely Italian place that's totally worth the beautiful walk into town!",4,2013,12,30
217,LUXURY,"We stayed in the powerscourt for 2 nights. Everybody was very friendly, check in was fast. The room was fantastic and the bathroom was huge. Once you are in your room you cannot hear anything outside, it is so quiet. Cannot wait to return. Breakfast is lovely with a great selection. Pool and leisure area is great.",5,2013,12,29
217,Perfect,We stayed here for a recent wedding and it was just perfect. Our room was stunning and all staff were so helpful. The rooms are a little pricey but great value for what you get. Highly recommend a visit!,5,2013,12,29
217,US Ladies Stay,"We booked the hotel when it was a Ritz and arrived under the Marriott name.  Didn't appear to make a difference.  The hotel staff were overwhelming friendly and helpful.  They even lent us their golf cart the first day with blankets to take a tour around the grounds.  Be sure to stop at the Garden area and take the garden walk.    In addition, the shops and dining area at the gardens is wonderful. Food is delicious and shopping is unique and friendly.  If traveling from outside of Ireland, be sure to get your tax-free card.  This card can save you lots of $$ if you plan on purchasing many goods.  The hotel rooms were lovely, the breakfast elegant, and the spa outstanding.  If you are a golfer, there is a golf course within walking distance.  Highly recommended if you wish to stay outside of Dublin.",5,2013,12,28
217,Beautiful!,"Lovely hotel, but was in a bit of chaos during our stay since we arrived as it was transferring from a Ritz Carlton.  Door cards didn't work on multiple occasions so had to go to front desk to be allowed into the room (a glitch in the transfer of systems).  Gorgeous bathroom and very spacious room; however, the drain in the shower backed up and left water all over the bathroom floor.  Maintenance cleared it, but it backed up again the following day (just not as badly).  Property grounds are quite nice with wonderful views! Be sure to visit Powerscourt Manor, which is amazing!  Took my mother on the trip, and I think the hotel was her favorite part!

Staff was exceptional!  Would definitely stay again!",4,2013,12,28
217,A Merry Christmas,"Our Christmas Day experience was super.
A very warm welcome from the most helpful staff.
We enjoyed a delicious luncheon in a family friendly and festive atmosphere.
We retired for the night quite early and were delighted with the quality and peaceful location of our three mountain view suites - we all slept very well.
Breakfast the following morning was delicious.
Some of the family went swimming and others chose to go walking.
I curled up and read my kindle !!!
A Merry Christmas to remember.

",5,2013,12,28
217,Lunch in Powerscourt Hotel,"I used to really enjoy going for fish and chips in the Ritz-Carlton.  We went on Christmas eve for lunch.  Arriving into an empty bar area, being asked if we had reservations, and then having to check if there is availability when the place was clearly empty, was, I thought a bit off.

We both went for prawn sandwiches, which although very tasty, were totally overpriced, at €14, for three small pieces of brown bread, and 6 prawns, with some garnish.
I do like this hotel, I like the surroundings, the ambience within, the very friendly staff, who were plentiful, efficient and not in any way intrusive!

Next time I'll stick with the fish and chips!!",3,2013,12,26
217,Picture perfect destination,"A delayed review. One of the most atmospheric hotels I have stayed in. Located in County Wicklow, which means well into the countryside away from Dublin, the hotel is housed in an estate that dates back to 1731! Though the current hotel building isn’t that old, there is a wonderful sense of history to this property. Not the least because it is still part of the Powerscourt Estate (the Powerscourt building is exquisite, as are the gardens). And is no longer Ritz Carlton, instead an independent hotel within the Marriott group. 

The entrance gate is imposing, with a cute lodge. Quick note, it is a long, healthy walk to the actual hotel from here, so if in hurry or suffer from general disinclination to walk, do not leave your vehicle here. The actual hotel building is by a hill slope, so lobby is on one of the middle floors. 

The rooms are excellent. Everything checks out, from beds to amenities to washroom shower to switches to tv in the mirror! Room service – avoid if possible. In fact service is Europe standard, though some of the front office guys were friendly and once gave a lift from the neighbouring village, which is a must explore- on-foot.  

The 47 acre grounds are not to be missed. Explore the gardens at the back, or is it front, this is an arc shaped building, so go figure.  Best stay is if you are not really planning to go out. Play golf, explore waterfalls, run about in the grounds. 

Food – breakfast to dinner, was average, best to eat elsewhere if possible. Keep in mind that the village closes early, and Dublin is a long cab ride away.",4,2013,12,26
217,100% PERFECT REGAL LUXURY!!!!,"SERVICE, SERVICE, SERVICE!! That's what makes this luxury hotel one of the best stays we have ever had. Our stay was Dec. 11 - 18, 2013. The smiling staff catered to our every need (Robbie, Trish, Jayne, Katrine, Mathew & more). Examples: they made Euro change so that we could take the bus into Dublin, let us know that the rate for the bus had changed a couple of days before we got there from 2.80 Euros to 3.20, told us about the Wild Wicklow Mountain Tour which was a highlight of our trip, chauffeured us around the grounds & into Enniskerry in the hotel's Range Roover, took A LOT of pictures of us on the grounds & in the hotel, called several different places to secure reservations for us, gave us a trustworthy taxi service to bring us in from Dublin at night, gave us the best pubs to see in Dublin (Brazenhead) & around the resort (Johnny Fox) and they were all around happy to see us everyday. This was truly one of the best vacations we have ever taken. The resort has beautiful large rooms, peaceful surroundings and sweet, charming employees. We will definitely be returning to Powerscourt Estate Hotel.  PS...the walls seem to be very thick because we never heard any other guests slamming doors or talking. We slept like babies.  =)",5,2013,12,24
217,"Regal property, peaceful surroundings, great walking trails, back to nature","This is the place to stay if you want to take in the beauty of the Irish countryside, yet enjoy all the conveniences of a premium property and be close to Dublin.  Spacious, well-appointed rooms, excellent service, good restaurants.  Tiny pub.  Be sure to plan ahead for taxis.  None close.  Visit Enniskerry and the formal gardens adjacent to the hotel.",4,2013,12,18
217,A gem!!,"We stayed here for 1 week in early Dec 2013. Beautiful hotel with very large rooms. The staff were very friendly and professional! The dining room/bar have delicious food and drink options. The full Irish breakfast was good but not worth €28/pp. Take a drive or walk down to Poppies restaurant in the center of Enniskerry for a delicious breakfast for €10-12. I wouldn't recommend driving into Dublin. A 15 min drive to the Bray train station will connect you to Dublin city center in 40 min. If you plan to visit Dublin more than once, I recommend buying a 7 day parking pass at the Bray train station. It will cost you €4/day or €10/week. Buy the 3-7 day train pass which will allow you to ride the Luas (Dublin tram), the city bus and the train unlimited. The Powerscourt overall was a wonderful place to stay, away from the busy city, beautiful views and luxurious accommodations. Be sure to relax in the spa and heated pool/hot tub! Definitely would come back!",5,2013,12,15
217,Love,"Love this hotel, fabulous rooms with walk in wardrobe and great facilites, amazing breakfast, great walks around the ground and views. Showers just amazing and bed is of amazing quality, felt so rested when awoke.",5,2013,12,14
217,"ITS A MUST, MUST, MUST","My husband and I use this hotel every time we are in Ireland visiting family. I have only good things to say about this hotel. We have stayed when it was the ritz and now powerscourt. It's is beautiful, the hotel is the best I've ever stayed in, the service is next to none and the staff are exceptional. Whoever built this hotel had a passion to build something out of this world with no expense  spared. It's hard to believe it got into financial difficulty. Everything works, it's very clean, room service is excellent and the atmosphere delightful.  You must spend the night to see for yourself, anyone that complains about this hotel must be ill.  I think it's the best hotels in this area. Chris and Vicky. London",5,2013,12,08
217,"Whoa...not the Ritz Carlton anymore, now a Mariott","My retired parents and I bought a groupon trip that included 6 nights here, advertised as the ""Ritz Carlton"" in Enniskerry, Ireland (or Powerscourt) airfare and a rental car, all for only $999, which is a steal. 

 But, the one reason, it was to be super is because I travel a lot for my company and get to stay in the Ritz Carlton, even last week I was in the Denver Ritz, so I was excited to show my parents how upscale and different the Ritz is due to the amazing personal service you get.

A few things you should know...The hotel is now owned by Marriott, not the Ritz Carlton.  So don't expect the Ritz.  

Location--The hotel is in a remote area about 20 miles (28 KM) from the Dublin airport, the nearest town is about 4 miles away, and all stores, shops close at 5 PM prompt.  This is typical of Europe because the pubs open at 6 and food stops around 8 pm.

Arriving at the hotel, there was a porter who took our luggage from the car, while we checked in.  The credit card hold is $600, just so you know.

The room we were given was a two queen bed suite, with bathroom, living room, mini bar/fridge, and coat changing room.  It was clean, beds comfortable and beautiful.

One issue.....lighting...all bulbs are like 40 watts, the little ones.  My parents are elderly and cannot see well, so everything was always dark after 4 pm...they were frustrated and the hotel said that is all they have to offer. Okay not so bad....

Food--there is no more famous Chef Ramsey restaurant, this hotel was bought out, but it was advertised when we booked this trip, oh well...not the end of the world.  Breakfast, there is a buffet downstairs in the morning, if you go before 9 am and tell them it's groupon, you get it for half off, but they won't tell you that or advertise, so you have to make sure they write it down when you check in for breakfast.

Service......If you can picture this is not a Ritz, it is now a Marriott, then you won't be disappointed, but if you think you are getting Ritz service, you will be really disappointed. I'm used to the front desk knowing my name when I come and go, usually by the 3rd day they know you or any needs you have.  Yesterday I arrived from shopping with my mom, the front door has a revolving door and two other doors for the porters, which we all prefer because the elderly don't like revolving doors.  Picture mom and I hands full, and the porter behind the door letting my mom try to open the door, then me holding the door for her, with packages in tow, only to let myself in while the porter says hello and does nothing.  At the Ritz, they would never let you open a door for yourself, let alone an elderly woman, then they would offer to take your packages to your room...not here.....

Valet parking, only on weekends, not during the week, the valet is never out outside.  The valet guy is also a room service, and do it all, he's quite nice, just over worked.  

Concierge--the beautiful lit up room is beautiful, but not once have I ever seen that room staffed, and it has a nice big glass see through window with blue lights, but always closed.

We had three of us, and every day, I have to call to ask for 3 towels, some times we get two for the 3 of us.  

Ice--I am used to ice in the morning and night.  I asked the first evening and then asked to please have it scheduled to be delivered at 8 am and 4 pm, has never happened yet.  I keep having to call and ask.  At the Ritz, asking for anything would be disappointing.  I've had a cold before and they put a dehumidifier in my room while I was at dinner with out asking.  That's the difference....they get to know you.

Okay, so we are not high maintenance, just looking for the experience.  My elderly mom brings bags of popcorn and since there are no microwaves in the room, she asked the first day to have the room service guy pop it, which he did and returned.  Tonight mom asks again and this person says well you can walk downstairs to the café and ask them to do it, and while you are there ask them to give you ice.  Again, if you think Marriott, this would be normal.

I know they want to grow, but if they want to keep up with what the Ritz does, they have a long way to go. 

Travelling....even with a rental car, Waterford, Cork, Limmerick, Belfast each of these places are a two hour drive from the hotel.  If I had to do it again, I would stay one night, then hotel hop so I could enjoy not having to return back each day to the hotel.  I didn't realize this when I was quick to book this trip, but you could not do this with out a car for sure.

Also, any Americans, know that In Ireland they drive on the opposite side of the street, most of your rental cards are standards not automatic, which means the gearshift is also on the opposite side, the streets are very narrow, many a times we almost sideswiped a wall or an oncoming car.  Buy insurance, full insurance, because you most likely will get a ding or two from other cards or cars that park too close to you.

Good luck!",3,2013,12,07
217,Perfection,"We spent 4 nights for our honeymoon here in October and wish we had stayed longer. Everything about the hotel is perfect, we didn't find one fault with the place. The spa is out of this world. We had the couples treatment room which is so worth for a treat. The spa staff, like any of the hotel staff we dealt  were all so lovely. The room was perfect as was breakfast. Cant wait to return on our anniversary!",5,2013,12,02
217,"Very ""Ritzy"" and Nice But Out of the Way","We stayed here in mid-June 2013 and enjoyed our stay.  The hotel is, of course, top quality as one would expect from a Ritz-Carlton property.  The hotel grounds are magnificent.  Our room was quite grand and spacious.  The view was great, including the life size chess board outside.  The area around the hotel is quite stunning as well.  There are the gardens and waterfall not too far to visit.

The hotel is a great destination hotel especially for events such as weddings and, in fact, there was a wedding during our stay.  We might not have noticed except for the loud reception and party outside our window and what we suspect were very loud guests in the room above.  I'd expect the rooms to be a bit more soundproof.

If you are looking to be close to eating establishments or commerce this is not the place to stay.  It was at least 20-30 minutes (if you don't get turned around) to any sort of commerce.  We may try a place closer to Dublin next time but that's a matter of preference for us.

If you're looking to get away and have a romantic, secluded holiday this is a great place.  We were just on a regular holiday and wanted to be a bit closer to commerce.",4,2013,12,01
217,Top notch hotel,"OMG, what an experience from once you drive in and park..and then go through the glass revolving door..the entrance is like a scene from a movie  - the furnishings and woodwork, the Christmas trees and Santas grotto..its magical..hard to believe that you were in ireland. Check was flawless..the ground floor is the 4th floor? We were on the 5th floor overlooking the sugarloaf mountain..spectacular view. The whole ambiance is grandiose without being stuffy..a lovely clientele. Our room was bright and airy. Features were high tec with touchscreen for lights, heat, a/c, etc. We had a cocktail in the reception area, quite expensive but what would one expect from the standard of the place..it was a great start, We dined in the SIKA restaurant, the breads just melted in your mouth, starter of salmon and crab, monkfish and fennel main course and lemon tart dessert, lovely bottle of Merlot. Going from the restaurant to McGills bar was like an oasis in the dessert - it was as lively as a pub in Dublin City Centre..2 man band were super, talented musicians and we met lovely people and had a bit of a dance and a sing song. The beds were so so comfortable..great nights sleep. Breakfast was the best selection ever..and so fresh and tasty.a lovely experience. We did not have time to use the spa and facilities but we were shown around and we were so disappointed to be leaving so soon. We will be back for sure..The staff were very helpful and great to see so many..and willing to help. Two small things: Complimentary paper was not delivered, waitress was spraying cleaning solution wiping table clean beside people dining during dinner..not very appropriate as there were plenty of free tables. All in all, a fantastic night away in such a spectacular location..hope to return for a longer period and fit a lot more in.",5,2013,11,30
217,"Would LOVE to review this property, but...","Booked a tour to Ireland in Fall 2013 and included one night to spend decadent amounts of money to dine at the chef's table at Gordon Ramsay. Confirmed that the 290 Euro charge for one night included a 70 Euro credit toward dinner, nailed down the chef's table, and decided to spend the night at Powerscourt. All arrangements were confirmed 8/23/13 for 11/23/13. On September 7th, I was informed via email that the hotel would no longer be operating as a Ritz-Carlton, but that I would still pay 290 Euro for the accommodations. In addition, the restaurant would no longer be Gordon Ramsay. When, in early November, the new restaurant wrote regarding our reservations, and I requested confirmation of the chef's table, as reserved and originally confirmed, I was advised that their policy was not to reserve the chef's table for less than 6 people (that wasn't the policy when I reserved it); the hotel advised that they would not honor the 70 Euro resort credit that was part of our original package. I got no response when I inquired as to why the original terms of our hotel reservation would not be honored, and the restaurant refused to honor our original reservation, too. I found accommodations elsewhere; hence, I cannot review anything but the dismal customer service I received after making guaranteed, confirmed reservations from another continent.",2,2013,11,30
217,Very beautiful,Beautiful views! The rooms are perfect-- clean & luxurious. The only problem I had was when I went to go plug in my hair straightener in the converter box (like I was told would adjust the voltage to the difference ) FRIED it out. Ruined my very expensive straightener. They did refund my money. I think it was just a faulty box. So I really can't complain because I bought a new one when I got home with that money. enniskerry has such a beautiful  landscape so tour the grounds! I will stay there again!,5,2013,11,30
217,Perfection!,"Just returned after three nights rest and relaxation. Location is stunning, rooms amazing and staff delightful. We had breakfast in the room and ate in MacGills Bar and the Sugar Loaf Lounge - all food was delicious and plenty of it.  The spa was luxury itself and I had the best facial treatment ever (age-defying!). Popped down to the village of Enniskerry in the courtesy car - lovely little village, worth a look. Visited the Powerscourt House and Garden complex - adore the Avoca shop and restaurant. We were also able to do the river walk despite my partner having a bad back as the lovely concierge arranged for a comp golf buggy so we didn't have to walk down the hill and back - perfect solution. Thank you to all the staff for making our stay such a good one. Definitely be back :-)",5,2013,11,28
217,Erin and my trip to Ireland,"Everyone was extremely courteous, friendly and helpful.  The hotel and grounds were well kept and beautiful. The rooms were spacious and comfortable.  Very clean and quiet.  We spent time at the spa, soaking in the hot tub and resting on the chaise chairs.  We had breakfast everyday at the buffet, the selection was unbelievable and delicious.",5,2013,11,27
217,Excellent Overnight Stay,"Stayed at this hotel in August when it was part of the Ritz-Carlton Chain. We decided to book as we were travelling back from Dublin on our way home from a family holiday in Ireland.
initial impressions of the hotel were very good, check-in staff made children very welcome with separate check-in area for them. We were upgraded due to me being a member of Ritz-Carlton Rewards. Exec Suite over looking Sugar Loaf mountains was huge, with separate lounge, bathroom and a dressing area/room where staff had put a tent up for the children to stay in along with midnight snacks and drinks. Every aspect of Room amenities controlled by a tablet control on the wall, which the children loved and had the curtains opening and closing all the time. 3 TV's including one in the bathroom, all areas of the suite were spotlessly clean. Spa was very good and we spend a good couple of hours there before exploring the grounds where there was a kids playground and a small football pitch.
Ate in the Irish pub, which was fine, and food well cooked and presented.
Buffet Breakfast very good and food replenished regularly. Staff all very helpful and were offering to take us to see the Waterfall in the hotels Range Rover if we wanted, but we dint have time.
Would definitely go back.",5,2013,11,27
217,In a word... Perfect!,"Had the pleasure of spending a couple of nights at the Powerscourt and it was a fabulous stay. The hotel is pure class. Situated on the outskirts of the small charming town of Enniskerry, it has lots to offer those looking to venture out from Dublin into the Irish Countryside.

The rooms were as nice as any that we have ever stayed at. The service on par with the best that we have ever experienced. Robbie, the concierge was simply outstanding and provided incredible insight to all the things to see and do in the area. They offer a shuttle in their Land Rover Defender to and from town, which is a great perk.

Oh and the spa and pool area was incredible. Best that we have seen by far.

I can't imagine there being any other hotel in the countryside that could come close to rival this. Would return without hesitation.",5,2013,11,26
217,Perfect weekend away,Arrived down to stay at Powerscourt hotel with high expectations. After walking along the avenue in Powerscourt estate you come to the hotel. We checked in and were taken to our room. It was a fabulous room with plenty of space. The free bike rental and river walk were superb. The breakfast and pool and spa area where brilliant. Cannot wait to stay again. The hotel is perfect to get away from everything and the rate was very good. Big thanks to everyone on the front desk really made us feel welcome.Big credit to the hotel.,5,2013,11,26
217,"If you're going to holiday somewhere in Ireland, don't miss this!","A fabulous Hotel and Spa well worth visiting. The staff, facilities and scenery are just great and you'll leave with just one regret - that you're not staying for longer! 

Whether it's to enjoy some great golf, to rewind & relax or to enjoy some beautiful landscapes, this place has it all. The staff are fantastic and really go that extra mile in terms of making your stay as enjoyable as possible.",5,2013,11,25
217,Night away with work colleagues,"This Hotel certainly ticks all the boxes, it is certainly of 5 Star quality and the staff are amazingly friendly and helpful.  We played golf on Saturday, the facilities and course are maticulously maintained.  On checking into the hotel, we were shown to our room by a porter who explained everthing through the room in fine detail and in a jovial manner.  Could not find fault in this hotel and would love to return for a two or three night stay in the near future!!",5,2013,11,25
217,amazing property,"We bought a vacation package that included a 6 night stay at the Powerscourt.  This place is amazing and we had such a great time.  The hotel is just south of Dublin and was a prefect location.  The gated hotel grounds are absolutely beautiful overlooking gorgeous mountains.  The hotel staff was extremely friendly and helpful and our room was huge and had every amenity.  Don't miss the 44 acre  Powerscourt gardens next door.  We were there in November and, even with most of the flowers gone, it was breathtaking.  The paths wind along beautiful trees, small lakes and fountains.  Enniskerry is adorable, although walking there from Powerscourt may be dangerous in places.  Make sure you stop at Poppies Cafe!  From the Powerscourt, it was a short drive over to the coastal city of Bray where we caught the train into Dublin.  Another day, the concierge mapped us a driving route down through the Wicklow Mountains and back up along the coast.  At every turn, we all were totally in awe of the beauty.  There are some fabulous golf course close by with some holes running along the sea.  It was hard to leave this wonderful hotel and this beautiful country.  I really have nothing negative to say about our stay at the Powerscourt.  We got a great rate through our trip package.  I'm not sure what the regular rate is, but I probably can't afford to go back there as often as I'd like---although it would be worth the splurge!",5,2013,11,22
217,Very Nice hotel,"We stayed here for two night, the main reason we chose this hotel was the fact we could take our dog with us, For an extra €50 your dog can stay in the room (must be a small dog) The hotel and grounds are lovely. As we had our dog we could not eat in the restaurants which was understandable, the room service menu I must say is the worse I have seen in a 5 star hotel. in fact it was just to cards of paper. When I received it I went to the reception to ask for the real menu because I thought we did not have the proper one. The staff are very friendly and helpful and even when we had a drink in the lobby they got a bowl of water for our dog. The rooms are huge and include a walk in wardrobe. The room service was only ok but I feel this is down to the poor choice on the menu.",4,2013,11,21
217,Very Good but few comments,"We very recently stayed here for a night away as part of our honeymoon.

Beautiful hotel with excellent staff and food. Our suite was amazing. Vet spacious and bright. 

Being a 5 star hotel, food and drinks are quite expensive.

We had some massages and this was the highlight of our stay. Mandy, the masseuse was AMAZING and worth her weight in gold! 

Just a few comments on items which surprised us given the cost of a stay at this property;

No complimentary drinking water in our room, the only water available was in the mini bar. Never encountered this in a 5 star hotel before. 

We were offered a complimentary newspaper which never arrived.

Very limited toiletries in the bedroom, one small bottle of shower gel for two people is just not enough. 

Taking all of the above into consideration, we really enjoyed our stay.
",4,2013,11,17
217,"Excellent, as always!","I have just returned from my second stay at Powerscourt Hotel, the former Ritz Carlton.  My husband had arranged a surprise trip for my birthday and needless to say, we were not disappointed.  The hotel has only just changed its owners and is, without a doubt, our favourite place to stay on the island of Ireland. It is situated in the beautiful Powerscourt Estate in County Wicklow, a short distance from the centre of Dublin.  From the moment you walk through the door, you are made to feel so special and so welcome by all the staff.  The hotel itself is opulent and extremely relaxing but not at all stuffy.  It oozes quality and style, evidence that it was built at the height of the Celtic Tiger boom.  Our room, a standard double, was enormous, and had no less than five wardrobes! The bathroom was also huge and like everyone else, we love the television built into the mirror!  The room was beautifully furnished and the bed extremely comfortable.  We had a celebratory dinner in what was the Gordon Ramsey restaurant but is now the Sika.  The meal was superb, as indeed was the service we received from our waiter. Every dish was explained but even though the restaurant was extremely quiet that particular night, we were not rushed in any way.  The Espa spa is out of this world.  The pool is most unusual being very dark. The floor is studded with Swarovski crystals and there is an unbelievable Turkish steam room which we did not try!  The whole experience is totally relaxing and is an added bonus to your stay.

All in all, a wonderful place to stay, hopefully Marriott will maintain the high standards of Ritz Carlton, and as a couple we hope very much to return on a regular basis.",5,2013,11,09
217,"Great hotel, even if reach somewhat exceeds grasp","Formerly the Ritz-Carlton Powerscourt, this luxurious hotel built on the Powerscourt estate property (presumably with some sort of land deal with the government since the Irish government now owns much of the estate itself) is very much a creature of the excesses of the ""Celtic Tiger"" days.  It is undeniably magnificent (in a slightly exaggerated, imitative way -- the 18th c Palladians didn't put TV screens in their bathroom mirrors), and located in Wicklow, a beautiful part of Ireland just south of Dublin.  It is easily reached from the airport and is situated just outside of the charming village of Enniskerry, about a two-kilometer hike from the hotel itself.  From Enniskerry, regular buses run into Dublin (about an hour) and nearby Bray, where you can catch the train into the city center.  The hotel staff was friendly, eager and helpful, though sometimes a bit raw (it seems that the hotel is being used in part for interns and training) and the rooms were big, nicely appointed and the beds comfortable.  The transition from the R-C (the changeover occurred on October 1) was evident in minor ways (all the letterhead was being changed, so there was no hotel information in the room, for example), but overall it seemed like business as usual. The pool and spa are delightful. The McGill Pub was a good imitation of an Irish pub, but why not walk down the street to a real one?",4,2013,11,04
217,Do We have to leave?,"Nothing bad to say about this place at all. Little piece of Heaven in the Garden of Ireland.  The room was mind boggling!  HUGE, HUGE, HUGE. Everything was controlled by a touchscreen located next to bed and there was even a tv in the  mirror in the bathroom! This room was beyond accessible! Plenty of room for a wheelchair. Bathroom was HUGE and very wheelchair friendly. The glass doors of the shower completly folded open and you could wheel your chair right up next to the shower chair provided. This shower could have easily accomdated 5 people!! We were greeted by a valet upon arrive who was with us from the time he opned the car door to let us out to through check in and until he unloaded our  bags in our room and explained how everything worked.  There were 3 of us staying the room  so they had to bring in a roll away bed as the room had 1 king bed. the roll away bed was not a cot but an actual single bed. Beds were extremely comfortable and made it very hard to get out of in the mornings. pillows A+
They had a converter box to plug multiple devices in so you didn't need to worry about having a converter. We used their laundry service which I believed was reasonably priced and extremely prompt. Dining....was wonderful and you couldn't have asked for a better view than Sugarloaf mountain!
Hotel staff extremely friendly and helpful and couldn't do enough for you. DIdn't make me feel like a nuisance in my wheelchair.",5,2013,11,03
217,A fantastic hotel,"What a fabulous hotel, wonderful location, friendly staff, superb service.  Accommodation was extremely comfortable and spotless. Heavenly spot, excellent place to relax a little spot of heaven. Plenty to do on site and the shuttle service into the local village was very handy. A trip to the gardens and a visit to the house is well worth a short walk.",5,2013,11,02
217,Everything you could want from a hotel.,"Walking in really indicated what to expect, the big open lobby with views of the mountain was beautiful. Our room was spacious on the 5th floor for two people with two double beds. The bathroom was fantastic with a shower separate from the the bath which was a bonus, also when getting a bath the telly in the mirror with surround sound made it all the more relaxing. The ONE and only fault with this hotel i felt was the variety of channels on the television. Do not get me wrong the 3 sports channels were great as i was able to watch soccer but the variety was not up to standard to other hotels i have been to. The dinner and breakfast were fantastic with dinner being heavenly and breakfast the same. The pool and gym were also fantastic with the gym being a relaxing getaway and the gym easy to be in from the views in front of you. We will be back great hotel.",5,2013,11,02
217,"Total luxury, a hidden gem","Hotel very luxurious, fantastic facilities, location, staff are amazing helpful, wonderful towards children, lots activity for childern indoor and outdoor, food is very very good, all in all wonderful treat and not far from Dublin city, definitely a must for couples for a treat or those with young family needing plenty of options for play, highly recommend this hotel
Kingfisher cafe is excellent in the village for lunch and snacks
Good value for money in overnight B&B rate",5,2013,10,31
217,"Wonderful Stay, but issues","First off, there is much to recommend this lovely hotel with a kind and friendly staff.  During our stay the hotel apparently had just transitioned from being a Ritz Carlton Hotel, so I attribute our issues to the changeover.  If you are staying there in the future, I would recommend checking reviews after the transition to see if these issues still remain.

We booked using my husband's Platinum card for the benefits.  This was one of the smartest things we EVER did.  The room upgrade we received stunned us - we were given a corner room suite with a fabulous view facing Sugar Loaf mountain.  We had NO complaints about the room itself which was spacious to the point of crazy, yet very comfortable and practical.  The only caution to know was the drain in the shower was inadequate for the water coming from the shower with no lip between the door and floor, so we ended up with a huge puddle of water on the bathroom floor.  Needed to use a couple of towels to mop up and dam all that water!  Bath tub was like a spa, so there was an alternative.  :)  We also enjoyed our breakfasts that came with the Platinum card upgrades.  We felt there was plenty of choice to suit our dietary needs.  We both especially liked the poached spiced fruit, small scones and eggs (whites) made to order.

We loved walking the grounds and down to the village.  Powerscourt Gardens is only a short walk away and worth spending a relaxing time wandering there.  The hotel's location alone is enough to draw us back.

Our issues concerned dinner dining.  We checked in on a Monday and were shown where the bar and restaurant dining areas were but NOT told that only the mezzanine informal dining was open on Monday.  We had a light snack upon arrival, planning to try the formal restaurant that evening.  It was not so convenient to find ourselves back at the same place with the same limited menu a few hours later.  We would have just had a heartier meal earlier in the day had we known, and the pub was also closed as were nearby village eateries by that late in the evening.  WARNING: Limited dining options on Monday evenings, and they may not tell you this!

Second dining warning - while the room service we used the second night (everything closes at 10 pm, with no village alternatives)  was prompt and the sandwich ok - Never, ever order the pizza  there.  Never.  I didn't expect perfect pizza but what I got can best be described as a frozen, not fully cooked item, that tasted like white bread with ketchup on top, with huge hunks of mushy tomato and greasy cheese.  It was inedible.  And expensive.  It would have had better flavor had it been burnt.  Frankly shocking that a hotel of this quality would serve it and charge 18 euros for it.

We also had a little trouble getting our car parked and retrieved.  We solved this by self parking most of the visit, which was not a problem at all, once you know.

All in all we loved our stay.  We would return, but maybe bring sandwiches.  :)",4,2013,10,30
217,Very good but some issues,"As a family of 2 adults and 2 children (7 & 5) we very much enjoyed our one night stay.  The room was huge with a large walk in wardrobe area.  There is a warm and friendly ambience in the hotel and the staff are, in the main, excellent.  However, there were some small issues which we would not expect to find in a hotel of this category.  Breakfast was ok, nothing exceptional and in fact the choice of cereals and hot food was quite limited.  Also the elevator music that was playing during breakfast was far too loud and in fact wasn't necessary at all.  It would have been much more sensible in my view to have some very discreet piano or classical music instead of the awful dross that was playing and disturbing early morning conversation.  Another issue was the very heavy detergent smell that greeted us and also remained with us in our room.  Perhaps it was preferable to the odour that preceded it...I dread to think!  Anyway at least it was a clean smell and for that we were thankful.  The sound quality from the TV was poor and I'm not sure the TV in the bathroom would really enhance anyone's stay but I guess that I can only speak for myself on that one.  The swimming pool is certainly much more catered for individuals and couples rather than families as it was quite dark and moody!

All in all the stay was enjoyable but there is some work to be done to get the finishing touches to the expected standard",4,2013,10,29
217,Nice experience overall - service much improved over the years!,"The last time I stayed here it was a Ritz Carlton hotel and it was right at the height of the Celtic Tiger madness in Ireland. Nothing worked, the service was deplorable and it was well over-priced. I had long since decided not to bother returning. As it happened a gift of a weekend for myself and my mother made this a voyage of discovery - and we were pleasantly surprised. The service was attentive, the room was exactly the same (in need of an updating as looking VERY old fashioned) and the grounds were lovely. Food in the restaurant was fine but I was surprised that they insisted that we had to eat at 6.30 as they were full thereafter - the place remained at most 3/4 full the entire night! Overall the value was pretty good and we included a short visit to the spa which was very nice. Only downside was that when we inquired about the walks we were not told that we needed a key pass and as a result we could not find them! A nice stay, and the best bit was definitely the staff.",4,2013,10,28
217,"first time to Ireland, first stay at Powerscourt","Service was excellent.  Facilities exceptional.  Nothing left out.  We had a suite on the main level and it was great.  Big, big room with big living room, huge walk-in closet, and of course, elegant marble and tile master bath with walk-in shower (marble/tile) with rain head and TV in the dual vanity mirror.  Huge king bed was extremely comfortable with downy pillows.  Pool and spa was amazing.  Made us want to go get our suits on immediately and enjoy the gigantic whirlpool, large pool with lounge chairs all around, in a great romantic atmosphere.  Steam room felt great and the locker even had a bathing suit drying machine.  Staff was extremely friendly and took care of every need, and want. Grounds of the gardens, gift shops and cafe on the grounds were all terrific. Beautiful scenery, setting and serenity.  I didn't want to leave.",5,2013,10,23
217,Fantastic way to end our Ireland trip,"This was the last stop on the trip, and we saved the best for last.  Beautiful rooms and friendly, helpful staff.  We took bicycles out the first day and were a little disappointed at how run-down they were, but aside from that we couldn't complain.  We ate at the pub one night and ordered room service the next.  The nearby town was charming and it was easy to take the commuter train into Dublin from the Bray stop.  I wish we could have stayed longer.",5,2013,10,19
217,AMAZING,Absolutely amazing hotel very professional staff nothing was too much trouble. Fantastic food in all restaurants especially Gordon Ramsey's. Buffet breakfast  must of had 60 different items all perfectly prepared. The only let down was the afternoon tea not quite the standard you would expect difficult to get some sandwich fillings changed and a little bit rushed. Overall highly recommended for that special occasion.,5,2013,10,18
217,"Beautiful Grounds, Lovely Suite","I booked our stay months ago through Marriott Rewards when it was still a Ritz-Carlton property.  Unbeknownst to me, the hotel was in the process of being sold.  On October 1st, 2013, it ceased being a Ritz hotel and, with it, Gordon Ramsay's restaurant stopped operating.  The hotel is still a Marriott but is now just Powerscourt Hotel and Ramsay's chefs are cooking under a new restaurant called Sika.  I was a little disappointed about this but the well-appointed suite, the beautiful grounds, the turn-down service with yummy chocolates, and the horses more than made up for the disappointment.  Sika is an outstanding restaurant with reasonable prices.  The service was a bit slow and the chef made a mistake with our order: he prepared beef instead of lamb for our entrees so we had to wait while the lamb was being cooked.  The food was delicious!  
We stayed in a one-bedroom suite.  The room was beautiful and the bathroom had both a jet spray as well as a rainforest shower.  There is a big closet space with floor to ceiling closets.  This is a separate area near the front foyer.  Lights, temperature and window drape controls are all electronic using touch pads.
Powerscourt is 30-45 minutes away from Dublin.  We rented a car.  I have to take one star from my rating because of the distance from Dublin.",4,2013,10,16
217,Enjoyable night away but not a 5* hotel…,"We live in Dublin and decided on a last minute whim, to head away for a night to the Powerscourt Hotel in Enniskerry. We love the scenery in Wicklow and the location of the Powerscourt and the views do not disappoint. Our room was beautiful, spacious, and spotless, with a lovely view over the front of the hotel. We were disappointed to find that there was no record of our request for a late check-out but didn’t want to make an issue of it as we had just arrived and were looking forward to a relaxing night away. We headed to the pool/spa area in the afternoon which we enjoyed. I had a massage treatment booked for 4.15pm and checked in with spa reception at 4.10pm but between the jigs and the reels, it wasn’t logged on the system that I had checked in so when the girl who was performing my treatment realised I was waiting for her, it was then 4:40pm and she didn’t have enough time for my 50min treatment (in the meantime I had been left alone in a corridor waiting and it was only by chance I was noticed). I was offered the option of a free back massage and to come back the following day for the treatment I’d booked but that didn’t suit as we’d made plans for the Sunday. In the end, I got a free 15 min back massage in lieu of my appointment. While it was disappointing, once they realised their mistake I felt the issue was handled well and the Manager did come and speak to me and apologise so I was happy with how it was handled.

That night we headed to McGill’s bar for food and a few drinks. The options on the menu are limited but I went for the curry which was pretty bland. The pub was fairly busy with a good atmosphere and would recommend it for a few drinks but would suggest to either eat in the restaurant or go to the local village for dinner. 

On Sunday, we headed down for breakfast around 9am and we had the place to ourselves which was lovely. Thoroughly enjoyed the breakfast. There was a great range of food including plenty of pastries/cakes to satisfy a sweet tooth! We’d a lovely table by the window and sat for over an hour, eating and reading the papers – heaven! We then checked out and were told the breakfast wasn’t included in the offer and that there was an additional €56 on our bill. We were confident this was incorrect and that our deal had included breakfast but had discarded our booking reference details in the bin in the room. They allowed us to go back to the room and recover it and yes our reference confirmed that breakfast had in fact been included. Once again, they apologised etc. for the mix-up. but after the appointment issue on the Saturday, it was additional hassle we didn’t need and not the sort of basic error you would expect at a 3, 4 or 5* hotel. 

While there were elements of the trip that we enjoyed and the hotel certainly has great potential, taking the basic errors above into consideration (all of which occurred in the space of a one night stay) it is certainly not becoming of a 5 star experience.",3,2013,10,15
217,Pure Luxury!!! Heaven!!!,"My husband and I have just returned from an over night stay at the very gorgeous Powerscourt Hotel!! On arrival we were greeted wonderfully on check in and our room was ready we had a fabulous room on the 6th floor a  king mountain view suite it was so very beautiful  and spacious I could of moved in  and stayed and  it was exceptionally clean! The suite had 2 bathrooms and a gorgeous wrap around balcony just pure luxury!! As it was our anniversary  the Hotel had a  beautiful plate of chocolates delivered to our room with  compliments and a lovely letter wishing us a very happy anniversary and birthday for myself a very nice personal touch!! the Hotel is very beautiful and the grounds are simply stunning go early and take in all the lovely walks and gorgeous village of  Enniskerry it is so cute and a quaint little Irish village. The Irish pub in the Hotel McGills is brilliant and a very .irish pub it had gorgeous food  have the potatoe skins  which are simply Devine and the bar staff are brilliant very friendly. We eat in the main resturant which you must book when booking the Hotel as it gets booked up very fast. it's just lovely the food is beautiful just beware that the water they offer you at the start of  the meal will cost you 6 euro a bottle and also when they offer you ""bubbles"" you will be charged 10 euro a glass each  just check your bill the next day if it's for you great but just to let you know! the food  and service is really outstanding and I would not of had such a lovely meal in a long time! The breakfast is fabulous and  the leisure pool area is just beautiful! In general it  is a very romantic Hotel with fabulous views and a really beautiful .part if Ireland to visit with exceptionally good management and staff who really go the  extra mile to ensure a very pleasant memorable stay!! Thank you especially to Roberto who looked after us with via email before hand and helped in making our anniversary very special!! I just can't wait to back again and be spoilt!!! Thank you Powerscourt Hotel!!",5,2013,10,14
217,Absolutely perfect,"Looking from the outside you would think this hotel and a 4 year old child would not be a good mix. Nothing could be further from the truth! From the minute we pulled up at the door my little man was treated as if he was the most important person they had staying there.
 Attention to detail in this hotel is impeccable, they have thought of everything and staff go out of their way to make sure your stay is a memorable one. 
 There is no such thing as a perfect hotel but in my opinion Powerscourt comes as close as you can get. ",5,2013,10,14
217,"Good for a getaway, but...","We bought a Groupon deal that had a six night stay at this hotel. It's rated five star, and probably deserves it, but if you are planning a first trip to Ireland, like we were, don't make this your only stay. It's a good 20-30 minutes from Dublin, and not close to anything, so you need to be prepared to either make it a getaway stay or add Astra driving time for your excursions. We had a six night deal, but only stayed four so we could see more of the country. Also, not a lot of dining options nearby--the place is really geared toward folks wo want to settle in and experience the Powercourt. OK, but we won't be coming back or recommending to friends who want to see the real Ireland.",4,2013,10,10
217,Powerscourt Visit,Stopped in this hotel on both ends of a golf trip to Ireland this september. What a great arrival and departure hotel. Best accomodations of all our hotels. 5 star service. Has dinner at the chefs table in Gordon Ramsay's which was fantastic. Great looking spa facility although dod not have time to sample. Reccomend without reservations.,5,2013,10,09
217,"A Grand and Lovely Location, some transitional challenges","The location could not be more gorgeous.    The hotel is spectacular upon approach and the rooms are delightful.  The pool and spa were the most incredible I have ever seen, with fiber optic lighting that made you feel as if you were swimming through the stars.  The large quartz featured in the steam room hums with healing power.  The views are breath-taking and the 3rd floors decks, a place of gentle repose and comfort.   The staff is helpful and attentive.  The Pub serves great food and wonderful ambiance for the golfers having a Guinness after their rounds.  The Gordan Ramsey restaurant is spectacular and the B & B breakfast buffet over the top delicious.

However, when we stayed last week, there was a problem with the wells from a dry summer and the water coming into the rooms a medium brown, good, perhaps for Scotch production, but prohibitive from bathing in the lovely soaking tubs.   We had to ask for bottled water ever day as you didn't dare drink the stuff.  Although we had booked the spa package, we had to move rooms because our first did not have wi-fi and I had to connect for work.  After the 2 hours spent sorting out the new room, all the spa appointments were booked.  I was disappointed with this coupled with the time it took to transition then the brown water issue made it less than what we hoped, but still, better than most.

I took a bike our for a long ride one morning through town and the other trails that connect with the Wicklow way.  The roads around the spa are lovely riding, and there is a gated trail system by the water than must be explored.   The Powerscourt Gardens are INCREDIBLE and I highly recommend the 5 minute walk down the trail to see them.   There is 10% off in the AVOCA gift store, a lovely design shop, and other Irish goodies for the shopper.

Nearby Wicklow National Park is a place to delight and enjoy.   We hiked about the waterfall and into the Heather for a great 3 hour walk-a-bout.

The Manager was very helpful in hearing our concerns and adjusting our rate for the trouble.   They changed ownership the day we left and we wish the establishment great prosperity.   Way more gifts than troubles.",4,2013,10,09
217,"Stunning Hotel, Gorgeous Spa",My sister and I had the pleasure of arriving on the first day this hotel switched from the Ritz to Autograph.  There was disorganization and many glitches.  One would think a changeover of this magnitude would have been well planned in advance.  Not so!  Nevertheless the hotel is elegant and beautiful.  The stunning scenery is well worth a visit.  Make sure to visit the gardens next door - they were INCREDIBLE.  The hotel has a very fun labyrinth as well!  The spa is incredible elegant as well.  Unfortunately I had a massage from there that was THE WORST massage I have ever had.  Beware of high expectations in this department when you sign up for a massage!,3,2013,10,08
217,A magnificent hotel in a stunning location.,"Less than  week after opening it's doors my wife and I had dinner in the new Powerscourt Hotel, set in Wicklow, the garden of Ireland and only a half hour drive from central Dublin.
The food, service and ambiance was superb. The setting is magnificent with stunning views of the Sugar Loaf mountain from every table in the dinning room. The staff couldn't have been friendlier and informative but the food was the best I have had for a long, long time. As they have only opened I expected some glitches but I literally couldn't fault anything. 
If you want a fine dining experience in a stunning setting then this is it. And if you are visiting Dublin a visit here will show you the natural beauty of Ireland.",5,2013,10,06
217,ideal for couple looking for amazing romantic week end,"I stayed at the Ritz for 2 days and so far I can say the ritz is in my top 3 hotel.
the location is perfect if you are looking fo a peaceful time, the facilities are the same (included gym and spa).
if I have to complain about things i would say that I had a very bad check in, very long. Ridiculous.
the directions in the hotel are not good. Depending which bedroom you are (was 120) it can be a nightmare to find it.",5,2013,10,05
217,Beautiful place to stay!,"This was a great end to our 10 day trip.  Rest and relax here.  Great pub fare, friendly service, beautiful grounds, wonderful/peaceful spa.  The only thing I did not like was the room service food and the 1:30 AM crash I heard from the room nearby.  The room was beautiful, with plenty of space to move about.  I would have spent more time in the gardens if I had known about them sooner!  :o)  Mind you I was pregnant on this trip so I was a little sensitive to ""things"" in general.  ;o)",5,2013,10,03
217,Insane!,"There are some aspects of this resort, which make it the best property I have ever stayed - and I have stayed at some good ones.

This property is the epitome of luxury; everything from the bedding to the incredible shower to the cool television in the mirror.

I also had a massage in the Spa, which was excellent. The facilities are overall the best I have ever seen. 

If I had one minor criticism, I didn't think the gym was fitting for a hotel of such high caliber.",5,2013,10,02
217,Simply Amazing,"I stayed here for a week over the St. Patrick's Day 2013 weekend. It was amazing! From the second we got onto the grounds everything was first class. The staff were willing to assist us in any requests we had. The room was the Standard / Classic Deluxe room but was overwhelmed by the size and the amenities. Housekeeping was very prompt and even folded our clothes and balled up my friend's socks which were on the floor each day. On the last night everything was neatly folded and stacked at the foot of our beds so it could be placed into our suitcases.

If we wanted to get down into the village, the front desk would arrange for a car to drive us down; when we were ready to come back, the car would come and pick us up! We ate breakfast in town at Poppies which was good and inexpensive.

Made a reservation to eat at Ramsay's one night when they had a set 3 course menu. Great value. We were the last ones in the restaurant so we got to see the Chef's Table in the kitchen. Spotless! Have your camera ready if you are going to order the Chocolate Sphere for dessert. :)

Make sure to spend time in the Pool/Spa area, a great way to relax after a long day travelling around the island. We didn't get any of the packages, but the pool area and wet sauna were really nice. Try and spend a morning at the gardens nearby or head down to the waterfall.

On the weekend, we drove to Bray (about 15min), parked the car and took the train into Dublin. It was easier and didn't have to worry about paying the toll each way and dealing with road closures and parking in the city. One of the biggest expenses for the trip was gas for the car. Getting to Cork or Blarney were almost 3hr drives each way in a Ford Fiesta. We should have stayed in Limerick one night so we could get up early to the Cliffs the next morning and then drive back to the Ritz.

As of October, it's no longer part of the Ritz-Carlton chain but still operational.",5,2013,10,02
217,Magical!,"Fantastic from start to finish!  The grounds--unbelievable.  The rooms--spacious and delightfully appointed, the spa--like no other.  Fairly easy to get here from Dublin.  For the time/money its worth it to take a cab vs the bus.

For only about two hundred rooms this hotel felt huge in a good way, with a few dining options and many helpful staff members, and of course the grounds are amazing.

Go to the pub!! The food is delicious and it definitely felt genuine, especially for a hotel bar.",5,2013,09,28
217,Stunning property,"This hotel is one of the most beautiful in the world.  The grounds are spectacular; the setting unique.  It was very comfortable - the bed, the quiet, the cleanliness... all outstanding.  Nothing short of a Ritz Carlton hotel experience.  The staff was exceptional; very accommodating and friendly. The staff will drive you down to Eniskerry Village, or Powerscourt Manor (which is a short walk), and pick you up.  I borrowed a bike and was given a nice map and directions, along with a pass to go to the beautiful Riverwalk.  Truly a gorgeous property!",5,2013,09,27
217,Very luxurious hotel in a great location,"I stayed here for 2 nights during a conference which was held at the hotel. The standard rooms are incredibly spacious and are very well appointed. The decor is elegant and the bathrooms very plush. I loved the TV that was seamlessly built into the bathroom mirror. It is a true luxury property and lives up to the Ritz-Carlton name. Note that it is due to lose the Ritz-Carlton branding on 1st October, I’m not sure what changes may result from this!

The hotel is in a beautiful setting surrounded by the Irish countryside. On a clear day, you can enjoy beautiful views from one side of the hotel. It is very isolated, making it a good place to relax and unwind. I liked the fact that if breakfast was included in your room rate, you could have it delivered to your room as an alternative to going down to the restaurant. Many others have commented on the positive aspects of the hotel, and I would agree for the most part. I’ll focus here on a couple of the negatives:

1)  The room was not made up very well after my first night. It felt very rushed, and there were some obvious faults, such as not clearing up a used coffee mug.

2) Wifi worked very well most of the time (and it was free). However, on one night it stopped working completely, which was quite frustrating. When calling the reception desk to complain, the call went unanswered.

3) There is a tray charge of €5 for anything ordered via room service. That’s fine when ordering breakfast, etc, but this was applied even when I ordered a single bottle of water, which ended up costing me €11. This seemed excessive, although I appreciate that there are other hotels that carry out similar practises.

The above are fairly minor issues in what was otherwise an excellent stay. The first two points might be attributed to the conference being held at the hotel, which had resulted in the hotel being absolutely packed with delegates. Still, I would have expected them to be prepared for this. I did get the impression that the hotel is commonly used for conferences and other big events (the Powerscourt House right next door is ideally suited for weddings, etc). If I was staying here on leisure, I would be wary about the possibility of large groups occupying parts of the hotel.",4,2013,09,27
217,What a fabulous treat !,"Had the most enjoyable stay here for my husbands 40 th with our 4 boys including 7 month old twins. The staff were do friendly and helpful attending to our every need. Room was  beautiful and as we were stating in a suite , we had plenty of space. Food in sugar loaf lounge was excellent and breakfast was a delight the following morning . A most enjoyable stay ! ",5,2013,09,27
217,Incredible hotel,"I recently stayed at this gorgeous hotel and was beyond impressed with the overall experience.  Ritz Carlton customer service at its finest!  From the parking attendants, reception staff to Trish (fantastic!) in Concierge, everyone was helpful, courteous and bent over backwards to make our stay spectacular.  We upgraded our room to a third floor suite- ample room for three women to move around, gather on the semi-private patio and yet allow for privacy.  High tech features while maintaining elegant atmosphere(touch pad controls for lighting, window treatments, heating and cooling and iPhone docking stations) while maintaining elegant atmosphere.  Courtesy use of bicycles around the area and quick rides into Enniskerry whenever we requested.  Dinned at Gordon Ramsay- chocolate sphere was to die for!  By far, the best hotel experience I have ever had!",5,2013,09,25
217,Most beautiful hotel!!!,"Our stay at the Ritz was phenomenal! The hotel is gorgeous and the staff will go above and beyond to make your stay 110%! The staff let us borrow bikes, printed out mapquest directions for us and were very friendly! We also loved the breakfast buffet, the spa & McGills Pub! This hotel is definitely worth the price. ",5,2013,09,25
217,Beautiful location and hotel,"Rumor has it the end of September the management is changing.  I wouldn't be deterred based on this single change.  The hotel is a beautiful property, the gardens are amazing, rooms and fully automated with touchscreen control of drapes, lighting, and HVAC.  The pool and steam room were clean and well kept.  Spa staff was almost overly attentive to us, but no complaints, they were always available when we needed assistance of had questions.  It's about a 30 minute drive into Dublin, so plan accordingly, but I wouldn't let that deter me from staying and this wonderful facility.",5,2013,09,24
217,Stunning Location and Hotel Facilities,"Spent three days as part of a conference group in this superb hotel with fantastic views of the Wicklow mountain's. Weather was by chance exceptional that September week end. Our room was enormous, very comfortable and had loads of luxurious mod cons. Hotels do not get much better than this. As for the golf courses, well these too were of a very high standard. Powerscourt House itself is a true Irish gem. The hotel is soon to change branding and we hope that this will in no way affect its very high standards.",5,2013,09,23
217,Unquestionable,What an absolute treat to be able to stay in a suite in this fabulous hotel! A superb location with wonderful views. Polite and courteous staff. Great facilities. I have only have praise for this hotel which is why there is no point in me writing anything further apart from 'I thoroughly recommend it'!,5,2013,09,22
217,Friendly staff lovely place,"My partner and I booked in for a spa day for our anniversary, we booked the couples suit as we thought it would be nice to have somewhere to relax together and have a couples massage. Upon arrival we were shown round the spa by a very friendly lady and while signing the forms we noticed that we had only booked in for a massage. We didnt mention it as the facilities were very good and thought as long as we had the massage together it would be fine. The pool was amazing and the lunch they serve is great value and presented very well and we were given a glass of champagne for our anniversary which I though was very nice of them. Unfortunately when we went for the massage we were taken separately.  We questioned this ans were told there must of been a mix up at reception but due to time constraints we couldn't have the couples massage which was pretty much the point in us choosing there. The massage was fine the therapist was very professional but we did leave feeling slightly disappointed especially after we were upsold the complete couples package in the first place. Overall it was a pleasant experience I just feel for a place of its stature it should be more organised and proactive with customer bookings.",4,2013,09,22
217,Ritz-Carlton Powerscourt...Amazing Experience!,"We just returned from a 1 week stay (Sept. 11-18, 2013) at this breathtaking hotel.  We were 3 couples (family) from USA (NY/NJ/VA). So impressed with suites and the outstanding service from the enitre staff.  Kudos to Stephen (bellman) and the concierge (Stephen & Trish) who answered our endless questions.  Memorable ""eats"" were:  Poppies in Enniskerry (breakfast); Jamie Fox's Pub in Glencullen (dinner), FX Buckley on Crow Street in Dublin, (dinner), Barracuda Restaurant on the water in Bray (dinner), Oar Restaurant in Howth (great fish chowder for lunch), Cafe LaCoco in Kilkenney (lunch), Powerscourt Arms (dinner) in Enniskerry, Cafe at Powerscourt (lunch).  All the restaurants took great pride in serving fresh food.  The Irish know how to bake bread and work their magic with soups!  When we needed a break, we enjoyed the amazing spa and pool at the Ritz Carlton.  Favorite tour was Waterford and enjoyed Malahide Castle (north of Dublin).  Navigating the local roads in our 6 passenger van was definitely a challenge.  Roads are very windy with unforgiving stone walls.  Our Garmin GPS did not work as it would not ""recalculate"".  Garmin GPS said ""off road"" while were were traveling on the M50 (a major highway!).  Our back-up plan (Smart phone with Google maps) did much better.  Dan Dooley Car Rentals at Dublin airport needs to speed up their check-in process.  We had to wait on line for 1 hour before hopping on the van to pick up our car!!!!  Thank you to all of the people in Ireland who are so welcoming and friendly!",5,2013,09,21
217,One of places to stay on your bucket list,"If quiet, privacy, breathing fresh air, pampering luxury, classy without arrogance ambiance, this is a place worth to splurge because you get more than what you paid for.   We stayed in a 731 sq.ft. suite room with Mountain View, both from bedroom & living room.  Gorgeous furniture and design, butter cream color tone, heavenly bed, digital screen controlling the lightings, room temp, and automatic open & close of the bedroom curtain.  From the day you book you got a personal email of confirmation & dinner time arrangement, on the day arrived we were welcome with friendly warm staff and Ritz gourmet box of chocolate with personalized Happy Anniversary greeting card. entering the suite, hallway with additional ""guest"" toilet, lighted bar shelving, then gorgeous living room with oak desk and heavenly King size bed with coat rack, sofa, carved table. Then you have another room with enclosed door, and his & hers closet on let and right to get thru the gorgeous bathroom. Full mirrored side of his & hers sink, big bath tub on the left side and on the right side divided into rain shower & toilet with potpourri to gently fragrant the room. The bathroom has a LED TV flat customised with the mirror!  Make time to enjoy the ESPA Spa pool facility, splendid.  Dinner either at Gordon Ramsey or Lounge, are both with Ramsey's recipe.  The plus of dining in Sugar Loaf Lounge is you get to watch the mountain, the fountain, till the day light turned dark. Before dinner they greet me with Happy Anniversary wish and with our coffee the manager sent us a tray of gourmet chocolate with Happy Anniversary written in ""chocolate"". Pls leave tips when you had dinner or left the room on your way out, as the staff serving you deserves it with no expectation. Book a suite here on your next trip and you will know how it feels to live like in a King's palace :)",5,2013,09,19
217,Beautiful surrounding and wonderful service,"This must be one of the most beautiful surroundings that I have stayed in a while. And the hotel is not bad either. If I can, I would like to return and have a longer stay. We had a room with a view  of the fountain, the garden and the Sugar Loaf Mountain as a backdrop. Food was good but not fantastic but the hotel had a shuttle service to go to the village of Enniskerry if guests want to dine there. 
A beautiful golf course is five minutes walk away and it made the folders in our group very happy. It is such an incredibly  beautiful property. ",4,2013,09,17
217,Unbelievable experience with Picturesque location and Luxury stay,"The Riz-Carlton Powerscourt is a beautiful property with absolutely beautiful surroundings.  We stayed here for a week in May in Mountain view suit.  Upon arrival visited the Powerscourt Gardens which were stunning.   Had buffet breakfast everyday and dinner in the evening.  Our last dinner was at Powerscourt Gardens which was an incredible experience in itself.  Overall graet food.  Visited the pool once, very nice pool, we could have just stayed at this place for pool only.  As most of the reviews describe the room marble bathroom with separate shower, soaking tub, toilet and his/her sinks, living room and fabulous bedroom. It was perfect. The lights, curtains and other room amenities are operated by a touch screen pad.   Yes we were fully pampered during our stay.  I wish I could come back.",5,2013,09,16
217,Good to above average,"We stayed for three nights at the hotel and were very pleased with the upgraded room we were given.  The hotel and the grounds are beautiful.  The food ranged from just average to pretty good.  We ate in every venue from the Sugarloaf Cafe (bland and uninspiring) to MaGill's Pub (great beer however food was very definitely over cooked) to Gordon Ramsay's (which was pretty good).

I found typical Ritz pricing when having cocktails before dinner.  Two mixed drinks should not cost $38 but expect to pay that if you order in the lounge.

The hotel seemed a bit spartan to us.  There was no gift shop (thank goodness because if 2 drinks cost $38 I can only image what the price points would have been in the gift shop)!

The staff at the hotel is excellent.  No detail goes unattended.  The concierge services were very good.

On October 1st the hotel will change to the Autograph Collection and will no longer be a Ritz-Carlton.  Along with that the Gordon Ramsay affiliation will disappear.  Various staff at the hotel feel that the rebranding will allow more independent management of the hotel.  Time will tell.",4,2013,09,16
217,Ritz Carlton Delivers Once Again...in Ireland,"My husband and I stayed one night at the Ritz Carlton during our two honey moon journey around Ireland. We did not make a reservation in advance and were pleasantly surprised to find availability on an early evening walk-in to the property. We were greeted in usual Ritz Carlton style upon our arrival by a charming young lady at the reception desk. She took great care of us and upon learning of our honey moon travels, provided an upgrade to a suite. Our room was stunning - separate dressing room with his/her closets, glistening marble bathroom with separate shower, soaking tub, toilet and his/her sinks, living room and fabulous bedroom. It was perfect. The lights, curtains and other room amenities are operated by a touch screen...which challenged me a few times...but it was a nice classy touch. We had dinner in the lounge area looking out at Sugarloaf Mountain. The food and service were average...I wish I could say more. For breakfast we ate in the dining area (included in room rate) and found the buffet to be excellent. The concierge assisted upon departure with some great tips on a route to our next destination (Wicklow Mountains). Overall it was a fabulous experience....great location if you visit Powerscourt before or after your stay. Most of the staff in the hotel that we met are international, so if you are looking for a true Irish experience at the Ritz....go downstairs to their pub. Thank you Ritz Carlton for continuing to set the bar on quality.",5,2013,09,15
217,Lovely luxury hotel in a beautiful estate,"This hotel is situation within the Powerscourt Estate with absolutely beautiful surroundings. Although a luxury hotel they do a lot to accommodate children. They have a special ""Kids' Check In"" at reception where they can feel like they are checking in to the hotel. They have a games room but this is only open during the day so if you are visiting places as a family and looking for something to keep the children occupied in the evening it is pointless. We didn't get to see this for this reason. Outside they have a giant chess set (although the pieces are solid wood so very heavy) and a small playground. The rooms very lovely and quite large so ideal for adding a cot or an extra bed. One feature they try is having a VoIP phone in the room which you can take with you around the hotel. The idea is wherever you are in the hotel, if someone calls your room you can take the call. In practise, these quickly run out of power and there is little or no signal in the public areas and nothing outside of the hotel so this is just a fancy gimmick. It is a shame as when travelling in a large family group it would have been very useful rather than using our mobiles. We have one member of the family who is gluten free and there are a few options for this during breakfast although sadly there were no GF sausages despite us mentioning this allergy when we booked. The staff are very friendly, helpful and always around to assist. Also, for a 5* hotel, they have free parking right by the front door and the option to valet park for just€20/day. We have already booked our next visit here although the hotel is being rebranded from Ritz-Carlton to another of the luxury Marriott brands from October 2013",5,2013,09,15
217,A very modern high tech Ritz Carlton,"The rooms were very comfortable with all modern amenities and very high tech equipment controls etc.

The hotel was very clean and well presented with very helpful staff who were very professional.

Unusual design hotel which grew on us.

Just outside Dublin if this is helpful.",5,2013,09,12
217,Excellent hotel and service but.......,"I had the pleasure of staying in the Ritz Carlton Powerscourt for a week during the summer, everything about the hotel was excellent except for one problem. I had my two boys with us (10 & 12) who wanted to use the swimming pool in the morning before going sight seeing and in the evening when we returned. Due to time restrictions, the pool was only available (at these times)  for people using the spa. As the spa is not owned by the Ritz, the management could not do anything to accommodate us although I must say they certainly did try.This was rather disappointing for the boys as this was the hottest summer in Ireland for about 20 years !
It wont spoil my enjoyment of the hotel or stop me from returning but I think they should change their advertising to say ""limited pool usage"" or some such wording, little things like this are important to families with kids (who are the future clients of Ritz Carlton hotels !).",5,2013,09,11
217,Luxury & relaxtion,"This really is an outstanding location. If you've got a few Euro to spare, book a suite on the top floor, with a view of the Sugar Loaf Mountain. The suites are five room heavens!

It is an expensive location, but well worth the treat. There are a few options for food at the hotel, there appears to be value if you book food with the room. We went on a Gordan Ramsey experience and had a delicious dinner in Ramsey's restaurant. With a well priced wine menu, which really surprised me.

The bar at the back of reception is expensive for food, but there is an irish themed pub (hold the paddywhackery comments!) downstairs which is not bad. The hotel is huge and very american. Think polished timer, deep carpets, white wall panels.

But it is in a beautiful location. Powerscourt House is just next door and there are shops and a garden centre there, a walk around the gardens is a must. 

There is also a very well equipped gym and a pool with sauna and jacuzzi. This is a lovely place to spend the morning, its quiet and relaxing and if you forget swimwear there are pretty well priced togs etc available.

We arrived on time for check-in but the room was not ready for almost one hour, which was a little annoying. There was NO apology for the delay and whilst waiting we have a 70 euro lunch! Welcome to the Ritz Carlton! That said the place is really nice and well recommended for a luxury break. 

Room service for breakfast was really good, hot food and a huge selection. Fill dining table etc setup in the sitting room by the staff.

Stayed here June 2012, despite review date below.",4,2013,09,11
217,Beautiful Hotel in County Wicklow,"The Riz-Carlton Powerscourt is a beautiful property that gets it right on every detail.  This property lives up to the five star, Ritz-Carlton model in every way.  Our room was amazing and huge, with a beautiful balcony.  As other reviewers have described, the rooms have touch-screen controls for temperature, lights, etc. and a marble bath with separate tub and (spacious) shower, as well as a television in the mirror.  We loved the on-site pub and enjoyed a few pints with the delightful bartenders there.  Dinner at the Gordon Ramsey restaurant was delicious, as was breakfast the next morning.  We did not have time to take advantage of the spa but enjoyed a tour of the beautiful facility and will certainly make time for it on our next visit.  

The staff at this hotel is excellent, maintaining an atmosphere of luxury and five star service, while also being warm, welcoming, and incredibly friendly.  Our only regret is that we did not have more time to spend here, as we were on a whirlwind tour of Ireland, but we will return when we can and would recommend this hotel to anyone.",5,2013,09,11
217,Absolutely loved the Ritz-Carlton Powerscourt!,"My wife and I stayed 4 days here on a business retreat. We absolutely loved everything about the Ritz-Carlton Powerscourt. Our room was very comfortable and led out to a patio area that surrounded us with the beauty of Ireland. The service was impeccable and the staff were so welcoming that it was like staying with family.

Touch screen control in the room made things a little more fun. Even turning off the lights was a joy to us. The TV in the bathroom mirror was a highlight as well. 

On the grounds of the Powerscourt Estate, there are so many beautiful gardens and fountains, and Powerscourt House itself, to explore. And even better than walking, you can let a golf buggy and drive along forested grounds of the estate. Its absolutely amazing.

While I did not take advantage of the spa, my wife did. She spent a half day being pampered and enjoyed every single moment.

The last thing I must mention is the breakfast each morning in Gordon Ramsey's Restaurant. A beautiful assortment of fresh fruits and locally made yogurt made my wife's day. The full Irish breakfast made mine! The food is amazing and the service just leaves you smiling.

I hope to plan a trip back to Ireland soon. And more specifically, The Ritz-Carlton Powerscourt.",5,2013,09,11
217,Beautiful hotel and location,"My wife, 19 year old daughter and I spent 4 nights here and thoroughly enjoyed our stay.  While the front of the hotel may be a bit gaudy for some, the rooms themselves (we had a suite facing the mountains) are beautiful and very spacious. Having a second half-bath is a really nice feature.  The location of the hotel in the Wicklow mountains is beautiful and yet you can be in downtown Dublin in 30 minutes (or shopping at Dundrum Town Center in 20 minutes). If you don't want to spend a lot for breakfast, you can walk over to the Avoca Cafe at the Powerscourt Estate next door and have a very nice inexpensive breakfast (or lunch).  My wife and daughter raved about the Spa.  The indoor pool, while in the basment, was nicely lit and a real oasis.  All the staff we interacted with were very helpful.  Would be thrilled to go back some day.",5,2013,09,10
217,Perfect,"Spent a lovely day and night here at the weekend. The hotel is lovely, in the most gorgeous peaceful surroundings. On arrival the staff were friendly and so welcoming and continued to be so for the whole stay. The room (Mountainview Room) was huge! It was more like a suite. We choose the Dine and Rewind package and had a beautiful dinner in the Sugar Loaf lounge. The spa is also fantastic - if a little pricey. All in all 5 star luxury at great value! If I had one tiny criticism it was that the room was a tad warm and no amount of tampering with the AC control made a difference.",5,2013,09,10
217,Disappointing Spa service,"Visited recently for a two day break. Hotel is beautifully located & the rooms are spacious and bright. The service front of house is superb. Visited the spa, after choosing a treatment from a very limited menu, treatment was fine, and I enjoyed an hour or so in the relaxation room. However on settling the treatment bill, I was fairly annoyed to be reminded twice about the gratuity line. This has never happened before in any spa/restaurant/hairdressers that I have ever visited & I felt it was wholly unprofessional.",4,2013,09,09
217,Beautiful Experience,"Spent one night at the Ritz Carlton for my 50th Birthday.  From the time we arrived in reception we were treated wonderfully. 

We were upgraded to a suite mountain view and it was breath taking.  

The only disappointment we had was the bar food.  Overall this is an amazing hotel and looking forward to returning.",5,2013,09,09
217,fantastic hotel,"Wow, we will be back.   Excellent service by staff members.  Food was amazing in Gordon Ramsey restaurant and served very well.   We were given free glass of champagne as it was a few days after my birthday.  Fabulous suite, beautifully decorated with massive bed and a bathroom to die for!   We took a bike ride on complementary bikes and visited the house and gardens.   Played golf on the west course - good greens but challenging.   Spent two nights at the end of a two week trip in Ireland so we mainly relaxed and enjoyed the room and views.   Highly recommend",5,2013,09,07
217,Hanging on by a Thread,"We visited the Ritz Spa for the ""City Escape"" package which includes 3 treatments and lunch. Treatments lasted a total of 1.5 hours. Both my friend and I were happy with the treatments. The serenity/relaxation room is nice however there is a very limited selection of just one type of tea (peppermint on the day) and ice water. Whole fruit is also available and also some dry nuts and fruit.  This was our second visit to the Ritz Spa and we did notice some deterioration in the standard in the year or so since our first visit. We were actually shocked at the state of the bathrobes provided to us, they were in tatters. Yellowed, torn, frayed at the edges and even had holes in them. I don't know how the spa manager can think they are acceptable for ""5 star"" they were far from it. Towels have also been downgraded and the showers were mere dribbles of water. Previously soft blankets were used in the treatment rooms but now in place of the nice blankets are the good towels missing from the changing rooms. The light lunch that came with the package was adequate, it could best be described as First Class aeroplane food except the drinks are not included as they would be on an aeroplane. It is presented as a ""bento box"" of small dishes. Overall we had an enjoyable half day and we will probably return - but if we see those bathrobes next time we will be walking out as they will 
be nothing but bare thread by that stage.",3,2013,09,06
217,Lovely spa day,"Myself & my sister went to the ritz spa for a day of pampering - we both had a lovely time relaxing in our robes for the day having had a massage & a facial, lunch & full use of the fascilities - pool, steam room etc we retired to the quiet room to read - bliss -the only thing i'd quibble about is neither of us got a full 2 hours of treatments.- more like 1 1\2 hours",4,2013,09,03
217,Amazing!,"My girlfriend and I Stayed at this hotel back in March for St. Patrick's week. It is conveniently located in County Wicklow about 20-30 minutes South of Dublin. Although it is a convenient train ride or drive into Dublin it is far from being in the city where there are a lot of people and a lot of traffic. The Hotel is on the Powerscourt estate and has a private road to beautiful scenic trails, lakes, horses etc. It shares the estate with the Powerscourt Mansion and gardens which is a nice place to spend a relaxing afternoon. Wicklow County is amazing. You can drive along the Braveheart and the Excaliber trails and see why over 70 movies have been shot in County Wicklow. There are amazingly different landscapes around every corner. The room was beyond what I was expecting for Europe. It had a huge bathroom, a living room and a separate bedroom and dressing room. It had state of the art electronics which you could control everything from the blinds and room temperature to the do not disturb indicator right from your bed. The restaurants were all good. The hotel staff was great. They will shuttle you down to town to the restaurants or pubs in a range rover then pick you up with a simple phone call. This hotel was amazing.",5,2013,09,03
217,Powerful Times at Powerscourt!,"Due to a bad experience with a vacation rental in County Westmeath, we were forced to find somewhere to stay for a few days at a moment's notice...during a weekend when there was lots going on around the Dublin area and most places were booked solid. Our party was large, we needed eight rooms, and space was short almost everywhere. Ritz-Carlton at Powerscourt to the rescue! We were able to book for Saturday, Sunday, and Monday nights (Aug. 10-12, 2013).

The place is spectacular! Exquisite grounds, gorgeous buildings, and great customer service. The Spa and Pool are grand, with times designated for family time and for adults only. I enjoyed a lovely massage and a facial during my time there. No hard sell on product, and a lovely serenity area with some special amenities.

Although we were not able to avail ourselves of the Gordon Ramsay restaurant there, we did enjoy many ""pub"" meals and a great game of Jenga at McGill's Pub onsite. Included breakfast (with our rate) was lovely, well presented, and generous. Loads of buffet items, and cooked to order, too. A few lunches in the Sugar Loaf Lounge were a delight also. 

The rooms were well stocked, huge, and spotlessly clean. Beds were very comfortable. Views were astonishing!

The small town of Enniskerry is adorable, and we had a wonderful dinner at the Italian restaurant there. We used the laundry to have clean clothes for our onward journey, and really enjoyed an area of Ireland that we had not intended to visit on this trip.",5,2013,09,03
217,Beautiful Hotel But Poorly Managed Dining Services,"We recently spent three nights there. The hotel and grounds were gorgeous - do not miss the walk through the Powerscourt Gardens.

The staff was pleasant and helpful. The rooms were more than spacious, extremely well furnished and very clean.

It is close to the charming village of Enniskerry and the hotel is happy to transport you to the village and the restaurants there will call the hotel to pick you up. Overall, it is best to have a car if you want to sightsee although there is a direct bus (44) from Enniskerry to Dublin - it takes about 1 hour and 15 minutes. It leaves from the village center but the departure point in Dublin is a little hard to find but the locals and bus drivers are very good about helping you find it. 

My only criticism is the food service. The morning breakfast is good but nothing special. The pub was fun and the food fine. The other two restaurants were underwhelming - food was only fair and service was atrocious especially for what one would expect in a Ritz Carlton. One issue is the hotel works hard at scheduling outside events (weddings and meetings) which would be fine except they are short staffed and poorly organized causing a spillover effect to guests staying at the hotel. My advice - try the pub if you need a quick bite to eat in the evening (check to see it is open since they closed it one night until 9:00 for a private function) - otherwise go into the village.

It will be changing from Ritz Carlton to another brand Oct. 1 - supposedly still a comparable luxury brand so it will be interesting to see what effects this will have.",4,2013,09,03
217,"Tranquil and stunning location, amazing and impressive hotel!",Stayed here for two nights and it was very relaxing and enjoyable! Room was very spacious and the bed was so big and comfortable! Breakfast was very substantial and endless! Staff were so helpful! McGills bar was very busy and maybe a little slow to serve but it was busy so it was acceptable! Food was a little disappointing and maybe I was expecting too much but I didn't feel the wow factor! My husband and I took advantage of our time alone and enjoyed the Games Room and had a ping-pong match which my husband won!! The girl in the games room was very friendly and it had great facilities for children both indoor and outdoor too! We didn't use the pool or spa facilities as we had a busy schedule so I cannot rate these! Gym looked impressive and very well equipped! Grounds were immaculate! ,4,2013,09,02
217,Ireland's Countryside at it's best!,"My husband and I enjoyed our stay at this hotel ! The staff at the check-in desk, the concierge, the bellman, the maids, all staff members were friendly and helpful. Our suite was enormous and beautifully decorated. I wish our bathroom at home was as lovely as the one in our suite! We had a balcony with furniture. I only wish we had a view of Sugar Loaf Mountain ! We used the pool and hot tub. We had breakfast in the Gordon Ramsey restaurant every morning. The food was amazing. We ate at McGill's pub and Gordon Ramsey's for dinner. Both were great. The king sized bed was very comfortable and the hotel is very quiet. Great for sleeping! We also played golf on one of the beautiful golf courses. Fantastic views. While staying at the hotel we toured Powerscourt House and Gardens, and saw Killruddery House. Must sees! We took a trip to Glendalough and hiked some of the beautiful trails. This was a great four days. It took less than an hour to drive to the hotel from Dublin Airport. It was well worth it!",5,2013,09,01
217,Misses a heartbeat every now and then,"Perhaps because one expected a very high level of service and amenities of the Ritz Carlton, one came away after a 3 days stay at one of the top suites overlooking the Sugar loaf mountain, a little disappointed. We were later to learn that the Hotel had changed ownership and was soon to become a Autograph collection Hotel of the Marriott. Perhaps this explained some of the glitches.
The Hotel is located in the very picturesque surroundings of the Powerscourt Estate, which has a stunning garden, just a short walk from the Resort. The rooms are large but very odd dimensions - very deep and dark in the interior - and for a fairly new hotel the design is dated. Rooms and bathrooms are otherwise very well equipped, with nice views out in to the garden and forest beyond.
Staff was very friendly, both at the reception desk, concierge very knowledgeable and happy to provide advice, the lounge bar a great place to sit and have tea or a drink with excellent service. Breakfast is excellent - try and grab a table near the window.
The only area where service was found wanting was in the Housekeeping department - the coffee machine hadn't been cleaned for ages, milk etc was not replenished.
Finally, the Gordon Ramsey restaurant - over rated, and particularly for my wife who was vegetarian, with extremely limited choice.",4,2013,08,30
217,An Irish Countryside Paradise,"This hotel is absolutely stunning. Due to my hotel status we were upgraded to a suite on an upper floor overlooking the Wicklow Mountains. It was an amazing room - large bathroom, ultra comfortable bed, embarrassingly large closet area (which my wife loved), and a balcony with a breathtaking view.

In terms of meals, the Gordon Ramsey restaurant was worth the price. They had one of the best meals I had on the trip - the pork shoulder. We were celebrating a special occasion and they were nice enough to acknowledge it with a special dessert. The service at McGills pub was everything you could ask for. Friendly, knowledgeable staff and a great, easygoing atmosphere. 

My wife loves spa treatments, particularly ESPA, and ranks the one she got at this spa as one of the best. The facilities were relaxing and spacious. We are not usually fans of indoor pools but the one here and the jacuzzi area was enjoyable, unique, with a temperature that was just right. 

The one letdown of our stay was the service at the Sugar Loaf Lounge. We ate there just as we were departing and it left a bad taste in our mouth. The service was not just bad; it was almost nonexistent. We noticed that other diners who were sat well after us got their food before we even got our starters. And even when we asked about the status of our food, the response was both rude and the service remained poor throughout the meal. 

Having said that, the hotel is fantastic. Everything is as beautiful as the pictures online show, if not more so. Hotel staff was welcoming. Worth it if you can do it. We have told our friends this is one of the biggest highlights from our trip.",5,2013,08,29
217,This is truly and amazing hotel!,We loved everything about this hotel...from the excellent check-in services to the friendly bellman..the magnificent room overlooking Sugar Loaf Mountain...the water in the room...the amazing bathroom/bedroom/sitting room.  The swimming pool is like a spa in itself...it is quiet and dark and I fell asleep in the lounge chair.  The exercise room was spotless.  The Gordon Ramsay Restaurant was a disappointment.  The prices were in line with everywhere else but the portions were tiny!  We would definitely go back and stay for a few days if we ever get to Ireland again.,5,2013,08,29
217,Ritz Carlton Ireland,"This is a lovely spot, don't even consider staying in Dublin when this place is so close. Price was reasonable we thought given this is a Ritz. Service was excellent and staff was very friendly. Enjoyed playing chess (although missing a few pieces in large set on grounds) and croquet on back lawn and loved the pool for a little vaca break for the kids - staff again very friendly here although hours for kids limited, understandable given that this is an upscale resort. Bikes were actually REALLY bad but maybe difficult to replace as not as commercial as the states here? Pub dinner was very good although every meal in Europe took a long time compared to what we are used to in the states so have realistic time expectations. Definitely eat here instead of going into town as food is much better than what we found there for lunch next day. Only reason did not give it a perfect review is that our rollaway for our 3rd child was given away. We had booked connecting rooms with a rollaway (kids are difficult sleepers so really important for everyone to have own bed to be happy) and this was in reservation and confirmed upon checkin. However at dinnertime still no rollaway, they said they were working on. Then at 9pm when we went came to go to bed still no rollaway only to find out that they were all given away and none left. Obviously a mistake by someone that was rectified by them bringing in an extra king mattress to put on the floor. Even offered to upgrade to Presidential Suite but that would have left us with 1 bed for 5 people! In the end, not a huge deal but annoyed that although apologetic for mixup this should have been taken care of much earlier than 10pm at night with 3 tired kids. Generally we expect a better attention to detail and standard of care at a Ritz Carlton.",4,2013,08,28
217,Amazing hotel in a beautiful location,"We stayed for just one night but I will definitely be back for more. For service, cleanliness, friendliness, and absolute luxury it is unrivalled. The setting of this hotel and the grounds are amazing, certainly the best maintained grounds I have ever seen and the views from our room were spectacular. The room itself was really beautiful and luxurious. The swimming pool at this hotel really is spectular it's dark and sultry and glittery and feels like you're swimming beneath the stars. They have really achieved an amazing ambience here. This is the most beautiful hotel I have ever visited and cannot wait to go there again. Unfortunately there was one down side, the hot breakfast in particular the sausages were terribly undercooked and not at all appealing but a  good variety of other food available. ",5,2013,08,26
217,Disappointing - definitely not value for money,"The title of this might be a little harsh. Don't get me wrong the hotel is a fine hotel but I didn't get the five star feel from it. Stayed for one night in mountain view suite - room lovely ,dinner in Gordon Ramsey restaurant fantastic. Our waiter was lovely and very attentive. Food was delicious but to be expected at these prices!! Breakfast disappointing for a five star - buffet style with not a lot of choice. Spa slightly disappointing. The hotel is way overpriced and if rates were reduced this could have been a completely different review ",3,2013,08,25
217,Disappointing,Over priced. Fantastic location but the building  does not fit into its surroundings. Staff helpful but I have experienced better service. I can't put my finger on it but the service just not genuine. Have stayed in many 5 star hotels but despite the surroundings this did not feel  five star. Also are in the Gordon resturant and  thought the food was very good was also disappointed by the experience,4,2013,08,24
217,Disappointing trip,"Lovely room but couldn't sleep due to excess noise from pub which room overlooked.
Very disappointing and tiring experience especially as we had booked our room well in advance and we had anticipated a more relaxing stay in what we thought was a high quality hotel.
The pub outdoor area should be well away from guest accomodation.",2,2013,08,23
217,Whoever said money can't buy happiness never stay at The Ritz at Powerscourt,"This was my third trip to Ireland.  I never, ever miss staying at The Ritz Carlton at Powerscourt. 
The hotel is gorgeous as are the grounds that surround them.  The rooms are the soul of luxury.  The bathrooms alone are a religious experience with their heated marble floors and deep bathtubs.  Did my girlfriend and I lay on the warm floor and watch the TV set into the mirror?  You bet.  Why? Because we could! The beds are heavenly, hello goosedown, how do I love thee?  What I find truly exceptional about this place is the homey feeling you get from all the staff.  You're welcomed like a friend that's just come home after a long journey.  To say the service is good is insulting.  Every little request is handled with a genuine smile and a bounce in the step.  The staff that pops by in the late afternoon to turn down your bed and offer bottled water are just so happy and pleasant.  I so appreciated the fellow that drove me into town in the black Range Rover and then picked me up when I was done shopping.  I budget my Irish vacations making sure I have a few days here.  Oh, and the pool and steamroom are beautiful and serene in an otherworldly way.  Be sure when you book to add the breakfast daily or you'll be sorry, trust me.   The Powerscourt estate gardens aren't to be missed and boasts some of the best shopping in Ireland.  Enjoy being spoiled, you'll love it.",5,2013,08,23
217,Beautiful Hotel and Grounds!!,"This is a hotel that makes me want to fly back to Ireland just to stay there. The rooms are fantastic--spacious, luxurious, well-appointed. It was like a small apartment instead of the average hotel. The service was wonderful, the breakfast great, the lobby beautiful. But the really special part is the garden on the hotel property--unbelievable! I loved every moment of my visit there! If you stay at the Powerscourt--DO NOT MISS THE GARDENS! Also, the area was nice--not too far from Dublin but in the country. We took nice drives as well as spending time (via taking the train) in  Dublin!",5,2013,08,20
217,Highly Recommended,"Had a fabulous ""impromptu"" stay here as we just called in to have a drink, and ended up staying.

We had a fabulous suite, ( good value as it was very last minute) with nice views. Staff all very helpful and friendly.  Unfortunately, due to time constraints we did not dine here but will do on our next stay as we intend to return  and stay longer, taking time to enjoy the grounds/river walk etc etc.

I believe that the bar is quite lively on Friday/Saturday nights again unfortunately we did not get to experience this.",5,2013,08,19
217,"Again, FABULOUS!  Highly recommend-perfect--","almost.  We love this hotel-the staff go out of their way to make your stay enjoyable.  Beautiful rooms and grounds--bikes are in great condition and ready for you to check out with the extremely helpful staff.  Breakfasts are gorgeous--a buffet that is a feast for the eye.  Service is excellent EVEN when busy.  Only glitch this visit was the problem with 4 children (ages from 6 to 10) who were permitted by their 2 dads who were sitting in the more casual of the dining rooms, to run around the entire area in bare feet, bathing suits, yelling, bumping into customers, chairs, and the 2 fathers were absolutely ignoring this incredible behavior.  After over 35 minutes of mayhem, I finally asked our server if it would be possible to have the children STOP running around and yelling--he said he wished he could but policy won't let him tell them to stop but he was permitted to tell the fathers that they needed to leave as the table was booked for another reservation.  I love children--but in a restaurant parents need to have their progeny respect others.  Shame on the parents!
Rooms facing the mountain are glorious--beautifully maintained.  We will certainly return!",5,2013,08,16
217,Excellent hotel,"Really excellent hotel where staff could not do enough.  Hotel is purpose built with large rooms and luxurious surroundings.  Spa is excellent especially the pool which is unusually black marble but lit by crystals!  Hotel is situated near Enniskerry, perfect for Wicklow mountains and also day trips into Dublin.",5,2013,08,16
217,"Great Spa, but hotel disappointing","The spa was excellent, great pool and sauna and lovely staff. The hotel itself was disappointing, room wasn't ready when we arrived, so we were sent to have coffee (which we had to haggle at check out not to pay for!). Room still not ready, so we went to the spa... Having said that the beds were extremely comfortable and the room very quiet - we had the best nights sleep on the whole trip.",3,2013,08,16
217,Shine Fading fast from the Ritz!!!,"2nd time staying and I must say that while there are many many great aspects to this hotel (gardens, room size and fit-out, pool area etc ) there are some basic let-downs which take from what should be a spectular five-star experience. 

Pros:
- front-door staff are absolutely fantastic with permanent smiles, help with luggage, lift to town in   shuttle, bicycles etc etc etc

- beautiful spacious rooms with great amenities

- fabulaous lobby with magical furniture, chandeliers and beautiful carpets. rugs and panelling

- nice pool area with great steam room and changing rooms

- superb parkland setting with magnificent views of the Sugarloaf mountain

Cons:

-  no evidence of a ""manager"" on duty and as a result staff are a little laid back

- waited 1 hr and 10 mins for food in the Sugar Loaf on one evning and the ""excuse"" was.... "" we are very busy with big groups and our kitchen is too small !!!!!!

- a large dog was allowed sit at a table in the restaurant at dinner time, unchallenged by any staff member from the door in and this wasnta guide-dog or assistance dog!!! Incredible....

I've had better experiences in some B&Bs around the world and I hope that the new owners / Brand will not be as sloppy....",3,2013,08,16
217,Unbelievable place in middle of nowhere,"When you travel in Ireland and you want to spend a day or more in luxury - this is it! The building is stunning, and has unbelievable space. Some of the rooms are small apartments - try to get one of these, they are still affordable. The area around is beautiful. Service - front desk, rooms, restaurants - is absolutely 5 star. This is really a small paradise on earth, just a bit difficult to find.",5,2013,08,16
217,Best hotel on my entire Ireland vacation,"Stayed at the Ritz Powerscourt and as always the Ritz exceed my expectations. I was greeted upon arrival at the front desk and offered assistance with our luggage upon arrival.  Bellman thoroughly explained all the amenities in the hotel and the room and how to work all lighting, TV's and control panels.  Rooms are very spacious, contemporary yet classic. Beds are heavenly and the bathrooms are amazing.  

Had dinner in the pub the first night which was packed.  Service was a bit slow due to the amount of business.  However, our server did let us know the food service would be longer then usual prior to ordering.  This was greatly appreciated so we could anticipate the extended time instead of being upset about it.  Kudos to the bar team for being on top of it!  Ian in the bar was exceptional and very friendly.  We went back to the pub the following day and he even remembered us and help explain the game of curling to us.

Staff at the front desk is friendly and all requests were taken care of and with a smile.  We never heard the word no.  We presented a question to the front desk for an in room freezer, and although one was not available a solution was still provided to us.  

The grounds are amazing and well manicured. Not to mention the walkable distance to Powerscout Garden and the well manicured walking path up to resort is stunning and an added bonus. I also appreciated the complimentary ride into town, what a great amenity.

I work in management for a top resort and Ritz Carlton Powerscourt is a true example of refined hospitality and management should be proud of the staff.  I will be sure to be back and share my experience with all travelers I know headed to Enniskerry.",5,2013,08,14
217,I'd go back for the pool,"We stayed one night at this very comfortable hotel last autumn. My husband was attending a conference and I tagged along for a little rest and relaxation. 
We arrived early in the morning and as expected our rooms were not available for check-in yet (which is understandable). I decided to go for a walk aound the Powerscourt grounds outside the hotel and also into Enniskerry village. The journey back from the village is quite steep and can be achieved in heels but I would not recommend it.
By the time I returned to the hotel I was delighted to hear that our room was ready. It was very spacious and welcoming. However I was disappointed because the view was of the front of the hotel which consists of a parking lot.
I made my way to the gym and was impressed with the equipment and facilities available to guests. The room was well ventilated and overlooked the mountains. The pool at the hotel was the best I've ever experienced - it was so serene I wished I could've spent more time there.
The Sugar Loaf Lounge is a lovely spot for lunch. I was greeted warmly by staff and they immediately accommodated my request for a quiet spot. We had breakfast there the following morning because the Gordan Ramsay restaurant was packed. I was very glad of this because there was a very strong cooking/ food smell wafting through the restaurant that morning.  Also the furniture at the lounge was more comfortable and the view added to the enjoyment of our breakfast. 
Since I only made dinner reservations the day I checked in I was only able to get a table at the Gordon Ramsay restaurant for 9pm that night. I liked that they were willing to accommodate Muslim guests (that was a nice touch) but not at a day's notice. The staff were more than helpful in going through the menu with a fine toothcomb. They even managed to provide dessert that wasn't even on the menu!
McGills proved to be a good spot to watch a match and cure a hangover. The food there is good but they may benefit from an extra staff that day. Don't let the decor fool you that you are in a local Irish pub. If that happens the bill will bring you back to reality.",4,2013,08,14
217,Wedding Anniversary Weekend,"Tye wife and I stayed here for 2 nights for our wedding anniversary. What a fantastic hotel this place is. We we're upgraded on arrival. 

The room was sensational, very large, with walk in wardrobe, nice size bathroom and huge bed. 

The staff are all very nice as you would expect. We ate and had a few drinks in the bar the 1st night. The food was very good as were the drinks. The 2nd night we ate at Gordon Ramsay's restaurant and the food was of a high quality and not over the too price wise. 

The pool and leisure centre are also very nice. 

The only slight disappointment was the breakfast which was €28 per person. Which I would expect would be of a very high quality. The rashers and sausages could have been better. 

All in all a great hotel and would love to go back. ",5,2013,08,14
217,A perfect stay,"What an awesome hotel. Wonderful service, location, rooms, grounds and more. We just wished we had more than 1 night there! Great for golfers too, with 2 courses in walking distance. And the Ramsey restaurant is exemplary too. Not to be missed. ",5,2013,08,12
217,"Beautiful hotel, very scenic and comfortable","We began our Irish vacation at the Ritz Powerscourt and it was beautiful. I'd expect nothing less from the Ritz Carlton... Beautiful hotel, amazing views of the Wicklow Mountains, first class all the way. We walked into town a couple times and really enjoyed it, as well as the Powerscourt Gardens next door, which were stunningly beautiful. Great hotel, very nice stay!",5,2013,08,11
217,Fantastic!,My partner and I stayed here on the August bank holiday and had an amazing time. We had a classic suite and it was gorgeous. We had no plans but to relax and everyone really made are stay just that. From checking in until we left (we were obliged with a late check out...) we had smiles on our faces. One word GO!,5,2013,08,10
217,A very pleasant surprise.,"Touring Ireland, making our own decisions where to stay.. Checked out a map and did all the planing ourselves for the first time. Ashford Castle first, onto Dromoland Castle, Killarney Park next. A misstep in Kinsale and then onto Wicklow. When we walked into the Ritz I felt I had arrived at a terribly posh location. The lobby is beautiful. Jake was at the reception desk and was wonderful to us. He personally collected our baggage from our car and made sure it was delivered right away to our room. We were so nervous after staying in Kinsale. We were shown into the room and my husband took a deep breath as did I. I was hoping his feeling was the same as mine. I could have jumped up and down with joy. We both loved the room..it looked like a French design, all white walls and molding with blue and white stripe wall paper inside the moldings. It was so beautifully decorated neither one of us wanted to leave the room.. We were shown how to operate the panel on each side of the bed. Touch it and it opens and closes the drapes, changes the temperature in the room, turn the lights on and off, let housekeeping know whether or not to come in, we'll you get the idea. 
       We had dinner in the Gordan Ramsey Restaurant, first class all the way, next day we played golf right across the way at 
Powerscourt Country Club, rented clubs and cart and had a wonderful day. We choose to eat in the pub in the hotel that night and it was fantastic. Real pub food in a hotel. A real treat. I would recommend this hotel to anyone. Oh, I forget to mention the bathroom, it was beautiful, outstanding, just like our own spa.  This is also a Marriott. Again I say "" nothing like a Marriott"".",5,2013,08,09
217,Poorly Managed,"We spent a couple of days at this property; the location is very nice and the botanical garden next door really amazing. The Gourmet Restaurant is closed on Monday, the shower in the SPA was “out of order”, the Jacuzzi was “closed due to maintenance”... well, just not what you expect. Furthermore, the hotel has a serious problem in the Housekeeping department. Finally, and this is a very personal opinion, the architecture of the building looks like having been designed by Arch. Albert Speer.",2,2013,08,07
217,Relax in Luxury,"This is a 5 star hotel that lives up to its name.We had a Classic Suite with a balcony which was very comfortable and spacious with views over the fountain.
The staff were very attentive and the food in all areas is very good but the Gordan Ramsey Restaurant was amazing.The range of Breakfasts were great.The pool Spa and fitness suite were everything you would expect from a 5 star.We travel with our little Westie who loved the gardens and walks.The setting of the Hotel at the foot of the Wicklow hills overlooked by Sugar Loaf Mountain is beautiful.Treat yourself to a few days here you wont regret it.",5,2013,08,07
217,Unbelieveable Experience!,"There are not enough stars (circles?) to describe the experience at this hotel.  From the full Irish breakfast, to the Gordon Ramsey restaurant where our waitress took us on an exclusive tour of the kitchen (you can reserve a table there to watch the preparation of your food), to the exercise room with the best workout machines I have ever experienced, the most fabulous pool in the spa that I did not have an opportunity to use (drat the luck!), the TV in the bathroom mirror, this place is Nirvana, or as close I will probably be before I die.  All of the staff, I observed, are totally decicated to giving you a first-class experience.  Everyone should be so furtunate as to stay here once in their lives.",5,2013,08,06
217,Depends on the price,"Stayed here recently and must say most of the reviews are true. The hotel staff go out of their way to be helpful and polite. The rooms are large and comfy with all mod cons available (tv a little dated judging by the sound quality). I do feel that the comment on the bathrooms towels below is a little over the top, they could trip you up they are so large and there is no shortage of them. 
Food is fine but unless you eat in Ramseys the choice is the same throughout the hotel, breakfast at 28e is a bit much unless the company is paying or your on a package.
Would I visit again? yes",4,2013,08,05
217,Enjoy Every Moment of this Beautiful Place!,"We recently stayed at the Ritz Powerscourt and had a lovely visit. Our 3rd floor room had a spectacular balcony with a view of the mountain, lawns and fountain. It had a patio table for four and two chaise lounges for our enjoyment. The weather was cooperative so we took full advantage of this private area to gather as a family.

The room was large and beautiful with a well appointed bathroom a rain head shower and a deep tub. We had no problem with the size of our towels (they were full size bath sheets) and there were plenty to go around. The spa robes hanging in our bathroom were lush and comfortable. There was a dressing room with more closet space than a traveling person could possibly use unless they were staying for a month. 

 I especially loved opening my nightstand drawer and pushing a button to open the curtains in the morning. We would leave for breakfast each morning and push the button that looked like a vacuum cleaner. When we returned from breakfast, our room was clean. I'd like one of these buttons in my home here in the States please.

We loved the breakfast buffet in the Gordon Ramsey restaurant. The food was beautifully presented, fresh and delicious.  This became our meeting place every morning where we sat outside for breakfast overlooking the grounds and the fountain. 

We had great fun in McGills pub and enjoyed the staff. Especially Johnny and Ian who were full of information about the surrounding area. I was able to fly fish one morning which was all arranged for me by the 3D Concierge staff. Perfect! The 3D Concierge also hired a car and driver for us so that we could hike the Cliffs of Moher. We had a spectacular day and I would highly recommend this activity.

After our hike, I had the most relaxing manicure and pedicure at the spa! I enjoyed my comfortable surroundings and my manicurist did a wonderful job. I'm now perfectly manicured!

Laura at the front desk was especially helpful with every little thing we needed. She was always pleasant and cheerful and was a pleasure to work with. Even though we had our own car, we often took advantage of the free shuttle service into Enniskerry provided by the Ritz. Really convenient for those of us who enjoy a glass of wine or two with dinner.

I would highly recommend the Ritz Powerscourt to anyone traveling in the Dublin area. The moment you walk in the lobby, you realize you are in a very special place.",5,2013,08,04
217,Very Disappointed - Comprehensive Review,"First Impression:  The pictures of the façade of the hotel on the Ritz Carlton website are 100% accurate, however, that particular view is actually the rear of the hotel facing the mountains.  The front entrance to the hotel looks like you are driving up to the back entrance of any standard hotel – very unimpressive.  In fact, if you do not go outside the rear of the hotel (which I had no reason to do), the only way to see the white façade is if you look out your window (if you have a rear facing room).  Moreover, the beautiful gardens that you see in the picture are actually part of the Powerscourt Estate Gardens (which you must pay for in order to gain access to).

The hotel lobby is striking, the front desk was very professional and my wife and I were upgraded to a junior suite.  Our room was very spacious and beautiful.  My two complaints about the room: small bath towels (this is Ritz Carlton – towels should be lush) and the bathroom toilet room had a see-thru door – how about some privacy?

Missing: This hotel did not have any retail shops and the business center was located very far from the main lobby (and the computers were not working properly).

Food:  Expensive, but delicious – no issues.  However, one night my wife and I wanted to have dessert at Gordon Ramsey.  It was 9:30 pm and the restaurant had five empty tables.  The hostess (Aiste) refused to seat us because we didn’t have a reservation.  After rolling our eyes at her and reminding her that the restaurant was closing soon, she finally relented and gave us a table.  When we left the restaurant – 30 minutes later – those five tables were still empty.  As a guest of the hotel, this was unacceptable. (Late night in-room dining is a joke – don’t bother.)

Spa:  Great treatments – lousy locker rooms.  We have gone to spas all over the world and were very surprised that the locker room lacked an attendant, deodorant, styling gel, brush, shaving cream, etc.  They had no toiletries whatsoever and the towels were also on the smaller side (very odd for such a high-end hotel).  Lastly, another pet peeve is the short-changing you get on spa treatments.  If I pay for an 80-minute massage, don’t come to the waiting room 2 minutes late, slowly walk me to the treatment room, have me get under the covers (wait 2 minutes to return to the room) and then end the treatment 3 minutes early to fetch a cup of water.  I actually timed my treatment one day and my 80 minutes was actually 68 minutes of a real massage.

Fitness Center:  Fantastic – very impressive

Golf:  Beautiful and breathtaking 

Concierge:  Biggest disappointment.  They have this new concept of a 3D Concierge (not sure what they intended by this).  She was inconsistently available (in what used to be a store) and was very unknowledgeable.  For example, we wanted to go into Dublin.  She suggested we take a taxi to the train station and catch a train to “Dublin” and enjoy the view from the train of the Irish Sea.  However, there is no train station called “Dublin.”  Had I not asked someone where the stop for Dublin was, I would have been on the train until we got to the end.  She should have told us the name of the stop.  Also, we went to a show and knew we would be leaving Dublin late.  We wanted to know about getting a taxi back from Dublin.  She told us to walk over to the Marriott (which the Ritz is part of) and that the concierge there would put us in a cab that has a special flat rate to bring us back to the Ritz.  Problem: there was no Marriott hotel.  The hotel was called the Shelbourne.  It’s a Renaissance hotel, which is under the Marriott umbrella - but it wasn’t called the Marriott.  We were sent on a wild goose chase and thankfully, a police officer Googled it for us and we found the hotel.  The concierge at the Shelbourne had no idea about a special flat rate, but was kind enough to get us a taxi.

Hotel Employee Standouts:  Laura (Front Desk), David (Front Desk – Manager) and Andres (Maitre Des in the main lobby restaurant) and Thomas (Spa desk attendant).  Went above and beyond their job descriptions.

Now it might sound to you like I am being hard on this hotel – I assure you that I have looked forward to this trip for long time.  I was very disappointed, my review is 100% accurate with no spin and would not recommend this hotel at all.  And btw, rumor has it that this hotel is not going to be under the Ritz category for much longer.",3,2013,08,02
217,Ritz and Ireland!,"What an awesome property and hotel!  Had a King Suite overlooking the garden that could've been a condo with kitchen area with oven and fridge.  As I love to cook, I couldn't resist getting fresh pasta, sauce, and a loaf of bread from a shop at the Powerscourt House next door.  We ate on our lovely patio.  Great walks each day.  The waterfall was a drive and nice scene but overpriced unless you plan a picnic.  The hotel food was great too.  Very glad we didn't opt for our first trip to be in downtown Dublin even though the car was expensive and driving stressful.  Great vacation.  Thank you Ritz!",5,2013,08,01
217,Excellent,"Excellent hotel with great service and standards. The only negative in my view is that the food in the foyer restaurant is over priced, for a simple snack or light lunch I would recommend the bar food. Also I need to mention a staff member from the breakfast staff, Alberto, I was pleasantly shocked that he remembered me from my last visit which was four months previous. Staff like him make a hotel into a 5 star and make one feel like a valued guest.",5,2013,07,31
217,beautiful hotel,"This was our 4th stay in this hotel. staff  efficient friendly and courteous . Stayed in a beautiful Suite  good food served in lobby.There are parts of the hotel that are in need  of renovation such as stairs carpet and perhaps  a lick of paint here and there but these where very minor.Also would one other small quibble ,i am not a fan of buffets  as i find that the rashers and sausages are generally undercooked or cold.",5,2013,07,30
217,What an exceptional experience,"Well where do I start,

Myself and my new life decided after the stress of organising a wedding from overseas and a christening of our 1st born all in one weekend we needed a relaxing break!!! And oh boy did we get it. We purchased the couples retreat package at €650 for two nights. This included two full body massages bought days. i had what is amply named the stress buster , and it was amazing. The 1st night was a meal in Mc Gills pub which was top notch even by Ireland high standards of ""pub grub"" the 2nd at Gordon Ramseys restaurant which was only gorgeous , and contrary to pre conceptions the portions were quite generous!!!! A golf kart can be used FOC to get around the grounds which was of great use!!!Anyway if you are put off by the price don't be.... An unforgettable experience in splendid hotel in amazing environment . 

Dublin, Ireland",5,2013,07,30
217,One of the most beautiful hotels,"The hotel, though far away from Dublin airport, was perfectly remote. It was located in an area perfect for outdoor activities especially for walking and jogging. The spa services were open to everyone and I can say it is one of the best-equipped hotel spas I have ever seen. The restaurants there also offered world-class cuisine and the staff was almost perfect. This really is a truly memorable hotel.",5,2013,07,30
217,Lovely hotel,"We stayed at the hotel in May. Beautiful location and hotel. I wasn't crazy about the architecture on the outside, but the inside was gorgeous. Beautiful flowers in the lobby area. We had a suite that overlooked the back of the property. The suite was incredible. Very large with full kitchen, one and a half baths, living room, dining area, bedroom, huge dressing area with 4 closets, bath with tub, huge walk in shower, two vanities, even a bidet in the water closet. And everything was operated from a little electronic panel on the wall. Huge terrace that you could reach from living room and bedroom. Perfect!
We ate in Enniskerry one evening and at the pub in the hotel the other evening. Pub was very good, casual food. Our only issue was one morning we went to the dining area on the lobby level to order breakfast. We only wanted coffee and bagels, but were told by the server that we had to order the whole buffet. So we left. We were later told that we didn't have to order the buffet, so not sure which was the correct answer. However, when we checked out, we were charged for the buffet, but it was immediately taken off the bill when I explained that we did not have breakfast there and why. Parking was very convenient.  The staff was okay, but I would not say over friendly, except for the pub. Very nice and attentive. 
We would go back, although I have heard that this will not be a Ritz property for much longer. Again, I'm not sure if that info is correct. So, if you do want a Ritz, check before you go. 
One last thing, we drove from the hotel to Glendalough, the ruins of a monastic settlement. Beautiful and a must see.",4,2013,07,29
217,Fabulous,"Absolutely loved this hotel. Beautiful hotel, beautiful location, friendly staff. Hotel facilities are first class and lovely food. Would definitely stay here again. We ate in McGuills bar and were so happy that we hadn't ordered starters as the main courses were hugh. The buffet breakfast the next morning was fabulous. We ate on the balcony outside as the weather was lovely and could have stayed there all day. Bring your walking shoes and get out and enjoy the beautiful surroundings.",5,2013,07,28
217,Lovely hotel in the Wicklow Mountains,We started our tour of Ireland here after reading about a rate for the hotel with dinner and breakfast at the Gordon Ramsay restaraunt in the hotel.  The hotel is within walking distance of The Powerscourt House and and Gardens as well as the quaint town of Enniskerry.  The hotel is not only set in a gorgeous place but the staff and facility are what you would expect from a Ritz Carlton hotel.  They even had a great pub called McGills.  There is a lovely waterfall 5 miles away and a lovely hike along the river.,5,2013,07,28
217,Nice Property; Wonderful Staff,"My wife and I stayed here for 2 nights at the end of our Ireland trip.  It's a beautiful building set on expansive grounds and located out in the country about a 30 minute drive from Dublin Airport.  The staff were absolutely wonderful.  I emailed with a question in advance of our arrival and received a prompt reply from the Concierge.  Check in was very prompt and we were given a lovely upgraded suite with a beautiful view over the grounds.  

Breakfast in the restaurant was great.  Lots of variety and good food.  There is a pub on site where we had dinner both nights.  Good food and drinks.

All staff were friendly, interested in helping us as needed and seemed genuinely happy to be there.  Interesting in light of the fact that the hotel had just been sold and the new owners had announced changes including dropping the Ritz Carlton flag in favor of Marriott Autograph Collection.  I think though that they did announce that all jobs would be retained which might account for the happiness (or relief) level of the employees.

The only nit I will pick with the hotel is that there did seem to be a bit of deferred maintenance visible around the grounds.  Hopefully the new owners will address this although I must admit that it is a huge task given how expansive the property is.

All in all a great visit.  Wouldn't hesitate to return.",4,2013,07,27
217,"Could be so much more, disappointing","greeted by a very pleasant consierge who offered to carry our bags too a trolley.  Good start. We were checked in as I had a Visa debit card I was informed they would charge me €415 not the €265 I had expected to pay, why? Just incase I wanted to charge to my room (a bit rich I think not very 5*) the child friendly check in was a quick hello to my son ??  Why promote this if you don't automatically do this? We were shown  to the lifts and room which was the nicest thing about the hotel the room was spacious and the bathroom was nice, there was no need for all the electronic gadgets, the air con didn't go low enough the room was warm at night.  €5 for a Coke =rip off.  The spa facilities are extremely poor. There are plenty of extremely expensive treatments but I did not feel encouraged to try any as we were greeted in such a rude manner on arrival for a swim at 4pm, a male staff member abruptly informed us that children should be out at 6 and did we know it was 4pm??? Child friendly??? Depends on who meets you as I saw another family being given a tour of the area before they swam. So after a swim i look for the rest of the sp to be informed if one does not have a treament one has only access to the pool and steam area, which is very average just a pool(no views! the hotel is in the Garden of Ireland why did they not have views or outdoor pool area,  the pool area was at a cool temperature, the whirl pool/jaccuzi only worked every 15 min or so and on one side only when it did go on it was too gentle, the staff spent most of their time ensuring others did not allow children in it, the shower in the pool broken, the steam room which was fair, nothing special. We were told there is a sauna but one must have a treatment to use it.  We observed an employee who removed dirty towels from the chairs but this only happens once, but did not change the wet covers.  Not a standard of a 5 star hotel
The dinner was ok the Gordon R place had a party on so that was a no go area. The sweets at the end of the dinner were the best thing about the hotel they were to die for.  As I did not spend all the money taken from my card I was told at check out it was being refunded that was yesterday I'm still waiting for the refund to go back into my account. 

Overall
Staff ok a bit ott but in general ok
Room lovely and big I liked it 
Balcony big with view 
Spa was a big disappointment 
Food ok
Too expensive
Drinks ridiculous prices 
No water in rooms your told to use the tap or pay €5 a bottle come on this is supposed to be 5* I expect still and sparkling water 
Breakfast not great queuing undercooked sausages not a great selection, a long wait for eggs, glasses etc this must be  improved  
I felt like it was a hotel with so much potential but needs a fresh approach, change your prices and fix your spa and make a thermal suite for all guests.",3,2013,07,26
217,Beautiful hotel and location,"We chose this hotel over the Renaissance in downtown Dublin because the price and even though we had to drive a bit from Dublin airport, it was worth it! I do have little complaints though.

The parking was almost full, for such a big hotel, they should have more parking space.

The man who checked us in was really nice, he asked us where we were from and coincidentally, he spoke our language! He upgraded us to a suite, since we're gold members of Marriott. We went to lunch at the Sugar Loaf Lounge, which was really nice and they had good food. 

The room was outstanding, with the electronic systems to switch the lights on/off, close/open the curtains, and we could even watch television in the bathroom! 

We had dinner in the pub, which was not the best unfortunately. The food was okay, but the table was sticky and the waiters did not come to us at first and they were also not very nice, they seemed bored. (I don't know if that's normal). 

Breakfast buffet was good! There were many choices and they were really quick with the eggs I asked to be made to order.",4,2013,07,26
217,"Location,location!","it really is one of the finest hotels, the view of Sugar Loaf mountain is fantastic.  Great to get out of Dublin city and only half hour drive. Service in reception and housekeeping above and beyond nothing was to much trouble.  We were on the sixth floor and spent a great deal of time sitting out on the patio soaking in the view and peace and tranquility.
Cant wait to go back!",5,2013,07,24
217,Simply the Best,"I have only a few points to add to the other gushing reviews: (1) if you decide to play golf, play the west course, because it is much better, (2) the swimming pool is fantastic, (3) have breakfast on the terrace, (4) you must try the chocolate ice cream, (5) do not miss Powerscourt House and Gardens next door (they do great lunches too). Like other reviewers, I worry that standards may drop, now that Marriott have bought the whole state for $1M Euros with debts of $83M. Fingers crossed.",5,2013,07,20
217,Heaven on Earth!,"Powerscourt Gardens, in Enniskerry, Wicklow has always been my favorite place to visit in Ireland. Each time I am there I am wowed all over again! Then take one of the finest hotels in the world and place it in this breathtaking setting and there you go, The Ritz Carlton, Powerscourt! From moment we walked through the door we were impressed and giddy with happiness that we got to be guests at this stunning hotel. It's pure luxury every step of the way. The lobby is stunning and the rooms are too. We had deluxe rooms I believe. They were huge and luxurious. Our view out onto the expansive lawn and fountain with the Sugarloaf Mountains as the backdrop was really spectacular. The pool is ultra chic with it's black mosaic tile and dim lighting. So cool! My family enjoyed every moment and can't wait to return someday.",5,2013,07,20
217,ABOVE excellent :),"Whoever wrote the review saying this was over priced and under delivered...well, we didn't stay at the same place.

We were amazed by the service, better than A++, better than excellent. 

The room perfect, the housekeeping impeccable. Our housekeeper, Chris, left extra water for us and cleaned our room spotless. I saw Chris cleaning the bathrooms near the Pub and their were some drunken wedding guys being really obnoxious to him. He just smiled and went about his job.  

The 3D concierge, the woman had lived in NY (blonde, about my age - late 30s, I would guess, oh I forgot her name!). She was amazing. We were renewing our vows and I forgot my flowers...She had a bouquet made up from the roses out of the garden, they were beautiful and just what we wanted. And kept insisting not to tip her, that it was really her pleasure. WOW

Our spa services were more than just spa services. The luxury pedicure, don't get anything less, and ask for Kate. She did a great job and was wonderful company to boot. Karen gave my husband a massage that he still talks about. Karen was from Bray and talked about it's beauty,so my husband and I drove there on our way back to Dublin. Thank you Karen, it was one of our cherished moments being in Bray. 

There was a man from Poland or Hungry I believe that delivered our bags and gave us a tour of our room. We saw him intermittently through out our visit and he always greeted us with a smile. He was so friendly and welcoming, so thankful for the tip (unlike anyone on our trip) and acted thankful just to be there, it made us want to be there more. 

Now, for the Pub... McGill's! We are McGill's, and going to the McGill's Pub was top of our list for our whole trip to Ireland. We knew it was in the hotel and seeing the pictures of the elegance of the hotel, we knew it would be a bit classier than the Irish Pubs from movies. It was, but it still felt like a pub. 

The bar manager, Ian, top notch man. He had the cook make a special order of parsnips for me... at the bar. He let my husband pull a pint of Guinness while we had our wedding photographer there. Ian was a great manager, even gave us a pub menu cover that said ""McGills"" so we could put a wedding picture in it. 

Bartender - David; David made our trip to the pub so special. His jokes and riddles and stories and perfectly poured Guinness.... he was like a friend from home. 

Upon leaving, the desk clerks were all wearing name tags that said ""The McGills"" .... they made us name tags! They were all so nice, SINCERELY nice. 

Now for the so so's. The lounge, not so good. The Guinness in the lounge...not like David poured it, didn't taste or look the same. We told David, and he went to Ian and they were appalled, said they would find out who poured it and make sure it was right from now on. The food in the lounge, not so good. When you pay that much, you expect a little something. It was so so. 

I almost didn't mention the lounge because everything was so amazing! I give reviews, and I give good reviews, this place is above all those, it should have it's own rating. We got more than we paid for, and memories that will last us a life time. Thank you everyone at The Ritz and Powerscourt Gardens... we will be back",5,2013,07,19
217,"Gorgeous, luxurious property","This place is an amazing getaway location located in the Wicklow area south of Dublin. We had the good fortune to stay here for one night on the tail end of a driving tour of Ireland, and thought it was a fantastic way to get some much needed R&R for our road-weary selves. We made the choice to upgrade from our basic king room to a suite overlooking the woods in the back of the hotel (see the rooms along the top of building shown the photo? That was us!) and it was worth every penny. Our huge suite was decadently appointed with luxury linens, touch screen appliances, and a cavernous marble bathroom. 

In addition, the grounds are gorgeous (a visit to the gardens at next door Powerscourt is a must), the staff very professional, and the restaurant was top notch. On the night we stayed it was my birthday, and they allowed us to send our dinner's dessert along with a bottle of champagne from our table to our room, so that we could finish our dinner on our suite's gorgeous veranda. Would highly recommend, and stay here again!",5,2013,07,19
217,Awesome Stay,"to end our journey to Ireland. THe location of this hotel is nice. Walk to Enniskerry town center (if you dont want the free ride service), Walk to the Powerscourt Gardens, Easy bus ride to Bray to catch the dart into Dublin and just a short ride south to THe Wickow Mountains and hiking in Glengolaugh. We had room 512, beautiful room with views of the mountains in the background with woods view just outside the windows. 
Staff was impecible especially the Gordon Ramsay's staff. 

With all this said, I wonder what will happen when it turns into a Marriot. A bit scared as we were planning a return visit here next april, but we all know what comes with the change in ownership brings here in the states. We are goiing to look good and hard with what happens to the hotel after October 1. 

Oh i fergot, The breakfast each morning is well worth the extra change. Best breakfast all 2 weeks we were in ireland.",5,2013,07,16
217,Fantastic treat!,"We spent a night here with a spa treatment & dinner included in the package. We loved every minute, the room was so spacious, the staff friendly, the spa spectacular & the food delicious. To top it all off the weather was stunning and the views breathtaking. We really enjoyed our stay - it was a treat and we'll definitely be back again!!",5,2013,07,16
217,THE RITZ,"Stayed 3 nights in early November. Hotel was immaculate. Gorgeous building combining Old World and New. Great high end restaurant along with your typical and economical Irish Pub. Regular Deluxe Room was beautiful and large. Bathroom with TV in mirror and amazing shower.
INCREDIBLE PROPERTY.  Over 1000 acres of hills, lakes, gardens, 2 golf courses, directly adjacent to Powerscourt House ( Mansion ) and Gardens, a must see. All in County Wicklow, 20 minutes from Dublin.",5,2013,07,16
217,Amazing stay,"We stayed for 2 nights in a garden view suite and it was simply wonderful. The staff, the room, the facilities, the setting all of it was great and probably the best all round 5 star hotel I have stayed. I would recommend staying Sunday to Tuesday as I imagine the hotel could be very busy on a Friday and Saturday with functions especially weddings in the fabulous setting. I would highly recommend this as a peaceful and romantic get away. A must do is dinner in Gordon Ramsey on site restaurant, lovely food, service and quite good value considering.  ",5,2013,07,15
217,"Amazing building, Disappointing experience","Beautiful location. Went to Hotel to have afternoon tea, was told this was not possible as 24hours prior notice was required. We agreed to go to the pub-restaurant then to have a light lunch. Requested 2 menus when we ordered drinks & lady returned to take order 35 minutes later so out of principle we did not order food.",3,2013,07,14
217,One of our best hotel experiences ever!,"From the moment you drive into the property, you know you're in a very special place.  The staff is friendly and helpful and the property is unbelievably beautiful.  We made a reservation at the Gordon Ramsey restaurant which was delicious and a real treat but the lobby restaurant was also good and we enjoyed a meal at McGill's Irish Pub as well.  The breakfast buffet is amazing and the waitstaff were all incredibly attentive and friendly.  A trip (or two) to the inviting spa is a must!",5,2013,07,14
217,Impressive building and mostly impressive staff,"Was upgraded to a king size suite for a 2 night stay. Hotel and room certainly had the wow factor. Unfortunately small niggles that I wouldn't expect for these prices soon appeared - bathroom TV didn't work, all the clocks were wrong, the in room folder had been scribbled in, the mini bar wasn't refurbished during my stay, one of the bedroom curtains was broken, no plug near a mirror for hair appliances. AND my ultimate horror - the evening turndown service ignoring my do not disturb sign and entering the room while I was out, even though the room had been serviced that afternoon. The evening before they had nicely left a card outside acknowledging my wish to not be disturbed. All they did in the room was tidy the bathroom and turn the sheets down - wouldn't have thought that justified ignoring a guest's request for privacy. Returning alone to a room which had obviously had someone in (and who had decided to leave some quiet, classical music playing on the TV akin to a horror film) made me want to search the wardrobes before retiring! Please Ritz Carlton, this situation didn't warrant a welfare entrance so tell your staff to respect a DND and leave a note as they did the first night.",4,2013,07,14
217,What an experience!,"Just spent two nights at the Ritz Carlton Powerscourt.. Wow, what an experience. The customer service is out of this world. Every member of staff seems happy to be at work. My room was enormous - you could fit the whole of the downstairs of my house into it! 
I stayed here for a conference and couldn't fault the hotel for anything. The food was superb. The views at breakfast from the terrace of the Gordon Ramsay restaurant breathtaking. I really must return with my husband!",5,2013,07,13
217,Great fun,Stayed with work national conference and they looked after us a treat. Room was huge and clean and comfortable with free wifi. Beautiful gardens and great food. McGill Irish themed pub had atmosphere and the Guinness was great,4,2013,07,12
217,My favourite hotel,"I recently stayed here and all I can say is wow,,the rooms the staff the grounds the restaurants the pool the building itself are all amazing. It's a treat to stay in such a nice hotel and the service is impeccable.",5,2013,07,11
217,Location and staff makes it worth every penny,"About 30 minutes from the Dublin airport and next to the Powersourt gardens, this hotel easily embodies the Ritz brand.  We had a spacious suite on the sixth floor facing Sugarloaf mountain, with a balcony that ran the length of the suite.  The bed was comfortable and the closets more than adequate.  A few downsides. When I spilled some water on the hard wood floors and grabbed a towel to wipe it up, the floor was filthy.  A request for extra pillows was responded to timely, only to have them removed the next morning.  The lighting on the balcony didn't function, but wasn't an issue as the sun didn't set until 10:30pm in June.  Also, in most Ritz hotels there is a premium lounge.  It appears that the ""Sally Gap""  room used to meet that purpose, but has been converted into a conference room.  The Gordon Ramsey restaurant and McGills Pub were average at best.  The best assets of this hotel are its staff and its location.   The small town of Enniskerry became our favorite place to grab a bite before or after our sightseeing excursions.",4,2013,07,11
217,We need more Ritz Hotels in Europe,"This property is magnificent. It's next to the Powerscourt Gardens, just a five minute walk. The staff is very friendly, and typically for the Ritz an international blend. The rooms are great (get #603 if you can), well designed and spacious.

Gordon Ramsey's restaurant is one of the best dining experiences I've had in the Ritz chain. We did the tasting menu @ the Chef's table in the kitchen and it was a tremendous experience.

Free internet/wifi is not normal for a Ritz, but it was included here.

The hotel is about a 45 minute drive south of the Dublin airport.

We were told by locals that the property just went through a bankruptcy, but other than what appeared to be a lean staff, we didn't feel it.

Only negative was that the spa on our patio was not operating. We asked on our first day to have it repaired but they didn't get around to it by our departure 3 days later.",5,2013,07,09
217,"Toyota's ""Top Performers"" Vacation of the year!","We spent a week in Ireland and can not say enough about our stay with The Ritz-Carlton Powerscourt.  This is a first class Hotel/Resort with large rooms, very comfortable feather beds, dressing room and bathroom to die for!  The automated touchscreens that controlled almost everything in the room was really amazing!  So much to see on the Powerscourt property as well as the nearby town of Enniskerry.  A visit to Enniskerry (a town founded by the staff at Powerscourt castle many years ago), is like a step back in time.  A village out of a storybook.  And Dublin is only about 20 minutes away with lots to see and great shopping.  We were part of a large group of Toyota managers and wives/husbands.  Toyota picked a wonderful place this year for the ""Top Performers"" getaway!  We would definitely be interested in returning for another visit to the Ritz!",5,2013,07,08
217,Presidents Conference at the Ritz,"This was my first stay at the Ritz in Ireland!  This hotel is about 45 minutes from the Dublin airport!  We took a cab and it a scenic drive up into the mountains!  This is a great hotel with large spacious rooms.  We stayed in room 112 which is a large and spacious room.  This room has two queen beds with a desk a sofa and two sitting chairs!  The room has 4 large closets and a marble bathroom with separate shower and jacuzzi tub and potty room the bathroom also has two sinks. This room has very few plugs but they do provide a converter box!  

The service at this Hotel is great!  When we ordered room service the food arrived in 15 minutes!  The spa and gym are very up to date and they have great equipment in the workout facility.  The buffet breakfast is wonderful and the food is very good.  

We played the West Course at the Powerscourt Golf Course.  They also have a very challenging layout at the West Course.  ",5,2013,06,30
217,Incredibly lovely property,"Stayed here for two nights using Marriott rewards points. We were blown away by the beauty of the property. Our room was a king bed suite that faced the mountains. It was a very large and luxurious suite, 1 1/2 bathrooms, kitchen, living room, lovely bedroom and an incredible master bath. It is probably the most high end place We have stayed. The spa and pool are incredible as well, the pictures on the website do not do justice to the pool. Would definitely spend the money to eat at Gordon Ramsey restaurant, we loved it, however, it was pricey. McGills was a cute pub. The regular restaurant was also quite good. Highly, highly recommend this beautiful place. It is out in the country, very peaceful and relaxing. ",5,2013,06,30
217,"A beautiful stay, perfect for relaxing","My husband and I only live a short distance away, but with two little boys, one with special needs, we wanted to take some time out and also, not be too far away. Luckily for us, this hotel fitted the bill perfectly! 

The welcome team were the most professional I have ever came across worldwide, and not in a cheesy way either, something that grates on me, when asked what room we had, he pleasantly informed us that there was an upgrade made and Fiachra brought us to our suite. Gorgeous. The bed was blissful and I must say, the temperature of the room was amazing.

We thoroughly enjoyed the pool, Hammam steam room and would have liked the chill out rooms upstairs with infinity pools etc, but the lady at the desk informed us that since they were split by sex, my husband and I would have to enjoy them apart, so we opted against for the extra money.

Unfortunately, both the Gordon Ramsey resto and the treatment rooms were fully booked when we arrived, so we ate in mcgills pub, which was surprisingly delicious and a fraction of the cost of the restaurant. I don't think I would bother eating in the restaurant next time either! 

Breakfast was heavenly. The only reason this hotel didn't get five stars from me was due to the price of the extras....music in the rooms was being charged at €5.50 and the radio wasn't tuned in correctly, so left us with no alternative. You could spend a lot of ,emy here and at times.things were very expensive. 

We spent our morning discussing dates to return! In the words of Arnold S.....I'll be back!",4,2013,06,29
217,Fantastic stay,"If you feel yourself in need of a little bit of relaxation and quiet time then this is a good place to go. We stayed here for just one night and it was fabulous. A beautiful room ... Very spacious with private balcony/patio area, huge walk in wardrobe and lovely bathroom. Everything was spotless. We had midday coffee and scones which were freshly baked and gorgeous. Dinner that evening was also gorgeous. It's hard to describe the wonderful breakfast, you definitely wouldn't leave hunger. Cannot wait to return...",5,2013,06,27
217,Staying at the Ritz,"Just returned from a two week stay in Ireland with 4 of my girlfriends.  We concluded our trip with a three day two night stay at the Ritz Carlton at Powerscourt.  I cant say enough good things about our stay.  From the minute the car arrives you are treated like celebrities.  I don't know how they do it but they seem to know every guest by name. The facility, and surroundings are just gorgeous.  A truly nice surprise awaited us upon check in - we were upgraded to two suites at no additional charge.  We had a delicious dinner at Gordon Ramsey and wonderful pub fare at McGills.  We were on a bed and breakfast package so breakfast was also included and they had everything and anything you could ask for.  All top of the line.  The location made it the perfect spot to walk over to Powerscourt gardens.  The Ritz even gave us a free ride to the little town center - then cam back and picked us up.   It was the perfect stay for the four of us and I would recommend it highly.  It was certainly worth every penny.",5,2013,06,26
217,Picturesque location and Luxury Comfort.,"Our hotel stay took place during the last week in March, 2013.  Our suite was spacious, luxurious and impeccable.  The bathroom is a large with floor to ceiling marble.  It is equipped with 2 sinks, plenty of storage for towels and personal hygiene products, a hair dryer (nicely hidden in the vanity, a large glass mirror with built-on television, separate toilet room with glass door, separate shower with glass door and a 2-person Jacuzzi tub.  The floors are always warm due to below ground heater. This was my favorite bathroom feature.  There is nothing more satisfying than being able to walk barefoot after your shower or long, cold day outdoors.  Outside of the bathroom was a dressing room with floor to ceiling storage and closet space.  The sitting room was beautifully decorated with a desk and chair (wifi included) as well as a large couch, coffee table, end tables, Queen Anne chairs, flat screen television and table.  The bedroom was at the opposite end and separate by two wood-sliding pocket doors. Our room had two double beds.  Each bed was roomy enough for one adult and a child.  In this room is also a dresser and television as well as a night stand.   Curtains, temperature and lighting were all controlled electronically via digital controls located at the entrance, living room and bedroom.  This took a day or two to completely understand but then we caught on.  The breakfast buffet at the Gordon Ramsay restaurant is absolutely delicious!  The service was excellent and our servers were friendly and courteous. We would enjoy a filling meal in the morning and were offered a few snacks for our daily travels.  This held us over until we had a late lunch or early dinner.  Although we did not have dinner at the Gordon Ramsay, we did visit McGills.  Unfortunately, the service was terrible.  Our server had a terrible attitude and disposition.  The food and drink were just average.  The Powerscourt Gardens are a must-see.  The grounds are so beautiful.  Even in the midst of bitter-cold, snowy days, it was just breathtaking.  Take the time (half day recommended) to enjoy the sites of Powerscourt Gardens and its surroundings.  You will not be disappointed.  Overall, our experience was fantastic.",5,2013,06,25
217,Pure Luxury!,"Gorgeous hotel set in beautiful surroundings. Stayed here for one night for my birthday. It's pricey but worth it. We stayed in a suite and it was well worth the extra money with two bathrooms, separate living room, dressing room and spacious bedroom giving the feeling of real luxury. Given the high price tag I would have expected complimentary water and better quality tea & coffee. Having told them I was celebrating my birthday they put a card and hand made chocolates into the room which was a nice touch. The only real negative was the price of a cappuccino in the sugar loaf lounge... e5.30 for what was only an average coffee at best. We were also able to use the pool after checkout which was great, well worth a visit. Can't wait to return!",5,2013,06,23
217,A very nice stay but Gordon Ramsey Restaurant is a disappointment,"We had a great stay at this hotel.  As a Marriott Platinum member we were upgraded to a fantastic suite with a private patio.  The room was immaculate and the furnishings top of the line.  The staff was courteous and most helpful.  This is a nice stroll from Powerscourt House and within an easy drive (5 minutes) of Irelands highest waterfall.  The staff was great with all directions to the local sites as well as our trip to Glendalough the next day (they recommended a more scenic route).
As for the restaurant.  While we found the food quite good the service left much to be desired.  They brought my wife a Manhattan when we ordered a Cosmo, and they rushed our appetizer even though I told them we wanted to enjoy our cocktails.  All in all 3 STAR service.
As a side note I saw a small article in one of the Irish newspapers that the Hotel has been bought by Innerstate Hotels and will no longer be a Ritz starting in October, so if you are planning to travel on points or enjoy your upgrades you should keep that in mind.",5,2013,06,23
217,Lovely stay,Room was nice - spacious with a separate dressing area.  Large marble bathroom with separate shower and a TV recessed into the mirror.  Beautiful grounds with a view of Sugar Loaf and just a short walk from the Powerscourt House and Gardens.  Apparently a wedding or other celebration was being held as we unexpectedly enjoyed a fabulous fireworks display from our room window.  The air conditioner did not cool as much as we would have liked (minimum setting is 19 degrees but our sound machine thermometer actually showed 22 degrees) but not too bad.  Ask the concierge for a pass to the River Walk.  Self parking was as close and convenient as any resort parking I have ever experienced.,4,2013,06,18
217,Very special Hotel but skip Gordon Ramsey Restaurant (not letting GR impact this rating as it is a separate review),"We stayed there for three nights.  Both of us are platinum elites in Marriott system so we were upgraded to a suite.  The suite was wonderfully appointed and we loved - loved - loved the their brand of spa products in the room (sounds funny to say but its true).  As noted by other reviewers, the high tech light system did take a few minutes to figure out the first night as we were tying to turn off all the lights, but that was minor in comparison to how much we loved it once we got comfortable with it. Imagine opening all the exterior curtains in a room with one button in the morning.  The pool was....well....too fantastic to describe here.  The sauna was state of the art and was supported by cool down sauna area and multiple cool down showers i.e. rain vs bucket poor etc depending on your level of courage.  We only wished we had found it earlier in our stay. The hotel staff we interacted with were attentive and made authentic personal connections.  The pub was closed when we were there so we dined in the Gorden Ramsey restaurant twice which was a major disappointment.  The view from the restaurant was lovely but the food was awful on both occasions.  We told our server the fist night but due to the limited menu, which was even more limited as I am allergic to fish - nothing could be done and he didn't offer to get creative so we ended up making most of our dinner from granola bars we had brought with us after our ""oh so anticipated"" dinner at the famous GR.  The next morning our eggs were over cooked but we were too hungry to send those back too.  As a foodie, makes me suspect that they just rent the Gorden R name.  Would highly recommend the hotel but skip the GR restaurant.  Eat in the pub or go into town for a editable meal as we did after two bad experiences..",5,2013,06,14
217,"OVER-NIGHTER...GREAT PLACE, VERY RELAXED","We stayed when In Dublin recently and got a good price. Its a fantastic place and we took our baby who came for a swim in the pool, beware there are baby firendly opening hours. The food in the pub downstairs is superb, The views from our room are of the sugarloaf. We had a few issues with our TV, te sound was terrible and couldnt be fixed. They gave us free wine and popcorn as it wasnt feasible to move rooms due to baby sleeping. The room was massive and so clean and immaculate finishings....highly recommend it.",5,2013,06,12
217,You can't go wrong with the Ritz,"Stayed there for my husband's birthday. From the moment we checked in everything was excellent, service amazing, friendly and very professional just like you would expect at   Ritz.
The Greek guy at the bar was very funny, chatty and entertaining.
The food at Gordon Ramsey restaurant was world class, very reasonably priced. 
We got invited to see the kitchen and it was very interesting experience.
The pool was great and very clean.
We got free upgrade and were more than happy with our room.
Without hesitation we'll be back.",5,2013,06,09
217,Luxury hotel in the woods,"Very nice hotel with a good breakfast. It is a very big hotel and the rooms are awesome. A little bit sofisticated with all the high tech stuff but very nice. The people are very nice. 
It is living in the woods, peace and quiet at the top.",5,2013,06,07
217,Pleasant stay,"We arrived mid-morning on a busy Saturday after an overseas flight, and only had to wait about an hour for our room. The hotel is ideally situation if you fly into Dublin, but don't want to stay in the city. It was about an hour's drive on mostly motorways. Parking at the hotel is very convenient, and the hotel itself is lovely and quiet. We had a room facing the garden in the back of the hotel. All the staff we encountered were extremely kind and helpful. You can walk to the Powerscourt House and Gardens from the hotel. We did not dine in the Gorden Ramsey restaurant as we were jet lagged and afraid we would not enjoy it as it should be enjoyed. The pub was a nice alternative.

The only issue we had with the hotel was the computerized electronics in the room. We had trouble turning the lights on and off! Maybe it was because of the jet lag, but it would be so much simpler to just flip a switch! We would recommend this hotel if you are planning to be in the area and are looking for luxury.",5,2013,06,05
217,made feel so welcome!,"stayed here on a package in oct'12 , faultless from start to finish, staff really warm, dinner in ramsays was great and drinks and live music in the trad bar made for a great night. breakfast buffet was first class. highly recommended",5,2013,06,04
217,The Ritz Powerscourt Rocks!,"May 19, 2013 
We arrived Sunday morning around 10AM. Way before check-in, however, employee Rui at the front desk greeted us cheerfully and surprised us by having our room ready. What a lovely treat after a flight from NYC. We were shown to our room and given a tour of the touchpad controls, television in the bathroom mirror and the coffee/tea available in room. 
Since we had a room credit with our package we decided on the club sandwich and chips from room service. our food arrived quickly and was rolled in on a table for two, very impressive. The food was wonderful, so good we ordered again on Monday for lunch in the car on the way to Lisdoonvarna!
I can honestly say every employee I encountered was professional, friendly and always offered a greeting. The young man, Michael who drove me into town for snacks waited curbside for me and told me about the area on the short drive. And Trish the concierge went out of her way to print directions for me before we left. The front desk staff made sure we knew all about the gardens next door, as well as the shops and café. We had planned to visit Glendalough from here but wandered too long at the gardens. It is a great location for seeing this part of Ireland.
Although this was my first stay with a Ritz Carlton it will certainly not be my last. Spectacular hotel, amazing employees, surrounding scenery that will take your breath away. I left feeling like a princess and didn't even mind that I had turned another year older on the night of my stay!
Well done Ritz!! You got it ALL right!!",5,2013,06,03
217,Best hotel i know and come here regular,"I have stayed in this hotel 4 times in the last 8 months. 

First time was for my boyfriends birthday and I emailed to say could a cake be made for it , I didn't receive any prices or any information so I thought they didn't have enough time. That night we got knock on door and cake came - was lovely with all the things I wanted on I also fresh cream!!! I called reception to see if I was being charged for it and said it was free. I thought that was just lovely and our best time there.

Second and third was lovely to - third time I used spa and had excellent massage and wrap.

This whole place is amazing : spa , restaurant , afternoon tea , grounds. It has it all for a price I don't think is too expensive! The only thing I can say is: if you want to mainly be in Dublin city maybe not best hotel for this. But for me its worth it all the time!

Will be back soon !",5,2013,06,01
217,Top notch quality hotel-BEAUTIFUL location,"I've been to several Ritz Carltons and all are in a beautiful location. This property is no exception. To get to it you drive through a tiny little town, and up a very scenic drive. The exterior of this hotel is not what you would expect. But once you get inside, it's just beautiful. It was built in 2007, but looks like it was built in the early 1900s. It was just very beautifully built and decorated.
The entire staff from reception, concierge, to the wait staff is exceptionally friendly and helpful. All are helpful to give you directions, recommendations or any assitance they can give you.

The property of this hotel is beautiful and makes you feel like you are out in the very remote Irish country side though it's a very short 25 minute drive to Dublin.

The only negative I can you this hotel is that there is no club level like many marriots. Breakfast is not included and though it's good, it doesn't knock your socks off. The eggs in the UK are served very undercooked for American standards but the price of the breakfast does include eggs cooked to your liking without further charge-you just ask your waiter.

I would return to this property without hesitation. Kate at reception was exceptionally helpful and friendly and extended our stay by 1 night even though they were very full. It made our trip!  There are many beautiful hotels in the world, but it's service like this that make the Ritz-Carlton world class.",5,2013,05,31
217,Best hotel,"This was our splurge hotel for one night, I cannot put in to words how nice the rooms were.  I'm more of a modern decor person but the old world decor was fun.  Everything is luxurious.  You can automatically open your curtains from bed, heated floors, the bathroom is OUTSTANDING, the bed is so soft and cozy, the mountain view is gorgeous, the staff makes you feel like a king or queen, room service is amazing, the food was great.  This is everything you would expect from The Ritz!  A fantastic splurge!",5,2013,05,30
217,Simply Luxury,"Quite simply 5* luxury in a beautiful surrounding and quality decor.  The rooms have gadgets that I didn't think any place would ever think of needing, but each one adds to the whole experience.  My only criticism would be that if you give in your debit card when you check in,they deduct the value immediately, meaning that nothing can then be charged to the room.  This was very strange we thought, maybe other people know the reason why.  
We had coffee in one of the lounges, overlooking the gardens, which was lovely and relaxing.
That evening, we had dinner in Gordon Ramsays restaurant, which enhanced the whole stay, and the diiner and service was immaculate; topped off by a choclate cake with happy honeymoon written in chocolate on the plate. This was a lovely gesture.
The rooms are spacious and comfortable.
The spa area is clean and easy to get to. The steam room is lovely but the plunge bucket after the steam room is like a form of self-torture.
We will definately stay here again, and can't wait to get back there.",5,2013,05,29
217,First Class all the way!,"This property is exceptional!  The staff is friendly and helpful, the grounds are so lovely and the incredible room was so comfy that it honestly made even the rainiest days more enjoyable.  Every convenience.  GREAT morning buffet.  The pub on the property is fun and the food there is great.  Being a bit outside of Dublin proved to be a good move and this location is quite convenient to many areas.  We were able to have an incredible holiday which we will remember forever!!!",5,2013,05,28
217,Fabulous,"love this hotel, the restaurant in the main lobby has the most amazing club sandwich. Service is fantastic and staff are very friendly and helpful. A great place to visit within walking distance of powerscourt house with its gorgeous avoca restaurant and shops, powers court golf also right across from the hotel and enniskerry village a ten min walk away. overall it has all the best of everything right on your doorstep!!!",5,2013,05,28
217,"Great food, hotel service patchy","Fantastic food at Gordon Ramsay, the food quality, execution and service was excellent absolutely fautless. Breakfast however was a disapointment, it was dfficult to order anything a la carte in fact we were positively discouraged from doing so, the food quality and buffet choice was excellent. The Suite was nothing special with evident wear and tear, beds were very comfortable and the suite was large with amazing views of the mountains.  The do not disturb   was ignored by housekeeping and service in reception and by the concierge was lacking except for a few exceptions.  My bill had charges on which were incorrect and it took a very long time to sort it out without any meaningful apology. Other than Restauarnt Gordon Ramsay there isn't much to tempt me back here for a second stay.",4,2013,05,28
217,'LUXURY AT ITS BEST',"This hotel has to be the finest I have stayed in to date. The staff are very friendly and efficient especially Paulina who gave us delicious cappuccino's and has great customer care qualities.The rooms are amazing with remote control to open curtains, play music and a tv screen inset into the mirror in the bathroom. The room was kept clean and has AC. The sugar loaf restaurant has a beautiful view of the mountain itself and a great variety of tasty food. We dined in The Gordan Ramsey definitely worth a visit, the food was presented beautifully and 'the taste' well it lives up to its name. Overall this hotel ticks all the boxes and I will be returning.",5,2013,05,28
217,Needs a little tlc,"Had the pleasure of staying here last month. Found the staff overall very friendly and welcoming.

Couple of things I would like to point out 
1. Milk in bedroom was sour.

2. Staff in bar were a little unprofessional, myself and my friend could here another member of staff being discussed!

Overall a very nice stay, amazing views.",3,2013,05,28
217,Love this place,"This is my second time to the hotel and I loved it just as much as the first time. I originally stayed here a year ago when I got engaged and we were in one of the top suites in the hotel. The room was nearly as big as my house!!The service here is amazing and the food is also fantastic. I visited again last weekend with my two aunts from Australia and had high tea here. They loved it as much as I do. Even though the hotel is big, it never feels overcrowded and there is a real calmness about all the staff. They are incredibly attentive and really helpful.",5,2013,05,27
217,Cannot say enough good things about this hotel,"My husband and I recently got married at this stunning property and everything, I mean everything in one word was PERFECT!  The staff are truly exceptional.  The guest rooms are beautifully appointed and the grounds are breath-taking.  I simply cannot say enough good things about this hotel, the leadership team and the staff.  It is a must-see, must-stay, must-enjoy resort.   My compliments to the General Manager for leading such a fine establishment.  And finally a sincere and heartfelt thank you for creating memories for life for me, my husband, our families and friends.  We will be back very soon.",5,2013,05,26
217,excellent stay,lovely hotel with outstanding service by personnel.Located at majestic Powescourt Gardens one of the finest formal gardens in Europe.  Pefect for a wedding or corporate event or anyone seeking some rest and solace in beautiful countryside outside Dublin.,5,2013,05,25
217,Incredible experience and stay!,"My husband and I stayed at the Ritz in Enniskerry. The Hotel was incredible, the pool was out of this world, the food was amazing! We loved everything about it, it was true luxury! No complaints or issues at all not sure how there could be, I felt like royalty staying there.",5,2013,05,24
217,A Place to get Away,"This Ritz must be one of the Jems of the Ritz Carlton, The grounds the views and the location is perfect.  The hotel staff form check in to housekeeping keeps this a very well run hotel.  The spa and pool was very relaxing and warm. Had a early flight in and the hotel accommodated us with a very beautiful room . This a is very special place to stay when visiting Ireland.",5,2013,05,24
217,Posh but Unpretentious,"The Ritz-Carlton Powerscourt is a lovely, elegant hotel in the Wicklow Mountains of Ireland. The setting is secluded, quiet and perfect for a special get away. The rooms are the most luxurious I have ever encountered; electronic controls for draperies, lighting, etc. The bed was wonderful... so comfortable.  The bathroom had a large soaking tub, separate shower, a television inside the mirror for viewing from the tub.  The dressing room was fitted with his and her closets. The terrace overlooked the beautiful grounds... so nice to enjoy morning coffee or tea. I had to pinch myself to be sure the experience was real.  The stay was compliments of Marriotts Rewards Program so certainly the price was right!
Service was excellent, friendly and helpful.  Powerscourt Gardens a short walk away. 
The only disappointment was the meal at Gordon Ramsey Restaurant; the food seemed to miss the mark.  It was midweek so perhaps not in top form.  
All in all the stay was fabulous and when returning to Ireland again I would gratefully visit Ritz-Carlton Powerscourt in a heartbeat.",5,2013,05,23
217,Amazing in Every Respect,"The Ritz Carlton is a perfect place to stay for weary, jet-lagged travelers looking for a place near Dublin. We arrived after a 12 hour flight from California and found it to be a short drive (30-45 mins) from the Dublin airport. The hotel is spectacular and next to the Powerscourt Gardens and golf course. The staff is excellent and every detail and amenity is provided. Free bike rentals, walking trails, gold carts with wool blankets, scones in the room for mid-afternoon tea, etc.  The restaurant on-site is owned by Gordon Ramsay. The rooms are very large with a huge bathroom and amazing shower.  the beds are the most comfortable of any hotel in Ireland (in our experience). This is one of the finest hotels we've had the pleasure to stay in. This hotel deserves six stars.",5,2013,05,22
217,"Great view, excellent hotel","The hotel is out in the gorgeous countryside. We arrived early, almost 6 hours early for check-in. Our flight landed in the am from the US . The hotel staffs were awesome, and were able to accommodate us. The concierge Trish, was extremely helpful. We had emailed that we wanted a tee time on our arrival day. She was able to get us one. Trish also assisted us with information on how to take the public transport into Dublin. We also booked a tour with her assistance to tour the Wicklow mountains. 
The Gordon Ramsay restaurant was exceptional. The service and the food was so good we plan to eat there again.

The hotel is a bit outside of Dublin, the countryside is beautiful. A taxi to the train station will take a few minutes to get to the hotel. The taxi drivers are very conscientious about being timely. It is amazing how quick they are able to arrive. We didn't have a car and didn't have a problem.",5,2013,05,20
217,Outstanding,My husband and I were here four nights for business and pleasure. Wonderful customer service. Great food. Hate to leave. Beautiful view of sugar loaf mountain. Great walking trails. Never had a problem getting shuttled here and there. I would recommend this hotel to anyone. Hot tub was marvelous. Had a manicure and loved the service,5,2013,05,20
217,"""Fantastic Experience""","Just returned from an overnight stay at The Ritz!!!! WOW!!!.   It was amazing. We were upgraded to a Superior Room when we checked in which was a great surprise.  The room was just beautiful from top to bottom. We had a balcony overlooking the gardens which I didn't mind it had still a lovely view. We had dinner in Gordon Ramsey's restaurant which was an experience of it's own.  The service was fabulous everywhere you went the staff are out there to look after you from check-in until check-out.  The Spa is not to be missed  so relaxing and chilled out area, best to go after 6pm as it's quiet then and you can get a great swim.  Breakfast was great with lot's of option's to choose from. A really relaxing break.  Will be back at this Hotel again and again.",5,2013,05,12
217,Elegant Country Stay,"Like other reviewers have said, the exterior design of this hotel is not so attractive or that appropriate for the location but once you look past the building, the rest is near perfection.

We stayed in a mountain view suite which we really enjoyed.  A long entry hall passed a powder room and lead into a living room/dining room combination.  There was a sitting area for four, a work desk that faced out to the covered terrace and mountain view, and a dining table for three with a chandelier above.  To our surprise there was also a large galley kitchen.  We took advantage of the full fridge, no freezer, to store our own bottle of wine.  The only complaint about the room was that there was a wall with no pictures and four built-in book shelves that lacked almost any items on them, giving this area a bare, nobody lives here, look.  French doors lead into the bedroom which also had a door out to the covered terrace.  A special feature of our suite was a large wardrobe room with four separate well lit closets with enough storage space to make even the most jaded traveler happy.  And finally the very spacious white marble bathroom was pure luxury.  The look and feel of the suite was regal elegance to a high standard without being over the top or uncomfortable.  You might not feel like a king or queen, but maybe a prince or princess.

The rest of the hotel is also very posh and elegant but we felt some of the common spaces looked a little bland, perhaps too much wood paneling could be the cause.  We had breakfast each morning in the Gordon Ramsay restaurant.  It was buffet style with an omelet chef on the weekend only.  Overall it was very nice.  We also had a meal in McGills which is a nice more upscale version of the classic Irish pub.

The spa level of the hotel is very spacious, with a sleek modern look.  We did not have a treatment, but we did use the pool and hot tub.  The pool is large and set in a windowless dark and moody room.  A very dreamy and relaxing environment has been created, but for a person like myself who likes to swim laps, the space was a not very motivating.  The gym was one of the best we have seen in a long time.  Large with good lighting, lots of equipment for a full workout, and located in a room overlooking the grounds and mountain.    

We used this location as a base to explore several sites outside of Dublin including Powerscourt which is an easy less than ten minute walk away.  This location served us well for this purpose.  The nearby town of Enniskerry is small and cute with a few restaurants to offer you nice options away from the hotel.      

It should be noted that only a small section of rooms on the backside of the hotel truly have a good view of Sugar Loaf Mountain.  Most rooms of the other side of the hotel do not really have nice views.  These rooms overlook other parts of the building or the parking lot with forest views in the distance.    

A rare Ritz treat that never seems to be found in their American hotels is complementary wi-fi, self-parking, and ice machines on each floor. 

With a beautiful setting, royal rooms, and great activities, this hotel is the perfect place to enjoy the nearby Dublin countryside in true luxury and avoid a city stay if you so desire.",5,2013,05,11
217,Fabulous but expensive,"Rooms are amazing but in fairness you do pay for it, restaurant lovely, Gordon's restaurant great too, fab service, I just chose the wrong thing.  Didn't bring our kids but very family friendly, would definitely bring the kids next time.  The beds are so comfortable I wanted to stay in bed all day!!!",5,2013,05,09
217,"Wonderful hotel, rooms, staff","Our six night stay in a suite facing Sugarloaf Mountain was outstanding.  The entire staff was so helpful and friendly making our visit all the more special.  Enjoyed the spa, Sugarloaf  Restaurant, Gordon Ramseys.  Everything was as nice as it could be.  Was hard to leave.
Thanks for a great welcome to Ireland. Always enjoyed to returning to our countryside retreat after a day of sightseeing",5,2013,05,07
217,Beautiful Hotel in Enniskerry,"Our family of four (2 adults and 2 children ages 8 and 10) had a beautiful weekend at the Ritz.  The pub was our children's favorite, with delicious fish and chips and a dessert menu that kept us coming back for more.  Our room was very roomy- it had a living area and a closet are that could easily have been another bedroom.  The bathroom was heavenly.  Breakfast was beautiful ranging from made to order eggs in any style (eggs' benedict/florentine, etc.), made to order pancakes/waffles/french toast- all excellent.  Smoked salmon with a variety of mustards and local sausages were a plus. The gym was very well stocked with a Concept 2 rower as well as a rack for barbell lifting as well as free weights and a separate room for stretching.  The hotel's spa looked very enticing, and although we did not use the spa facilities since we were on the go to the nearby sites- it looked like it was a vacation in and of itself.  The hotel's location is close to Glendalough, Avoca, and the Powercourt Castle.  The concierge service was excellent- he provided us with maps, printed out directions and background information on the nearby sights given our time in the area.  The hotel is fabulous whether you never leave the hotel or as a base to visit the local sights.  We are big fans.  The fresh chocolate chip cookies as a welcome present in our room were a sure hit and will keep us coming back for more.",5,2013,05,07
217,If you want to be so pampered you forget you're a person...,"Seriously. If you want to be pampered so much that you forget you're a person, this is your place. Spot on. Everything is done for you, which can be nice. The rooms are ""state of the art""-- everything's controlled by touch screen. The beds are all feather beds. The bathroom was gorgeous and also ""state of the art""-- there was a TV in the mirror and phone next to the toilet. But there was a nice bath and a rainforest shower (with a detachable, regular shower head too).

It's a 5-minute amble from the Powerscourt House and Gardens. There are 2 golf courses, I believe. The concierge was super helpful-- and a little bit more human. My only complaint was that the concierge wasn't available until 9.

I will add that this place felt very, very American. I still can't decide if that's a good thing or a bad thing. I mean, if that's what you want --an Americanized oasis as a home-base for little day trips around the Irish countryside-- then perfect. It just felt a little odd to me. Like, I couldn't blink without 4 waiters setting upon me to be helpful. (Someone just showed up midway through the evening at our door to offer us water.) It is also quite stiff and formal, but everyone is eager to help.

The view was absolutely gorgeous! The amenities were great. The food options were great; we loved afternoon tea in the Sugarloaf Lounge with the beautiful view and the Gordon Ramsey Restaurant. The Continental Breakfast was also awesome-- parfaits in martini glasses, selections of poached fruits, scones, cheeses and cold cuts along with the fixings for an Irish breakfast, if that's what you're in to. The spa/pool/hammam looked amazing although I wasn't there long enough to try them out.",5,2013,05,01
217,Superb,"Really enjoyed our stay at the Ritz. The staff are extremely helpful, the surroundings are lovely and the food is amazing. Particularly enjoyed our taster menu at the Gordon Ramsay restaurant the waiters here are particularly good at their job. It is expensive but better stay one night somewhere so good than two nights elsewhere that fails to meet expectations.",5,2013,04,29
217,5 STAR VEGAS STYLE LUXURY,"If you like this review and find the information or photos helpful, do please click the “Found It Helpful” link as I tried to find out and show what I would want to see and know about in a review.
Feel free to ask me any questions about your stay. 
At last, I’ve finally found a 5 star, American style, Vegas type hotel in Ireland. And what a find!
I had a choice of staying at the Four Seasons or the Merrion but plumped for the Ritz-Carlton at Enniskerry as I’d been wanting to try this hotel for a long time.  
You drive through the picturesque but cramped Enniskerry village and then into the Powerscourt Estate, but instead of driving to the main house, you take a left into the hotel grounds.
When we went, the hotel seemed to be only half-full, or half-empty depending on your viewpoint.  There were plenty of parking spaces available but if they are full, there is also an underground car park.
This is the first hotel that I’ve seen outside Vegas that has a large canopy outside the main entrance at the driveway.  The lobby is large and beautiful.  Andrew at check-in was very nice and polite and professional.  I had requested a very quiet suite and he said that they had made sure of this and also given us the best suite available.  I had booked a Classic Suite for €270 room only, or €300 with breakfast for 2.  We were then walked up to your suite by a Polish? Chap, who told us about the hotel and showed us the room.  I like when hotels do this as you can view the room and tell them if you hate it or not.  It’s a mark of a good hotel if you are walked to your room.  After he had explained all the features and options, he was gone, no hanging about for a tip. How refreshing!
There are plenty of classic suites available throughout the hotel; in fact, probably the majority of rooms on both wings are classic suites.  But this one was a bit better than usual in that first of all, it was at the very end of the wing, the end of the corridor, which was a bonus for peace and quiet (which I yearn for and will pay a premium for). The room also had a lovely view of the mountains and had a large terrace with chairs, a table and sun loungers.  It’s a rarity to be able to use sun loungers in Ireland, but it’s good to have the option.
I had wondered what size the suite would be on booking as some hotels can stick a table and chairs in the room and call it a suite but this was huge!  Possibly the biggest suite I’ve ever stayed in and it was certainly the best.  For €300, you could be stuck in a small, dated room even in 5 star hotels, and much worse in 4 star and lower, but this suite was luxurious, sumptuous and stunning.  A long hallway in the room ensured quiet and that any corridor noise would not be heard.  The FIRST bathroom was here, all beautiful grey marble with silver finishings and a wonderful heated floor.  
Then we were into the sitting room with a large 32” flat screen TV, a large coffee table with very comfortable chairs and a large sofa.  Then we were into the dining area with a beautiful dining table that seated four people on gorgeous, gold finished chairs underneath a sumptuous chandelier.  Then it was into the separate bedroom area.  Through sliding doors, the bed was huge and very comfortable.  In the bedroom, was the second, main bathroom.  Again, in beautiful marble, with his n hers sinks, a large bath and separate shower and toilets.  Both bathrooms were fabulous, so my wife could have the big one to herself and I had the other one.  Perfect.  There was also even a separate changing room with absolute loads of wardrobe space and drawer space.  If you were staying for a while and had lots of clothes, this suite was perfect for you as I doubt you’d be able to fill all the space that has been provided for you.  There was also a second flat screen TV in the bedroom and a third TV in the bathroom, built into the mirror!  What luxury!  This is how they do things in the best hotels in Vegas and it’s something that has been missing in Ireland, until now.
There is a fridge I the room doubling as a mini bar.  Prices are usually mini bar prices but not extortionate.  Alternatively, bring your own supplies and put them in the fridge, it’s yours for the duration.  I knew the hotel was a Pepsi establishment, so we brought lots of Diet Coke and a bottle of Bolly.  There was a kettle and tea and coffee sachets.
With such a beautiful dining table yearning to be used, we ordered room service and the chap served us at the table.  This is the life!  The choice on the room service menu was quite limited and was the same menu as the Sugar Loaf restaurant with a few more sandwich choices added.  I feel that the menu should be updated and this did let the hotel down a bit.  We both had fish n chips which actually wasn’t great.  Over-battered finish and seemingly refried chips let the hotel down big style.  Revamp this menu and get it up to the standard as everything else!
Earlier, at lunch time we dined in the Sugar Loaf restaurant and ordered afternoon tea, and though a bit pricey at €35 each, we thought it was worth every penny and that it was probably the best afternoon tea we’ve had anywhere!  The cake stand arrived with tandoori chicken wraps which were delicious, salmon and prawn and roe on brown bread, roast beef with horseradish on beautifully soft brioche buns and a gorgeous egg mayonnaise sandwich with layers of cucumber on top which had been arranged and sliced to look like a slice of cake.  Stunning.
Small but perfectly sized plain and fruit scones with a selection of jams (apricot, strawberry, raspberry and marmalade), butter and cream.  The scones were so beautiful with the butter that I didn’t even bother with the cream, they were that good!  After you’ve had all that, the dessert chariot is wheeled over and you get to choose two cakes each from the selection.  I had a lemon meringue pie and a strawberry cheesecake, both excellent and my wife had a mango and passion fruit cake and a chocolate and blackberry macaron.  Everything was top class.  We took our time, read the papers, enjoyed our tea and took about two hours over it and no-one was in any rush to move us.  The staff were excellent and Peter, who looked after us refreshed our tea pots regularly, more than he had to and nothing was too much trouble for him.  In fact, what made this hotel and any hotel worthy of 5 stars is the quality of the staff and the service.  Everyone who passed us smiled and greeted us and was extremely helpful and that’s not something we’ve experienced in Ireland before.  This was the service that you get in Monaco or Vegas!  So bravo to all the staff here.
The breakfast room service menu didn’t seem great and most of the selection were actually drinks, so we got up at 9am and went down to the Gordon Ramsay restaurant to see if the breakfast was any good.  I didn’t have high hopes as I think I must have read negative reviews, but the breakfast was excellent.  Again, possibly the best breakfast selection we’ve had!  See my photos for the selection available.  As we went in, we were warmly greeted and shown to our table.  The chap who was serving, Alberto, was excellent. Very helpful and smiley and you could see that he took a pride in his job and this man could get a job in any hotel anywhere.  There were juices and fresh fruits including my favourites, fresh pineapple and watermelon, no tinned fruit cocktail here!  Yoghurts, fresh fruit, cereals, boiled eggs, nuts, breakfast martinis of compote, yoghurt, toasted oats and berries, more types of Danish pastries than I’ve ever seen, breads, toasts, scones, hams, meats and cheeses and all the usual cooked stuff…sausages, bacon, puddings, scrambled eggs, mushrooms, potatoes.  You can also request the chef of whatever eggs you want and there’s another menu full of options that you pay extra for…waffles, pancakes, etc…   My wife had pancakes and bacon and maple syrup, all delicious!   Come down early if you want to dine in the Gordon Ramsay restaurant as many people were turned away.  The same breakfast fare is available in the Sugar Loaf lounge above, but it’s nice to have tried both restaurants.
Check-out was easy and it was the same very courteous Andrew who checked us in and out (and who also enrolled me in the Ritz-Carlton awards scheme).  So, the hotel was absolutely out of this world.  The staff were fantastic.  It was absolutely value for money.  The food was overall, excellent.  We stated for one night, I wish we could have stayed longer and we will definitely be back sooner rather than later.
Little bits I missed out…there were ample toiletries, lots of space in the bathrooms, pay per view movies, delicious cocktails in the lobby with nibbles, ice machine rooms (a la Vegas), walking trails, lcd control panels for the curtains, air con and lights throughout the suite, 5 panels by my count and even a handsome desk.",5,2013,04,29
217,Mountain View Suite,"Pros:
Beautiful location - plenty to do in the area in close proximity to the hotel
Splendid hotel - although in parts perhaps a bit ""cruise ship"" for me..thats just my taste though
Spa is beautiful - ESPA products - therapist one of the best i have had - excellent massage
Swimming Pool - go here when its quite to appreciate how amazing it looks
We had a Mountain View Suite - very spacious
Lots of activities nearby - make sure to visit Enniskerry Glendalough etc 
Staff very nice, not too overpowering, apart from the Bellboy who put his hand out for a tip !:D
We were happy with the value and got a free upgrade which was great- I love when hotels do that
Cons
Did not like the view of the trees behind the hotel. Looks like they just got a forklift and levelled a big section. It needs to be landscaped/graduated better to improve its looks.",5,2013,04,28
217,The best hotel I have ever stayed at!,"This is our last night in Ireland. We upgraded to a mountain view suite and this is a 10/10. Free wifi, complimentary shuttle to and from town from the Ritz. What can I say???  I can't say enough about this place. I am absolutely floored on how nice the hotel is.  Perfect!",5,2013,04,27
217,Not a wow!,Had a day visit to the hotel.  Location stunning plenty of walks  and had a great afternoon tea. Spa was my choice of spoils.... Excellent facilities as one would expect from a 5 star hotel... Staff friendly but treatments disappointing.  So wont rush back... But loved the location.... ,3,2013,04,27
217,Exceptional Experience,"We stayed for 7 nights and didn't want to leave! Absolutely beautifully appointed rooms, attentive and friendly staff ready & willing to tend to every request....large or small! Located on the Powerscourt Estate - the facade of Ritz is not impressive, but don't judge this book by its cover! Enter the beautifully appointed lobby replete with Swarovski laden chandeliers in the shape of hot air balloons, a multitude of stunning orchid floral arrangements and a stunning view of Sugarloaf Mountain...WOW! Enter the bedroom suite and WOW again! It's beautifully appointed with no amenity missed. Lovely decor, comfortable bed and bedding, a gorgeous marble bath with heated floor, spacious dressing room, comfortable living room, wifi and 2 flat screen televisions....whats not to love? This Ritz is set upon the most beautiful professionally groomed grounds in Ireland (my opinion). Be sure to explore, you wont be disappointed. I've no hesitation recommending this gorgeous 5 star hotel....it truly is a wonderful place to stay while visiting the beautiful country of Ireland.",5,2013,04,26
217,"Fantastic golf, gardens and views.","The settings of the hotel are just wonderful. Fantastic golf, gardens and views. The overall ambience is perfect for relaxing, dining and being pampered. I'd recommend the hotel and the golf, however the overall service at the pro shop could have been a little bit better, with a warmer welcome.",5,2013,04,26
217,Incredible looking hotel,"Fantastic rooms, although the view from mine was non-existent, but as I was only staying one night was not too bothered. Decent in room amenities. Service was friendly, polite and always willing to help. Biggest complaint was the pillows - awful - had to ask for firmer ones - took awhile to arrive but not that much better. Expected more here in terms of comfort. Second complaint, given this was the Ritz Carlton expected a better breakfast buffet than was on offer. Great views of the mountain and forests. A little far out from Dublin Airport (1 hour or about €100 taxi ride).",4,2013,04,23
217,"Great stay,child friendly","We stayed over easter for two nights.We stayed as party of two adults and one child. We found the hotel to be very child friendly, from the reception with kids own check in,to the super ritz kids playroom.The playroom was excellant and had several activities over easter with, cookie decorating,painting, arts and crafts and daily movie with popcorn provided. There was a very nice girl called chloe who worked there an made all the kids feel welcome.
We are Marriott gold elite card holders and to our delight we were upgraded to a suite overlooking sugar loaf mountain, they also provided a microwave and fridge. very handy if you have children.
Rooms are spacious and very comfortable with touch screen control panel for lights etc. We had a rollaway bed for our daughter  and separate seating area and work desk. There was free wifi in room as well. 
The food in sugar loaf restaruant was nice and as we had pre booked, so got a nice table overlooking the gardens. Drinks are very expensive, 4.50 euro for small soft drink/ tea etc. However we got a deal for the accomodation with food included which was good value. Breakfast was ate in Gordon Ramseys restaurant, there was a good selection  of hot and cold items with plenty of fresh fruit and homemade bread and pastries.
We enjoyed our stay and would not hestitate to return. A very good hotel for families.",5,2013,04,22
217,Perfection!,"My husband and I spent one night last August at the end of our trip to Ireland in this beautiful hotel.  It was our favorite place after 10 days in the country. We felt cheated and decided to book another trip to Ireland to stay in this hotel, celebrate our wedding anniversary and to explore the east coast.  We returned this April. This time we stayed in a suite for six nights. The rooms are so beautiful and comfortable. They are perfectly appointed with everything a traveler needs to feel special and pampered. The staff is outstanding, from the reception desk to the housekeeping staff, everyone was so warm and accommodating. We quickly fell into a routine walking everyday either into charming Enniskerry or to the Powerscourt Estate for an afternoon tea and scones overlooking the gardens. The concierge staff was incredible, helping us not only with our trip to Dublin on the DART but helping us plan a day trip to Belfast. I can't remember when we have enjoyed a vacation more than the one we have spent at this Ritz. I would easily go back a third time!",5,2013,04,20
217,Absolute Luxury,"The hotel is not very striking as you drive in, however, as soon as you step in the door you receive a very warm welcome and the decor is stunning.

We booked a package that was €330 for 1 night B&B and included a 3 course meal in the Sugar Loaf lounge. The option we should have booked was the one for €320 that was B&B with €70 credit to spend in the hotel as we did have a 3 course lunch in the Gordon Ramsay restaurant for €33 per head and that meal was far superior to the Sugar Loaf dinner.

We booked a standard room, but there is nothing standard about it. It is the same as a suite in many hotels. The decor is beautiful, the beds are very comfortable and the bathroom is very large.

The staff at the hotel are very helpful and extremely friendly. The grounds are stunning and if you are tempted to stay here, do not hesitate to book as it is worth every cent.",5,2013,04,19
217,Relaxing and beautiful,"We stayed for six nights at this amazing hotel. We stayed in a suite that had everything we needed and more. The bathroom was the nicest I have ever seen at a hotel, it's to bad the toiletries are poor quality! I was worried about the distance to Dublin, but the hotel provided transportation into town, and it was easy to take the bus into Dublin. We spent one day checking out the local area and going to the spa, which was very nice. The powerscourt gardens, a short walk away, and very pretty. If I were to go back to ireland, I would definitely stay here again!",5,2013,04,16
217,Beautiful Ireland,"This hotel is stunning. The service and the suites are exceptional. We were looked after from being collected from the airport to departure. Nothing is too much trouble and the staff were all charming,accommodating and professional.",5,2013,04,16
217,Not what expected from a 5 star property,"Stayed at the Ritz Carlton for 2 days. The hotel itself is beautiful and also the setting is very nice. Personal is very friendly. Upon arrival there was actually noone to take the luggage. Rooms are very spacious and nice, not enough light though. I needed to charge my phone and found a plug behind the side table by the bed. I found not only the pkug but also some rubbish which must have bedn there for some time. It was finally removed the next day as I left the table so they could see it. Food in the hotel is ok but nothing special. At the breakfast it approx. 30 minutes to get a cup of coffee. They were busy with other things and looking into different directions. Late checkout meant an extension of only 1 hour from noon to 1pm. At the last day I left the ""do not disturb"" on. Coming back to the room, I found someone must have been in the room as the windows were open and there was a purple laundry bag on the table etc. What is the point of do not disturb??
Basically this is not what you expect from a Ritz Carlton nor from a 5 star property.
Disappointed!",3,2013,04,15
217,From a Travel Writer - An Exceptional Hotel,"The Ritz-Carlton on Powerscourt Estate in the village of Enniskerry is a magnificent resort set on the most picturesque plot of land imaginable. I will briefly touch on what wonders lie ahead of you should you choose to visit, but know that this is just a prologue. There are more wonderful things to see, do, discover and experience here than you will have time for, unless you plan to be here a long while.

My husband and I chose Ireland for our wedding anniversary trip. In January, the plane fares are almost reasonable from the U.S. We began our tour in Dublin, then drove across the island to Cong, then to Waterford to take a crystal factory tour and on to Enniskerry just to see The Ritz-Carlton. We spent one night there, then caught a plane home. This hotel should have been our first stop. Even in the dark of early evening, the estate was mesmerizing. A tiny winding road lead to the great gates and on to the main building. The hotel lobby was bedazzled with gilded hot air balloon chandeliers, expansive spaces, a huge picture window at one end and cascading staircases.

The bellman whisked us off to our room as we had reservations at the main restaurant, Gordon Ramsay, in just a half hour’s time. We used up most of that time admiring the room instead of getting ready. The suite was spectacular! Its two bathrooms, master bedroom, small changing area, large balcony and sitting room with fireplace were elegantly appointed and exceptionally comfortable. The touch-pad controls in the entry and bedroom controlled the drapes, lighting and other features. The beautiful bathroom had a separate tub and shower (I used both). It was heaven to soak in the tub and watch the in-mirror TV. Only in Ireland have I seen make-up vanities in every hotel. The U.S. needs to take a cue from hospitality in Ireland – every need is anticipated.

At Gordon Ramsay, David and I were shown to our table…in the kitchen. As an anniversary surprise, we had reservations at the Chef’s Table, where we could talk to the chefs and watch them prepare our meal. Our tasting menu was so delectable we both ate an overabundance and tried new cuisine like stuffed duck neck (delicious) and sorbet in an edible cup. The restaurant staff came from several European countries. Each spoke impeccable English and was both friendly and knowledgeable. Our server was from Portugal and gave us an incredible evening that we won’t forget.

After a night in the (so very) soft bed, we tiptoed down to the spa to see the famous pool. The water appears dark and is lit by delicate Swarovski crystal lights in the pool’s floor. It gives the appearance of a reverse galaxy – the stars are below instead of above. Swimming here is magical.

All too soon it was time to go. We hadn’t been able to explore the village or walk on the 1,000-acre Powerscourt estate. The gardens feature a fish pond, Italian terraces, walled garden and a Japanese garden. Guests can go horseback riding, play croquet, shoot, be an archer for a day and a lot more. ESPA (a well-known name) has 20 treatment rooms and a thermal suite. Sigh. Next time. 

My Recommendation:

Had I known this hotel/estate would turn out to be one of my favorite hotels in the world, I would have planned for a week in this one spot. Don’t make my same mistake – book your room and stay for a while.",5,2013,04,15
217,Everything was just perfect,"Everything you would expect from a Ritz-Carlton hotel. This hotel is just beautiful along with amazing staff and food.

The staff really are truly amazing - they're so incredibly friendly and just cannot do enough to help you. You really are being looked after here!

Bedrooms are just gorgeous, very spacious with possibly the most comfortable bed I have ever slept in!

The food is great, we didn't dine at the Gordon Ramsay restaurant so I can't comment on that but having breakfast in te Sugar Loaf Lounge overlooking Sugar Loaf mountain was lovely. The quality and choice of breakfast was great too. Dinner at Sugar Loaf was lovely too and I would definitely recommend this if you're looking for a nice, relaxed and intimate atmosphere. We also had drinks and bar food at McGills which was also fantastic, try the chicken wings! (Dinner menu at both Sugar Loaf and McGills are pretty much identical from what I had noticed)

Spa is also lovely. The crystal lit pool creates a nice, calming atmosphere and the Hammam Suite is definitely worth a visit. Swimming pools and Hammam Suite are complimentary for residential guests.

Location wise, the Ritz Powerscourt is in te peaceful village of Enniskerry. It's about a 20-25 minute walk from Enniskerry village to the hotel but if you call the hotel, they will come and pick you up (2 minute drive).

Dublin is about a half hour drive from the hotel with the hotel having a taxi rate of 40€ one way should you wish to visit the city centre. Alternatively, you can buy a 15€ 3 day bus pass from Dublin airport and this will take you between Dublin & Enniskerry (approx 1 hour bus journey)

Would definitely come back here again!",5,2013,04,15
217,"Great hotel, friendly staff, fantastic pool and spa","Stayed here at the end of a week's visit to Ireland, this hotel is in a stunning location just 1 hour from Dublin, yes it is expensive but worth every cent. The pool, spa and rooms are fantastic as are all of the staff who make you feel like you are the only guest. The restaurants are very good, with a wide choice. I would recommend a visit to the local village, there is a great wine shop called The parting glass where you can pick up very reasonably priced wine and champaign. Powerscourt house, gardens and river walk give plenty to do.",5,2013,04,13
217,Afternoon Tea,"First time at Ritz Carlton, had a spot of trouble finding it. Perhaps it was just the rain, but I could not see any helpful signage to direct patrons. Anyway got there in the end and was in awe of the place from the moment I laid eyes on it. Beautiful location but the hotel itself was just stunning.
Because of the rain I decided to park in the underground car park. Once there I could not see one exit sign to get me into the hotel. I wandered out into the rain and finally made my way into the hotel, totally lost with no sense of where the foyer was, to meet my friends. A few signs here and there would not go astray Ritz-Carlton.

 After all that, we had a gorgeous afternoon tea in the Sugar Loaf Lounge with a scrumptious array of sandwiches and cakes not to mention the lovely teas. Our waiters were very helpful, with a special mention going to Victor.

Ideal for special occasions, will definitely go back again for another treat.",4,2013,04,12
217,Superb,"Stayed here for one night as a special treat from our children. This was our first time here and it did not disappoint. Absolutely beautiful hotel with stunning views. From the moment you enter the hotel you are made to feel special by all of the staff and that continued throughout our stay. 
We were lucky enough to be staying in the mountainview suite which was absolutely beautiful, This room had a very large balcony with table and chairs and sun loungers and beautiful views. Would be lovely to sit out in the summertime.
That night we ate in the gordon ramsay restaurant and I can honestly say it was one of the nicest meals I have ever had , and again the staff were brilliant, very friendly.
To finish off a wonderful stay we had a few drinks in  McGills bar and again friendly smiling staff. Breakfast next morning was very varied and to a very high standard with the same attentive service from the staff here as well.
All in all we had a wonderful stay and I cant wait to go back.",5,2013,04,11
217,IRELAND VACATION @ THE RITZ-CARLTON,"I was recently a past guest with my friend @ the Ritz-Carlton Powerscourt 3/2013. Our trip was AMAZING and the hotel was absolutely BEAUTIFUL! It is located in the Powerscourt Gardens in Wicklow Co and known to be one of the most beautiful gardens in the world! The hotel was breathtakingly beautiful and the staff  was friendly, helpful and warm. Everyone had a smile on their face and willing to go out of their way to please you. Robert, the concierge was the most helpful man in all of Ireland!! He was sure to help plan our daily excursions and give us advice on where to go and what to do. The sweet Hungarian bellhop was very helpful as well! He was so kind to help us with anything we needed and would pick us up from the local shops and pubs with a smile! I frequent spas often, and our spa service was one of the best I've ever had! The downstairs pub, Mcgills also had one of the best Irish Music bands we had heard. Housekeeping was amazing as well! Our rooms were spotless! We couldn't of enjoyed our experience any more than we did! Everything was exceptional! I will be staying @ the Ritz on my next trip to beautiful Ireland!",5,2013,04,09
217,"Beautiful Hotel, Amazing Stay","We recently stayed in the absolutely beautiful Ritz Carlton in Enniskerry on several occasions. We have regularly eaten here but never stayed. This hotel is absolute luxury. We  enjoyed every minute of our stays. The minute you walk in the door you are greeted with excellent customer service and a really high level of attention to detail from the staff. 

The rooms are of a really high standard, as you would expect from a hotel of this quality. There was nothing to disappoint. The setting of the hotel is really beautiful, with the backdrop of the Sugarloaf Mountain. The exterior of the hotel is not as beautiful as the interior but don't let that put you off, once inside you will enjoy every minute of your stay. 

The spa is excellent, I enjoyed  a customised facial with one of the best beauticians I have ever met, she really took the time to advise. The spa setting is stunning too with a beautiful swimming pool and facilities. Make time to enjoy the relaxation room after your treatment which is wonderful.

We had a small problem in our room and mentioned it to Benoit, one of the managers who was absolutely excellent and really made sure to look after us and fix the problem immediately, it was very impressive how he dealt with us.

I would advise that you make sure to book a table in the Sugarloaf restaurant if you are planning afternoon tea or a glass of wine, it gets very busy and can often be booked and you want to make sure you have one of the window tables overlooking the Sugarloaf.

The Gordon Ramsay Restaurant is very nice but I felt that the Sugarloaf restaurant was also a really nice option for dinner too, it has less choice on the menu but the food is very good and it is lovely at night.

The bar in the hotel beside the Gordon Ramsay restaurant is great too, lovely atmosphere and is set as a typical old fashioned Irish bar and they have had live Irish music which is good fun

Take a walk around the ground and if your up to it, hire one of their bikes and enjoy a cycle around the lovely grounds and make sure to visit Powerscourt Gardens and House - on the same grounds",5,2013,04,08
217,Just sublime,We have stayed here a number of times and it never disappoints. It is a very special treat to ourselves and we don't really want to share it! It is very worthwhile to upgrade to a suite. The hotel has everything for 24 hours of total bliss. Faultless. I love it and can't wait to go back! ,5,2013,04,08
217,"Beautiful Hotel, beautiful restaurant. A real 6* but just one small gripe...","Since the time last November when I booked a relative into this hotel I was dying to get an opportunity to stay there. Then my wife suggested this as a birthday present so, of course, I jumped at the chance. It's in a beautiful location, discreetly situated with a sweep of land to the Sugar Loaf mountain (Wicklow not Brazil!) and, unlike many hotels which claim a certain category of stars, especially in Ireland, it made sense (although a 5* would fit it). I liked the ambience and from the time we arrived we felt like valued customers. I would recommend afternoon tea in the Sugar Loaf Lounge and dinner in the restaurant was a lot less costly than it was a few years back. Delicious too. The spa was very good but here's where the single gripe about the stay comes in; I like a sauna and they generally come as standard with a hotel spa area. This spa area had a pool and a Hammam with Himalaya salt but the latter is hot steam and I prefer a dry heat sauna. I inquired as to where the sauna was, thinking I’d just overlooked it but no, there was one, separately located, but it cost another €25. This made no sense at all. If the Hammam was chargeable I could understand but a bog standard sauna. Very odd and just the one fly in the otherwise flawless ointment.",4,2013,04,08
217,A Real Treat,"From check in to departure... the whole experience was wonderful. Our room was beautiful and spacious.. the bed was amazing... the bathroom was fantantic with a TV in the mirror .. the spa area was beautiful... I could go on and on about this hotel... it is expensive but you will not be disappointed. 
And the one thing I really loved about our stay was that we could not hear any other residents coming and going while we were in our room which meant our night sleep was not interrupted by any noises in the hotel and we slept right through the night.",5,2013,04,08
217,Great stay in lovely location,"The staff were attentive and friendly. The Spa facilities were very good. It was Easter break so there were lots of children making the pool area and lounge area very busy and noisy. The Gordon Ramsay restaurant was very good. Food in the bar was not great, expected better standard. Rooms were spacious and comfortable. Breakfast was very good with lots of healthy options available.",4,2013,04,07
217,A MUST....,"OMG, what a venue and what a wonderful luxury hotel.  Please do yourself a favor and STAY here. You will not regret it. Excellent value, a SIX star hotel (only 2 six star hotels in the WORLD)--
I will return, and I will bring all my friends and family here.  Go to the Gordon Ramsay restaurant in the hotel. We had two rooms for our family of 4. They upgraded us and gave us suites! So worth it....",5,2013,04,07
217,Service disappointing,"Our group of 4 ladies recently visiting the Ritz on a groupon deal March 2013.  The hotel and ground itself is absolutely beautiful.  The room was spacious, clean, and the beds were absolutely comfortable.  The housekeeping staff were attentive.  However, it was pointed out three times to our group when asking for directions or tourist information, that we were a groupon group.  Why???? The front desk was not very helpful and I agree with some of the other reviews, that we were not treated the same as other people who were paying full price.  Also, we went to the pool which was spectacular every night.  However,while there, we observed a male employee who removed dirty towels from the chairs, but did not change the wet covers, but just straightened them...Moist towels equal bacteria...Not a standard of a 5 star hotel.  In addition, the ladies at the desk of the spa were not friendly, and downright rude when letting everyone know that the pool would be closing in 15 minutes.  They made us feel that they did not want to be there or be of service...Trust me, our group was very low maintenance...we were completely self sufficient, and the staff of the spa were still rude.  I definitely had a goal of having a facial, but did not feel if would be worth the money, because it really is about friendly service.  Because we did not feel welcomed to eat in the dining area, we went to Mcgills...what a wonderful surprise.  It was homey, friendly, quaint, and Sean and Ross were superb.  We had so much fun with that group, that as tired as we were after touring all day, we made an effort to visit them, because the food, service and friendliness were great.  Maybe the front desk should take a lesson from them.  They did everything they could to make our stay fantastic...",3,2013,04,05
217,Very relaxing,"Stayed here in December and enjoyed the quality and food yet again. Got an upgrade to a suite which was lovely. Make sure to book dinner in advance as it was a struggle to get a table but we were accommodated eventually!
Lovely walks and the area very relaxing and Avoca shops perfect to enjoy.",5,2013,04,05
217,The Ritz.,"This Ritz was just OK. Although I was there on a GroupOn ticket, I still don't think that I got the same service that someone paying full price would have gotten. I had to ask 4 times for a sheet for the bed. They use duvet's there so there is no sheet between the duvet and you. The duvet only can get very warm during the night.  I also used up the tissue in the dispenser. The room was cleaned and the tissue was still empty. I complained to the front desk and the tissue dispenser remained empty for the duration of my stay. Not exactly what I would call a ""top-notch Ritz service"".",2,2013,04,04
217,Beyond expectations,"This was a part of a Groupon trip to Ireland so my expectations were low.  The hotel was wonderful and so were the services.  The concierge (Robbie) was not very helpful, he answered the questions you asked, but didn't offer any suggestions.  We didn't eat there but did have a drink at the bar which was 11 Euros for a malibu and coke!  Was was great and very clean hotel.",5,2013,04,04
217,Enjoyable hotel.,"My bride of 39 years and I stayed here for a week beginning 3/19/13. We found the staff to be most helpful and accommodating. The hotel and grounds are beautiful. Our room was large and had all the bells and whistles we needed. (One negative was a too soft mattress with valleys in it. I didn't complain so that's on me.) We found the hotel far enough away to suit our tastes from the big cities, but close enough to drive to most anywhere except west coast. That's a 3.5 hour hike. We enjoyed McGills pub numerous times (Kamilla) and the Breakfast area with a stunning view where we ate breakfast 7 days in a row. (Hats off to Sebastion for taking care of all our needs at breakfast. He is a true professional.) We got a great price for this hotel and do not regret our staying. Matter of fact, we look forward to returning.",4,2013,04,02
217,5 Star Sunday brunch  - best forgotten!,"I am familiar with this area of Ireland and know my way around many of the hotels and restaurants. This was my first and last  visit to the Ritz-Carlton!
 This hotel was much heralded in the press and is a product of the Celtic Tiger era ( up to 2009) as the ultimate in luxury, featuring a Gordon Ramsay restaurant. The bloom has now gone off it and the hotel is now in receivership and I can see why. It is located in the  beautiful Powercourt House estate and disfigures it. The car park  lighting and reception structures  at the rear are reminiscent of 1950s railway station design. The interior is  a mish mash of themes and design, seemingly undecided as to what it is trying to achieve and lots of dark wood gives a cold, gloomy feel. The front of the hotel is a much more elegant design with nice views towards Sugarloaf mountain and the Wicklow countryside (marred by the siting of a 20-30 foot metallic sculpture of a paper dart crashed into the ground beside a small wooded area!)
 The clientele on Easter Sunday were mainly visitors ( a number of  whom I talked with) from Northern Ireland on their Easter Break and just in from a morning's touring, golfing or walking in the Powerscourt estate proper with a healthy appetite. 
My wife and I ordered brunch  - (Full Irish breakfast and a light salad with coffee) after a short wait ( plenty of staff but not sure what they were doing).  The coffee arrived after 10 minutes  which gave me time to look around and observe that  most furniture below knee level had lots of dust  residue which looked to be weeks old or more. The food arrived after another 10 minutes and was rather sparse. My wife had to ask for some toast as none was provided. It arrived after some time and was wafer-thin dried out bread. That might do with pate in a French restaurant  but not as a hearty meal in freezing weather.  The cost in total was €50 for around €6 worth of food served slowly. Needless to say, we didn't stay to savour more 5 star service.

My feeling is that service and experiences may be very varied here. Rave reviews from American tourists may be caught up in the moment and some of the restaurant meals might be very good but my own experience and comments from those I talked to suggest disappointment. It may have been good for a while but now is expensive and pretentious. 

I have discovered a much better brunch experience less than half a mile away in the village of Enniskerry at Kennedy's country kitchen. No pretentions, prompt service, beautiful fresly cooked food on hot plates with lovely selection of oven-fresh breads and cakes and at a reasonable price.  A few doors up from that is Poppy's Cafe (tiny) which also has nice country cooking.  For visitors to the area looking for good quality food and a nice view,in what was the Slazenger mansion, they might like the (self-service) resataurant in Powerscourt House itself, only a few hundred yards from the Ritz-Carlton but be warned, it is popular and gets busy at week-ends.",2,2013,04,02
217,Excellent with a few disappointments,"My husband and I (and our dog!) stayed in the Ritz-Carlton Powerscourt very recently (30/03/13) for one night. We booked the Ramsey Experience Package as a treat for my husband's 40th birthday. We booked the package through the hotel itself and I was very pleased with the deal we got. 
When we arrived at the hotel we were greeted very warmly by one of the reception staff and there was no wait for check in either even though we arrived at 1pm and officially check in is not untill 3pm. When no ""bell hops"" were available the receptionist showed us up to our room. She was very apologetic about this and the fact that she would not be able to show us all the touch screen operator in our room would do! We told her not to worry and that we'd figure it out.
When we got to the room there was an extra roll out bed in the room instead of the dog bed and she said she would get someone up to rectify it straight away. She did. We pretty much dropped our bags and by the time we were ready to go out for a wander there was someone at the door ready to take the bed out and replace it with the dog bed.
We got back to the room around 5pm and found a lovely bed for the dog and a water/food bowl. 

There was also a little selection of chocolates waiting to wish my husband a happy birthday - a very nice touch. The room itself was gorgeous. Classically styled without being old fashioned. Very spacious (we had booked a superior) with a walk in wardrode area, a seating area, a desk, a balcony and a beautiful bathroom, the mirror had a very cool feature - a tv! The bed was also lovely and big and very very comfortable.

As we had booked the Ramsey Experience we were booked into the restaurant that night. The restaurant staff were absolutely excellent and every need was catered for and anticipated. We were offered a glass of sparkling wine at the beginning of the meal as part of the package (a fact that is not mentioned on the website or one that I had overlooked!) which was lovely. We were then given our menus, I got a seperate vegetarian one when I enquired about veggie main course, and a choice of breads. Our waitress came back a number of times to offer more bread too so not a stingy ""one piece of bread and that's it"" kind of place. 
The food really was superb. Everything was delicious. The only fault I found with it was with my main course. I ordered gnocchi with chanterelle mushrooms as I LOVE chanterelles and I don't find them often! However when the dish arrived I noticed that instead of chanterelle there was chestnut mushrooms. A huge difference. I didn't say anything to the staff as it was still delicious but it was not what I ordered and I had not been informed that there were no chanterelles. I think they were hoping that it would not be noticed! Other than that the meal was perfect, but it did marr it.
That night we didn't sleep too well unfortunately. The air conditioning had made the air exceptionally dry, almost unbareably so. We did turn it off but it didn't help with the dryness and also the room got really warm! As there were no windows to open, just the balcony door, we had to turn the air-con back on in order to cool down.
The breakfast the next morning was excellent. Really delicious and a huge variety. Something for everyone. 
At check out I was disappointed to find that we were charged for a bottle of wine a friend of ours had ordered for the room as a surprise for us. While this was quickly corrected it was annoying and spoiled the present as we saw cost etc. 

All in all we had a lovely time at The Ritz but the experience was tempered by a few things.

Pros:
Beautiful hotel
Excellent staff
Delicious food - both at dinner and breakfast
Lovely welcoming touches to make stay special
Fantastic room
Bunnies and guinea pigs in large fenced off area in foyer for kids for Easter!!
Very dog friendly

Cons:
Substituted ingredients in dinner main course
Air very very dry in room
Incorrectly charged for gifted wine",4,2013,04,02
217,Fantastic from start to finish!,"We have just returned from our Easter break at the Ritz Carlton and from the moment we checked in we knew it was going to be amazing! 
The hotel itself is really impressive from the onset but it is staff that truly make this a five star property. The staff at check in gave us a complimentary upgrade to a fantastic larger room with separate living room and fabulous large bathroom. 
We were travelling with another couple and their disabled daughter and they were actually upgraded to a small suite with a kitchen area to make things easier for her. All complimentary! The staff went out of their way to accommodate their daughter and were so unbelievably helpful. On the first night in the hotel we had a cake in the suite for the little girls birthday, when the staff saw this at turn down service they came back with an Easter egg for her and a birthday card signed by the staff on our floor. It was so touching. This wasnt a one off as the second night they had cookies beautifully presented and more cake for the adults all beautifully laid out for us at the suites dining room table! Wonderful touch!
On this occasion we couldn't eat at Gordon Ramseys restaurant as it was fully booked but we did eat several times in the sugar loaf lounge and in mc gills. Both were lovely and the sugar loaf lounge is perfect for people watching. I didn't use the spa but my partner did for a massage and said it was amazing. 
Will definitely be returning and would highly recommend this hotel to anyone! ",5,2013,04,02
217,"Exceptional service , a great stay had by all","Spent three nights wonderful nights over Easter with friends, we wanted somewhere that we didn't have to leave for the whole weekend if we didn't want to. We weren't disappointed ,firstly the location is ideal in the grounds of the Powerscourt estate , you can stroll down to the Powerscourt house & tour the Gardens , have lunch in Avoca & there is a fine Garden centre beside it too. There is a River walk & the village of Enniskerry is a short stroll .On arrival in the hotel the rooms were not on the same floor as requested but that wasn't a problem & they made a few adjustments & we were given a room facing the sugar loaf mountains & a deluxe room across the hall over looking a wall garden, both rooms were tastefully decorated, the deluxe room had a larger walk in dressing room & a sitting room. In both rooms  the beds were very comfortable , Touch screen control of heating, lights, curtains etc. The Tv in the bathroom mirror was a nice addition as you could relax in the bath watching Tv!!. We got a deal of stay two nights & get a third free. It worked out at €260 each for three nights b&b which is great value for money. I have read various reviews about it being expensive but you get what you pay for. Drinks etc were on the pricey side, but when you out your out!! One criticism in relation to  The food - in the sugar loaf lounge was nice we had lunch on the Thursday but the menu didn't change so I think if you were staying more than two/three nights dining options would be  limited ,  we ate in Mc Gills Pub which was standard Pub fare , The  Gordon Ramsey restaurant was a little disappointing , the starters & desserts were fab but I had the Rib eye , a sirloin arrived first & was sent back , I had order rear & it was at best medium , to be fair everyone else enjoyed their dinner &  I didn't inform the server that the rib eye was over cooked as the rest of the table  had waited long enough. I am a fan of Ramsey's kitchen nightmare & I think to myself what he would say on the TV if he got the Rib eye over cooked . I presume it is Gordon Ramsey Restaurant in name only . On the first night we left Mc Gills Pub & went up stairs to the lounge as the seats were very comfortable but the waiter informed us that we could only get one drink as they stopped serving drinks in lounge at 10.30pm , he arrived with the drink & the bill & rushed us to settle up , he never informed us that we could bring drinks up from the bar , which we did the following night ourselves . Breakfast was exceptional , great choice, the over flow was served in the lounge upstairs which was a little chaotic on Easter Sunday morning .  These small issues didn't take away from our stay. The Spa /Pool was lovely , my friends had treatments & they were very satisfied but book ahead as they were very busy . The one thing that set this hotel apart is the staff - they were friendly, efficient & went out of their way to make our stay enjoyable. It was the type of service you get when you visit the U.S . They recommended a restaurant in Enniskerry which they booked & We were dropped down & collected in the hotel car . It's the little things that set this hotel apart . I have no hesitation in recommending this hotel and I hope to return , maybe when the sun shines and we can enjoy a glass of wine or afternoon tea on the terrace over looking the mountains & the County Wicklow countryside . ",5,2013,04,01
217,"Nice hotel, but not quite up to 5 star standards","We traveled to Ireland with another couple on a Groupon deal from Chicago.  When we first drove up the hotel looked a little out of place in the Irish countryside.  Check-in was quick and we were escorted to our suite (we upgraded for a pretty reasonable fee which also included dinner and free entry to many attractions).  The decor of the hotel was not to our taste at all, very opulent and formal.  The room was very spacious (about 700 sqft) with a separate sitting room and bedroom.  Again the furnishings were very formal and not that inviting, more like staying in a palace than a hotel.  The bathroom had two sinks, separate tub and shower with a rain showerhead and a TV in the mirror which did prove to be nice to watch while getting ready.  There was also a huge walk-in closet with a dressing room which was useful to store all of your luggage and clothing during our stay.  The room had TV in the sitting area and the bedroom which would have been nice if there was actually anything decent to watch on TV, for the most part we did not even turn them on.  Everyone mentions the touchscreens used to operate the HVAC, lights and curtains in the room.  At first I thought they were cool, but after a couple days they were more of a hindrance.  Sometimes it is just easier to have light switches and a normal thermostat.  It didn't help that one was hanging falling off the wall and they required multiple taps on the screen for things to function.  The most disappointing aspect of the room was the quality of the mattress, bed linens and toiletries, which in my opinion make or break your stay at a hotel.  The mattress was terrible and very soft; there were huge valleys on either side of the bed where people slept.  After a couple nights of restless night’s sleep we asked the front desk to swap out the mattress and they said it was probably the bed boards which are just pieces of wood under the mattress to support it.  On the third night we tried it again after they checked the bed boards and found no difference.  They checked it again on the fourth day and found that we were sleeping on the wrong side of the mattress with no padding between the springs and the sleeping surface.  They finally swapped that mattress out and it proved a little better but it still felt like we were sleeping in the bed of a 2 star hotel in the US.  The bed linens were not what you would expect from a 5 star hotel either.  The bath toiletries were very small and again were more on par with a 2 star US hotel.  Again not what you would expect from a 5 star Ritz Carlton.

We visited the pool once and while it was defiantly an amazing pool to look at it was too cold to swim in after a cold day outside, even the hot tub was more of a warm tub.  We ate the breakfast buffet three times during our stay and even at half price (14 Euros) I thought it was a little expensive for what you got.  Not much variety by US standards and all three days exactly the same things were in the buffet.  We also ate at McGill’s twice and loved the food.  The Fish and chips were the best we have tasted, but it was a little pricey.  

The location was very picturesque and the town of Enniskerry was very nice and charming.  It sounds like many locals and UK tourist stay at this hotel for weekend getaways and this hotel is perfect for that, but not as home base for touring the country.  No matter which direction you travelled you had to go back north to Dublin and out which took quite a bit of time up during the week we were there.  I wish we would have stayed in Dublin, it would have saved a bunch of time and Dublin was also a blast while we toured the city for 2 days.

All in all this hotel cannot hold a candle to the several Four Seasons hotels we have stayed at in the US and Canada.  They are just not at the same level in our opinion in terms of quality or service.  My rating of 3 stars would be 3.5 if that was possible, but it is based on comparing this hotel to other 5 star hotels in the US and Canada that I have stayed at.  This was our first trip to Europe so maybe their definition of 5 stars is different, but with a brand such as Ritz-Carlton you would expect some consistency and the high standards they have in the US.",3,2013,04,01
217,Beautiful Property,"We stayed for six nights. The rooms are beautifully done. Our room was on the sixth floor on a corner (649). While we had the parking lot view, our balcony wrapped around and we had a view of the mountains as well. We ate in McGills Pub one night and the food was quite good (a little pricey though). The only complaints I have was the broken ice machine on our floor,and our housekeeping service. I didn't feel it was as up to par as it should have been. We did not receive turn down service one time while we were there, our pot for coffee had some dark residue in it, (it should have only had water in it), and our housekeeper actually left cleaning solution in our bathroom.  One last thing, the pool is absolutely beautiful, but the water temperature could stand to be a little warmer. I love swimming, but it was a little too chilly to enjoy.",4,2013,03,28
217,Luxurious night away,"Perfect place to get away for a night if live in Dublin and short on time. Minimal travel time. Arrived at 1pm expecting to leave luggage in foyer but room was ready early. Given room upgrade for wedding anniversary with delectable chocolates. Room amazingly luxurious. Pool a little cool as was the serenity room in spa. Did not stay there long as a result. Scented showers didn't work either. Massage was fantastic as was sauna. Complimentary dessert given at gordan Ramsey for anniversary. Lots to do in local area. Complimentary bikes, access to river walk, powerscourt house shops, enniskerry village but freezing cold so stayed in hotel mostly. Disappointed with hotel grounds-expected more formal gardens, quite bare & unfinished. Will be back again though when I need a getaway. Felt extremely relaxed after just 24hours. Staff are a valuable asset here-everyone helpful and pleasant.",5,2013,03,26
217,Absolutely Wonderful Hotel,"The hotel is absolutely beautiful. We had a suite overlooking the fountain. It was very spacious, it had an enormous marble bathroom with a big tub, seperate shower and water closet. Dual sinks and TV in the mirror. It had a huge dressing room with closets. The bed room and living room were a very nice size. It had the ""Smart"" technology screen for each room so that all you had to do do was to touch it and you could shut lights and curtains. The hotel staff was amazing. I wasn't feeling good when we arrived and they brought me to a doctor immediately and then picked us up. Over all, they couldn't be more accomodating and professional. The hotel is about 20 minutes from Dublin and I would highly recommend staying here if you are planning a trip to Ireland. We also enjoyed all that the Powerscourt area had to offer such as the mansion, gardens and waterfall.",5,2013,03,25
217,Amazing day spa,"My mother and sister have been to the day spa a few times since we got married. All I can say is its worth the money. The staff are very friendly and the package we had was 2 hour treatments was glorious. Always a pleasure. The spa area is lovely and relaxing, we have gone midweek so its never too busy. The lunch is always delicious. We have never stayed the night as we live so close to it. Definitely worth a trip to it. We will be going again soon.",4,2013,03,25
217,Fantastic,"Fantastic stay. Booked the mountain view suite as part of the Gordon Ramsey package for an overnight break to celebrate our anniversary. There was a personalised note in the room with some homemade macaroons. The dinner in the Gordon Ramsey restaurant was excellent value as part of this package and absolutely delicious. Service in the restaurant was excellent. Breakfast was also great-good choice and very tasty. The room was spacious and very quiet. Loved the walk-in wardrobe and touchscreen control pad on the walls. We had 2 bathrooms. The main bathroom was huge and had a choice of bath or separate shower. Loved the TV in the bathroom! All staff were very helpful. 
Location great as it is so close to Dublin yet feels like you are getting away from it all. 
Enjoyed a walk in the Powerscourt Gardens, followed by shopping in Avoca and a snack in the delicious Avoca cafe. Went to the Powerscourt waterfall the next day as we were too late to see it on the Saturday night. A little disappointed by this. Quite expensive. There is a little playground there which is great for kids. 
Have booked another overnight stay for Easter and we are taking the kids with us this time.",5,2013,03,25
217,Fantastic weekend and service was the best!,"My friend and I went to the hotel for a birthday celebration recently and we were blown away by how well we were treated at the Ritz Carlton. The staff went out of their way to make us both feel so special and were kind enough to upgrade our room, give us gifts of handmade chocolate and birthday cake! The staff seem to really like working there and nothing is too much trouble. I will be back for sure and a huge thanks to all the staff in the hotel from bell boy, to reception to restaurant and bar staff....5 star training and 5 star treatment, WELL DONE!",5,2013,03,25
217,No 5 star rating,"Stayed here for 2 nights with my wife and child and as a hotel it was fine with lovely views and staff are friendly but service let it down. I wouldn't rate this as a 5 star hotel at all. I booked our stay off their website and requested a early check-in stating we would be arriving at 12.30/1.00pm. I also requested a travel cot for our room. We arrived at hotel at 12.30 and upon checking in, the guy who was very pleasant and welcoming, told us that our room wasn't quite ready yet but he would inform housekeeping and it would be put to the top of their list. He told me to have a seat in the lobby or we could have some tea or lunch and that he would ring me once room was ready but it wouldn't be too long. We were waiting almost 2hours before I got the call. We were escorted to our room as part of the service and the gentleman showed us around the room but we noticed there was no travel cot. He said he would get housekeeping to drop one up. At 6pm there was still no sign of travel cot so we rang reception and about 1hour later we finally got the travel cot. The room itself was lovely and spacious although my wife taught the decor was a bit dated. It was clean in parts but lamp shades were very dusty as was the ledge above the bed. Obviously hadn't seen a rub of a cloth in a while. So while they have the touchpad lights and curtains, its the simple things and the personal touch that I felt are lacking in which you would truly expect from a 5 star hotel. Food was average and for price they charging I can't really say anything else. My wife did order a salad for lunch which as described on menu came with mixture of baby lettuces and goats cheese. The salad arrived out and there was no goats cheese. So overall would I reccommend this hotel....absolutely not. For the prices they charge to stay here, service and quality of food, there is plenty of other 5 star hotels which are better value so I certainly won't be returning.",3,2013,03,23
217,Loved it!,"The Ritz-Carlton at Powerscourt was the perfect place for our week in Ireland. My husband and I were celebrating our Second Honeymoon (yes, you can have 2) and the we were greeted in our suite with a bottle of Prosecco and gourmet chocolates. It was a lovely touch. We were upgraded from the standard suite to one of the corner suites with the great mountain view. I wish we were still there. It was wonderful. The staff was helpful and kind. We went on the river walk on the property and talked with locals. 

Oh goodness the pool. I cannot forget. This was delightful. My husband and I are swimmers so we used this nightly. I think many of the guests under-utilize the spa facilities. The steam room was the perfect was to take the chill off after long hikes in the 0 degree weather. My only suggestion is to increase the temperature in the hot tub as my husband and other guests commented that it was not quite hot enough. 

All in all this is a great resort. It's close to Dublin, the Wicklow Mountains, and many of the popular historical sites. It is quite far from the west coast (3.5 hours) if you want to visit the Cliffs of Moher or other sites. We did take this trek but it took an entire day of driving which was not pleasant. There are many places to eat nearby. McGills is yummy but not particularly healthy. The Powerscourt dining hall is wonderful. Poppies is great. Try the beef and Guinness pie. Emilia's Italian restaurant is the best in the town by far. Try the Risotto Mare- yummy. Also, grab a bottle of wine at the local wine store so you can enjoy in your suite.

We did the morning breakfast buffet and it was delicious. It included nearly everything that could possibly be perceived as western breakfast type foods. It was delicious. I'm not that much of a breakfast person, so at 28 euros, it probably wasn't worth it for myself, but was a treat anyways.",5,2013,03,22
217,Over priced & under delivered,"I stayed with my friend on the spa package on the 2nd February 2013. The room was lovely and the spa treatment just about ok but everything else was over promised and under delivered. When we arrived, we were greeted by what I can only describe as a sickening over bearing fake niceness of the staff. It was too much. We were escorted to our room by a young man who was nice but came a cross as being very fake. He walked with us to our room, I would have expected he drop the bags into our room once we had a chance to see it. It was all very awkward, even in the lift. Forced conversation. I could not even organise a tip because he was there the whole time. The spa treatment was fine in terms of the actual treatment but I was cold. And the therapist knew I was cold because she could feel my hands and feet and they were like ice. She never said anything and didn't  even offer to turn up the heat. I thought this was unprofessional. She should have known better for a 5 star hotel spa. I said nothing. Didn't feel there was a point. 
We went to bar for food as we didn't want to put any pressure on ourselves in terms of booking a table for the restaurant. We should have booked the restaurant as the bar service and food was dreadful. We ordered fish and chips and I can only compare it to a fish and chip van. Greasy, over battered fish & artificial peas. The wine we ordered was disappointing. Why stock poor quality wines. 
We had a good sleep and the room was nice. Breakfast was terrible. I ordered an omelette and it took 55 min to make. Longest breakfast I have ever had in a hotel. My friend was finished her breakfast and I was left waiting so it all became a little awkward as I went to chase my omelette. 
We did make our views known re the breakfast and the bar food at check out, only to be told, oh very sorry about that as the receptionist scanned my credit card repeatedly. Maybe we were unlucky but I will say this, I won't be visiting again and I won't be recommending to anyone.",1,2013,03,20
217,Very nice stay... but puzzled at some behaviour,"We stayed at The Ritz-Carlton Powerscourt to celebrate our wedding anniversary. The is no doubt that the hotel is one of the finest in Ireland - our room was stunning, beautiful linens, clean and fresh room, spacious and comfortable. Dinner was excellent in Restaurant Gordon Ramsay, and we were lucky to have book the chefs table, which is a brilliant experience.  Pool area was lovely (be warned - children are allowed to use the facilities all day long on Bank Holiday weekends, rather than having family hours) 
The downsides - both sides of our family called to organise a bottle of something to help us celebrate our first wedding anniversary. The first was told that it was not possible without faxing through details of a credit card, and they don't have a fax machine. The second gave their credit card details over the phone and we were never sent the bottle. When they asked us had we enjoyed the bottle they had arranged, our blank faces gave the game away.  Although they were not charged for it, I was uncomfortable at the thought that someone had taken their details and not followed through with the request.
The breakfast was a shambles - the hotel was at full capacity and the restaurant was full so a number of us were sent to the lounge to eat a breakfast that had been ''assembled'' there.  The staff were questioning what 'package' people were on before they would allow them to sit down - which for a 5 star hotel I would have thought was the height of rudeness.  A child of no more than 12 years of age had been sent down from the room to reserve a table for his family. The staff refused him entry as 'breakfast was not included in his package' and they were obviously afraid to give him a table incase the parents decided that they weren't going to pay for it. The child was mortified and didn't know what to do - poor call on the hotel staffs side. Just made the whole thing very uncomfortable for everyone involved.
At checkout, there were items on our bill which we were charged twice for and we questioned. The mistake was quite evident, yet it seemed quite a problem for the girl to remove and it was even harder for her to apologise for.  A simple sorry for our mistake would have been sufficient - but it wasn't forthcoming.   Finally, as we were leaving, a family of 4 arrived in from the airport - parents with 2 small children.  They had enough bags with them to do them a week, it was obvious they were not there for one night.  The children were tired and the mother asked if she could please have a room so they might have a quick nap. She was sharply told that her room wasn't ready.  When she was told she could go and use the facilities of the hotel, she asked where she could charge items to, as she had no room number. The hotel coldly told her she would have to settle these charges - she couldn't charge to her room yet.  Yet 5 minutes later, when a well-known Irish personality asked could he drop his bags off as he was heading for downstairs for lunch and he'd check in later, they had no problem in assuring him that his room was ready and he could check in at whatever time he liked.  All hotel guests should be treated the same, especially in such a hotel where they should pride themselves on class and elegance.",4,2013,03,20
217,A relaxation haven,"This hotel is one of the best 5 star hotels in Ireland. It has fabulous rooms that cater for your every need. When we stayed we received the most fantastic customer service from the door, reception, to our room - Nothing was too much trouble. The breakfast is really lovely, with lovely views over the gardens. The spa is a relaxation haven, it has a womens/mens only hydrotherapy area, a lovely relaxation room and the pool has a really nice layout (although it is a little bit dark). I found the main pool a little bit on the cool side but with a lovely jacuzzi right beside it - it didn't disappoint! I recommmend this hotel to anyone looking for a real relaxing treat.",5,2013,03,20
217,"Very nice, a little remote","This is what you would expect from a Ritz... nice facility, good service, good food. The location is nice if you are interested in driving out - great for exploring with a car! I was upgraded to the presidential suite and it was wonderful.",4,2013,03,19
217,Nicest hotel imaginable,"Stayed for st Patrick's weekend for 3nights Friday-Monday. Hotel was fairly quiet on Friday but got very busy both Saturday and Sunday. Saying that the hotel is so spacious that it never felt too busy! Food from room service/sugarloaf both excellent and average from mc gills. Spa and pool area fabulous and again not too busy. We have stayed here multiple times but never in a room as nice as the one we got this time (number 238) it was gorgeous....even had a kitchen. So spacious, clean and modern! No complaints whatsoever! Can't wait to go back and we are barely home! We can think of no better hotel! ",5,2013,03,18
217,Amazing!,"Stayed here on our last night in Ireland and it was the perfect place to wind down a hectic week of driving all over the country. The room was spacious/grand, and although we were on the ground floor still had a good view of the mountains. The room was spacious and the bed is probably the most comfortable bed I've ever slept in. In addition, the bathroom is amazing with a tv in the mirror and the toilet in it's own seperate area. We used the pool and hot-tub and you could easily fall asleep down there. The pool is indoor and extremely quiet. The hot-tub just didn't seem ""hot"" enough, that was my only real complaint. Other then that, the food is great but typical hotel prices really get you. If you are staying for mulitple nights I would ask the front desk if they could have a driver drive you down to town for dinner at the pub. May save you a few dollars for sure. The front-desk staff were extremely courteous upon check-out and you can even pay your toll up front if you are driving towards the airport upon check-out. Also very good with the directions to the airport. *Note, this is about 20 miles from Dublin but inside Wicklow county so still plenty to do! The pub inside the hotel seems to do nightly Irish music so definetly worth it to check out, but get there early as it's small. A great time though and I'll miss the touch-pads around the room.",5,2013,03,18
217,Stunning Hotel. Stunning Setting.,"We were very fortunate to choose the Ritz Carlton Powerscourt to celebrate my 50th birthday weekend.  I had thought of going abroad but then decided to try a hotel closer to home and am so glad that we did.  The hotel itself is a stunning building with a backdrop of the Wicklow Mountains.  It did help that we had sunshine from we arrived on Thursday 28 February until we left on Sunday 3 March 2013.  We were given a warm welcome on arrival and escorted to our beautiful mountainview suite.  The hotel's decor is traditional and grand, very comfortable and spotlessly clean.  The suite consisted of a huge white marble fully kitted bathroom, large dressing room with all the amenities (safe, iron/ironing board, slippers, umbrella, bathrobes).  The living room was very comfortable and the bedroom a good size with the most comfortable bed - like sleeping on a cloud (I imagine!).  There was turndown every evening and the room was serviced regularly.  Our first couple of days were so quiet, by the Sunday morning the hotel was very busy - I believe 98% occupancy which in this time of recession is good to see although breakfast was a little more hectic that morning.  We had dinner in the Gordon Ramsey Restaurant which was a fantastic experience - the restaurant would be a great 'stand alone' restaurant in any city.  We also ate in McGills pub - huge portions and very tasty.  There was a great singer/guitarst on the Friday evening.  On our final evening we ate in the Sugar Loaf Lounge - again great food and fab martini cocktails.  Breakfast in Gordon Ramsey was a treat and we also enjoyed breakfast in the Sugar Loaf on our final morning.  We walked miles - hotel residents have access to the private River Walk which I would recommend, the gardens are beautiful.  And Powerscourt House with the Avoca cafe and shops is beside the hotel as is the quaint village of Enniskerry.  And dont forget you have beautiful Wicklow on your doorstep - we drove the mountains and walked around the Glendalough lakes - some of the most beautiful scenery in the world.  Yes the hotel is expensive but it is the Ritz and it is Ireland and the memories will stay with you forever.  Thanks to my husband for a great birthday and thanks to the Ritz Carlton Powerscourt!",5,2013,03,17
217,Luxury hotel south of Dublin,"This hotel is the epitome of luxury the rooms are amazing with large walkin closets and bathrooms and touch pads to control lights, temp and curtains in the room. Mcgills bar was a fun pub atmosphere with great good for dinner. I will say breakfast is abut pricey for what you get so you may consider one if the Cafe's in enniskerry. The pool is amazing with and heated in a warm spa like room for relaxing. This hotel is a good 30 min from dublin but we stayed here our last night before we flew home and it was perfect. Comp parking and you don't have to drive in the city!",5,2013,03,17
217,Stunning!,"We stayed here the first week of  March with a Groupon Getaway vacation and it was absolutely wonderful! The staff was friendly and attentive to our needs.They went of their way to make us feel welcome. The room we had was spacious and beautiful.The beds and pillows were comfortable.The bathrooms had robes and there were slippers in the closet.  There was coffee in the room and a minibar filled with drinks. The grounds were beautiful and there is a walking path close to the hotel. There is plenty of parking space, there is an outside parking lot and an underground parking garage. The reception desk was helpful with directions when the concierge was not available. We ate at McGills on Sunday night before we left and the food was delicious.
I visited the spa and pool area and it was a very calming atmosphere. This is definitely a 5 star hotel and I would highly recommend Ritz-Carlton Powerscourt for your hotel stay.",5,2013,03,15
217,Outstanding Hotel!!!,"My wife and I just returned from an incredible one week trip to Ireland.  Booked through Groupon and Sceptre Tours, it included a six night stay at the Ritz Carlton, Powerscourt hotel.  This hotel is a gem among gems!  Outstanding staff, service, huge rooms - we upgraded, for very little, to a suite - a 700 square ft apartment!  The breakfast buffet is the best we have ever been to - and at a special price for hotel guests.  The Gordon Ramsay Restaurant served us a magnificent meal at very competitive prices.  We cannot say enough good about this hotel, and can't imagine staying anywhere else in Ireland when we go next time.",5,2013,03,15
217,The Spa Experience is Excellent,"I went here for a day spa treatment and it was just excellent You have access to the Facilities all day up until 9 pm at night, The staff were so lovely and the treatments were great. I would highly recommend this for a day out lunch is included and there is 2 Jacuzzi's, steam rooms, saunas swimming pool and fab showers their products are fab they also have a serenity room to relax in which is great , If your looking for a day of relaxation and a real treat it is well worth it. Will definitely be back. The hotel itself is pricey for drinks etc but well worth a visit beautiful surroundings and lovely staff..",5,2013,03,15
217,Wonderful,"My hubby and I stayed for two fabulous nights in a Mountainview Suite - 28th Feb, 1st March.
The suite was extremely comfortable, spotless, warm and with everything you could ever need in it. The view was stunning from our balcony.  Absolute luxury.
The staff were warm and genuinely welcoming and made our stay a delight.
The afternoon tea in the Sugarloaf is well worth having and we had two gorgeous meals in the Gordon Ramsey restaurant.  It's expensive, but a real treat.
The grounds around the hotel are immaculate and the walk to the Avoca shop is well worth doing.
The only disappointment was the spa was fully booked, so we will have to go back again to try a treatment or two!
Thank you Ritz Carlton for a wonderful two days.",5,2013,03,15
217,Beautiful Property,"Stayed here 5 nights. Hotel is beautiful and staff excellent. Concierge Trish was great!   Our deluxe room was very spacious and the beds so comfy!  There was coffee in the room which was an added benefit since the coffee in the restaurant, which wasn't even good, was 5.30 euros. You can buy snacks and fresh breads and pastries in the shop in Powerscourt Gardens. You don't have to pay just to go into the shops. The town of Enniskerry is also very quaint and has a little grocery store. Like others have said, if you want to stay away from the city, this is a great place, probably for a weekend trip. But if you are going on vacation in Ireland, you should not base your trip from this hotel, you should move around to different locations.",4,2013,03,14
217,Expensive,"Stayed there a short time ago.  Really nice but very expensive. Very relaxing stay, staff very good, had a few drinks in McGills Irish bar and ate there also as we thought Gordon Ramseys overpriced. Enjoyed the spa. Powerscourt gardens are right beside hotel and worth a visit but they would be nicer in Summer. Overall really nice time but couldnt afford it too often.",4,2013,03,08
217,Fantastic but expensive,"We stayed in Ritz for valentines. It was a great stay. Reception staff was very accommodating with changing our restaurant reservation and sorting out our room for our early arrival.
Our standard room was very big and luxurious, we had a really good sleep. Hotel has fantastic Irish bar in it and lobby bar has great views. Surroundings of hotel are amazing as its right beside Powerscourt gardens. You have to take into account that its about 30 min drive to Dublin and you need to drive to get anywhere. Hopefully the reason you will visit this hotel is to relax and get away from the town! Spa and swimming pool was also excellent.
We ate at Gordon Ramsey restaurant. We had a 5 course meal package. I have to say that stake really was amazing but other 4 courses were just average.

Our only negativity with this hotel was price of some of the basic things compared to other 5 star hotels. Small bottle of water was 5 EUR! Small bottle of beer nearly 7 EUR and regular massage over 130 EUR. If you are feeling rich it might not be a problem but 5 euro for water, cmon!",4,2013,03,05
217,Beautiful hotel in a beautiful setting,"Stayed here for just one night to celebrate our wedding anniversary. The room was very spacious and well appointed. The hotel had left us some chocolates and a card to acknowledge our special weekend. 
We did have a minor issue with the TV in the bathroom but this was quickly sorted out. 
We ate at the Gordon Ramsey restaurant; however, we were not over-whelmed by the food there. The service was great though! 
We did make use of the pool area, which was great! It wasn't too busy so it was easy to relax.

The hotel is also set in the Powerscourt area of Wicklow. There are lots of walks etc to do if that's your thing! 

We would return and would recommend to others",4,2013,03,04
217,"Relaxing, pampered stay","Incredible hospitality and service! We felt so pampered. Everything about the place was top-notch. The room was spacious. The beds were very comfortable. We stayed for a week, ate breakfast at the Gordan Ramsey room a couple of times, had supper at McGill's, had tea and lunch in the Lounge, used the pool and the services of the concierge, and made a couple of requests of housekeeping. We consistently met with friendly, courteous, well-trained staff and well-kept facilities. I saw more smiles that week than you see on the red carpet at the Oscars.",5,2013,03,02
217,Lovely hotel,"Loved the room with the mountain view. I was expecting a room and it turned out to be a suite. The staff were so friendly,  the food was great and the playroom was great fun for the kids. Would definitely go again. ",5,2013,03,01
217,amazing!!,This is by far the best hotel That I have stayed in! service and general warmth from everyone was special...the breakfast and evening meals were second to none!! the scenery is outstanding and soo much to do for families and adults alike!!,5,2013,03,01
217,"As expected, First Class at the Ritz",Everything you would expect at a Ritz including high prices for food and drink. We really enjoyed our stay but avoided eating in the hotel much due to the prices. There are several nice local restaurants in town 1 KM away that are very reasonable and quite tasty. Transportation into Dublin was ok by public transport (bus and train). The biggest negative is the somewhat remote location. Still a very enjoyable stay!,4,2013,02,26
217,Very nice!,"Very friendly staff, beautiful grounds and excellent rooms! It's Powerscourt which is located in Enniskerry which is a great town, they offer free shuttle rides and all the restaurants and pubs will call the hotel to pick you up. Great restaurants in the town.",5,2013,02,25
217,Amazing,"We stayed for 3 nights for our Anniversary in November and from the moment we arrived its was wow.
Many thanks to the staff who upgraded us as a surprise to a suite. It was a truly amazing experience and an fantastic suite.
Not many 5 star hotels are this family friendly. It was Halloween and there was over a week of activities set out for the children. On Halloween night they arranged trick or treat around the hotel which made our son very happy.
The only let down was that for a hotel of this grandeur, the breakfast was a huge let down. The food was good, but that's if you could get some. The hotel didn't seem that busy, but one morning we didn't get seated downstairs in the restaurant and were seated upstairs in the over flow in the bar area. This really felt like an over flow. The staff didn't seem well trained for breakfast upstairs, and that's if you found an English speaking waitress, it was hard trying to ask for tea, yes that bad. I went up several times to try to get a full hot breakfast, but on no occasion was there a full buffet. Either no sausages, or bacon, something was always missing. The selection of food was also smaller. This was not the case downstairs, so my advise is if they try to put you upstairs, ask to wait. Its not worth it.
We ate twice in the hotel in the evening, once in the lounge and once in the Gordon Ramsey. Due to the poor exchange rate between the pound and euro, it made the Gordon Ramsey seem very expensive and we felt the food in the lounge was just as nice, if not nicer for half the price.
The location of the hotel is lovely, set in great grounds. The hotel is clean, cleaned to beyond clean. I went to the swimming pool on 2 evenings and this is a experience not to be missed, its like swimming at night in the dark.
It wouldn't take much to make this place perfect.
If you get the chance to stay here, then do, its a must.",5,2013,02,25
217,WOW - This place is spectacular!!,"I stayed in a mountain-view suite over the weekend and was totally blown away by the opulence and glamour of this celtic tiger-era property. Our welcome by front of house staff was excellent, polished, professional and helpful. Our suite was ready even though we were two hours early for check in so we went to explore. My, oh my this is a glamorous place! The decor throughout the hotel is luxurious and palatial. This hotel is a monument to excess and luxury. It might not be to everyone's taste given its over-the-top glory but we absolutely loved it. Our suite was spacious and gorgeous, finished to a very high spec. We even had a bathroom in-mirror TV!! Our rate included bed & breakfast. Given the extraordinarily high-spec of the hotel (it is a true 5star property) we felt we got a bit of a bargain. Drinks and food here are extortionately expensive but you expect that from this class of establishment. All guests can access the wonderful tranquil swimming pool & hamman spa with the hotel's complements and I strongly urge you to do so. For my money it is certainly one of the best hotels in Ireland right now, set in one of the nicest old Estates in the country and I wouldn't hesitate to recommend it to friends and family.",5,2013,02,24
217,The very best.,"I hosted a tour of Sacred Places in Ireland for a small group (16) of American psychotherapists and their families.  Early in the planning stages, we decided to splurge a bit and stay in this magnificent resort for the second half of the trip.  Julia and Cathy went above and beyond their duties for our group - from checking in on our well being after hurricane Sandy, to booking dining and spa appointments, to offering personal cell phone numbers on the day of our arrival.  Our group wanted for nothing.  Please ignore any negative comments about this place.  The rooms/grounds are amazing, the spa was the best I have ever seen, the food was exquisite and the staff was incredibly attentive.  My family travels to Ireland every year and we will end all of our trips with a stay at the Ritz from now on.  Do yourself a favor and book your stay - you will not regret it.",5,2013,02,24
217,A little slice of heaven,"We stayed in the Ritz-Carlton Powerscourt for our anniversary. It was a last-minute booking, and I knew nothing about the hotel, so I didn't have high expectations. To my delight it proved to be one of the nicest hotels I have stayed at -- and I have stayed at a LOT of hotels! It's a beautiful building. I assumed it was an old mansion which had been converted, but apparently it's actually a newbuild. Either way, it's a stunning building, with a gorgeous sunken garden on the way in.

The room we stayed in, 314, was large and hi-tech, with lots of thoughtful features. There was also a small terrace with nice views. The bed was extremely comfortable, there were two sinks (one of our favourite bonuses in any hotel!), a TV in the bathroom, lots of wardrobe space, fast wi-fi, very quiet, a good shower, and a doored area for the toilet.

We went to the spa for a treatment and were highly impressed. It's nicely laid out, with relaxing views that it makes full use of. Sauna, steam room, a large whirlpool-type pool, plenty of space to relax in. The swimming pool looked incredibly stylish and contemporary. Our treatments were lovely and very professional.

We ate in the Gordon Ramsay restaurant, and the meal was first-rate. You could order a la carte, or from a 3 course menu for €33 which was great value. Wines were reasonably priced too, although there were lots of costlier bottles if you wanted to push the boat out. We had breakfast in the restaurant the following morning, and although it was a buffet, that was high quality too, and we got to enjoy the views which we couldn't see in the darkness the night before.

The staff were wonderful. They really couldn't do enough to help. We were waiting to chat to someone at reception at one point, and seeing that it was busy, one of the bellboys called for the concierge to deal with us. We expressed an interest in going into Enniskerry village to have a drink in a local pub (and the village is well worth visiting), but were concerned that we would not make it back in time to get ready for dinner -- we were told that wouldn't be a problem, and if we asked the staff in the pub to ring the hotel, they would send a car to pick us up (this was complimentary, not charged). There's also a nicely themed pub in the hotel -- drinks are far more expensive than they are in the village, of course, but if you don't mind that, it's a good place to hole up for a few hours.

There are some very nice walks around the hotel -- we did part of the river walk -- and more to see and do in the Wicklow hills nearby if you want to venture further afield. You're also very close to Dublin, so you could certainly use this as a base if you wanted to visit the city but not stay there, although I would recommend you only do this if you have a car.

All in all, we only had one complaint at the end of our trip -- we wish we had booked to stay for longer!!",5,2013,02,24
217,This place is the RITZ,"The property is magnificent.  The views are spectacular.  The service is impeccable.  The rooms are comfortable, clean, and spacious.  Everything you could want in a resort.  I highly recommend this place.  Plus they offer a convenient shuttle bus that runs to the center of the small town of Enniskerry, which is convenient if you want to stay in town & enjoy a few beers or if you want to catch the bus into Dublin.  We really enjoyed hanging with the locals at Mac's Pub every evening, before heading back up to the hotel.  I didn't golf, but from what I could see, the course was amazing.  It really is the best place to stay in Ireland.",5,2013,02,22
217,Afternoon tea at the Ritz,"The setting is lovely. The service was polite but slow -  we got our tea long before our food, and the tea was not really hot. My tea cup was dirty, and the tea was made with tea bags, not leaves.However the savory sandwiches, scones and cakes were very good.
 Worst was that there was no child free zone, and hearing parents loudly asking their children repeatedly if they needed to pee was not pleasant.",3,2013,02,21
217,The Perfect Trip!,"My husband and I traveled to Ireland via a Groupon with Sceptre Tours.  What an amazing trip we had. The Ritz did not dissapoint. First class all the way. The room (lowest priced) was so luxurious that I thought we had been given a suite by mistake! They even allowed us into the room at 6 a.m. on our arrival day (as our flight was super early). The pool and hamman (steam room) are every bit as beautiful as the pictures. The highlight was our dinner at Gordon Ramsey's restaurant. They had a price fix meal (Tues- Thurs.) that was probably the best meal I've ever eaten (at an incredibly reasonable cost). We used the Ritz as our home base and drove (on the wrong side of the road, on twisty, tiny roads) to places like Glendalaugh, Kilkenny, Rock of Cashel, Trim, Malahide.  The town of Enniskerry is small but awesome. You MUST stop in Mac's Bar and drink a pint or two or ten with the locals. The owner Mash will make you feel at home the minute you walk in, as will all the gentlemen.  They even kept the pub open until 4:30 a.m. to allow us to watch the Superbowl til it's conclusion.  The Powerscourt Estate and Waterfalls are beautiful- and that was during the Winter! I can only imagine how it will look when everything is in bloom.  This was truly the trip of a lifetime.",5,2013,02,19
217,Putting on the Ritz,"An amazing luxurious few days. The staff are so friendly and helpful. A warm welcome on arrival and gasps of amazement entering the bedroom with separate dressing room and bathroom
Loved the fact each room had its own doorbell and the bathroom had a TV in the mirror.
The food was top of the shop with the to die for homemade wheaten bread. A big round of applause to all who work to provide the best stay. I asked where I could buy a loaf of the bread only to be given a whole loaf by the lady looking after the breakfasts.
The extensive grounds offer views and walks take will take your breath away.",5,2013,02,17
217,"Fabulous, true 5 star elegance and service","My partner and i have just returned from a one night stay at the Ritz, we thoroughly enjoyed the experience. We arrived at 11:15 way ahead of check in time, but the staff were very accomodating and we were shown to our room 211 not long after arrival. The hotel is tastefully decorated, the staff were so helpful and welcoming, the service is what really makes it special. Foolishly, we forgot to make a reservation for dinner, but we availed of the in room dining service for a small cost of e5, and it was fantastic the man who delivered it to our room was so helpful and efficient, our towels were replaced almost immediately after using them. The room was beautiful and spacious. There was everything you could need, even down to a clothes brush. There is a great selection of movies on the tv. We had lunch in the sugarloaf it was fantastic though a little pricey and there was not a great selection. Powerscourt house is just a short walk down the drive and has amazing scenery and gardens it also has shops and a cafe, we also went upstairs to taras palace, childhood museum it really is amazing the detail and workmanship which makes it a must see. I highly reccomend The Ritz-Carlton Powerscourt",5,2013,02,17
217,Second visit in ten months,"Another very good visit to the hotel.

Upgraded to a mountain view room thanks to booking via Amex Platinum card. The suite was much larger than last time. Guest bathroom, full kitchen which was extremely useful for the fridge etc, large and very comfortable dining table, balcony with table and chair for four, separate bedroom and bathroom. Very very good room.

Staff were excellent. We got breakfast in the room three out of four mornings. This was much better than the buffet breakfast. And the only extra was the $5 delivery charge.

The spa facilities were great. We did not use these on our first visit as that was for a conference. Pool was quiet even on the Saturday. Jacuzzi and steam room were some of the best I have encountered. 

Definitely worth a visit.",5,2013,02,17
217,"Great stay, excellent hotel.  Pricey","As expected with the Ritz-Carlton, this was a great hotel.  It is less than 10 years old, very modern, very clean.  The staff was extremely friendly and helpful.  Stayed in a standard room as part of a vacation package.  The room cost was part of the package so the price wasn't a concern, however any additional costs for the hotel were quite expensive, as expected for a hotel of this type.  Expect a 100 Euro charge per night to be added onto your credit card upon check-in to accomodate any ""incidentals"".  

Not too many options for eating dinner in the area past 6 pm, so plan on eating earlier or at the hotel.",5,2013,02,12
217,Cannot be beat!,"We stayed here after a 10 day trip through the Country and let me tell you, it was incredible.  The grounds are gorgeous!  The golf course was beautiful and so were the little shops near the hotel.  Our suite was great with all the top amenities.  The staff were all very helpful and the room service was right on.  We were able to go into the little town for coffee and walked around and had lunch at the pub.  Everyone was very friendly!  I cannot say enough great things about this hotel!  If you want a relaxing experience this is the place to be!",5,2013,02,12
217,The best hotel in Ireland for a relaxing break with great spa and relaxation,"A friend and I visited the hotel for two nights in July 2012 and I have to say it was one of the best stays for relaxation I have had in my very well-travelled life!

For a stay in a country without burning sunshine and beaches, a spa, good food, sumptuous surroundings and a fabulous wine list did it for me! The hotel as a venue is just magnificent; they have done a wonderful job restoring the venue, the rooms are absolutely huge (I live in Sydney so appreciate place to swing a cat!) and the bathrooms in particular are impressive (the bath tub was amazing in particular.) The dressing room was also an added bonus for someone travelling for three weeks! Also the attention to detail was really lovely, such as the small notes which include weather forecast upon turndown service really made us feel welcome!

The food was great; we ate in the upstairs restaurant rather than the Ramsey restaurant because we couldn't get a reservation (be sure to book ahead, we should have but forgot) - but the food seems to be the same as the downstairs restaurant. We were in the annex room upstairs which was much more intimate than the main room and quieter than the bar; be sure to ask for this area for small groups. And then there was the wine list... returning from Australia I was delighted at the choice of European wines! The French wines in particular are brilliantly chosen and quite affordable for the quality (cudos to the sommelier!) 

And then there was the spa. Amazing is not the word for it. The massage was on par for the price (it's expensive but good, not the best massage I've had but still worth it) - it's really about the surroundings and the attention to detail in the spa itself. The thermal rooms and relaxation room were amazing, it's really about the small things such as the ergonomic chairs, the privacy afforded each space, reading materials, snacks etc - I could have stayed there all day!

There are plenty of activities such as walks and bike treks which I've gone on before so didn't during the stay, so can't really comment too much. The picnic sets on offer though sound really lovely to someone who hasn't been to Ireland before. 

All in all, the perfect girls weekend away for a little spoiling!",5,2013,02,11
217,"Beautiful Hotel, Excellent Service.....excellent everything","I can't find anything I didn't like about the hotel. The staff was so nice, accomodations extremely clean and beautiful. Food in restaurant was great. Wonderful experience. ""Great pricing on 3 night stay also"". Planning on another visit in the future.",5,2013,02,07
217,Fantastic 3 days,"Brilliant hotel, the food was excellent and the thing that made it special was the staff. Nothing was to difficult and they were to help. So many other hotels could learn from this place in that good service should be something they strive for and these guys do it and do it well. 
We have a toddler and baby and they were made as welcome as us which when you have four year old that loves to run around makes all the difference. Be prepared to pay a bit but sometimes it's worth it just to see how the other half live.",5,2013,02,04
217,Gordon Ramsey experience,One word for our stay....perfect! Food was outstanding. Room was unreal. Staff go above and beyond their jobs! Cannot wait to go back. The hotel and surroundings were a little slice if heaven. The bar was good crack and each restaurant we ate in the food was first class. Extremely expensive but u get what you pay for. Quality. ,5,2013,02,03
217,Amazing Experience!,"We booked this through Groupon and a little skeptical at first. WOW, were we ever happily surprised!  It completely surpassed our expectations!  Superb service, beautiful accommodations and property; great food and delightfully friendly, accommodating staff made our experience a wonderful one!  The grounds were beautiful and the spa cannot be missed!  I've been to may top spas and ESPA at the Ritz Powerscourt was among the best! Definitely worth the price too! It was the total package!  Don't delay, book it. You'll be glad you did!",5,2013,01,31
217,Gordon Ramsay restaurant the highlight!,"Stayed here for one night.. grounds are lovely, its well worth a walk around.. In general staff were nice, bit robotic but pleasant all the same.. the lady at breakfast with blonde hair and glasses, she was the manager, was the nicest and the one who stood out from everyone we met. Breakfast was average nothing to write home about - waited ages for an omlette. Gordon ramsay restaurant was gorgeous, food excellant, I like the idea of a staff member walking around offering bread during your meal. Room was lovely we were upgraded to a superior room although kettle in room was mouldy and air conditioning wouldn't switch off from control panel in room, both issues resolved once reported to staff. Overall would not return bit pricey for current climate.",4,2013,01,30
217,Gorgeous luxury,"My husband and I enjoyed a wonderful week at the Ritz and all of its amenities made our stay so comfortable and luxurious. The bed, bathroom, dressing room, and restaurants were all very well maintained. Gorgeous views and great service topped it off. Expect to pay $$$ as it is the Ritz, but for us it was worth it!",5,2013,01,28
217,Gorgeous,"This hotel is gorgeous.  I stayed during a recent trip to Ireland from the US with a coupe of girlfriends.  We stayed in a suite.  The bathroom had heated floors, the beds were comfortable and the staff was quite friendly.  
We ate at all of the restaurants- breakfast buffet is amazing.  McGills was good.  Gordon Ramsay's dinner was a bit of a disappointment.  The salmon was very bland.  
The only bad thing was our floor did not have a functioning ice machine & our room was missing the ice bucket.  When we called to have a bucket and/or ice delivered, we waited over an hour.  Very minor in the grand scheme of things.
We stayed in January, so we didn't walk around the grounds much.  There s a garden within walking distance with breathtaking views of Sugar loaf Mountain.  
I would highly recommend this hotel.",5,2013,01,24
217,5 star prices but 3 star service,"Stayed recently at the ritz for a night. We were underwhelmed to say the least. Yes it is in a beautiful location but it is overpriced for the current economic reality. We had a few concerns
Our checkin was delayed after 3 pm!
Price of coffee 5.30 in bar!! No extras with it. Certainly not the best coffee ull ever have!
The pool area is nice although despite plenty of signs saying no children in jacuzzi there were 2 in nappies in it while we were there!!! Not very hygienic and no attempt to stop them by staff!
In terms of Gordon Ramsay experience the food was okay but the service with Laura was excellent esp as she was covering half the restaurant!
I would suggest no need for covering the restaurant name with a sticker with breakfast bar in mornings..
Even though we had presumed when u pay for b&b that's what you get but we found a number of items from the menu are excluded like basics such as waffles and french toast!!not v nice really!!
One would also expect the Paper to be sent to the room in a 5 star hotel.
The room itself was fabulous, we stayed in a suite but overall our experience there was average and not what we expected.
",3,2013,01,24
217,Let's celebrate!,"This 5 star hotel lived up to its reputation of providing 5 star treatment and is ideal for that special occasion. We were there for post wedding celebrations - a cream tea (with accompanying bubbly); one hour relaxation before a 3 course dinner; chat in the Bar until we collapsed into our luxury bedroom. My only regret was having insufficient time to enjoy the Hotel itself (too busy socializing) although I did get to have a quick dip in the fantastic swimming pool before dinner. Liked the small details in our room - eg one mirror tile in the shower. Service was excellent - One of the more senior waitresses was particularly helpful in directing me to my room. My only criticism was the touch pad for the room lighting - being over 50, and requiring reading specs I still prefer light switches. Our room rate (special wedding party deal?) was by Irish standards reasonable for a hotel of this calibre.",5,2013,01,23
217,Always a really enjoyable time at this hotel,"I have stayed here on a few occasion & have enjoyed it every time. The hotel was rather quiet on one of those visits, but it is still very much a luxurious place to stay & in a really stunning setting in Wicklow. All rooms I've stayed in have been amazing - really comfortable, spacious, with gorgeous bathrooms - but the suites here are really fabulous. The hotel restaurant is lovely, but I can't say it was really outstanding. The Irish bar is a little plastic/tacky but, that said, every time I've been there I've had fun, so don't let that put you off!

All in all this is a great hotel & I'm sure I'll be back again before long.",5,2013,01,21
217,Ritz Carlton Powerscourt - big beautiful views,"The Ritz Carlton Powerscourt is one of those hotels which is its own destination: stunning, absolutely stunning property. The way it was built into the area plays off of and accents beautifully the local beauty. Rooms are elegant and lovely. We had a suite with a large balcony and a full, and decked out, kitchen. We barely left the room, it had everything. Nearby you have the Powerscourt Estate which is so incredible to walk around the gardens and get lost in another world. Ireland is one of our absolutely favorite destinations as both the country and the people are wonderful.",5,2013,01,21
217,Gorgeous hotel with a fabulous staff,"From check in to check out, we were treated with excellence.  The hotel is gorgeous, the beds are so comfortable, the staff is more than happy to help you at any time.  The fireplaces in lounge area are lovely to sit by after a long day of sight seeing.  The pub is has an old country feel.  The spa and pool are luxurious and the gym has a lovely view of the grounds.  Its an excellent hotel and highly recommend to anyone who has the opportunity to stay here.",5,2013,01,20
217,Wonderful Honeymoon!,"My husband and I had a wonderful weeks stay here for our honeymoon. The property had rich views of the mountain. The concierge drove us into town and we didn't even have to wait for a ride. The rooms were very clean and housecleaning was prompt every day. The workers always said hello, how you were doing and went out of their way to answer questions and help you with anything you needed. The town of Enniskerry is beautiful and rustic. Full of Irish culture.",4,2013,01,19
217,Excellent Stay,"This was the perfect place to stay after a long flight at the beginning of our stay. There are enough activities close by to explore, but leaving time to relax.  Our one-bedroom suite was very nice and the bed was so comfortable. After landing in dublin we made our way to the Ritz and explored the area. We walked to the Powerscourt Estate from the hotel. There is a wonderful cafe there that we enjoyed for lunch.  After a long nap, we had a lovely dinner at Gordon Ramsey. There is even a pub in the hotel with live music making it possible to never leave. The hotel is lovely and the staff was excellent.  When we woke up the next morning we felt refreshed and ready to begin our drive around Ireland!",5,2013,01,19
217,Beautiful hotel!,"This was a beautiful hotel with very good service.  We arrived into town with friends who dropped us off in Enniskerry.  A local coffee shop owner was kind enough to call the hotel on our behalf and the concierge picked us up and took us up to the hotel.  We arrived early and our room was ready.  The one-bedroom suite we stayed in was both palatial and luxurious!  The grounds were also very lovely to walk in.  Thankfully, we had great weather.  The pool is beautiful as well.  My only complaint about the hotel was the spa - the treatments were expensive as was to be expected in such a hotel.  My husband and I each had a treatment.  Neither of us found the massage to be worth the expense.  Having been to several spas, I think you can definitely find better value for money.  

Also, keep in mind the hotel is quite a ways from central dublin.  It will run you about 50+ euros to get there.  The other option is a bus.",4,2013,01,14
217,Relaxing break,"Great out of town hotel, public areas very luxurious throughout. Very nice surrounding areas and great golf course. Highly recommend the spa and Gordon Ramsey restaurant. Staff very accommodating. However if a break to Dublin is what you are looking for I would recommend the Merrion.",4,2013,01,13
217,A Memorable Experience,"This was one of the best hotels I have ever stayed in!  We had a one-bedroom suite and it was huge.  There was a TV built into the bathroom mirror; the dressing room was a lovely room itself.  The staff were friendly and accommodating.  The decor was elegant and the beds were so comfortable!  I would highly recommend staying there, even though it was not in the city of Dublin itself.  It is next to the Powerscourt Gardens, which are also magnificent.",5,2013,01,13
217,Love It !,"Beautiful beautiful hotel ! 
It's at it's nicest around Christmas time - the atmosphere is fantastic !
The food I would only rate 4/4.5 stars though, I have had better.
I would most definitely go back again though !",4,2013,01,12
217,Best Christmas ever :-),"My family travelled to Ireland to celebrate Christmas 2012.  We had booked 2 rooms - king for my husband and I, and a double for our teenage daughter and son.  We had asked for an early check in which they tried to accomodate us with as we arrived on an early am flight from the US.  While waiting for our room we toured the hotel, and were given a tour of the spa/pool/fitness areas.  The setting for the hotel is wonderful as was the experience.  The rooms were very spacious and comfortable, no detail left behind.  The decorations for Christmas were unforgettable, especially the huge gingerbread house in the lobby.  We ate several times in the Sugar Loaf, had breakfast at the Gordon Ramsey every day, lunch at McGills one day and dinner in the Grand Ballroom for Christmas day.  The staff made our stay such a wonderful experience, with their friendly, welcoming service.  I didn't even feel like I was in a hotel, more like an extendded family.  Thank you everyone at the Ritz Carlton Powerscourt for a very memorable Christmas.",5,2013,01,08
217,Heavenly Luxury Just South of Dublin,"You know when you enter the suite and have to touch a digital screen to turn on the lights and open the drapes, when your suite is bigger than you apartment, and when the bed has more feathers than Big Bird that you have come to the Ritz.  When my friends and I booked this hotel through a package with Groupon Getaways, we doubted that things would be as nice as promised.  Happily, we were wrong!  We got to spend an entire week here, between Christmas and New Year's.  From the gingerbread-smelling lobby (because of the lifesize gingerbread house) to the super sweet spa, the Ritz lives up to its brand promise.  The staff--impeccable; the room--gorgeous; the location--gorgeous.  We didn't mind the short drive to Dublin or even shorter drive to the commuter train Luas.  The village of Enniskerry, must a mile down the hill, was also charming and fun.  Highly recommend.",5,2013,01,08
217,"Excellent Hotel, Marvellous Staff, Ideal Location","We had looked at staying at the Ritz Wicklow back in 2009, but opted to stay in Dublin City, I am so glad that after 3 years we finally decided to visit and enjoy this fantastic hotel. Every staff member works hard and is extremely efficient and helpful. The suites are very large and expansive, featuring a huge wardrobe space and opulent marble bathroom with deep soaking tub. 

We stayed for leisure and made a visit to the Spa, which was very quiter when I visited and it was just myself and 2 other guests, I had been afraid of it being very busy after reading some reviews, however this was not the case. We also enjoyed a golf buggy trip around the estate,which was excellent value for money at around 30 euro for 4 hours and allowed us to see lots of the resort.",5,2013,01,07
217,"Great hotel, fabulous food and friendly staff","We stayed five nights at this hotel. When we first arrived, the man at the reception desk told me we'd been upgraded... we got a corner room with distinct living and bedroom areas and, of course, the incredible bathroom (with a TV in the mirror, though we never used it -- great tub, though, and shower). 
The staff were very friendly and interesting to talk to... they came from a variety of countries -- Mexico, Ecuador, Ireland (of course), Turkey, etc., and were all willing to chat and offer help where they could. The concierge also was helpful. Mainly I liked the people who worked the front desk -- they were willing to help however they could, whether calling around to restaurants to find out who served boxties (Gallagher's Boxty House in Dublin!) or answering my many questions. They even remembered us enough to ask how our day was and specific questions about what we had said we would be doing that morning.
The food, for what we had, was very good. We ate room service one night, which was very good, and there was a chocolate dessert that I wish I could have right now. The pot pie was more like a soup, but we figured it was just a cultural difference. The breakfast in the restaurant on the third floor was buffet style and had some traditional offerings, such as fruit and pastries, but also offered smoked salmon, Irish porridge, fresh bread and local yogurts, so that was very good, and they allowed us to take a few extra pastries for the car since we were driving so much. I would say my least favorite experience with the food there was McGills... it was VERY busy, the woman said they were going to stop serving food at 9, but the board outside said 10, and the food was decent but not exceptional. It may have just been an off night, but we didn't end up going there again.
There is a courtesy car that you can request to take you the four minute drive into Enniskerry Village, where you can go to one of two pubs or an Italian restaurant we didn't try. We did end up eating at Mac's Lounge (the better of the two pubs) and would definitely recommend it if you want to have some beef and guinness stew. I hear you could walk back to the hotel, but there are very few lights and if you don't know where you're going, it'd be easy to get lost.
I wish I could speak more about the grounds, but we were out before sunup and back after sundown every day, but the inside of the building was beautifully maintained and since we were there during the holidays, beautifully decorated for the holiday season.
I definitely would travel here again and hope I get a chance to!",5,2013,01,06
217,"Beautiful property, fantastic location, nice people!","My wife and I spent four nights at this wonderful Ritz Carlton property. The employees were from over 50 different countries, and all were delightful, bringing their unique experiences from around the world. This is a great place to relax! The gardens were gorgeous. We would love to come back! The people of Ireland are wonderful, and most accomodating. Dublin is close by...Avoid the Guiness tour, but the Viking tour is a blast!",5,2013,01,05
217,worthy of the 5 star rating,"my girlfriend and i stayed here for two nights as our Xmas present to each other. We booked the 1 bed suite and did not know what to expect, i dont even know where to start. the doorway had two entrances (one for your main living area and one for your kitchen) thats right i said kitchen. this room had a huge living area along with a kitchen. the bedroom was the same size on the other half of the room, complete with walk in wardrobe and bathroom with tv built into the mirror. really an ideal place for a couples retreat. unfortunately i left it too late on NYE weekend to arrange a treatment for myself but my girlfriend did and had a great relaxing salt scrub. 
the hotel itself is great and the staff very helpful. we had lunch in mcgills while watching the sport. for dinner we decided to taxi upto Jonnie Foxes pub in glencullen only 18.00 flat rate in a taxi and had a good night of live music and traditional irish feast. on the second night we decided to take advantage of our room and had room service which was great. there is also a romantic turn down package available in the room which we only decided against at the last minute. we did walk the grounds also and the pwerscourt gardens and river walk are both worth a trip. these are all within waling ditance of the hotel and the concierge will assist with passes for the river walk. the powerscourt gardens can be paid on entrance. Also worth a trip is the powerscourt waterfall. this is not walking distance away but the hotel again will assist with getting you there. 
i would highly recomend this hotel to all visitors both home and abroad.",5,2013,01,04
217,Disappointing.......Not What I Was Expecting,"I have just returned from a two night stay at this hotel. If I have never been to a five star hotel before, i would probably have given the Ritz Carlton in Powerscourt a five star review, but I have and this hotel does not warrant or deserve a five star rating.

Arrival/Check-In: On arrival, the drive through the powerscourt grounds is lovely as you approach the hotel. The outside of the hotel was nothing special, quiet dreary actually. We managed to secure an early check-in which was nice as we had spa treatments booked. Check-in felt rushed and did not ease you into your arrival at the hotel. I had never been to the Ritz-Carlton before and we did not get a tour or talk about the hotel. We were just pointed in the direction of the lifts. Once our bags were delivered to the room, we were again given a very rushed intro to the room and how to use the touch screen pads. I understand that they are busy but to stay in any Ritz-Carlton isn't cheap and they don't reduce their prices during busy periods so service standards should not slip but unfortunately during our stay that's what happened.

Room Type: We checked into a Mountain view suite with two queen beds. The view of the sugar loaf is truly amazing. The room was the best bit about this hotel. It had a separate bedroom and sitting room. Bathroom was nice but the pressure in the shower was poor. It was in the small details in the room where you notice that the Ritz-Carlton is not five star hotel. There were no robes or slippers in the room and very few toiletries in the bathroom. This may not seem like a massive issue but you should not have to ask for these items especially in a five star hotel. We also had to follow the maid out to ask to turn down the beds during the turn-down service.

ESPA: On the website, the spa promises to immerse you in relaxation at their rejuvenating luxury spa. I would not describe this spa as luxury. The treatments were actually very nice and can't be faulted but again it was the check-in that felt rushed. We did not get a tour of the changing rooms, pool area or the thermal suite. I had to again ask our therapist if that was where the pool was. This spa really falls down in its surroundings. I have previously been to the ESPA in the Europe Hotel, Killarney which was immaculate in comparison to this place. You only got one towel. There were no spare towels in the thermal areas either upstairs or downstairs. Again we had to go out and tell staff about the fact that there were no towels. I have been to quiet a few spas where this is not an issue, new towels, toiletries, robes, slippers all appear by magic, but here that's not the case. The deck of the main pool was very untidy, with no towels and used glasses left everywhere. My sister actually said that she'd love to get out the pool to give the desk a good clean, not exactly what you should be thinking when you are in a five star property. In the thermal suites both upstairs and downstairs, again no towels and basket overflowing with used towels. On occasion while in the female changing rooms, a lady in a suit came apologizing for the heaps of used towels, but all she said was that they were busy! Hardly an excuse in such a property. Again there was no shampoo or conditioner in the shower I was in. Staff couldn't have cared less about the fact there were no towels or shampoo or conditioner when informed.

Breakfast: This was an absolute disaster on both mornings. When I check into hotels, I always look forward to breakfast. Here it was not at all nice. On the first morning, we had a slight wait which I didn't mind. We were shown to our table and told that we should go to the buffet section and on our return our table would be ready. The buffet section is very small and the selection was not great. There was no water, no glasses and no smaller side plates. We got no intro to the buffet. To make things worse when we came back to our table, people were sitting at our table. When I told a member of staff, again they did not really care. This is the last thing I expected at this hotel. We were moved to a small room that seemed like a through way for staff. My sister had to return her Eggs benedict as they were not cooked correctly. This is the first time we have ever had to return any food in any hotel. When we returned it, again staff did not really care. I would have at least expected a query as to why we had returned the dish, I'd assume that it does happen regularly. On the second morning, they had plenty of glasses and plates. We again had to ask for cups for our tea and cutlery. Just not a very pleasant experience and last thing I expected. I've been lesser hotels that deal with breakfast more effectively.

Gordan Ramsey Restaurant: This was actually really nice. Service was great and food was lovely. There do have a vegetarian menu but you have to ask for it separately.

Comment/Feedback Cards: I completed feedback cards in both the spa and in the room. Just a small note, they do not have boxes or places to put the cards, which is strange. It's as if they don't really want your feedback.

Check-Out: On check out, we explained all of the above to the receptionist, Kate. She was the first member of staff that we met during our stay that seemed to want to help and listen, a bit late as we were checking out. She managed to get a nominal amount taken from the bill. This should not have had to happened in the first place. During our whole stay, we kept having to ask for everything. I now realise that true 5 star hotels, anticipate your needs and have everything in place without having to ask. The Ritz-Carlton does not meet this requirement.

This hotel just does not do busy. This is unacceptable when you consider what you are asked to pay for their services. Maybe if you go on an off peak time, service and standards would be perfectly fine. However, we didn't and experienced the above. I would not return to the Ritz-Carlton again. I hope others have a better experience than we did.

If you are looking for better hotels, try The Merrion in Dublin or Monart in Wexford.",3,2013,01,04
217,Beautiful hotel,"Beautiful hotel and surroundings. If going make sure to pay a visit to Powerscourt. I stayed in a suite and it was very spacious, nice touch of macaroons on arrival. I saw a standard room also, again nice and spacious with a dressing area. Found the pillows very uncomfortable, very high, would be nice to see a pillow menu. Had the Gordon Ramsey dining experience, the food was excellent.  All the staff were very friendly. Breakfast the next morning was well organised and plenty of choice, they have a chef there making fresh omelettes. The hotel lacks an area to have a drink. The hours that the wine bar operates as outlined in guest information are very odd, so we headed to the Sugar Loaf lounge for a pre dinner drink. We were lucky enough to get a seat as we were told all table were booked for dinner, I found that odd for a lounge area, and we saw people being turned away who were just looking for a drink. There was a strong smell of food, like a carvery, and this would put me off having a drink there. After dinner we went to the Irish pub. I honestly can't understand the thinking behind having this such a hotel. It's dark and dingy,uncomfortable seating, and was quite cold, and the diddly eye music?? Perhaps aimed towards their american clientèle. The hotel is lacking a good bar/lounge just to have a drink in.",4,2013,01,04
217,Wonderful experience!,"Beautiful grounds, spacious rooms and the Ritz hospitality you expect. Concierge was awesome and made one fabulous restaurant recommendation after another. My only complaint was the food and times that food was offered was terrible.  Way too expensive and very mediocre. Nothing to eat between 11-12 and one skimpy over-priced choice for lunch.  Very glad we had a car to drive and eat offsite. ",4,2013,01,02
217,5 star and then some,"I brought my daughter here for her birthday,she wanted a glass of champagne in the Ritz. I had intended to go to the bar but it did not open until 2. The ladies serving in reception said it would be no problem and promptly served with champagne and coffee.I mentioned it was my daughters birthday.A few minutes later the lady arrived back with a plate of hand made chocolates with ""Happy Birthday"" written in chocolate.
Although we were not staying there they made us feel like we had just come down from one of the suites. A real 5 star experience.
Well done guys and thank you.",5,2013,01,02
217,10th wedding anniversary,"I have stayed in 5 stars world-wide - this was my best experience.
We mentioned our wedding anniversary and got an upgrade.
Top class food.
And I played the West golf course. Fantastic condition for the time of year.",5,2012,12,30
217,Hotel in a stunning location though food did not quite match the location,"Hotel is in a really scenic location but overall I'd have to say I was a little disappointed. Primarily because I don't think the food is of five star standard. Had Christmas dinner last year in merrion and it was far better though as against that the rooms and leisure facilities at Ritz were better. 

",4,2012,12,27
217,Best of the best,"We stayed at the Ritz over Christmas. This is the third Ritz I have had the good fortune to stay in, and it is by far the most amazing hotel I have ever seen. The rooms are fabulous and huge, The common areas are luxurious. The food is spectacular. Most importantly, the service is perfect. We were constantly being asked did we need anything; were we having a nice time; etc. Anything you needed was catered to. This hotel is not a place to stay: it is a place to experience.",5,2012,12,27
217,Very luxurious,"I thought this was a wonderful hotel.  Our room was opulent, the staff were top notch, the grounds and area were beautiful.  The lobby areas are comfortable and spacious.  We had a lovely breakfast--food was well-prepared and the pastries were delicious.  Our room was very large and very elegantly appointed.  Everything was in excellent shape--nothing worn or even a little bit dirty.  The heating, cooling, draperies, etc are all controlled by an electronic panel.  The television in the bathroom is embedded in the mirror.  The spa is excellent.  The pool is large and very relaxing with the way the ceiling is lit.  The whirlpool allows you to recline in comfort.  The steam room is very hot with adjacent showers and cooling area (including a cold bucket to pour over your head).",5,2012,12,27
217,Wow - This is a really special hotel,"My wife and I spent a night at the Ritz-Carlton Powerscourt in April 2012. What a wonderful hotel, wonderful rooms, wonderful staff and delicious food. Just wish we had stayed longer.

Thanks for a lovely stay - we cant wait to come back!",5,2012,12,21
217,A fantastic treat if you can afford it,"Myself and my Fiance recently stayed here for the second time this year. I booked it as a surprise the first time for our engagement and the second time we got it as an engagenment present! Stayed in a mountain view suite the first time and a delux room the second time. The rooms are really plush and I loved the TV in the bathroom mirror. Watching golf while shaving...brilliant! We used the facilities each time and they never seem to be busy. The gym is excellent for a hotel gym. Not that gone on theblack swimming pool but that's just me. 

Pint's in McGill's are lovely as are the nuts and the staff are top notch and friendly. We ate in the sugar loaf lounge and Gordan Ramsey's. Both truely excellent as are the waiting staff. The time between courses is great as I hate having food shoved down my throat as is the case in a number of our so called top restaurants.

Took the walk around the Powerscourt estate which is lovely and Enniskerry is a very nice village. All in all a top hotel and very relaxing place to be.",5,2012,12,19
217,Great Christmas Party Venue,"We had our Christmas party at Powerscourt, actually for the second time. Its such a great venue. Rooms were just spectacular, breakfast was also superb. The Ritz Carlton as always stands up to what I expect. 

For our Christmas party the food was great, except the fillet steak was so over cooked, especially for my husband who asked for his very rare. His was basically well done.",4,2012,12,19
217,5 Star Style,"This is most definitely a taste of luxury deep in the Wicklow Mountains. The hotel exceeded our expectations in every way possible. The room was enormous and the bed was comfort personified! Every member of staff was courteous, friendly and extremely helpful; 2 warm and welcoming fires in the lobby set the tone for our stay. The pool was totally unique in both the décor and atmosphere of relaxation. The dining experience was fantastic and the food in the bar and Sugar Loaf lounge was most memorable and enjoyable.",5,2012,12,17
217,seriously expensive but great,"Having stayed a number of times and being familiar with their rooms I thought I had seen it all but this time I was upgraded to a huge suite - I would actually call it an appartment as it even had a kitchen! It was absolutely amazing and made this particualr vist a joy. This hotel is the ultimate in luxury here in Ireland so you can expect to pay top price for food and drinks. Stunning location and wonderful views from the room and patio. They think of everything and have lots of little nice touches like chocolates greeting you on arrival and everything you could think of in the bathroom (shaving kit, dental kit, etc). The hotel was looking particularily beautiful as the Christmas decorations were up!
Everyone has to visit this hotel at least once in their life.",5,2012,12,16
217,Excellent End to Our Trip,"We are now spoiled for other hotels. Having stayed in a Best Western Plus our first night in the country, followed by four nights in B&Bs, this was the perfect way to top off our trip to Ireland.

To our surprise we were upgraded to a patio room.  The room was huge compared with any other hotels we've stayed, anywhere.  The walk-in closet alone was nearly as big as the bedroom portion of the Best Western Plus.

The bathroom was massive and featured a double vanity (with embedded TV), a soaking tub and separate closets for the rainforest shower and toilet.  The bedroom area was also huge, especially for Europe - but even by American standards - with two very large, very comfortable beds, a welcome treat after many nights on twin beds.  The electronic touchpad that controls lights, temperature and the curtains was an added bonus.

We ate an early dinner in the pub which was very reasonably priced and enjoyed our meals. We later had dessert at Gordon Ramsey's and found it excellent.  Traditional Irish music in the pub later that evening topped off our trip.

It would have been great to have had a chance to experience the spa but we ran out of time.  Every staff member we encountered was unfailingly polite and very pleasant to interact with.

The free wi-fi was great and it was so nice to have that when so many high-end hotels charge for it.

We hope to visit again next time we're in Ireland.",5,2012,12,11
217,Superb five star hotel,"This is my third trip to this ritz. The rooms are stunning, the most comfortable beds I have ever experienced. The location is magnificent with the most beautiful scenery. Superb food. Gordon Ramsay restaurant has improved since we were there in March. Fabulous Spa and treatments. And very good value for such luxury. If I had one minor quibble it would be that the reception staff should know thst you have been there before and as such you should be welcomed back . It's a tiny bit impersonal but overall superb. ",5,2012,12,11
217,Fantastic hotel in a beautiful setting,"Have just returned from a luxury wedding anniversary weekend at the Ritz Carlton, Powerscourt. We booked for two nights in a garden view suite with dinner booked on both nights, first night in the Sugar Loaf Lounge and the second in the Gordon Ramsey restaurant. We arrived early on the Friday and had a short wait before our room was ready. The hotel is beautiful and the reception area is very nice with lovely christmas decorations. We arrived at our room which was beautiful and huge. A very comfortable bed and fantastic amenities. The soaps, shampoo's etc were of the highest standard and beautiful. 

The remote pad to control the curtains, lighting, Air Con etc is a little gimmicky but I loved it. We ate in the sugar loaf restaurant and the food was nice (had the club sandwich) but very expensive (€18), I have had an equally as nice club sandwich for half the price. We also had lunch in McGill's  bar on the Saturday and it was very nice and better value for money. 

Breakfast was beautiful and plentiful with a great selection. The dinner in the Gordan Ramsey restaurant was the highlight, beautiful food served beautifully by excellent staff. This meal was included in the package and was well worth the price.

Overall a very enjoyable break, a couple of minor and I mean minor gripes - The hotel was way too warm, even with the air con switched off it was very warm in the rooms. I love my coffee and it was very nice but was always hovering at warm, not once did I get a hot cup of coffee. It is a 5 star hotel and guaranteed not to be cheap but the price of the drinks was quite expensive, €7.20 for a bottle of Erdinger, cocktails at about €17, soft drinks at €4.50 etc.  

Overall a great (not a cheap) stay but worth the money for our anniversary splurge. The staff very very friendly and attentive, nothing was too much trouble. Would love to go back and very family orientated from what we could see....may bring the kids next time!",4,2012,12,10
217,Beautiful Hotel in A Beautiful Settting But the Devil Is In The Details,"No question about it, the Ritz at Powerscourt is a gorgeous hotel in one of the most beautiful locations in the world. The scenic mountans, the rolling hills, the natural setting - all magnificent. The hotel's service was very, very good. They realize their job is to attend to the needs of their hotel guests and they do that very well. The rooms we stayed in (two different ones on two separate stays) were clean, comfortable and beautiful. The two hotel concierge we consulted were knowledgeable and very helpful. The workout facility was fabulous. The food  and McGill's was as good as or better than any I've eaten at any hotel restaurant. But with all that said, I have to also mention some small details that were les than perfect and which should be better avoided by a hotel of this stature:
1. On one morning I opened a clean towel that had been delivered the day before and there were large, ugly brown stains on it. 
2. One day my coffee supply had not been restocked. 
3. The TV stopped working in one of the rooms.
4. The ice machines did not work on at least two floors.
5. I asked the hotel to ship a package and they went overboard in their efforts to comply -they shipped it from Ireland to US in one day which was great but the cost of doing that was outrageous and I was never consulted on the cost. A more judicious decision regarding shipping  time and cost was in order.

These are small things but they add up. At a Holiday Inn I might have overlooked them all. At a Ritz I cannot do that. Overall. I highly recommend the Ritz Powerscourt but they should also be aware that the devil is in the details.",4,2012,12,07
217,"Stunning location, Gordon Ramsay experience was excellent, room was lovely, pub was small, spa needs to try harder.","Recently stayed in this hotel with my partner for our anniversary. My partner had difficulties with our booking and ultimately the hotel upgraded us to an executive suite as a result. Had the Gordon Ramsay experience, then attended the spa for treatment the next day. 

The good:
The room was beautiful with a view of the lawns, the fountain, and the sugarloaf, on the 5th floor. 
The dinner was top notch, had the sirloin steak for 30euro which was done perfectly, the desserts were also very tasty and imaginative. Highly recommend.
The staff in the spa were very pleasant.
A happy anniversary complimentary dessert was delivered to out table.

The bad:
Trouble communicating with the hotel while securing the reservation.
The pub really is a bit pokey and lacklustre. The staff in the pub were pleasant, but its more the kind of pub you'd expect in a 3 star hotel.
Ordered tea (specified Barry's or Lyons) at the end of dinner, got a large pot with one Assam teabag, after ten minutes of stirring and waiting it was still watery so I had to ask for another teabag. Perhaps a tea selection would be an idea for diners.
The spa is more of a 4 star event, kids running around in the swimming pool, sauna hides the heating stones to put water on, windows in the male and female sections were dirty. 

Ultimately I found this a pleasant experience, with my main concerns being a disappointing bar for the evening, and a spa where the level of luxury would definitely be more of a 4 star hotel. I also think international travellers might expect more from a five star at these prices.

Also, would suggest a service where guests can be dropped into enniskerry or up to powerscourt gardens as an idea for improvement.

Finally, I accept that minibar prices are usually ruinous, but 55euro for a half bottle of non-descript champagne is taking the mick. It would actually be cheaper for me to take a taxi to the village, buy a whole bottle of decent bubbly, then bring it back to the room to enjoy. Maybe look at this issue also.",4,2012,12,02
217,Beautiful and Peaceful,"The Ritz-Carlton Powerscourt is a stunning hotel.  The rooms, service staff and overall property is everything the Ritz represents.  Set on a sprawling estate, this hotel offers a beautiful and peaceful get away.  Gordon Ramsey's restaurant was very good as well. Highly recommend this property.",5,2012,11,30
217,"Lovely hotel in a beautiful setting, a true escape from the city","i proposed to my partner at a weekend at this hotel and the staff were super helpful in making everything special.  the hotel itself is attractive and facilities and rooms are excellent, but what really sets this hotel apart is the setting in the grounds of powerscourt estate.  we went on the 'river walk' which is private to residents of the hotel (and visitors to the estate). the path is very suitable for walking in good clothes/shoes, although there are plenty of trails off-track if you want more of a ramble.

our only complaint with the room was that it didn't have any windows that could open to allow fresh air in at night, as we prefer the peace and quiet of having the AC turned off in the room.  we had to leave the balcony door ajar which wasn't ideal.

the gordon ramsey restaurant was an experience, best dinner ever.  breakfast was also excellent.  the friendly waiter handed me a bag of pastries to take away for the day!  definitely going back.",5,2012,11,30
217,"Lovely Hotel, Gordon Ramsey Restaurant is a disgrace","Our lovely stay here was some what spoiled by a shockingly bad meal in the on site Gordon Ramsey restaurant. Quick summary of which was a bland at best starter, a cold main and a chocolate and ice cream based desert which would struggle in comparison to a choc ice. The rest of the hotel is fantastic. Great rooms, beautiful setting and the Spa is second to none. So definitely visit just avoid Gordon. Unfortunately the only other option for dining is the restaurant in the lobby which while suitable for breakfast and lunch is not really somehwere I would go for dinner.",4,2012,11,28
217,Expensive ..but worth it,Had a great stay in this hotel. Staff were very nice and helpful . The rooms are huge compared to most hotels. Spa and swimming pool top quality. The rooms however are fairly expensive  as are the restaurants . Well worth a short stay though as a once off treat.,4,2012,11,27
217,Amazing Amazing Amazing,"Just came home from what can only be described as THE best hotel I have ever stayed in. The service amazing, the room (we had a romantic suite) amazing. The staff were amazing! We were looked really really well! The food was amazing, we had our breakfast lunch and Dinner (Gordon Ramsey) there! To me it was reasonable! The Gordon Ramsey Restaurant was out of this world all the staff were very attentive, I couldnt even pour myself a glass of water without someone coming over asking ""may I pour that for you madam"" They knew it was our anniversary and sent us a bottle of wine chocolates roses petals from the door to our bed!  Gave us a special cake with Happy Anniversary on it in chocolate, and a personalized card again marking our anniversary. 

it was amazing, will be going there again very soon! 

*****One thing to mention, I noticed some people feel the food was expensive its not really for Irish standards I found the prices very reasonable especial for the fact its a Ritz hotel! In Ireland you would on average in an average restaurant would spend minimum of E100 for 3 courses for  two people inc a bottle of wine - just thought I would say that as I understand in some countries eating out is really really cheap but in this country not as much.",5,2012,11,25
217,A really special place.,"Located on the Powerscourt Estate this is a fantastic hotel. There is lots to do if you are interested in gardens, walking, hiking, picnics, golf etc. The Gordon Ramsey restaurant is excellent but the hotel's sugar loaf restaurant in the lobby is also top class. The staff here are great. Very polite and helpful.",5,2012,11,25
217,Luxury in a great setting!,"Spent the Thanksgiving weekend with my family here and met with good friends for drinks and dinner.
Great place to enjoy, relax, meet and dine!
I travel GE world and can attest to this hotel having phantastic suites on the 6th floor!
Very friendly staff!
We will come back!",5,2012,11,25
217,Expected more,"Stayed here for a night stay. Check in was quick and easy. Was shown to my room which was lovely. Had dinner in Gordon Ramsey restaurant, food was lovely but service was just ok. Missing cutlery as had none to eat main course , asked server for some  and she walked off and served another 2 tables. Breakfast the next morning was nice, good selection but if you did not want something from buffet you had to pay. Expected this to be included in the price of the room. Got 2 wake up calls that I had not ordered, was annoyed and when I told them I did not ask for them I got ah ok.... Not good enough. Pool area is nice and large, nice area except they need to look under the loungers and clean as you can see under them wen you are in the pool. Check out was quick due to the fact they had put my bill on another companies account, explained this was not to happen so took quite a time to fix. Again told about the wake up calls and also the constant flushing of the toilet at night, response from receptionist "" that would be quite annoying all right"" this is not what one would except from a ritz Carlton hotel. Overall an ok stay, would have expected more from a 5 star hotel.",3,2012,11,25
217,Fantastic weekend,"My wife and I took her father for his 60th birthday. We had a fantastic time, the hotel has 5*+ facilities, the suites are some of the best we have stayed in and the staff all seem to go the extra mile. I have travelled all over the world and this is one of my favourite places to go for a great de-stress weekend. Less than an hour from London on a flight, less than an hour from Dublin in the car and you feel a million miles away.",5,2012,11,24
217,A real Gem -Excellent hotel and food services,"This is a very luxurious property with great service. I would recommend it highly. We stayed on an Aer Lingus Travel package so not sure what our room rate was. I emailed the hotel and asked for an early check in which the hotel was able to grant. The room was huge, had to be 500 sq feet, a luxury in Europe. 
The bathroom was the size of a bedroom in the US. Marble, jetted tub, large sink area with a TV in the mirror and speakers in the ceiling. 
A separate toilet area and nice large shower area with rain shower head. There is a lighted makeup mirror and a hairdryer in the medicine cabinets. Robes and thick towels and assorted toiletries supplied.
The closet was again huge, walk in with cabinets for clothes, drawers, luggage storage and a mirror, safe and men's coat/pants rack.
The bedroom had very comfortable beds, a seating area, desk. Windows were foor to ceiling with electronic drape closing on a touch pad at the nightstand. Lights, night light, do not disturb were all electronic from bed and door. The room was very clean.
Only suggestion is more lights or higher wattage bulbs.
We ordered room service and ate in the restaurants, prices were fair.
We ordered room service on night at 1am. The menu at that time is limited. The operator said she would check with the chef on scones to accompany our tea. They called back and said he would make us some scones if we could wait 20 minutes. Our waitress appeared with a nice pot of tea and 1 dozen fresh and hot scones with the trimmings. Another night we got popcorn and toast at 2am, quick service and served on a beautiful table. Both nights the waitress was very professional and polite.
We had breakfast twice, full irish in the Gordon Ramsay restaurant which has lovely views of the grounds. You can order ala carte or full buffett. Full buffet was $20 euro and had a wide selection of items, all beautifully presented and labeled. Service a bit slow.
We had dinner twice in the Sugarloaf Lounge, food was good, selection was limited. It appeared that the menu changes daily. Service was a bit slow here too.
McGills menu is limited too and atmosphere OK.
Enniskerry is about 5 miles off the highway and the roads are a challenge. Winding, dark at night and not very wide. 
If you want to go into Dublin, the hotel will drop you in town for the 44 bus, which takes you on a short ride to Bray, where you can take the Dart train into the city. The train goes along the waterfront for a spectacular ride into Dublin. You can also park nearby at the Luas rail Carrickmines stop for 4 euro a day and take a ride for 2 roundtrip for around 10 euro right into St Stephens Green. Easy and don't have to fight traffic or find a place to park. Trains run often and you can pay in cash or credit card.
Next door is Powerscourt Estate with wonderful gardens and nice shopping and Cafe by Avoca Hand Weavers. We enjoyed several snacks here and good shopping for woolens and gift items. You can walk from the hotel. Avoca has several shpos around and we found the cafe food quite good and very reasonably priced. 
Enniskerry is a very sleepy town, only a few shops and small restaurants.
Few notes: gates to Powerscourt close at 9pm, ask the bellstaff how to get in after hours.
Parking is free for self park.
Free bikes available at hotel.
First night, put on DND so housekeepers won't wake you from your jet lagged stupor:)
View from the Sugarloaf Lounge is great and there are tables as well as sofas to relax and read and have a drink or tea.
We used GPS on google maps and trip advisor from airport to hotel, worked fine.
The Road Toll system is electronic, need to pay on line.",5,2012,11,24
217,Beautiful location and facilities with world class service!,"As one of our final nights of our 17 day honeymoon trip to Ireland, we treated ourselves to a night at The Ritz-Carlton. What a treat it was!!! The suite we stayed in was exquisite and every employee we encountered was genuinely interested in how they could be of assistance. The Espa was a wonderful way to unwind and steam room; a must visit. If you feel like being treated like royalty, you must visit The Ritz-Carlton, Powerscourt!",5,2012,11,23
217,Serious luxury comes at a price,"This place is very impressive... not cheap... not at all cheap.... but I've stayed in hotels all around the globe and this is the finest I've been in...  A total 5 star experience.  My room, was larger than many flats, 3 TV's, including one in the bathroom, a bed that was wider than it was long and several touch screens to control everything.  All the special stuff, and they still leave out a kettle plus coffee... which is always appreciated !

I just wish I'd had the time to explore the magnificent country side around the hotel.",5,2012,11,22
217,Frank & Susan's Ireland adventure,"Absolutely fabulous!  We had a beautiful suite for six days,  food was excellent, staff were the best, views, people, service,  What a wonderful vacation!!!!!  I could go on and on about the
trip to Ireland and especially the Ritz-Carlton.  Robbie, Mehmet, Maurice, Judit, you were all super to us and we will never forget you!  Hopefully we can return soon and see more of the beautiful country and enjoy the most unforgettable hotel experience ever.  We didn't get to go to the spa but next time it will be a must!  Gordon Ramsey's Restaurant met all our expectations as did McGill's Pub, all at the hotel.  The county of Wicklow is fabulous for scenic views and we really enjoyed the little village of Enniskerry.  Such great memories!",5,2012,11,21
217,Lovely,"One of THE nicest rooms we have ever stayed in. Staff was top notch, Friendly and everyone always says hello and inquires if they can assist you.
The spa experience was also one of the best anywhere. The swimming pool is reason enough to stay here, truly!",5,2012,11,18
217,My new favourite hotel!,"We stayed at the Ritz Carlton Powerscourt, County Wicklow, for 3 nights during the school holidays, 31st October to 3rd November 2012.  All I can say is - Wow!  It is a stunningly beautiful hotel throughout – it’s immaculate, spotless and plush! We had such a wonderful time and can’t wait to go back again as soon as possible!
We hadn’t stayed at a Ritz hotel before although had lunch at the Ritz New York a few years ago. I wanted to book somewhere fabulous for the family, a real treat for us all, and we certainly weren’t disappointed! We booked through the hotels owns website, and there was a special offer that kids were half price if sharing a room with parent(s), and if you stayed for 2 nights you got a 3rd night free! It was a no brainer, so we booked and counted the days to our arrival!
We arrived at 5pm on a Wednesday evening –it was Halloween night. We were greeted and welcomed very warmly, and the kids were treated like VIPs as soon as they set foot in the hotel! As it was Halloween night, the kids changed quickly into their costumes and were invited to Trick’or’Treat around the hotel – at the reception desk, the concierge room, and the kids club. They were delighted and got lots of goodies!
Our room was fabulous, it was huge. We had 2 double beds (extremely comfy!) but the room could easily have accommodated 3 more double beds, it was just so spacious! It was the “standard” (deluxe) room. All I can say is if that was a standard room I can only imagine what the upgrades and suites looked like! A porter brought our bags to the room and showed us the 5-star touches! -  there was a HD TV on/in the bathroom mirror, not integrated into it, but it actually was the mirror! (The kids were mesmerised, and I was fairly impressed myself!). All the lights, lamps, curtains, room service, ‘Do not disturb’ sign, housekeeping requests etc are on touch screen panels in the room. We had a walk in wardrobe with all the usual stuff, also a mini bar, tea/coffee facilities, huge TV, lovely desk with laptop socket & Wifi. The bathroom was huge with double vanity unit, fabulous make-up mirror, hairdryer, plentiful supply of toiletries etc, a power shower and a rainforest shower, huge bath, tons of white fluffy towels & luxurious bathrobes! We also requested kids’ bathrobes (available in pink or blue) which can be taken to the pool and spa – these need to be requested from housekeeping. Kids can use the spa & pool from 9-5pm each day; it was very busy and very noisy but it was during the school holidays so that was to be expected!
We got room service a few times. The kids had milk with a selection of homemade cookies for €4 each, or you can have a “night in” with a kids DVD movie, bean bags & popcorn for €20 per child. Hot meals were delivered in a heated trolley and well within the time promised when ordered. Room service costs an additional €5 per tray, which I thought was reasonable. 
Tip for parents! The wine list is lovely, but can be up to €11 for a small glass of wine, plus room service fee. However, each evening there is “sommelier’s choice” of red and white wine available for room service at just €5 per glass – it certainly didn’t disappoint and was great value!
Breakfast was served in the Gordon Ramsey restaurant – very contemporary design with incredible views of the gardens & The Sugar Loaf Mountain! Stunning scenery. Breakfast was absolutely delicious – Nothing was lying around for hours, but rather cooked in small batches and topped up every few minutes. We also ate in the Sugar loaf lounge twice, lovely wine list and kids menu available, reasonably priced too I thought.  We ate in the Italian restaurant (Emelias) in the nearby Enniskerry village on 2 evenings; the hotel offer free transportation to guests in the Ritz Range Rover, and the porters couldn’t have been more helpful. We were never waiting longer than 5 minutes to be taken down to the village or being collected to come back to the hotel.  
For a hotel that is only 5 years old and caters specifically to welcome young guests (“Ritz Kids”) the kids club is in a very strange place! Once you find the entrance to McGills bar, you have to go outside (door to the right of the bar entrance) – you have to go outdoors and down 2 flights of stairs to the kids club! As it was Halloween there were costumes which the kids could borrow to dress up, kids could do pumpkin carving or decorating, there was the option of playing fuse-ball, air hockey and table tennis (all free), arts & crafts area, games, toys, a mini library (& books could be borrowed and taken to your room), and every day @ 5pm was ‘movie time’ in a mini movie-theatre at the kids club with fresh popcorn (also free). Although there was a member of staff at the kids club during opening hours, parental supervision was essential as kids could not be signed in and left there unsupervised. Ritz kids club is only opne at weekends and during school holidays as far as I can remember.
All in all, I only have 2 regrets – 
1.	That I/we couldn’t stay longer!
2.	That I didn’t have time to have some Spa treatments... but there’s always next time! And I’ll make sure there’s a next time very soon!",5,2012,11,15
217,Now this is a great hotel!,"Now this is a great hotel. We went for a suite, and I have to say we were very impressed. The room was very spacious and finished to an extremely high specification. The views were breathtakingly beautiful with first perfectly manicured gardens and fountains, then trees in all their autumnal glory topped off by a distant range of mountains. The staff were all very friendly and made every effort to make you welcome without giving you the impression that they were angling for a tip. We ate in the restaurants at the hotel for breakfast and one dinner, and the food was beautifully presented and delicious. The staff, as in the rest of the hotel, were very friendly and attentive. The spa, you have to see it to believe it. If I was to make one criticism, it would be that the Ritz Carlton is so good, you are actually tempted to skip the sights of Dublin, and just languish there.",5,2012,11,13
217,lavish birthday & anniversary treat,"Just home after a one night stay in this fabulous hotel to celebrate our birthdays and 1st wedding anniversary which fall within the same week.  I chanced my arm and informed hotel of our triple celebration when booking online and to our delight we were informed upon check in that we had been upgraded to a superior suite.  A lovely letter of congratulations with sweets in our room awaited us.  What a lovely touch!
Our room and facilities/accessories were truly 5 star.  Our bed was enormous so so comfy the mattress just molds around you, I literally woke up in the same position that I fell asleep. 
Service, food and ambiance was superb.  Try the buttermilk fried chicken in McGills Bar and the berry compote at breakfast. 
To add to our lavish experience while reading the Sunday papers in the Sugarloaf lounge (enjoying our fluffy scones) we discovered we were sat next to a very famous actor who seemed to be enjoying a hassle free Sunday afternoon and from a little bit of eves dropping we learned this place is a regular for him!
We only live 45 mins from this hotel and will definitely return.... but for 2 nights next time!  Drinks are a little on the steep side but then again you are at The Ritz!",5,2012,11,12
217,Luxury in the countryside,"Stayed at the Ritz-Carlton for 2 nights with my family.  The hotel is fabulous, staff are friendly and the surrounding grounds and countryside are beautiful.  If the weather is kind, I would highly recommend borrowing the hotel bikes for an afternoon and pedal off to see the waterfall.  Only a couple of negative points really 1. Its pricey in the hotel restaurants and 2. there is only a limited choice of places to eat in the hotel.  To overcome this, its easy to pop into the nearby village if you just want a cheap and cheerful pub meal or pizza (there is a really good Italian restuarant which I will review separately).  Hotel was really good in posting-on some clothes that one of my sons left in his room - 5-star service!  Location is also quite good for a day trip to Dublin which is about 45 minutes away in the car.",5,2012,11,12
217,Fantastic Service,"Great room, wonderful location - but even better was the wonderful warm service of the staff - from the front desk, to the wait staff, to the bell desk, to the concierge.  The gardens next door are exquisite, even in inclement weather.",5,2012,11,11
217,Fabulous hotel - but would be nice not to have to pay for some things! (view),"The hotel setting is absolutely stunning, in the heartlands of Powerscourt with panoramic views. The staff are so helpful and personable - from porters, to reception staff, to bar staff to waiters. 
We got a ""standard"" room & it was amazing. A double door bathroom with a TV in the bath area, a separate rainfall shower, a toilet with it's own phone! The room had a hallway with a separate area for your wardrobe and an ironing area. The main room was spacious, with all fixtures accessed by remote control... lovely little touches all round including a hugely filled minibar and lots of lil sundries, bathrobes & slippers, magazines. And the beds - wow! ... a big king size piece of heaven with gorgeous pillows - I slept like a log! Ok the room had not got a view, but we went on plenty of walks & there is tons to see and do around the area. 
It really is 5 star service all the way - loved the room set up for our breakfast -in-bed and all for a mere cost of €5, which was excellent. 
Loved the McGill's pub - very Irish feel to it, fantastic food & great service. 

Now for how the hotel could improve..... 
1). All of the indoor areas in the hotel (outside your room) that had a view, came with a price - you could only access by visiting their resturants or area for afternoon tea etc. The hotel would benefit from having an indoor sitting-out area (aside from around the fireplaces/immediate entrance, where there are no views) or even an area you could stand/view from a large window, to enjoy the spectacular views, without a price. 
2). We stayed there for a business event (so availed of a group discount rate for our room). We were shocked to be advised on check-in/were left a note on our bed later on, to notify us that guests attending this business event were to be assigned breakfast back in the (viewless) ballroom where our event was held the previous night. This was very disappointing. Even at full capacity, the hotel should have been able to cater for all guests in their usual breakfast room. So it would suggest that our custom was not welcome. It's a pity becuase it was a very unwelcoming gesture (at odds with the hotel approach generally) and up to that point we had fully intended to return - but this approach left a very sour taste in our mouths. 
3). The price of drinks was pretty ridiculous, even by Irish standards - €11 for a vodlka & coke??!! And while it was a lovely touch to have a bottle of wine in the room.. it would have been nice to have had a choice of options, rather then pay €60 for the one they provided!",5,2012,11,11
217,"2nd visit, even better",This is the second time we stay here and it is even better than the first. This time we booked a suite. It was large and very comfortable. The whole staff was very hospitable and kind and they did it with pride and without any expectations. They just seem to enjoy they jobs. Can’t wait to go back again and again.,5,2012,11,09
217,OMG...!,"Stunning. My husband and I treated ourselves to a night here for our birthdays and as it was a treat we went for the mountain view suite.  Expensive, but really beautiful. The guy who took the booking over the phone was so cheerful and polite that we knew we were just going to love everything about this place. From there, each member of staff we came into contact with was friendly, professional and provided a very high standard of service. I brought my husbands birthday present but forgot to bring a card - the receptionist arranged for someone to go and get me one in the nearby village. I can be a bit picky, but I really loved this place. Definitely worth the treat!",5,2012,11,09
217,Gordon Ramsey Restaurant only,"This hotel looks great from the outside and has a lovely lobby. 

We at the Gordon Ramsey Restaurant which was really nice. The food was great. We did all feel that it wasnt perhaps hot enough, but they were kind enough to give us complimentary deserts. Would recommend.",5,2012,11,09
217,A real treat.,"My first experience of the Ritzs Carlton, powercourt was January 2012, my sister booked it for me as my graduation present. I had graduated  with a Masters In Tourism. Since January I have returned with friends to dine on more then one occasion. On Sunday the 4 th of November five of us dined in the sugar loaf for lunch. Three of us then purchased vouchers for friends and family to enjoy the excellent experience of the Ritzs Carlton five star treats.

217,Love it!!! Place to visit coming up to Christmas!,"This hotel is fab, everything about it. But at Christmas it is so so special and defo worth a visit. Even just to look at the Christmas trees. We did just that last year and spent a brilliant afternoon there. We walked the hotel, including downstairs just to look at the trees .Then we had afternoon tea which I recommend, but remember to book.  Its a lovely treat.  Or just a lovely place to just order off the menu or have a coffee. Sit in the lounger or foyer, and people watch all day. Its like somewhere you see in the movies, like New York at Christmas.",5,2012,11,05
217,Spa & Afternoon Tea,"If you want the perfect treat for yourself and a friend - the ESPN Spa in the Ritz Carlton is the place to go. I spent a relaxing morning in the Spa and had a facial and the use of all their facilities. The facial was by far the best I have experienced before. The ambiance, class and comfort of the treatment rooms were just brilliant. We went for the Sunday Soother package which was €95 pp. It was well worth it. We were so relaxed after our experience and could not fault it in any way.  After our time in the spa we went to have Afternoon Tea in the Sugar Loaf lounge. The views were stunning even in the dull rain outside. The food was scrumptious and we whiled away the afternoon chatting and drinking tea and a couple of glasses of wine to finish off. It was an excellent girly afternoon and we could not fault anything about our experience here.",5,2012,11,05
217,Relaxing,"We stayed here our last night and sadly had to get up early for the plane trip home. The suite was huge and all of the ammenities were so cool. Lovely location and everything was perfect I think I could spend a week there being pampered the location is great as well, being close to the Avoca Woolen Mills and they even have a store right on site.",5,2012,11,05
217,Relaxing place to stay......,"On arrival at the door way myself and husband were greeted by a member of staff to help us with our cases ... Check in was straight forward... Member of staff took our cases to the room and show us around the room ... We were showen how to operate the heating, curtains, t.vs etc.. The room was lovely...Staff couldn't do enough for us.... The surroundings of the hotel are so relaxing.. We had the two for three night package which is value for money... We didn't leave the hotel as we made use of facilities ,the spa was amazing... So relaxing.... Breakfast was great wide range of foods, yu need to be hungry for it!! We couldn't fault a thing about this hotel... Truly a five star hotel....
We would like thank the staff for amazing stay and we will be back...
Thank you:)

217,disappointing- fab exterior no substance,"I was really looking forward to a trip to this hotel but ended up disappointed. Nobody could argue that the appearance of the hotel is fabulous, grounds picturesque, rooms opulent and spa tranquil. That is it though.The spa was totally overpriced- there was no options for lunch, you had to buy a box costing 19 euro i think- i dont mind paying big money for an evening meal but not lunch with no options. Evening meal was worse i found the food bland and wine overpriced in fact I could not finish the meal. Breakfast was the most disappointing- it offered no options in the hot food department of what u would expect from a hotel of such callibre- its a  help yourself job with food sitting there and a very limited amount of food at that. I stayed in the savoy in limerick for half the price and offered eggs bendict, pncakes the lot but none of that here. It was utterly disappointing n overpriced.",2,2012,10,31
217,Relaxing stay at the Ritz Carlton,"My husband and I have just returned from the Ritz Carlton at Powerscourt.   Very friendly staff, value for money food and great surroundings. We will be back! If you wish to get away from it all this hotel provides the perfect backdrop. Family friendly and great for couples too.   You can walk around the estate if you wish or drive to Dundrum Shopping Centre if you wish to.  Either way a great time was had.  We even walked into Enniskerry itself which is a quaint little place with very friendly inhabitants.  The drive from Belfast to Powerscourt is very easy and it certainly encourages a return visit.  ",5,2012,10,30
217,Not so sure...,"We arrived on Sunday afternoon late, day before a Bank Holiday, to a hotel in utter turmoil. A large wedding party the day before had not checked out and the entire house was turning over. We were asked to wait to check in, which we did. Overwrought families with crying children littered every common space. The staff, overwhelmed and understaffed, were untrained in how to handle the chaos.
Two days later and we're still here, but now the boiler is out and the phones don't work. Does Ritz Carlton have any idea what is happening here?",3,2012,10,30
217,Amazing personal touchs,"My boyfriend proposed in Powerscourt gardens and had booked a room in the Ritz Carlton and a meal in the Gordon Ramsey restaurant as a surprise. All the staff we dealt with couldn't have been nicer. The hotel had upgraded us to a beautiful room with a view (I'm pretty sure it was a suite) We received a handwritten card of congratulations from the restaurant manager along with some chocolates and a note saying they were delighted to welcome us to the restaurant later that night.
After a delicious meal in the restaurant we got a little plate of bon bons and a lovely dessert plate with congratulations on your engagement written in chocolate on it. Every member of staff we had dealings with were so helpful and pleasant. My BF commented that the concierge was super helpful with helping him organise flowers to the room etc nothing was too much trouble.
The hotel made a special occasion very memorable!",5,2012,10,29
217,Over rated Hotel,"Just spent a number of days at this Hotel and must advise for the benefit of others that our experience was dreadful. No Porter staff on arrival, receptionist had to locate a trolley!. On shown to bedroom, established that the temperature was circa 14 degrees and we had to leave room to warm up, on return to the room some hours later the temperature in the room had not improved, then heat started and within a hour room was warmer, generally we found the temperature in the hotel very poor. On our second day our bedroom was not serviced and we had to contact reception at circa 7pm to have this carried out. Food in restaurant was cold and we had to queue every morning for breakfast. Service generally is very second rate and most definitely not five star, we would also question hotel cleanliness. Avoid.",1,2012,10,29
217,Fantastic!,"My fiance and I stayed here recently for a one night stay over a weekend and I could not fault this hotel. It was amazing from start to finish, I had really high expectations and was not disappointed. Check-in was very pleasant and efficient with an excellent porter who talked us through everything in the room. The room was huge and luxurious with all the 5* trimmings you'd expect. The bathroom is the nicest I've ever seen and we've stayed in some really fab places.
The spa is beautiful and we spent a lot longer than planned down in the pool area as it was so relaxing and hard to leave! We ate in the Sugar Loaf lounge for dinner and the food and service were both great. Breakfast was also lovely, had to wait a good 15 mins for a poached egg as it was very busy but there was plenty of other items to tempt me while I waited! 
At every point during our stay the staff were fantastic, extremely attentive without being overbearing. Can't wait to return, a very special stay!",5,2012,10,28
217,Excellent hotel in fabulous location,"We have just returned from 4 nights at the Ritz Carlton Powerscourt - we had a fabulous stay. We booked a suite which was huge, beautifully furnished and plenty of space for us and our teenage daughter. We ate in McGills Pub twice - food was good quality pub food - burgers, fish and chips etc. Breakfast was excellent - served in the Gordon Ramsay restaurant - would put it in the top 5 breakfast buffets we've eaten at in recent years (up there with Gleneagles). Concierge service was very helpful with reservations for dinner outside (we went to the hooley night at Johnny Fox's - great fun and to Emilia's Pizza restaurant in Enniskerry village nearby - very good) and for horse riding. 
We ate lunch at Poppy's in Enniskerry - great little place, with lovely food and friendly service. 
Spa at the Ritz was great - lovely pool and hamman. Only downside was there were no earphones in the gym - they had lost them all!
Hotel was very busy but we had no problems with service at all - staff very friendly. We would single out Michael at the front entrance and Robbie and his colleague (can't remember her name) on the concierge desk - very customer friendly and only too willing too help!
The hotel is in a fabulous location in the grounds of the Powerscourt estate with amazing views over Sugar Loaf mountain. We would recommend it and will certainly be returning!",5,2012,10,28
217,Beautiful,"My husband and I unfortunately spent only one night here to be nearer to Dublin Airport, but we will definitely be going back!  We stayed in Suite 702 and all I can say is that it was absolutely gorgeous.  The living area had a fireplace, office and dining space.  There was a half bath off the kitchen area.  The kitchen itself had plenty of space and included a built in coffee machine.  The bathroom was large, clean and had a small sauna room as well as a steam shower.  Pure luxury. Everything was impeccably clean and quiet - just like a Ritz Carlton should be.  Bravo to the staff also.  They were very attentive, kind and helpful. The grounds of the hotel and town of Enniskerry are beautiful.  Since we were only there for the night, we were unable to tour Powerscourt House, but hope to do that in the very near future!",5,2012,10,26
217,Wonderful weekend escape,"If you are looking for luxury and relaxation at the same time and place, go to Powerscourt.  The facility is only exceeded by the staff and service they offer.  Food and service were exceptional, as was the ambience at Gordon Ramsay's restaurant.  Ask . . . and it will be yours at this world class property!",5,2012,10,25
217,Average and overpriced,"Food cold at lunch, food cold at gordon ramseys restaurant, breakfast very pedestrian. Staff nice but no atmosphere in hotel or bar due to location of hotel in the middle of nowhere. Jack Daniels and diet coke €11.50 together with a twiddle de dee irish traditional music for our many american cousins. Take your custom somewhere else I know we will be. 
Rip off Ireland is still alive in Wicklow.",2,2012,10,25
217,Beautiful scenic resort,Tge staff is amazingly accomadating. You need something they handle it. Annie a waitress in the restaraunt is a wonderful woman with a great attitude. We spent 5 wonderful days.  There were NO let downs!,5,2012,10,19
217,It's great if you're after some peace and quiet,"After a few days of a hectic conference schedule in Dublin, I felt I was ready for a change of scenery and headed out to the Ritz-Carlton. It is a bit out of the way, but since I had no urgent reason to go into the city, that wasn't a problem.

The room was nicely proportioned and laid out with the exception of the closets which are near the door and a bit annoying to get to if you need something. The bathroom was great, there's this thng with a TV in the mirror which I found quite entertaining while I brushed my teeth. :-). There's no bathtub though which I didn't mind because I prefer showers.

Service was exceptional. The food was excellent. I have absolutely no complaints.

I guess it's important also to mention that I took time out to have dinner at the Gordon Ramsay restaurant. It was a nice experience.

I would definitely stay here again.",5,2012,10,15
217,Fabulous,"There is no doubt about it - this Hotel is absolutely fantastic.  Stayed here with my husband for a few days in September and it was the essence of comfort. The staff were excellent expecially the staff posted at the entrance.  There was nothing more they could have done for you.  The room was plush and I especially loved the TV in the mirror in the bathroom - what a novel idea.  The pool and spa were amazing - loved the stars on the pool floor.  We went to eat in the Gordon Ramsey restaurant in the hotel - the food was amazing here - well worth dining in.  We did the bicycle trip around the grounds - this is a must for guests as you can get to see the beautiful grounds around this Hotel at your own pace - even though 'coronary hill' nearly got the better of us coming back - but we made it none the less. Short walk into Enniskerry is lovely and the town itself is quaint and nice.  If you want a very relazing breakaway in the essence of comfort, this is the place to stay without a doubt.",5,2012,10,15
217,Nice holiday,"It's a truly relaxing place, especially the nice & huge gardens. Spacious room and they have a great staffs. You don't need to go out for food and drinks because they have a pub and a restaurant owned by Gordon Ramsay.",4,2012,10,15
217,Five star all the way!,"For a truly relaxing experience in the garden of Ireland, treat yourself to this hotel. Beautiful hotel, grounds, location, rooms, common areas. We thoroughly enjoyed our spa day and hanging in the hotel lobby and pub.We ventured out to Johnny Fox's one night and I highly recommend for a great time! The staff at this hotel are very professional, especially Ruiy, the front desk manager. No situation was problematic for him and he made us feel special and important!
I want to return!!",5,2012,10,13
217,WOW!,"This is a first-rate hotel for both business and tourist travellers.  It is 20 minutes from the center of Dublin (non-rushhour travel), but feels hundreds of miles away from the bustling city.  The hotel is immaculate, as are the huge grounds and gardens.  We were upgraded to a suite which was palatial (think electronic touch-screen control pads for everything from window blinds to lights, seperate powder bath, three tvs, desk, power adapter to 110v, etc.).  The drinks and food were a bit pricier than elsewhere, but not exhorbitantly so.  Maid service was provided multiple times during the day.  We saw some of the choices for the nicer hotels in town, and the comparison was not even close (although we did not see the rooms).  This should be your number one choice in Dublin...especially if you have a car.",5,2012,10,12
217,"Fabulous location, incredible staff",I was part of a team who organised a conference which took place in the Ritz Carlton in October 2012.  In the run up to the event the staff at the hotel were incredibly helpful and always at our disposal to discuss everything.  During the event they were even more helpful (if that's possible!)  The hotel itself is set in absolutely stunning surroundings with spectacular views.  We had visitors from all over the world staying at the hotel and I didn't hear any complaints at all.  Everyone was agreed that it was just beautiful.  The hotel itself is incredibly well run.  It is beautiful and the bedrooms are the most spacious of any hotel I have visited.  It truly is a treat to visit this hotel and I would recommend it to anyone.  When you are there also visit Powerscourt House and Gardens which are beautiful.,5,2012,10,12
217,A wonderful new hotel on the emerald isle,"A lovely weekend break hotel. Everything you would expect from the Ritz-Carlton group. The bathrooms were amazing, the rooms very impressive and clean, very comfy beds. The spa was great. the food was very good although i thought the bar menu was overpriced and not much variation for dietary needs. Stunning grounds and a fantastic golf course (i am told my my husband).",5,2012,10,12
217,The end of the rainbow hotel!,"Outstanding hotel in a fairy tale setting!  Sadly, I spent only one night in this hotel as part of a Living Social deal flying out of Boston.  I would have loved to have stayed for days on end ... it was truly the most magnificent hotel and setting one can imagine.  I have traveled a significant amount around Europe, staying in both elegant and budget hotels over the years.  This hotel far exceeded my expectations for even the Ritz-Carlton.  The staff was friendly, approachable, knowledgeable and helpful.  We were upgraded to a suite upon arrival and were astounded at how large and beautiful our room was, with more amenities than we knew what to do with.  We took a long walk along the river which was magnificent and dined in the Gordon Ramsay restaurant which was absolutely delicious.  Before dining we had drinks in the pub downstairs and enjoyed fun conversation with the bartender.  I could not have felt more comfortable in any hotel anywhere!",5,2012,10,10
217,Wonderful,"We spent seven nights and used the hotel as a base to travel around the area.  The grounds are magnificent and the service typically outstanding.  The  materials used in the hotel are of the ultimate quality.

A few minor issues:  The lighting  in the bedroom portion of our 'room' was too dim.  The TV remote has a curiously clumsy and slow system to change channels. 

That said, the owners and staff of this fine hotel are to be commended.",5,2012,10,09
217,What's not to like?,"This hotel is wonderful.  Not too far from Dublin, but nestled in the delightful town of Enniskerry.  You can take a bus into Dublin or spring for a cab.  The property is the home of the Powerscourt gardens which are fabulous.  Wonderful spa, but book early, they're quite busy.  Restaurants in Enniskerry are great, and the food at the hotel is exquisite.  The rooms, bathrooms and closets are huge and comfortable.  Really, it's expensive, but in this case you get what you pay for.",5,2012,10,09
217,6 stars on scale of 5,"This is the best hotel we've ever been in.  It is 5 years old and sets the standard for new 5 star hotels.  Fantastic decor, and rooms.  All the rooms had electronic touch control panel for everything - lights, curtains, etc.   The bathroom was huge, with a TV in the mirror over the sink.  It is a destination hotel, with an old manor house converted to shops and coffee shops, wonderful gardens; two golf courses; etc.  I only wish we'd stayed here longer.  
  Ate dinner at their Pub, as their restaurant was closed for a private party.  The Pub was good, though I wouldn't say outstanding.
  Of course everything is expensive.  This is a Ritz-Carlton.",5,2012,10,08
217,"pricey, but fantastic room and service","I stayed on points, otherwise wouldn't have considered this completely-decked-out luxury hotel. Our room was a fantastic suite, complete with electronic room controls and about 1000 feet of space. The hotel has about everything you would expect from a high-end hotel. The staff was excellent and always helpful.

We ate in the pub area due to our late arrival, and enjoyed our food, though wouldn't have normally considered it at the very high prices offered. (The second night, we were considering the Gordon Ramsey restaurant, but it's quite the budget buster, so we drove about 15 minutes to nearby Johnny Fox's restaurant, a reasonably priced and somewhat famous establishment.)

The only disappointment during our stay was a missing pawn (black) on the life-sized outdoor chess set. A fifteen-minute speed-chess game with these heavy pieces was quite the workout (the queen and king are not easily lifted).",5,2012,10,07
217,Put some effort into your coffee's,"I can't believe that this hotel is allowed to charge over 5 euros for a coffee when all they use is a press the button FRANKE coffee machine. I am familiar with this machine and it isn't great by any means. To have the neck to charge this much for a coffee, it should be made by hand with some care!",1,2012,10,06
217,Ritz Carlton True To Form,Gorgeous hotel with perfect rooms. Celebrating five years with outstanding service and the Ritz Carlton vibe. Great place to stay if you want to be close to Dublin (35 minutes) but completely isolated in beautiful country surroundings.,5,2012,10,06
217,Not worth the extraordinary cost,"Went here recently with my wife. It was a gift bought for a special birthday by her family.

The hotel itself is impressive. Service and greet very good and rooms nice. Gym area good and pool has nice night swimming feeling (although was very busy and noisy with kids and families about 6pm, quiet then at 7pm).

We both like food over anything but the trestaurant was a big disappoinment. Service started very good but actually got poor later at night when we struggled to order teas and coffees. We were on the ""ramsey experience"" so had an inclusive package. 

The overall food simply did not excite us. Portions were small but that's fine-the taste wasn't that super considering the prices.We saw the food in the bar area and it looked good and arguably was better value.

The ""pub"" is a hotel area converted into ""ye olde irish pub""  and lacks real character.

Breakfast had a good selection but there did seem to be a delay getting the eggs cooked up (common in even best hotels) and you had to wait whilst they were prepared (rather than going to your table and having them brought over).

My overall sense was that for the very high costs much better could be obtained (especially on the food front).

We did not use the spa.",2,2012,10,03
217,An anniversary to remember!,"We have just returned from celebrating our 23rd wedding anniversary at the Ritz Powerscourt and I have to say it was the most memorable anniversary ever because of how special we were made feel by the wonderful staff at the Ritz! As soon as we arrived at check in we were welcomed back and made feel like our custom was very much appreciated, (we had stayed a couple of years previously). We were congratulated on our anniversary and these good wishes really set the way for a wonderful evening.

We had booked a one bedroom classic suite and were given a really beautiful suite with a very spacious balcony overlooking the garden and fountain. We received a delicious plate of chocolates and a card from the management congratulating us on our anniversary. This was a lovely touch!

We had dinner in Gordon Ramsey and throughly enjoyed it! I had the lobster and my husband had the oysters and both were lovely starters. This was followed by a very refreshing mango and passion fruit sorbet. Then we had the sirlion steak and the salmon, again both good. To finish my husband went for the rasberry souffle and I had the tiramsu with coffee ice cream, which was probably the most delicious dessert I have ever had in any hotel or restaurant!! To finish we had coffee and petit fours. Fab!! We opted to have breakfast in our room the next morning and this was delivered on time and perfectly cooked.

We are delighted that we chose the Ritz for our anniversary treat. The staff are so nice and make you feel so special. It certainly wont be too long before we return! Thanks again to you all. I can definitely recommend the Ritz for that special occasion. You will be treated like royalty!",5,2012,10,03
217,Stunning property; cute town,"We had gotten an amazing deal to stay here for 6 days and it was beyond wonderful. The room was amazing with a cool gadget in the nightstand for closing/opening curtains, the lights, temperature, etc. The spa is wonderful...what a view from the tub and I had it all to myself! Inniskerry was adorable and fun to walk around. Lovely, lovely!",5,2012,10,03
217,"Hotel fabulous, restaurant not necessarily, if you are vegetarian","This hotel is absolutely five plus star in terms of the luxurious accommodation, bathroom, lobby, lounge areas, great staff.  The gardens and setting are magnificent. Our room was huge, with separate walk in robe, large sitting room, stunning marble bathroom with huge separate bath, big comfy beds multiple televisions, fingertip control of lighting and curtains and do not disturb indicator etc, homemade biscuits on arrival in the room, just superb.  So it was a big disappointment that for our large group dinner, the vegetarians (and there were a number of us) were, by virtue of the boring, unimaginative, minuscule offering, treated so contemptuously. Our entree was a quite plain green salad, undressed (until I asked for it to be dressed) and our main was a measly tea saucer sized portion of a rather ordinary risotto I could have whipped up in 10 minutes.  Meanwhile the omnivores were treated to a lovely scallop, mushroom and pea entree with a huge lamb rack, polenta, sundried tomato jus and rocket main.  To compare the two plates together,mwhich i did at several of the tables! Was really an embarassment.  Now I know the kitchen here is ""Gordon Ramsay"" who has a reputation as a vegetarian hater, but really when we are paying as much as everyone else I felt this was truly unacceptable.  When I dine out at fine dining I want to experience something that I don't have the time or imagination to make at home, which was clearly not the experience had here.  Nevertheless the hotel itself is truly gorgeous.",5,2012,10,02
217,Awesome Stay!!,"I had the best time at this hotel. My family and I went about 3 years ago for our first trip to Europe. Our family ages range from 50-4 so we had a lot of different ages in our group. The service was impeccable and the hotel itself beautiful. The front desk staff was very helpful and understanding as well as the rest of the staff at the hotel. The rooms were clean and the food was Delicious. The location of the hotel was set pretty far back from the main road, but that was the best part of it. Not many people knew about the hotel which made it even better. I would high recommend this hotel to anyone that loves the country side and enjoy great service!",5,2012,10,01
217,Most Amazing Room Ever!,"I haven't really stayed in any other Ritz-Carlton properties, so this could just be par for the course, but this was the most amazing hotel room I've ever slept in. The whole vibe felt like I was staying in a ritzy NYC penthouse. All of the lights, AC controls, and even the control of the blinds were controlled by touch screens located in the bedside stands which was so cool. 

Our room was spotlessly clean; the bathroom was HUGE with the best soaking tub AND a TV in the mirror. Again, just so cool. We also had an amazing view of the Wicklow Mountains!

Service was spectacular. Loved that they had a shuttle to the nearby town so we could get off property to eat (I just did not feel like eating in the hotel -- I think the food options were not so exciting.) The shuttle driver was so friendly and nice.

We didn't have a ton of time to explore the grounds, but the hotel is so close to Powerscourt with lots of options for lovely walks -- or bike rides with complimentary bike rentals!

Tip: for breakfast, we just headed to Powerscourt which was very close-by and had the best ever scone at the Avoca shop located in Powerscourt. I am still dreaming about those scones. :)

Note, that the location is a bit far from Dublin, so if you're looking to be close-by this is probably not for you.",5,2012,09,30
217,"Fab stay, second time around!","I won't go into too much detail, but we stayed here in sept 2011 and to be honest we were not happy with the service at all, anywhere. I emailed the hotel to let them know what we thought of our experience. Quite quickly, they responded perfectly, told us to let them know the next time we were going up to give them another chance.
We are so happy we did! From the moment we entered to the time we left, we could not have asked for better service, friendliness and attention to detail! Really good day last Saturday. And they were fully booked!! A wedding was on there as well which looked amazing!!
Well done to all the team!!",5,2012,09,24
217,Lovely hotel and spa - restaurant not all that,"Lovely room, absolutely huge, amazing spa on two levels, dinner was a bit of a disappointment, lobster starter was great, the rib eye steak was ok but  have had much better, plus the sides were bland and the raspberry dessert was extremely sour. We were on a deal so I didn't mind so much but would not have been pleased If I'd paid full price. 

Breakfast on the other hand was the best hotel breakfast I've had and I've travelled alot.",4,2012,09,24
217,1st Class from Start to Finish,"We stayed here for the weekend, and had an absolutely brilliant time. We were treated like royalty from the moment we stepped inside the door! The food, decor, etc was brilliant and we will definitely be back again!",5,2012,09,24
217,Three and a Half,"This was a reward night stay (one night - Saturday), which the hotel kindly upgraded to a garden-view suite upon arrival. Lovely room, beautifully appointed, friendly welcoming staff, fabulous scenery, superb looking spa and pool area. Our first visit to this particular hotel.... so far so good. 

Surprised there was no complimentary bottle of water in the room (not a huge deal I guess, and I didn't ask for any... but frankly I shouldn't have to). 

Surprised that the restaurant and lobby 'bistro' were booked out completely, so we ate in nearby Enniskerry village (more about that in a separate review). It's clearly my mistake for thinking that I would be able to eat dinner in the hotel without a reservation, and in fairness to the hotel they did call me the day before to see if I wanted to book something, but the only available time was simply too late in the evening for my wife and I. However we did manage to squeeze into the considerably sized restaurant the following morning for breakfast, which for me was somewhat (here's that word again) ""surprising"". Don't get me wrong, there is extensive range of food on offer, and it's all prepared to a very high standard - it just wasn't the dining experience I was expecting. I am comparing the breakfast to what is offered at the Sheen Falls Lodge or Dromoland Castle, both of whom provide a superior dining experience in my personal opinion. 

I am trying to be fair here, but for a 5 star resort expectations need to be met across the board, which on this occasion was simply not the case. Will I give the hotel another try? – of course, and I recommend you should too.",4,2012,09,23
217,Love this hotel- but recent experience NOT as good as past,"I stayed in this hotel 3 years ago and loved it... its the most beautiful hotel... I would never have expected the service to be as bad as it was this past time around.  I was disappointed in the room temperature, very hot, when it was 50 degrees outside. We asked three times to see if it could be fixed.  The concierge service did not give me a wake up call when I would ask for it, and thus, I ended up being late.  They were undependable for reservations at restaurants.  We asked for a cab to be called for an hour in advance and they never even called for it. So as long as you don't depend on them for service, the hotel itself AMAZING!  Side note- we complained to McGills pub and they gave us free drinks which was nice. The town nearby is even better! LOVE the Irish, don't love the staff at the Ritz.",4,2012,09,20
217,Awesome,"Really an awesome hotel! If you are looking for a great hotel experience, this is the place to go! Its not Dublin City City Center, but by car you need approx. 30 minutes to get there! And the hotel itself has all you new, great view, nice bar and spa-area! Not for partying but for having a chill-out and resting after a hard day of golf nearby ;-)",5,2012,09,19
217,I love this hotel but this stay was not as good as previous visits,"This is a beautiful property and I try to stay in it every time I go back to Ireland for holiday. I am confident they have the best hotel bedrooms in Ireland. The scenery is also lovely. I would advice getting a mountain view room. 
We had a very relaxing one night mini break and had a tremendous sleep. This was my shortest stay at the hotel. I have stayed up to a week before. 
I am hoping in our one day that we got unlucky with a few things - mainly service and the cleanliness of the property - on the latter Ive no doubt I'm more pernickity then most and would have a military housekeeper if I could! 
Service first. When I pulled up there was no one to help me with my luggage out of the car ( I arrived before my hubby), service in the sugar loaf bar was poor I'd to ask for a proseco twice and for condiments three times!! There was no one at the spa when I Checked out. (anOther note the girl who did my treatment was lovely but i don't know if I didn't rate her massage or the treatment itself - I was on and out of the shower twice and found it all very cold and not great). I asked for water at breakfast and was pointed to the buffet table to help myself which isn't a crime in service terms but it isnt the ritz 'my pleasure'. 
I found the table by my bed very dusty and didn't look like it had being cleaned for a while. I thought the steam room in the spa was very dirty - the main area
For steaming by the pool was closed for new parts so maybe the spa one was being over used. 
Anyway despite this I will go back and I'm hopeful this was a blip in what has otherwise being an excellent experience every other time. ",4,2012,09,18
217,A huge difference from staying at home,"We got time off from our twins and booked a holiday in Ireland. A few years back we stayed at Ritz-Carton in Doha and we booked in two nights at Powerscourt since we enjoyed our stay in Quatar so much.

I was quite excited to enter the hotel, and it was as luxurious as I had hoped for. We had not booked any dinner reservations and was told that the Gordon Ramsay restaurant was very popular and we decided to have dinner the first night in the lobby restaurant and day two in the more exclusive one. On the other hand, we had booked spa treatments for the morning after with a lunch in the spa.

The room, a suite with mountain view was enourmous, had a nice livingroom with a desk, sofa and a dining table. It was a large balcony with a nice view to a nearby mountain in the Wicklow mountains. A small toilet, a room for our baggage and a nice bedroom with a huge bed and a very nice bathroom with a tv in the mirror, a nice shower and bathtub. I must say that I would not preferred to have this type of interior design at home, but in a hotel like this, it was just what I had dreamed about.

Our first dinner was in the lobby area, a well composed menu of reasonally priced dishes, we ordered our food which was just superb and our waitress did her job well. The next day we had a spa suite with a two hour treatment and was enjoying the private jacuzzi before we had a very nice lunch. I would recommend you to download the Ritz-Carlton app - because you get some nice offers, some including longer treatments in the spa. The lunch was just 19 euro each and a very nice concept with four small dishes in a box.

The meal at Gordon Ramsay was unbelievable. We chose the tasting menu at approx 89 euro per person and 50 euro for a supplementing wine menu. The meal consisted of 8 dishes and they were so fresh, tasty and exclusive. I recommend that you consider this as an option, it is not usually this cheap to dine in such nice ambience with food of this calibre. I left a well deserved tip to the staff.

I agree with a few reviewers that the breakfast is nice, but not extraordinary - and I would look into that if I was the manager of the hotel. I think it is just a little extra effort that is needed to match the guests expectations. But, you get an Irish breakfast, and I have eaten those in other hotels and it would not compare to this.

The pub is quite nice, it does not have the same autentic style as a pub that you find all over Ireland - but is was live music and we enjoyed our drinks from a friendly staff.

So - if you a looking for a luxury treat, book a nice room at this hotel, it is really worth the investment. I am actually quite surprised at the few reviews from people not being satisfied. I believe that if you book a hotelrom at The Ritz Carlton, expect a bill that matches the place, and have an open mind about the stay, and you will have a stay of a lifetime.",5,2012,09,18
217,"WOW-Yes, but not the real Ireland.","Set in one of the most beautiful areas in Ireland is this incredibly decadent hotel.  It almost doesn't feel right.  The hotel is beautiful.  The technology is incredible.  However, I don't need a button to close my curtains-i don't have it at home and I don't need it at a hotel.  The bathroom with the TV inset in the mirror! I wish they put as much effort into their service.  The front desk staff and bellboys were great BUT the ""pub"" service was abysmal!  Not only were they slow, they were not at all friendly.  This was such a difference for us coming from some smaller hotels where the service was superb. I have also had better choice of ""pub"" food.   I was ready to overlook the horrible service-even though the Pub WAS not busy BUT breakfast the next morning was pretty much the same.   My husband waited over 30 minutes for his pancakes ordered off the menu.  I was a little surprised to see that the Gordon Ramsey's restaurant was turned into the buffet breakfast spot-with a sign covering the Gordon Ramsey's Powercourt Restaurant.  Shame on Gordon Ramsey-all his blustering about having top restaurants and how beautiful they need to be-this place was nothing spectacular.   In any case-buffet breakfast at the Ritz Carlton was nothing special-we had better at our other stays.   The place is beautiful-just not what Ireland is and if that's what you want then you will be amazed and awestruck by this hotel.  It may be a nice place for people in Ireland to vacation, but  if you are going to Ireland to experience the culture, this is NOT the place for you.  Actually I found this place and the Four Seasons in Dublin to be spectacular hotels-stuffy, glitzy and not the place for me.",3,2012,09,17
217,"Stunning, Excellent Service","We loved our stay at The Ritz Carlton Powerscourt! The rooms and views are absolutely stunning with breathtaking views. The rooms are very large, beautiful and have huge decks. We had a wonderful time sitting out on the deck with a glass of wine in hand.  

We loved McGills Pub! Ian, the bartender, made the BEST Lemon Drop Martinis. The beer was great also & my husband loved the cigars that were available. We also really enjoyed the food here. The vegetable lasagna was fabulous & we also enjoyed the onion rings and BLT sandwich.

Trish, the concierge, was excellent. She helped us rent 2 bikes and gave us passes to the river walk path....which we really enjoyed....a must for staying here. 

We also enjoyed the Powerscourt Gardens...a definite must see while you are here. We had lunch at Enniskerry one day, but really enjoyed the food at the Ritz much better.",5,2012,09,17
217,WOW!!!,"Booked this hotel as I was proposing to my girlfriend and wanted to make it a memorable occasion. Within a few days of making my reservation (which included a Deluxe Room, The Gordan Ramsay Experience and Buffet Breakfast) I was contacted by the Restaurant to choose a time for our meal. I mentioned that I would be proposing to my girlfriend earlier in the day and was there anything we could do to make the occasion extra special. Very kindly we were offered the Chef’s table which I refused on the basis that it looked more suitable to a large group. I was also offered rose petals to be placed on the table, a bottle of champagne along with a congratulations plate after desert. This was perfect!

We checked in a short while after getting engaged over lunch. Living just a short distance away we have never been into the hotel but immediately on entrance it was stunning. Going through the usual check in process the concierge enquired as to our plans for the day, I mentioned that we had just gotten engaged and would be celebrating for the rest of the afternoon, after a congratulations we were guided to our room by one of the bellboys who proceeded to show us where the Sugar Loaf lounge was located, the location of the bar, restaurant etc. He also gave us a quick tour of the room. The room itself was amazing. So large and well decorated this was already proving to have been an excellent choice for such an important day. 

Suitably impressed and after making our necessary calls to family and friends we wandered down to the lounge to meet a few people for coffee. On our return to the room we were greeted by a surprise plate of five chocolates with a note from the concierge again congratulating us on our engagement. What a nice touch and we were very impressed. Taking the afternoon to relax we began getting ready for our meal at the Gordan Ramsay Restaurant. I love my food and had been looking forward to this experience since making the booking 6 weeks earlier. While getting dressed the door bell chimed, a bellboy stood before us with a little gift hamper and another card, who from this time? The restaurant manager had sent us the hamper containing 3 macaroons and a note to say how much he was looking forward to welcoming us to the restaurant that evening! 

Already excited we decided to have a quick pre dinner drink in McGill’s Bar. On our arrival for dinner the Maitre D welcomed us and offered her congratulations on our engagement, something we were not tiring of on the day. Our table was by the window overlooking the gardens with a view of the Sugar Loaf in the distance. Glad I chose this table over the chef’s table as it was so intimate and with the rose petals adorning the table was extra special. Our champagne was brought shortly after and was delicious, It turned into the bottle that kept on giving during the evening meal. Fabio, the restaurant manager came to greet us once we had made our choice from the menu. We were feeling like the most important people in the hotel already and this was an added bonus. 

The food was nothing short of amazing! The bread, the starters, the main courses, the desserts, the liquors – all stunning and will be hard to beat as the best dining experience either of us have experienced. The atmosphere and intimate feel was perfect. Feeling emotionally drained after the day we had to retire early for the evening.

The following morning we both woke early feeling refreshed and peck-ish for breakfast. This time in the Sugar Loaf Lounge. Taking a quick shower and look through the morning paper we made our way for the buffet breakfast. This again was ideal as we are both people who like to sample and sample we did, from full Irish breakfast, to Danish pastries, to fruit and granola we enjoyed a delicious breakfast but all the while coming to the realisation that our time in this stunning hotel was creeping closer to an end.

We will definitely return, maybe to celebrate our anniversary or to pick up a wedding brochure. It was the added touches that I had no part in planning that made this experience so special and memorable and neither of us will forget it.",5,2012,09,17
217,The standard by which all other hotels need to be measured,"The quality of the hotel, the excellence of the staff and the sheer luxury of RItz Carlton Powerscourt never fail to amaze me. We have stayed here on several occasions with our small children and always feel refreshed, recharged and as though our short stay should never end. 

The staff never cease to go that extra step to accommodate any request.",5,2012,09,16
217,Excellent - Excellent all the way around - Wish we could have stayed longer,"We enjoyed our one night stay at the Powerscourt on Sunday night after the Notre Dame v Navy American Football Match.  We rented a car at the airport and drove the easy drive from Dublin down to Powerscourt.  The views are simply breathtaking.  I agree with numerous posts on this board, the staff is excellent and everyone of them has a smile on their face.  They are MORE than happy to help with even the smallest requests.  I hihgly recommend working with the staff to plan a picnic and use their bicycles to ride along the wonderful pathways. The food, the amazing pool, the hot tub, were all as perfect as you'd expect from a Ritz property.  The only drawback was the bed and pillows were extremely too soft in our room.  Outside of that, the room was awesome!

We also walked the golf course and Powerscourt Gardens next door and encourage anyone to do the same if able.  The walk was wonderful and helped burn off the terrific food from the restaurant at the hotel.",5,2012,09,09
217,Wonderful hotel,"Beautiful view and interior. The building looks a little odd and tired from the outside. Coming from staying at some of the finest castles and estates around Ireland, it looks a little commercial in comparison. None the less, very beautiful hotel. Especially like the chandeliers. Impeccable service from all staff. Very efficient and friendly. ",5,2012,09,09
217,SPA Outstanding and treatments pure bliss!!,"What an experience we had as day guests in the Spa. My only complaint is that I did not have enough treatments............ The staff are so attentive and could not do enough for you. A special mention for my therapist Fiona fantastic massage and so professional will defintely be back. I have been too many spas all over the country and this is defintely up with the best (as a qualified therapist myself my expectations are always high and the ESPA certainly lived up to my expectations!!! Fantastic... 

Highly recommend this spa for a fantastic girlie weekend!!",5,2012,09,09
217,5 Star rooms and 5 star service.,"The location of this hotel is fab! Views over the Wicklow mountains & fantastic walks in the grounds help burn off the calories from the very big breakfast.  My son and I stayed in a suite so had plenty of space.  The rooms are very clean, views amazing, decent size beds with plenty of pillows, great big showers and baths and decent coffee in the refreshment tray.  Breakfast is in the restaurant downstairs and this was very good. Pancakes were made for my son and they were delicious.  We had dinner in the Gordon Ramsey restaurant and enjoyed the food.  There was a wait between courses but only what you would normally get in any good restaurant. I agree with some other reviewers in that it lacks atmosphere but that could be due to the older age of the dinners and the downstairs location. The gym and spa was great- highly recommend. The pool tiles are black and the area dimly lit so it is perfect to chill out in and the pool is big! Spa was superb - book treatments they are worth it! Highly recommend the hotel and will return soon. PS Avoca is further along in the grounds- great place for lunch/picnic snacks.",5,2012,09,06
217,5 Star surroundings and Service,"A friend and I spent a weekend in August at the hotel, thanks to Marriott points. (Yay!) 

We took the bus from Dublin to Enniskerry, and asked at the pub to have the hotel car come pick us up. The driver was friendly and helpful, and we were at the hotel in just a few minutes.

As others have noted, the lobby is plush and comfortable, and the check in process quick and smooth. I noticed a set of portable steps pushed up to the check in desk, and an iPad set up for ""Ritz Kids"" check in - that was a warm touch for families. (And there were a lot staying that weekend!) 

You know how European hotel rooms can be tiny and cramped? Before arriving, we'd worried that we'd be on top of each other for two days. Well, that was so not an issue. We walked in and the first thing we saw was a large room to the right -- the closet! One side for hanging clothes and one side of shelves. A room safe, two plush robes, and a clothes butler in the corner were additional conveniences.

The bathroom was also large, with two sinks, a tub, and a rainfall shower. A fan went on when you closed the shower door! Nice. Do you know what else impressed me? A crystal ring holder on the shelf behind the sink. That little detail told me all about the hotel's attention to its guests. 

Beds were very comfortable, the tv had plenty of channels, and although we couldn't figure out how to turn on the light by the reading chair, we appreciated that it was there! LOL 

The view out the windows (that actually opened!) was fantastic. We had to force ourselves to not sit there all day to admire the hotel grounds and views beyond. 

We didn't eat at any of the hotel eateries except McGill's Pub - the arugula Ceasar salad is delicious! We ate it two nights in a row. The fish and chips there were just okay. The folks working in the pub were busy, but still very friendly. On our first night David took good care of us. He helpfully got the wine list from the ""wine bar"" and let us order from it. (We laughed about the wine bar that wasn't. Have to admit, that set up is a little odd.) Our second night it was Charlotte whose sweet smile and friendliness made the pub a good place to hang out. 

We did have dessert on Sunday night at Gordon Ramsey's restaurant... The profiteroles with mint ice cream were fabulous - but the real star was the very untraditional tiramisu. KILLER. 

This is a place I want to stay at again. Every single staffer had a smile and a friendly word for us. The room layout, view, and comfort level were marvelous. The grounds were beautifully kept, and it was an easy walk to Powerscourt Estate in one direction and Enniskerry in the other. We'd get a car next time to allow us to explore more. 

This hotel does 5 Star right.",5,2012,09,04
217,FANTASTIC HOTEL,"My wife and I stayed at this magnificent hotel from August 7, 2012 to August 10, 2012 and found the hotel to be excellent in all categories. The rooms are very big. The hotel personnel go out of their way to help you. The view is absolutely spectacular. The food is scrumptious. We love staying at the Ritz Carlton Hotels throughout the world and my wife and I would have to rate this Ritz Carlton as the second best Ritz Carlton that we have ever stayed at in the world. We wanted to visit Dublin. However, the Hotel and the surrounding area was so spectacular, we simply did not have time to visit Dublin. However, we will be back!@!!",5,2012,09,04
217,Attraction: a wonderful tea only-didn't stay over in the hotel,"You can book this hotel for tea for your group.  It is an impressive place built in a charming country setting.
We were taken to a large room (low ceiling, elegant decor)  and enjoyed the cucumber sandwiches, tandoori chicken and chutney wrap slices (like pinwheel sandwiches), roast beef on brioche sliders, scones with clotted cream and jelly (or butter).  Tea, coffee, choice of wines, or water were available. Following these came mini fruit tarts and a sort of flan on a shortbread crust which contained a raspberry gel.  
17 Americans enjoyed pretending to be elegant while being served by a Polish and a Hungarian waitress.  The maitre d'hotel was not Irish either!",5,2012,09,04
217,Promised more than it delivered....,"I stayed for one night late last year and while I must concur with the majority that it is a beautiful hotel in a stunning location, I had quibbles with certain fundamental aspects of it.

The welcome was warm and professionalism and check in was swift and efficient.  The imposing foyer with its high ceilings, chandeliers, plush sofas, marble floors and well dressed bellboys wheeling brass luggage carriers definately made an impact. Great first impression.

Our double room was large & extremely well appointed  - our view of the Sugarloaf Mountain left us in no doubt as to which county we were in, glorious Wicklow. The massive walk in closet had wow factor, the beds were probably the most comfortable I have slept in and the plush upholstery again indicated that we were in a room where no expense had been spared. So far, so 5 star.

We took afternoon tea in the busy back foyer, with it relaxing views of the gardens (and that ole Sugarloaf again).  Service was friendly and attentive in just the right measure and we enjoyed our treats. 

We didn't avail of the leisure centre or spa treatments so cannot comment on those.  What we did notice however was that in order to access them, one had to walk across the very large, busy foyer in one's robe & slippers in full view of other guests.  That was offputting for me, I would have felt too exposed. 

Dinner- which was going to be the highlight of our stay -  was booked for the Gordon Ramsay restaurant down a flight of stairs from the foyer and to cut a long story short, it was a disappointment.  The room itself was low ceilinged, drab and looked for all the world like one of those conservatory-esque eateries stuck on to the kind of suburban pub that does a good Sunday carvery. Albet a nice suburban pub. But after the opulence of the foyer and the huge sweeping exterior, we couldn't believe they'd locate the restaurant in such a cramped space, it felt a little claustrophic.  The food was tasty and nicely presented but nothing memorable.  It most definitely didn't not scream, nor did it even whisper,  'wow, we are dining at the altar of one of Britain's top chefs'. But after our fiasco in Dunbrody a few years ago, it wasn't that surprising - when so called celebrity chefs spread themselves as thinly as these chaps, only a fool would think they are actually in the kitchen cooking your dinner. I would say I've eaten just as well, if not better, in other restaurants that don't trumpet themselves with celebrity connections.  However, the waiter (Portuegese, if memory serves) was a delight - helpful, enthusiastic, charming and great fun. Which was just as well, as the other diners were a fairly muted bunch, no doubt over-awed at finding themselves eating in the Ritz Carlton....I couldn't help thinking there was an element of Emperor's New Clothes about it, that just because one was told this was a 5 star dining experience, everyone acted like it was.  Or maybe we just chose the only two dull starters and main courses on the menu that evening, who knows?
 
 

And therein lies the crux of my dissatisfaction with this hotel.  For all of the undeniable magnificence of its architecture, for all the undeniably 5 star comforts of its rooms, and the wonderfully helpful staff, it had - for me anyway - absolutely no atmosphere, and lacked real oomph.  There were no little nooks or crannies into which one could disappear with the Irish Times and an Irish Coffee, nor a cosier sitting area than the huge foyer in which to nurse a night cap.  We wanted to have a post prandial nightcap but as the bar was playing host to the afters of a fairly rowdy wedding party, it was a no go area for us.  So we went up to the foyer to order a drink from there (a la Shelbourne Hotel or any quality hotel we've ever been in).  No lounge service in the foyer, to our amazement.  Deserted.  My companion had to traipse back down the long and winding staircase to the rowdy bar, buy the drinks and carry them up to the (big, empty, etc) foyer....After a meal, that is hardly a relaxing end to one's evening.  It put us off having a second drink and we repaired to bed earlier than we may have liked. And sitting in a hotel foyer, people watching and chatting over a night cap, is one of my favourite things to do so I felt a bit short changed. 

Breakfast in our room next morning was delicious, could not fault a thing. We kept saying, wow, this is the Ritz Carlton....but for all of that, I wouldn't be in a hurry to go back.  It was, for all its bling, less than the sum of its parts.",3,2012,09,03
217,The best Hotel I have stayed in to date..and I travel  A LOT!,"The Ritz at Powerscourt is a newer hotel situated on the grounds of the Powerscourt Estate just outside Dublin.  It is truly one of the most beautiful settings in Ireland, with the gardens next door at the estate, a must see.  While I don't play golf, I understand the course is equally amazing.

The rooms are so beautiful and comfortable that when you get off a long flight, you first sink into the most heavenly bed and sleep the night away and wake up totally refreshed.  

I like to tell everyone; the Ritz was so delux that even our bags that their own room!.  A dressing room off the large bath, allows you to hang everything with ease and really spread out.

Having afternoon tea in the Hotel Lobby was a must every day if you could and dinner at one of several restaruants was always excellent.  The spa was also an wonderful experience.  Most of all the staff goes out of their way to make you feel special and appreciated.  On my second stay I was greeted by the manager, who welcomed me back and insisted he remembered me from my last stay.  Of course he didn't, but still they could almost make you believe that!

Powerscourt is an easy drive to almost anywhere near Dublin and was a great base for us to explore.  Everytime I go to Ireland, now I try to stay at least one night at the Powerscourt.   Truely Heaven on Earth.  M.L. Schmit",5,2012,08,31
217,Nothing to fault,"Stayed here for a weekend thanks to Ritz Carlton points so it was pretty much free which made it especially delightful! Superb welcome - it feels like they've got the red carpet out just for you :)
Beautfil rooms, in good condition. Service is impeccable - no request is too small. You can hire bikes  for free to ride around the area (beware: hilly!!!). 
There is a free pick-up service for the closest village so you can go to dinner in one of the nice restaurants there too. Lovely grounds and surrounding countryside.
Pool and jacuzzi were a good size and with lovely zen decoration, unfortunately sauna wasn't working when we were there.",5,2012,08,29
217,Indulgence!,"My family were privileged enough to spend one night here as part of a tour of Ireland sponsored by his employer. Where do I start?

I had to pinch myself to believe it was real. I have never stayed in such a beautiful hotel before in my life. The other hotels we stayed at in Ireland were stunning as well, but this was over the top. The lobby is spectacular. We had adjoining rooms to accommodate my three children. Our room had a separate living area with desk and sofas and television. There was also a television in our bedroom. Each of the bathrooms had a television screen inside the mirror. In between the adjoining rooms was a gigantic closet area with floor to ceiling cabinets. Our view was spectacular. We could see the human sized chess board and the spring. The hotel is surrounded by greenery.

I was able to visit the gym and my husband used the pool. Both are very nice.

My husband's work arranged for dinner at Gordon Ramsay's Powerscourt. That kind of food is not our cup of tea. Both my husband and I did not enjoy it, although it might be something that others like, and it seemed like the others in our group did. We spent hours waiting for each course and we both left dinner quite hungry.

We had to wake up early the next morning (2:00 am) to catch a flight to Rome. The concierge went above and beyond. He kept checking with the cab company to make sure they would reach the hotel with enough time for us to get to the airport, and provided bags of fruit and juice for our time at the airport. I kept the Ritz-Carlton gift bag that contained the goodies he gave us as a souvenir...I'm not sure I'll ever see the inside of a place like this again! Words escape me!",5,2012,08,29
217,Excellent food let down by very poor service!,"We ate at the Sugar Loaf restraunt on a Monday evening. The setting looking at the sugar loaf was picturesque. The food was excellent, the deserts in particular. The food was worth the price on the menu but the service was appalling! Drinks orders forgotten, had to ask for water, to have our table wiped, desert spoons to drink my soup with and the staff consistently leaned across me and my girlfriend when clearing and setting our table!!! Big let down!",3,2012,08,27
217,Top notch hotel,"I confirm all the positive comments below.  This hotel is the best I've stayed in any where in the world. I found it faultless & the staff exceptional. Try the 'chefs table"" inside Gordon Ramsey's restaurant.  It is a dining experience inside the kitchen watching the chefs at work.  Explore the tiny village of Eniskerry & swim in the hotel's inside pool - an experience all it's own.  I could go on & on, but will sumarise by describing this hotel as heaven on earth.",5,2012,08,25
217,Most Remarkable Ritz Property,"Of all the Ritz properties I have stayed at, this is the most remarkable of all. It is a beautiful hotel with incredibly tasteful decor throughout and within the rooms. We had a lovely suite complete with all the amenities one could want. There was even a TV in the bathroom mirror. It is also a very reasonably priced property. I'm sure there are quaint B&Bs. But for a hotel, this must be the best in Ireland. The service was always top notch. If you investigate close enough, they have complementary bike rentals, Samsung tablets, and umbrellas by the front door. The bikes were a perfect way to enjoy the surrounding Powerscourt Estate area. There is no better location for this purpose, and is in a great location to explore the Wicklow mountains. My only complaint is the Gordon Ramsay restaurant was mediocre at best. We are lucky to have exceptional dining options where we live, and unfortunately this just doesn't measure up. However, we did enjoy a couple pints of Guinness and traditional shepherd's pie at the hotel pub, which we thoroughly enjoyed. This is the perfect place to enjoy an aspect of Ireland away from its largest city.",5,2012,08,25
217,Best Staff in the World,This hotel is without a doubt the loveliest in all of Ireland.  You will be greeted by Krys at the front door and thus your journey of a thousand smiles begins.  His pleasant demeanor is so refreshing and a great way to begin and end your days while enjoying this luxurious hotel.  Benoit always makes our stay such a delightful experience and sees to it that we have not only a beautiful room but all the comforts of home.  Both he and Krys seem to treat each guest as though they were the only guests staying there.  The staff at the Ritz Powerscourt is what makes them a 5 star hotel and keeps the guests returning time and again.  The rooms are incredibly spacious with all the amenities one could ask for.  Enniskerry is a charming little town with a very lovely antique store and several small restaurants.  The people in the town are equally charming.  This is our fourth visit from the states.  What more can we say!,5,2012,08,21
217,Loved it here!,"This is a beautiful hotel and the service was impeccable.  We were able to check in early and were surprised to receive a wonderful upgraded room.  The rooms were spacious with wifi and all the amenities you would expect for this level of hotel.  We felt spoiled by the tv inside the mirror in the bathroom.

The staff was very helpful, especially the concierge.  She set up a bus tour, planned scenic walking routes, gave us water for our trip and even had a car ready to pick us up in town after a long day of sight seeing.

Take advantage of the breakfast included with your stay, it's fabulous!  Everything was fresh and delicious, I think I tried everything over the course of our 3 day stay.  If you're lucky the weather will cooperate and you can have your breakfast out on the patio with a view of the hills in the distance and the hotel water fountain just below you.

Food-wise our only lackluster review would be for the McGills bar.  We ate there one night and it was just okay.  It was not on the same level as everything else at the hotel.  

A short walking distance away is the Powerscourt House and Gardens.  Definitely worth a visit while you are right next door.  There are shops within the house including a well appointed cafe and an Avoca store.

For those that like walking, do the River Walk, just past Powerscourt Gardens.  It's paved (unless you wander off on one of the side trails that run along the water) and the many extremely old, large trees are a sight to see.  If you want to picnic or have a place to sit, plan on taking the right side tour when going down the main path, it has picnic tables along the trail.

Tips: let the hotel call for your taxi into Dublin.  They have a set flat rate and it's very reasonable.  Also, there are great package deals available on their website, some giving you a free day if you stay a certain amount of time.",5,2012,08,20
217,Excellent,"This was my second visit to this particular hotel. It is close enough to dublin to enjoy what the city has to offer whilst being situated in a beautiful estate.

The rooms are very well appointed, with up to date technology and free wi-fi.

The bathroom is one of my favourites out of any hotel I have stayed.

The choice for dining of course includes a Gordon Ramsey restaurant. The food was beautiful, flavours exceptional. Having visited a number of Gordon Ramsey restaurants it is what you would expect. The service however was not up to the standard I have seen before or would expect at this end of the dining market.

Overall, an excellent hotel which i can highly recommend.",5,2012,08,18
217,Comfortable place to start vacation,"We elected to spend our arrival and next night here to decompress, enjoy Spa and prepare to for 8 days of driving from place-to-place.  (We had both previously visited Dublin)  Super-comfortable and spacious rooms with top quality baths as expected at Ritz-Carlton.  McGill's Pub food was extremely good on two occasions.  Our choice not to eat breakfast or at Gordon Ramsey but rather preferred going down into Enniskerry small restaurants.  Enjoyed our stay but you have to understand this particular hotel's location and your reasoning to stay here.  Lovely walks along Powerscourt Avenue.  Nice day trip to Glendalough Monastic ruins or back into Dublin.",3,2012,08,16
217,Fabulous hotel,"Stayed here for two nights, booked a standard room but I think we got upgraded on arrival, the bedroom was amazing!! Very big room with large balcony and a glass wall. this hotel has all the mod cons, tv in bathroom, electric curtains, everything you could want. the grounds of the hotel were spectacular, def recommend going to the Powerscourt gardens. The only negative comment I have is I would like there to be more basic food choices on the lobby menu such as toasted sandwiches, etc. I did get for a toasted sandwich as it was available on the kids menu but I felt it wasn't up to five star standards, it wasnt very tasty and pretty basic. Also I would like if there was another restaurant in the hotel besides Gordon ramsays, you certainly couldn't afford to eat in it every night if you were staying for a week. That said, the bar food in the hotel was gorgeous, with a great atmosphere and fair prices. ( I was charged something like €4 when I asked for some coleslaw though which I thought was a bit steep, wouldn't really expect to be charged for this in other five star hotels). Breakfast was nice but I was very disappointed at having to make my own toast and be told I'd have to pay if I ordered waffles or pancakes even though my breakfast was included in my room rate. Otherwise my stay was fantastic, hotel was spotless and there is loads to do nearby- the waterfall, Johnny foxes, avoca, etc. Will return soon hopefully.",5,2012,08,13
217,Hated Leaving!,"We have just returned from a gifted weekend break in this hotel, and from moment we drove through the entrance we were wowed by everything.  The amazing facade of the hotel, the grounds, the foyer, the attentative, gracious and obliging staff all continued the wonderful experience.  We were upgraded to a suite with an incredible view over the waterfall in the grounds and the mountains.  As the olympics were very important to us, it helped to have 3 screens on which to view races. We dined in the Gordon Ramsey restaurant on Saturday night, dining out can be a problem for me as I'm coeliac but all of the staff were very aware and ensured that my dining experience was just as amazing as that of my husband. McGills Bar had a great atmosphere for pre dinner drinks and also served reasonably priced food!  We toured the grounds and the lovely garden centre and bought some lovely plants to remind us of the great weekend.  Enniskerry is a picturesque village, with great quirky boutiques, gift shops and lovely restaurants.  Well worth a visit.  We cant wait to return. Carole Walsh",5,2012,08,12
217,Great Place to Stay!!,"We had a wonderful week touring County Wicklow, visiting Sally Gap and relaxing. The concierge desk took great care of us. Many thanks to Robbie, Trish and Daniel!

The adjacent Powerscourt gardens are quite spectacular.",5,2012,08,11
217,"Wow, wow, wow","Just back today from a 3 night stay in this amazing hotel. From the second we arrived to the second we left we were treated to a real 5 star experience. We were greeted at the door by a friendly smiling doorman and shown to the check in desk. Despite arriving 3 hours earlier than the check in time of 3pm we were allowed to check into our room and our daughter also got to 'check in' herself at the special kids check in desk. We were upgraded to a mountain view suite which was absolutely amazing, with two bathrooms, kitchen, lounge, bedroom, walk in wardrobes, giant main bathroom with huge bath and shower and a wonderful patio area with great views over the Wicklow mountains. 

We made good use of the hotel facilities including the amazing pool and hot tub, borrowed the bikes to take a trip down to the lovely river walk and ate in all of the restaurants apart from Gordon Ramsay. Breakfast was great with a wide selection of delicious locally sourced food however a bit chaotic on our last day when we arrived in late at the same time as a wedding party! Tip: get in well before 10am! Staff are wonderful and really friendly and helpful - from the managers, doorman/concierge to the housekeeping staff- they all seem genuinely interested in making your stay the best it can be. 

The little things that made our daughter feel welcomed also made a huge difference during our stay - kids bathrobes and slippers, lollipops from staff at every turn, kids bikes and cycle helmets, marshmallows for kids to toast on the open fire in the bar, really well equipped games room and small play area outside with swings, slides, climbing walls etc- neatly tucked away so as not to disturb the other guests! Their little fingers also love being in charge of the touchscreen panels in the rooms to open and close the curtains and turn the lights on and off! 

Also nice little touches for the grown ups too, complimentary newspapers delivered to the room each morning, delicious chocolates and note in the room on arrival, complimentary water delivered to the room each evening with a handwritten weather report for the next day and a 10% discount for hotel guests in Avoca next door!!

Overall we had an amazing stay and will definitely be back. This is a wonderful hotel and very deserving of its 5 star rating. Also very good value for money if you consider all of the added extras you get on top of the price of a room for the night. 
",5,2012,08,10
217,Thank god for powers court,"Having travelled half way around the world to find a luxury, well serviced and not ludicrously expensive hotel, we arrived at the Ritz Powerscourt hotel, Ireland. Amazing suite, mountain view, beautifully decorated, clean, such friendly staff, incredible food and reasonable prices for height of luxury. You don't get the fab weather abroad but if you want pure luxury, service and complete chill time without paying through the nose, then you won't fail to be disappointed. Believe me, we are fussy and usually end up leaving early but this is bliss.",5,2012,08,10
217,Super sleep!,"Gifted a night at the Ritz, so was very excited. Check in was fine, room was lovely & comfortable as it was on a high floor as the lower room we saw was very dark. ipod docking station wasnt working & was immediately replaced by their ""engineer""! Facilities were great but atmosphere at the hotel was a little cold. No atmosphere in the bar for the mens 100m Olympic final either.. Room service was super, at a 5* price though. Lots of gadgets and fabulous bathroom & super comfy bed!! One of the best sleeps I have ever had!",4,2012,08,10
217,"WOW, WOW, WOW","I stumbled upon this hotel whilst looking for accommodation near Dublin.  Oh my God, this is simply stunning.  I travelled with my daughter and her husband and child, booked 2 Sugarloaf Mountain view rooms and we were not disappointed.  The hotel  rooms are well appointed and huge.  They have large entries, a small room off the entry to place your luggage (you could put a rollaway bed in it!!!!) The bathroom is sumptuous with a deep bath, separate shower area, separate toilet and large basin area and beautiful personal products that smell delicious.  We booked another night - we didn't want to leave.

We ate in the breakfast room each morning.  It was glorious looking out to the mountain with the sun streaming in.  The restaurant had a lovely array of food to choose from.

We used the golf buggies to visit the river walk and drive over the estate - very pleasant.  As we didn't have a car, we used the complimentary service of the hotel's range rover to drive us to and from the village - this was a welcomed service.

I guarantee you will not be disappointed.",5,2012,08,09
217,Absolutely fantastic,"This is quite simply a superb hotel. It was completed in 2007 at the peak of the property bubble / madness that the country experienced by one of Ireland's  leading and most flamboyant property developers.  It strikes me that this may have been  a vanity project and as a result the building / facilities are out of this world. I have not experienced anything like it in Ireland and it matches the best of top class hotels I have stayed in across the world.  The rooms are huge and beautifully finished. Loads of gadgets ( tv within mirror of bathroom, touch panel controls everything in the room).  We had a standard room but it had a small hall, walk in wardrobe, seperate seating area, huge bed and magnificent bathroom.  

The spa / pool / gym facilities were top class. The pool in particular was very well finished in black slate tiles and crystals which is very different and striking. Slightly disconcerting when swimming as it is very hard to make out the edge but overall the effect is very impressive.

We ate at the Gordon Ramsey restaurant which I had not heard much about previously. The meal was out of this world.  Every course we had was fantastic. I cannot  remember ever having such a lovely meal.  It was truly outstanding.   

The hotel is set in one of the most beautiful regions of the country. Unfortunately, the weather was dreadful while we were there but I saw enough of the park the hotel is set in and the local village while on a run in the rain to testify to the beauty of the place.

Finally,I mentioned the fact the hotel was completed just before our little bubble burst. The hotel is now run by NAMA ( Ireland's national agency set up to take non performing loans / assets off the balance sheet of our burst banks). It is clear that while the staff must have been through an uncertain time, they all seem to be committed to delivering a top class service. In fact, I think there is a modesty and down to earth approach in the way they work which is a little odd for a place of such spectacular grandeur but is much more in keeping with the Irish warmth and hospitality and all the better for it.  I will definitely back here and would absolutely recommend it to anyone looking for a very special experience.",5,2012,08,06
217,Simply Fantastic....,"I only had the pleasure of spending one day/one night at this resort.... Actually, it is an estate with private gardens, indoor pool, spa, nice gym, 2 18-hole golf courses, and incredible views.  Not far away is the tallest waterfall in Ireland (about 400 ft. high).  Prior to staying here, my brother, one of his friends and I stayed in Dublin for 2 days.  We decided to go see the countryside.... well, the Ritz at Powerscourt is it!  I used Marriott Reward points to book a last minute stay.  The Ritz in Powerscourt has to be the pride of the Ritz-Carlton/Marriott family.  The room was one of the best I have stayed in at a Marriott property.  The hotel was beautifully appointed.  I don't know what the typical ""rack rate"" would be, but I would recommend paying it.  You could easily spend 2-3 days on the estate (maybe more if you are a golfer).  The only regret that I have is not having another 2 days....

The Enniskerry village is very quaint, but small and options are limited.  A few restaurants and shops, but that is really all.  But, we didn't expect there to be much there anyway.  The resort has a free shuttle to the town, but I suggest walking as it is really not that far (but is all uphill on the way back and ALWAYS bring an umbrella in Ireland).  

We did not have a rental car, so had to take a cab.  It was about 40 Euro from Dublin then about 80 Euro to the airport.  The hotel does not have a shuttle service.  

I would not miss this property if you are on a trip to Ireland.  In fact, I plan on taking my family there next year.  In my opinion, it would be the perfect last couple of days of a trip before returning home.",5,2012,08,05
217,Disappointing,"Pluses:
Pleasant rooms. Lovely surroundings. Clean. Bathrooms great. Housekeeping adequate.
Minuses:
Understaffed with staff who appeared to be casual who really did not know the property. In every F & B outlet including conferencing there seemed to be a lack of management and co-ordination. I felt like I was staying at a Holiday Inn rather than a Ritz Carlton.",4,2012,08,04
217,Superb!,"We were very fortunate to be given a gift of 'The Gordon Ramsay Experience' in the Ritz Carlton Powerscourt, last weekend.  Our children had kindly booked this to celebrate our 40th wedding anniversary and we couldn't have been more thrilled.  Even though we know the area around Powerscourt well, we had never been in the actual hotel.  It is, without a doubt, one of the finest 5 star hotels we have been to anywhere in the world.  From the moment we arrived, we were treated with the utmost courtesy by ever member of staff, something which is sadly lacking in many establishments today. Nothing was too much trouble to anyone and they went out of their way to make sure that our stay was perfect.  Our room was large and spotlessly clean. Not only did it have a fascinating little tv in the mirror, but 'i pads' in the bedside drawer to control all the functions in the room, ie curtains, a/c, lights etc!  All a lot of fun!  We also had a nice card from the management wishing us a Happy Anniversary along with a delicious plate of handmade chocolates awaiting our arrival., a nice touch I think.  Our dinner in the Gordon Ramsay restaurant was absolutely superb.  It is a long time since we have enjoyed as good a meal, it could not have been faulted.  Service, yet again was excellent and we were even given a plate along with our coffee wishing us 'Happy Anniversary' with two lovely little cakes. A nice touch indeed.  The breakfast buffet was also excellent with plenty to choose from to suit all tastes.  Sadly the weather was awful so we were unable to enjoy the grounds, however, all in all we had a wonderful time and I would recommend the Ritz Carlton to anyone.",5,2012,08,03
217,Exceeded our expectations,"Everyone seems to say similar things.  Our suite was gorgeous and we had Fox News!!  The staff was helpful and very bright. My first meal , when we arrived was a Gluten Free soup and hot, fresh baked Gluten free rolls.This does not happen everywhere, and if you suffer from Celiac this was a treat.. 

Don't miss the Espa Spa, and the river walk.  Lunch at Avoca at the old Powerscourt Estate is another treat. 
Robbie the Concierge is a gem, and so are Fiacre, and Saskia to name a few.
We cannot wait to return.",5,2012,08,01
217,Great Place,"I don’t normally write a review but I feel the Ritz Carlton hotel in Powerscourt deserves one.  I have stayed in many top 5 star hotels around the world, from Monaco, Singapore, Indonesia, London etc and our experience in Powerscourt was among the best.  The staff, cleanliness, food, rooms, pool and spa were all excellent and well worth the (reasonably high) price we payed!",5,2012,08,01
217,Absolutely fabulous! Amazing staff and services.,"We stayed a week and could have stayed longer. Gorgeous room with breathtaking vistas. Beautiful amenities in our room. Great bedding, pillows, towels.  Fun to have the mirror tv in the bathroom.  Wonderful staff from all areas of the world..so happy, helpful and truly there to make the experience wonderful.  Great bikes available and the river walk/ride was amazing.  Cannot say enough about the morning sumptuous buffet and menu items...Gorgeous!  The pubwas also fun for casual drinks. Beautiful spa facilities.  Wonderful and we will do a repeat visit soon!",5,2012,07,31
217,Absolutely beautiful,"I'm late to writing this review, I went in August of 2010. This hotel is by far the nicest I've ever been to. The staff were all incredibly friendly and accommodating. The property, the lobby, the lounges, the rooms were all in perfect condition. We stayed in a Mountain View suite and had a breathtaking view of the grounds and Sugarloaf Mountain. The bed was extremely comfortable, the bathroom was huge, marble all over, and the toiletries were top notch (I've even saved some for special occasions when I want to sit back and remember our wonderful stay!) The spa area is unreal. The indoor pool and spa were gorgeous. The hammam was one of our favorite features in the whole hotel. The only thing about the hotel that I wasn't impressed with was the Gordon Ramsey restaurant. The food was mediocre at best and over priced. The waiter was also very clearly favoring the table next to us that were ordering all sorts of bottles of champagne. We took a ""tour"" of the kitchen, which was a little awkward and the kitchen itself really wasn't very impressive. But really, other than that, I can't say enough good things about this hotel. I would very highly recommend this place to anyone. Absolutely breathtaking.",5,2012,07,30
217,What a night!!,"I am writing to you with regard to our very recent stay at your hotel, so recent, in fact, that we only checked out today.  We were the Griffin party of nine, down to celebrate a 50th Birthday, and celebrate we did, but that is not why I am writing to you.

I am representing all nine guests, each of the same view and sentiment, to wholeheartedly bestow our sincerest gratitude to each and every member of staff at the Ritz Carlton, Enniskerry.

Our choice of hotel was important to us all and we chose well.  Before we even got in the door we were met by a smiling and welcoming face who took our luggage and car after gently guiding us to reception.  The staff at reception, again, were so pleasant and nothing was too much trouble for them even my 8 year old son was  put through his own personal check-in, which he loved. Our 4 rooms were fantastic and we were assisted through the various mod-cons by another smiling and extremely helpful porter.

The Gordon Ramsey experience, was definately an experience.  We were waited on, hand and foot, above and beyond, by Caoimhe.  She was everywhere, on top of it, serving food to us, laughing with us, entertaining the children, taking photographs for us, giving us recipes, I could go on and on.  Thank you so very very much Caoimhe, you made our night.  Needless to say, the food was equally outstanding, course after course of sumptious treats to the taste, followed by a tour of the kitchen, which we all enjoyed so much.

You will get no complaints from this party of nine.  Be it well enough to have a hotel, full of luxury and grandure but a hotel will not survuve on these traits alone.  The Ritz Carton, Enniskerry, should be used as an example to those other hotels, who do not follow in these footsteps, as Model in customer care.  The Room Staff, The Porters, The Reception, The Managers, all the staff, were simply and undoubtedly elite.  Thank you all, so much, for making our stay so memorable and fun, from begining to end.  We fervently look forward to visiting your great hotel again.  Well done to you all for doing a remarkable job.",5,2012,07,30
217,Great Hotel,"Excellent rooms- this was our second stay and we booked a suite with a balcony overlooking the mountains. The suite was huge and very luxurious. 
The SPA is excellent and we used the facilities every day of our stay- book in advance for any treatments. 
Hotel staff are excellent, particularly the reception and door staff. 
On arrival, there was a welcome card for us in the room with some handmade chocolates which was a lovely touch. 
The only thing I disliked about the hotel was the buffet breakfast, on each day of our 3 day stay we ate the breakfast ( incl in suite price) and on each occasion the cooked food was soggy and cold . This was disappointing and it did put us off trying the evening food - so we went out to Bray to eat each night. 
Other than this, the hotel really is amazing and it wouldnt put me off trying it again in the future.",5,2012,07,29
217,lovely stay,"loved our time here,  cant think of one bad thing to say.  Well done to management and staff, we stayed in the garden view suite and it was perfect, noise free and totally relaxing.  We would recommend this hotel to anyone who wants a romantic break away in the country while still being only ten kms from Dublin city. Staff were friendly without being in your face and the grounds around the hotel were beautifully maintained. We will definitely return.",5,2012,07,26
217,"Excellent hotel,lovely accomidation but food a let down","The hotel is absolutely amazing. The rooms are extremely clean, spacious and lovely views from them. The scenery is lovely and there are great wlks around the grounds. Breakfast is very nice and there is plenty of food to choose from from the buffet.The only let down for the hotel is the dinner in Gordon Ramsey's restaurant. The food was tasteless,cold and way to overpriced.Apart from that it is one of the best hotels I have ever stayed in.",5,2012,07,23
217,Very lovely experience!,"My family and I stayed here back in 2009 for a week and were sad when it was time to leave. The grounds of the hotel were gorgeous. One thing that we did while staying at the Ritz was rent bikes from the hotel and ride along the grounds around the golf course and up to the old family mansion which is no longer lived in. The pool and spa are very chic and luxurious. However, one con was that they have specified ""kid swim hours"" which upset my kids, however I can understand that some people would want to swim in the pool without a bunch of kids splashing about. The concierge was extremely helpful as well. One unique thing about the Ritz Carlton is that it has one of Chef Gordon Ramsey's restaurants, which was pricey but delicious. Very close to the hotel is a small town square named Enniskerry with a pub and a very good pizza place named Emilia's. There is also a little grocery store there, a laundromat, and an ice cream store. So I recommend going there if you have time. Also another bonus of staying at the Ritz is that they have free shuttles to and from Enniskerry, which is convenient. The golf courses looked very nice, however we are not a huge golf family so we never actually did the course. Overall, we really enjoyed our stay at the Ritz-Carlton and if we ever return to Ireland we'll be sure to book there again!",5,2012,07,22
217,Ireland should be proud to have such a great hotel,"This truly is a great hotel. Stayed here for a convention. The room was great though ours lacked a view! We were lucky enough to get one of the suites - half the rooms in the hotel seem to be suites. Room was world class and hard to fault. 
Lounge bar and restaurant were excellent and of typical American comfort - large leather seats with plenty of room. For comfort I don't think you would find a better hotel in Ireland. 
The downstairs Irish bar was completely fake but it worked and I was happy to spend time here even though it did not quite replicate a traditional Irish pub.
I will definitely be back.",5,2012,07,22
217,"Nice, ok","My hubby loved our stay here, I was slightly disappointed. When we arrived we were waiting around 10mins at the reception to be checked in and there wasnt much of a queue. We booked a suite and Gordon Ramsey experience. We were brought to our suite by concierge who was nice and pleasant. We were paying for a suite so expected a viiew, view was of carpark. The suite itself was lovely, one quibble, television in bedroom at one corner of room ,very hard to see from bed. We asked to use the complmentary bicycles as it was a beautful day, it took two visits to concierge, two phonecalls and two hours later. The pool and spa was fabulous and very relaxing. Our dinner in the restaurant was good, startes delicious, we both had rib eye steak for main, it was tough and fatty, not really expected at a Gordon Ramsey restaurant. Dessert was delicious, waiter was very gracious and helpful. Breakfast was amazing, really enjoyed same. Overall enjoyed stay but had a few disappointments. Still would recommend a stay, however book a mountain view suite!",4,2012,07,21
217,Pure luxury,"I have stayed at the Ritz Carlton twice, once for a corporate weekend and following that a one night stay.  Each was excellent.

The hotel is beautiful, immaculate and gorgeous.  Staff are so friendly and attentive. Although a five star hotel I never felt out of place, just very relaxed and comfortable.

Both times I stayed in a garden suite. It was beaufiful, furnishings of a high standard and again immaculate.

The pool area, I did feel, is a little bit dark but very comfortable and relaxing.  I certainly chilled out!

I had breakfast which was fine, at my corporate weekend attended a gala dinner which was excellent and on the next tripmate in the bar. Food was good and well priced I felt.

The grounds are lovely, really worth a walk round.

Powerscoirt grounds and shop nearby are worth a visit as are waterfalls also close hu.

All in all a great place, time to return, I think!",5,2012,07,20
217,Fantastic,"Wow! What a great experience. We only wish we had more time to enjoy the entire hotel and the area. Exceptional service from the moment we arrived. Recognition of our anniversary in many ways from flowers to a dessert tastefully decorated just for us. Loved our room with  beautiful views. Spa was enjoyable with great pool. We so enjoyed our first night in the Gordon Ramsay rest. That we returned on the second night for an equally great meal. Andre was a talented and attentive server. All other staff wonderful as well. We hope to be back! I've mostly stayed at Marriott brands in recent years, but I realize now why a miss ritz branded hotels so much.",5,2012,07,19
217,Perfect place to explore the surrounding area,"The hotel itself is easy to find when driving yourself, and the entrance to Powerscourt and into the hotel couldn't be more beautiful.  I was able to get a wonderful rate with an upgraded room and felt well looked after during my entire stay.  The 3D concierge was extremely helpful with activity suggestions and directions.  He arranged a bicycle for riding on the estate and on the river walk and directions for local points of interest and even suggested a hiking trail perfectly suited to my needs.  He also assisted with business needs during my stay.
Breakfast, lunch and dinner in all three restaurants/pub were just perfect (if you don't already know, one of the restaurants is owned by Gordan Ramsey).  The international staff was attentive and interested.  When life permits me, I will stay here again.",5,2012,07,19
217,Has the Wow Factor,"If you want 5* luxury then look no further than this very, very special place.  It is fully deserving of all the praise lavished on it by previous reviewers. It is built on the grounds of idyllic Powerscourt Estate with wonderful mountain views and walks.  From check in to check out everything was excellent beyond belief. There were six in our party and not one of us could find a single fault. What makes this hotel wonderful is the attention to detail by all the pleasant and competent staff. Nothing was too much trouble.  Suites are luxurious and tastefully furnished. We loved the TV inset in the mirror. Quality and selection of food at breakfast and dinner in the Gordon Ramsey restaurant were excellent. We have stayed in a lot of lovely hotels but this was definitely the best ever. For a special occasion you won't get better. We can't wait to go back. Thank you to all the staff.",5,2012,07,11
217,Heaven in Wicklow,"The unfortunate thing about our stay was that it was only one night.  But that one night was absolutely fab!  We checked in and were escorted to our upgraded mountain view suite - wow!  It was huge, I'd love to live there.  We had a wander around the hotel, it's impressive with no expense spared.  We stopped off at McGill's bar, it is expensive but a lovely chilled place to have a drink - we had two, but could have stayed and had more.  We attended a ball in the hotel the night we stayed, it was great.  The meal served to 300 attendees was really good, don't know how they got 300 fillet steaks so perfect?! Back to our room that night and the bed was so comfortable, I had a great night's sleep.  We got breakfast delivered to the room, 2 full Irish arrived on time, perfectly hot - a real treat sitting off in our own suite having a lovely breakfast.  

I will definitely go back - even though I live 15km away.  I want to get back into room 621 and take full advantage of the spa, and go for a meal in the restaurant and do more people watching in the impressive hotel foyer.  Lovely place place, that is expensive but does send you away with a good feeling.",5,2012,07,10
217,Perfect Start of our Irish Vacation,"We spent the first two nights of an Idyllic Ireland vacation at the Ritz.The grounds of the Powerscourt Gardens add to the beauty of the Wicklow location. Service was excellent, especially at check in and concierge (Trish).Room was upgraded to beautiful suite, breakfast is so fresh and plentiful. Only negative is the pool area, which is understandably indoor, but very dark. Tried to give it a spa-feel, but very uninviting.",4,2012,07,09
217,"Stayed 1 night, glad I wasn't paying",Stayed 1 night in December 2011 and I'd forgotten to leave a review.  The front of the hotel is consumed by a multi story car park and is not at all inviting.  I know that the rear of the hotel has wonderful views across the Wicklow Mountains but alas our room looked out over the car park!  The room itself was very large and was furnished to a very high standard as you'd expect.  The public areas are also impressive.  We didn't eat at the hotel as the group we were with wanted to go to Johnnie Fox's Pub (not an evening I'll repeat any time soon).  On our return we went down to the hotel's Irish theme bar for a night cap and I found this to have absolutely no atmosphere at all and all the seating options were uncomfortable.  We opted for room service breakfast and to say it was disappointing would be an understatement.  The sausages were of a very poor quality and the rest of the food was rather cold and underwhelming.  The overall experience left me more than a little disappointed as I was looking forward to staying here but now I've been I won't be rushing back.,3,2012,07,08
217,Wonderful place to stay,This is an absolutely beautiful property with it being next door to the Powerscourt Gardens. The rooms are large with good temperature control. Everyone in Ireland is very nice and the staff here are no exception. Enniskerry is close by and an easy walk to town. The wireless Internet connection is strong throughout the hotel and it has a nice 5 mb download speed. That is something you don't find in many hotels. All in all I would definitely comeback here.,5,2012,07,07
217,Absolute perfection,"Given the high cost of a stay at this hotel I was really hoping not to be disappointed. As it turns out the hotel surpassed all my expectations and we had the most wonderful stay.
We brought our two little girls and they were extremely well looked after and catered for. They were absolutely besotted with the place and are already scheming to be brought back there!
This was not really a surprise as we occasionally venture up to the hotel for a coffee and even when not staying in the hotel the staff are effortlessly courteous and warm.
The most welcome surprise for me was the Gordon Ramsey Restaurant. 
I hadn't expected it to fully live up to the hype and to perhaps be all style and no substance but, wow, I had the most incredibly delicious meal there and will definitely be returning for the restaurant alone!
I didn't get the name of our waiter but he was really superb. Enthusiastic, professional, accommodating and just really added to the whole experience for us. I loved the dining room and the view, of course, is just lovely.",5,2012,07,06
217,Beautiful hotel... not the Gordon Ramsay,"Had a great time in the hotel, great service, location and beautiful rooms!
The Gordon Ramsay was disappointing, you better end up going to the pub in the hotel.
Try the high tea and reserve the seat at the window.",4,2012,07,05
217,A Must Stay,The staff at this hotel are 5 star in my book.  My wife and I stayed 7 nights last week and we could not have asked for better service from the staff. Trisha at the concierge desk was the best.  This hotel is a must stay.,5,2012,07,04
217,Disappointed,My partner and I stayed here and overall had a good time. There were a few small issues so my partner drafted and posted a letter addressed to the manager. We have never felt a reason to do this before-in fact we usually send thank you notes to hotels! We still have not had any response. This is disrespectful and disappointing and would make us slow to stay there again if our concerns are not valued.,4,2012,07,02
217,Great night away,"Stayed here with friends and what anight .Very posh and up market ,had food in the bar no faults could be found.not a place i would take the kids not because its not for kids but this is a place you go to get away from the kids.Best nights sleep in the big beds .five stars all around
.",5,2012,07,01
217,Does not disappoint,"We stayed here for 4 nights as part of a business reward trip.  When we return to this area, we will certainly return.  By far the most impressive part of the trip was the service and attitude provided by the entire staff.  From the greeting to the departure we never saw anything but smiles from everyone.

Our room was a suite on the the second floor.  Although it did not offer the views that our friends on the 6th floor enjoyed, our room was perfect for us in that it provided a completely separate living room area from the bedroom.  As I tend to wake up in the middle of the night the first few days, this provided a refuge for me while my wife was able to sleep.

We played golf on the West course and found it to be all of the challenge we needed.  Unfortunately, the greens had recently been ""punched"" and therefore were a bit bumpy.  Still, just a minor inconvenience.

Our breakfast in the Gordon Ramsey restaurant was included in our rate, and it was certainly more than adequate.  I cannot speak to the value.

The only minor disappointment was the dinner we had our last night in the Gordon Ramsey restaurant.  While certainly OK, it was not up to the standards that we have come to expect from 5 star restaurants.  That having been said, the service was outstanding and the wine list was excellent with many well priced selections from around the world.

All things considered, a terrific property that certainly upholds the Ritz Carlton standards.",5,2012,07,01
217,Great location and fab spa,"Set in the heart of a wonderful Irish estate, this hotel has fantastic facilities next door to the fabulous gardens of Powerscourt. Very comfortable rooms with dressing room and large bathroom. Liked the tv in the bathroom mirror. Irish music in the hotel bar was truly excellent. We enjoyed using the pool and spa facilities? Not too far to drive into the city if you want some action. However we also enjoyed the boutiques in the village.",5,2012,06,30
217,Wonderful stay,"Beautiful hotel and wonderful location.  Cannot complain.  The hotel accommodation was fantastic.  I love the control panel for the lights and the layout of the room. Also like the television on the bathroom mirrors.  Breakfast was well thought out and delicious.  So too was dinner.  County Wicklow is a very scenic area. Lots of interesting areas nearby to visit.  Powerscourt gardens and waterfall are nearby and a must visit.
The staff as the hotel was very well trained and sought to cater for any need that arose.  My stay was for St. Patrick's Day weekend and the hotel was fully booked but this did not prevent them from providing excellent service.",5,2012,06,29
217,Superb,"Upgraded to a small suite and stayed for three nights.  I purchase a package that included golf and breakfast.  I thought this was a very good value.  The room was very nice - huge wardroom/closet area, very nice living room with coach, chair and desk and chair.  Bathroom was very nice with white marble and separate tub and shower.  Breakfast in the restaurant was great. Nice selection and service was very good. We were often hurrying to make a tee time they provided very good service. The golf was great, played both the East and West courses. One piece of advice - bring lots of balls, as a ball hit into the ruff will be a lost ball.  The hotel is on a spectacular estate which is nice to walk around.  It is close to the town of Enniskerry.  They provide free car service into town, which is nice.",5,2012,06,28
217,Loved everything about our stay,"The staff was great, the room large, clean and comfortable, and the hotel restaurants and health spa fantastic.  This is high end but if you can afford the cost the experience makes it this a worthwhile use of funds.  I was there with my wife and daughter and it was delightful.",5,2012,06,28
217,"Great hotel, rooms and service!","Biggest downside to Powerscourt Ritz Carlton is that it does not have a specific address and is not on GPS.   :)     Simple fix, just put in Enniskerry on GPS and you are set--it is just up the road!

Great hotel!!   Service was excellant.   Robbie at concierge desk was incredible.  Rooms--awesome!   Very big suite with separate walk-in closet.   Luscious beds--so relaxing after a long trip.  Very high tech with computer screens in each room for lights, shutting curtains, etc.  Flat panel screen TVs.   Excellant food.  Great pub.  Beautiful place to stay!

Nearby Gardens and Shopping was great!  Good prices in the shops at the Garden and was able to buy many of my gifts to bring home there.  Spent 2 hours just shopping there, followed by wonderful tour of the Gardens.

Stayed at a lot of Ritz-Carltons and this one definitely did not disappoint--would love to visit again!",5,2012,06,26
217,Excellent!,"I stayed at The Ritz-Carlton Powerscourt six months ago and, despite of that fact, I continue remembering my great stay there and I didn't want to miss the chance to write a review and compliment the hotel for it.

The property is really impressive. Two years ago I stayed at a very similar property (Ritz-Carlton VillaLonga, in Portugal) and this one was even better. The location is perfect (close to Dublin but, at the same time, in the middle of the countryside), the gardens and landscape are really beautiful, service is friendly, very efficient and attentive but not intrusive, the public places are grand but, at the same time, very cozy and with a relaxed atmosphere, and the rooms are huge, immaculate and wonderfully apointed.

I reserved the trip as a gift for my parents and booked a Mountain View Suite for them and a Superior Room for me. The suite was obviously great, with a classic decor with wood furnitures and bright blue shades but also with state of the art technology, like the TV on the bathroom mirror and the touchpad control for lighting, curtains, etc. However, the Superior Room was as nice as the suite too, in very elegant brown/green shades, bigger than many junior suites in other hotels, with a foyer, a dressing room and the same excellent bathroom of the suite. Both of them immaculately clean.

Finally, the atmoshere was great (one of the best things about the place): nothing too formal but very relaxed instead, you felt like home. Breakfast buffet very good, too, as expected from this type of hotel. Free parking close to the main entrance.

I would definitely go back and would recommend this place to anyone visiting Dublin and its surroundings.",5,2012,06,26
217,A Refuge for the travel weary,"Simply an outstanding place to stay when one crosses the Atlantic and arrives in Dublin. About 40 minutes from the airport (stay on the motorway and avoid the Dublin traffic), the rooms were comfortable, the service was exceptional, and the food delicious.  Close to some of the best scenery in Eastern Ireland, you can visit the Powerscourt Gardens next door, or drive the winding roads to Avoca Mills. An ideal and quiet spot when recovering from jet lag.

We stayed 2 nights at the start of our Ireland vacation and was perfect.",5,2012,06,24
217,Fabulous,Fabulous 5star experience. This hotel is ideal for a quiet getaway. Right beside powers court gardens and the waterfall is no to far away.,5,2012,06,22
217,Luxurious Stay!,"We arrived at 6 PM and greeted by the friendly and helpful staff.  We were wowed by our room(s)--gorgeous and elegant!  The view from our rooms was the Sugar Loaf Mountain which is breath-taking. Our roll-aways were already in the rooms when we arrived and soon someone was knocking for turn down service and ice.  We had a delicious dinner in the restaurant.  We played chess with the larger than life chess set and walked the grounds.  My daughter's birthday was the next morning and I inquired about purchasing flowers (we were too late for a spa appointment).  Soon after my request, someone was at my door with two bunches of sunflowers (I think they took two from their own displays) which was perfect to present to my daughter when she awoke.  At breakfast they surprised us with a plate of berries and chocolate, complete with a candle and handwritten ""Happy Birthday""!  We decided to checkout later than planned because we were enjoying the relaxing atmosphere.  We took a bike ride, with the complimentary bikes, down along the river.  This ride passed the Powerscourt House, golf course and winded down a hill through woodlands.  Along the river we encountered horses in a pasture and beautiful landscape. We would definitely come back!!",5,2012,06,21
217,Worth the money,"I won't write too much because this hotel has been extensively reviewed and almost universally applauded. We stayed there for a friend's wedding and had a brilliant time. 
First the customer service: every single staff member, from those at the front desk to those in the pub, were attentive and helpful. They dropped us in town at night, provided bottles of water when the boys returned from their runs and gave us maps and extensive advice about what to see on our way back to Dublin. 
The rooms were beautifully decorated and decked out with the latest technology. Those at the front have wonderful views to Sugar Loaf Mountain. Some do look out over the car park though. The spa was stunning and wonderfully relaxing. 
The breakfast buffet was the best I've ever had. The only small criticism I have is that the service was a bit slow when we were sitting outside ... it was brilliant the day before. We also ate in the Sugar Loaf lounge and were very happy with the food. 
I expected the Ritz to be fantastic and it was. Most of the other places we stayed at while in Ireland were about half the price ... but they weren't nearly half as good! Treat yourself to a couple of days here when exploring beautiful County Wicklow.",5,2012,06,19
217,Nice but not quite a Ritz-Carlton experience,"We booked our first 2 nights of a 10-night Ireland holiday at the Powerscourt Ritz using some awards points. We are regular, long-term Marriott & Ritz-Carlton customers who have come to expect a certain quality from the Ritz-Carlton chain. Booking was simple with excellent availability for our dates. Upon arrival we were given the customary 'next level' room upgrade typical for Gold and Platinum rewards members.  

The reception, bellmen, and valet services staff were all friendly, efficient, and as expected. 

We enjoyed the hotel's beautiful public areas. The Pub was cozy and the staff, particularly Charlotte, were very welcoming. The Spa was excellent with professional staff offering a wide-variety of services. I had a manicure with Haley and that was truly one of the nicest parts of our stay. The hotel grounds themselves are gorgeous with scenic views of Sugarloaf mountain and beautiful gardens. The hotel is walking distance from the Powerscourt Estate & Gardens which are themselves well worth the trip to Enniskerry. 

The room itself was comfortably furnished with a king-sized bed, small sofa, two chairs, coffee table, and a writing desk. Pretty typical Ritz-Carlton decor. However, upon more than a cursory inspection it was not particularly well-maintained or clean. The carpet was stained with several large, red wine stains that were obviously permanent. 

We were upgraded from a classic superior room to a larger, classic king with a shared balcony at the front of the hotel. The balcony was shared with several other rooms, separated by concrete planters and shall we say, had no privacy and a less than welcoming view primarily of the car park and the back of the pub. There were discarded cigarette butts in the planters, and a white residue on the patio furniture which I discovered only after it was transferred to my slacks!  

The bed was comfortable with Frette linens and down pillows & comforters, but again the details were that it was not particularly well made-up and had to be remade before retiring. No extra pillows or blankets were provided anywhere in the room. The dressing area consisted of a large closet area off the front doorway, it had ample storage but the lighting was dim and without seating it certainly wasn't suitable for dressing. 

The bathroom was lovely with a large soaking tub, a double sink with make-up mirror, a small flat-screen television, a private toilet room, and shower area. Sadly, we noticed there was a constant hissing noise emanating from the shower. We adjusted the handles, spigot and nozzles to no avail. This diminished the enjoyment of a nice soak as the noise became grating after a minute or two.  We finally closed the bathroom door when sleeping to avoid the ""hissing"" from the shower. The second problem, one apparently common throughout Ireland was, there were no electrical outlets in the bathroom.  I ended-up doing my hair in the entryway so I could plug-in the converter and curling iron and then stretch the cords across the room to a mirror.  Again, not what I expect from a Ritz folks. Really? 

This hotel just fails to meet five-star and on occasion even four-star expectations.  Perhaps it's not traditional in Ireland, but no ice bucket was available in our room, no ice was offered upon arrival, and when we called for ice we were transferred to room service and waited a good 30 minutes for a bucket of ice and a single bottle of water tp be delivered. I know this may seem a minor detail--perhaps picky to a fault--but really isn't exceptional service what people usually expect from a 5-star resort at these prices?  

While it is unlikely we will visit this particular Ritz-Carlton again, I hope someone in management there reads this review. Another minor detail is that we were not asked for feedback after our stay--usually we receive an e-mail inquiring about the stay soon after we depart! 

Overall this is a nice hotel that based on our experience is worthy of a 3.5 or 4-star rating. It isn't terrible, but is isn't a typical, high-quality Ritz-Carlton experience either.  Go expecting a 3- or 4-star Marriott with scenic surroundings and you won't be disappointed--apparently we expected too much.",3,2012,06,17
217,awesome hotel!!,"Whenwe made our reservation, they said all they had was a small room with a kingside bed! as there are just two of us, not a problem. well if 700 square feet is small, I can't imagine what is large! We actually have two rooms: one large bedroom and a sitting room/dining room combination. 
the staff is incredibly helpful. An Irish pub on the top floor to watch Ireland's soccer matches.",5,2012,06,17
217,Impressive Hotel,"Opened in 2007 this is defo not the typical ""boom"" hotel that was built.  The hotel is situated in a lovely grounds and powerscourt gardens.  
Sometimes when one looks at the pictures of a hotel the reality is very different.  This is not the case with the ritz as the hotel is exactly like the photos on the website. 
Check in was efficient and quick and there was enough staff on duty to make sure that you werent waiting. 
I was booked into a classic suite and all I can say is WOW.  Guest bathroom in the entrance room, separate kitchen with cooker and the living/dining room was massive and comfortable. 
The bedroom was huge leading to a walk in wardrobe and a huge bathroom with separate toilet and shower. 
Lights and curtains were operated at the touch of a button.  Only fault is that the aircon only goes down to 19 deg and wished it would go a bit lower. 
No faults with the food.  We lunched in the resturaunt at the reception area and was lovely.  Dinner in Gordon Ramsey was very nice.  
Breakfast the next morning was one of the best buffet breakfast i have ever had.",5,2012,06,17
217,Impressive hotel!,"We spent 6 days/nights at the hotel and it is the best hotel we have had the opportunity to visit! The grounds and surrounding Powerscourt Gardens and waterfall areas were amazing to see and the friendly and helpful staff members were phenomenal. We enjoyed every moment of our stay here and we would recommend this hotel to those who would like a relaxing stay in a serene environment where they can just relax and enjoy themselves. The restaurants and pub were also pleasant surprises as the food was excellent and the service was tremendous. The rooms are beautiful, the bathroom was phenomenal (in the suites). We loved the ""rainshower"" showers and the digital TV in the mirror was too cool for words. Zsolts and Kinga (staff members) are exemplary employees of the Ritz- Carlton. They made our stay even more pleasant.",5,2012,06,16
217,Wonderful!,"The hotel looks like an old castle from the outside, majestic.  Indoors very high quality.  Lovely spacious rooms.  Gorgeous grounds. Very helpful staff.  Would definitely return.",5,2012,06,14
217,Exceeded our expectations!,"All I can say is WOW!  We anticipated from the reviews that our stay was going to be special but never did we think how special it actually was to stay in this magnificent establishment.  Everything was great.  The staff was warm and friendly.  The concierge was fabulous and went out of her way to map out different areas we were visiting.  The free parking was a bonus and each time we went out, we look forward to coming back to our gorgeous suite.  We had a balcony and were in a corner unit which looked at the gardens and part of the mountain.  Stunning room with all the luxuries of home and then some!  We have been back in Miami for a couple of months and we still reminisce on our visit to the Ritz-Powerscourt Estates.",5,2012,06,14
217,Another Wonderful Stay !,"This is our seventh time to stay at the Ritz Carlton Powerscourt and each time is as good as the last. I choose it each time for family celebrations as we know now that the Ritz know how to make your stay special.
The rooms are spacious and bathrooms are warm with plenty of Towels
Have used all dining options Gordon Ramsays,Sugar Loaf Lounge and Mc Gills Bar {service in Gordon Ramsay can be a bit hit and miss}
 The staff are friendly and helpful great with children.
If you look for flaws anywhere you will find them .....but over all the Ritz Carlton is a wonderful place to relax and unwind and we can't wait till the next visit.",5,2012,06,13
217,Out of this world!,"Stayed here for 2 nights when our daughter was getting married in Enniskerry, and it was excellent from start to finish.  Our room was spacious, plus a big bathroom off the entrance lobby and a huge dressing room opposite.  We had great fun playing with all the touchscreen controls, especially the ones for opening and closing the curtains!  We overlooked a beautiful little courtyard garden, and it was nice to be able to open the windows for some good Wicklow country air.

The two breakfasts we had were both very good, a wide variety of food both hot and cold.  Special mention to Andras (hope that's the correct spelling) who couldn't do enough for us, plus the manager who went and found Marmite for me - always a good sign as far as I'm concerned!  We also had a family dinner in a room off the Sugar Loaf lounge the night before the wedding, and it was very good too.

The hotel staff did everything possible to assist us on the wedding day - well done all round, including moving my daughter's possessions to the suite for when she and her new husband returned.  You really helped to make it a very special occasion.

I'd love to come back again and relax into the sheer luxury of the place at a later date - I'll start saving now!",5,2012,06,11
217,Wonderful..apart from the Gordon Ramsay restaurant!,"My husband & I stayed at the Ritz-Carlton for two nights, 5th & 6th of May. The trip was a gift from our wonderful kids for their dad's birthday. First impressions: really friendly doorman, lovely, helpful reception staff. Our room was incredible, large enough to host a dinner party! Welcoming gift of chocolates, & two king-sized beds. Despite the dull & showery weather we had a lovely view of Sugarloaf mountain from our bedroom window. 
Breakfast was good, reasonable selection of cooked food & a lot of sweet concoctions suitable for other palates!
The only disappointment for us was the Gordon Ramsey restaurant. We had been looking forward to a unique dining experience. Sadly, the food was just ok, nothing special, certainly not as good as we had anticipated.
I had seared scallops to start, husband had smoked chicken & foie gras terrine, both very ordinary. The scallops were tasteless & the terrine was rubbery..hubby said not a patch on my homemade pate!
For mains we fared a bit better, well cooked monkfish for me & tender sirloin for himself. I finished with an selection of excellent Irish cheese and hubby had a delicious raspberry millefeuille. Service was good but the overall impression was not a ""Gordon Ramsay"" experience. Maybe our expectations were too high....food in the 5* Slieve Donard in Newcastle Co Down was far superior, scallops to die for!
Don't miss: a visit to Powerscourt House; a tour of the Wicklow Mountains & a visit to Glendalough. Lots more to see in the area, just get in the car & head for the hills!",4,2012,06,09
217,the spa is the best part,"The hotel is in an absolutely stunning setting but be warned - it is FAR from Dublin proper.  The hotel is lovely but once you get in the guest rooms they are pretty standard.  Service was silly - what I can't understand is given the state of the Irish economy and the legendary Irish service, why are there so few Irish working here? It was difficult to have a conversation with many of the staff because they were all from the far reaches of eastern Europe. (particularly bad service in the ""gordon ramsay"" restaurant.  Ex. Rooms weren't cleaned until really, really late in the afternoon.  The response I got was that ""we have until 6 to clean"" and then I was sent a random plate of some desserts.  How about a clean room?

The spa was worth the trip though - impeccable and lovely staff, great services.  I would definitely recommend if you're making a spa visit.",3,2012,06,07
217,great hotel.,"have stayed here 3 times before and each time i cant fault it . rooms are amazing , the hotel itself and the grounds are amazing. if you want 5 star , if you want class here it is. 
i live 30 mins from this hotel and when you get there it feels like a million miles away.
book it and stay here 100 % best hotel in Ireland that iv stayed in",5,2012,06,06
217,Totally fit for Royalty.....,"I had occasion to lunch at the Ritz Carlton and took a room for overnight stay , my impression is simply superb all over. Beautiful lunch, lovely scenic view looking out on the the mountains and the service was friendly and elequant . Selection was good but the highlight was an upgrade to a huge Suite for my overnight stay. It was superb with everything where it should be. Three televisions to choose from, walk in changing rooms , bathrooms and shower rooms separate, heated flooring and the bed was excellent. Reception staff were efficient and very pleasant. My overall impressions were a 5 star plus for this place. A great place for that special treat and the surroundings are totally magnificent .",5,2012,06,04
217,Wonderful place.,"We booked this as part of a Sceptre vacation package which included 2 nights here and 2 nights  each at 2 castle hotels, airfare, and a rental car for the week.  The price was only a bit more than just the airfare.  We were delighted by the hotel.  It is much higher end than we usually book but with Irish economy being so dismal, they seem to try to fill beds in whatever way possible.  The staff is lovely. 

We booked the chefs table at Gordon Ramsey and loved being in the kitchen watching the goings-on while dining.  Very entertaining.

Hope to go back to explore the area more fully.",5,2012,06,04
217,What a great hotel,The staff was excellent.  We had a issue with our heat and they responded immediately by switching us to another room.  Food was excellent as well.  We plan to return to this hotel to explore the grounds much more.,5,2012,06,03
217,Pure luxury. Yet very cozy and intimate.,"What a fantastic place! They say, Ireland is the country of 40 green colors. Well, I have seen them all not leaving the hotel territory! The hotel is very big, but being only a few floors, it's spread out accross the beautiful park and woods and surrounded by the green vegetation, including internal gardens. Even though I stayed for business (and it has excellent facilities for business meetings and conferences) still, the first thought of mine was, what a perfect place for weddings, anniversaries, romantic gataways, golfers, those who want to escape the city rhythm and noise and embrace the nature! I should come back here for a family vacation or a romantic occasion!
The room are beyond praise, so is the service. And of course very high food standards, including the Gordon Ramsey's restaurant. ",5,2012,06,03
217,The ultimate experience,"Stayed at Powerscourt for a conference in May 2012. Property was beautiful and staff was extremely helpful. Rooms were the ultimate in Luxury and our view was breathtaking. Loved the electronics in our room, being able to turn the do not disturb on from bedside was so convenient. Food was great the whole visit. My only complaint was dinner at the Ramsey restaurant. Service was sub par and very disappointing. Overall it was an awesome trip, beautiful location and would recommend it to anyone.",5,2012,06,03
217,It's all 5 stars about this hotel!,"Pros: - huge rooms, I think they are even bigger than my flat back home
- you have all you can think of in your room
- professional staff
- very nice location, it's a pleasure to just walk around and breathe clean air
Cons: - nothing worth mentioning",5,2012,06,02
217,Great end to a great trip!,"Wow!!  We visited Ireland a few weeks ago for a week and stayed here our last night.  Upon arrival we were greeted by very friendly staff who assisted us in getting situated in our suite.  The suite's lights and curtains are controlled by a touch screen near the door and on either side of the bed...very luxurious!  The bed was sooo very comfortable!!  We immediately made a reservation for later at the Gordon Ramsey and then went to the concierge and got a map of the Estate.  We walked to Powerscourt Estate and Gardens and walked around there for a bit.  Amazing!!!  When we went back to the hotel we went down to the spa and swam in pool.  The water was warm and the hot tub was wonderful!  The restaurant was great, maybe a bit pricey, but overall wonderful.  We would have LOVED to have stayed longer, but our time in Ireland was over.  We did also eat breakfast in the Gordon Ramsey and it was also delicious, as we expected!!",5,2012,06,01
217,Superb Stay,"I was slightly perturbed by some of the reviews on here but as ever if you cut through the personal nonsense you get to the truth. This is an excellent Hotel with superb levels of service. Gordon Ramsey is slightly expensive for what ultimately is a chain hotel but nonetheless was an excellent meal. I would recommend a vist to Powerscourt Gardens next door - superb gardens ans an excellent cafe/bistro - in fact an excellent idea for lunch being a short walk from the hotel. The pool is adult friendly and quiet, you can get a nice pint in McGills and overall - well an excellent base for Wicklow.",5,2012,05,31
217,Amazing !,"We stayed  for my birthday which happened that on the last night was Valentine's night, the meal was one of the best I ever had, The spa & swimming pool are amazing, The bedroom & bed were were ever so  comfortable, &  a great spacious bathroom with t.v & powerful shower. food at Gordon Ramseys  was  delicious, There is so much to see & do here, We made use of the complimentary bikes, also the golf buggies which we took around the powerscourt estate, 
If you are looking for a relaxing time or getting out about to see the beautiful views off Wicklow .
I suggest you stay here, I'm now  about to book again as we got a voucher from our friends for my partners 50th!      Happy days,",5,2012,05,31
217,Best service ever,"I had planned to stay only one night for a friend's wedding, although I managed to break my leg in the course of the reception. As you do. My wife came over to wait for me to be discharged from hospital and the staff couldn't have been more helpful. Time and again they went over and beyond the call of duty, extremely efficient, but never in a corporate hotel chain fashion. At a very stressful time, they made things a whole lot easier. And if that wasn't enough, their breakfast is excellent, the rooms are huge, the location is wonderful and the prices aren't bad at all.

I couldn't recommend highly enough and will be back as soon as I can stand unaided!",5,2012,05,22
217,Execellent,"We stayed here beginning of May because we were getting married in Powerscourt House. 

The hotel is first class. The staff were excellent in every way. No request seemed insurmountable. For example, my watch strap broke and the concierge  was able to get it repaired and fixed in 30 mins. The rooms are excellent. We had a suite with a balcony, I think it was the honeymoon suite which was excellent as were the spa facilities.

If you're thinking of a good location to stay this is a good spot. Trips to Wicklow and Glendalough are easy as are trips to Dublin and Bray, where we visited the excellent Harbour Bar. If your budget accommodates, I highly recommend a night or two here.",5,2012,05,21
217,To many issues,"Lovely hotel with great potential let down by poor maintenance and some not so helpful staff.
Issues I had included
•	The heating in the suite did not work correctly.  Having it on actually cooled the room.
•	The hot water ran dirty on two nights while we where there (stayed for three nights)
•	The milk for the tea was out of date by two months!
•	The pool area was cold (pool itself was a nice temperature though)
•	The breakfast was good, but not great
•	One of the waiters at the Sugar Loaf Lounge was not at all helpful

It was not the experience that I was expecting for the money that I paid.",2,2012,05,20
217,Phenomenal!,"We had the pleasure of staying at this absolutely stunning property. We had a gorgeous suite complete with a kitchen, dining room, and living room.  We also had a patio overlooking the grounds. I have never been so breath-taken, but the beauty of this place and the Irish countryside was one of the most beautiful I've ever seen.  We borrowed bikes from the concierge and rode through the Powerscourt grounds and ended up in the nearby town of Enniskerry where we ate and ended up at Mac's Bar and being hosted by Alex O'Niel and Mash.  Go see them…they are a delight!  The staff at the hotel came and picked us up in their Landrover and transported our bikes back to the hotel for us.  What SERVICE!!  I can't say enough great things about this hotel",5,2012,05,18
217,Wow. Amazing - and surprisingly good value.,"Okay - so it's the Ritz.  You expect it to be good - and it is.  You expect it to be expensive... and to be fair it is a bit, but not as much as I thought it would be, and certainly not as much as I would probably have paid.  The rooms, food and beverage are all a bit more than you would typically find in a hotel... but the level of quality is far higher than the increase in price.  Definitely worth it.  In fact... has got me thinking that I might travel less but spend more... nah, not going to happen.  But I will definitely consider this level of accomodation in future as I think that the additional expense is worth it.

Rooms were fantastic (only small gripe is the touchpad controls for the lights/drapes/etc - as this was great for novelty value but a bit of a pain to operate at times), service was the best I've experienced outside 5+ star in Asia - we ate in the Ramsey and the Sugar Loaf.  The pool is amazing and you really should take time to enjoy it - pack your bathers!  Although if you don't (like me) they sell reasonably priced (€30) shorts if you need them.

The river walk and free cycle hire are also an added bonus.  We didn't take advantage of the golf course (other than a quick jaunt on the bikes) but it looked awesome if you are a player.  Would probably want to be pretty good as it didn't look like the kind of course that takes kindly to digging up the fairways and lots of yelling 'fore'.

The sort of place that you could go to as a destination on it's own and ignore the surrounding attractions as there is plenty to keep you occupied in the lap of luxury for a long weekend.

Thoroughly enjoyed our long weekend there.  And a fantastic venue to hold a wedding!  We attended fantastic wedding with ceremony at church down the road and reception at the Powerhouse.

Go on... treat yourself.",5,2012,05,16
217,Beautiful property at an amazing value,"perhaps a little too far from all of the Dublin sites, but a peaceful property near waterfalls and outdoor beauty.",5,2012,05,13
217,Just perfect,"We stayed at the Ritz for one evening during the May bank holiday.  We couldn't have asked for a better experience.  Our suite was generously sized and overlooked a lovely forest.  It was beautifully decorated, and every detail was well thought out.  

We had our child with us and particularly appreciated the special touches such as the cot provided, relatively soundproof walls, and little bathrobe just for him!  We ate in the pub onsite and also ordered dessert in the lobby (wonderful!) and felt that he was very welcome everywhere.

I should say that the hotel pub is just fabulous.  If you have a vision in your head of what a little dream pub would look like, this is it.  Open fire, cozy tables, great soup and a pint while watching ruggers...perfect!

We had grand plans of exploring Wicklow and the very charming village of Enniskerry, but the hotel was so fabulous, we couldn't drag ourselves out of the estate once we were inside.  The grounds are great for exploring, and there are bikes and golf carts on site if you want to go farther afield.  The estate is very good for walkers and runners.

We felt very welcome here and will definitely be back.",5,2012,05,11
217,One Night Stay in May,"Stayed here as a treat for one night in May.
Booked a Mountain View Suite. The view and the room were fantastic.

The staff were very friendly, and helpful throughout.

I ate at the Sugar loaf lounge for lunch, and Gordon Ramsay for dinner. Both were lovely.

Expensive, but worth it as a treat.

All in all a very enjoyable stay.",5,2012,05,09
217,I love this hotel! Everything just works.,"We stayed here for the second time recently and enjoyed it just as much as the first. I'd forgotten what it was like to go to a hotel where everything works the way it should and there are no niggling, annoying issues to put customers off.

Check-in is efficient and friendly, but not as pompous as other 5 star hotels try to be sometimes. Most of the staff just seem to be nice, helpful Irish people who want you to enjoy your stay. We had a suite as it's so handy for our little one to be able to go to bed early behind the bedroom doors while we watch television in the sitting room. I think it's a very child-friendly hotel and our daughter always enjoys the activities in the playroom. 

Our best food experience was probably in the bar downstairs, where dinner was much better than the meal we had in the Sugar Loaf lounge upstairs. The buffet breakfast in the main restaurant is absolutely fine. 

We'll be back again soon for another visit.",5,2012,05,08
217,Consistently superb,"This is the third time we stayed at the Ritz-Carlton in Powerscourt and it will certainly not be our last.
We have stayed in other Ritz-Carlton hotels in the USA and this one is certainly one of the best.
Laurent came to meet us at our car and he clearly remembered our family from last year. We had an enjoyable chat, remembering events from our previous visit. He kindly gave us a suite with the mountain view.
We had absolutely no complaints at all. The hotel still is in a wonderful condition with no signs of wear and tear. The food and breakfast was of very high standard. All the staff were very helpful and courteous.
Special thanks to Kinga from Hungary (who we also remembered from last year) for her kindness and willingness to accommodate us. A big thanks also for Zsolt and Maurice",5,2012,05,08
217,Pure luxury,"Excellent service, beautiful gardens, gorgeous rooms. 

Just pure indulgence in every way.",5,2012,05,08
217,Spa lets the hotel down,"We stayed for a one night break over the May bank holiday. Our room was lovely. Great views of the sugarloaf. However we were looking forward to chilling out in the spa pool and to starting  our relaxing night away. Oh my lord, the pool was thronged with kids ranging from babies with nappies  up to age 8. They played ball, dived in screaming and shouting whilst the babies just cried and cried. We had to leave. Very disappointing. Such an amazing pool area to be ruined. Really annoyed to. The girls in the spa reception just laughed and said they had a headache too.  Shame really. ",4,2012,05,07
217,comfortable hotel in great location,Stayed here for 2 nights recently. The room was excellent & had a lovely view of the fountain. There was enough wardrobe space to stay for a year! The bathroom was well equipped & there was a separate walk-in power shower. We ate lunch in the Gordon Ramsey restaurant which cost €33 for 3 courses & delicious. My only criticisms were that the downstairs pub-style bar felt a bit dark & claustrophobic & have had far better breakfasts elsewhere though that may be down to be seated in foyer as overflow area when main room busy. Very comfortable hotel but not much character as it's very much up-market chain in style.,4,2012,05,06
217,"Ok hotel, disappointing food","It was the little things that let this five star hotel down. It took three hours to get cots for our four month twins (these had been requested at booking). The food in the restaurant was terrible, three star at best, we had to send two dishes back. The room was small, but had all modern features and technology. Beautiful spa and pool facilites.",3,2012,05,06
217,Just What We Wanted,"Spent 3 nights in a great suite. I would definitely splash out extra for suite again in the future. Staff were friendly, loads of room for kids to run around (inside and out)",5,2012,05,05
217,"Great hotel, poor restaurant,","Stayed here overnight.
lovely rooms lots of frills and nice touches etc. Spa great and staff very nice.
complaints were few, Do not eat in the restarant, cant belive Gordon Ramsey put his name to this. very poor!!!!
felt the hotel a bit stiff to be honest, but you dont go to the Ritz Carlton to have a party i guess!",4,2012,05,02
217,The bed wouldn't fit in my suitcase...,"That's the only complaint I have ever had, or most likely will ever have, about the Ritz.",5,2012,05,02
217,Great place but didn't get room I was meant to get,"Amazing place with helpful staff but I got a weekend booked for me as a present and went up on the date in question had a great time in the pool (amazing) and had a lovely time until I got back to be told that the person who had booked the trip had paid for a certain room which I didn't get, other then that it was great. ",5,2012,05,01
217,Great stay in excellent property.,"We stayed here last weekend as an anniversary treat, check in was very smooth, a wedding party arrived before us, a member of staff took us aside and checked us in. This was a very nice touch.

We were shown to our suite, which was top notch. A very large suite, with extensive storage and luxury bathroom.

Spa treatments and pool were availed of and all up to a high standard.

Dinner was eaten in the Gordon Ramsay restaurant, which was good, not great, see review.

Breakfast was ok, pretty standard for a hotel breakfast to be honest. We expected more but it was nice.

All in all a great stay in a wonderful hotel which is sadly showing signs of wear and tear now that it is 6-7 years old. A paint job and some maintenance would not go a miss.",4,2012,04,25
217,Putting on the Ritz,"My one night stay was really an outstanding experience.  The setting, the staff, the room spectacular), the food, the spa; everything was as it should be for a 5 star luxury hotel.

It was a special occasion and the staff treated us very well.  Everyone working in the Hotel is to be congratulated on the level of service provided.  All our interactions were friendly and efficient and people genuinely seemed to want to assist.  There was no over the top formality or pretension that can be found in hotels at this level and I was very impressed.

The check in was great, (including a room upgrade, thank you), the room itself was an oasis of luxurious calm and extremely well appointed.  Dinner in the Gordon Ramsay restaurant was superb, a good selection of well thought out plates, each offering good local ingredients with a little bit of flair.

My wife used the Spa and was very impressed with her treatment and the staff were extremely helpful to both of us.

We really didn't want to go home; so after checking out we stayed to have lunch which was extemely good. It took all our will power to leave without attacking the cake trolley which looked fantastic.

The downside of all of this luxury and quality is the price.  The Ritz-Carlton is not cheap and were it not a very special occassion I would not have paid that much. However, having experienced the Hotel I can honestly say that you get what you pay for and it is good value.

I am already trying to come up with another ""special"" occassion so I can arrange returning for another stay.",5,2012,04,25
217,Excellent and friendly service in lovely surroundings.,The staff went out of their way to welcome us. A really great service was provided. The room was spectacular and the food was delicious. No complaints whatsoever.,5,2012,04,24
217,Mixed bag - parts are a 5 and parts are a 1.,"Let's start with the bad to have it out of the way: 

The spa is poor at best. The staff is too busy doing little or nothing to even show you were the various facilities are located. Find a locker and be lucky enough to have a robe in it would be a bonus.

A garden view is just that a big wall with a garden setting - not worth looking out at.

Staff in the Sugarloaf Restuarant are very unattentive - we waited 15 minutes after seating to be greeted even though they had time to talk to each other.

The good:

Trish, the concierge is delightful and so very helpful. Wonderful Irish lilt in her voice as well.
Matt, the bar tender has a wonderful personality and makes a visit worthwhile.
Michael, A bellman, will remember you from the first moment and is willing to gout out of his way to help.
The River walk is worth the time and effort to come back up the hill. Get Trish to get you some bikes for an leisurely ride along the river below.

View of the Sugarloaf mountain from the Sugerloaf bar is relaxing and beautiful.

The rooms are large and well appointed as you would expect at the Ritz.

Now the BEST: If you are lucky enough reserve the Gordan Ramsey Restaurant Chef's table. We asked Trish and she said it was booked that night but later called to tell us the newlyweds that had reserved it had asked us to join them. It is located inside the kitchen so you can see everything that is happening. We had time to tour the kitchen and the Chef came by our table to talk several times. It was one of the most wonderful dining experiences I have ever had. We are so grateful that the newly weds asked us to join them; Thank you!",3,2012,04,23
217,"Room nice, view of parking lot not so nice","Don't consider staying here without getting a mountain view room. The ""garden view"" is a view of the parking lot. Very ugly and not well thought out. They could have had all of the parking subterranean and turfed over the top and had a decent view, but they must have run out of money. On the other hand, the room was big and luxurious and the bed was very comfortable. The pub, which is only open part of the week was ok, the breakfasts were not what i would have expected from a five star hotel and service was not that friendly. We had dinner in the Sugarloaf Lounge and it was good.  I would recommnd eating lunch at Avoca at Powerscourt House next door or at the visitors bar at the golf club across the street. The seafood chowder there was wonderful. Be aware there is no ATM in the village and the one at Powerscourt House was down all 4 days we were there. We were on a 3 nights for 2 package, but even then overall, it was not worth the money. Very disappointing.",3,2012,04,21
217,"Amazing breathtaking views, with excellent service!","Stay in this venue last weekend, both myself and my husband were blown away by not only the hotel it's self and it's outstanding views, but also the customer service. We step out of our car only to be greeted by the staff to collect our bags and after checking in, showing us to our room, it was our anniversary and they had upgraded us to an king size deluxe suite with chocolates and a beautiful card on arrival. I could not flaw this hotel the food was outstanding in both the sugarloaf and Gordon Ramsay restaurant, including the breakfast. 
We were too late to book any spa treatments, but did use the pool, and hot bath which was amazing. The only downfall with the spa was if you were willing to spend the extra 25 euros upstairs the men and females section were separated, which kind of defeated the purpose of going away with your partner for the weekend. 
Loads to do around the area as well, sadly the day we went it was raining but you have the powers court gardens, powers court house, along with a short drive to the powerscourt waterfall. The Powers court Waterfall was beautiful, however even with the rain there was about 20 BBQ going on, and a few car with heavy music playing which I found slightly took away from the venue itself.",5,2012,04,18
217,Wonderful hotel,"Just stayed here for three nights with our three small children (5, 3 and 5 months) and thought it was excellent. We booked a suite with a kitchen, which gave us loads of space, as well as privacy for parents. The kitchen was big enough to accommodate the baby's cot at night, which essentially gave us a third bedroom. Staff were brilliant throughout, as were all the facilities - spa and games room included. One small gripe would concern the bar - we ate there one evening and thought it was quite poor. Breakfast in the restaurant, on the other hand, was really good.",5,2012,04,16
217,Expensive but (if you can handle the guilt for extravagance in a recession) so worth it!,"Fantastic location, fantastic room, fabulous pool, delicious food, lovely staff.  In fact friendliness of staff has increased compared to our last stay here 3 years ago.. No room for snobiness anymore thankfully! Cannot recommend this hotel enough.. Worth upgrading to a mountain view.  Children seem to be welcome now too. If you need a treat 2 nights here will sooth your soul.. 2 nights so you can enjoy it all the more!",5,2012,04,16
217,The Best!  Excellent hotel~  My best Ritz experience,"My family and I wanted to tour Wicklow and the Ritz made it even better.  A beautiful property with a view that is one of the best you will see.  They upgraded us to Jr. Suites and they were fantastic.  The Concierge provide us great ideas for a tour. Breakfast was 1st class and delicious.  We ate a Gordon Ramsey's at the Chef's table and it was an experience.  

The GM met us twice and was very accommodating. ALL of the staff was helpful and very friendly.

Its not a far drive from Dublin and puts you in the most beautiful area.",5,2012,04,16
217,An excellent hotel.... But 4 stars not 5 this time....,"This was our fourth stay at the Ritz-Carlton Powerscourt. We are a small family of 2 adults and a toddler and have stayed at the Ritz-Carlton over the last 2 years in both the suites and standard deluxe rooms. We were lucky enough this time to be able to leave or daughter with grandparents who lived locally - one of the many reasons that this hotel ticks so many boxes for us!
I am from south Dublin originally so this is always my first choice of hotel. I rarely stay in the city centre however if I did, and was alone, I would possibly pick somewhere else such as the Shelbourne or Four Seasons (as a 5 star alternative) 
I won’t go into much detail about the location of the hotel as other reviews have covered this  - suffice to say it is within quiet, private and secluded grounds with one of Irelands most prestigious golf clubs on site.
Our most recent trip was over Easter and we choose to book a suite this time as the rates we looking quite favourable. Having been lucky enough to travel quite and bit and stay at some incredible hotels around the world, this room was certainly one of the most impressive both in size and quality. The suite, as you would expect, was split into bedroom and living/dining area. However one of the most striking aspects was that the room had its own self-contained kitchen. I'm not talking about some little pokey corner containing and fridge and sink = this kitchen was a full sized room in itself with integrated oven, hob, full sized fridge, fully stocked integrated Siemens coffee and espresso machine. Clearly this kitchen was designed to cater for guests that wanted to host their own in room dinner party and perhaps hire in-house catering staff as there was also a independent entrance to the kitchen next to the main room entrance. The coffee machine was emptied and filled with fresh water and coffee beans every morning. The room also had its own walk out balcony with sun loungers = although the paving slabs could do with some attention.  The bathroom was also a generous size - walk in shower, bath separate toilet area, mirror with mirror lcd tv etc. 
Each time we stay at the Ritz we generally eat at least once at the Gordon Ramsey  restaurant. Although the food and service is generally excellent they were doing an Easter dinner set menu that we didn’t want to avail of so it seemed to cause some confusion for the waitress when we ordered from the normal menu.  
My wife availed of the Spa – massage and pedicure. As usual, she scored this experience 10 out of 10! One tip here though… when I booked the hotel I also booked the spa treatments for her. This came to a total of €175 for both sessions which would last approx. 2hours (I think?) however for the same money she could have booked the “day spa treatment” which would have given her two treatments plus lunch and full use of the facilities for the whole day. This should have been mentioned at the time of booking to me but wasn’t as the Spa seems to operate as a separate department/entity - this seems to be a breakdown in communication between the spa and the main hotel. However I did address this directly with the spa prior to my wife attending and they rectified this without any problems. 
Why do I rate this hotel a 4 and not a 5?
Firstly, I love this hotel. I very much recommend you visit and we can’t wait to visit it again… However there were certain experiences that can’t go without mention and these mostly centralised around the staff. The staff are clearly well trained and extremely professional, they listened and were always polite and courteous to us and anyone that we saw. 
At times though it did seem that when I enquired or made requests about certainly things I felt that my words were somehow “getting lost in translation” – at times I felt a lacking ability to fully understand my request or enquiry or when they did it was incorrect. 
For example, when we checked in, I stated that we might request a rollaway bed as our daughter might end up having to stay with us. We did not need it, but it still arrived on the 3rd night unexpected, or the whole issue over the spa costs – hotel staff didn’t understand my enquiry so had to go to the spa myself to sort it out, or the single chip that was under our table as we sat to dine for lunch – I mentioned it but it was never acted on. 
I stress these are very minor things and it was a busy weekend for them – I suspect they had to get extra staff in, but little things like this have a habit of mushrooming if left unchecked.
In summery… visit the Ritz-Carlton Powerscourt - it’s a hotel that Ireland should be very proud of!",4,2012,04,16
217,Another amaxing stay,"Returned to the Ritz for the second time in couple of years, bringing friends to celebrate joint special birthdays.  What a hotel, again everything was truely amazing, from our suites, to the food at Gordon Ramsay's to the staff, top notch, exactly what you would expect from a 5 star hotel.  We were even treated to a wonderful tour of the Gordon Ramsay kitchen which was an experience.  Will be back.",5,2012,04,16
217,True Five Star Experience,"We recently had the opportunity to stay at The Ritz Carlton Wicklow and it certainly delivered a true five star experience. We dined in both restaurants which we thoroughly enjoyed. I can also recommend the Spa, the pool area is great and really quiet so you can enjoy a nice relaxing swim. Our room was excellent, definitely have room service breakfast it was faultless. Well done to the team at The Ritz we cant wait to come and stay again soon!",5,2012,04,15
217,Great hotel for family with a spectacular spa,"We spent five days at the Ritz Carlton, Powerscourt with our young family.  The hotel is huge, and set on a private estate, with Golf, Powerscourt House, grounds and waterfall on your doorstep.  The rooms were beautiful, very comfortable and spacious and decorated to a high standard that you would expect of a five-star hotel.  There are three restaurants to choose from: Gordon Ramsey, The Sugarloaf lounge and McGills, the Irish pub.  Gordon Ramsey was OK, but not spectacular, the Sugarloaf was fine, perhaps a little overpriced for the children, and McGills is what it is: a pub with no frills, but good food.  I found it too dark and a bit dingey and preferred the light and airy sugarloaf for drinks and less formal food, but that's simply my preference.

The garden is not huge, and frustratingly, you have to go to the lower level of the hotel for access.  It is effectively accessed near the spa / gym level with no area for drinks / to eat while you watch your children play.  The garden is set up with a giant chess board and two football goals, but I ended up not particularly encouraging the children to play outside given that there was no place for the parents to sit and watch comfortably, coupled with the fact that the weather was freezing!  It would make so much more sense to have a dining area / bar area on the ground floor that would open up to the garden.  
  
What really makes this hotel is the fact that it is right next door to Powers court, a beautiful stately home with spectacular gardens and the fabulous Avoca shop / cafe.  We had lunch there pretty much every day as the food is superb.  You can hire bikes and cycle around the estate, and the hotel concierge are very, very helpful is suggesting walks / hikes / jogging routes and other activities in the area.  There is a great riding stable a five minute drive away and so you are really not going to be short of things to do.    

The Spa is incredibly and would surpass many Four Seasons.  Children are allowed to swim in the indoor pool from 0900 until 1800, and mine were enchanted by the tiny lights decorating the interior of the pool.  However, there were so many children staying in the hotel when we were there over the Easter break that the hotel could have done with another pool strictly for adults wanting to swim lengths.  I felt sorry for anyone wanting a proper swim as you would not have been able to do even a width without bumping into children.  There is an floor above the pool area dedicated to the spa.  A wonderful ""serenity"" room and beautiful  treatment rooms.  I got the impression that there were many people coming specifically to spend the day at the spa.

All in all a great hotel, which I would highly recommend for families.",5,2012,04,11
217,Wonderful,"Stayed here to finish out our tour of Ireland.  Got a decent deal through Amex (check hotels website for all offers).  Room was huge. more closet space than home.  Lobby was beautiful. Staff extremley friendly and helpful.  Another big draw was Gordon Ramsey's restaurant.  Apps and desert were great, main course ok. Dis not go into town but hotel staff will drive you there and pickup.  Central to Glendalough, Wicklow Mountains, Powerscourt Gardens, and Dublin airport.",5,2012,04,09
217,Superb !!,Really enjoyed a night here over Easter. The deluxe room (5th floor) was fantastic. The food in McGills is reasonably priced and very tasty. The Gordan Ramsay restaurant is also superb. Will definitely be returning in the near future !,5,2012,04,09
217,Pure luxury!,"If you like the finer things in life then this is the place for you!  This was our fourth visit and we return time and again because we believe it to be the finest hotel in Ireland. Everything about this place oozes class and luxury, and for those who complain about the price they should really bear this in mind.  Staff know how to treat guests and make them feel important, and this is true from the check in experience onwards.  Location is amazing too - in the grounds of Powerscourt Estate, which is just superb.  If you want to pamper yourself then look no further - this truly is the place to go.",5,2012,04,09
217,Look forward to going back,Lovely staff. Quick check in and check out. Great room. Beautiful leisure facilities. Stunning scenery. Excellent breakfast. We stayed there for St Patrick's day. As a nice tough they had left some shamrock on a pin in our room but there were two of us-two pins would have been better. We were asked if we'd like daily newspapers and we said yes but we never got them. Also on our first night a pipe burst outside our room and my partner had to complain to reception at 4am as they we're hoovering outside our room. We got no apology or real explanation but for the rest of our stay there was a drying machine at our door.,5,2012,04,05
217,Fantastic!,"Beautiful and lovely in so many ways...A grammy, mom and daughter/grand-daughter (9yo) stayed here and all loved it!  It was first class with all of the amenities and service one expects at a Ritz.  The mountain view suite was perfect and the pool was so cool!  It has black tile so it is most interesting and yet very relaxing. And a TV in the bathrooom mirror...awesome! The hotel is in a lovely residential and woody area south of Dublin and an easy 30 minute drive the airport which was a great way to cap off a ten day trip to Ireland.",5,2012,04,01
217,Best experience during three-castle vacation,"My wife and I spent two nights at Powerscourt, Ashford and Dromoland during March, 2012.  The vacation setup was via Scepter Tours.  The deal with Scepter, including Aer Lingus flights from Chicago, Dooley car rental, and three two-night stays were handled perfectly, as promised by Scepter.  Through Scepter and Aer Lingus, we tweaked the original flight for $40 extra to obtain emergency row seating.  That required finding out the seats were available through Aer Lingus and then going back through Scepter to complete the upgrade.  Scepter handled the upgrade quickly and competently.  The upgrade itself -- for a six-hour flight -- was an outstanding value.

Powerscourt was the best facility among the three, hands-down.  All three had very good /  competent / friendly staff.  The outdoors area at each were beautiful.  Ashford and Dromoland, though, are older facilities.  Powerscourt had larger suites, more rooms per suite, better showers, hot water for tea or coffee available in the suite itself, a refrigerator (unlike the castles) in the room, and things like ice available down the hall without having to go through room service.  Powerscourt even had a transformer in the room for making power available to USA appliances (my laptop cord).  Again, the staff and grounds at each were all first-rate. 

There is a free car service for going to the village, but my wife and I walked to and from the village.  The grounds were beautiful, and the walk was very do-able.

I have been to Ireland several times.  This was the first time at a castle or highly rate hotel.  The only caveat I would add to the foregoing is that, for me anyway, Ireland is a lot more about interacting with the Irish people than with luxury hotels, spas or golf courses, as such.  If I were to visit Ireland only once, I would stick with B&B's.  You get far more interaction with the Irish people at a B&B than at a castle or hotel.",5,2012,03,31
217,Beautiful inside and out!,"When we arrived on the grounds of this hotel I could not imagine that the hotel could match the beauty of the gardens and hills surrounding it, but somehow it did!  Excellent service, beautiful guest rooms  (especially suites), great food.  There is free wifi and they will drive you down to the little village and pick you ip anytime you want to go.  The grounds are wonderful for walking.  Of course, there is also golf.  There is golf on the property, but also other courses in close proximity .  The European Club is only about 30 minutes away, as are several other fine golf courses.  This may be the nicest 5 star hotel I have ever stayed in.  The hotel is about 45 minutes from the Dublin Airport.",5,2012,03,30
217,A little Oasis out of Dublin,"Great welcome and hospitality. Food excellent and service good indeed. Bedrooms great size as standard and spa excellent. It seems quite quiet so some deals to be had i am sure.

Great estate to wander around especially around the river!!!",4,2012,03,30
217,A treat,"We really enjoyed our stay both for hotel & location. We stayed in a mountain view suite & had a beautiful view, the room itself was clean & tastefully appointed (a little old fashioned decor for some people but in keeping with the hotel). The tv in the bathroom was great & plenty closet space! However the Mini bar prices were extraordinary & the tea/coffee options in room were poor. We ate in both sugar loaf & Ramsey restaurants & enjoyed both evenings & had very good service in the Ramsey restaurant. The shuttle service to enniskerry was great on a rainy evening & the concierge Trish & porters/bell 'men' were really helpful. We had a breakfast room service on 1 morning & it was very expensive with €8 being charged for a tiny bowl
Of cereal! Great visit for a treat!",4,2012,03,27
217,Such a disappointment for our special occasion,"This was our third time staying in this beautiful hotel, prior to this we had really loved every aspect of this hotel.

Because my fiance had always found this hotel really special, I had planned on proposing to her in the hotel suite when we returned this year. I had spoken with the hotel on 2 occasions before our arrival to organise for flowers and champagne to be delivered to our suite explaining the intention to get engaged. I had spoken with the reception staff and the conceirge. 

The hotel facilitated an early check-in which was very much appreciated, my fiancé headed to the spa. The champagne was delivered to our suite at the requested time, however there was no sign of the bouquet of flowers. 45 minutes later, I spoke with concierge who told me ""the flowers were already sent up to your room"", clearly they hadn't!! Shortly afterwards the flowers arrived, just moments before my girlfriend arrived back to the suite -stress!

It is important to mention that at no point did any member of spa or reception staff make any effort to make my fiancé feel special on this wonderful occasion. My fiancé was asked by two members of staff in the spa if she had been there before. She had been there at least 5 times before! She had been there less than 2 months earlier and had treated two family members to treatments there! She had noted spa staff wish other guests a lovely stay and a happy birthday etc., in the spa cafe whilst eating lunch, however there were no such wishes expressed to her, in fact, she felt as if she was ""in the way"".

Prior to dinner, we waited outside the conceirge office for over 5 minutes hoping to ask her to take a photo of us to mark the occasion. We were completely ignored as she was deep in chit chat with 2 ladies. In the end, we gave up and the very pleasant doorman took the photo. 

When eating dinner in the restaurant, my fiance made it clear to me how unwelcome she felt in the hotel. Given that we had stayed there twice before, and used the hotel spa and restaurants each time, we were treated as if we were complete strangers. We noted that other diners were  presented with decorative desserts to mark their birthday. Given the fuss made of other guests, it really made us both feel humiliated and treated at a level below other guests.

The lovely waitress, Laura, must have overheard us and very promptly wished us her congratulations on our engagement. It was delightful to see at least 1 member of Ritz Carlton staff acknowledge how special the occasion was for us. We were then presented with a decorative dessert from another member of waiting staff wishing us a ""happy anniversary"" - no joke! When leaving the restaurant, the only comment from the maitre d' was "" have you signed for the bill already?"" 

We had a wonderful break, as always the hotel is beautiful and staff in general were pleasant. However, given our loyalty to the hotel, I'm really disappointed at how there was no acknowledgement of our special occasion. 

We certainly would never have our wedding reception in this hotel after seeing how insignificant we were made to feel.",2,2012,03,25
217,Afternoon was very disappointing!!,"Myself and my girlfriend decided to treat ourselves to some afternoon tea at the Ritz Carlton. When we arrived we were stunned by the gorgeous lobby area and the view was out of this world. Sadly that was the peak of our stay. We (maybe our fault) had intended to share the afternoon tea and I thought I was clear to the waiter when ordering that we were going to order just one afternoon tea and we would share that platter. The sandwiches were nice however too many seafood options. I would of preferred a larger variety of choices. Our waiter started off quite well however, half way thought he disappeared. Our new waitress(a manager i believe) was quite nice too, however when I ordered some more tea and coffee and more milk I never received it. As we were running late for an appointment I didn't bother mentioning. I ordered the bill and that is when I learnt we had ordered two afternoon tea's. As this may have been my fault I did not bother to bring it up as well. However I would recommend they make a little easier for people to understand this.",2,2012,03,20
217,very impressed,"Stayed last week at this hotel and all i can say is that the hotel is of real 5 star standard the staff were of the highest professional standard,  in this area my wife and i must say a great thanks to the two ronnies in the front hall area who were of great help to us as were all the staff we encountered,we had a great stay the spa area was top class ,the gardens ,the bar area and music ,the suite we stayed in was to the highest level of any great hotel that we have stayed in over the years ,the breakfast was vast and fresh and service to offer what ever you may wish ,again from my wife and i and our friends who joined us a sincere thanks to all for a great stay .",5,2012,03,20
217,"3rd Visit - Amazing Property,","Stayed here for 3 nights at the end of February 2012. Had a romantic d days/nights with my partner and then had family come down and stay on the Sunday! The hotel is so luxurious and the overall atmosphere is fantastic. I love luxury and have stayed in many hotels, in fact, this was our 3rd time returning to the property. we were upgraded to a Mountain View Suite and the fresh macaroons and hand written note on arrival were thoughtful. The suite was fabulous as before and the food although on the expensive side, this is of course to be expected of a 5* property was very tasty. Breakfast was filling and satisfying also and service throughout was attentive and warm. We dined in the Irish Bar and The Sugar Loaf Lounge for both dinner and lunches, and the food was well made and very plentiful. The fish and chips is to die for, as is the burger and bangers and mash! The cocktails were amazing but at €22 a pop, are certainly a treat, I indulged in several, and found the Luxury Mojito to be outstanding. We availed of the on site bikes and took a trip to Avoca, within the Powerscourt Resort in the hotel grounds. I would especially like to mention the staff that took care of our housekeeping, the attention to detail surpassed anything else I had experienced, they noted the books we were reading and the page we were at and inserted book marks for us! What attention to detail! Also the chap who seated us outside the wine bar and fetched us blankets, lit the fire and advised us on the wine choices was very professional indeed. 
I would like to inform guests that upon check in, each guest has €150 per room per night pre authorised for in resort expenditure, the full amount is then taken again on check out the the €150 nightly charge is refunded several days later. You may wish to keep this in mind to avoid any embarrassing situations at check out. All in all, we had a pleasant stay and would recommend this fabulous resort to other travellers.",5,2012,03,20
217,Like a Dream,"Stayed here for two nights over the St Patrick's weekend and it far exceeded my expectations. The staff more extremely helpful and attentive. The ambience and setting of the hotel is second to none and you can't help but feel an overwhelming feeling of relaxation the minute you set foot inside.

The swimming pool and spa is exactly like it looks in the pictures - absolutely pristine.

The rooms are spacious and comfortable and my favourite part was having a panel beside my bed to control everything in the room from turning on and off the lights to closing the curtains!

The tv in the mirror of the bathroom is also an added treat!

The highlight of the trip was the experience and atmosphere in McGills Pub. The staff, service, food and drink here are top rate. The only dissapoitnment was the result of the Ireland v England rugby match that they were showing on the TV!

I can give nothing but top marks to The Ritz-Carlton Powerscourt. In fact, I enjoyed it so much that my girlfriend and I will be returning in less than 3 weeks time for Easter.

I must also give a special mention to Ciaran from the trundown team who offered a live demonstration of how to turn towels into swans! He was fantastic.

Also, Sean from McGills pub ensured that our St Patrick's Day was one to remember!",5,2012,03,20
217,Fabulous Hotel!!,"My husband treated my to a night in this hotel for my birthday, and it was a fabulous stay.
The staff were very nice and professional - the service is second to no other hotel that we have stayed in.
We were upgraded to a suite and it was fabulous, it was huge, the bed was very comfy and room was full of technology.
We had lunch in the bar downstairs and it was delicious, lovely bar!
The pool and steam room areas were great we really enjoyed the relaxed atmosphere and the clean facilities, the supersized jacuzzi was also very nice!  
We had dinner in Ramsays and it was fabulous, the food was delicious, service was great.
We finished our day in the sugarloaf lounge for some cocktails, which was very nice also.
We had a comfy nights sleep and the breakfast was great! 
Overall we had a fabulous stay,this was five star luxury and pampering at its best!!!!!",5,2012,03,18
217,Wonderful!!,"We just got back to the states from a week long vacation in Ireland. We stayed at the Ritz the first and last night of our vacation. This is one of the nicer Ritz's that I have stayed in. Very up to date technology, converter plugs, the works. The bathrooms are incredible..TV in the mirror, great shower and spa tub. Beds were very comfy. The first night our room was kind of hot, but the second night it was better. Must try the McGill's pub downstairs...best food of the whole trip. Very helpful and friendly staff!",5,2012,03,14
217,Perfect retreat,"Had a lovely stay at the Ritz Carlton.  The staff were helpful and very welcoming.  
The bedroom was a fraction old-fashioned, but it was gorgeous all the same.  The bathroom had a bath and a rainshower; two sinks and a TV set in the mirror. (Very useful!)
The bedroom had a double door to a balcony, overlooking rich green countryside. The peace and quiet was just blissful. 

There is a gorgeous swimming pool and hot pool.  Children are welcome at the hotel so the pool wasn't as peaceful as I would have liked!  I went back to the pool in the morning and found my serenity then. 

We decided not to eat in the hotel but go to Enniskerry village instead (just a few minutes drive).  On enquiring whether we would like to make a reservation for dinner, the hotel offered to provide a courtesy car to take us to dinner and afterwards returned to collect us when we were ready.  Now *that* is 5-star service. 

My only small crib is that the balcony wall outside is in need of a fresh lick of paint. Aside from that, the hotel is perfectly maintained and very comfortable.",5,2012,03,14
217,Great Hotel A+ Staff,"My New Husband and I stayed at The Ritz Powerscourt in Mid January for 5 nights for our Honeymoon. Unfortunately we were delayed in an airport for 24 hrs and missed one of our nights at the Ritz but the hotel experience made up for our delay 110% which was refreshing as AirLingus decided not to redit us in any way.
Upon arrival, very early in the morning we were greeted with smiling faces that checked us in and took us  us off to our beautiful suite. The room was more like a small apartment and although we didn't have the greatest view we were not bothered. The hotel staff also left us a beautiful bottle of champagne to toast our arrival.
We did have our rental car because we have family in Dublin areas and thought it might be a good idea to rent one. We both feel next time we will not rent a car because the Hotel is located just a short cab ride to the Dart train that takes you into Dublin central and if you only want a quiet meal in Enniskerry the Hotel will drop you off and pick you up after.
The Spa is amazing I recommend a treatment and dip in the pool. After your treatment take a nap in the relaxation room and have some water therapy.
The food was great, we did not get to try Gordan Ramseys because it was booked but we had just as nice meal in the Wicklow lounge and yummy pub grub in Finn McCools. We had cousins come and stay the Saturday Evening and we all had a great time and went up to Johnny Foxes. They noted that the price of the food and quality was a great price considering we were in the Ritz. 
If you are looking for nightlife you are a bit far out for dancing or anything but you will get pub music and great laughs.
We did go at a very cold time of year but it made the views that much more real and beautiful. We took a drive in the mountains, visited the waterfalls and went to the estate but did have to bundle up!
I must say the after service from the Hotel was amazing. I called the Hotel about a charge to my credit card and they remembered us by name and asked how our trip was home. They even offered to call me back in the states as not to run up the bill!!
Over all we will be back very soon and have nothing but the best to say about this beautiful resort.",5,2012,03,11
217,Faultless,"We just arrived home after a night in the ritz to celebrate our anniversary. We cannot recommend this hotel enough. Set in one of the most picturesque corners of Wicklow this stunning venue is one of the best hotels we have stayed in. The staff are fantastic, this may be one of the few places in Ireland where you actually get customer service! They were welcoming courteous helpful and happy! 
Our room was spectacular- no complaints, beautiful suite, mountain view, perfect and super clean!
The sugar loaf lounge GnT amazing!!
Dinner in ramsays fabulous with superb sommelier. 
This is five star luxury and pampering and such a treat to experience.
Our favourite hotel and just on our doorstep too - even better!
The ritz rocks",5,2012,03,11
217,Top class service and above and beyond concierge,"We stayed at the Ritz-Carlton Powersourt in February 2012 and had a wonderful stay.  To top off the fantastic views, great food and relaxing spa, we were treated like royalty by the head concierge,  Robbie,  from the moment we arrived until we reluctantly left.  It seemed he couldn't do enough to make our stay enjoyable.  Sunday morning was spent having a leisurely breakfast looking out at the breathtaking views and then borrowed bikes from the hotel to cycle through the gardens (thanks for the maps Robbie!).  All in all a real treat.",5,2012,03,09
217,Excellent,"I had the good fortune of enjoying this wonderful hotel now for a Business  conference. The views and the facilities were excellent. Staff is very friendly and the room is spectacular. The fitness center is also excellent and the pool is a treat. 

Cycling around the place on local roads and to the Waterfalls was a delightful experience and the golf courses look  incredible.",5,2012,03,06
217,Fantastic,"We stayed here for a long week end last month. The setting is outstanding with views of Sugar Loaf mountain and the surrounding area. From check in to check out the service was excellent. The hotel is very large and no expense has been spared in the hotel's design and build - chandeliers in reception, tv integrated in bathroom mirrors, electronically controlled curtains, aqua di parma toiletries. We stayed in one of the suites on the top floor which was huge and beautifully decorated. The food was excellent with a good range of international dishes and locally sourced specialities. The hotel is about a 30 minute drive from the city centre but there is plenty of parking and we never had to wait more than 10 minutes for a taxi. The hotel was very quiet which is what we wanted but its sheer size and low number of guests meant that it lacked any atmosphere in some of the public areas (bars, restaurants etc). However, this didn't detract from a fantastic relaxing and luxurious week end.",4,2012,03,06
217,Awesome,"Everything was excellent.... service, room, location... 
We had not received our luggage on time from NYC and one of the girls at the front desk had no issue checking us in at 5 am (check is at 3pm) and also gave me lots of extra toiletries so we could brush our teeth and wash our faces before getting some jet lagged sleep. Very accommodating!",5,2012,02,28
217,Fantastic,"Well designed spacious hotel in a lovely location. Very relaxing. Great pool. The Gordon Ramsay restaurant serves great food. Our only criticism was there was too much salt used to season it.  We booked a corner suite which was a bit more expensive but well worth it. Staff and service in this hotel are also impeccable. Note however this is not in Dublin but is a country hotel with access to great countryside, gardens, golf etc.",5,2012,02,28
217,Not as good as expected,"Stayed here last weekend with my wife and we were looking forward to a relaxing few days.
Very good welcome upon arrival followed by a smooth checkin and excellent room. All as expected from the Ritz.

Disappointment crept in at afternoon tea stage. We expected a lot more considering the price of €35. 4 measly sandwiches and 2 scones does not represent value in afternoon tea. As ""experts"" in the area we suggest the Four Seasons for a real afternoon tea experience. We never mind paying top dollar as long as it represents value and this afternoon tea did not. Service etc was very good throughout.

Next annoyance came when we visited the pool area. It was full of kids. We know they are entitled to be there but there was just so many of them, it was so noisy and you couldn't swim from one end of the pool to the other without a child gettng in the way. A relaxing hour in the pool was replaced by a 5 minute swim followed by a quick exit. Grrrrrr....

All in all we enjoyed our break but ultimately wouldn't return due to our two negative experiences highlighted above.",4,2012,02,28
217,"Lovely, luxurious spot but you pay for it","Myself and my partner recieved vouchers for here, so booked in for a one night stay with three course b&b. It was a lovely stay - very nice food in the relaxed sugar loaf restaurant (within the lobby), both dinner and breakfast was here and the food was very good. The bedrooms are great - very spacious with all mod-cons and very comfortable beds. Have had treatments in the spa before which are over-priced, so didnt have any this time. It is such a pity that children are allowed use the pool area in the spa - being indoor with low ceiling the accoustics are loud and you cannot relax if children are playing in the pool. Perhaps a seperate pool away from the spa? It is worth asking for the pass for the private access river walk - really lovely walk within the grounds. Overall this was a nice treat, but could get nice as nice food and service for half the price elsewhere.",4,2012,02,27
217,Excellent,"My wife and I stayed to celebrate our 40th Wedding Anniversary. The stay was a gift from our children. Fabulous hotel. Were upgraded to a suite which was magnificent. Staff were wonderful - friendly, helpful and attentive. Dinner in Gordon Ramsay Restaurant was outstanding.
Highly recommend and will be back soon!",5,2012,02,27
217,"Great Hotel, Poor Service.","This hotel is absolutely beautiful! The location is wonderful, the food is outstanding. The rooms are large, spacious and perfect. I had a mountain view suite, which really is just a view of the back lawn. I was on the 4th floor and yes, I saw the tiny tip of the Sugarloaf Mountain. The girl at the front desk (Pamela) told me if I was up on the top floor I would get a slightly better view of the mountain. The other suite option (not mountainview) looks at the parking lot. So “mountain view” was worth the extra cost. I visited Powerscourt House which was quite lovely. My only issue with this Ritz Carlton was the service was not up to par for a Ritz. The front desk girl (Pamela) was the only person during my entire stay who lived up to the Ritz Carlton name.  Otherwise, the service was horrible. It is a great hotel to stay at for the room and the ambiance, but if you are there for service and to be treated well, you are not going to get that at this hotel. Everyone from the front desk to the restaurant staff had an attitude of indifference. It is not a world class service hotel.   Next time I will stay at the Four Seasons in Dublin.",3,2012,02,25
217,Treated like a queen!,"Myself and my fiance stayed in this hotel at the start of February 2012, paid for by my sister as our engagement present.
We picked the Gordon Ramsey dining experience package and stayed for one night.
Our room was upgraded on our arrival as we had mentioned we were recently engaged.
The journey from Belfast was quick and easy. The hotel was stunning. We were delighted with it. My better half took himself across the road (literally a three minute walk) for golf which included a full irish breakfast (served at whatever time suits you).This cost 47 euro if booked directly from the hotel and he says it was one of the best courses he has ever played at. He has played a lotta golf courses.
Although we were early to arrive and our room wasn't ready until 1500 hrs, staff took me down to the spa where I was provided with everything, bathrobes, towels etc.
The pool and the hammam are amazing, apart from having to stifle my yawns listening to the pathetic conversations of the obviously very well to do members who were using the facilities.
It was all really relaxing. I decided not to use the spa due to their extortionate prices...and instead went on google before hand to find someone cheaper and local. BIG MISTAKE! I think I could have rubbed my own back better and I really don't think it was dermalogica stuff she used on my face...I didn't recognise the smell. So that was the biggest let down..but all my own fault. The hotel never suggested I use this girl. Her name was Sinead. Sorry Sinead, but my 11 year old brother could have done better.
Returning to the hotel I checked out my room!
SIXTH FLOOR HAS BALCONIES! Perfect for smokers. Our room was the biggest and best we have ever stayed in. We couldn't get over the TV built into the mirror in the bathroom.

The rooms have everything, I know you usually get mini shampoos and conditioners but they gave you mouthwash, nail set, lip balm etc. It was greaT!Staff brought up a bucket of ice for us also, and we had brought ourselves a bottle of wine wuth us to help keep within budget!

Dinner really was the best part. We arrived at the GR Ramsey and were met by two waiters. Fabio was the wine guy. He was really charming, brought us into the wine storage and actually allowed slippy fingers me to handle bottles of wine worth more than my monthly wage. He didn't make us feel silly by ordering reasonably priced wines and the food was so gorgeous I hadn't realised I was making Mmm noises whilst eating my desert until my fiance pointed it out to me. Haha! The restaurant is simply decorated and pretty. Service was the best we have ever had...same goes for the food.
The chef sent us out his recipe for the Bernaise sauce after we complimented him on it, and out waiter George brought us on a tour of the kitchens after we had finished our meal. George was probably the best and most informed waiter I have ever met, and gave a full explanation of the dishes before we selected our choice. It was the most well deserved tip we have ever given. 

We couldn't stop smiling and better still...when we arrived back at our room there were roses and rose petals on our bed.... We did a quick check to make sure we hadn't been billed for them (we hadnt). You can check your bill on their tv, free wifi.
The bath was gigantic..so we had a go in that! And the bed was so big that I lost him in the middle of the night but was too comfortable to continue rolling over towards him.

I'm so glad we got up for breakfast. The choice was massive! Fruits, yoghurts, salmon, cold meats, scones, pastries, bread rolls, james and full irish breakfast choices. I ate my body weight. It was immense. Once again the service was fabulous!

The only ATM in Inniskerry area is at Powerscourt House, 5 mins walk from the hotel in the private estate, take a left out of the hotel.
Plenty of parking. Super attentive staff. I would love to go back...so hopefully my sister will be generous again, becuase...I've had a week in Turkey for the money it cost for our room and our dinner. 
Brilliant excuse to get dressed up and be good to ourselves.",5,2012,02,22
217,Perfect,Had a perfect time in this hotel. The staff were SO friendly and helpful. If you visit this hotel you must visit The Powerscourt Gardens located in the same area as the hotel.,5,2012,02,20
217,Amazing....,"I stayed here for two nights with three friends and I could not fault my stay from start to finish. We were greeted at the door and our luggage was whisked away to our rooms while we checked in. We dined in the hotel all weekend, Gordon Ramsey's was fab but the other dining options were just as good. Great pool and facilites in the spa although on this visit we did not avail of any treatments. I felt fully relaxed when we left Sunday afternoon. The hotel itself is fab but the staff make it, each person we encountered were professional and friendly. Service levels are very high in this hotel. I would recommend and will return. ",5,2012,02,19
217,Incredibly friendly service,"Spent one night here, happened (unintentionally) to be the weekend before St. Valentine's Day.  Ordinarily we would never consider the forced romance of this date, but we had the offer of a babysitter!
The staff at this hotel are incredibly attentive and friendly (verging on just the right side of Stepford though!).  Our suite was superb, absolutely no complaints there.  Minor quibbles include (i) no mineral water (ii) no turn down and (iii) there was no where for pre-dinner cocktails.  The absence of a turn down service is something we have never seen in a 5-star hotel.  However, fresh towels and toiletries were sent up very soon after we requested them. The absence of a place to have a pre-dinner drink was possibly due to the ""pack 'em in"" Valentines special deal going on, so this may not be a problem on less busy occasions. Food was good, not amazing, but not bad value for money.
On balance our experience was almost perfect and deserving of a top rating, but let down by relatively small issues which should be addressed.
The ultimate question is would we return, and the answer is yes, but not around the dreaded St. Valentines weekend.",4,2012,02,17
217,Definitely Five Star,"After an exhausting week of business in Dublin, my partner and I decided to stay for two nights in Wicklow, which is my partner's ancestral home.  This was an incredible surprise.  Unlike other writers, I didn't think the outside was much to look at, and the grounds were very limited.  However, the hotel itself was elegant and beautiful, and as soon as you walk into the lobby, you see comforting wooden floors, open spaces, fireplaces and the view of Sugar Loaf.  Check-in was friendly and easy, and we were advised of an upgrade option, which actually cost us less.  Our room was more like a one-bedroom apartment.  There was a huge bathroom, closet-dressing room, living room and bedroom, all with view of the mountains.  No complaints about the room.  The beds were extremely comfortable.  We immediately decided to take a scenic drive through Wicklow, visiting Glendaloch, and the staff gave us a map with a marked course to follow.  When we returned, we unwound with a drink in the lounge on the far side of the lobby, enjoying the view.  Dinner in the Gordon Ramsey restaurant was special, with an interesting (but not weird) menu, and everything was delicious.  I was happy Gordon Ramsey wasn't there, because this visit was for stress reduction!  Next day after an amazing breakfast buffet, we drove to the Vail of Avoca.  We had dinner in the lobby bar, which was almost as good as the restaurant.  The final morning before we left, we visited nearby Powerscourt estate, which, if it hadn't been raining, we would have walked to.  At that point, I understood why there were no extensive hotel grounds.  How could they compete with Powerscourt?  Powerscourt was well worth the visit, with enormous scenic grounds, gardens, and ponds to walk by, in addition to a castle tower.  While this hotel stay was expensive, it wasn't outrageous, although we may have gotten a better rate because it was in January.  Definitely a recommendation.",5,2012,02,14
217,Perfect! Just perfect!,"We loved everything about this hotel... Room, staff, pool, food, location.... Perfect! ",5,2012,02,10
217,Amazing,"This is one of the most luxurious hotels that I have ever stayed at in my entire life!!! It is sooo elegant and classy. 
We upgraded to a suite and it was worth every penny! The bathrooms were amazing, best bed I have ever slept in and I loved their walk in closets!!!!
Customer service was excellent and their staff was so friendly. They even had a driver(I forget his name, Russian guy) drop us off into the village nearby so we could drink and pick us up afterwards!!!! He was really friendly.
 If I ever get the chance to return to Ireland, I would love to stay here again!

My only downfall is we had chosen this hotel to eat at Chef Gordon Ramsay's restaurant and it was closed for renovations and we weren't informed. (Nov. 2010)",5,2012,02,08
217,Love this place,First class experience.  Great staff.  Middle of nowhere.  Lovely village.  Gordon Ramsey restuarant equisite.  I will definately be visiting again,5,2012,02,02
217,excellent,"Stayed here for 3 nights for a conference. A lovely hotel, service is impeccable.  Food is great - we ate in Gordon Ramsays restaurant one night.  McGills pub is really good

My room had an lcd tv mounted in the bathroom mirror, heated marble flooring and remote control curtains and lighting. Amazing!

The spa is really nice too, the staff are great",5,2012,02,01
217,Our favourite hotel,"We've stayed in the Ritz-Carlton Powerscourt 3 times and regularly make day trips from Dublin to eat or for the spa. It is by far the best hotel we've ever stayed in. Service in the hotel, restaurant and spa is excellent. The rooms are extremely well maintained. We've eaten in the Gordon Ramsay restaurant twice but find the food in the bar to be just as good and a lot more affordanle. I regularly take my girlfriend there for her birthday and we plan to go back again and again.",5,2012,01,31
217,"Stunning gardens and walks, amazing value","The suite I stayed in was huge, comfortable, and had lovely views of sugarloaf.  The hotel is new (4 years old) and beautifully outfitted.  The pool and spa are especially stunning.  This is a wonderful base for exploring all the beautiful attractions at it's doorstep: gardens, walks, golf, Avoca shops and cafe---extremely scenic Irish countryside.  It's very easy to get here from Dublin.",4,2012,01,25
217,Romantic stay,"This hotel is as fantastic as you would expect. The lobby is gorgeous, views are amazing and our room was out of this world. We have a lovely time here, however it is very expensive. I have no problem with the room prices but the drinks and food therafter are extremely overpriced.

The spa is beautiful & we had a treatment(full body massage) that was good but not amazing. It too is VERY expensive.

Breakfast was average, buffet style. We ate dinner in the bar which was delicious and good value, however the drinks were very expensive. I ordered a mojito and it was 16euro (small enough) We got lunch the next day in the sugar loaf lounge, it was nice(not as nice as the bar food) and again very expensive.  The seating & table here were not ideal also.

Overall we had a fantastic stay and the hotel is beautiful however we did feel it was a bit too steep in may ways.",4,2012,01,25
217,Relaxed but expensive!,"We decided on a much needed break to the Ritz just after new year, with our 5 year old in tow.  The suite we had was luxurious but not 'cozy'.  Decorated in tones of blue and white.  The furniture in the living area whilst 'grand' was uncomfortable.  The kitchen was full sized and a bit of a waste due to the fact that there was no crockery, not even a cup, two paper cups were provided which I found tasteless and tacky, even in a basic hotel you get a proper cup!  This was rectified later when I requested a cup.  I can't see the point in providing a kitchen with no utensils to be honest.  The bed was very comfortable, however, I did request a feather free room and was disappointed to discover feather pillows, duvet and mattress topper.  The first night they changed the pillows to foam ones and said they would change the rest of the bedding the following day.  It hadn't been done the following day at 5pm, the room had already been serviced so I said not to bother.  We had dinner in Gordon Ramseys restaurant on the first night, VERY expensive, only a la carte available, no special dinner menu was offered, which I expected.  The food was mediocre at best, certainly not 5 star.  The hotel restaurant itself is actually in the main lobby area, which is a bit odd, but, the food there is better than the G.R. restaurant and more reasonably priced.  The hotel grounds are breathtaking, beautiful views and walks, and well worth a visit.  The leisure centre is lovely, relaxing, and pleasant.  Disappointing to find the pub within the hotel closed during weekdays and really would expect full facilities for a 5 star hotel.  Having said this, I did relax, I did enjoy it and I would go back, mainly because the staff there are so accommodating, pleasant and friendly.  They were especially good with our little boy, he loved them knowing his name and he was genuinely welcomed at the hotel.  We will return, IF, they put crockery and REAL cups in the rooms.",4,2012,01,22
217,Best spot ever,"We were down at the hotel to celebrate our engagement in Nov-09

Our experience began with our car being taken (valet parking) and bags brought to the room. We were booked into a garden view suite originally but were upgraded to a mountain view suite on account of the occassion.

The room was unbelievable! Two bathrooms, walk in wardrobe, sitting room, 2 plasma tvs, 6 foot bed, large bath, separte shower area and a tv built into the mirror of the bathroom! We also had a large balconey area which looked onto the grounds of the hotel - beautiful!

We had afternoon tea in the lobby. This was really nice and a nice touch with champagne with it.

Later that evening we went to the Gordon Ramsay restaurant. Again, top notch with lovely food and great service.

Breakfast in the morning was available until 10:30. Try and get there by 10 as there was a bit of a back log of people waiting for a table who arrived just before 1030. Breakfast was self-service with great choice and agin lovely food.

We had a look around the spa, gym and pool but didn't use these as we forgot our gym gear. The pool is gorgeous!

Our overall experience at this hotel was flawless from the facilities to the food and also the staff who were really excellent.

Worth the 5* !!",5,2012,01,17
217,"Excellent Rooms, Food and Service","After having spent NYE with friends in Dublin we stayed two nights at the Powerscourt to relax after the NYE festivities.

ALL staff members we met were extremely helpful, friendly and professional.
The rooms were very large and well equipped. HSK did a wonderful job, when they saw one of our slippers were broken, we immediately had new ones.
None the less there were a few incidents during our stay that I will describe below.

When going to bed on the first night we realized that one side of the bed was too soft and my partner seem to disappear in the mattress. We were sure that something was wrong with the mattress so we called the operator to ask for a solution (different room).
We were told that there were no more rooms with mountain view available and moving to another room in the middle of the night was not a pleasant option anyways. So the night manager assured us that he know what the problem is and they will take care of it, it won't take longer than 10 mins. We said ok. 
So 5 minutes later he was up with a room attendant and a new bedbox. We just spent ten minutes on the couch watching TV. It was fabulous how efficient they were with replacing the bed box. 

The other incident was during our dinner at Gordon Ramsay's. The quality of the food was ok but not extraordinary, still my partner's starter was not as promised on the menu (very oily) so we told the head waiter, who promised a new plate. Which we got pretty fast, but there was not difference. We would have loved to tell him that but he started avoiding our table! How unprofessional! It is really not a problem that something was not to our liking, but avoiding our table after a complaint is just plain unprofessional. At least the wine was on the house, as an apology.

Despite these two small events our stay was flawless and we will definitely return. 

I don't understand how people keep complaining about the F&B prices, for Ritz-Carlton they were pretty reasonable. We stay in Ritz- Carltons and Four Seasons around the world and one should expect these kind of prices at hotels of this category. In fact we are working in the industry and know the prices F&B get purchased by hotels, if I would constantly think about this I could never enjoy any hospitality experience.",5,2012,01,16
217,great place to stay,"My wife and I just got back and what a great stay we had. The Ritz was a great base for us to stay and travel the country of Ireland. When we got there, Pamela checked us in and she helped us almost every day with something. She was great at helping with all of our questions. Robbie which was our concierge for the Ist 3 days and was great. Very knowledgable with Irealnd, everything he told us to do was great. Finally, the door man Chris was full of ideas and great with directions.  The spa was a nice place to relax after driving the countryside. The rooms were large and very comfortable.",4,2012,01,11
217,Dublin couple,"Myself & my husband stayed in The Ritz back in November.  This was a birthday present for myself from my family.The drive into the Powerscourt estate is lovely, than head into the hotel grounds & your know you are in for a treat. The lady that checked us in was very friendly & helpful, another member of staff showed us to our room, he showed us how to use all the electronics, amazing. The room was just fab, I would actually say it was bigger than the downstairs of our house in Dublin, I think we got a suite as it was my birthday.  Walk in wardrobe, hugh writing desk, large comfy chairs, huge bathroom, built in television in the mirror, hugh bath tub, seperate shower & toilet. Huge big comfy bed.  I had a facial in the Spa & a swim in the pool, both amazing, the pool area is so relaxing. We had dinner in The Sugar Loaf, the food was divine, the steak was the best we have ever tasted & our waitress, I cannot remember her name, well she was so nice & had time to chat to us. We had a few drinks in the bar, the price of a vodka is a bit much, but its worth it.
Breakfast the next morning was also very nice.  As far as I remember it was €256 for one night bed & breakfast.  Well worth it when you consider The Shelbourne Hotel in Dublin are charging the same.

Something else I want to share - before our stay I did drive down to get some gift vouchers for someone else back in October.  The girl at reception that sold me the vouchers was just so helpful, the vouchers come in lovely packs, its a very nice touch & she also encouraged us to go down & have a look at the Spa & go for a walk around the hotel so we could go back & tell people what it was like. 
My husband had went into the Shelbourne Hotel in Dublin to book a room, he went up to reception, ask could he book a room & maybe get a print out to say it was booked as it would be for a present.  The girl at reception handed him the phone & told him to ring reservations!  Says it all!!
The customer service skills the staff at The Ritz Carlton have is second to none, friendly, polite & helpful.  Hopefully we will be back some day.",5,2012,01,10
217,Over priced and over hyped,"A mausoleum to the excesses of the Celtic tiger. A developer found himself with too much (borrowed) money and could not restrain himself when it came to spending it. A very hefty helicopter landing pad (even though 25mins drive from Dublin) sort of says it all.
The rooms are nice (we had a suite). Bathrooms could do with a little more bling for your buck. The bath for example was just bog standard - not the fancy tub for two you might expect with a suite. Rest of room simply average. Balcony is shared with all the other rooms so don't expect any privacy there. Also quite noisy AC when trying to snooze.
Gordon Ramsay restaurant was good not great. Food was average but the prices matched in fairness. Breakfast buffet was very good and had an excellent range.
Gin and tonic for two - €22. That really is just having a laugh at customers; bog standard gin with bog standard tonic. No doubt bought in for a total of about €4. This by the way was served in a dungeon of a twee Irish pub with American football blaring on TV in the background (any guesses who they're seeking to rip off?!).
We got engaged here. Mentioned it to the waiter and asked for two glasses of champagne. I ordered it, I had no problem paying for it. But really - to see it on the bill instead of on the house left me wondering if this place has the slightest clue about making a customer feel special or, as I suspect, if they simply are motivated to turn a quick buck without regard.
Nice neighbouring walks in beautiful settings. Gym, leisure centre also excellent and free to use for guests. 7 out of 10 but given the price and what you expect of a 5 star I'd downgrade it to 6/10.",3,2012,01,09
217,Superb,This is a truly superb 5 Star establishment. The entire experience has left each one of our 9 person group with a very positive memories. Top class in every aspect. We cannot wait to return. ,5,2012,01,07
217,Excellent rooms,"Excellent rooms, large and spacious although the beds are uncomfortable, lovely hotel, remote location, so may not suit everyone, lovely grounds.",4,2012,01,07
217,Truely Ritzy,"My husband and I stayed here as part of a conference he was attending. It was fabulous. We had a suite, which was larger than most North American one bedroom apartments. It was very swishy, with electronic panels that controlled the lights and curtains. 

We ate at the pub on site a couple of times. It was a little pricey, which was not surprising considering the location. The food was very good, the kitchen being one directed by Gordon Ramsay. 

This hotel is adjacent to the Powerscourt House, which is beautiful. We braved rain and gale force winds to wander around the grounds one day, which were beautiful. 

If you are looking at going into Dublin, a cab will run around 40€, so not cheap. Despite it's proximity to the city, I really enjoyed staying at the Ritz. I would definitely recommend it, particularly if you get a discounted rate. ",5,2012,01,07
217,Putting on the Ritz in Ireland,"We stayed at the Ritz Carlton Powerscourt (outside Dublin, Ireland) as part of a 10 day Sceptre 5-star independent tour of Ireland.  Without a doubt this is a best hotel we've ever stayed at. They upgraded us to a deluxe suite and in addition to the 2-room suite the bathroom was enormous with a huge tub and equally large glass shower.  Also, there was a separate dressing room that was as large as the bathroom.  Everything is super high tech, but with a wonderful luxurious style as well.  In addition, we ate a late lunch/early dinner at the on-site Pub and the food was really good and the service was great.  Would definitely recommend this hotel/resort to offers and look forward to returning.",5,2012,01,05
217,Best Hotel in Ireland!,"I travel a lot and stay in many fine hotels around the world! My favouite up to this point has been Encore at the Wynn Las Vegas, however that now has to share top spot with a hotel much closer to home: The Ritz-Carlton at Powerscourt, Wicklow, Ireland. Magnificant hotel. What a location...The views over the mountain and Powerscourt Gardens. Room was incredible. The most comfortable bed I ever slept in. Went for an upgrade with view and it was a spectacular room. Lots of great facilities in the hotel. Excellent Spa and also fitness area and pools. Didnt eat in the Gordon Ramsay restaurant as it was a last minute booking and we were too late to get a table. Food in the Sugar Loaf lounge was excellent. Staff very friendly and attentive. Breakfast was a little too busy and had to wait 10mins for a table but thats not a problem. Didnt realise the hotel was so busy until we went for breakfast so there must be great sound proofing in the hotel too! This is a Wonderful hotel in a Wonderful location.",5,2012,01,05
217,VERY FRIENDLY AND HELPFUL STAFF,"This was my third visit to this hotel and I think it was the best.    We got an upgrade to a lovely suite which was superb and very relaxing.    The hotel was fairly quiet when we visited so we enjoyed the pool and the jacuzzi.     The restaurant now has a wine bar attached which is really nice and I think the food in the Gordon Ramsay restaurant has improved and didn't seem as expensive as the last time.  The staff are always very helpful and pleasant,  The views are stunning here and I think its a very special setting,  no hesitation in recommending this hotel but you do need a car.",5,2012,01,04
217,Is it worth it?,"We enjoyed our weekend in the Ritz Carlton, although we paid dearly for it!  In general, we were very impressed with the hotel, and especially with the free upgrade that we received on arrival.  Our room was huge, and luxuriously appointed, and a lovely place in which to relax.  The bed was incredibly comfortable, and we had two great night sleeps.  The bathroom was gorgeous, with great fittings and plenty of towels, robes, and toiletries.  
In terms of food and meals, the pub is worth checking out for a quick dinner;  the food was a few euro more expensive than a normal pub, but we thought that it was definitely of better quality than usual.  However, the Gordon Ramsey restaurant's food, while very nice, was no better than any other very good restaurant that I have eaten in, and was not a particularly memorable experience.  In contrast, the hotel breakfasts were brilliant!  There was a massive range of food, all nicely prepared and presented, and very good service.  We also had afternoon tea once;  this was enjoyable, as much for the novelty as anything else, but we did not feel that it was worth the stiff E35pp that we were charged.  The quality was accepable, but I feel that I have certainly had better teas elsewhere.
In addition to the luxury of fittings etc, what really stood out for us was the level and degree of staff service at the hotel.  It was really excellent;  staff struck a nice balance between friendly and professional, although at times I longed not to be asked once again how my day was going!  Finally, we used only the pool, jacuzzi, and Turkish sauna in the spa, but would thoroughly recommend them.",4,2012,01,03
217,how the mighty are fallen,"I  recently spent  three days at this hotel when visiting Dublin on business . I had put my faith in the Ritz Carlton  brand  but, sadly, I am no longer a believer .  Avoid this hotel unless you like glacial service, absurd prices for mediocre food, a pub that does not open on Monday or Tuesday  and  a wine bar that opens randomly .  It is a Ritz Carlton which has forgotten the Ritz.",2,2011,12,29
217,Friendly Staff; Beautiful Scenery; Great Pool,"I stayed in the hotel for three week days during mid-December 2011.

Pros:
The area around the hotel has lots of natural beauty; I arrived in the early afternoon (before my room was ready), and the staff provided a high level map suggesting walks of various durations (all are pretty easy and not as lengthy as suggested by the map). In particular, the Powerscourt gardens are very beautiful and were one of the highlights of the trip. The Powerscourt estate itself and its focus on Avoca retail doesn't warrant much time.

Breakfast was plentiful, diverse, and of a high standard. The breakfast room had great views.

My room was very nice, large, and all aspects of it were comfortable.

The pool/spa/fitness areas are fabulous. The pool area in particular is gorgeous; it's one of the best indoor pools I've ever experienced - it looks just like the pictures provided by the hotel. The spa area is very relaxing, private, and has great views of the mountains. The pool/spa area are great places to spend time indoors when the weather outside doesn't cooperate (which unfortunately happened quite a bit during my visit).

Cons:
These aren't really cons, but minor annoyances.

I selected this resort as an accessible area outside Dublin to experience the Irish countryside a bit; I didn't want to rent a car because I didn't want to bother with it. However, I would suggest that you do bring a car unless you are only coming to the property for golf. You can't even get to the Powerscourt waterfall without a car (there are no sidewalks/walking paths to get to the waterfall). Having a car opens up a lot of possibilities and I hate to say this, but I got a bit bored during my three days without one.

The spa is very relaxing and has lots of nice touches (comfy seating with great views, a nice hot tub/sauna area). However, the treatments, although relaxing, were a bit disappointing. Perhaps this resort is catering to an older traveler who values relaxation over treatment, but I felt the treatments I had (a facial, body exfoliation, and moisturizing wrap) did nothing. Again, perhaps I'm just used to treatments that actually do something (i.e. exfoliation that actually exfoliates), but the services I had seemed kind of like a waste of money.",5,2011,12,28
217,Stunning,"Love this place!!!! This was my second time here. I spent 2 hours in the bath with a few beers watching sky sports. The mirror in the bathroom has a tv built in. Such a nice feature. The staff here could not do enough for us, so helpful and friendly. Granted this is not cheap, but its worth it!",5,2011,12,28
217,"a mausoleum to the ""Celtic Tiger""  years","The Ritz Carlton at Enniskerry is an excellent,provincial 4-Star hotel trying to pass itself as something it clearly  is not , namely a 5-Star hotel.  It is expensive but it has no class. For that elusive quality, try the Four Seasons  or the Merrion Hotel. Those hotels are shamelessly expensive but deliver the 5-star experience .
To be more specific 

1. The entrance facade of the hotel is awful, resembling at best a shoddy shopping mall
2. The hotel is filled with daytrippers and squads of loud, poorly supervised children 
3. The bar and restaurant facilities are limited  and  usually crowded with nonresidents
4. The swimming pool s monopolized by family groups 

This hotel was built for a clientele who are as vanished as the Anglo irish Bank . Its current diminished standards are just , I guess, a reflection of painful economic reality .",3,2011,12,28
217,The very definition of a 5 star experience.,"Exactly what a five star hotel should be! Wonderfully perceptive service from professional staff, large well thought out rooms with all you could need. Heavenly bed, quality linens, massive towels, a powerful shower, free wifi, wonderful views from a sheltered balcony, and all the little touches that you could think of - from bath salts, and mouthwash to a introductory guide to the Irish language. 

We enjoyed a very good value dinner in Gordon Ramsey which have to say I felt was much improved with its new format with attentive service and really good quality food, and a really luxury room service breakfast served on time and again with excellent food. 

The pool and spa where also fantastic, all you could ask for in an overnight escape!

An other point to mention is that I had initally stayed in this hotel within a month off it's opening, and it still feels ""as good as new"" but all the better for having matured into a more polished operation. I very much look forward to my next visit. ",5,2011,12,25
217,Wonderful stay!,"My husband and I enjoyed a one night stay in early September following a week long trip to Ireland for our anniversary.  The hotel was an easy drive with our GPS in a rural area outside of Dublin in the beautiful Wicklow Mountains near Powerscourt Gardens.  Front desk staff was effecient and very helpful.  We had booked a deluxe garden view suite.  The room was incredible...huge separate closet/changing area, large white marble bathroom, and two large rooms..one a separate bedroom....very spacious and elegant.  We were surprised that our garden view was not facing out toward the mountains but was limited to a tree and some scrubs right outside the window but we know to request a mountain view next time.  I was surprised that they didn't give us a mountain view for out special stay given that the hotel was quite empty.  
We enjoyed riding the complimentary bikes along the road to Powerscourt gardens as well as the incredible views at the nearby golf course.  We walked around the grounds of the hotel and enjoyed the most decadent spa we have ever been to....very relaxing and beautiful with a large pool and jacuzzi and plenty of lounge chairs with large towels on them...huge walk in showers.
We had some beers in the pub which was nice but skipped the fancy dining room and ate at a great Italian restaurant in Enniskerry....very cute little square where we sat outside and had coffee.  Couldn't find a local pub downtown for live music which was disappointing but hit the hotel pub instead.
The room was the highlight with the spa second and the location was perfect for us.  Next time we would stay longer and use this as a base to visit more places in the area.  The Powerscourt Gardens you can walk to and worth every Euro of the entrance fee.  Also the Advoca shops inside were great for picking up gifts.  The cafe there had a light breakfast and beat paying $50+ for breakfast at the hotel.  A wonderful stay!",5,2011,12,24
217,Overall view of stay,My wife and I stayed last Saturday(17th Dec 2011) for one night for her 60th birthday. The room on the 6th floor was fantastic with a huge balcony and sun loungers. Pity it was freezing! Not many complaints except it cost €11 for two cups(average size) of coffee! The food in the Gordon Ramsey restaurant was just ok. My wife had hake and  there would have been more fish on a fish finger!! Way over priced for ordinary fair.  There was absolutely no atmosphere in the lounge area that evening. Most people seemed to disappear either to bed or Enniskerry. To pay €254.00 for one nights B/B is a treat. Would not do it again but as I say a nice hotel in a nice location. I wonder will it still be trading in 12 months?,4,2011,12,20
217,Grand Experience !,"We spent 4 nights at this property from 6th-10th december 2011. Though it was for a business conference, we did spend one full day discovering the hotel property.
Its true luxury to be staying here and you feel like royalty once you check in. The hotel and its surrounding gardens, golf course etc are spectacular and provide a breathtaking view. We enjoyed whiling away time at the Powerscourt House Avoca arcade too. We took long walks to Enniskery village from the hotel every evening which was very rejuvenating. Its a beautiful property on the whole and we enjoyed our stay here.We would definitely recommend to all.",5,2011,12,16
217,Putting on The Ritz,"The staff were extremely nice and the room was excellent. A solid nights sleep on a perfect bed also was a great part of our family visit. If you don't feel like spending the money to eat in Gordon Ramsey's restaurant in the hotel, then you can have great food in their lovely Irish pub.
It's probably the best hotel I've stayed in in Ireland.",5,2011,12,12
217,Expensive but worth it.,Beautiful rooms. Superb spa. Fantastic food in Gordan Ramsey's. A weekend of pure luxury but you pay for the experience.,5,2011,12,05
217,Luxurious stay...,"We stayed at this hotel for a Saturday night in a Garden suite...The hotel is really wonderful...very luxurious and relaxing....We used the pool facilities and it was the most fabulous pool I have used in a hotel! The staff were extremely friendly and helpful. There was a wide selection of food for the buffet breakfast and it tasted fantastic! 
One small complaint...as I'm pregnant we just wanted to relax for the night so we brought some dvds with us. I requested a dvd player from reception and was told that it would cost 30-40 euro for the use of it if they had one! I declined! Due to the very high cost of staying in a suite I thought that there would at least be a dvd player in the room or at worst one available from reception free of charge! 
Anyways other than that we had a wonderful stay and if you can afford it as a special treat it's well worth it. We also took a wander around the powerscourt gardens which were beautiful!",4,2011,12,05
217,"Ritz-CArlton Powerscourt, Wicklow, Ireland","My wife and I returned yesterday afternoon from Dublin having spent a couple of days at The Ritz-Carlton, Powerscourt, in Enniskerry, Ireland.  My wife and I arrived early (7:30am+/-) and our room was not yet ready according to Paul at the front desk.  He called maid service to prepare the room then escorted my wife and me to the Gordon Ramsey restaurant for coffee to wait on the room.  We discovered that in addition to Gordon Ramsey two other eateries are on site, Sugar Loaf Lounge and McGill’s Pub.  Our suite had a magnificent view of the Sugar-Loaf Mountain and to say our suite was large would be an understatement.  Everything the “Ritz” is famous for is found at Powerscourt, Enniskerry, Ireland!  As seen from our suite, the hotel grounds appeared expansive and well-manicured even though the foliage was transitioning into winter.  The hotel has lot to offer- horseback riding, spa services, a river-walk and a separate rose garden.  Also, located near-by is an excellent golf course.  In speaking with Damon, their general manager, the hotel has the ability to support multiple weddings as well as business conferences all at the same time.  I expect to return to Dublin and this will be my hotel of choice.  To those of you considering a Dublin area hotel, I do recommend The Ritz-Carlton, Powerscourt of Enniskerry, Ireland for your next stay.",5,2011,12,04

217,Fantastic long weekend,"Myself and girlfriend stayed at the Ritz Carlton hotel for 3 nights to celebrate her Birthday. I booked the 'stay 3 nights pay for 2' deal directly with the hotel and went for the Mountain View Suite which was totally amazing. We ate at the 3 different restaurants within the hotel over the weekend making for 3 different eating experiences and all very enjoyable. The food prices not so expensive considering where you are although the drinks add up and make a big difference to the bill each night and vary in price depending on where they are ordered. Went for the sunday soother spa treatment which was good value and took advantage of the complimentary bike hire to view the surroundings which was very pleasant. Overall thought it was good value and a lovey warm,casual atmosphere throughout. Abit dissapointed with paper cups for tea/coffee within the suite and had to ask for the basics,not sure about the lollypops either!",5,2011,12,01

217,Relaxing time in luxurious surroundings,"My husband and I went there for one night recently and we had a very nice relaxing 24 hours.
We made the most of all that the hotel had to offer as I was using a generous voucher which I got for my birthday.  Check-in was reasonably smooth, although our room wasn't ready when we arrived, so we went down to the spa to check-in for our treatments later in the day. We were advised to go to our room and come down in our bathrobes and enjoy the complimentary lunch at the spa which was part of our package prior to our treatments. We ended up taking a bit longer than we had expected as our luggage was a little slow to come up to the room. The room was a suite style room which over looked the car-park ... my fault as I asked for a garden suite and not a mountain suite ... this hotel has an amazing garden ... which is on the same side as the the mountain view ... so .. if you want a mountain view, state that you want a mountain view or you will have a ""garden view"" ... which also has views of the car park. We were very high up, and the tall trees were amazing as they swayed in the gusting winds, so we actually didn't mind that. Each time we entered the room I felt like someone had been smoking there in the past. We had a lovely balcony, which was ample room for someone to smoke. I was told that all rooms are non-smoking.   The room was really lovely, and had everything .. not to mention a very comfortable bed!
We had a pleasant time at the Spa .. used the pool before we had our treatments. I would suggest though that the music at the reception area at the Spa and around the pool area is not quite ""Spa"" music - I was expecting very relaxing music rather than more ""pop"" type. The treatment rooms have more relaxing music which you'd find in any spa.
We reserved a table at the Gordon Ramsay Restaurant. It was my 4th or 5th time to eat there and the food was as good as every other time. Both my husband and I commented on the renovated ""Cocktail Bar"" which in our opinion was quite out of place in such a beautiful setting ... looked like something you'd see in a very modern night club .. all white .. and bright, and very open ... We had had fond memories of previous visits and enjoying some drinks at the more traditional style bar there. The staff at the restaurant were very pleasant and engaging. We went for a drink at the McGill's bar, and there were quite a few people there, and all seemed to be having a good time.
We had a very pleasant buffet breakfast in the Sugar Loaf Lounge, in beautiful sunshine.
We finished off the visit by a wonderful walk along the river just a few minutes from the hotel. As it's a private walk there weren't many people there. 
I always enjoy visiting this hotel and I look forward to going back - might not be until I get another gift voucher though!! It is definitely a 5 star hotel and it does feel like one!",4,2011,11,28
217,Great weekend - great hotel,"Stayed in the Ritz Carlton in Wicklow for a weekend away with my wife (the first together in a long time and celebrating our anniversary) which I can say was absolutely fabulous. This is a true 5 star hotel worthy to call itself 5 stars unlike many of the zombie hotels left in Ireland. 
Firstly, the setting is fantastic (make sure to ask for a Mountain view ) with one of the most scenic places in Ireland. 
The access to the hotel off the m50 (the main ringroad around Dublin) will ensure that you will get here easily,(I am actually from Dublin and managed to get here in 40 minutes from North County Dublin on a Friday evening despite heavy traffic) so its a great place for a weekend splash and dash if living in Dublin as your there in no time which is great
The accommodation is all good, , we had a ""romantic"" suite which was cool and zanny with a bath in the main living room private terrace, cocktail bar, private steam room and loads of little extras that make up for an enjoyable space to live in for the weekend. 
The Amenities of the hotel are excellent from the leisure centre to the pool to the spa. Also you have beautiful walks around the old gardens of Powerscourt House. Also the hotel rent bikes and make sure you get a pass to get through onto the river walkway - very enjoyable. There is also a great golf course abutting the hotel which I have played on previous visits which has two courses both are excellent and with a great club house. You can walk down to Enniskerry Village which is a pretty little village with a selection of restaurants. 
The food - what can I say - the food is excellent and we eat in the Gordon Ramsay restaurant which was very good with great service and staff. Its not that dear in fact as I was told they changed the menu from Fine Dinning to more Irish Fine Dinning with big steaks, grilled lamb, etc More in the way to suit the irish palate. We got the chefs table which is a great experience and higly recommend it. The waiter was really excellent and service was second to none. It was also busy on a saterday night so book at the weekend. 
Breakfast was also great and we eat in the bar the first night (due to the Irish  V Estonia Match Being On) which was excellent as well.
The thing you notice about this hotel is the amount of staff and how they will do anything for you which is great - you don’t get the barman who you can tell is on his first and last week working ever in a bar. The staff enjoy working there and its obvious. The staff from the check in to the pool area where all excellent, chatty and helpful.
Overall, it was a great weekend and one can sit in the lobby sipping coffee and surfing on the complementary samsung tablets which cab be rented. 
There was no wedding there that weekend and the weather was great which I think added to the delight of the weekend. Its a modern hotel but with a traditional feel to it. Cant really fault it and whilst its a little dearer than most, I think you get value for your ""buck"". The only fault was that the air con would not go off in the room but cest le vie. 
Great weekend and will be back.",5,2011,11,21
217,beautiful hotel,Stayed in hotel with family kids loved it set in lovely location with rustic walks and bikes for guests electric carts available to use to tour the estate excellant swimming pool and spa kids loved play room specially for kids with very friendly staff,5,2011,11,21
217,Gorgeous hotel with fantastic service!,"We booked two rooms - one with points and with a regular payment.  We were upgraded to suites for both rooms...suites with stunning views and perfect accommodations!   
Hotel staff were wonderful and the atmosphere was superb!  

Dining in the first floor restaurant was average at best.  Food was way over-priced and both the service and food quality needed much improvement.  There are many great restaurants in Enniskerry...I'd recommend heading there for dinners.",5,2011,11,21
217,Will be back,"Stayed a few months back. Had a super-time fab rooms, great service beautiful location. The only downfall the food in the Gordon Ramsey restaurant rather salty but loved the setting looking at the Sugar Loaf Mountain. The spa, swimming pool and the leisure facilities are out of this world.",4,2011,11,21
217,Excellent staff,"This was our second visit to the Ritz and it did not disappoint.  It is in a wonderful setting and has walks, golf and shopping right beside it.  There are 3 restaurants, out favourite is the one beside the Reception area, particularly the lunch menu.  Gordon Ramseys restaurant downstairs disappointed, not a lot of crab in the crab starter, scallops tasteless and salty, mashed potato also tasteless and salty, spinach ditto, they do a steak well but who does'nt!  The Ritz is a lovely retreat to relax and chill out, swimming pool and spa also very nice although the jacuzzi could prob do with a change of water.  What makes this hotel is the friendly and helpful staff and the wonderful setting also the very comfortable beds.  I would recommend it!",4,2011,11,21
217,Not worth the money.,"Had heard alot about this Hotel so decided to give it a try.
Just can not get over the prices. I paid €216 for a room overlooking the car park. The room was very nice but not worth the money, big deal if you press a button to open the curtains!!!
Went to go onto internet in the room and they wanted €12.50 per hour.
Went to the hotel bar McGills, €6 for bottle of Corrs and €6.50 for long-neck bottle of Bulmers.
Had a few snacks and they were delicious.
Was not going to stay paying those prices all night so we went down to Enniskerry and really enjoyed it. Live music in the local pub and great atmosphere.
Came back to Hotel about 11 and had a look into the bar, there would have been more life at a funeral!!! so went to bed.
Next morning had a look at the breakfast menu......€29 each for breakfast. Checked out and had a lovely breakfast in Enniskerry €9.90.
Will agree with the other reviews, the staff are all excellent and very helpful. 
Hopefully prices will drop and they will get more people in to create and atmosphere!!!",2,2011,11,21
217,Fab! Fab! Fab!,"Fantastic hotel and the and service was absolutely outstanding from the minute I booked until we left. I booked a Mountain view suite for the weekend of my girlfriends birthday and from the minute I booked I knew we were in for the 5 star treatment. The Restaurant manager emailed to ask for special requirements for our dinner in the Gordon Ramsay restaurant within days of booking online. Even arranged a special piece of cake for after dinner for her without hesitation.
We arrived after a 2 hour drive and as soon as we walked into the lobby the concierge was taking our bags and escorting us to check in with a friendly welcome and smile. We were then escorted to our amazing room with a tour of the bars and restaurants on the way. He then showed us how to operate the touchscreen controls in the room for lighting and heating and showed us round the suite - fantastic service! An envelope in the room with a card welcomed us to the hotel and hoped my partner had a great birthday weekend and to enjoy the complimentary handmade chocolates left for her - service above and beyond again and we had just arrived!
Off to the Spa where we had a treatment each to unwind before dinner in McGills pub. The Spa was luxurious and the treatments were relaxing with yet more special treatment from the every welcoming and smiling staff. 
Dinner was fancy pub food and it was delicious - we had sticky ribs, steak and guinness pie and chilli nachos....all demolished and left overs were kindly boxed up for us to eat in our room for later.....
Our room was beautifully appointed and the oversize king bed was the comfiest bed we had slept in for years...I especially enjoyed shaving in the morning and watching the TV set into the mirror and watching Sky Sports! Great fun.....
Breakfast service was lovely and relaxed and the waiting staff could not have been more accomodating.....the selection of food was fabulous and our waiter Alberto was attentive but not intrusive....the service all weekend was like this and we felt like royalty. The hot food was great and the sausages were a highlight. We also enjoyed the breakfast parfait with granola and fruit...yummy! We sat for a good 1.5 hours and read the papers at the table and soaked up the atmosphere. Alberto even came to offer us hot chocolate or Cafe Latte to finish our breakfast....fantastic way to start our day......
The 3D concierge service in reception was our next stop and she suggested some bikes to go for a ride round the Estate.....we take up the offer and enjoyed some fresh air and the Avoca shop in the old Estate house.....the scenery around the hotel is beautiful and lots of people out walking with the kids and dogs...the concierge also offered complimentary Samsung Tablets for use with the free in-room wifi but we just didnt have time.
Our dinner in Gordon Ramsays restaurant was a highlight of the weekend. The food and service was out of this world and we cleaned our plates on every course!! Our waiter presented my girlfriend with a lovely chocolate torte with Happy Birthday in chocolate icing written on the plate. We also had amazing hand made petit fours after dinner which were delicious and a great end to a fabulous meal.
Our final morning was again a fantastic breakfast but my girlfriend was feeling rather tired after a weekend of so much relaxation and I phoned down to enquire about a late check out. We were immediately offered a 3pm checkout as it was a ""special"" occasion and we were left up new keys for the room within a few mins....again staff couldnt have been more helpful...
On checking out the concierge helped us out to the car and wished us a pleasant journey home and gave us some bottles of water so we didnt need to stop for a drink....
This is the hotel by which all 5 star hotels should be measured! Simple as that...some hotels could do with sending their staff here for a weekend to see how it should be done.....every single member of staff from waiting staff to reception to concierge were welcoming, helpful and friendly....it made our weekend one we wont forget for a long time and we would go back in a heartbeat. It is not a cheap weekend but its worth the money for a splurge or special occasion....couldnt recommend it enough and havent shut up about how good a hotel it is since we got back......cant fault a single thing and anyone that can hos some serious personal issues in my opinion!! Go Go Go you wont regret it!",5,2011,11,18
217,Priceless!,"Fantastic, scenic property with outstanding service.  Warm, welcoming and professional staff.  Loved every minute of our two night stay!  ",5,2011,11,16
217,Close to Perfect!,"Our first experience with the Powerscourt was the response to my 3 email messages sent prior to our arrival.  Each question was answered promptly and completely and offered more information than I requested.  We arrived at the Powerscourt from our international flight very early in the morning.  Although check-in time is 3pm, the front desk staff quickly found 2 available rooms and we were so grateful.  

First disappointment came at The Breakfast Room (which doubles as Gordon Ramsey's restaurant in the evening).  Skip the Eggs Benedict!  It was overpriced, bland and poorly prepared.   Most people seemed to opt for the Breakfast Buffet.  The fact that we chose not to choose the Buffet seemed confusing to the staff.  

The rooms are beautifully appointed with lavish bathrooms and the beds are extremely comfortable.  The rooms were immaculate and housekeeping staff were friendly and helpful,  
The hotel is located in a beautiful area with lush scenery a short walking distance away.  

The Powerscourt Manor and Garden are a short walk from the hotel.  Our first day we toured the Garden, and the views are breathtaking.  The onsite restaurant offers fresh different  choices every day.  There were 3 in our party, we ate their twice and  both times we enjoyed our meals.  Menu choices are reasonably priced.

I couldn't say enough about the staff at the Powerscourt.  They were a pleasure to speak with and they could not do enough to make our stay an enjoyable one.  Most notably was Robbie, Conceirge Manager, Matthew, bellhop/driver, and Alex bellhop/doorman.  A wonderful perk of the Powerscourt is they offer limousine service to Enniskerry village upon request when they staff is not otherwise engaged.  Everyone at the front desk was helpful and enjoyable.

Enniskerry village, just a 5 minute drive from the hotel offers several restaurant choices.  We ate at the Powerscourt Arms twice and enjoyed dinners both nights.  We also ate at Emilia's which was very good as well.

We found McGill's Pub located in the hotel a bit boring.  The bartender, who also seemed to be the manager, wasn't particularly friendly and borderline rude.  On our second visit to the Pub, entertainment was scheduled at 9pm.  The entertainer was late, loud and not very talented.  Many people left when the entertainment started.

Overall the Powerscourt is a magnificent hotel and is located in a beautiful location in Ireland.  We thoroughly enjoyed our trip as it was pretty close to perfect!",4,2011,11,14
217,We got the royal treatment,"Magnificent is the best word I can use to describe this wonderful hotel. Located on 1000 acres of beautiful forest and abutting several thousand more acres of what was once the Powerscourt estate, this beautiful hotel offers a tremendous amount of amenities. The entrance was grand, and although the outside cold air penetrated the space, the beautiful fireplaces compensated.  The guest rooms were luxurious with a grand entry and more closet space than I have in my own bedroom.  A computerized control panel operated the lights, air conditioning and draperies.  The down pillows and comforter added to the comfort of the oversize King bed. Our room overlooked an attractive waterfall with the forest and mountains as a backdrop. The bathroom was huge with marble floors and marble vanity, had a TV built into the mirror, plus a tub and separate shower. There was also a large magnifying mirror which was an unexpected touch.  The room also had an ac/dc power converter stored in the closet that could be used at the desk in the bedroom. Free wifi was available in the room and throughout the hotel (except in the conference center).  There were several restaurants in the hotel, including a pub that served very good food.  There was an onsite spa, fitness center and pool. The grounds also included a lis  just a short 10 minute walk from the main hotel . A garden center, a collection of greenhouses with beautiful flowers, is also available to tour for a small entrance fee. The  town of Enniskerry is about a half mile from the hotel and has several pubs and restaurants. The hotel offers a shuttle via Landrover that can accommodate 6 people. The room, which included a buffet breakfast, was part of a tour package, so I don’t know what the actual room cost was. I would highly recommend this hotel if you want the Royal treatment.",5,2011,11,14
217,5 star quality,"Stayed here for 2 nights.  The room was very large, with a beautiful view of the sugerloaf mountain and the autumn foliage of the trees below.  The food, both in the lounge and the restaurant, was lovely.  The prices are not cheap, but not surprising for a hotel like this.  The only slight low was charging more than 5 euro for a cup of black coffee after dinner in restaurant.

The best thing about the hotel was the staff.  Every single one was helpful and extremely friendly.  So if you want to be looked after well, in lovely surroundings, this is the hotel for you.",5,2011,11,14
217,Ritz Carlton,"I really beautiful, regal Hotel in a quiet Country setting in County Wicklow.
The Hotel has a Gordon Ramsey Restaurant, which in my mind did not live up to expectations.",4,2011,11,11
217,Classic Ritz Carlton,"Stayed at a few Ritz Carltons around the world and this one is up their with the best. Fabulous location, great staff and the rooms really are really superb. Food is good and its no more expensive than any other 5* Hotel and actually a similar price to what you will pay in Central Dublin. Great walks direct from the hotel and overall a superb hotel. Interestingly we recently stayed at the Four Seasons Hampshire and the RItz blew that away for rooms, price and things to do - Four Seasons was just ahead on levels of service.",5,2011,11,10
217,Excellent,"Stayed there after a wedding recently.  Huge, lovely room with a great view, fantastic, hospitable, well-trained staff.  A great experience.",5,2011,11,08
217,Weekend break,Stayed at ritz Carlton powers court for 2 nights. Amazing hotel  lovely spa and pool .Gordon ramseys restaurant was first class had dinner there good food any very pleasant and helpful staff who Showed us around the kitchen chefs tablet was beautiful head chef Peter came out to meet us which was a lovely touch. Looking forward to my next trip.,5,2011,11,07
217,Beautiful View!,"This is a beautiful hotel located in a quaint little city in Ireland.   It is close enough to Dublin to drive into the city and short car ride from the Wicklow Mountains.  The spa is amazing, the moment you step into it you instantly feel relaxed.",5,2011,11,04
217,One of the best,"Stayed here for our 8th wedding anniversary. A nice warm welcome on arrival.Service is excellent unlike many of the so called 4 or 5 star zombie hotels around the country. Gordon Ramsey restaurant is A1.We had dinner there and were taken into the chef's table in the kitchen for dessert!This was a lovely surprise planned by the restaurant staff.George is a great character and is such an asset to the restaurant. Glad to see a new revamped, more down to earth menu. Quality of steak was outstanding- a rarity, sadly in the Early Bird wilderness of today. We had a mountain view room/suite-great details and beautiful furnishings in the room and MOST importantly for my husband-Free and fast Wifi.
Powerscourt waterfall is a short drive and the perfect backdrop for a romantic gesture like presenting a sapphire ring for an anniversary!!!! 
We always have breakfast in our room.Here it is delivered on a little table with an oven underneath to ensure everything stays hot.Absolutely perfect.We have noticed that regardless of what standard of hotel you stay in, 80% of Irish people will come for breakfast after 09.30 thus ensuring a queue and a waiting time and the possibilty of a poorer selection of foodstuffs for breakfast.  The whole place is very well run.Attention to detail here is excellent.",5,2011,11,03
217,THE GRAND FINALE!!!,"This is our last night in Ireland & we are certainly going out with a bang!!  We arrived today here at the Ritz Carlton-Powerscourt & were totally blown away with the beauty of this place!!  Our room, #118, is extremely spacious & has every amenity imaginable! We feel like royalty!!  I can't wait to tell all of our friends about this wonderful place!  I thought Adare Manor was over the top but the Ritz even has that fabulous hotel beat!  Spent some time in their gym this afternoon - very nice! Tonight we went to Johnny Fox's for dinner & music.  What a perfect ending to a wonderful trip!",5,2011,11,03
217,Wonderful Wedding - Dream,We got married September 2011 in the Ritz- Carlton in Powerscourt. It was a fabulous day and we stayed for 4 nights in the hotel. From the minute we arrived to our departure the customer service and attention to detail from all the Ritz team was simply perfect. The hotel team are simply superb at customer service. And all our guests enjoyed themselves. The rooms are wonderful. But I cannot praise enough the whole hotel team. Our wedding coordinator Sandra Spiewig particularly was excellent. She ensured the planning and execution of every tiny detail was perfect for the day. It was a dream dealing with her in the run up to the wedding and we were simply thrilled with how our wedding day turned out. She really ensured everything was smooth and hassle free.,5,2011,11,02
217,A fabulous and relaxing getaway!,My husband and I stayed at the Ritz for six nights and LOVED every minute of it.  We were celebrating my birthday and taking our first trip with just the two of us in a very long time.  We would go back in a heartbeat if we were planning a trip to that area again.  We arrived at 7a on a Monday morning after a six hour flight from JFK and they were able to check us in! Our suite was beautifully appointed and we felt spoiled every time we walked back in to it.  We enjoyed all of the luxurious amenities and touches.  Every staff member we came in to contact with was friendly and welcoming.  The Powerscourt Estate is the perfect setting for a Ritz Carlton and is just the right distance out of Dublin to feel removed but not too far away to experience the city.  The Concierge staff gave us some great recommendations for sight seeing and dining.  The small village of Enniskerry that is a quick walk or drive is full of friendly people and excellent restaurant options.  We ate at Emilia's twice because it had some of the most delicious Italian food we have eaten.  We were very sad to leave the Ritz Carlton Powerscourt and will never forget the time we spent there.  This property met and exceeded our expectations and is a wonderful example of the service and attention that Ritz Carlton is known for.  We hope to return in the future.,5,2011,10,31
217,The perfect recipe !,"Mix together a magnificent setting, amazing friendly staff. Add a touch of Irish hospitality. Stir in superb service and a pinch of culinary excellence........and you have the perfect recipe for THE PERFECT hotel !

Well done Ritz Carlton Powerscourt- you are number one !",5,2011,10,29
217,A luxurious escape in the Garden of Ireland!,"We stayed at the Ritz-Carlton Powerscourt for 3 nights as a part of their 3-for-2 offer and every minute of our visit was perfect!  The rooms are so spacious and beautifully appointed.  I love that there is a separate walk-in area for luggage that keeps your bags out of the way.  Having the lights, curtains, and privacy indicator at your fingertips on the bedside control panel is so convenient as well.  

We took advantage of the private spa suite with energizing hot stone ritual and it was by far the best spa experience I have ever had.  We didn't want to leave!  The Gordon Ramsey restaurant offers an outstanding dining experience (although I was disappointed to have a toddler singing the alphabet song at the next table when were dining after 9 pm).  We also enjoyed the views and cocktails from the Sugar Loaf Lounge, which is decorated with stunning floral displays.  I highly recommend escaping to this beautiful Wicklow oasis!",5,2011,10,27
217,A Dream Hotel,"If only I had the words to describe this hotel! My husband and I visited Ireland in 2009 and have been many places since, however, we still say the Ritz @ Powerscourt was the most fabulous hotel we've ever seen. The rooms are large and lavish with bathrooms that you could spend your entire trip relaxing in. From heated floors to televisions on the wall, you can start and end your day in total relaxation. The drive from Powerscourt is not too far from Dublin, maybe 45 minutes. The outdoor gardens are beautiful in the morning when the fog rolls in. And the spa, WOW! Total tranquility. If you are lokoing for somewhere to rest and relax, and be totally pampered, you should not miss a stay here!",5,2011,10,21
217,Escape to the country in luxury!,"Magnificant hotel! Rooms were spacious, bathroom to die for! Set in amongst the garden of heaven that is Powerscourt we arrived at 12. A special treat for us a night away from the kids with our close friends. We strolled into the nearby picturesque village of Enniskerry for the obligatory ""pint"". Lunch was eaten at a local cafe reasonable rates delicious food. Back at the hotel we booked our meal at the Gorden Ramsey restaurant. The view from our table was breathtaking unfortunately the food was although delicious, a bit of a let down! Nothing really to write home about have eaten nicer in less expensive hotels. After dinner there was only one bar in the hotel an Irish bar and it was dead no atmosphere. It is definately ( in my opinion) not a hotel where you can go let your hair down for a night. Would I go again?? No.  Maybe you have to partake in the ""treatments"" to get the most of your experience or maybe if you want a quiet break with a few books and no interruptions this could be the place for you.",5,2011,10,18
217,"If there were a ""6 Star"" rating, this hotel has already earned it!","Just returned from a 2 night stay at the Ritz-Carlton, Powerscourt and our experience was faultless!  The hotel is in a glorious setting and no expense was spared in the design and architecture of this magnificent hotel.  The staff rises above even their own Ritz-Carlton philosophy of ""Ladies and Gentlemen serving Ladies and Gentlemen"".  Each individual here let their own welcoming character shine through and everyone seemed to love their job.

We were upgraded to a fantastic mountain view Jr. Suite with oak entry, large sitting area, desk, king bed, 19 foot balcony and, yes, a gorgeous bathroom with outstanding amenities abundantly provided.  The electronic room control system in the drawer of each end table kept my husband enthralled as the touch screen opened and closed the sumptuous window drapery and turned area lighting off and on.

The bed was sheer heaven with linens to match.  We floated to our slumber with smiles on our faces. The towels were of equal quality and plentiful.  We were very proud of ourselves for choosing this hotel, but should have set aside more time here.

Even if you have no desire to see or tour Ireland, your next European visit should include a stopover at this hotel just to experience that NEXT level of luxury and service.  My husband had a previous experience at the Waldorf in Rome overlooking Vatican City which he felt could not be surpassed until now.  The Ritz-Carlton, Powerscourt, for us, has trumped every other lodging experience we've had.  There is not a detail overlooked here and the smiles of the staff members make you feel as though you are truly, their special guests!

If you enjoy splurging now and then and have breathtaking memories you treasure, do yourself a favor and add this gorgeous place to your fondest memories.  You won't regret it!",5,2011,10,16
217,Just Perfect,"This hotel is everything you expect and more from a five star hotel. I have stayed here on a few occasions once for work and other times with my husband and with friends as a treat and have only good things to say. The Espa is relaxing and beautiful - I have had the day spa package including lunch and the treatments were very relaxing and staff always very professional.The location is amazing, the staff and service are top notch (obviously have been trained very well) and the food is really tasty. To sum up if you like 5 star service and surroundings stay at this hotel. I cannot wait to return for my next visit.",5,2011,10,13
217,"Wow location, room and pool","Firstly the location is wow - with views of sugarloaf mountain, minutes from Wicklow Hills, Dublin easily accessible and the stunning Powerscourt - it is fantastic.

The room (mountain view suite) was stunning and exceeded all expectations. Plush, huge, a TV in the bathroom etc. 

The pool was another triumph. Quiet and luxurious.

Expensive but oh so worth it!",5,2011,10,11
217,Absolutely superb,"We stayed here for 2 nights and it it the most impressive and stunning hotel we have ever stayed in.

The hotel is set in the magnificent Powerscourt estate and the hotel feels like a country mansion.  We were greeted by staff nervously eager to please and guided to and our around our room, with various points of interest relayed to us.

Whilst the weather was not the best, the views were beautiful and the room was pure luxury.  A magnificent suite with temparture, light, curtains and service a mere touch of a button away.  We were a little perplexed not to find a kettle in the room, but 1 phone call later a very gracious gentleman rang the doorbell and presented us with a freshly boiled kettle and a selection of teas and coffees.  Unbelievable.

Complmentary bicycles were available to wander round the estate and the food and drinks available were lovely.  Our fray into the local village one night was assisted immensely by a chauffeured Land Rover to the village.  We expected to get a taxi back staying out late, but the local pub landlord rang the hotel and within minutes the Land Rover was there.  nothing was too much.

This is the nicest hotel I have ever stayed in and coupled with excellent service it was a true joy that I will remeber for many years.",5,2011,10,10
217,Too nice for words,"Absolutely perfect. Amazing views everywhere you go. Food is great. Would stay here again.
",5,2011,10,09
217,Excellent Hotel,"My wife and I stayed for one night as part of a package tour in eraly September. We expected a lot, and weren't disappointed. We ahd a beautiful suite with a garden view. Extremely large room, well appointed, great bathroom, nice large deep tub (TV in the mirror in the bathroom!), great longing area and soft comfortable beds. Service was excellent, check-in quick and easy and the grounds are aabsolutely stunning, with a gorgeous view of local mountains. In other words everything you would expect from a Ritz-Carlton.
The only donwside for us surprisingly was we ordered room service (assumed it came from the Gordon Ramsay kitchen) and were very disappointed with the food.
Outside of this, which I would hope is an exception, this hotel definitely deserves a 5 star rating.",5,2011,10,08
217,"Space, air, light and a wonderful get-away","My husband and I were at the Ritz-Carlton Powerscourt in September for 2 nights. We were blessed with a lovely Irish September weather. Check-in was friendly, smooth and efficient. We got a suite with a comfortable king-sized bed, a clean and impressive bathroom and a walk in closet. Our room was really elegant and tastefully done. I could just live there :). The high speed free internet in the room was really helpful. Breakfast was of a big selection and of good quality. We also dined at the Gordon Ramsay's restaurant which is buzzing with both in-house guests and locals alike. Service, food and ambience are excellent at the Ritz-Carlton Powerscourt. We also took a tour of the nearby Powerscourt garden, a must visit for anyone visiting Ireland if you have some spare time. 
The only flaw of the hotel is that it is located in a secluded area, which could be very nice if you want a quiet get-away.... but if you want to combine it with a tour of Ireland within a shorter span of time, it is slightly inconvenient. Having said that, I enjoyed every bit of it and would love to return again.",5,2011,10,04
217,5 Stars are not enough!,"My fiance and I stayed at the Ritz-Carlton, Powerscourt for 2 nights in September of 2011.  Our room was very large, with a terrace overlooking the Wicklow Mountains - the view was stunning.  The room was immaculate and beautifully decorated.  The bathroom is large, with heated floors and a wondeful rain shower.

The ESPA was wonderful as well.  I got an aromatherapy massage, which was one of the best massages I have ever had (ask for Kim).  The Serenity Room - amazing!  This is a quiet room, with lounge chairs, pillows, and blankets and an unbelievable view of the mountains.

We had breakfast at the hotel (which was included in the rate), lunch at the spa, as well as dinner in the Sugar Loaf Lounge.  All of the food was delicious.

The entire staff at this hotel is unbelievably friendly, courteous, and helpful.   This is the best hotel that I have ever stayed at.  If I ever win the lottery, I will be taking up permanent residence at the Ritz-Carlton Enniskerry!",5,2011,09,30
217,Perfection and Elegance The Irish Way,"This hotel is the perfect place to stay near Dublin. It is a splurge, but the hotel itself is the definition of elegance, The staff are lovely, the food was magnificent (Gordan Ramsey's kitchen) and you could not pick more beautiful surroundings.  I may run out of supurlatives for this hotel. There is a magnificent spa, a great pub with live music, gardens of various styles including a labyrrinth.  It is located next door to historical Powerscourt and its gardens and just a short walkd from a village that looks like a postcard.  Stay here if you can, you will be very happy you did.",5,2011,09,23
217,What a place!!!,"Origionally we were planning to stay 7 days in the Shelbourne Marriott hotel in Dublin, but that hotel was very disappointing. So after one night, we moved to the Ritz-Carlton Powerscourt. The place is amazing. Spacious rooms. Very well equipped with everything one needs. The staff thoughout the hotel were helpful, hospitable and kind. The food was excellent and the two excellent golf courses are just across the street. The hotel staff will be very happy to drive you there, if you did not want to walk the 200 yard distance. The pro-shop has everything you need, including new Taylor Made clubs. 

The property, which is only 20 minutes by car from Dublin city center and the airport, is surrounded by many charming villages with great Pubs and restaurants as well as many walking/running paths throughtout the surrounding woodlands.

The Spa and its staff and services was outstanding. There is a large size pool and a turkish bath. The fitness center has great views, spaciuos and is very well equiped.",5,2011,09,23
217,Stunning attention to detail,I enjoyed a 3 day breakaway with my wife recently. The property is immaculate and what you would expect from a 5 star hotel. The staff are very attentive and friendly. Nothing is too much trouble and you simply MUST eat in the Gordon Ramsey restaurant. All in all 10/10!,5,2011,09,22
217,5 Star All The Way!,"Our stay at the Powerscourt far exceeded our greatest expectations.  The service was extremely attentive and professional.  The grounds are magnificent, the lobby rich, yet warm.  The Gordon Ramsey restaurant had fabulous food.  Our room was huge with a breathtaking view of Sugarloaf Mountain.  Make sure you visit the Powerscourt Gardens which is located behind a palatial estate up the road a few hundred yards.  It will amaze you. It was an unforgettable experience!",5,2011,09,19
217,Wonderful Stay at a beautiful location,"We thoroughly enjoyed staying at this Ritz location twice for a total of 6 nights.  Everything from the food to the rooms to the location were amazing.  We have stayed at many other Ritz locations and this one goes down in the ""winner"" category.  Some tips are the following: it was our 10th anniversary and I got flowers from the concierge for my wife - they were out of this world beautiful and she couldn't stop talking about them.  I did the fly fishing and given it was a catch and release setup - it was a lot of fun.  Given the views at the hotel, we did room service multiple times and they did not disappoint.  Gordon Ramsey restaurant was very enjoyable and the waiter brought us in the kitchen which was very interesting and added to the wonderful experience.  The spa treatment was nice - Balinese couples massage - not life altering but good enough.  The pool was pleasant but the hot tube was not warm’ish.  The steam room with the cold bucket of water was invigorating.  In the end - Kudos to Ritz.",5,2011,09,16
217,"Beautiful hotel and spa, amateur service","We stayed at this hotel in September. The spa is stunning, and the rooms are beautiful. We had booked two rooms side by side (severla months prior), but staff had evidently decided on the day i querstion to change the booking tyo suit another guest, so we were place on opposite sides of the hotel 3 floors apart. The room wasn't ready to check into at 3.50pm. The restaurant staff were particularly inept, with various things arriving late, one person's meal arriving when other were finished etc, waiter unsure if mustard would be possible (!), waiter spilling ice-cream on me, and a lot of the food very salty, waitress seen circling the room several times with our coffees (tried to catch her attention!) before taking them back to the kitchen. Staff made attempts to make amends, but overall poor experience.",4,2011,09,16
217,Second visit,"Stayed here two years ago and returned because we loved it so much.  I really wanted to use the pool and hot tub which proved to be fabulous.  The room again was great (and not all rooms are suites, by the way) and furnished in the usual Ritz Carlton decor.  But this time I would have to mark them down for breakfast buffet in the Gordon Ramsey restaurant.  While the food is very good, the service is not.  There was one person ensuring the buffet was stocked and kept up.  There were two people dressed in street clothes who seemed to stay at the register the entire time looking at the computer screen.  We could not get anyone's attention for more coffee, which they served to you, nor was anyone available to clear the table.  We had two meals there and the experience was the same.  I thought Gordon Ramsey's restaurants prided themselves on quality and service.  While our room was fine, the television set in my sister's bathroom would not turn off.  She asked for maintenance twice and although they said it was fixed, it was not.  Therefore, her television stayed on the entire time with luckily, low volume.  I would stay there again, but I might opt out of the breakfast, especially since they now have car service to the town of Enniskerry.  Also, the Powerscourt estate has a cafe and is within walking distance.",5,2011,09,15
217,Perfect in every way!,This is a magnificent hotel.  The mountain view was amazing and the service was impeccable.,5,2011,09,15
217,Luxury Christmas Getaway,"Spent a 4 nights here during Christmas.  The hotel and surrounding grounds are gorgeous.  Our room was a suite which was just fantastic.  I think I'm right in saying all rooms are suites which is a real treat.  

Me and my boyfriend booked in for massages which were lovely but it was really disappointing that the thermal suites were separated into male and female. 

All in all, I'd highly recommend the Ritz-Carlton",5,2011,09,13
217,Just superb... Best experience ever!,"This is by far the best hotel I've ever experienced. The suite we had was amazing, it was so roomy and properly separated into living room area and bedroom area with a tv in each room. The bathroom was huge and separate shower area which was bigger than I've ever seen, plus a tv in the bathroom so I could have a soak whilst watching the tennis!. The hotel was immaculate everyday and the views of the sugar loaf mountains from our private balcony were amazing. One thing I don't normally note is staff and it's usually pretty standard across the industry, however, this is not the case at this hotel. The staff are exceptional, they are polite at all times and nothing is ever too much. We had to check out at 6am on our last day, breakfast isn't served until 7:30, but I spoke with the hotel staff (Patrick you were great, thanks!)  they prepared me and my wife a pack up to take away with us on our journey filled with fresh hot pastries, fruit, juice, yogurts and as we handed our room key in they bought up a hot tea pot to serve us a hot drink to take away with us as well. There's so much more to say about this hotel and the experience we had, but none of it would contain a negative, I've never experienced such a fantastic stay away and although initially it seems expensive, the value is really worth it. I will certainly be back!... Oh, and one final thing... The espa spa, swimming pool and gym facilities (gym and pool are free for guests)... Sublime experience!.",5,2011,09,13
217,Another Fantastic Trip!,"This was our fourth trip to the Ritz and again it did not fail to disappoint! 

I booked a Mountain View suite and when I was booking I had advised that we stayed on the 6th floor before and loved it, when we arrived they welcomed us back and said that they had prepared the same suite again for our stay and we were delighted! When we got to the suite they had left us scones with cream and jam and a welcome back card! To see such personal touches from such a large hotel with so many guest rooms is refreshing. 

We enjoyed some great music in Magills pub in the hotel on the Friday night which has added a great atmosphere to a pub which in past visits (before the introduction of the live music) could be quite quiet.. 

The highlight though was our meal in Gordon Ramsays on our second night which was delicious from beginning to end and was also packed which added a great atmosphere. The cocktails were also top notch but if wine is your drink there is more then enough to choose from!

We also enjoyed breakfast in bed which was delicious, perfectly cooked and delivered exactly on time! 

Overall another brilliant experience and for us not too far from home, but you might as well be a thousand miles away!",5,2011,09,12
217,Loved the rooms with views,"Stayed using Marriot points and was wowed by the rooms.  Extremely large room and bathrooms with unique modern features.  Electronic curtains, mood lighting, tv in mirror in bathroom were highlights.  Indoor pool was beautiful, large exercise room with extensive multiple machines.  Only disappointment was the pub which had only one person working the whole bar and seating area which was filled with many people from the conference going on.   Highly recommend staying here though and would have liked to stay a night or two more.",4,2011,09,06
217,If only all hotels were like the Ritz,"We stayed at the Ritz in Nov 2010 for 3 nights. We booked 2 suites on the stay for 3, pay for 2 night’s offer (€620 per suite) which is good value for what you get. I wanted to go back this summer but the rates were a lot higher so I think we’ll be waiting until winter to return. Getting to the hotel is very easy. A short trip from Dublin and yet you feel a million miles away when you arrive. It is nested in the beautiful countryside of Co Wicklow, is purpose built and fittingly deserving of its five stars. 
The suites are beautiful. Each one has a kitchen, a living room, bedroom, 2 separate bathrooms and are a generous 731 square feet. We booked a Mountain View suite which you pay a little more for and to be honest we couldn’t really see the mountain however it was the better site to be on and there were lovely views of the gardens and forest. With 3 flat screen TV’s in the suite and there was no shortage of things to watch. The pay per view selection was great and finally a five star hotel that advertises having a mini bar and actually does have a stocked mini bar. We really enjoyed our time in the room and given that we had a baby with us the whole set up was perfect. The rooms feature electronic finger tip panels for controlling lighting, curtains and air-conditioning. It was all just fabulous. The only thing that I didn’t like was the bed. I’m pretty sure that its two beds joined together (which I hate) and although it’s hugh it was sloping and not really that comfortable. We may have just been unlucky as my mums bed seemed to be ok. We did call and ask them to look at it but it didn’t really change the situation. 
The hotel was not at full capacity while we were there and just a little quiet.  We dined in the foyer area and in the bar. We didn’t go to Gordon Ramsey’s restaurant and that was because we had the baby. They said it would be fine to take him but if I’m going to spend that kind on money on food I want to give the meal my full attention and would also rather if there was a little more hustle and bustle about the place. I don’t think having Gordon Ramsey’s name over the door really adds anything. For me, I would rather see some local talent in the kitchen, someone who would actually be there daily overseeing the food and mingling with the guests. Breakfast was served in Gorden Ramsey Restaurant every morning and it was lovely. The quality of the food was excellent and the staff were great. They brought us in and showed us the kitchens which are very impressive. You can dine at the ‘chefs table’ which is located in the kitchen so it was great to see this. I’d say dining here with friends would be a real buzz and I will definitely do it at some stage. 
We booked a day spa package which was lovely. The spa area is fantastic and I would highly recommend using it if you stay in the hotel. The only thing that annoyed me was that my husband’s treatments lasted longer than mine when we both walked through the door at the same time and were booked in for the same thing. The hotel offers some really reasonable day spa packages which include lunch and unlimited use of the thermal suite. 
I would definitely recommend this hotel to anyone looking to get away from it all for a few days. I think it would also be a great base to explore Dublin and Wicklow. I will definitely go back to this hotel soon.",5,2011,09,04
217,One of the nicest hotels we have ever stayed at!,"We were blessed to stay @ The Ritz for a 5 day business trip and I didn't want to leave!!!
We came in early and drove the country side and stayed at some B&B's and other hotels and let me tell ya, after sleeping on mattresses as hard as rocks, our bed at the Ritz was like sleeping on clouds!!!!  I slept so good those 5 nights!  We had breakfast every morning at The Gordan Ramsay Restaurant downstairs.  The food and the service was amazing!  McGills Pub was a lot of fun and for one of the business dinners, we had a horse and carriage ride to The Powerscourt House.  The grounds and garden are absolutely beautiful with Sugarloaf in the background.  There really isn't much else around the property, so it was perfect for the business portion of the trip.  The staff was very courteous and helpful.  Our room was beautiful as well.",5,2011,09,01
217,What a beautiful hotel,"Stayed at many ritz carltons in the usa and this is a match for the best
Suite was the best ever , service excellent, food quality to match
Only downside is they have no club lounge as there was not the demand- cannot understand why 
Will go back and highly recommended",5,2011,08,26
217,Not what i expected from a 5 * ho,"Stayed here 5 nights from 14 Aug 2011, in a garden view suite. The room was fantastic with lots of space, light and airy. However there were several things that I found disappointing; the room had very little view other than the car park, the toiletries in the bathroom were sparse - only 1 each of soap, shampoo and shower gel for 2 people and the cups for the hospitality tray were paper - we ended up buying china ones!!   
The food was superb especially in the Garden Ramsay restaurant and a wide selection at breakfast. All of the staff were very friendly and nothing was too much trouble for them, however, the service at breakfast was poor on 2 days we were not offered drinks and had to ask for them and clearance of plates was very slow.
Overall I would stay again but would opt for mountain view suite and take my own cups!!",3,2011,08,21
217,"Poor service, disappointed as wasn't the 5 star I was expecting",Asked for water and scissors to be brought to the room neither arrived. No pamper products in the room and ruff toilet paper. Meal in Gordon ramseys was extremely salty and not edible. Spa was full of children. We got locked out of our room and told to queue at reception for 20 minutes in my robe and slippers and wet hair..totally ridiculous! ,3,2011,08,21
217,Lovely hotel and very luxurious but perhaps just a bit too big?,The beatiful setting is what makes this hotel and all the bedrooms avail of the stunning view - we stayed in a very large suite with lovely balcony and the room was truly beautiful and very luxurious.  The restaurant was lovely and the spa was good.  Only negative is that it's just a bit too big and inevitably loses the personal touch as a result.,4,2011,08,12
217,Nearly Perfect,"Stayed 5 days, so we had a good, lomg look at this property. Hard to fault anything. Mountain View suite booked via AmEx Fine Hotels and Resorts. Stayed 5 nights for the price of three WITH full breakfast daily.

Staff is top-notch and hits that fine line between being attentive and overbearing. Nothing was too much trouble for them and they are as good as any staff I have ever seen.

Room was beautiful and had a stellar view of the the Wicklow Mountains. Bed was superbly comfortable. Teriffic bathroom very nicely appointed but tub is surprisingly narrow.  Lots of tech bells and whistles that WORKED instead of being confusing or distracting.  A very nice balcony allowed for al fresco cocktails in the evening. Even in August we were able to sleep with the balcony doors open and hear the fountains gurgle away. Not all floor have balconies, fyi.

Dining options are very nice. Separate reviews are on the way for McGills Pub and Gordon Ramsay Chef's table. Both were teriffic.

Decor was understated but elegant. Lounges and lobby have a relaxing and refined resort vibe. Bikes, croquet, and lawn chess are all easily arranged with the staff. The ladies loved their massage treatments at the ESPA spa..

The place is a bit isolated from the rest of Ireland, which has plusses and minuses of course. There is no ATM on the property, nor in the nearby village of Enniskerry, so plan ahead. About a 20 minute walk into Enniskerry, which is a nice little village though lacking in major attractions. Previous reviews mention a pub called Nancy's, but it is now called the Old Forge. Nice spot for a pint or a meal, or to play some billiards with the friendly locals. Be advised the way back is a fairly steep uphill walk.

If you are looking for a chance to relax in luxury in a beautiful setting with an attentive staff trying their very hardest, look no further. Just be aware that leaving the property takes a little planning, though taxis are fairly available.

And free hi speed internet is available everywhere in the hotel!",5,2011,08,05
217,5 Stars....count'em 5 stars,The Ritz-Carlton Powerscourt deserved each of its 5 stars. We stayed in a beautiful suite that was all about luxury - from the rainforest shower to the TV in the bathroom mirror - nothing was missed. The pub restaurant food was great although the pub was a bit too loud the night of our stay - of course a wedding reception added to the noise. We'd love to do it all again - almost forgot the breakfast buffet - the absolute best meal of our week long Irish vacation. You won't be disappointed with the Ritz-Carlton Powerscourt.,5,2011,08,04
217,Hhmmmm,"Partner booked this as a suprise break for three nights between xmas & new year. Was so excited when I realised where we were staying. The hotel is fabulous, furniture and fittings gorgeous, he had booked a mountain view suite and it was beautiful. A big living area, huge bedroom, seperate dressing area and big bathroom. There was also a seperate toilet in the entrance to the living room and a balcont outside.
I am a late night and early morning tea drinker and asked if it would be possible to get a tea coffee tray, which was supplied immediately.

the downfall however was the service. There was no turn down, no newspaper delivered to the room, and the staff while all very pleasant were not forthcoming and often had to be called to obtain service.

We dined in the bar on the first night which was very nice and in the lounge for the remaining two nights. We had wanted to eat in Gordon Ramsey but there was a wedding in it on one night and the other night was booked. We were not prompted at check in about making a dinner reservation and by the following afternoon when we remembered we had not booked, there was no availability for that night or following night.

I had a treatment in the Spa which was very good, very relaxing and is a beautiful setting.

Overall our stay was very nice, on arrival we were wowed but as the days went on we felt that it was not up to a 5* star standard. Would not rule out a return in the future though, it is a very beautiful hotel.",4,2011,08,04
217,An amazing hotel!,We had a fabulous stay at the Ritz-Carlton Powerscourt.  We were traveling with our two daughters and we all enjoyed the hotel equally.  The hotel boasts gorgeous views and the rooms are incredibly spacious and well-appointed.  The spa is unmatched.  We enjoyed a lovely dinner at Gordon Ramsay's restaurant and more casual dinners at the other hotel restaurant on other nights.  We have never enjoyed a hotel more.,5,2011,08,04
217,Anniversary bliss,"Got married in the ritz last year band they kindly invited us back for our anniversary for a complimentary bed and breakfast and dinner in Gordon ramsays restaurant. We booked to stay the night before also so as to make it a lengthy weekend. Had an amazing time and finally got to experience the ritz in all its glory....something we couldnt manage with the excitement and busyness on the same date last year! Greeted with a happy anniversary and welcome back card which was accompanied by chocolates and pastries. 
Really enjoyed the spa and indoor pool, so relaxing...didn't have any treatments and didn't feel the need...
Nice room right in the centre of the hotel with an even more impressive bathroom.....watched many a programme on the tv within the mirror whilst in the bath. Can only dream of one day having such an amazing bathroom in my home. I don't get excited about bathrooms generally but I could have stayed here all day. 
Had lunch in the sugar loaf lounge which was amazing, best gourmet lunch we've ever had, used the complimentary bikes to go to powerscourt house, availed of the complimentary chauffeur to take us to and from enniskerry where we went for dinner on the 1st night to the local Chinese which was very good... 
Although they only invite your back on the 1st anniversary, myself and mŷ husband have decided it will have to be an annual anniversary treat from now on since we loved it so much!
Can highly recommend the ritz",5,2011,08,04
217,5 Star Vacation but signs of slipping to 4 star,"This Hotel is classed as a 5 star Hotel so I expected alot from my stay.  Also this was our wedding anniversary which I mentioned in my comments on booking.

On driving into the grounds, the hotel is stunning.  Doormen great you warmly and take your bags on arrival.  The reception Area is just stunning.  You are guided to the reception Area to the welcoming staff on Duty.  Your bellhop then brings you to your room and gives a run down of all amenties and where you go for dinner, etc.  So first appearances plus customer service - 5 stars.

Our Room looked out upon the Fountain plus Wicklow mountains.  The room is huge with a walk in area for the closet.  The bathroom is also very big with a rain shower which I love.  Again 5 stars for the Room.

On our first night we decided to eat in the Irish bar as we were not hungry enough for a 5 course meal.  I ordered Ribs and the chicken dish for the maincourse.  My wife ordered a Burger.  My Ribs were discustion, full of fat.  My Chicken dish was laughable - you wont believe me but it was a snack box meal but not even a nice one.  It was just deep fried wings of chicken with chips under it (Not even a chicken breast), dripping in fat from the chicken been placed ontop of it.  I complained to the waitress/bar women but she just laughed at me and walked off.  This dish cost me 20 euro.  I'd rather eat a snack box meal in Supermacs than eat here again.  Stay clear of the Irish bar in this Hotel, overpriced horrible food.  I included this in my comment card and handed it into reception on departure but no apology has been forthcoming from the Hotel.  This is where I think the 5 stars is slipping.  So dinner in irish bar - 0 stars.

On the second day my wife went to the spa and I went to the gym.  I am told the Spa is beautiful.  Pity I cannot say the same for the gym.  A huge let down for a gym in a 5 star hotel.  Old equipment.  Speakers at the back of the room for the music.  I would expect surround-sound music, top class equipment, i.e. Power Vibrator Plate.  A big let down.

We decided to go into town that night for dinner and drinks as the Hotel is very quite at night-time.  We ate at a lovely Italian restaurant in Town.  The food was beautiful and alot cheaper than the disaster food the night before.  The pub next door had a band playing and the locals are very friendly.

Breakfast is the Hotel is very nice.  Buffet food with eggs made to order.

On walking around the hotel on our last day at 12:30.  The fountain Area was full of glasses from the wedding the night before so again this is where the 5 stars is slipping.  No one monitors the outside of Hotel.

I cannot comment on the golf course as I didnt get time to play a round of golf but It looked like a really nice course.

So my stay was a tale of two halves.  The first half a horrible dinner in the irish restaurant which wasn't fit for my dog.
The second half, a lovely spa day with dinner in the town which was gorgeous.

Based on all of this I would rate this Hotel 4 stars.  you need to be perfect to get 5 stars and this stay was far from perfect.  Also there was no mention of congrats on your wedding anniversary throughout my stay.",4,2011,08,02
217,Still Disappointed!,"This is the second time that we stayed at the hotel after a poor experience two years ago but looked at the positive tripadvisor reviews and thought that we would try it again. Unfortunately it still proved disappointing.

The hotel is stunning and the room was great but again we felt let down by the level of service, specifically after our experience in the Gordon Ramsay restaurant. When we booked I explained that we had a poor experience at the restaurant during our last stay but was assured that there were many changes, a new menu, more relaxed atmosphere etc.. but as it turned out, unfortunately no changes for the better.

Our waiter went to great lengths to explain that the duck was cooked medium rare as per the chefs recommendation but when we received our meal it was over cooked and tough!  We also struggled to cut our loaf of bread with a 'butter knife' which was served with our cheeses!

It was also frustrating to constantly have to get the staffs attention to get our wine which was good quality but over priced. The wine menu is expensive and not that accessible unless you are very familiar with your Burgundys and Bordeauxs. You would consequently also hope for some assistance with the wine menu but none was offered which is not what you would expect when the average price is well over 100 Euros for a bottle. 

In anycase, we decided not to make a fuss and to enjoy our night and I would not be writing this review but for the fact that the manager stopped us when we were leaving the restaurant to ask whether we had paid our bill! At the least, I would expect a 'Thank You, Come again' which is fairly standard even in McDonalds but this added insult to injury, especially as we had left a more than reasonable tip!

I complained at reception and they removed the tip and said that they would take note of my complaint which they obviously did not as when we checked out this morning we were asked how as our experience at the Ramsay restaurant! It was also worth noting that I was not a lone voice as the consensus amongst other diners who we met in the bar later was similar to ours and definitely does not live up to expectations.

On the positive side, all of the staff that we met at reception were very friendly and courteous and they also helped change our room so that we got a balcony. All in all, not worth the experience as it has all the trappings of a 5 star resort, especially the costs, but unfortunately not the service nor the attention to the customer.",2,2011,07,31
217,"Dream hotel, beautiful and peaceful","From the moment we arrived my mother and I knew we chose the perfect place.  Beautiful and serene with a classy, low-key elegance and an incredibly kind and helpful staff. Our week at the Ritz was as close as you can get to the perfect holiday.  We stayed in the Mountain Suite-an elegant and comfortable space with a large all marble bath, large dressing room, living room area and separate bedroom.  Our balcony outside was huge with breathtaking views. The concierge staff-Robbie and Kieran-never tired of us asking for thier opinion on where to visit in the area or where to eat, and printed off several directions to historic sites as we braved driving ourselves and rented a car (I recommend it! You get the hang of driving on the left after awhile and have the freedom to travel at will). Always smiling, relaxed and very funny, Robbie and Kieran truly seemed to enjoy what they do.  

We spent a morning at the ESPA Spa together and loved the upbeat, energetic relaxed feel of it-not stuffy and overly hush-hush when you walk in.  Once you are inside the treatment area of the spa, it melts into a calm and serene space. The experienced staff listened to our needs and were very kind and accomodating. Great way to spend a morning! Check out their amazing pool.

We crossed our fingers and made a reservation at  Gordon Ramsay's restaraunt for a Thursday night after hearing questionable reviews.  But happily, we weren't disappointed.  The breast of duck was melt in your mouth, my mom ordered a watermelon salad that was unique and refreshing, the wine list is very good and our servers were charming.  The total bill didn't make us keel over either-similar to high end restaurants in Seattle. My sons loved hearing that we ate at Ramsay's, his only restaurant in Ireland, after watching several of his shows : ) .

My parents are world travelers and my mom felt this was one of the best hotels she has visited, for it's beauty, great staff and service, and lovely rooms.  I definitely agree!  Can't wait to come back and share this with my husband and three boys!  It was truly a little bit of heaven on earth.

Quick note:  Ask for a pass to the River Walk-a beautiful, quiet and safe place for a long walk or run.  

Also, be sure to have the hotel make a reservation for dinner at Emilia's in Enniskerry.  A small, charming and very reasonably priced italian restaurant with yummy food.  The Ritz will even drive you down to Emilia's and the restaurant will call the hotel when you are ready to be picked up.  

And don't miss the Enniskerry antique shop, quirky and full of treasures.  The owner is a gem.",5,2011,07,30
217,brilliant stay,Stayed in this hotel from 21st of May for 5 days. On arrival we where upgraded to a suite.    When we settled on the first day they sent scones and tea to our room. The food was very good. throughout our stay. Staff very helpful and corteous. This was out 3rd stay in this hotel. we will be back,5,2011,07,29
217,A little sublime island within the larger Irish paradise,"My girlfriend and I stayed in the Ritz Carlton.  The positives:  It was beautiful and peaceful.  The room we had overlooked the grounds.  It truly was paradise-verdant green everywhere.  I would just stay there for the amazing bathtub.  The service was superb.  Everything was 5 star!  If I had been with a romantic partner, I would say it would have been the perfect romantic getaway.  The negatives: really only had to do with the location.  It is a bit away from the city - about 40 minute drive.  I drove and, being an American, driving for the first time on the wrong side of the narrow Irish roads, it was stressful.  But other than that - it was an amazing, amazing place!  I would absolutely stay there again, now that I'm an expert driver in Ireland :-)",5,2011,07,27
217,Just the best hotel,"Stayed over one night while down on a business trip, the service is just exceptional. The staff can't do enough for you, little things too many to quote.
Everone is friendly all do the simple tings say hello and smile. I stayed last year and breakfast was a bit lack-lustre. Thats changed breakfast matched the hotel superb
I'd love to stay more often its just a bit on the expensive side - I'm going to look for offers though!",5,2011,07,19
217,Easily the best destination resort hotel in Ireland,"We stayed for a family weekend. From the valet greeting our stay could not have been better. The rooms (better call them suites) were luxurious, fabulous bathrooms and balconies looking out on the magnificent Sugarloaf mountains over a truly sylvan valley. The 
Gordon Ramsay restaurant was such a treat. McGills pub - what a surprise!! And then there are all the attractions of the Powerscourt Estate - manor house, speciality shopping and the Avoca terrace overlooking the famous gardens. If you are a golfer (we are not) but they have 2 golf courses. We took the hotel buggy for a trip to the river walk - such a hidden secret. Finally was the buffet breakfast on the 3rd floor terrace - so good we did not want to check out. We have stayed at many of Irelands top resorts all were good but the Ritz Carlton Powerscourt is truly great!! ",5,2011,07,03
217,Wish we could have stayed longer,Our room was beautiful and the view was breathtaking. We were treated so well by the whole staff. Everyone was helpful and went out of there way to treat us like we were royalty. Can't wait to come back!!,5,2011,06,29
217,Heavenly beds!,"Paid for a mountain view suite but didn't even have a glimpse the the mountain. First suite we got was on the ground floor with zero view. After discussions with Linus at the reception we got lobby level room with a view of nearby trees. I also asked about AMEX upgrade and was told that we already had the highest room category. Why do you sell and charge for a mountain view when you don't deliver it?

Food and wine at the lobby restaurant was good though service was the kind where you pour your wine and water yourselves but it didn't matter. At least we had the mountain view for a moment..

Downstairs pub was nice and so was the surrounding park area around the hotel. At 00:50 wedding fireworks was an added bonus right outside our window. Since we were not sleeping it was nice to watch!

Will we go back to this hotel? Most likely not since it doesn't come anywhere close to other  similar Ritz-Carltons  like Penha Longa in Sintra.",4,2011,06,21
217,Outstanding,"This was our first trip to Ireland and we could not have chosen a better ""home base"" than this property. There were six of us traveling together of different ages and gender. Some of us golfed, went sight-seeing, or just relaxed. Whatever information we needed to help us get around the area was promptly provided by the staff. The service they provided was over the top; always friendly, helpful, and/or willing to have a nice chat. We ate in McGill's one time. The food was very good and the portions were more than adequate; we even took what we could not finish back to our room. Our suite was simply magnificant. We had a mountain view suite and the scene from our balcony was breathtaking. Three of us had a massage in the spa. My massage was just what I needed after a two-hour horseback trek earlier in the day. The pool and spa area are lovely, very restful after a busy day. Friday night at McGills provided the best Irish music we've heard; and this was after a day and early night in the Dublin/Temple Bar area. The two lads who played were exceptional and we were mesmerized by their musical abilities. We had no regrets staying at the Ritz for six nights; it was the icing on the cake for our first time on the Emerald Isle.",5,2011,06,18
217,Sad way to end a wonderful trip,"This hotel did not live up to its reputation. The staff were very courteous and competent, but the room left a great deal to be desired. Our suite could use the touch of a designer with an idea of comfort, color and fit. The view from the windows was very disappointing and offered little in the way of beauty. The touch pad in the sitting area decided to oscillate on and off in the wee hours of the AM. I'm not sure how this hotel got a five star rating, but am sure that it needs to be reevaluated.",2,2011,06,17
217,Excellent  Vacation!!!!,"The Resort was beautiful.  The staff friendly professional and courteous at all times.
Staying at the Ritz made our first visit to Ireland very special.  I highly recommend this resort to anyone that wants to experience the beauty of the country.
We visited the gardens used the spa and swam in the pool almost daily.  Took the comp transportation service into town caught the bus to Bray and than the train into Dublin all very simple and inexpensive.
Ate in Bray at the seaside restaurant.  Went horse back riding at the Glendalough Equestrian Central in Annamoe.  The ride through the country side was breath taking 
I had not been on a horse for 25 years I felt very comfortable.  Our guide was so patient and careful with us.   Thank you to everyone for making our vaction so special",5,2011,06,17
217,"Hmm, dunno about 5 star!","Generally, a nice location, but some of the facilities leave you wondering how it has a 5 star rating. Notwithstanding that the brochure stated that you could order ""coffee making"" facilities, the service desk said that you must order coffee to be delivered to your room (at an additional charge"". As for breakfast, have seen better buffets in 3 star establishments. Lacked some basic ""Irish breakfast"" ingredients, and others dried out. 
While room was very pleasant, the balcony which was stated to overlook the ""garden"" (a small affair which looked like an afterthought in an open air cubby hole rather than what one expected in Powerscourt) also overlooked an (industrial like) service area, with a constant machine (air con?) noise.
The spa lacked even a sauna (which is a fairly common facility these days in spa facilities).
Overall, while the hotel was pleasant, the staff nice (though the receptionist seemed poorly trained and made a number of errors), the items above are not what you expect for a one night special (B&B with Dinner) for €340! (incidentally, the buffet breakfast mentioned above would cost an incredible €29, if purchased separately from the package. Even dafter, was a statement in their brochure that while it is safe to drink tap water, bottled water (330ml, if I recall) was available in the mini-fridge at a minimal charge (which turned out to be €5, funny idea of what is ""nominal"".
Pity, won't be rushing back.
p.s. love the bit about charging €30 to turn down your bed (in a romantic way..i.e. put a few flower petals on turned down bedspread!). This is usually done as a matter of course in 4 star hotels together with a chocolate...the Ritz Carlton gives you two lollipops!",3,2011,06,14
217,Superb in every way - can't wait to go back.,"We stayed in the Ritz-Carlton for a weekend during the Easter holidays. Luckily, the weather was absolutely beautiful and the sunshine enhanced what would have been an exceptional hotel experience under any circumstances. From the moment we entered the hotel, everything was perfect: friendly, efficient service at reception, especially as we had not booked in advance; beautiful bedroom with every comfort and luxurious bathroom.Our granddaughter was particularly taken with the television set into the bathroom mirror and the touch-button control of curtains etc. in the bedroom. The bar is welcoming and atmospheric, with stunning views to the Sugarloaf mountains; service in the bar and restaurants first class. Loved all the Victorian touches, especially at the breakfast buffet. We left feeling pampered and relaxed- just wish we'd had more time there. We've stayed in many five-star hotels, and the only one to rival this was the Four Seasons in Chicago. Will definitely be back!",5,2011,06,13
217,Astonishing hotel!,"Best hotel I've ataúde ever. Excelent service crew, huge room with amazing amenities! Hope to return for honey moon!",5,2011,06,12
217,Whats Left to Add? Its Five Stars Easy!,"This hotel is all class!  Luxury, modern slick, plush, great service, superb staff.  I've stayed at Ritz Carltons all over the USA and Puerto Rico.  This one is the best...and right outside Dublin, yet close to the ""real"" Ireland-Wicklow Gap, Dungalough, etc.!  To me, the real Irish experience comes from staying in the B & Bs.  In the Ritz, its all about pampering--not bad after a bunch of time in the great B & Bs.  So if you're near Dublin, and can afford it, stay here.  The pool, spa and gym are great.  The town down the street--Enniskerry, is postcard pretty with plenty of restaurants and pubs.  Almost got stuck due to the impending Aer Lingus pilot strike (was resolved), the concierge (Kieran) jumped to the rescue.  Top notch, top of the line!  Five stars through and through.",5,2011,06,12
217,TOTALY FABULOUS!!!!,Booked a 6 night stay through Sceptre Tours!!  Fabulous Tour company -- held our hands during our first European vacation.  Booked airline and rental car.  Loved every single thing!!  Gorgeous hotel; unbelievable price!  Amazing in every way!,5,2011,06,07
217,Loved it,"recently returned from a 3 day stay here. Place was fabulous. Thoroughly recogmended. The food may be a bit on the pricy side, but the quality & taste was great.",5,2011,06,03
217,Absolute Perfection,"The Ritz was absolute perfection!  There was not one thing that I would have changed about our entire experience here.  We were travelling with our 18 month old, and every single person working here was so kind, helpful and attentive.  The porters even indulged our son in going round and round through the revolving door, and he adored his own Ritz Kids check-in.  In particular, David O'Rourke the manager is by far the absolute best hotel manager EVER.  If there was anyone who treated every single hotel guest like a VIP, he is it.  You will be blown away by the hotel itself, the grounds, the views and the level of amazing service.  No request was too big or too small, and each request was taken care of above and beyond.  I locked myself out of my room and called from the hall phone to request a new key, and they said ""we'll be there in a few moments"" and indeed, I turned around, and there they were with the key!  We brought baby food with us due to our son's food allergies and at check-in, we mentioned, ""we have a small cooler of baby food..."" and David immediately replied ""allow me to put that in the refrigerator in the restaurant for you, and please let us know when you need the food warmed up and we'll be happy to do so.""  Everything you could possibly wish for is anticipated, not overbearing but in just a genuinely friendly, ""we're glad to work here and help you"" kind of way.  You also get free secure wifi throughout the hotel, including in the rooms (it's fast) and the if you request a crib, you do get a pack-and-play with cute bear bedding and a pillow. The pool is an experience not to be missed, so beautiful and relaxing.  Breakfast was superb, go for it!  And we didn't try to Gordon Ramsey restaurant but the in-house pub actually has really good prices for a hotel, the same prices as you would get at at the pub in the village, if not better.  We did a 10 day trip through Ireland, and next time, I think I'll stay all 10 days here!",5,2011,06,01
217,Amazing!,"There is not a single bad word I can say about this place.  Actually, it was difficult to find because my GPS lost satellite in the area, but there were enough street signs to find it.  Once I got there though, I felt like a queen from the moment I drove through the gate!  I wish I had more time to explore the grounds as they appeared SPECTACULAR!  The lady who checked us in was super nice and even allowed me to pay the M50 toll there!  She escorted me to the most luxurious room I have ever stayed in.  There was a separate room for my luggage that was bigger than the last B&B I stayed in!  The bathroom was so grand, I could've lived in that tub forever...there was a TV in the mirror!  Despite the grandeur, when I went to the pub for dinner, I didn't find the prices to be extravagant and the food was very good.  I'd go back to Ireland just to stay here again!",5,2011,05,31
217,Nicest Ritz I have stayed in!,"This hotel is a gem!  It is like going to paradise!  The staff is exceptional...attentive and genuine, friendly.  Views are breathtaking from every vantage point.  Hotel is pristine.  The spa is phenomenal.  I would go back just to stay at the hotel!",5,2011,05,22
217,We aren't the Ritzy type...but I could learn!,"This was the last stay of our trip before heading back to CA.  Wow, were we ever shocked and amazed!  It was so over the top that all we could do was live it up and love it while we had the chance. The suite was HUGE and beyond luxurious...it was decadent.  Anyway, you only live once, so we filled up the soaking tub and watched a replay of the Royal Wedding on the tv in the MIRROR.  
Then we played with the automatic controls for the curtains, the lights, the tv and so on, all located in the drawer of the nightstand.  There were flatscreens everywhere.  And controls for everything also.  And the friendliest, most helpful people around to help with everything else you could possibly want or imagine.
Unfortunately, we arrived at 5 and the gardens and waterfall we'd heard so much about were CLOSED.  What? Who closes a waterfall?  Anyway, we missed that, but the grounds and golf course were stunning.
We figured the restaurant was probably so expensive we couldn't afford it, so we just went into the darling village of Enniskerry and got some lasagne and fish and chips for dinner.  
One really weird thing is that the spa is located far away from the rooms, and there are guests wandering around in bathrobes with wet hair or towels on their heads.  We got into an elevator with a young couple dressed in robes and flip flops and it felt just a bit awkward as we tried NOT to look at them.
We had an easy drive to the airport the next morning as no one is on the road at 6 a.m.
Anyone who is fancy, rich, and loves to be spoiled to the max should stay here, definitely.",5,2011,05,16
217,Slick,Has to be one if the premier hotels in the world even tho it's owned by Nama!! Used as my reception for our wedding and everything was perfect!,5,2011,05,14
217,Lovely hotel,"This hotel is in an excellent location, just a stroll to Powerscourt House and gardens.  It's also close to Dublin.  

The hotel itself is lovely, and the staff couldn't be more helpful.  The room was spacious and the bed very comfy.  The only negative I would say is that the room was very hot - the air con was clearly not working.  To be fair, the hotel tried to fix this and  changed our room, although the second room was still on the warm side. 

We had room service on 2 nights, and I can honestly say that it's the best room service I've ever had - the food was definitely of restaurant standard, which can't be said for a lot of room service meals.

The swimming pool was great.

We'd definitely return to this hotel.",5,2011,05,12
217,What a place!,"This hotel lives up to the RItz Carlton standard in every way imaginable.  We've stayed at many of them, but the location of this hotel is incomparable.  It sits on a huge estate that is supposed to be perhaps the most elegant formal garden site in Ireland.  Since the Irish economy is in such bad shape, occupancy is down and they put us in a two room suite with every possible amenity.  It was the perfect ending to our 8-day trip around the country.  Plus, the Gordon Ramsay restaurant has a killer wine cellar.  We couldn't afford any of the thousand-dollar bottles, but they were nice to look at.",5,2011,05,05
217,TravelZoo.com got us suites here!,"It's everything you hope a Ritz Carlton will be, chandeliers, huge marbeled bathrooms with EVERY amenity and soaking tub, polilte. Polite friendly staff (except concierge who seems to not be in love with his job, maybe he just deals with complaining guests all day and needs a break). Crazy prices (22 euro for a hamburger - YIKES) but when you book with TravelZoo.com, it is affordable. Beautiful grounds and gardens (tourists driving up drive to see Wicklow Mountains!), but if you are a city person, it is TOO far from the action. Dublin is 40 minutes away. Enniskerry is closest town (1 mile) and adorable, but limited action.",4,2011,05,05
217,"Very nice, some reservations","We are unaccustomed to staying in a hotel at this level, so we jumped at the chance when this package appeared.  All the superlatives about the rooms, view, and the service that you read in these reviews are 100% accurate.  Loved our room....comfy bed, maybe the biggest we've ever slept in.  Free internet.  Lots of light. Terrific views.  Honor bar is nicely stocked but very expensive, so stay away if you're on a budget.  We missed having an electric coffee maker, but I guess the hotel wants you to pay 10 euro for coffee/tea plus its delivery to the room.  We brought our snacks, water, wine, etc.  A minor quibble.  TV in the master bath's mirror is amusing, but unnecessary.

Staff is uniformly gracious and helpful.  Always a smile.  Always accommodating.  Friendly and chatty.  Always ready with bits of information and extra service.

Food is a bit of a problem, as it is also very expensive.  We went into Enniskerry for all our breakfasts and most of our dinners during our 5 days.  Plenty to choose from.  3 places for breakfast, of which Poppy's was our favorite.  Dinners at the pub and the town's hotel bistro.  Quite good, serviceable but not terrific.  Emilio's, the Italian restaurant next to Poppy's was, however, excellent, and we do recommend a meal or two there.  

We had one dinner in the hotel, at the Sugarloaf Grill off the lobby at the big windows facing the mountains.  This was at once the the most expensive and the worst meal we had in our 10 days in Ireland.  We were tired from driving all day, and just didn't want to get back into the car to drive into town.  I had the burger. How can anyone, especially a 5 star kitchen,  so totally screw up a burger?  Puny, dried out, overcooked with a chew roll. $30.  My wife had the goat cheese tart; cheap piece of chewy commercial grade puff pastry with a piped on creamy goat cheese filling.  Disappointing. $25.  We tried to find the humor and irony in this, but, really, for a five star establishment, this was an insult to guest, food, and cookery.  We took seriously the warnings of other reviewers about the food at the hotel, so we made sure that we dined outside the hotel most of the time.

We looked at the pub, but did not try it out.  It just didn't feel right.  It's a pub in a faux Disneyland kind of way.  Expensive materials, but too pretty, too neat, no warmth.  Also no Irish, no noise, no laughter, no music.  Want a pub?....go to the real deal....they're everywhere.

A car came with our deal, and we took full advantage of that.  We drove a lot.  The roads are narrow, and can get a little confusing.  Driving does take a little getting used to.  Not much room to spare on the passenger side with hedges and stone walls whizzing by, and not much on the driver's side either.  And Irish drivers, accustomed to the roads, coming at you at seemingly breakneck speed.  But the beauty and the quiet are magical.  Particularly liked Wicklow National Park, where there are several hiking trails.  Glendaloch, also a beautiful hike, and an interesting historic site.  Beach at Brittas Bay, a spectacularly beautiful drive along the coast.  And the wonderful Mount Usher Gardens in Ashford, about a 45 minute drive south.

There's also lots to do on the Powerscourt grounds.  Beautiful formal garden.  Wonderful river walk.  Browse the garden store.  Play golf too.",5,2011,04,30
217,Staying here is like living in a picture postcard,"My sister and I spent six nights at Powerscourt and we were very pleased with our holiday experience.  We explored as much of the country, via car and rail, as was practical for us whilst still enjoying the exquisite beauty of the hotel, Powerscourt estate and County Wicklow. The weather was picture perfect for the entire week and many locals told us this was the best month of the year to tour Ireland.  The Ritz lives us to Ritz standards.  Our only disappointment was the lack of an iPod hookup and a charge to listen to music. 

Enniskerry Village is a brief ten minute walk from the hotel and is a remarkably quaint venue to take meals and provision for drinks and snacks.  Restaurant quality is extremely high, with a particular call out to Pandan Court for some of the best Chinese food we have ever had.  It may seem counter intuitive to eat Asian food in Ireland but we can assure the reader that this 25 Euro prix fixe dinner experience will not disappoint!  The 185 bus takes you to the Bray DART station for easy access to Dublin and points beyond, and we found the Irish rail system to be dependable in all categories.",5,2011,04,26
217,Perfect hotel in a country side,"I was on a conference there and I'liked this place very much. Actually it's rather far from Dublin (90 EUR for the taxi from the airport), but if you want to concentrate on work or leisure (golf, spa) than it's a perfect place. Wi-fi is free of charge. Breakfasts are perfect. There is a rear irish pub on the ground flor which is much cheaper than minibar in your room.
Stuff is very  friendly.
Unfortunatly I didn't play golf there but the plece is real good for it (see picture of my view from room).",5,2011,04,21
217,Amazingly luxurious accommodations,"This was simply the most luxurious hotel I have ever stayed in.  We had a garden suite and were dismayed that we were only there for one night, as we loved the comfort, convenience, quality of food, attentiveness of staff, and most of all, the comfortableness of the bed!

The walking trails on the property are wonderful, and we saw many people taking advantage of them.  If we had been there longer, we certainly would have tried the river walk.

Although it took a map, GPS, and directions to get there, it was well worth it!",5,2011,04,20
217,Simply the best hotel I have ever stayed in,"My wife and I wanted to go someplace special for our 30th anniversary.  I saw a deal from Sceptre Tours for Ireland - one week with hotel, car rental and airfare at a packaged price that was good value.  We had stayed at a Ritz (Naples, FL) on our 10th anniversary and knew how impressive of an hotel chain they are.

The hotel is not very far off one of the major highways running south of Dublin - relatively convenient to the Southeast coast and a short drive into the city.  We liked the location as it seemed like we were in a different world; you drive down narrow, stone walled line streets in a beautiful and lush rural setting with quaint Enniskerry a short walk away and the Powerscourt Gardens next door...

The hotel is simply stunning.  The lobby and main level restaurant have huge windows overlooking beautiful mountains.  The grounds are gorgeous.  The pool is incredible and a wonderful place to relax and unwind; probably the nicest pool and spa area I have ever seen.  The exterior of the rear of the hotel is outstanding as well.

Regarding our room, as part of the package with Sceptre we opted to upgrade to a suite (also included an upgrade to an automatic and GPS for the rental car).  The suite is the nicest hotel room I have ever stayed in.  It is huge, especially for European standards.  You walk into a tile lined foyer with the first of two bathrooms and a bar/butlers pantry with minifridge.  The sitting room is hardwood and appointed with beautiful furniture.  The bedroom and master bathroom (#2) are gorgeous, this bath comes with a walk in shower (rainshower, full steam shower as well), separate water closet, large garden tub and sink with large mirror and the TV built into the mirror.  It is all beautifully tiled with extensive trimwork and elegant decorations.  The rooms come equipped with panels that control the lighting, HVAC, etc - we really like this effective use of technology.  I cannot say enough how much we enjoyed our room, the pool and the hotel as a whole.

We arrived midday and they were able to get us into a room fairly quickly, which we appreciated after flying through the night.

While we had little to complain about there are a couple of very minor things to mention.  First, the staff is very helpful (Robbie in concierge, Paul at the front desk - were a couple who stood out) but several are young and with concierge closing early getting good recommendations on places to eat could be a challenge.  We found out from a local restauranter that they have menus of nearby restaurants but we were never offered them.  The price for food is very high, as you might expect in a Ritz, as we paid $66 US for two sandwiches in the Sugarloaf restauarant (and frankly the French Dip sandwiches could have used more meat).  We also ate at the pub one night which was okay and not quite as expensive (the pub did have different activities or music acts on different nights, especially the weekend).  We did not eat at the Gordon Ramsey restaurant as we did not want to spend that much but several nights I was not sure that it was even open.  Frankly we were quite surprised how it seemed like we had the hotel to ourselves as we were there when it was very slow, especially during the weekdays - which we did not mind!  Having a fabulous huge pool and steam room to ourselves was a delight!  While it was not a significant hassle there were some families there with young kids that were running around more than we would have preferred.  Don't get me wrong, we raised three children of our own and know what that can be like...but how some parents are oblivious to their kids running roughshod and disturbing other guests is beyond me.

Bottom line, this is a magnificent hotel that we hope to stay at again. I cannot recommend it highly enough!",5,2011,04,09
217,Beautiful Powerscourt Ritz & Enniskerry....a bit off the beaten path but worth it!,"Almost goes without saying that the Ritz here was fantastically beautiful, set in the Wicklow mountains, just up the hill from charming Enniskerry!  My daughter and I traveled to Dublin for St. Patrick's Day 2011 (more about that later!) which was also her 21st birthday.  I booked the flight/hotel/car package with Sceptre Tours about 5 months prior to departure, for what I thought was a really great price.  As it turned out, I passed on the car once we arrived, as the insurance was hideously expensive and I just wasn't certain we would use it that much as we were planning to spend a good bit of time in Dublin and along the coast.  Boy, was that a wise move for us!  The roads through the Wicklows are narrow, winding, and confusing -- in my opinion, best left for cabbies and buses.  We found a bus at the airport that took us as far as Bray (the closest ""large"" town to Powerscourt and home to the commuter train station where we purchased a 7 day train ticket for transport to and from Dublin, Malahide, etc.) then hopped a cab the rest of the way to Powerscourt (about a $20 cab ride).  Once at the really lovely hotel on the breathtaking grounds, we were told that our ""garden view room"" was not ready (the place appeared to be deserted for the first 3 days we were there, so not sure who was hogging our room or why it wasn't yet readied), but that for an extra 10 euro/day we could move immediately into a ""mountain view room"".  Not a tough decision after traveling for nearly 20 hours, so off we went to the upgrade.  And WOW....what a 10 euro/day view it was!!!!  Worth WAY more....absolutely gorgeous, and complete with a helicopter landing pad.  The room was huge, beautifully appointed and meticulously clean.  The bathroom was huge, marble, and well laid out for 2 girls with lots of stuff!!!  The ""closet"" was really more of another room....quite lovely.  The spa/workout facility are lovely as well, and the swimming pool is like none I had ever seen --- amazing and tranquil...great place for a nap if there aren't any kids splashing about!  The restaurants are expensive as other reviewers have complained about, but we ate in the lobby one morning from the breakfast buffet and were only charged for a Continental Breakfast since we weren't interested in the meat, potatoes, etc. (about 9euro each).  It was all exquisite and delicious, and well worth the price and convenience!  One evening, we ate in the Pub downstairs.  Fun atmosphere, friendly staff, and SO delicious Bangers & Mash!!!  There are plenty of options around for breakfast - either next door at the Powerscourt Estate (not sure what time it opens), or down the hill which is a gorgeous morning walk, to Enniskerry.  If you're not up to the walk (the return trip is mostly uphill), the kind folks at the Ritz will whisk you down to the village in their little Audi which stands ready to ferry visitors back and forth from ""town"".  All of the merchants in the village know their number and ring them to come fetch you for a return ride to the hotel....quite nice!!  There is a bus that comes through Enniskerry about every 1/2 hour or so; one goes all the way into Dublin, the other goes over to Bray and the train station.  As I said, we purchased a 7 day train pass so that we could come and go easily to Dublin.  Turns out, the bus (which we took into Dublin on St. Pat's Day) was a great way to go too, but the scenery along the coast on the train is too good to pass up!  Mass transit runs until around 11:00pm or so, but cabs are available in Dublin and will HAPPILY take you all the way to Powerscourt for about $65.00 (I think I paid 52 euro one night).  The hotel IS out of the way....make no mistake.  You will incur some sizable transportation costs in the course of a week either way --- driving or taking public transit/cabs....but it was SO nice having that lush retreat in the countryside to return to - by whatever means - at the end of a long day of sightseeing in the city!!!!  Would NOT have changed the experience and stayed in Dublin even for the cost savings....WELL worth the travel, and fun to see how the locals live, chat with the cabbies, etc.  Back to the food in Enniskerry:  There are several little restaurants and 2 pubs.  For breakfast, The Kingfisher has the most delicious scones and cappuccino I have ever had (they have other stuff too, but we eat light for breakfast), Poppy's has all sorts of hot food, bakery items, etc.  We ate a late lunch at Mac's Bar where they had a ""Burger & a Pint for 10 euro"" special running which was really quite good.  We ate one other time at their hotel/restaurant next door and found the fare to be good there too.  Twice we had dinner at the charming, upstairs Italian restaurant, Emilia's.  Great pasta, good wine, wonderful cozy atmosphere!!  We loved this place!!  The Ritz will arrange for a taxi to take you to dinner at Johnnie Fox's --- up the mountain a piece from Enniskerry and the highest pub in Ireland!!  Even if you have a car, take a taxi!!!  The ride up is harrowing and circuitous to say the least (in the dark), and the drive back after a few pints in the pub would not be wise!!  It's a large place, known for their seafood and Irish entertainment.  We passed on ""the show"", but heard some great music later in the pub.  The mussels were delicious, as was the roasted Irish salmon, and the crab roulade was to die for!  I'm going to cut this short as it really isn't a review of Dublin, but here are a few suggestions:  A restaurant called Dunne & Crescenzi near Trinity College was a wonderful Italian restaurant we wished we had gotten to a 2nd time.  Really good!  We pretty much just grazed along the way, but don't miss Gogarty's Pub in the Temple Bar area, especially if you are there for St. Pat's Day.  Great pub with the best old American music ever! HaHa...it's true!  Regarding St. Pat's Day there, it is quite a spectacle, but not for the feint of heart or claustrophobes!!!  Arrive at the parade route by 9 or 10 and expect to stand there for about 4-5 hours with waiting (parade started at 1) and viewing.  The parade itself was somewhat bizarre, more on the order of Mardi Gras or Halloween, but interesting.....for awhile.  We left our viewing post and headed for Gogarty's before the crowd dispersed and that was a good move.  It becomes a MOB SCENE in the pubs!  No food service, but they somehow manage to fill everyone with plenty of beer!!  It's fun to meet people from all over; everyone is in a very festive mood, that's for sure!  As the evening wears on and everyone has been at if for a good 8 or 9 hours, it turns into more of a giant mosh pit (for lack of a better description) and you would be well advised to watch your step for broken glass and vomit.....get the picture??  It is REALLY fun and something to experience....but be forewarned...it gets a wee bit crowed & crazy there!  Guiness is well worth seeing....the building is amazing and it does come complete with a Pint and a view of Dublin!  We also enjoyed Kilmainham Gaol -- the old prison.  You can get close via the little light rail that goes through the city, then walk over to the gaol (jail).  The tour is really good and it's a GREAT lesson on Irish history.  Cheap too!  Jameson is a pricey little tour, so we just parked it in the lobby bar for a Jameson Hot Toddy and a rest, then moved on.  Last but not least, take the train beyond Dublin to the last stop (3 or 4 from Dublin) to Malahide....a lovely little beach town.  You can walk down to the beach, there are a few little shops (the boys from U2 have places there I'm told), and of course restaurants and pubs.  A friend of mine from England says the BEST PUB IN THE WORLD is in Malahide...it's called Gibney's, and I believe he may be right.  Great atmosphere...and if the owner, Barry, is there, he's happy to sit down and tell you the history of the place and the family.  Great guy....great hospitality!!   Enjoy Ireland...it is a WONDERFUL, beautiful place!!!!",5,2011,04,05
217,exceptional!!!!!,"where do  I start???we had an amazing stay at the ritz carlton,from the moment we arrived we were treated like royalty,staff are so attentive without being over powering,they can not do enough for you.The rooms are so spacious and clean(the only little thing I would say is that tea and coffee making facilities are not available in room,this was a bit disappointing as I am caffine addict!!!).We decided to go to the village of Enniskerry so we rang reception for a taxi,when we arrived for our ""taxi""we were shown to the hotels courtesy car and driver,the car was fantastic and this was free from the hotel,they also picked us up too(our driver Greg was very friendly and gave us good advice on where to go and what to do).,the food is beautiful too very expensive but really worth it,over all I would definitly suggest this hotel if you are looking to get away from it all and enjoy luxury surroundings,It truely is a beautiful experience,personally I would like to say Thank you to Suzie who was very helpful to me and I know she went out of her way to be of assistance....wonderful experience...I most definitly will be back..",5,2011,03,30
217,VERY relaxing and luxurious break !,"My husband took me here as a very special birthdaytreat. It was sooo.. peaceful & relaxing.
A superb place to relax & unwind. The beds are the most comfotable we have ever slept in - super pillows as well !!  The Sugar Loaf Lounge has a lovely relaxing settees  -good for reading the paper & watching the world go by. The pool area is stunning - unlike any other we have ever seen &  (again those words!! ) soo.. relaxing. The only weak link is the food  - we feel it is too expensive . A real plus is that it is in the grounds of the Powerscourt Estate , beautiful Powerscourt House with its fabulous gardens & grounds . Powerscourt House includes on of the super Avoca restaurants & shop.",5,2011,03,28
217,Fantastic,"Wife and I stayed where supposed to stay here for only 1 night but couldn't resist changing plans to spend another night in this fantastically beautiful and super luxurious hotel. All room controls are via touch pad, including curtains. The spa is top notch and the hotel resturant was great for breakfast and dinner. We also dined in the Gordon Ramsay resturant on property and would have preffered to spend our money in the upstairs grill. finally had to drag the wife away by telling here, ""honey we came here to Ireland, and this aint it, but it's nice!""",5,2011,03,26
217,Wonderful relaxing one night break - looking forward to return,My husband booked a one-night stay for a birthday treat for me and we absolutely loved every second.  We were upgraded on arrival to a suite and the staff were so kind as to give me a card and chocolates for my birthday.  As other reviewers have said the staff are excellent - we used their compliementary bikes for a spin around Powerscourt - by the river - enjoyed the lovely dinner in the Sugarloaf restaurant and great breakfast - which were part of our package.  Just did not want to leave so booked in for Sunday lunch in the Gordan Ramsay restaurant - which was so reasonable for what we got.        As others have said the swimming pool is a joy to swim in and after 6 pm when the children leave it is a very relaxing area.  Just make sure you wear slippers\flip flops in the pool area as some people wear outdoor shoes.  Looking forward to returning,5,2011,03,18
217,Great Hotel in a Great Location,"I can't begin to say enough good things about the RC Powerscourt. From the moment we walked in to our early-morning check-out, the hotel and staff were more than we expected. We had originally booked a travel package that included a six-night stay here in one of the Garden View suites. When we checked in we decided to upgrade to one of the Mountain View suites for an extra 10 Euros per night...it was worth every penny! The Garden View suites overlook a small garden and the hotel parking lot adjacent to it. The Mountain View suites overlook the water fountain and the back lawn of the hotel and the Wicklow Moutains in the distance. They also have a long balcony where you can rest (as long as it isn't raining) complete with two lounge chairs and a bistro table and chairs set.

We didn't take advantage of all that the Powerscourt had to offer as we were usually off seeing various sites in Ireland. However, the hotel looks exactly as you would expect and the staff are as helpful and courteous as you should expect. We paid a visit to the Concierge and/or front desk almost every day to ask their opinion of what we were thinking of doing or how to get there. Not only did they answer our questions, but they often elaborated to provide us with more description and information than thought we would get.

The only restaurant we ate at was their Irish pub McGills. It was never crowded - probably because we were staying during the week - and the bartender/waiter would come by as we ate to ask us about our day and what we had done. For being the Powerscourt's most inexpensive restaurant, they don't slack on the food. They have a great selection of traditional Irish fare that were both filling and flavorful.

Finally, while the Powerscourt isn't in the heart of a city, its location is still fantastic. There is the Powercourt Golf Club across the street and the Powerscourt House and Gardens just down the road. The House and Gardens should be on anyone's must-do list when visiting the Dublin area, but it's even better that it's just a five-minute walk. The religious ruins of Glendalough and the Wicklow Mountain National Park are about a 30-minute drive and the commuter rail station is only a 15-minute bus ride from Enniskerry just down the street for an easy trip into Dublin.

I don't know what the Powerscourt would have cost us for a six-night stay without the travel package we booked, but I know that for the room, service, and location we got it would probably still be worth every bit of it!",5,2011,03,16
217,Magnificent,"The Ritz-Carlton Powerscourt is an amazing hotel. The grounds and building are gorgeous and the staff couldn't have been more helpful. We were able to check in early, having just arrived from an overnight flight and very tired. Our suite was gigantic! The concierge was also able to arrange a doctor's visit for me, as I had fallen ill. They offer a complimentary shuttle to the town nearby where there are a couple of restaurants. It is very near Dublin and made a great base camp for our week's stay in Ireland. The pool, hot pool, and sauna are so beautiful and the view from the Sugar Loaf lounge is breathtaking. I hope I have the opportunity to stay again and experience the superior service and location.",5,2011,03,16
217,How the other half live!,"This is the most opulent hotel I have ever stayed in: built with impeccable taste just a year before the Celtic Tiger stopped roaring in Ireland. Speculation has it that this luxurious hotel is now owned by the country's bad bank, NAMA, but it doesn't feel hit by the recession. The day we stayed, Justin Bieber was a fellow guest and a fortnight before we arrived, Gordon Ramsey had been here to view his only Irish restaurant. It is a beautiful hotel from the grand foyer to the rooms complete with touchscreen curtain openers but the staff are the icing on the cake. From the check-in staff to the restaurant waiters to the concierge and the housekeeping, they were friendly, efficient and keen to help. The Ramsey restaurant is pricey but it is worth it for the taste sensation. The Irish pub is a lovely touch and the Swarvosky crystal lit pool is a dream.",5,2011,03,12
217,Little Piece of Heaven!,"Can't wait for opportunity (or is that excuse) to return to RC, it was just a great experience and could highly recommend.  Treat yourself to a suite it will be worth it.........We had the good fortune to be at the Chef's Table in the Gordon Ramsay Restaurant, and this was just fabulous!  Every course was brought forward by the Chef who created it, who explained his dish with pride. All of the staff were professional and courteous and very helpful without exception.  Roll on next excuse!",5,2011,03,11
217,Fabulous Stay at the Ritz Powerscourt,"We booked this hotel on a pay for two nights, get the third free special. What a deal! It was an absolutely gorgeous property and we were treated wonderfully from our first minute on site. The staff was extremely hard-working and gracious, from the front desk to the bar tenders in McGill's. Our room was enormous--two double beds, mountain view. There was a dressing room within the room that was HUGE--it had FOUR closets. I have a guest room in my house that is smaller than this dressing room was. The bathroom was huge too.

We had several meals on site (breakfast was included in our package), went to the spa (heavenly) and walked from the hotel to Powerscourt Gardens. It's just such a beautiful setting. I truly felt as though I was gentry staying at my country estate with all my servants...a girl can dream! Would absolutely stay here again and recommend it others.",5,2011,03,10
217,"Top marks for the Gordon Ramsay restaurant, the spa and fitness centre but the rooms lack something.","Booked their 'reconnect' package which gives room, bed and breakfast with €75 resort credit. The room booked was a 'garden view'. Room 519 was allocated to us and my first impressions of the room were disappointing. The view was of the small landscaped garden (don't confuse it with the gardens of Powerscourt house which you can't see from the room) and a portion of the hotels service area. The decor of blue wallpaper made the room feel cold and dark.

A phone call to reception soon put matters right and it was worth paying for an upgrade to a 'mountain view' room. The amount I paid for the upgrade seemed small compared to the difference in room size, comfort and outlook.  Tea and coffee making facilities are available on request and these were delivered to the room in next to no time. I would fault the quality of the bathroom amenities. It almost felt as if they were rationing soap, shampoo etc and there were none of the usual combs, toothbrushes etc that one expects in a five star deluxe hotel. Management please leave something local like Butlers Irish Chocolates by the bed instead of cheap lollipops. 

For some it might be worth noting there is no club lounge in this Ritz Carlton.

My expectations for the dinner at the Gordon Ramsay restaurant were high and I have to say these expectations were exceeded. Absolutely first class and worth every cent.  We jumped at the unexpected invitation to tour the kitchen. You all did a great job.

Thank you Anne in the Sugarloaf lounge.

I use the gym every day and at this hotel I found the quality and variety of the fitness machines to amongst the best and when you take into account the comfort and cleanliness of the changing room, haman and pool its up there with the top. Only the Peninsula Hong Kong would have the edge but no where else that I've been to.

Breakfast croissants were perfect.  

In summary top marks for the Gordon Ramsay restaurant, the spa and fitness centre but the rooms lack something.",4,2011,03,07
217,NOT the most family friendly; Think again,"Stayed for 3 nights with our 3 kids hoping for a nice family holiday.  Despite a number of amenities that claim to cater to children, most didn't actually exist.  Game room with very little (movies, ping pong, Wii) that actually worked, which wasn't even open during the week.  A swimming pool open until 9pm, but closed to children after 6pm, just like the game room.  Golf buggies for hire to tour the grounds that didn't actually exist.  

The positives?  Excellent food, luxurious rooms & bathrooms, beautiful local scenery and Powerscourt estate grounds.  I'd probably consider coming back...just not with children.",3,2011,02,21
217,Theft,"We enjoyed a ""Valentine's Retreat"" package on 12/13 Feb. Two days later, however, we received notice that a further €72 had been charged to my card, for ""honor bar"" services we had not actually incurred. The hotel refused to accept our word and insisted on the charge. Ergo: insist on being accompanied to your room to certify your honor bat contents when checking in. Honour is certainly not a part of this hotel's behaviour.
Alex Corcoran",1,2011,02,17
217,Not worth the money!,"Nice location but pity they didn't build a hotel with a bit more warmth & character. Lacks atmosphere. No nice nooks or snugs to chill in. Reminded me of a tacky cruise ship interior. Staff are very helpful & friendly but the overall package is lacking. Few gripes include .....cold shower in the morning, shower handle was broken, fan in bathroom droned constantly despite all switches turned off. Don't want to nit pick but ordered coffee after dinner & never arrived,menu choice was poor, ordered steak medium/well it arrived medium/rare etc......would of expected better service from a hotel of the image it trys to portray. This is the first review I've written & I am not one to moan but we left the hotel deflated & wallet considerably lighter. Would not recommend this hotel to a friend & nor would I stay there again. Shame as its a great location badly utilised.",3,2011,02,14
217,Perfection,"Dont often leave reviews, actually this could be the first! - The hotel is spotless. The decor is 2nd to none and the staff could not have been more helpful. We stayed in a Mountain View suite which to be fair comes at a price a little above what we would normally fork out but once you enter the room you can see why you pay the premium. Simply stunning. The Mountain view was of course exactly what it was billed as. The balcony over looked the rear gardens and water feature and the view extended to the Wicklow mountains otherwise known as the sugar loaf mountains due to their sloping feature. Fantastic.

Dinner in Gordon Ramsay's signature restaurant. I had eaten here before a few years back when the hotel opened. I thought then the staff were possibly a little pushy with offering champagne on arrival at the front entrance. Seemed like a nice touch to me to I got the bill and seen it was something like €20 a glass lol - Anyway, none of that this time round. The food was fantastic and our waiter who's name i forget was superb. Attentive but not over doing it.

The spa was again as you would expect gleaming and the over all feeling was one of total relaxation. 

The Hotels pub - McGills - Great service and will stay up as long as you want to stay up! Possibly not a great idea as we stayed up pretty late!

To be fair its the first time I've felt home sick when i arrived back at my home! I just wanted to go back to the comfort of the hotel!

5 star verging on 6 - Perfect weekend!",5,2011,02,11
217,Fabulous,Have stayed in this hotel on a number of occasions.  Pure luxury :-) I have been upgraded (free of charge) on a couple of occasions to a suite.  The hotel is set in lovely grounds and the restaurant and spa are fabulous. Possibly the most comfortable beds ever!!,5,2011,02,07
217,Fabulous!,"Stayed here in January for 2 nights.  Our room was amazing - very spacious and the bed was amazingly comfy and absolutely huge!  Loved the TV in the bathroom.  On our first night we dined in McGills Pub.  Food was very good.  I was a little taken aback to be charged €10 for a glass of pinot grigio (sp?) wine...particularly when the measures were not that large.  But I had brought my fiancé here for a birthday treat so we decided we might as well live it up and splash out.  On the second night we dined in the SugarLoaf restaurant, situated beyond reception.  The food was expensive but excellent and the staff were extremely friendly and attentive. The pool and the jacuzzi are great.  It can get very busy after 9am though.  Breakfast was buffet style with a great selection of hot food, breads, fruits and so on.
We were a little surprised to have to pay €10 to access the internet for 45mins max.  Given the amount of money you expect to spend there with room, meals and so on, I would have thought they could offer the business centre free of charge to guests (like a lot of other hotels do).  But that's a small gripe.
The staff are great here.  There is nothing they won't do for you.  We were treated like royalty for the entire duration of our stay.  I will definitely be back here!",5,2011,01,23
217,Best of the best,"My husband and I have been world travelers for over 25 years, staying. At Ritz and Four Seasons and other five star hotels, but none comes close to the Powerscourt Ritz--from the stunning rooms with their separate dressing rooms, elegant baths and high tech, to the amazing pool and bike rides on the gorgeous grounds! We'd give it 6 stars!",5,2011,01,05
217,Incomparable - fantastic hotel,"I won a prize of a night in the Ritz Carlton with dinner at the Gordon Ramsey Restaurant. What can I say? Me and my friend were treated like princesses, we were upgraded to a suite on arrival, the porter carried our bags up for us and gave us a great overview of our surroundings, our suite was outstandingly beautiful, T.V. even in the bathroom mirror ( vital as the x factor final was on) The waiter in the Gordon Ramsey Restaurant took such good care of us, and even gave me a tour of the kitchen after our meal.  The next morning the breakfast was lovely and we finished up with a trip to the spa. Magnificent, beautiful and so relaxing. I'd had a terrible week and this hotel and its wonderful staff made the weekend brilliant. Thank You",5,2011,01,01
217,Food and beverage experience does not match the high prices charged.,"The room rate was reasonable enough, but the food and beverage costs were extremely high without the corresponding experience being delivered.
Breakfast tables were not immediately available on any morning of our stay so we were sent back to our bedroom without any sense of embarrassment to await a call when one became available. To have a cup of tea delivered to the room while you were waiting incurred a delivery charge which brought the price for one cup of tea to €10 before a tip. 
Dinner at the Gordon Ramsay restaurant was expensive which we fully expected. What we did not expect was to have the tail end of a wedding reception going on in one half of the dining room with a group of bored children running backwards and forwards in and out of the restaurant for the duration of our dinner. There was no sense from the staff that they considered it inappropriate or unusual to have children running around the restaurant at 10 o'clock at night. 
The restaurant's wine list had some of the highest mark-ups we've seen for a while. The cheapest bottle of champagne on the list was almost €100. Given that Ramsay's flagship Royal Hospital Road restaurant in London delivers seamless 3 michelin star service and a bottle of champagne costs a third less at £55, it is no wonder he is too embarrassed to include the Powerscourt wine list on his website for comparison to the wine lists in his more established restaurants. An after dinner amaretto appeared on the bill at €18 which I think is the most I have ever been charged.
The good stuff was a nice room, fantastically comfortable bed, spacious bathroom, generally friendly and helpful staff, a nice spa area with a large pool (children welcome until 6pm), and most of all a really beautiful setting.",4,2010,12,30
217,Five stars in a four star world,"We recently returned from a five-day stay at Ritz Carlton Powerscourt (roughly 30-minute drive south of Dublin, due west of Bray.)  NB:  driving directions are less than helpful (a constant throughout Ireland; RC web writers must have gone native.)  You need to exit highway (M6 southbound), follow directions, get back on M6 northbound, take first exit, and follow directions.   It is frustrating, but make the effort-this is one of the finest hotels in Europe.

The hotel is built into the side of a gently sloping hill, adjacent to the Powerscourt house and gardens, on the estate grounds.  The elliptical structure found on the web site reveals the importance of mountain-view rooms: the view of the Wicklow Mountains is worth the cost of upgrade.  Garden view means you’ll be looking over a parking lot, but all the common areas overlook the mountains.

A hotel can never outrun bad personnel.  You can have the best property in the world, but if your employees are rude, unhelpful, or insensitive, you’re days are numbered.  I can honestly say, I have never encountered a more pleasant, professional, resourceful, or likable staff.  Marina (guest staff relations), Roman, Michael, and Krys (sp? front desk factotum nonpareil) exemplify this principle of good management.  Even a member of the maintenance staff assigned to clean up a shattered bowl in our suite found time to sit with us and explain the essentials of the bodhran and Irish dancing (“tap your foot, roll this pencil, like a drum, but between your fingers”) as he finished sweeping up broken glass.

The hotel is three years old; lobby and common areas spotless; rooms ample (our mountain view suite had a full kitchen (including microwave and high end cappuccino maker), dining-living room, bedroom, and dressing room.  Doors opened to a broad patio.  One and a half baths, including heated bathroom floors, walk-in rainforest shower, and oversized tub, all lit via touch screen controls…well, you get the picture.  This was Thanksgiving week, so of course these rooms were under 400 Euro/night, all taxes included.  Summer rates are much higher.

I never mention spas.  I’m mentioning the spa.  Not for the treatments, which I presume are indulgent (is that redundant?)  Rather, the pool, hot tub, steam and sauna facilities are wonderfully designed.  All are in close proximity to each other, and a round hall design prevents all manner of unfortunate sightings of those who might consider skipping a meal once in a while.  Of course, RC provides lush changing rooms, but this does not prevent the privileged amongst us from wandering the lobby in robes and slippers…but I digress.

Couple of quick notes:  the village of Enniskerry, a short hike downhill from the Powerscourt estate, services the hotel.  The few shops include a laundrette (easy to operate, or leave clothes for a few hours).  I find local laundry services key to avoiding the exorbitant cost of in-hotel wash-and-dry.  The ride to Bray train station takes 5-10 minutes, parking is plentiful, and the trains to Dublin (DART) frequent: no need to drive into city from hotel.

Finally, a note of caution:  Apparently the Irish have concluded food does not need seasoning.  Nor, for that matter, flavor.  I urge all in-bound travelers to lower your culinary expectations, and regrettably, RC Powerscourt is not immune from this warning.  That said, I cannot recall a finer hotel experience in recent memory.",5,2010,12,26

217,Lovely Setting,"- Service: Everyone was courteous & helpful, especially Annie in the Sugar Loaf Cafe & Lounge.  Good response from the Concierge.
- Property: Lovely setting in the mountains of Co. Wicklow.  Away from bigs crowds.  Maybe ready for some updates.  Noticed some fading upholstery and rugs.  The chairs  in Sugarloaf cafe are uncomfortable and you can't reach your place at the table; in the Sugarloaf lounge area, there's no place to put your feet under the table.
- Room:  Nice; prettiest bathroom I've ever been in; comfy beds, like sleeping on a cloud.  Furnishings and draperies also ready to be updated.  Need more electrical outlets.  Nice balcony; liked the extra room for closet, luggage storage.  A few more hangers would've helped.  Had to hang things over chairs.
- Food:  Adequate, overpriced.  Loved the scones;  great coffee, should be at 5 euro/cup.
- Pool:  Fantastic, gorgeous, easy to get in/out of, comfortable loungers surround the pool, huge towels; experience spoiled briefly by parents who can't/don't/won't control their kids.
- Spa Treatments:  Didn't use them;  outrageous rates.
- Amenities:  Turn-down service - lollypops? really?  Can't the Ritz afford a truffle or a chocolate mint?  It's all in the details.",4,2010,11,26
217,The best hotel in Ireland,"Myself and my sister stayed here for the two day Christmas Package in 2009.  This included 2 nights B&B with 2 dinners.  
We booked the mountain view suite which was out of this world.  Everything you could possibly need in a hotel room is included here.  I have an apartment that is smaller than this suite!  The concierge was very helpful and gave us all the information we needed for our stay.
We strolled around the Powerscourt Estate which is worth doing.  It is very relaxing especially as it is so quiet around Christmas time.
Our package included a buffet dinner on Christmas Eve.  We were blown away by the food.  The selection was incredible and everything was delicious.  One year on and we still think of the things we ate and how good it was!  
On Christmas Day, however, we dined in Gordon Ramseys restaurant which was a big disappointment.  The quality and taste of the food did not match the food from the night before.  It was bland and unappetising - not what we were expecting.
Nonetheless the bar was great.  A very relaxing, cozy pub style bar where we ordered some tasty cocktails to finish off the evening.
We ordered room service for breakfast on both mornings and both the food and presentation was fantastic.  
I cannot stress enough how friendly and professional the staff all were in this hotel.  For example, when we were strolling around inside the hotel, one of the hotel staff asked us if we would like a quick tour.  He spent time telling us about the story behind the hotel and answered any questions we had.  You simply will not be able to match this type of service anywhere in Ireland.
I will definitely return to The Ritz again.",5,2010,11,23
217,earns 5 stars,"Staff great, town near by delightful, the room was incredible (especially for Europe). The most beautiful pool I've ever seen in a resort--and the steam room was extraordinary. Great TV in bathroom, but no good stations to watch in Ireland.",5,2010,11,22
217,Country luxury,"A unique setting with spectacular views (facing South) with truly luxurious rooms.  One of the nicest RC we've ever stayed at.  Service is excellent and as always at the RC the concierge staff was truly wonderful in understanding our desire to experience restaurants and sites that were off the beaten path.  

You have to want to be in the country to truly enjoy Powerscourt as it is about 45 minutes to downtown Dublin. 

The tour of the Jameson distellery was well worth the trip.",5,2010,11,21
217,"Stunning, but beware of the bed!","Just back from an excellent stay at the Ritz Carlton. The hotel is superb. I have stayed in other 5 star hotels in Ireland and this surpasses them all. 
First up the check-in was quick and the lobby area was beautiful. it was our wedding anniversary and they upgraded us to a large suite which was excellent. 
The Suite had 2 toilets a standalone shower, bath, his and hers sinks, a large sitting area with TV, a large seperate bedroom and walk in wardrobe and a balcony over looking the mountains. It was huge and most importantly spotless. I did not have the same problems with the control panel or level of lighting in the rooms  as other guests had.
The one problem that we did have with the room however was that 1 side of the mattress seemed to have completely colladsped. It mean't that the person on the other side was constantly sliding over and made it impossible to sleep in the middle of the bed.  It was late when we noticed this so we persevered.
The Pub was nice but I would guess it would be a little small if the hotel was fully booked altough it looks like an Irish bar in any city in the world. Nice real fire though
Gordan Ramsey's restaraunt was very good, a lot extra courses so by the time the main course came we were feeling a little bloated. We also got a free cake for celebrating our anniversary which was a nice touch. Overall nice but I have had as good if not better for a more reasonable price in Dublin.
The highlight of our stay however was the pool are. It was stunning. black tiles and low lighting combined with crystals in the pool. It is like swimming in a lake at midnight. Also a large jacuzzi and Hamam it was lovely.
Overall if you want peace and quiet, or a nice romantic break then this is for you. The staff are attentive but not overpowering. The location is fabulous and good food and drink. What more could you ask for!",5,2010,11,16
217,Amazing Hotel- Great Service,Loved everything about this hotel.  Beautiful property with top level service....concierge was the best.,5,2010,10,25
217,five star through and through,"We stayed at Powerscourt for six nights at the end of September . The hotel is beautiful,our room looked over one of the wooded gardens . It had all the amenities one could ask for,anything else the concierge desk would be glad to provide. All of the staff was warm and helpful .My husband especially appreciated employee Sean's  help from the desk.He cheerfully arranged our cabs into Dublin and provided us with maps and directions to our next destination . The food in the two restaurants was excellent , and for something quick there is a pub . The large gardens up the road are breathtaking and there are stores and the castle ruins on the grounds . Enniskerry is a picturesque little town down the road,a five minute drivee or free bicycling trip from the hotel. I was very content ,my husband loved it too but wished it closer to Dublin .( The fare is 40 to 50 pounds one way).",5,2010,10,24
217,Should be much better for the price they are charging,"Stayed here for one night, Sunday 10th October 2010. I had postponed putting an entry on tripadvisor for the hotel, as I was hoping for a reply to the 4 emails to the manager high-lighting some areas of improvement that would have made our stay more enjoyable, but have not received a response back from the hotel - neither was there a response to the comment card I left. I have to state that the location of hotel is fabulous - the natural beauty of the Powerscourt Estate is breath-taking. Also the staff are extremely courteous and helpful.   

For the price we paid for our stay at the hotel for one night, our experience should have been better. We were allocated a room on the 4th floor - great sized room, very spacious and clean and exactly what we expected. But the Sugar Loaf lounge, which serves food through the day, is located at the end of the corridor to the 4th floor, and along with food smells drifting down the corridor, you have to dodge staff crossing the corridor to and from the kitchens,  and also guests going to and from the Sugar Loaf lounge. The dressing area in the bedroom is large, but we only had 8 hangars between the 4 closets . By the time we hung up our coats, and our clothes, we were draping other clothes on the back of chairs. The guest directory in our room was falling apart, with pages missing, and so we were missing the information for times food is served in the hotel, and also information on the spa. I know some people might say I should have just rang the concierge, but I didn't want to spend all my time on the phone. The reception on the televison in the main bedroom was very poor. There was no complimentary drinking water in our room - you could purchase a small bottle from the 'honor bar'(their spelling) in the room for 4 euro. A note in the guest directory said that the tap water was safe to drink. There is nothing nice about paying for water, but there is nothing 5 star about filling up your glass from bathroom sink. Every hotel I have stayed in, has provided bottled water free of charge.  

We decided to try out the spa. Got changed in our room and donned our bathrobes. The bathrobes have seen better days- they were clean but old and worn looking, and certainly not fluffy as described - I wish I had brought my own. In order to access the spa which is in the basement, we couldn't use the lift because access to the lift is in the lobby, beside the Sugar Loaf lounge and thats the last thing one would expect, to have to stroll out to the lobby in a bathrobe and slippers,with knees showing. So we took the back stairs which was freezing cold and not what we expected from a five star hotel. In the spa, I asked for wet shoes/flipflops which I have been given straight away in other spas, and the lady on reception had to go off in search of a pair for me. I noticed a lot of other guests walking around in their slippers, in the pool area  = wet slippers, not nice. A man the arrived into the pool area, with 4 cans of red bull and then sat in the jacussi drinking his cans of red bull . So not nice. Surely this should not be allowed. 

Food is expensive in the hotel, but we knew that going there. We had a snack in the afternoon in the hotels' pub McGills, which is hidden far away, down a corridor, its like they have hidden it away on purpose, and you feel like you are doing a walk of shame for considering going into a pub in a five star hotel. Glasses of wine vary from 8 to 10 euro - I asked for a glass of house wine and was charged 8 euro. Later in another part of the hotel I was charged 10 euro for a glass of house white. We didn't eat in Gorden Ramseys restaurant - why pay money (40 euro main course) for food that Mr. Ramsey hasn't cooked himself. I would pay it if he was there, but he wasn't and we decided that as breakfast was served in his restaurant in the morning, we could experience the menu he has drawn up. 

Breakfast was such a let down, we had to laugh. I think a breakfast roll from a petrol station would have been a better option. We couldn't get a table when we arrived for breakfast, as there appeared to be only 2 staff, and empty tables were not cleared and reset. We went to the buffet and found the basics - plain sausages, rashers, tomatoes - this breakfast menu was drawn up by Gorden Ramsey - he really exerted himself. If you want to push the boat out and get waffles and pancakes, you will pay 18 to 20 euro extra per portion. There was only half a spoon of scrambled egg left. I had to stand at the toaster for a few minutes to cook our own toast. A selection of yoghurts, salmon and meats were laid out, but the sun was streaming into the room and none of the food was refrigerated - just left out on various tables -we didn't fancy warm yoghurt, so avoided them . I witnessed 3 people take consecutive turns, man handling a loaf of bread as they tried to cut it themselves - there was no napkin on the bread loaf and neither did we fancy a slice of bread that was mauled by strangers hands We got to our table. A waiter offered coffee, I asked for tea and was poured a cup of tea from a large pot. There was no pot of tea left for me on the table and I didn't see the waiter again, so I only got one cup of tea to go with my breakfast - if they expect you to stand and toast your own bread, they could at least leave pots of tea on the table, so we could refill our cups ourselves.

There will be people who will stay here, and will glide through this hotel and wave their credit card and think this hotel is great . But unfortunately it's over rated and over priced for what you actually get.",3,2010,10,22
217,outstanding,"We traveled in mid-October in order to see the gardens. Ritz-Carlton gave us a lovely suite with views of gardens, heliport and Sugar Loaf Mountain. Everyone was friendly and courteous. Room was spacious with white robes and slippers that was handy for trips to lovely Swarovski-designed indoor pool [glad we took our swimsuits, especially for whirlpool by pool]. You can walk the grounds--Secret Garden etc. Nearby is Powerscourt Estate, now a lovely store [Avoca] and furniture store upstairs and cafe. The cafe overlooks the grounds. Good food and the grounds are a must-see and take about an hour to walk. Flowers, lovely roses, were still in bloom and Japanese maples were lovely. From the Ritz. ask Concierge for River Walk pass to Powerscourt Estate and experience a lovely walk for about 90 minutes or take  free bikes from hotel . On your return, check out the Powerscourt Garden Pavilion for reasonable gifts and of course, go to the cafe for tea and dessert. 
The Ritz has 3 restaurants--Gordon Ramsey, Sugar Loaf and Murphy's Pub. Breakfast is only at Ramsey's or the Sugar Loaf Lounge. Ask for menus for Sugar Loaf and Murphy's Pub [only open for dinner around 6:00.
The nearby town of Enniskerry is 5-10 minutes by car and offers restaurants and breakfast cafes--all good. See separate reviews.  Ritz-Carlton offers complimentary ride to Enniskerry.",5,2010,10,22
217,Very disappointing!!! Is this really a Ritz Carlton?,"We have stayed at this hotel on at least three prior occasions, and were very happy with service and accomodation.However this time , on the occasion of our anniversary, we were very disappointed. Despite paying a higher rate than usual and being members of the reward programme ( and it is certainly not cheap at the best of times! ) we ended up in the smallest room we have ever had at this hotel.Not only that, but the bed linen was torn, the air conditioning did not work, it was very noisy, no Bvlgari toiletries and despite submitting a comment card to reception, no one from the hotel asked us about our stay ( even when we were checking out!) In addition to that, it seems that the Ritz Carlton are offering much cheaper rates to American tourists and ripping off the natives.While I love to see Americans come to Ireland, this means we will not be going to the Ritz Carlton in Powerscourt again.We have stayed at many other RitzCarltons in America, and they are 5 star. This one is certainly not. Our reward points have not even been added on yet, despite two requests to front desk staff. Is this really a Ritz Carlton? We have stayed in far superior 4 star hotels such as the Brehon in Killarney. They truly look after their guests.",1,2010,10,16
217,Fabulous Hotel,"My wife and I spent 6 days at this hotel, and it was a wonderful experience.  It is about 45 minutes from Dublin, but if you are driving yourself, expect to get lost.  The hotel is nicely laid back off the main road, and when you walk inside, you are greeted by a large lobby overlooking beautiful and well maintained gardens.  The room is incredible.  It had to be almost 1000 square feet, and everything was immaculate.  Some of the rooms had better views than ours, but the room was spacious, comfy, and having free Internet was another plus.  It is very easy to sight see from this hotel, and the concierge was great.  He had plenty of maps, and places to see during the day.  We took the train into Dublin, which was pretty easy.  We did not want to deal with the traffic and the parking in the city.
The restaurant was quite good, and also very expensive.  We ate at different places in town during out stay, and I would recommend that.  We even went to town each morning for a wonderful Irish breakfast.",5,2010,10,12
217,Magnificent!,"Truly an amazing experience...  This hotel was impeccable from its gorgeous location at  the Powerscourt gardens to its beautiful rooms and hospitality.  You are greeted at the reception area and escorted to your room, where you are guided through the workings of the electronic window treatments, hidden television, heating/air conditioning, etc.  The room was incredibly spacious.  I've stayed in luxury New York hotels that had less room than the closet and bathroom at the Ritz Powerscourt.  There are many things to do immediately in/around the hotel.  First and foremoest, are the Powerscourt Gardens.  They are amazing and should not be missed.  In addition, the proximity to Dublin and Glendalough make it a great home base for your Irish vacation.  Our last evening of our stay at the Ritz was topped off by dinner at the Gordon Ramsay restaurant.  Although it is expensive, it is equally delicious.   I found this hotel as part of a package through Sceptre Tours.  They offer very affordable packages -- even if at first you believe the Ritz to be beyond your financial limits!  It is soooo worth the stay!",5,2010,10,12
217,Amazing experience for our wedding!,"The Ritz carlton made our wedding day  spectacular !! We were all upgraded to better rooms on check in...our room was HUGE!!! Upon arrival in the restaurant we wewre upgraded to the chefs table which made the ocassion perfect as it suited our number  perfectly ,the food was as good as we have had anywhere and all the staff made our stay there amazing. We can't praise this place enough!!!!! This is perhaps the best hotel we have ever stayed in.",5,2010,10,11
217,"Beautiful views, Wonderful Staff, Pampered Guests","We got a fabulous deal for air fare, rental car, and a week at Powerscourt Ritz Carlton, and would highly recommend this gorgeous hotel to anyone who loves luxury.  Our suite was stunning, with breathtaking views of Sugarloaf Mountain from our balcony.  The staff was helpful and friendly, the food in the Sugarloaf Lounge was wonderful, and the spa amenities were luxurious and so relaxing. Treat yourself to a week here!",5,2010,10,11
217,spectacular scenery,"I have stayed here on three occasions and would stay here again.   The location is spectacular and truly special .   It is a 20 minute drive to Dublin and there are lots of places in the vicinity of Wicklow like Glendalough and   powerscourt waterfall to visit.    Wicklow is a lovely county.    The hotel is comfortable but would like more variety in the food which is expensive.    The spa is excellent and there is golf nearby.    It is also within walking distance of Powerscourt shops and cafe which is excellent.    The location is very quiet at night so if you're into nightclubs or lots of action this is not the hotel for you.  Overall,   I would recommend this hotel,  the setting is so romantic.",5,2010,10,10
217,"Wonderful vacation at the Ritz Carlton, Powerscourt!","My husband and I and two friends took a six night vacation to Ireland.  It was a package deal that included airfare from New York and a rental car as well as the hotel stay.  The Ritz Carlton is located in a delightful area of Ireland.  The scenary is spectacular.  powerscourt gardens are ajacent to the hotel and we spent a most enjoyable afternoon strolling through the gardens.  

The hotel room was spacious, with a luxurious bathroom and comfortable bed.  It also included a sitting area which was very nice for visting with our friends and enjoying some wine and cheese in the late afternoon.

We drove our car to the train station in Bray and took the train into Dublin on two of our six days.  The other days we drove south, along the coast and went down to Waterford on one excursion.  It did take some time to orient oneself to driving on the left side of the road, and many of the country roads are extremely narrow, so one must exercise great care!

We had glorious weather and after our daily adventures we enjoyed coming back to the Ritz to relax.  The little village down the hill is quite charming with a few good restaurants and antique shop.",5,2010,10,08
217,A perfect place,This is our fifth time at this Hotel and we keep coming back for more. From the rooms to the staff to its location and setting it just doesn’t get any better. We recently stayed for the weekend with our young daughter and once again had a very relaxing time. I couldn’t recommend it enough.,5,2010,10,07
217,Amazing Hotel,"Fabulous hotel, everything we imagined and more. Completely flawless",5,2010,10,04

217,"Beautiful Hotel, but inconvenient for Dublin","We stayed for one week at the Ritz Carlton on a package deal that included a car rental for our honeymoon and it was everything we hoped it would be. The hotel grounds are so picturesque and private, staff was very professional and accomodating, and the room was spacious and tastefully furnished. We took advantage of the spa with the indoor pool, hot tub, sauna and steam room after we had our massage. The thearpists were excellent and it was a lovely way to spend the morning. Food and drink were good, but expensvie. We enjoyed going out and exploring the local area for a little more indigenous flavor. We had a wonderful stay and loved the hotel. However, there isn't much to do around the hotel unless you like nature and want to do a lot of walking/hiking. We were more interested in seeing the sights and sounds of the bigger cities as it was our first time in Ireland. Dublin is a train ride away (the trip on a the train is a very beautiful one, highly recommended), but it does take about 1 hour each way to get from the Ritz to Dublin. At night, we had to go to Bray or elsewhere in order to have something to do. Things aren't open very late unless you're in the heavily touristed areas or in a bigger city, so being so far from a bigger city was very inconvenient. In general, pubs and trains close at 11:30. There were times we were still in Dublin late and had to take a cab back, which cost 35 euros. Even though we had a car, driving on the other side on very small tight lanes is not easy, so we took public transportation anytime we could. If we could do it again, knowing that we are more interested in the night life and historic exploration, we would choose to stay in Dublin rather than the outskirts. We did like that we were forced to see more of the country (it's a beautiful place!) because we had to drive so much to get from our hotel to anywhere, but alas we spent very little time in our room and more time exploring, so it would have been better to have ""base camp"" more conveniently located.",4,2010,09,27
217,Lovely hotel with excellent service and beautiful grounds,"Staff are very helpful, kind and friendly at the hotel. They seemed quite sincere and welcoming to all the guests. The hotel grounds and surrounding park are stunningly beautiful. At first, it all appears quite stately and intimidating, but it is all absolutely lovely once you have a chance to walk around, enjoy the grounds and relax. The bed sheets, pillows and mattress were so soft and comfortable; I fell asleep straight away. The pool is very modern and romantic -- the water looks like twilight. My only regret was that we were only there for one night. I would highly recommend staying at least 2 days or more to enjoy the hotel properly. If I ever have the good fortune and opportunity to return, I certainly will.",5,2010,09,26
217,Beautiful Location,"We stayed here for 3 nights as part of our week travelling around Ireland.  On arrival the hotel staff were extremely polite and friendly.  The hotel was beautiful with an outlook onto the Sugar loaf mountain.  Very elegant.  Our room was a large suite on the 5th floor with entrance hall, guest  bathroom, sitting area, study area and ensuite bathroom and a walk in wardrobe!!!  We were on the corner Rm 522 and had a fantastic view of the hills and gardens from all the windows, all that was missing was a balcony which I believe is only available on 4th and 6th floors.  

One great feature was the control panel in the bedside table drawer which allowed you to switch all or selected lights on/off and even closed the curtains automatically.  It also let you indicated whether you wanted privacy (a red light would appear on the doorbell panel outside your door) or your room made up (green light on said panel).  The bed was huge and luxurious and with a total of 3 TVs (bedrm, lounge and ensuite) the room was quite something!

As we arrived around 4pm we had not eaten, so after partially unpacking we went to the Sugarloaf lounge around 4.30ish.  Unfortunately afternoon tea had finished, however they could offer us any dessert on the menu which would be prepared freshly for us.  I chose Creme Brulee and what a Creme Brullee it was!!!  Totally fresh, absolutely delicious and worth the wait.  

We tried out all restaurants, eating at the Sugar loaf the first night, where we had excellent service and the food was terrific.  Second night was our anniversary so we decided to push the boat out and eat at the Gordon Ramsay restaurant downstairs.  I am so glad we did.  It was very special and the food was amazing and presented with such grace by the waiters, with special thanks to the Restaurant Manager, whose name I unfortunately could not see, although I believe he may have been Polish/Eastern European.  He was utterly delightful and obviously enjoyed his job as he explained each dish, with a smile, as it arrived.  When he asked how we were enjoying our meal, we responded in the affirmative and mentioned that it was our anniversary and we were having such a wonderful time.  At the end of the meal he came out with 2 little cakes on a plate with Happy Anniversary written in chocolate.  What a lovely touch.  Then he asked if we'd like a tour of the kitchens.  Wow! what huge kitchens they were and which, we learned, served all 3 restaurants (inc. the pub) and room service, in addition to any events/weddings that were going on in the meeting rooms.  We met the Head Chef and spoke to the Pastry Chef who was in the process of inventing a new dessert for their Autumn menu.  It just made the evening so special.  On our last night we ate at the pub, fish & chips, fantastic!

We didn't go into Dublin as it seemed a bit of a trek, even with a hire car and as it was a warm day we explored the grounds and also Powerscourt House and Gardens, which are beautiful.  Unfortunately, none of the rooms at Powerscourt House appear to be open to visitors, although there are plenty of gift-type shops and for some unknown reason a furniture showroom upstairs!!! 

The spa/pool area was lovely with Swarowski crystals in the pool and comfortable loungers round the sides.  They also had a jacuzzi/vitality pool which was also good.  I was rather disappointed that unless you were having a spa treatment ( between €100-300) on the Spa floor above, you were not, as guests, allowed to use the thermal rooms on the above floor, unless you paid an additional €25 pp a day!  That was the only ridiculous thing I encountered at Powerscourt.

It was a lovely hotel in a beautiful location with superb food. Great for travelling around the area if you had a car but not particularly convenient for Dublin.",5,2010,09,17
217,Loved this hotel and its location!!!,"We stayed here for one week during the last week of August. This trip was definitely one of the best and most relaxed vacations we've taken.   The staff at the hotel was very helpful and courteous.  They would always greet you with a smile and make sure your every need was fulfilled.  You must bring your swimwear and utilize the indoor pool.  Its beautiful and relaxing. Although I will say, I wish the hotel would strictly enforce the no kids after 6pm rule more.  We went to use the pool one evening at 7pm and there were loud noisy kids running a muck! But other than that, do not pass up the opportunity to go for a swim.  The rooms were big and comfy and housekeeping was great. I had read from other members here that they do not replace your shampoo and conditioner but that was not the case at all.   We always got  full new bottles everyday even if we had some leftover from the day before. Also, their internet service was excellent! Other members here said it would only be good to check email becuase its slow but that is so not true! We watched youtube videos and did it all on our laptop without any problems.  It was superfast.  Those people who experienced slow connections need to upgrade their computers, no offense.
We only ate at Mcgills Pub inside the hotel.  If you're a chicken wing lover you must try theirs! I would pass on the fish & chips though. The rest of the time we ate in the village nearby.  Our favorite place to eat was definitely hands down Nancy Murphys.  You can't go wrong with anything you order there. The fish & chips, cajun chicken sandwich, thai shrimp, etc. We couldn't get enough. It was all delicious and so filling! We were very disappointed with the italian restaurant Emilios.  Their dinner entree servings were more like appetizers.  They left you unsatisfied and hungry! I don't get why their so cheap in their portions when they're charging high prices. Do NOT go there unless you want to leave hungry.
We took the bus to Dublin one day.  That was actually pretty fun because your amazed at how they drive these buses on such narrow roads (sit on the 2nd level). It was about an hour to the center of town and it only cost a little over 2 euros. We caught the bus from the village.  Very easy and convenient. The rest of the time we drove everywhere.  The roads aren't so bad once you get used to them but you do have to be careful on sharp curves. It was an experience.
Overall, we loved the Ritz  and its location.  It was so beautiful and relaxing there. Definitely check out the Powerscourt Garden. Its great to spend a nice afternoon there. We would love to go back one day and stay at the Ritz again :)",5,2010,09,07
217,Over the moon,"While I would expect my stay to be wonderful, I was surprised to find the experience exceeding all expectations.  What set our stay over and above was the kindness, thoughtfulness and sense of humor of the staff.  Unexpected ""bumps in the road""  were met with all of the above.  The concierge (Robby & Ciran (sp)) in particular were most wonderful in so many ways.  Thank you for a wonderful trip that will always be remembered with a smile on my face.",5,2010,09,03
217,"breathtaking views, luxury and service at its best","this hotel is beautiful, with views over sugar loaf mountain set in parkland with a golf course on site. The rooms are truly luxurious an d the staff exceptionally helpful and friendly. If you dont fancy the Gordon Ramsey cuisine then there is the option of a quaint Irish pub within the hotel, you would go a long way to taste such delicious food! There is a games room for the younger children and bikes available free of charge. The gym is very well stocked and the spa is the height of luxury if you really want to spoil yourself. The small village where the hotel is situated is characteristic with a small Italian restaurant where the food is also good and many tea rooms. Def worth a visit!",5,2010,09,02
217,Lovely setting but service poor,"Stayed here with my folks for the Jose Carreras concert in Kilruddery House. Beautiful hotel with magnificent rooms, we had a mountain view suite which was second to none.
On arrival, prior to check in we had lunch in the lounge - fish & chips, the fish was cold & when we complained we received no apology but just to be told our comments would be communicated to the chef . Also this same waitress was very rude & slow with our ongoing service.
However, I must state the service at breakfast next morning by a young waiter was exemplary, even if breakfast itself was standard buffet fare which included cold serving plates (certainly not the calibre of a 5 star establishment).
Also, the lounge bar was not open to residents after 11pm but setup for breakfast instead & the only available bar was McGills pub which was in no way comfortable & played paddywhackery music over the stereo. As a result retired to our suite earlier than itended.",1,2010,09,01
217,Annie Annie Annie,"My family and I visited Dublin and we loved it.  We did not have the pleasure of staying at
the Ritz Powerscourt as they did not have rooms available for all the nights we needed. 
We stayed at a five star hotel in the city which also had a great review on trip advisor but
not nearly the five star service we expected.  We did however visit the Ritz Powerscourt and dined at the Sugar Loaf Lounge.  There we met Annie (I hope I have her name correct).  A true gem.  I'm not sure of Annie's job title, because she seemed to do everything from hostess to waitress to concierge.  She was one of those rare people
that just makes everything special.  From our lunch, to helping us get back to our bus, to giving us informaiton and advising us of all the hotel qualities for our next trip she made our day.  Someone as special as that can completely change an opinion of a hotel or make a vacation special.  She truly is more than the Ritz Carlton Experience because it is heartfelt and sincere.  The Ritz Carlton should take advantage of this wonderful gem and utilize her in another capacity.  I am from the south and was raised with true southern hospitality and all that that implies.  Annie has all that and more.",4,2010,08,30
217,Great hotel but not convenient!,"The hotel is set in a beautiful venue.  The hotel itself is built into the side of a small hill.The rooms were huge; at least 500 sqare feet.  The bathroom was marble with a separate commode and shower.  It had a large soaking tub, 2 sinks and a TV in the mirror.  The amenties were excellent.  If you enjoy biking, walking, jogging or other outside activities this is the place to be.  
When we booked the hotel, we were under the impression that it was about 30 minutes outside of Dublin.  That might be correct but if you want to get to the center of Dublin, taking a train in was about a 1.5 to 2 hour trip.
We had a rental car to go to other parts of the country but the roads are very narrow and difficult to navigate.
We arrived about 9AM and were able to check in immediately which was great.
The resturants at the hotel are pricey.  We did eat at the Gordon Ramsey resturant and it was fabulous.
We wished the hotel was in Dublin and then it would be perfect.",4,2010,08,28
217,Fantastic - nothing too much trouble,"If you can - just stay here.  The staff are great but not over the top attentive.  The setting is stunning, the views from the spa relaxation area and the lounge just make you want to stay staring through the window all day.  The rooms are state of the art and pristine.  I have stayed in many amazing hotels and enjoyed great service etc but the number that I would definitely return to are on the fingers of one hand - this is one of them! (Gleneagles, The Berkley and Le Manoir are amongst the others)  They are great with kids and don't make you feel in anyway unwelcome in any area, the kids club is great too.  I only managed to get to the spa the day before i left - to my regret - it was sublime, probably my best massage ever.  My husband also really enjoyed the golf!",5,2010,08,23
217,This hotel is magnificent,"Everything about this hotel is excellent. From the check-in staff to the rooms, food and facilities it is definitley five star.",5,2010,08,23
217,You Go Ritz!,"Much has already been written about this hotel and while we tend to stay at smaller boutique and unfussy hotels, it was a treat to stay at the Ritz Carlton Powerscourt.  We were a group of 5 friends and relatives; the Ritz was included in the package we booked through Sceptre Tours along with airfare and 2 rental cars. 
  
It’s a newer property located about a 45 minute drive from Dublin or a 30 minutes using the DART train station located about a 15 minute drive in the seaside village of Bray, very easy to find and we never waited more then 15 minutes for the next train. You don’t want to drive in Dublin!

The Ritz is in Co Wicklow which is referred to as the garden of Ireland and it truly is. Lush landscape greets you as you pull into a long winding private drive that passes the Powerscourt golf course and leads to the must see Powerscourt Gardens and Waterfall which is very majestic and we where told is the highest fall in Ireland.  The Gardens are not more then a 5 minute drive or grab a complimentary bike from the Ritz for a 15 minute bike ride.  Once at the gardens and paying a small fee we choose the 60 minute garden walking route which we finished in less then 45 minutes, the Powerscourt mansion is filled with gift shops and there is a terrace café for light meals. The waterfall is not on the same property but I guess not more then a 4/5 mile drive down the road, a small fee to enter again and 30 to 60 minutes is more then enough time to snap some pictures and enjoy the park setting with the falls, there are restroom facilities and a snack bar for ice cream and beverages. 

So back to the hotel, the 1 bedroom suites are very elegant with 2 large flat screen TV’s, one in the bedroom and in the living room. The bed was very comfortable with double feather pillows and feather duvet. Several small touch screens are mounted on the walls and near the bed that control just about everything – TV, temperature, lighting, maid service and draperies… very Las Vegas! The large bath looked like a marble quarry, large soaking tub, separate shower with rain head, and another flat screen TV mounted behind the double vanity mirror. 

Two in our group used the ESPA for facials and massage services and said it was wonderful, relaxing and offered in a beautiful surrounding.  The Spa treatments were pricy but they always are in any hotel spa, the workout room offered more pieces of equipment then any hotel I have been in and the indoor pool is was wonderful. 

We can’t comment of the food service in the 2 hotel restaurants since we choose to dine in the small surrounding villages or Dublin.  We heard from another guest that the Gordon Ramsay restaurant was excellent.  Do go into the quaint village of Enniskerry, a 5 minute drive from the hotel, here you will find several restaurants and a small grocery store and a few shops.  We ate breakfast several times at Poppies and had a dinner at Emilia’s an Italian restaurant and Nancy Murphys a pub with outdoor seating in the back and live music. All were good and reasonable priced but as we confirmed Ireland is not a culinary capital. 

If you have any questions hit me back soon while it’s all fresh in my mind.",5,2010,08,12
217,A Lovely Countryside Retreat in Rural Ireland,"LOCATION - Ritz Carlton Powerscourt is a lovely countryside retreat in rural Ireland, about 45 minutes south of Dublin.  The nearest village is Enniskerry, which is within walking distance (they also have a free shuttle to take you or you can borrow bikes) - probably 2 minutes by car or a 15 minute walk.  Only about 4 km down the road is the seaside town of Bray, which isn't too exciting, but somewhere a bit bigger with some rides for the kids on the promenade.  The best way into Dublin is by train - the train station is about 10 minutes away - but don't stay here if touring Dublin is your main objective, it's ok for one day to go in but not more.  A rental car is quite helpful to tour the countryside, but not critical.

ROOMS - There are supposedly only three kinds of rooms - deluxe rooms, garden view suites, and mountain view suites.  However, there are secretly different levels of all of them.  Some rooms have balconies, some don't.  Some rooms  are actually junior suites without a separate room, others are a full two rooms.  Some have kitchens, some don't.  Make very sure you request what you want.  The third and sixth floor rooms have balconies and are very light and bright due to a huge balcony window.  The other rooms are much darker with much smaller windows.  Garden view rooms are not overlooking the nice grounds you see on the website - those are the mountain view rooms.  Garden view overlooks a tiny garden about six steps to walk across, with a huge retaining wall on the other side and parking lot beyond (so really parking lot view, not garden view, particularly if you're on a high floor).  We initially were given a junior suite which was not as big as advertised, but we asked to be switched out and they obliged.  

The first room we were in seemed recently refurbished, it was really spotless, great comfortable bed, very nice bathroom, large flat screen tv that tilts out so you can watch it in bed.  Huge balcony with chairs and tables, but not so nice to sit out with the garden view as it is with the mountain view.  We switched rooms to a mountain view which was way nicer for it's view and now we could sit out on the balcony and have breakfast and it seemed so serene.  We saw deer running through the grounds as we had our morning coffee.  However, the room (although 2 rooms now and bigger) was a bit worn down - the floor was all scuffed up, and the bed was rock hard and you could feel the springs.  Not what I'd expect from the Ritz, so we commented to the staff.  When we returned we had a new featherbed, and it was still a bad mattress, but much more bearable now.
Your experience at this hotel will depend on you asking for what you want, and making requests for the type of room and location you want.

The bathrooms of both rooms were very nice with tropical rain showers, though the showers were slightly clogged and didn't quite spray right.  Double sinks, marble, very nice.  Separate bathtub and shower.  There is a desk with two chairs which was great.  The toiletries were unusually cheap for a top hotel, that was a bit disappointing.  The rooms are very good size, over 700 square feet, and the closet space is massive which is nice. There is an iron and ironing board in the room, and 2 televisions if you have a full suite, though there is rarely anything to watch - half the channels are news, and the other half are strange.

SERVICE -  The service is what made our stay great at this hotel.  The staff catered to our every whim, and really tried to ensure we had a great stay.  Housekeeping fell down a couple of times (dirty glasses left in our room, for example), but we felt pampered and well taken care of.  The only thing that I was suprised about was that there was no doorman, which most Ritz properties have.

BUSINESS - There is free wi-fi throughout the hotel, which is great, however it is very slow at about 100 Kb/Sec.  You will not be watching any YouTube, Videoconferencing or sharing files with this internet service.  However, it worked fine for email.  A bit frustrating for web surfing, but workable.  There is a single computer downstairs you can use at a charge.  Conference rooms of course are a given.  That is a large portion of the clientele of the hotel.  There is a large desk with two chairs in each room.  They charge you for printing at the little computer downstairs, but they offered to print it for me if I emailed it to them.

AMENITIES - The spa is beautiful, so is the pool.  Bring your swimsuit.  The fitness room is excellent with tvs built into the equipment.  You can borrow bikes to ride around, and there is a massive lawn chess board outside and a game area.  Massages cost $215 for one hour.  There is free parking onsite.

RESTAURANTS - The best restaurant turned out to be McGills Pub which had a limited menu and pub food, but it was very tasty.  Gordon Ramsay's was a real disappointment.  Very expensive but not very good.  The service there was excellent though, it was just the food that was unimpressive.  The Sugarloaf Lounge upstairs was also not great, pretty ordinary food at high prices.  Nothing stood out.  Luckily Enniskerry is close - The Bistro there is pretty good, other places are just average but at least you get a variety.  Not much else around for fine dining.  Johnnie Fox's is about a 10 minute taxi ride - cost about 18 Euros each way.  We had breakfast included in our room price - to order it separately is about 30 Euros each.  Food here is really expensive but huge.

ENNISKERRY - This tiny village is about two blocks big, but in the middle is a square so there are more things there than you'd think.  Two pubs, three lunch places, two other dinner restaurants, a wine shop, a bakery, a food store, a mini-mart, and a pharmacy. There is a gas station a bit out of town up the hill.

ATTRACTIONS - Right next door to the hotel is Powerscourt Gardens which are worth a visit - try to go early before the tour buses arrive though.  The restaurant there that sounds nice on the website is actually a cafeteria with huge lines. Take a picnic out to the river, or a bike ride around the area.  Visit the waterfall which isn't all that exciting really, but ok for a few minutes if you're out with the car.  The beach is about 5 minutes down the road in Bray, but not really a whole lot else around.  Come here mostly if you want to relax and get away from it all.",5,2010,08,11
217,exceeded my expectations,"Have just returned from a fantastic day and night in the RC.We're local to the area and were staying to celebrate a special occasion. Having stayed previously I had high expectations and they were definitely delivered upon with just one or two things could do with improvement:

Pros:
Very well appointed room- Mountain View suite on 6th Floor- The view is incredible and very special
Gordon Ramsey Restaurant- Having read some very mixed reviews on this website I wasn't sure what to expect. The meal we had was fantastic! The food was very innovative, beautifully presented and full of flavour. However- it it expensive I would reccommend Chapter One in the City Centre as the place to go for that one very special meal. This is however quite some distance from the hotel so GR definitely is a very good alternative.
Attention to detail: The staff can't do enough and are very good at their jobs. We were given a complimentary desert with "" congratulations"" written on the plate which was a lovely surprise
River Walk: A nice amble on private land beside the hotel. If you have transport though I would reccommend Devils Glen, about a 40 minute drive away near Ashford. It's a similar walk with a dramatic waterfall at the end.

Cons
Room  was not ready until 4.30 pm...90 mins after check-in. 
Not all Mountain View suites are equal.....make sure you book one with a terrace. I did ,and the room we were given first did not have one. This was rectified after a little discussion
Hidden Costs: Steam Room and Sauna are only available if you are booked into the Spa or pay €25; breakfast-  buffet for B&B rate, a la carte ( eg. pancakes) are extra

Overall it was a fantastic night away- beautiful hotel, amazing location, great experience.",4,2010,08,08
217,A serene retreat,"My husband and I took a trip to Ireland for our 35th anniversary.  We got a great deal through Septre Tours and were a little bit leary because it was such a great deal.  Both of us agree it was the best trip we've ever had.  From the flight to the accomodations to the country itself everything was superb.  The only problem we had was the trip wasn't long enough!  The Ritz Carlton was beatiful nestled in a semi-wooded area with 10 different shades of green surrounding you.  The room was beautiful, large, spotless, and comfortable.  I've discovered sometimes in the past when you get a discounted room you get a room with an obstructed view or next to a water closet or something, but not here.  The room was great.  The grounds made you feel like you were on a retreat, quiet, well groomed and secluded.  Even though the hotel is quite large we always felt like we had our privacy.  Most of all the service and the staff were superb.  Always available to help with the smallest request.  The concierge was excellent, helpful and gave great advice.  We loved every minute of our trip and especially the people of Ireland.  Oh, the little town of Eniskerry looks like something off a postcard and again every encounter we had in town was nothing but pleasant.  Would definately go back again and have already reccommended this hotel and trip to many friends.",5,2010,07,28
217,Go on...you deserve it!,"This place is not quite somewhere I would stay regularly but it is definitely worth considering if you feel like a treat or its a special occasion.

The hotel, its rooms, staff and facilities are top class. Add the breathtaking beauty of the scenery and grounds and the fact that you are 10 minutes from the motorway network/20 minutes from Dublin and you've got a combination that deserves some serious consideration.",5,2010,07,27
217,Very family friendly!!!,"This was our second visit to the Ritz in Wicklow and again we had a lovely 5night stay.
We booked a mountain view suite with balcony and we where happy with our suite.  ( An upgrade to the next suite up would have been nice though)

Parents with young children will not be disapointed as this hotel is VERY family friendly. For the children there is nothing too much that this Ritz cannot assist with!

We travelled with a 1yr old a 3yr old and an 8yr old. For heating food a microwave arrived promptly in our room!! Great for heating bottles/baby food etc.! The kids got cookies upon arrival, though if my mind serves me rightly I do believe my kids got cookies and smoothies on a complementary basis every day on our last stay! I did also notice some other toddlers in the hotel with mini robes and slippers..... we did not get that :(

The kids playroom is super and was well packed with things to do!

I agree the food in the hotel is too pricey, McGills bar serves the best food in hotel.
I also agree with a previous comment, the toiletries are very poor these days!!! The previous time we had a much more classy product which smelt beautiful! (recession bites)

Special thanks to Pedro (front of house) in Enniskerry til January 2011! If you meet him say hi!!! He is a super friendly guy and has a lovely way with himself.

All in all unless someone tells me I believe this is one of the finest hotels Ireland has to offer. The staff and people of Wicklow are very helpful and friendly! You will surely enjoy your stay!!!",4,2010,07,17
217,First time in a Ritz-Carlton - not as swanky as I expected,"This was my first time staying in a RC, and I really had high expectations since it is a 5 star brand.  However, I did not feel that this location was a 5 star hotel (although they charged 5 star prices).

Room 455 - beautifully appointed, comfortable bed, large bathroom.  A major highlight was the radiant heating in the bathroom floor.  Very nice to exit the shower and still be on a warm floor!  Cons: weird U-shape design to the room means closets are far from the bathroom or dressing areas.  We were told the room was ""garden view,"" but it was really at the end of the hotel facing a large concrete wall and some trees.  Not at all attractive.  We weren't planning to spend a lot of time hanging out in the room, so we didn't complain.  The TV in the sleeping area was positioned in a way that made it extremely difficult to watch it from the bed.  

Food - way overpriced.  Restaurants in town are not that far, are of good quality, and cost less than half what you pay at the RC.

Service - check in was quick and smooth, free transport to Enniskerry is a wonderful amenity, and all of the staff were very friendly.  My only comment in this area is that the introductory ""tour"" of the room went on a little too long as all I wanted to do was sleep upon arrival.  

Pool and Fitness Center - Fitness center is beautiful and well-equipped.  Fruit and water are provided free of charge in that area.  The pool is beautiful, but it closed an hour earlier than indicated in the book located in our hotel room.  

Overall, we had excellent service and a beautiful hotel.  

However, I kept feeling that we were missing out on some things that make a Ritz-Carlton special (and worthy of 5 stars).  The toiletries were standard to any 2 star hotel, there was nothing special about the type or quality.  The room was sparsely appointed with many bare shelves. The bathrobes were very flimsy (I have much more luxurious ones at home), and towels were not plentiful. I felt that I could have been staying at my standard 3 star hotel and receiving much better value.",4,2010,07,14
217,Great experience,"My daughter and I took the Ritz/Sceptre package to celebrate her graduation from college and admission to law school. The Ritz was everything it was advertised to be. We opted for an upgrade to a suite, and we were not disappointed. We had plenty of room to spread out, with a living room to sit in and two double beds in the bedroom. The bathroom was very spacious, and a nice surprise came with the LARGE closet/dressing area. The staff was unobtrusive, but they were very helpful when you asked for assistance. My daughter and I opted for a spa package on the afternoon we arrived, and spent a fabulous 4 hours in the spa. The area surrounding the hotel is stunning, and the tiny village of Ennniskerry was a pleasant place for breakfast at Poppies or the coffee shop across the square. The garden tour at Powerscourt is a MUST.

Several pieces of advice:
1. If you rent a car, get the CDW...it was shocking to me what aggressive drivers there were in this genial, kind country. I lost a bumper parked by the side of the road, and I did not have any additional costs when I returned the car. Dan Dooley even offered to pay me back for the flat tire repair we encountered and said the most important thing was that no one was hurt!
2. Don’t be afraid to rent a car. It is not that hard to learn to drive on the left side of the road, and some of the best times we had were in the small villages and setting our own pace through the Ring of Kerry. Just remember that the driver is center…that is the advice that Dan Dooley gave me. Don’t be afraid to ask questions...everyone was patient and helpful…from the policeman to the shopkeepers.
3. Ask for a tax form for any purchase you make. Some merchants offer to fill out one, and some merchants wait for you to ask.
4. Even though Ireland is small by American size comparison, don’t overestimate how much you can see and do in one day. Remember the roads are narrow unless you are driving on one of the “M” roads (motorways). We left the Ritz at 8 A.M. and drove to Kilkenny, ate, shopped, drove to and toured the Rock of Cashel, and got back to the Ritz at 10 P.M., which meant it was still daylight in June. It was a long day, and we decided to sleep in the next morning and do afternoon things. Two days later we took the M7 toward Killarney and did the Ring of Kerry. We just didn’t have time to do the Cliffs of Moher or the Aran Islands, both of which were recommended. We had to make choices.
5. Take the DART into Dublin. Catch it at Bray (a 10 minute drive from the Ritz). Pay to park your car in front of the station (2 Euro) and catch the train (5 euro). We got off at Pearse station and had easy access to Grafton Street, Christi Church, and Trinity College. There is no parking in Dublin, and if you can find it, you will pay dearly for it.",5,2010,07,07
217,ABSOLUTELY FABULOUS!!!,"The Ritz was amazing, beautiful and so much fun!
However, all of the positives could have been over-shadowed by an inconsiderate staff--
needless to say, the staff was GREAT!!
They were extremely kind and helpful, making our vacation memorable in a good way!
Robbie the concierge was the best, helped arrange tours and definitely gave great instructions on taking the bus/train to Dublin.
It was a super trip, one I would love to take again.

(I WIOULD skip the restaurant -- very $$$, and we were not happy with our food.",5,2010,07,06
217,Great hard product ....,"We entered through the main gate of the estate and told the ticket booth man we were bound for the hotel. It is a quite a way along the beautiful drive before the left turn down to the hotel itself. The convex front facade of the hotel is not as imposing as the concave garden side seen on the website photographs, and the approach is dominated by car parks. Not immediately obvious between these is a pretty secret sunken garden (used for weddings / receptions I imagine) and a few labyrinths drawn around the harp water feature opposite the entrance. 

The lobby is spacious and attractive. We were lucky enough to be upgraded to a garden view suite with its own huge balcony with loungers over the garden, very well appointed, the electronic room controls which were easy to master. There were three TVs including one in the bathroom mirror. The two double beds were not particularly wide. The sofa had a severe outbreak of cushions. The view looked out onto a fountain, some nice metal sculptures, a giant crashed paper aeroplane, a croquet lawn and a giant chess set. Sadly the chess set had several of its pieces missing.

Breakfast was a large hot and cold buffet with additional served items available. Two disappointments: tough bacon, and a tendency for the serving dishes to be allowed to empty towards the end of breakfast time. But there was an extensive variety of cereals, fruits, pastries, cheeses, hams, and delightful little parfaits, and we ate well.

Food in the evening in the lounge was expensive, even for Dublin, and in this case the quality did not really justify the price: the food was good but not special, and this lack of a wow factor, together with the apparent low turnout in Gordon Ramsey's restaurant that night, put us off trying said gentleman's establishment the next night. Instead we tried McGills Bar in the hotel. Yes, it is fake, but enough care has been taken over the the decor that it had a good ambience. Apparently sometimes there is real Irish trad music; just  a CD when we were there, but well chosen. Food here was again expensive, good, but not wowee. Guinness was €4.95 a pint: a relative bargain!

Powerscourt House Gardens (admission extra) are stunning. The Ritz-Carlton also has access to a private section of the grounds along the river: access available through the concierge. Some lovely picnic spots here. 

The spa pool is dark dark dark: think swimming-by-moonlight with phosphorescence in the water. I prefer bright spas but this had its own positive qualities and was very restful. Children only allowed between 10am-6pm.

There was free Wifi throughout the hotel (hooray!) but clearly throttled to a really slow speed (about 120 kbps) so that it was ok for email but poor for anything else.

Service from the staff was very good, but having just come from a couple of Four Seasons Hotels it was interesting that there was a noticeable quality difference: not quite as enthusiastic / drilled.

This resort has a lot to recommend it, though there were some issues as mentioned above.",4,2010,07,06
217,Best hotel ever!,"Hubby & I recently spent 6 nights here, and it was heaven! The staff were wonderful--always greeted us by name. The facilities are top-rate. We did not use the spa but did checkout the workout facilities one evening. Dinner in Gordan Ramsay's was sensational! The hotel setting, nestled in the Powerscourt Estate, is nothing short of magnificient. We enjoyed the state-of-the-art technology in the rooms--TVs and room controls. We appreciated the Italian & French tv stations (I could watch Rai in the bath in the morning while hubby watched French news in bedroom). All room amenities were superior. The room was beautiful and spacious -- and the view! Sugar Loaf Mountain was right out our balcony! 
It is a 40 min. bus ride south of Dublin. The bus is easy to catch in Enniskerry, and the bus runs frequently. Nearest train station is in Bray. Make no mistake--this is not in Dublin.
The village of Enniskerry has several restaurants (2 open for breakfast) and is about a 20 min. walk (it's uphill for the return walk). There is street parking in town.
In all, I could have stayed another week! I highly recommend the Ritz-Carlton Powerscourt!",5,2010,07,06
217,Wonderful,"I recently stayed in the Ritz Carlton Powerscourt to attend a wedding. The hotel itself is situated in the most spectacular setting, in the shadow of the Sugarloaf mountain, The grounds and surrounding areas are magical, with long walks and golf on your doorstep. The hotel was without fault, and it is very rare that you can say that nowadays. The staff were polite, courteous and helpful. The rooms were very spacious, with separate dressing rooms, beautifully fitted bathrooms which included TV, and state of the art electronics for everything in the room. Our rooms had double doors to a garden area, a must in the fine weather! and wonderful for sitting out for morning coffee. I am staying in July in the Ritz in Sarasota and Naples in Florida, and am really looking forward to it, as I know now what to expect.  Keep up the good work!",5,2010,07,05
217,Breathtaking location,"Booked a Mountain view Suite @ €350 B&B. Suite was huge , fabulous decor and beautiful view. Bed and pillows a little soft for our taste. Had spa treatments, Infinity Brightening Facial And Aromatherapy massage. These were expensive but were absolute top quality and spa staff were excellent. Had pints in McGills the ""Irish "" bar , a bit twee but good Guinness! Dinner in Gordon Ramsays was excellent! Three courses, coffee and a bottle of wine , with lots of tasters in between, all for €205. Fresh local produce including the fish and cheese. Everything made fresh and from scratch, service was good, couple of little hitches, dripping red wine on tablecloth and knocking grapes from cheeseboard onto floor, but overall very professional, friendly and attentive. Breakfast served in same restaurant was lovely, beautifully cooked eggs etc. It's not a vulgar American style All You Can Eat , but 
very tasteful and fresh. Had a great walk around Powerscourt Gardens afterwards , all in all excellent.",5,2010,07,04
217,"Hotel was nice, but overpriced.  Gordon Ramsay Restaurant was a disaster - avoid at all cause!","overall the hotel and facilities were nice.  it was a bit overpriced for what you get.  The pool and spa were very nice.  However the spa services charges were by far the most we've ever paid and the experience did not come close to the price.  I have always been a fan of Gordon Ramsay so we were very excited about eating at his restaurant.  But i must say it was the biggest dining experience shortfall i've ever had.  The food and service were awful and by far the worst we had in 2 1/2 weeks in Ireland.  There were only 6 tables of guests in the restaurant and everyone was very upset with the whole event.  It took almost 2 hours to get entrees and the food was subpar...my wife sent her's back and did not receive a replacement.  They ended up comping over half our bill and from what i understand they did the same for all the tables.  The staff also told us that Gordon has only been to the restaurant twice in three years, so is it a joke that it bares his name?  I believe so!  Don't fall for the hoax and avoid this joke of a place at all cost.",3,2010,06,30
217,Good facilities but...,"Stayed for our wedding anniversary for one night in this hotel. The area around here is beautiful especially the gardens and the Village of Enniskerry. The hotel is beautiful and the facilities are great. I can highly recommend the Spa it is outstanding. The room was great and of a large size. The let down was the Gordon Ramsey restaurant. The food here is decidedly average and our Menu Surprise was not what I would have expected. My main course of Pork was inedible, and I sent it back. I can eat most everything but raw pork is not one of them. Breakfast on the Sunday morning was not great, poor quality and not enough out. We were lucky as others had to queue for some time to get a seat! They really do need a manager to take control in this but whether that happens or not is another thing. Still enjoyed it but it could have been a lot better given the price.",4,2010,06,28
217,"Gorgeous grounds, bedrooms and bathrooms.","The grounds and entrance in general to this hotel are spectacular.  From the beautiful horses in the fields, to tall, majestic trees, this is a remarkable property.  Our bedroom and sitting room were sumptuous.  Both were large and well appointed.  The gym was excellent and the public rooms were beautiful.  They also have an authentic-looking and fun pub in the basement.  My wife said that the spa treatments were exceptional.

I thought the golf courses were nice but I would always prefer to play the links courses than the parkland courses.  Where the hotel breaks down is in the treatment and programs for kids.  Stupidly, they only keep the game room open on the weekend.  They purport to be child friendly but have no programs for them.  We tried to take them to play golf and no one under 12 was allowed on the course.  Same with the workout facilities.  We found the personnel rigid towards the kids in comparison to the Four Seasons which simply found fun alternatives for children.

The concierge staff were excellent, extremely helpful and innovative.

We loved it and will be back.",5,2010,06,28
217,"Fantastic hotel, wonderful staff, beautiful town, but horrible restaurant.","The Ritz was truly a lovely hotel with helpful staff and lovely grounds.  Every aspect of the area was wonderful with the exception of Gordon Ramsey's restaurant which served pretty, mediocre, food at dear prices.  The Turbot I was served smelled like yesterday's fish and was truly poor in flavor though pretty in presentation.  When asked how the meal was I expressed my dissatisfaction which was evidenced by the fact that the meal was largely uneaten and was apologized to but was not offered a refund, or a complimentary desert , coffee, drink, etc.  We found the teasers from the chef to be mediocre to poor as well.  Good thing the rest of the trip was so outstanding that a really poor, expensive meal on the last day couldn't overshadow the good experience that the Ritz offers.",4,2010,06,22
217,Enjoyable but could be better,"We stayed two nights at the Ritz Carlton Powerscourt and visited the gardens of Powerscourt House, the waterfall and Glendalough. We dined the first night in Johnny Fox's pub(20 mins) and the second night in the Chop House, Shelbourne Road, Dublin (45 mins).

The hotel was set in lovely surroundings was modern but was a bit severe in appearance. The room was adequate but lacked a kettle and tea making facilities.

The breakfast was a buffet breakfast and again was adequate nothing exceptional.

The staff were helpful and friendly.",4,2010,06,22
217,Deluxe hotel and grounds; pity about the guests,"My wife and I decided to spend the Easter weekend at the Ritz Carlton, looking for a relaxing getaway including spa, hiking and biking. The hotel spa, grounds and cuisine were all excellent, and the service of a high quality. What was most disappointing was the behaviour of other guests. Families would come down for breakfast and dinner in their pyjamas, talk loudly and crassly, and generally behave poorly: certainly not in line with what we would expect at a Ritz Carlton. The unfortunate aspect was that staff of the hotel and restaurants did not try and control the guests or request a degree of decorum from them. 

I would think twice about going back if this is the calibre of guest that the hotel attracts.",3,2010,06,19
217,heaven,This hotel is only heaven.Everyone should try to take a night away and stay at the Ritz.. We had a basic room and it was so comfortable and took all your worries away.  I never listen  read or write comments normally but I just have to tell people about this hotel.  In May we went back to the hotel for a day in the spa and all I can say is oh my goodness.  find a way to treat yourself.,5,2010,06,18
217,My parents loved it,"My parents went to Ireland for a business trip with Motorola and they absolutely loved it.  Ross Common was absolutely beautiful and everything else they enjoyed.  Next year's trip is to Mexico and my Mom highly doubts she will win.  That's no ""winning"" attitude.",5,2010,06,17
217,"Lavish, but disappointing","We had booked two nights here on a deal through Auctionair which kept the overall B&B rate within reason, as otherwise this is a very expensive hotel.  The room we had was on the second floor with no view - the reception area is on the fourth floor, and it took a while to get used to the unusual arrangement of the floors, but this is a natural consequence of the hotel being perched on a steep hillside.  The location is stunning - a magnificent view from the back of the hotel across a lush valley to the Sugar Loaf Mountain.  The building itself is a vast modern pastiche of French Renaissance style and makes good use of the possibilities of its sloping site.

Our room was huge, and even had a small dressing room area off it, opposite the bathroom.  But the space was not well planned, and was rather lacking in seating, apart from a desk with chair and a solitary armchair.  No free internet access, and astonishingly no kettle or other tea/coffee making facility.  This was inexcusable, especially as tea or coffee via room service would have cost €6 per person plus an additional €5 service charge, but this typified the general extortionate pricing of the place.  Control of the lighting was meant to be achieved by two strange touch-screen devices, one in a drawer of one of the bedside tables, the other beside the main door.  The instruction sheet that came with this showed several icons not on the screens, which in turn had icons not on the instruction sheet.  The screens were dreadfully slow to wake up when touched, and the icons very slow to do anything, and indeed sometimes nothing at all would happen.  After considerable experimentation we learned how to open & close the curtains with this system, and to plunge the room into darkness - there seemed to be no way to turn the bedside lights on and off individually, and the lights were so dim anyway that reading in bed was out of the question.  What is wrong with conventional light switches?  I do hope when the hotel gets refurbished that these dreadful touch-screens get ripped out and proper switches installed in their place.   Poor choice of channels on the large flat screen TV.

The bathroom was a reasonable size, with a good walk-in shower cubicle, a separate toilet with a glass door, and side by side washbasins.  Both of these basins were very slow to drain.  There's a small TV screen set into the bathroom mirror, which was a fun gimmick, but it had an alarming tendency to switch itself on without warning!

There are three places to eat within the hotel: Gordon Ramsay's restaurant (which was also where breakfast gets served); the Sugar Loaf Lounge, which has light meals throughout the day; and McGills Bar which is tucked away in a rather gloomy corner at the start of the extensive wing of function suites.  The prices at Gordon Ramsay's were so hefty we didn't bother with it, and tried the Sugar Loaf Lounge instead.  Limited choice and still pretty pricey, and disappointing quality.  So on our second night we tried McGills Bar which was a reasonable facsimile of a genuine pub, and had a good choice of fairly traditional plain bar meals.  Still expensive, but certainly the best value of the three outlets, and the food was good of its kind.  Breakfasts were disappointing - a poor cold buffet of under-ripe sliced fruits; a limited range of cereals, and a particularly poor choice of cooked foods kept lukewarm in chafing dishes: greasy hash browns; rubbery scrambled egg; two sorts of bacon; rather odd-tasting sausages; tiny flavourless button mushrooms; grilled tomatoes; and very dry black & white pudding slices.  No other choice of egg; no Irish potato bread; no baked beans.  Nor were there any fish dishes such as kippers or poached haddock. The cold dishes included a limited selection of cold meats and cheeses.

The hotel pool was a reasonable size - 20 metres, and a proper depth and rectangular shape for swimming, unlike the very odd shaped and useless pools so many other hotels favour.  But oh so gloomy - black tiles and silly little LEDS on the bottom making seeing where you're swimming a bit haphazard.  A very good hot spa pool as well, and plenty of loungers around the pool; smart and spacious changing facilities.  There are also ESPA massages and other treatments available at truly extortionate prices.  I once tried an ESPA aromatherapy massage at another hotel where the prices were only about 50% more than a proper aromatherapist, and was disappointed by the quality - here the prices were at least 3X the normal rate, so refusal was an easy decision!

There are nice gardens and some interesting modern sculptures in the grounds, but they don't make it easy for you to find your way out there - I had to ask, and later found that the quickest and best way was out through the glass doors of the fitness room.

Service throughout was superb; friendly and efficient, though food delivery could be rather slow.  The excellent Polish barman in McGills Bar said they had 34 different nationalities working in the hotel, so there are a variety of accents to be heard, but all speak excellent English and are all first class.

My 'yes' to recommending it to others must be qualified by warning that it does have its flaws, and that it is VERY expensive - as a one-off two night stop we enjoyed it, but we wouldn't bother returning.  It is also too far out of Dublin to be considered a base for sight-seeing there; it is more a relaxing destination in its own right.  Golfers no doubt will be happy as it is right beside a golf course, and there are also the grounds of the original Powerscourt House to explore (at more cost!).",4,2010,06,08
217,AMAZING ANNIVERSARY...,"My Husband and I celebrated our 1st Anniversary for three nights in a Mountain View Suite, the room was out of this world - pure luxury.     The staff were friendly and could not do enough for you.     Enniskerry village is a 10 min walk and the hotel offers a complimentary car to and from the village.    We had a beautiful meal in Emilias Ristorante in Enniskerry, well worth a visit 2 Starters, 2 Mains, bottle of house white 53 Euro.     On Sunday night we dined in Gordon Ramsey at Powerscourt, this was expensive but well worth it - 205 Euro for 2 Starters, 2 Mains and bottle of wine, however with all the extra courses we received and treats we ended up with a 8 course meal! The staff made a real effort to make our anniv. special by scattering rose petals on the bed for our return to our suite and also sending us a card.    I would return in a heart beat - if you can visit this outstanding hotel.",5,2010,06,07
217,Beautiful and relaxing!!,"This location was amazing!! it was hard to find at first, and we lost our way at first, but once we found it, it was easy to get to. The surrounding grounds was such a beautiful sight!!  The pool and spa facility were great! you have to at least spend 2 hours there if not more. When you return in the evenings you have to stop at the gates and ring the bell, so the gates can be opened for you. The staff were friendly and helpful. The room itself was to die for! though I wish they had more channels, and not soccer on all the time. But there was free internet & self parking. There's a bar and restaurant inside the hotel. though I have to say the menu is not extensive. But I would definitely stay there again. and it's only 20 min from Dublin.",5,2010,06,04
217,Beautiful counrtyside hotel that is a destination unto itself ... problem is the wedding parties,"PROs
- the suite was massive (c. 1000sf)  with 2 bathrooms and proper living room, dining room bedroom ... it was bigger than an apt in NYC/London/Paris
- grounds well exceptional and well maintained ... picturesque setting
- fantastic natural sites/activities within reach ... powerscourt gardens, waterfall, trails, etc
- Gordon Ramsay restaurant on site ... I am not a big GR fan, but given location this was an excellent option
- staff was helpful
- room was cleaned to a very high standard
- design was fantastic ... overall one of the best hotels I have stayed
- complete spa with everything you want onsite

CONs 
(these prevent it from being the best hotel ever, but not meant to deter ... i really cannot unerstand the bad reviews)
- due to all of the positives above, this place is ideal setting for weddings ... which meant loud, obnoxious wedding guests take over the lobby constantly (the unruly, screaming kids were especially ""pleasant"") ... this place is just a little too family friendly
- spa was outrageously overpriced ...though I went twice anyways 
- business center was ONE ROOM and they want 5 euro for 15 minutes ... then agan, bringing laptop solves this",5,2010,06,03
217,Relaxing and Elegant - Highly Recommended,"My husband and I spent 6 nights at this truly wonderful hotel in mid-May.  We were lucky enough to get it through a Sceptre Tour package including airfare and rental car.  Therefore, I cannot comment on the value as the deal we got was incredible.  My rating is for the food and additional services only.

First and foremost the service was amazing.  Everyone was courteous, professional, and friendly...a rare combination.  When asked to move rooms we were quickly accommodated.  The concierge helped us plan every outing, maps and directions included.

Our room was beautiful.  The white marble bathroom was pure luxury.  My only complaint would be the bed - it was too soft for me and I developed a back ache.  However, I am spoiled in this regard as I sleep on a Tempur-pedic at home. My husband found the bed very comfortable.

We both enjoyed the pool and hammam.  It was incredibly easy to relax by the pool with the low lighting, calming music, and gorgeous crystal-lit water.  We both fell asleep our first day.  

The food at the hotel was quite pricey, except for the reasonably priced pints at the pub.  We tended to eat while sight-seeing or in Enniskerry, which was a beautiful 15 minute stroll from the hotel.   Our favorite restaurant by far was the Farm Kitchen (http://www.theenniskerryfarmkitchen.ie/).  It just opened when we arrived and it was so good that we ate there the last two nights of our stay.  Super friendly service, delicious and healthy food, and great atmosphere.  I highly recommend the organic beef meatballs. 

In total we had 5.5 days in Ireland which we divided up as follows:
-a half day at the hotel
-day trip to Dublin
-a day trip to Cashel/Kilkenny
-a day spent visiting the Powerscourt gardens and waterfall
-a day driving through Wicklow county/hiking in Glendalough
-a split day in Dublin/the hotel

=a relaxing yet adventurous vacation

If you can afford it or score a deal like we did, do not hesitate to stay here.",5,2010,06,02
217,Absolutely Delightful!,"My husband and I stayed at this hotel for two nights at the end of our two week trip through the UK and Ireland.  We booked a great deal that gave us a resort credit.  Upon arrival, we were greeted immediately and upgraded to a suite on the top floor corner overlooking the moutains.  There is a wonderful little pub on the bottom floor, a great tea room area overlooking the mountains, bicycles for guest use, an amazing pool in the basement with crystals all over the floor and pool and ceiling, and a great workout room.  The beds are typical of a Ritz Carlton as are the room amenities.  We particularly enjoyed the steam shower and the tv in the bathroom mirror that you could see perfectly from the huge bathtub.  The staff was very accomodating.  We didn't eat Ramsey's restaurant and chose to stick with the pub fare as we just loved it down there.  The breakfast was very good, particularly the yogurt parfaits.  Overall, it was just delightful.  As a side note, I would not stay here if I was going to want to sightsee in Dublin on more than a day.  This is more of a place where you stay to relax and unwind.",5,2010,05,23
217,Beautiful Location - Excellent Service,"Spent six nights here in a large suite, - front of building without view of mountains. The service from Staff was outstanding, friendly and  efficient.  Not a place to dine unless you have a wad of Euros - like a cup of coffee for ($) 5.00 euro, small chocolate cake dessert for  ($) 9 euro. Solved that by driving 5 minutes down to the Village and had Breakfast and Dinner there at The Bistro part of the Powerscourt Arms Country House.   The Ritz will  even drive you down and pick you up.  The grounds were magnificently landscaped,  took two driving tours throughout the mountains, all mapped out with the directions by the the Hotel Staff. As a Senior, I was not into bicycling, Spa, or pools, although my daughter used these facilities.
We really made the trip to visit Family but thought this Hotel would be interesting and comfortable which it was.  I definitely would return without hesitation. It was part of a package offered by Sceptre Tours and well worth the price.  Ritz Carlton is a well deserved 5 start Hotel.",5,2010,05,17

217,Bset Luxury Hotel in the Dublin/Wicklow area -,"Great hotel with true 5start luxury service and facilities. Not cheap, but beautiful location with views of Sugar Loaf and next to Powerscourt gardens, and waterfall.

Rooms are beautifully finished and if you can stretch to it, get a suite with a terrace during Summer months.

G Ramsay restaurant good at lunch but overpriced for dinner, lounge is more comfortable and reasonable.

Staff are outstanding, few hotels do it as well.",5,2010,05,10
217,Fantastic Stay - loved Gordon Ramsay’s restaurant!,"My husband and I booked the Ritz Carlton in a vacation package through Dan Dooley which included flight, car rental, and 6 nights at the Ritz Carlton Powerscourt.  Before proving my review of the hotel I just wanted to state that the package with Dan Dooley was a great deal and we had no issues with anything.

Now on to the hotel review...  The Ritz Carlton was AMAZING!  The staff, room, and grounds were top notch which is something I expect when staying at the Ritz.  It didn’t disappoint.  You are a 5 minute walk from Powerscourt Estate and about a 15 minute walk to the little town of Enniskerry.  Our room was huge - separate bedroom and living area, a huge closet room, and a nice size bathroom with separate shower and tub.  We absolutely loved the TV inside the mirror in the bathroom - I may need to invest in one!  

The restaurants were great as well and a little pricey but we expected that.  The pub is convenient with great fish and chips and Gordon Ramsay’s restaurant was FABULOUS.    This restaurant is a must to eat at if you are staying at the Ritz.  The staff at both restaurants were great as well.

Our favorite thing about the Ritz -- the indoor pool, hot tub, and steam room.  The steam room was the best I have ever been in.  The pool was refreshing without being cold and just gorgeous with the black tiles, swartvoski crystals and uplights.  We spent a majority of our time in that area.  Some other amenities that the Ritz offers are a 24 hour fitness room (with complimentary bottles of water and headphones), bike rentals, courtesy car that can take you to a local pub in Enniskerry (which we took advantage of and loved) and a wonderful concierge office.  Our concierge was busy because of the ash cloud situation while we were there but they were very helpful in getting us information.

We hope someday to make it back to the Ritz in Powerscourt and experience this great hotel in the Irish countryside.",5,2010,05,08
217,Poor value for money,"Comparing this hotel to the Four Seasons in Ballsbridge, it is not good value.  Rooms are spacious, service is good but it is very expensive in comparision.  The room was too hot and it was impossible to turn down the air con.  There was an offer in the spa which was excellant with great therapists.  Food was good although expensive.",3,2010,05,06
217,"Best Hotel experieince, anywhere",What can I say?  Ended up here because we were stranded by the volcano gave us a great deal on an incredible suite with a balcony and view and let our two children 6 and 10 stay in the suite with us (the Merrion in Dublin forced us to pay for two rooms for us and the kids).  Incredible service everywhere especially room service (suprisingly reasonable prices) and the concierge.  Set up a special suite for the aid of volcano stranded travellers.  I have stayed in many luxury hotels and this was the best.  Lots of great activities around.  hotel arranged horsebackriding and fishing.  Amazing pool. Cannot wait to go back.,5,2010,05,05
217,Room with a View,"We arrived at the Ritz Carlton with friends for a 6 night stay on April 23.   The volcano played havoc with our plans and it was not until the day of the flight we learned we would actually be able to go, so it was with great anticipation we boarded the plane for our first trip to Ireland.  We knew the RC was outside Dublin, and we had seen the pictures on the Internet, but when we walked into the hotel we knew we were in for a treat.  No pictures can do justice to the setting of this place and the beautiful countryside.  

The hotel is luxurious; the views breathtaking.  But all of this would not have been enough without the wonderful staff at the hotel.  We were warmly welcomed and immediately felt at ease.  Our suite (two connecting rooms with a shared living room) was immaculate with tasteful decor, comfortable beds, and spacious bathrooms.  But the best parts were the balconies, one off a bedroom and one off the living room, which afforded us views of the grounds and Sugar Loaf mountain in the distance.  Each balcony had lounges, and a table and chairs.  We spent each morning on these balconies enjoying our breakfast, and evenings there with wine and shared good company.

I have read the other reviews of the hotel, some written by guests who were there the same time as us, and I would agree with some of their comments.  If you are planning to tour Ireland, this hotel is not in the best location.  Certainly you can get into Dublin and drive to surrounding areas, but if Galway and the Ring of Kerry, for example, are part of your itinerary you might want to consider another location.  (One thing we learned is that if you ask an Irishman how long it takes to get from one point to another, you can safely double the time you were told.)  Distances were so great we actually extended our stay and left the hotel for two days to drive to the southwest, and returned for one night before flying home.    

If you choose to stay at this RC you must be sure to do two things.  One is to bring your swimsuit because you are not going to be able to resist the pool.  The second is to be sure to visit the Powerscourt Gardens which are just a short walk up the hill.   A river walk, located on the Powerscourt Estate, but not open to the general public, is also offered to hotel guests, but honestly, it was not what we expected.  The hike down to the river is steep, and although the street is paved, not difficult, but the hike back UP is exhausting.  We had expected to meander by the river, but the walk is actually a paved road with the occasional car going by.  The scenery is lovely, but we had expected something more ""rural.""  

The neighboring town of Enniskerry offers a couple of restaurant choices.  We ate at Nancy Murphy's (good food but little atmosphere) and at Poppy's which makes the most delicious scones each morning.  When we asked all the locals where we should go to find an ""authentic"" Irish pub they all said, ""Go to Johnny Fox's.""  So we did.  It's a few miles out of town up an unbelievably windy road.  If you are planning to drink, you'd best take a taxi.  We had a great lunch there but never found the time to get back for an evening.  It's impossible to describe the place.  You just have to see it for yourself.

We found our stay at the RC to be more than we expected.  We have traveled many places around the world and would rate the accommodations at this hotel among the finest.  The staff is young, enthusiastic, and well trained..  We were always greeted by name and our requests handled promptly and professionally.  I just can't think how any guest could ask for more.  Thanks to everyone at the hotel who made our stay so memorable.",5,2010,05,03
217,Fantastic Hotel.Can't wait to return!!!,"My Wife and i have just spent the most fantastic weekend at this absolutely beautiful hotel. From the moment we arrived at the elegant entrance, we were made to feel very special. We were relieved of our bags and swiftly checked in by extremely friendly staff, then escorted to our ritz-carlton suite which we were lucky enough to be staying in for our weekend stay. We were given a tour of the suite and everything explained to us extensively by our very efficient and professional member of the ritz-carlton team. We had received this suite as a prize but if anyone could afford to pay the somewhat high price required for a stay then it is pure luxury worth experiencing. €1950.00 per night though seems quite cheap compared to the €5000per night quoted for the presidential suite. We were lucky enough to get a viewing of it and it is indeed PRESIDENTIAL!! but is it worth €5000per night?????..............All relative to ones personal wealth i think.....don't think i'll ever be able to stay in it. 
Anyway, as far as i know talking to other guests, even the basic rooms are absolutely amazing and better than most higher priced luxury rooms in other hotels any where in the world. A important way of judging a hotel is by its cleanliness. There is a saying that 'Cleanliness is next to Godliness'. To this end then, you can find the Ritz-carlton powerscourt situated next to the Pearly Gates.
We did not eat in the hotel the first night as we were dining in the Gordon Ramsey restaurant on our 2nd night so we dined in the nearby village of Enniskerry at the delightful Emilias Ristorante(I have posted a seperate review on this site-please read). The hotel offer a complimentary chauffer service to and from the village as you need it which is great when a few glasses of wine are taken on board.
On the second day we availed of the facilities in the ESPA spa. What an amazing experience provided by the most friendly, professional and competent staff we have had the pleasure to meet. DO NOT pass up the opportunity to experience this.
Now unfortunately i come to the only part of our stay that i did not really enjoy. The Gordon Ramsey restaurant. Do not get me wrong, the dining room was elegant  the staff were amazingly friendly and professional. They explained every dish as it arrived, which was needed with more than one or two. Although absolutely perfect in presentation we did not find that there was anything amazing in the tastes of our dishes(although the black pudding in my scallop starter was to die for). I'm sure Gordon would tell me to F@#K OFF but, as much as a fan of his shows i am, i am afraid i found Emilias far far better for taste. 
I was informed by others that the food in the Sugar loaf restaurant was amazing, so it could be a better option for diners looking for a less theatrical dining experience. 
The beauty, oppulence, extravagance and atmosphere of this hotel is only surpassed by the fantastic staff that meet you around every corner with a smile and a willingness to assist with any request you have. Admitedly this comes at a price, but to be honest, for those of us that do not experience this kind of care and attention every day....It's worth every penny!!
THANK YOU R.C. AND ESPA for making our Wedding anniversary so memorable.",5,2010,04,27
217,"Luxury, Location, and Service","We recently returned from a several day stay at the Ritz Carlton Powerscourt, a beautiful luxury hotel and resort in the Wicklow Mountains, not far from Dublin.  The hotel is a new—maybe 2 years old—property, built on part of the Powerscourt Estate, where the famous Powerscourt Gardens are located.  The hotel is just a short walk from the Gardens. This is a scenic, bucolic setting, with views from the hotel gardens, lobby, and many lucky rooms of the lovely surrounding countryside and the striking Sugar Loaf Mountain.  We really enjoyed our huge and luxurious room. The bed was amazingly comfortable, probably the best hotel bed we have ever experienced, with wonderful sheets and pillows. The bathroom was great too, with a very soothing rain showerhead. The service at the Ritz Carlton was perfect and unusually friendly for a hotel of this caliber:  not just correct, but truly warm and eager to be of help.  Particularly noteworthy were Paul, at the front desk, Roman, in property maintenance, and Keiran, one of the concierges.  When we arrived very early, exhausted after a long flight, Paul was sympathetic and went out of his way to locate a room for us.  When we asked for an adaptor, Roman arrived with one within five minutes.  Kieran and the other concierges had bus schedules at the ready, along with clearly written driving directions for especially scenic routes to local spots such as Glendalough.  With their directions, we never needed our GPS, and never got lost.  We felt the hotel’s location was ideal for our needs.  On the days we went into Dublin, we found it easy and convenient:  we took a bus from the village of Enniskerry to the DART station at Bray, and then the DART commuter train along a scenic seaside route to the Pearse Station in Dublin.  It took exactly one hour from the time we got on the bus to our arrival in Dublin, and we never seemed to have to wait more than 15 minutes for a DART train.  However, the DART stops running before midnight, so the Ritz location won’t work well for those planning late nights in Dublin. But the location is ideal for exploring sites in Wicklow County, such as Glendalough.  It also was convenient for visiting Newgrange, north of Dublin: an easy, painless drive of about an hour using the M50 ring route, which avoids Dublin traffic altogether.  My husband enjoyed using the beautiful indoor pool, which has unusual, very relaxing lighting.  The picture-postcard village of Enniskerry is very close—less than a mile away—and has a few shops, restaurants, a pub or two and a laundrette, as well as bus connections to Dublin and Bray.  The very upscale little seaside town of Dalkey (home to Bono and Van Morrison) is just a few DART stations away; it is scenic and has great restaurants options.  My husband and I were lucky to stay at the Ritz Carlton Powerscourt as part of a value package which included car and airfare from the US.  We agreed that we would love to come back in the future, perhaps for a golf vacation at the adjacent Powerscourt golf courses, even if it means paying the full Ritz Carlton rates.",5,2010,04,27
217,Now spoiled for all other hotels...,"We stayed at the Ritz-Carlton on what was to be the last night of our honeymoon (we ended up with an extended stay in the country as our flight was canceled due to the Icelandic ash cloud).  What a joy!
The hotel itself is lovely - although the approach from the front is less than impressive, the back, with windows and balconies overlooking a breathtaking view of the Wicklow Mountains, is fantastic.  The lobby is nice, and the suite we stayed in was luxuriously simple - nothing too over the top.
Our bed was so comfortable, and the bathtub was lovely - I took a hot bath while watching a movie on the in-mirror bathroom TV set!    
The staff was extremely friendly and helpful - while other hotels were price gouging people who were stranded due to the volcano, they offered us a steeply discounted room if we decided to stay on, and also allowed us a late check out in order to make phone calls regarding our canceled flight.
We had breakfast included with the room (much better value than purchasing separately), and it was the best breakfast we'd had all week - fresh bread and pastries, all the fixtures of a ""full Irish breakfast"", delicious yogurt and fruit!  
The only downsides were (1) the location - while it says it's convenient to Dublin, it's really a bit of a trip.  Otherwise the only thing that's near is the tiny village at the bottom of the hill, which clearly caters to wealthy tourists (read: overpriced meals and drinks).  If you're looking to get away from everything, though, it's very peaceful and quiet, and the village is quaint.  The other is (2) the price of extras.  It's not much more than would be expected in a high-end hotel, but really...we spent $25 to attempt to make a phone call to our airline, and of course any food and beverage prices were crazy.  
I would stay again - it was a highlight of our trip!",5,2010,04,25
217,Disappointed,"We are currently spending our last evening at the Ritz.  Unfortunately we are not able to write a more positive review.  While the hotel is definitely beautiful and the views breathtaking, three events occured that we feel compelled to write about.  

We arrived here to celebrate our honeymoon and although the hotel was not even nearing half-capacity, when we informed the front-desk person (who I might add was quite unfriendly) nothing was offered to make our 6-night stay more enjoyable.  I should also add that I emailed the office twice previously enquiring about any additional suggestions they might recommend to make our stay more enjoyable and memorable.  One return email offered rates for overnight accomodations while the other email went ignored.

We met the concierge who quite nicely sent a strawberry and cream dessert along with a handwritten note congratulating us on our recent nuptials.  Unfortunately the cream contained a personal body hair  from the nether-regions!!!!  We found this quite disturbing as it was not inconspicious at all.

The third complaint I have is from the dinner we shared tonight.  I ordered the seafood pasta dish from the Sugarloaf Lounge.  Besides the fact that the pasta was dry and overcooked, the 'aroma' from the smoked fish was overwhelming.  Nothing was done to accomodate this despite the fact I clearly conveyed this to the wait staff.

So despite the beautiful surroundings and somewhat opulent design of the hotel and grounds, we were extremely disappointed in our honeymoon stay at the Ritz.",4,2010,04,18
217,Expensive but worth every cent!!!!,"We stayed here for weekend in late February, the hotel is fabulous, definately the best I have stayed in, the staff are excellent and very friendly, everyone said hello. We stayed in a junior suite, fabulous comfortable beds and everything was luxuriuos. Breakfast was fab, had to wait though as the hotel was very busy, didnt mind though. Food was delicious. The pool and jacuzzi were great also. If you want a weekend of luxury in a perfect hotel then definately stay here, highly recommended. Best hotel in Ireland by a mile!!!",5,2010,04,16
217,This hotel offered us everything for a perfect break for three generations.,"Clean spacious rooms with panoramic windows and electrically operated curtains. Staff really accommodating but very unobtrusive. Beds so comfortable! Requested blankets- no problem. Lovely bathroom with double sinks, separate toilet and shower cubicle . Loved the pool  and changing rooms with large private shower rooms. The location is perfect for a variety of activities. Sightseeing at nearby beauty spots, Glendalough, Avoca etc. Concierge very helpful with maps and advice.  Lovely walks in the grounds of Powerscourt and bicycles can be hired in hotel. Shopping in Dublin is only a short journey away. The hotel has lots of facilities for children. My grandchildren just wanted to stay and live there!",5,2010,04,13
217,"fantastic, beautiful","fab hotel beautiful and so comfortable,  we had booked a garden view suite but were upgraded to a mountain view suite upon arival as i was celebrating my birthday. check in was fast and very friendly. hotel also very clean which is important.  came back from a walk to find chocolates and a birthday card from hotel in our room such a nie touch and something that really sets ritz carlton hotels apart from others.  my only complaint is that the staff in the bar area can be very very slow at times taking 20 mins to take our order etc but quite pleasent atmosphere is amazing. did not eat in gordan ramsey as felt was over priced and have heard bad things. breakfast was acceptable but noting special.  will definatley be back here especially in the summer when i can imagine the setting would be truly stunning.  would absolutley recomend this hotel to anyone.",5,2010,04,10
217,Fabulous hotel - pity about the Gordon Ramsey restaurant,"I stayed there on Easter Sunday night with my husband. The room was very impressive except for the distinct lack of shower gel etc and no evening change of towels which I would expect in a 5 Star hotel. The room was spacious and clean. The staff were very friendly & helpful. We ate in the Gorden Ramsey restaurant and were persuaded to have the ""Surprise Menu"". I think the menu was probably a combination of the Starters and Main Courses that nobody else wanted.  The Goats Cheese was sour and the Norwegian Wild Salmon looked and tasted like it had been sitting on a plate for hours.  It was turned up at the edges and completely dried out. The chicken breast was just average. I am sure if Gordon Ramsey was served such a dreadful meal he would lose his reason. It was an insult to expect anyone to eat such a meal and charge Eur 75 per person for such an awful experience.
The breakfast the next day, on the other hand, was excellent . So I would strongly recommend the hotel to get rid of this restaurant before it destorys their reputation. I would recommend the hotel to a friend but NOT the restaurant.",4,2010,04,07
217,"If price is no object, an amazing property","Ritz-Carlton’s Powerscourt property recently opened its opulent doors to us common folk by offering some fairly good on-line deals in a sure sign that the Irish economy has hit the skids rather smartly.  The property itself is as awe-inspiring as any you are likely to find in Europe surrounded by what passes in Ireland as mountains with a main building that curves around the view both inside and out.  The fit and finish and shear size of the rooms are beyond reproach as are the common areas.  The service is what you would expect although we did spend a good 25-30 minutes waiting for a ride back to the hotel one night after the staff dropped us off in very nearby Enniskerry.  All of this comes at a price as one of our party, an inexperienced traveler, found out one night, an exceedingly high price.  Without checking the cost, a few items were sent down to be washed by the hotel generating a $289 bill.  There was a list of prices in a closet which should have been consulted before the order was placed but when the bill for washing clothes exceeds the obvious replacement cost of the clothes it leaves the taste of having been defrauded.  The other major issue is location.  Although there are some good attractions in County Wicklow, some within walking distance of the hotel, if your main plans include touring Dublin expect at about an hour’s train ride from a station about a 15 minute drive from the hotel (the daring or foolhardy could drive into the city of course).",3,2010,04,04
217,Spectacular resort near (but worlds away from) Dublin,"My husband and I, along with our 2 year old, stayed one week at the Ritz-Carlton Powerscourt Hotel  in March 2010 and had a fabulous time.

The hotel is an easy 45 minute drive from the Dublin airport, driving on highways until the last few miles.  We found the hotel easily using the directions on their website.  We arrived early (noon-ish), and unfortunately a room was not available.  We decided to walk around the grounds for a while until our room was ready.  The Powerscourt Estate and gold courses are just outside the hotel’s driveway, which made for a great way to spend some time.  

Note that the entrance to the hotel is shared with the estate and golf course, so has a security gate.  During the day, the gates are open -- just tell the attendant that you are staying at the hotel.  At night, you need to buzz the hotel via an intercom and ask them to open the gate.  Good for security, although the process took some time.

The front desk was efficient when we finally checked in.  Self parking is free and the lot is just steps from the main entrance.  The hotel lobby is spectacular – it features multiple wood burning fireplaces, which give off a great scent, beautiful flower arrangements, and has windows looking at the forest and Wicklow Mountains – perfect for afternoon tea or a drink on the way home from touring.  The lobby is on the 4th floor, so many rooms (including our own) were downstairs.

Our room was on the 2nd floor and faced the rear of the property.  Our view was wonderful – a fountain, woods, and part of the Wicklow Mountains in the background.  We realized upon entering that the hotel was modern, as electricity was controlled via an electronic touchpad on the wall – cool!  The room was over-sized, with plenty of room for us, our luggage, a crib, and still had walking room.  Just inside the door is a small room with a closet, safe, and room to store our luggage and stroller.  We walked down a short hallway to get to the bedroom, which was king-sized and comfortable.  The room also came with seating, a desk, dresser,  and television.  There was a balcony outside with 2 seats and a table.  

The bathroom was luxurious – we had a shower room with an overhead rain-style shower as well as a hand held device.  A large sunken tub was available as well.  The most spectacular part of the bathroom was a TV embedded inside the mirror above the double sink.  Awesome!  And the sound quality was great.  The toiletries provided were plentiful.

Wireless internet was available for FREE which is unusual at high end hotels.  We made the most of it, connecting with both a laptop and our iPhone.

We had a package deal which included breakfast, which turned out to be a good value.  The breakfast buffet was EUR 29 per person, which was pricey.  The quality and choice of food was excellent.  The buffet had lots of selection, including eggs, meat, cheese, cereal, porridge, fruit, yogurt, and breads.  Particularly notable was the prosciutto which was carved from an actual leg of meat, the Irish bread, farmhouse yogurt, and interesting fruit, including kiwi and watermelon.  The service at the restaurant was friendly, and they were very tolerant of our young son.

We also tried the pub at the hotel.  It’s hard to find (ask for directions) but the food quality was excellent and the service was quick and friendly.  The pub features a wood burning fireplace, which is suitable for lingering at tables in that area.

We visited the indoor swimming pool, which is free for guests.  Very interesting pool – the lighting comes from crystals in the floor of the pool, giving it a surreal, night-time look.  The spa also offers a hammam (kind of like a sauna).  Locker rooms are clean and spacious.  My husband went jogging in the exercise room, which overlooks the back yard of the hotel and is beautiful.   

We used the hotel as a base for day trips.  We visited Dublin twice, once by Luas (tram) and once by train.  In both cases, we had to drive ~15 or 20 minutes and found parking.  The lot at the Luas was much cheaper, although parking is more plentiful along the train line.  

We found the drive around the area to be easy, and visited Powerscourt Falls, Glendalough, and the Wicklow Mountains in a day.  We also drove to Northern Ireland to see Giant’s Causeway.  It was ~4 hrs each way from the hotel, as the roads (particularly in the last leg of the trip) went from highway to local one-lane’s.  Powerscourt Estate Gardens, right next to the hotel, were lovely and worth a long visit.  We also drove to Cashel and Cahir, about 1.5 hrs away, to see the castles.

My husband forgot his medicine at home, so the hotel referred us to the Enniskerry village doctor and pharmacy, which were just down the road from the hotel.  For an emergency visit, they were fairly priced and accepted a walk-in from the hotel on the same day.

Upon check out, the hotel gave our son a small plush lion to take home – very nice touch!
 We would absolutely stay at his hotel again if we visit the area.  Fantastic visit!!",5,2010,04,03
217,Amazing Hotel perfect for relaxing getaway,"While the weather wasn't on our side, the hotel comforts more than made up for being coupled up inside, particularly the incredible ESPA spa downstairs. Take your swimming toggles, the pool is out of this world.",5,2010,03,25
217,Want to Relax?  Loved the Ritz Carlton,"Six of us took advantage of a package through Sceptre Tours which included the flight to Dublin, car, and 6 nights at the Ritz Carlton.  The Ritz is located about 30 miles south of Dublin.  A remote but very beautiful location.  Our accommodation was two rooms, a bedroom and livingroom.  Yes, the food was expensive, but everything I ate there was delicious.  The pub is less expensive then the lounge/restaurant upstairs, and we had no interest in the Gordon Ramsey restaurant.  Only had breakfast once.  We skipped the buffet and ordered a la carte at breakfast.  They do not have ""hot pots"" in the room, but I brought an inexpensive pot to heat water and made my own coffee in the morning and tea at night (try starbucks ""via"" coffees).  If you dont' have a car, you will have to rely on a taxi to get back and forth to Dublin (40 Euro one way to Dublin) or take a taxi to the DART train to Dublin (26 Euro one way - then the DART fare).  The hotel has negotiated set rates for the taxis, so just tell the concierge where you want to go, and they will advise you of the rate.  Take time to visit the Powerscourt Estate.  Pricey entrance fee, but there are also some nice shops.  The hotel will drive you down to the village of Enniskerry where there are restaurants, a pub, grocery store, pharmacy, and an amazing antique shop called Alladin's den (or something like that).  One tour company, which takes you on a local tour of Wicklow will pick you up at the hotel (Wild Wicklow Tours).  Not to be missed it was the highlight of my trip.  Don't miss going down to the pool, and take advantage of the spa if possible.  Ask if they have any specials at the spa.    In summary, I have no complaints about the hotel and hope to go back someday (with a driver).  One member of our party, who doesn't know how to relax, was  not happy with the location - she thought it was too remote and isolated.  I, however, found it a perfect balance of being able to go into Dublin easily (4 of us would share a taxi), but at the same time, having a beautiful and relaxing location to come back to a night.",5,2010,03,12
217,Outstanding service & attention to every detail,"If you have an event you want to make extra special, the Ritz Carlton Powerscourt is the place to stay!  We were celebrating our Mother's 75th birthday and everyone at the Ritz made her feel so special from the time of arrival to departure.  For example, we had made reservations for 8 for dinner in the lobby lounge area and were blown away when they escorted us to a semi private room and brought in a glass of champagne for each of us for a birthday toast .  The service was outstanding with attention to every detail.  Even though we opted to pass on dessert they had prepared a special plate of truffels with a candle and Happy Birthday written in chocolate and brought it to our mother.  It was prepared so beautifully and was so thoughtful that it was beyond belief.  The Ritz Carlton Powerscourt is a sure bet if you want something extra special!",5,2010,03,11
217,Just as fantastic second time round!!,"Me and my girlfriend stayed here for the second time round for Valentines weekend and it was the best Valentines weekend we ever had. Usually you would expect that the second time you visit a place that you had a fantastic experience in history cannot repeat, well this was the tought in my mind and i coulden't have been more wrong. We stayed in a Mountain View Suite as we had the first time and it was even more spacious and perfectly designed then the first one. At some point in the future you are visiting the Ritz Carlton Powerscourt and you are booking a Mountain View Suite I would recommend that you ask for one on the 2nd floor and I assure you you will not be dissapointed! We ate at Gordan Ramseys for dinner on the first night and for lunch before we left and it comes highly recommended. Try the 7 course surprise menu, its pricey and is not for the unadventurous but you will be satisfied. The staff are more then willing to assist you whatever you might need at any hour of the day or night and always have a smile on their face. I have much much more I could say but no more needs to be said as there is no doubt in my mind that the Ritz Carlton Powerscourt can do no wrong and if you are looking for the most enjoyable hotel experience in Ireland with fantastic things all around to see and do, Stay In the Ritz Carlton.",5,2010,03,09
217,To good of a deal to pass up,"We found a package price through Dooley travel- airfair,car rental, 6 nights at the Ritz for a low price of $799.pp   We thought, it's to good of a deal to pass up?  Turns out it was a Great choice.   We flew into Dublin and drove to the town of Enniskerry, Ireland  and then to the Ritz.   It was a short drive with beautiful country side.  We arrived on a Thursday morning at 8:00am and the hotel was full, so no checking in early  They were open to calling us once the room was ready, which turned out to be at 2:30pm.   We had two rooms with an joining dressing rooms. (4 people)  One room had a king size bed and living room, the other two double beds.  The rooms were very nice, the only negative item was the lighting.   They had no overhead lighting, and the rooms was only light by lamps.   We finally took off the shades to  enchance the light. The cost of the food at the hotel was high-  average $35.00 euro for a Irish breakfast or $350.00 euro for an Irish breakfast, 1/2 bottle of champage and 1 oz of cavier.  Easy drive to Bray to get the train into Dublin. Great breakfast at Poppies in Enniskerry, the Powerscourts garden, while not blooming, worth the trip.",5,2010,03,05
217,Incredible Room...,My wife and I stayed at Powerscourt in late Nov. of '09 and were thoroughly pleased.  The staff was nice and our room was incredible.  We had a really nice stay.,5,2010,03,04
217,Perfect in every way!,"I cannot say enough about this hotel/property. It's perfection and I will definitely go back someday. Maybe not soon, but someday! Take use of their bicycles and go no one of the many trails/aventures. We got stuck in the rain, but that made it all that more memorable. The staff is exceptional and the views are amazing. You will not be disappointed!",5,2010,03,03
217,Great Location but Terrible Breakfast,"We recieved a gift of one night from our family for our 25th. Wedding Anniversary
we had a lovely time and food was good. But the breakfast was terrible for a 5 Star Hotel there was a continental buffet which was very good with yogurts and fresh porrage, BUT the Full Irish was terrible the saussages were deep fried and the skin was broken and saturated in fat. the rashers were poor quality back rashers very salty, and the black and white pudding was like something you would buy in a very cheep supermarket. we  ordered fried eggs, 2 eggs covered in oil were put ontop of the saussages, rashers, pudding and tomatoe. very dissapointing.",4,2010,02,23
217,Elegant and Luxurious - Book thru Amex FHR if a Platinum Card holder,"We stayed at this hotel for a wedding at Powerscourt in the end of August.

The hotel is indeed luxurious with an elegant and refined air. Additionally, it is not a cheap stay so it worthwhile maximising your Euro spent. We booked thru the American Express Fine Hotels & Resort Programme for Platinum and Centurion card holders. Booking thru FHR entitles you to not only the best prices avilable (we got a better discount on the room than what the bride & groom were able to offer guest) but also a selection of perks such as a 4pm check out, 60 Euro restaurant credit, free breakfast and upgrade (if available). 

We were lucky enough to be upgraded to a small suite which was very comfortable; beautiful bathroom and bath tub, very comfortable large king size bed and a lounge space.

The hotel is located out of Eniskerry town so if staying without a car you will need a taxi for dining outside the hotel. The hotel has a Gordon Ramsay restaurant as well as a pub type option and a luxurious cafe-restaurant overlooking the green of the powerscourt estate.

The hotel pool is beautiful and striking set in black and crystals and the poolside is very comfortable with loungers. The spa is also beautiful and makes for a lovely spa-weekend break.",5,2010,02,20
217,Great Stay,"My friend and I booked with Sceptre Tours for this trip months ago and got a great deal! 
The hotel was great overall...very elegant without being stuffy.  It's 20 minutes from Dublin, good if you want to get away from the city-atmosphere.  It's on the beautiful powerscourt estate...the overall atmosphere is so relaxing, like a retreat.  If you can't find the hotel, just pull aside in the little town and ask.
Check-in: First off, we got there around 10A...the room was ready and check-in was quick, much appreciated with.  The bellman, Mark was great...very friendly and got our luggage to the room and gave as a quick tour of the hotel and the different control panels in the room.  Like other reviews have mentioned: bellman and room service attendant would try to run off before you tip them...they're very courteous and don't want to disturb the guests.  
Room: The room(s) were huge, the bathroom great with the heated floors, didn't see the use of the TV in the mirror unless you are soaking in the bath-tub.  The bedroom was separate and spacious...the bed was comfortable, but a bit soft for my liking.  The control panels were so advance, controlling almost everything in the room with it.  
Room Service:  quick and courteous...didn't charge when asked for hot water and they offered us an electric kettle.  The only suggestions would be brighter lights in the living room and more cable channels (very limited channels-compared with American hotels)
Concierge: both gentlemen we spoke with were friendly and very helpful with our questions.   
Restaurants: We ended up on eating mostly in Dublin since we had a rental car.  But we did go to the pub/restaurant within the hotel once...good beer, food and decent prices.  I do recommend Cafe Sol when visiting Kilkenny Castle and Canices Cathedral....great little healthy eatery with friendly staff.  There is a few restaurants in town, Enniskerry...but not too many choices though.  
Gym/Pool: The pool was beautiful...the most relaxing atmosphere I've been to for an indoor pool.  There is no real jacuzzi, the jacuzzi is just next to the pool that massages and is not individually heated, the water is lukewarm.  There is a turkish steam room, which was very relaxing as well.  The gym is large...has all the essential and more than enough for regular gym-goers.  
Check-out: was quick and no surprise charges...asked about our stay and time in Ireland.  

-I would recommend renting a car in Ireland if you will be traveling to different places.  We got the rental from Dan Dooley (they need an extra hand at the airport counter), but based on other reviews, we had an overall good experience...except the GPS wouldn't charge properly, so it would always die.  

-Driving in Dublin wasn't as bad as people said it was.  Nowhere near NY or LA traffic...there are a lot of car parks around and indoor parking wasn't crazy expensive like NYC.  Parking wasn't difficult on the weekday since most places you can park after 7PM.  And you have to go the Temple Bar street to eat and have a few beers and the pubs....the Irish we encountered were very friendly, overall we had a blast.",5,2010,02,18
217,Lovely stay!,"We booked this hotel as part of a package with Sceptre tours.  It was an unbelievable value.  Before we traveled I contacted the hotel via email to get driving directions to the hotel from the airport, which was a very good thing to do.  We also contacted the hotel prior to our stay to set dinner reservations for New Years Eve and New Years Day spa appointments.  The hotel was very quick to respond to my requests via email.

We arrived way before check-in and no room was available yet; they sent us to the lounge for coffee and Annie took good care of us while we waited an hour or so for our room.  Our suite was large with a 3 way view.  Loved the electrically operated drapes.  The touch screen controls for the room worked as expected.  Not sure why 3 televisions, but what the hay!  Loved the heated bathroom floor.  The bathroom had 2 sinks, wc, shower and large soaking tub.  They were not overly generous with the various amenities, shampoo, etc, but there was enough for our 6 night stay.  Seemed a bit odd to only find 2 large towels in the bathroom.  I am sure if we had needed more they would have gladly brought some.

We had dinner in the SugarLoaf restaurant on NYE and enjoyed it very much.  Service was good; the menu was not large, but enough choice to satisfy most anyone. We each enjoyed what we ordered.  Had excellent service many times while warming up by one of the 2 fireplaces in the lobby.  Wait staff would check on us and bring coffee, drinks, whatever and they kept the fire stoked!  Dinner at Gordon Ramsay was about as expected.  Lovely service, picture perfect food.  Wish we had done the 4 course tasting menu as portions were not large.  As I am a chef they let me take a peak into the kitchen which was fun.  It is a massive kitchen.  McGills pub was OK, better than no pub!

Our experience with the spa was wonderful.  The hotel seems to not be too full and the husband and I both had the men's and women's sauna, steam rooms, etc all to ourselves, very luxurious.  My massage therapist was very nice and very good as was my husbands.

Our experience with concierge service while there was somewhat spotty.  The male concierge staff seemed a bit stuffy, while the female staff were more helpful to us.

We enjoyed the short walk to Powerscourt House.  Had several lunches at the Avoca restaurant there.  Unfortunately we were there during a snow storm and the gardens and river walk were not open when we could get there.

I would return here in a heartbeat.  The hotel has a few issues that I choose to overlook.  It is a quality property.  Expect to pay for that once you arrive.",5,2010,01,17
217,"Nothing wrong with the hotel, but buyer beware.","The name Ritz-Carlton conjurs up visions of opulence and service beyond expectations.  Opulence was everywhere and quite spectacular. The staff was very friendly and in most cases very helpful.  Two situations were a bit disconcerting.  We ordered coffee one morning.  The waiter came into the room before my wife could move to a more secluded and private part of the suite.  The other has to do with the concierge and their recommendations for tours.  The concierge was not familiar with the amount of the Wild WIcklow tour that guests at the Ritz-Carlton would miss by being picked up at the hotel.  We missed at least half of the tour and were not made aware that the place where we were dropped off was a part of the tour.  The hotel did make up for the missed part of the trip but it would have been nice to know what we would be missing so that we could have made a more informed decision.  The other has to do with Railtours.  We booked a trip to the Cliffs of Moher and the evening prior to the tour I became ill.  My wife contacted the concierge desk and asked that the trip be cancelled, which it was.  The problem is that the concierge desk left a voice message and did not relay that we could not make the tour due to illness.  Railtours has a 24 hour cancellation policy and will not refund the money for the trip and with the exchange rates this is comes to well over $300usd.  My recommendation is to be very careful when it comes to booking tour packages via the concierge desk because you might not be getting what you expect.",3,2010,01,15
217,Very much enjoyed my stay at this beautiful property,"The hotel and property were magnifiscent. We enjoyed the reception area with view of the mountains. The rooms were also excellent,  views, high scale bathroom, bedding plenty of storage, very nice furniture. Other features we enjoyed were the gym with quality equipment, towels, water, with excellent fountain views. 

Staff was unbelievable, everyone we ran into was very pleasing. The concierge and reception never let us down. From directions, transportation, wake ups, everything was accurate and satisfying. Never a short attitude for stupid questions. 

Sorry we never eat at the restaraunts. We thought they were over priced for us, but we are not the typical Ritz crowd. The pub was nice and the Guiness was fair priced. 
 
The property was very well maintained and probably the most beautiful country views. Parking was easy and free if you dont mind a short walk also has a convienient underground parking (was nice on ice and snow days.)    

Only complaints follow what I would expect from a hotel such as Ritz.  The bellboy on arrival noticed the exterior balcony door latch was not secure and did not have it fixed. Not a security risk but could get locked out quite easily. Internet was not provided, I would expect availability in the room for free (although the concierge let us use the computer to check in for the flight.) 

I would say that I overall had an excellent stay. I have never been to a hotel where it was absolutely perfect and I never had a issue that ruined a minute of my time.",4,2010,01,03
217,Fantastic hotel withi a beautiful setting,Second visit to this wonderful hotel. The spa treatment was attentive and relaxing. The Gordon Ramsey restaurant was very good with knowledgeable staff and fine food.,5,2010,01,03
217,Plush but not cosy,"Very friendly and attentive staff, extremely spacious and well-appointed bedrooms (we were upgraded to a small suite - thank you!), a dreamy spa, scrumptious breakfasts and a gorgeous landscape, even in the late December rain. If I'm being picky, I'd say the exterior looks like a smart American mall - a lot of concrete with classical trills going on out front, and inside the hotel lacks the cosiness you might expect from a luxury rural haven. Apart from two fireside sofa configurations in the main lobby, there is nowhere in this vast establishment to curl up with a book or even with ones thoughts. The plush lounge space is merely an extension of the cavernous reception area and is brightly lit even when even dinner service (for which this area doubles up as overspill from the Sugar Loaf bar/restaurant) is in progress. We sat here for morning coffee and were cold. After one umbrella'd outing to Powerscourt House, we spent too much of our 48-hour stay in our room. During inclement weather, there is little to do except eat or spa. Other than the Irish Times, you can't even get a daily newspaper.

At Ritz Carlton prices (and these are eye-watering for guests converting from sterling, eg £15 for a Caesar salad starter, ££ extra for chicken or prawns; and £170 for a Balinese massage), we had not anticipated that this was the sort of retreat popular with families with small children. We were wrong. This is good news if you have little ones - the hotel clearly likes  kids and the feeling seems mutual. However, this does mean that if you stay at Powerscourt in school holiday time, you're not looking at a romantic sojourn for grown-ups. Eg, the advertised ""children's hours"" in the Swarovski-crystal-lit infinity pool just happen to be ALL the hours the pool is open, so each time we went down for a swim we abandoned mission after finding a dozen two- to 10-year-olds squealing and splashing and having a whale of a time. 

Finally, the Gordon Ramsay restaurant: top-notch service, abundant and pleasing ""amuse-bouches"", but not cuisine that totally set our pulses racing (though the saltiness of the main courses did that job well enough). However, although naturally expensive, quite reasonable when compared with the lobby restaurant and room-service prices. And by the way, they don't tell you, but there's a bar in the Gordon Ramsay where you can take aperitifs before dinner. It's the snuggest room in the whole place, so do head down early rather than sipping your cocktail amid the main traffic in the lobby armchairs.

Housekeeping info: taxi to/from Dublin airport is €80, or €55 to/from Dublin city centre. On a fine day, you can take the Dart (light rail) down the coast - which is stunning in places - to Bray, and hop in a taxi from there, just 10km to the hotel.",4,2009,12,31
217,True 5 Star,"I stayed at the Ritz-Carlton in county Wicklow, Ireland for 1 night. The hotel is truely 5 star with very serviceminded staff and amazing setting.

The hotel is only a couple of years old and everything is build to the very best of quality.

The rooms are very spacious, beds extremely comfortable and absolutely huge. Overall the hotel has every amenity you might need.

The spa area is beautiful and relaxing and the dining- and bar facilities are also great.
If you can get a booking in Gordon Ramsays, then I'd highly recommend that - only set back is that the wine list is marked up to the extreme.

I can only highly recommend this hotel and hope to personally be back again soon.",5,2009,12,29
217,True 5 Star Hotel,"As you can see from my profile I love hotels well This hotel is one of the best I have ever stayed and it is the first 5 stars to get from me on trip advisor... I even had to go back a second time hard to believe we have this kind of quality in Ireland!! 
My only problem is ""paying for broadband"" if travel lodge can include it for free, so can the ritz??

All in all you will not be dissapointed!",5,2009,12,23
217,Amazing,"This hotel has it all - luxury, relaxation and top notch service.  It is a very special place and we loved our stay here.
Our garden view suite was fab... a walk in wardrobe, a massive bathroom complete with a built in TV in the mirror, heated floor, a large bath, separate shower and double sinks.  The living room came with a plasma screen TV and the bedroom had two double beds and a plasma screen TV.
We spent the afternoon in the spa enjoying treatments (great value during our stay, two for one).  The spa is fab and comes with an absolutely gorgeous pool.
Dinner in the Gordon Ramsay restaurant was fantastic and the service was 10/10.  Breakfast the next morning was self service with a wide choice of yummy food.
This luxurious hotel is perfect for that extra special get-away... romance and relaxation.",5,2009,12,21
217,Fantastic,"My first review and have to second the review below, I also celebrated my engagement here :) We also stayed in the mountain view suite, and the room was fantastic. The best room we have ever stayed in. My girlfriend or should I say fiancée was highly impressed. Massive bed, walk in shower, TV in the bathroom etc
The staff were great also, from our arrival to our departure they made the stay extra special. For example spreading rose petals on the bed when returned that night after dinner and drinks :)",5,2009,12,16
217,Couldn`t be more impressed,This hotel looks like it has been there for many years even though it`s just 2 years old as it fits so well into the surroundings. The staff are absolutely suberb and nothing was left to chance. Food was all wonderful and the restaurant is beautiful. Room is probably the best I have ever seen with stunning views over the mountains and incredibly quiet and private. Breakfast should not be missed as it has everything you could want and is much better than many 5 stars. Will definitely be returning.,5,2009,12,07
217,Great place to stay and see,Have to say this was the most oppulent hotel we have ever stayed in. Everything was perfect but expensive. Oh to be wealthy. Pool and spa area were beautiful and relaxing. Staff were freindly especially the concierge. Suite was huge and perfect. Did eat one meal at the Chef Ramsey restaurant included in our package and had the 7 course Chef's surprise. It took 2 hours for dinner and was relaxing. We can't afford to stay in a Ritz unless there is a unbelievable special but DON'T turn down the opportunity if it comes along,5,2009,12,01
217,Best spot ever!,"I am just back after a fantastic w/end at the Ritz Carlton Powerscourt.

We were down at the hotel to celebrate our engagement.

Our experience began with our car being taken (valet parking) and bags brought to the room. We were booked into a garden view suite originally but were upgraded to a mountain view suite on account of the occassion.

The room was unbelievable! Two bathrooms, walk in wardrobe, sitting room, 2 plasma tvs, 6 foot bed, large bath, separte shower area and a tv built into the mirror of the bathroom! We also had a large balconey area which looked onto the grounds of the hotel - beautiful!

We had afternoon tea in the lobby. This was really nice and a nice touch with champagne with it.

Later that evening we went to the Gordon Ramsay restaurant. Again, top notch with lovely food and great service.

Breakfast in the morning was available until 10:30. Try and get there by 10 as there was a bit of a back log of people waiting for a table who arrived just before 1030. Breakfast was self-service with great choice and agin lovely food.

We had a look around the spa, gym and pool but didn't use these as we forgot our gym gear. The pool is gorgeous!

Our overall experience at this hotel was flawless from the facilities to the food and also the staff who were really excellent.

Worth the 5* !!",5,2009,11,30
217,Greatest place I've ever stayed!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!,"We spent 6 days with our friends in Nov. 2009. The hotel is incredible, the luxury is almost obscene! We had a suite with an adjoining deluxe room, heated bathroom floors with TV in the mirror, remote control curtains, electronic this, automatic that--list is endless.

Indoor pool a treat, simply walking the gardens, is awe inspiring. 30 mins from Dublin via DART.

Quite simply the best vacation we've ever had, and the Ritz is responsible for a lot of that!",5,2009,11,15
217,fantastic hotel,We celebrated our 25th wedding anniverary in a suite at the ritz carlton it was fantastic .The rooms are  finished to perfection the service is the best we have ever received.Gordon ramsay restaurant was very high standard. just a absolute perfect anniversary the hotel staff made it very special time we would definately return.,5,2009,11,13
217,Worth travelling for,"I can't believe anyone could fail to give this hotel absolutely top rating. It is admittedly very expensive - they charge good value room rates, but make up for this in the price of incidentals, such as drinks.
It's the most luxurious, relaxing and absolutely perfectly fitted hotel I've come across in a long time and far exceeds the quality of hotels in a similar price category that I've stayed in recently. For a change the pictures you see on the hotel website are an exact representation of what you see when you arrive. 
I would travel from London just to stay here for the weekend. I particularly liked the breakfast buffet selection, although since I'm seriously addicted to caffeine I did find the lack of my own coffee pot annoying - can't survive on just one small cup I'm afraid!",5,2009,11,02
217,"Definitely not 5 stars, but nice nonetheless","My husband and I just returned from a week visiting Dublin, and we spent six nights at the Ritz in a suite.  Before I go too far, I want to mention that the Ritz is not very easy to find, and did not show up as a location on the local Garmin GPS system that came with the rental car.  We instead had to punch in the Powerscourt Hotel, which is somewhat nearby, and then drive around until we finally saw a sign for the estate and the smaller Ritz sign.  If you happen to have the same problem, head to the Powerscourt Hotel, which is located on a small roundabout, and continue to the first exit, so you will pass the hotel on your right, and you will continue up a hill that curves to the right.  Well up the street, on the right side, you will see a large white sign for the Powerscourt Estate, and a small blue sign for the Ritz. Turn right here and head through the first set of black iron gates, which are unmarked, (and closed at night so that you have to be buzzed in).  Continue through here and make the first left, which leads you down to the Ritz through a second set of iron gates.  The journey from the roundabout takes a little over 5 minutes.  

We arrived on Sunday in the late morning, but I was disappointed to find that we were not able to be checked in right away.  I completely understand that this is not guaranteed, but I had checked to see if there was still room availability on the website the morning we left, and there were still suites per the site.  We read books on one of the couches near the fireplace for the next two hours until a room opened up for us.  The front desk was very apologetic, but they were all very young (even to us, and we’re in our 20s) and not the most experienced.  

We were given room 693, and I'm still not sure if this was a Mountain View or Garden View since we couldn't see either very well - this overlooks the front of the hotel where the parking lot is located, as well as some lush hills beyond.  

Our room did not have a separate living room, but it did have a spacious sitting area, and we had a small wardrobe in the entrance room.  I will echo other reviewers in that there were far too few hangers - maybe eight for two people.  There was no wireless internet in our room or in the lobby, and we never received any complimentary newspapers.  Like at least one other person who wrote, I also found that the small knob on the door to the toilet came off, but I was able to shove it back in decently.  I think was bothered me most about the service was that housekeeping didn't replace the lotion or q-tips until our fifth day - and only after I cleared off the counter and placed the empty lotion and wrapper in plain sight.  

We did get new shampoo/conditioner/bodywash nearly every day, but that was the extent of the amenities, which is really poor for a Ritz.  No razor, toothbrush, or anything besides the basics you'd get anywhere else.  There was a bottle of bath salts, but I think the lid was glued on – I tried many times to get the lid off with no luck.  Each night, we would get a chocolate and a small bottle of water on our bedside table. I have to add that we were very grossed out by the toilet brush which was, er, dirty when we arrived and was not cleaned or replaced during our entire stay.   I finally rinsed it in the tub a bit myself.  Everything else in the bathroom was cleaned immaculately.  

Our other major problem was the bed.  One side of the mattress was completely crushed to the point that I would actually roll to that side of the bed during the course of the night.  We didn't notice the problem right away since you couldn't tell by the looks of it, but it was uncomfortable and that mattress needs to be replaced.  I really should have called to complain about this, but we didn't discover it until we'd unpacked and hung up our clothes and settled in, and switching rooms seemed like much too much effort in our jetlagged state.  At least the bed was large enough for us to squeeze over to one side to avoid the dip.  

We did love the automatic drapes, and it was lovely to have the largest wall of the room almost entirely made of windows.  The rain, which fell every day, was very loud against the windows, so beware of that.  It would wake me up at night and even drown out the television.  

We didn't eat anything at the hotel, but we did have a Guinness in the lobby one evening, and the service was quick and efficient.  We'd considered going to the pub downstairs, but it was empty so we stayed away.  

Driving to Dublin took about 30 minutes if we left the hotel around 10am, and one day took an hour and a half due to earlier morning commuter traffic.  The roads in Enniskerry where the hotel is located are not great; there are major potholes and the roads are very curvy and quite narrow.  The road that the Ritz is on is much better.  The nearby M50 and other freeways are excellent.  

If we return to Dublin, I would much prefer to stay in the city itself.  The Ritz was a fine place to stay, but the benefits in no way outweighed the inconvenience of being far from the city in what turned out to be an average hotel.  Had it been very luxurious, I'm sure I would think differently.",3,2009,10,28
217,"Wonderful hotel, great experience.","We stayed for six nights...part of a package (air, rental car and hotel) booked through Sceptre Tours. How we ended up in this fabulous hotel for the price we paid, I have no idea. Rooms were amazing; service was outstanding. We didn't dine at Gordon Ramsey's but enjoyed the pub and scones and coffee/tea in the mornings. I've read the negative reviews here...we didn't experience anything of the sort.",5,2009,10,18
217,Paradise,"Well this is a little gem, stayed here with my partner and now have faith in hotels in ireland, after my nightmare stay in the other hotel,
this was first class establishment and great value, from the moment we stayed here we were looked after by the company,
the grounds are fantastic with some great views, 
the rooms were huge airy, king size beds everything i could want , 
reception area is so well organised and the restaurant was probably one of the best desinged i have ever been in, the food well it was just heaven 
over  all brilliant well worth it",4,2009,10,16
217,great deals to be had,"We booked our stay with the Amex Fine Hotels and Resorts and got a tremendously good value package. We were upgraded to a spectacular junior suite. The rooms are jaw-droppingly beautiful, with wonderful amenities and features (incl a rain shower, jacuzzi tub, dual vanities, walk-in-closet etc.). The room's drapes, TV, lights, sound are all controlled from an electronic console. 

Dinner at Ramsey's was lovely. For E95 each we had a prestige tasting menu and enjoyed every course. The staff were delightful. There were only 3 other couples dining and a large (raucous) group. Staff provided complimentary champagne to toast our anniversary. 

The spa is indeed something to behold. The pool is stunning (lovely darkened room and the pool is bejeweled with Swarovski crystals), but the thermal suites upstairs are a whole lot of luxury. You need to be getting a treatment to access the upstairs thermal suites, but it's certainly worth it. We had the place to ourselves! The gym equipment downstairs is as expected. 

The local river walk (must be accessed only with hotel staff) is a delight on a Fall morning, and of course the Powerscourt house gardens are a must see. 

All in all, even with the unfavorable Euro-Dollar exchange, we had tremendous value out of our (mostly all included) package. highly recommended.",5,2009,10,13
217,Beautiful location,"Gorgeous trees, postcard views of Wicklow Mountains, beautiful landscaping.  One of the best features of this hotel is the pool.  Parking, weight room, pool are all free of charge.  Hotel is 40 minutes from Dublin airport.  15 minutes from DART in Bray, Ireland.  Can walk to Enniskerry for restaurants and quick mart.  Excellent service from the concierge.  Breakfast buffet was included with our room rate and was extensive.  We would stay here again.  Restaurants, however, are very pricey.  Hamburger and fries were $40.  (One suggestion for the rooms - add more lightly to the bedroom.  Too dark.",5,2009,10,12
217,This hotel is magnificent,"We stayed one night in March as part of  a  fly/drive package. The facilities are simply top notch. The view from the balcony was magnificent, the rooms (we had a suite) were superb.  The marble bathrooms (there were one and a half) were marble with separate rooms for the shower, commode, and bath tub and sink.  Our friend's suite even had a butler's pantry.  No amenity was overlooked.  The staff was extremely friendly and accommodating.  Our flight was too early for the breakfast that was included in the package, so they gave us room service.",5,2009,10,10
217,"Beautiful hotel and setting, but a bit stuffy.","My husband and I traveled to Ireland with another couple.  We booked our package trip through Britain & Ireland Vacations.  The package included six nights at the Powerscourt Ritz Carlton.  The hotel served as our ""home base"" for a week of exploring Ireland.  The hotel is beautiful, and the staff was very friendly.  The rooms are spacious and very comfortable.  We had a suite room with a connecting deluxe room for the four of us.  We were hoping the suite sitting area would be in the middle of the ""bedrooms"", but this was not the case.  The connecting deluxe room was on the ""bedroom"" side of the suite.  Our friends had to come through our room to utilize the sitting area. (If you view pictures on the hotel website, this will make more sense!)  
When I confirmed our reservations before arrival, we were told we would be in a mountain view suite, but when we  got to our room, we discovered it was ""garden view"" (really just a view of the fountain).  We did not go through the hassle of going back to the front desk to complain due to the fact that we were not going to be in the room much and they accomodated our early arrival (10:30 AM)  It was nice to be able to check in and get a shower after an overnight flight!  I would recommend the mountain view, however.  Confirm this at the front desk before you are taken to your room.
The hotel was very empty while we were there.  I believe the economy is the culprit.  It was an extremely stuffy and quiet environment.  We traveled around Ireland from morning to night, so we did not eat at the hotel at all.  Based on the reviews we read about the restaurant and pub, we chose to eat elsewhere.  We did use room service for coffee in the morning. We ordered a pot four mornings for a grand total of 50 euros on our bill at checkout.  If you are a coffee drinker, it is worth it because this is your only option without driving into Enniskerry.
Overall, the hotel was very quiet and comfortable for a good night's rest!  We looked forward to getting back to our rooms after our full days of touring.  If you are looking for a peaceful and romantic get-away, this hotel if for you (and really your only option besides a B&B in this area.)  The close proximity to the Powerscourt Estate & Gardens is nice.  If you like a more lively crowd with a hopping pub, then this is not the hotel for you.  I also do not recommend this hotel for children.",4,2009,10,09
217,Outstanding,"Excellent vacation. take the DART into Dublin and eat at the ""Queen of Tarts""  Visit the ""Beatty Library"" and ride the hop on bus tour. Great city and beautiful hotel.",5,2009,10,09
217,Simply outstanding,"What a fabulous hotel!  Exceptional service, very good food, extremely comfortable room (we had a suite).  There was simply nothing we didn't enjoy about our stay, from the free bicycle loans and the concierge assistance with reservations for horseback riding and planning our daytrips, to the location (Eniskerry is charming and very easy drive all over Dublin/Wicklow area).  The hotel had a number of thoughtful touches, like heated floors in the bathroom, central lighting/heat control by touchpad, comfortable lobby/lounge, and good bar menu.  The pool area was one of the most beautiful and relaxing we've seen, exclipsing Four Seasons Maui and the like.  The grounds around this hotel are also spectacular, and warrant at least a day to enjoy by themselves.",5,2009,10,08
217,"Beautiful grounds, spectacular locale.","After 3 days in Paris, we attended a wedding here. Not only was every single member of the staff friendly and helpful, the room was classically luxurious, with modern touches and lots ot space. The bathroom was first-rate, and we felt our stay was well worth the price. There were bikes for rent and a fabulous pool and fitness center. And the concierge went above and beyond for services we required. We were so sad to have to go home, and we hope to return to this hotel soon.",5,2009,10,07
217,You will not be dissapointed!,"This was the perfect combination of beautiful surroundings and beautiful people. From the moment you drive through the village of Eniskerry and up the winding mountain side roads, you begin to realize you are no longer in Kansas. 

The experience that is the Ritz Carlton, Powerscourt is unique in that it has a country chateau feel that is blended perfectly with everything you would expect from a Ritz Carlton. Nestled in the Sugarloaf mountainside and a superbly appointed lobby, the only thing that makes the first impression more dramatic is the staff. Without question, the most professional, helpful, yet unpretentious staff we have ever encountered in our travels throughout Europe and North America. Everyone was gracious and helpful, but concierges Robert (Robbie, a local) and Lars were remarkable and helped us is every way imaginable. 

Our Mountain View suite was opulent and spacious with a heated floor in the bathroom my bride adored, and a huge balcony overlooking the well manicured grounds and the lush Irish landscape. The rooms were superbly maintained and featured touch pad controls for lighting, room temperature and do not disturb indicators which illuminated a red light in the hall that made the always friendly and efficient housekeeping staff aware of our wishes . This feature was particularly useful as my wife and I succumbed to the warm comfort of the bedding until after noon on more than one occasion.  

We also enjoyed food and beverage in all three of the hotels restaurants. The highlight was dinner at Gordon Ramsey's. Although the food was excellent, nothing from the menu screamed ""the best you have ever had."" The service, however, was second to none. Our primary server, Sarah, a young gentleman from Malaysia, made the dining experience one we will never forget. He was extremely reserved for the first half of our dinner, despite my consistent efforts to make him laugh. When he came to clear our plates, he looked at me and said with a completely straight face, ""I see you didn't enjoy your meal."" Of course, there was nothing but plate after I had consumed my Tipperary beef. From that point forward we were entertained by Sarah and his staff, which even included a tour of the amazing kitchen. 

We rode bikes, played Yahtzee in the lobby by the wood burning fireplaces and never once felt we didn't belong. The welcoming Irish people, the quaint mountain roads and picturesque landscape, and this fabulous hotel made our vacation one for the ages. 

The only challenge this trip presented was our rental car from Dan Dooley. Avoid this place at all costs. We met three other couples on this trip who had the same (or worse) experience as we did with Dooley's beaten down, high mileage heaps that cost us far more than we could have imagined.",5,2009,09,29
217,A wondeful hotel but a little boring,"Booked this hotel as a last break for the children and ourselves before school started again.  Hotel was really outstanding, beautiful rooms, lovely spacious balconies and helpful staff.  If my husband and i were on our own i would not hesitate to go back and maybe book spa treatment (although very pricey)
On the minus side which are few i find the hotel quite boring in the evening with not even a little bit of music playing anywhere.  The children are only allowed to swim from 9-5 which if out all day sightseeing is not convenient and is the only activity they can do. We stayed the same week-end as the last reviewers and the queue was unbelievable at breakfast the sunday morning after the reviewers wedding (which we were not at)  i think that as they should be experienced now to coping with weddings they should have the wit to open another room for breakfast after a wedding has taken place in hotel as the fourseasons do (its not rocket science)",5,2009,08,25
217,Good hotel but so close to being great,"We stayed in the Ritz-Carlton after attending a wedding in Powerscourt House (which was fabulous!).  This is a five star hotel in a five star location.  So much of our experience was simply excellent but unfortunately there were a few small details that let the hotel down.

Check in was smooth and efficient.  Our room located on the third floor (one floor below the lobby) was clean, stylish and extremely comfortable.  The bathroom was particularly opulent, although it was lacking some of the products that you would expect to find in a bathroom of a hotel of this callibur.  For example, we had to request a dental/hygiene pack from housekeeping (I should mention that it was delivered immediately).

We attended a wedding and returned to the hotel residents' bar around 02.00.  The bar closed shortly before 03.00 and while that was fine and it probably time for us to go to bed anyway, we were ushered out of McGills bar in a manner more associated with a temple bar night club than a quiet bar in a five star hotel.  There was a group of approximately 15 of us, finishing drinks (bought for top dollar prices) and chatting about the day that had been.  We had already begun to make a move to vacate when a member of staff (I understand that he was a manager, although he had the manner of bouncer) actually began to shout at us to leave.  Over the next five minutes that it took for people to say their goodnights, he shouted at us three more times (I counted).  We were in no way loud or boisterous and it seemed to be assumed that because we were up that late we were obviously drunk, and deaf.  It was unneccesary and unpleasant and we went to bed disappointed with how the evening had ended.

Breakfast finished at 10.30 the following morning and when we arrived at 09.50 we were told that there was a 40 minute wait to be seated.  It amazes me that a hotel would not be prepared for numbers of guests seeking breakfast on a Sunday morning.  I suggested that my husband and I put our names down on the waiting list and go for a walk and come back in half an hour or so but the hostess said that if we missed our place in the line we would have to go back to the end of the queue again.  So we simply sat and waited.  To be fair to the hostess (who was a little brisk but efficient) the line moved quite quickly (we waited approximately 10 minutes) and I think that it was her colleagues inside that we letting her down, not re-setting the tables as they were vacated.  Breakfast was extended until 11.30 or so and it was excellent - worth the wait!

We were facilitated with a late check out time which was much appreciated.  My husband had a swim and reported that the pool area was fine.  He was particularly impressed with the steam room.  I enjoyed the luxurious bathroom and the wonderfully deep tub.  

Again check out was efficient and there were plenty of attentive staff on hand to assist us and our friends with our baggage.

We really enjoyed our stay and I would stay in this hotel again.  However, it was just a shame that some minor flaws tainted the experience.  This hotel could be top class.",4,2009,08,24
217,true 5 star,"I was surprised at some of the comments, it seemed to me that the staff had extra 5 star training - I found all of them performed above the recommended standard..  Of course you are paying for it -  The location is amazing in Powercourt park and grounds, very tranquil, but you would need a car to go anywhere.  One of the staff gave me a lift down to the nearest village as part of the service, then came with me to make sure I got what I wanted.  Thats above the call of duty!

The rooms are large and Rizty as you would expect for a 3 year old hotel, the suites have  a shoe wardrobe, we were all amused by those.   The food excellent but pricy, and I agree with the grumbles of others, there is no cafe for a lunch or light dinner, the only choice being the lobby - comfy chairs and low tables are NOT conducive to dining.  

My only real service complaint would be, it was almost impossible to get online (Iphone) and they didnt replenish my mini bar - but maybe they were trying to tell me something about our drinking !!

If I was wanted a romantic break (nothing to do in the immediate area) in the countryside I would DEFinately same here again.",5,2009,08,21
217,Very good hotel but lacks individuality,"Stayed at the Ritz-Carlton to attend a friend's wedding held at the nearby Powerscourt House. Got upgraded to the junior suite, which was very nice. The room was very spacious, with a balcony which we hardly ever use as it opens out to the carpark, instead of the so-called garden. the staff were charming, especially Albert at the concierge desk, who efficiently helped us with our dinner reservations, and getting the bicyces out for us in the morning. The spa and health facilities were excellent, and well looked after.",4,2009,08,17
217,Beautiful Accomodations/Friendly Team,"The Ritz Carlton  Powercourt is located in the country side in beautiful Wicklow Co, Ireland.  My wife and I enjoyed the experience and stay which lasted 6 nights.

We spent several nights in Dublin City Centre and then came down to Wicklow and were immediately surprised by the beauty and wonderful views of the countryside.  The Powerscourt Estate and surrounding area was simply gorgeous.

The rooms were spacious with amazing accomodations.  The beds were very comfortable and soft and we enjoyed a balcony view with private seating area.  Each and everything we needed to make our stay comfortable was in the room upon our arrival.  Very clean and modern.

The resort has multiple services which were perfect for our stay.  The spa is top notch and the pool and hottubs were simply elegant.  

The Gordon Ramsey restaurant was top notch and surprising offered good value for the dinner we had on two different nights.  Service was AAAA.  We enjoyed several pints at McGills (Irish pub in hotel).  Nice and clean but very pricey.  Food for room service and tea room room was overpriced.

We also highly recommend traveling into Enniskerry.  The Concierge will take you for free.  We enjoyed great pub food at Nancy Murphy's.   Live Music and relaxing scene.  Emilios and Italian restaurant made us feel back home.  Good wine and food.",5,2009,08,07
217,Beautiful Hotel but expensive,"Went for  a kid free weekend.  Beautiful hotel, huge rooms, but very expensive.  Hotel restaurant - Gordon Ramsay - over rated.  Table positions not great in restaurant, had to ask to be moved. Even though the restaurant wasnt busy we were put in a tiny alcove, there were a lot of main table available.  Spa was lovely very relaxing.  Staff were not overly friendly or helpful, would expect a bit more for the price.  Nice to experience just the once.",4,2009,08,06
217,Base Camp at Ritz Carlton Powerscourt,"I recently met a group of friends in Ireland and we hiked the Wicklow Mountains in County Wicklow south of Dublin about a hour drive.  The nicest base camp ever, the Ritz Carlton Powerscourt is well located with lovely little villages nearby and awesome hiking trails. The Powerscourt gardens are a must do and the hotel has an amazing indoor pool and spa, bikes are available for free to ride the property or local roads which are a bit tight to bike on. I especially liked Glendalough for hiking, just beautiful!  We had a local hiking guide and good weather throughout the trip.  The Ritz PC had the most comfortable bed I've ever slept in, wish I could bring it home.  The food and service were also excellent.  I would recommend a car or a car/driver to take you to the local places of interest of which there are many.",5,2009,08,04
217,Not worth it.,"Powerscourt gardens themselves are magnificent.  Having a Ritz on the property seemed an ideal way to start my trip.  The lady doing the booking for them was incredibly friendly and kind on the internet and called to see how I was doing while there.  She was excellent.  The rest of the staff were distant at best.  I had to keep waving my napkin at the waitress in the lobby lounge restaurant to get her attention.  The staff needs training.
Polite, yes.  ""Hardly have time for you,"" no.

The outside, at the bottom of a hall, with parking lots all over, is rather commercial looking.  The lobby is very grand, as you would expect at a Ritz.  I was upgraded to a suite which had a pleasaant view of a mountain.  Now I suppose you can call it a mountain, but it is more like a high, rather barren hill.  Nice, but not dramatic, not worth paying special money to have a view of.  The patio was rather sterile.  The rooms had few pictures.  It looked like they had not finished decorating it and was very dark.  The lights seemed for decoration, not illumination.  It certainly was not at all cozy.

The food was astronomically expensive.  Three quarter pieces of a slice of brown bed, a hunk of salmon on each, a small salad on the plate and two small glass of Diet Coke came to the equivalent of $38.  Isn't that silly?   Dinners were worse.  The food was fine, but no more than you would expect at any good hotel.",3,2009,07,30
217,Don't go there during the week!,"Very dissapointed with our stay in this hotel. It seems that the mission of the hotel is to close everything down on a Monday & Tuesday and guests and discouraged to get in the way! Firstly the heavily advertised McGills pub is closed on Mondays & Tuesday as we were told that there is very little custom during those days - a bit of chicken & egg! As they say on their website, ""McGills will quench the thirst of any weary traveler"" but they omit to say as long as the weary travller arrives at a convenient time to them so that they can be bothered to open up! Hardly in the famous Irish tradition.

Secondly when we were sent to the hotel lobby bar after our dinner, we were asked for last orders at 11:30pm as the residents bar does not stay open if there are not enough guests as was explained to us! We were told that we could instead get some wine brought to our room and it was also suggested to us that we order the bottle of wine directly from the bar so that we could bring the bottle & glasses up ourselves in order to not inconvenience room service!

All the little details that distinguish a proper five star establishment were missing: we only had one chair on our patio, the 65 Euro breakfast was made of rubber, the club lounge did not exist despite extensive signage to the contrary and finally we were surrounded by diners in flip flops and t-shirts at the Gordon Ramsy restaurant!

Nice location but not worth the effort or the money!",2,2009,07,28
217,Lived up to Expectations of a five star hotel,"We stayed in The Ritz Carlton for 5 days on the 'Peace of mind' package and we were not dissapointed. Everything was faultless. We had garden view suite and it was beautiful. Loved the walk in closets. Would love to have one of those in my house. bathroom as other reviews georgous. We went for our first break away with our 4 and half month old baby and the staff had organised a crib in the room for us and a baby sitter Anna who was lovely for when we went out for dinner. The walks around the hotel and powerscourt  suited us perfectly as we wanted quiet and relaxing. I have to note what i liked best about this hotel is although it is a luxury five star hotel, and we save up to go on these trips, (we are not full of money)  but sometimes when in a 5star hotel staff are so stuffy, but not here. Staff indeed are lovely and mannerly and always speak to you. Everyone is treated the same, none of the  protentious nonsence, and you feel like a guest and at home in these lovely surroundings. Oh how I wish it was home. Oh well, until my next visit, as I will be back, Thank you for a lovely stay at the Ritz Carlton Powerscourt. Highly Recommend it.
Offaly Visitor.",5,2009,07,12
217,Elegant and comfortable....superb,This stay was a  highlight and included the tasting menu at the on site Gordon Ramsey restaurant....a must for foodies....the Powerscourt House and gardens are on the grounds and the Wicklow Mountains are worth a visit.,5,2009,07,09
217,Ritz Glitz,"Fantastic , and i mean FANTASTIC location for a hotel. Found the service in the bar a bit up and down at times but the staff were all very friendly.

217,Fantastic Hotel,"Have just returned from a weekend break at the Ritz-Carlton and this truely is a 5 star hotel. We stayed in a mountain view suite which was very spacious, loved the TV on the bathroom mirror and had a large balcony with gorgeous views.
We also used the spa which is a little expensive and the fitness area which has a lovely pool. 
We ate in Gordon Ramseys restaurant and even though the service was a little slow could not fault the food or the restaurant. Staff very friendly.
Overall a great stay and would definitely recommend this hotel.",5,2009,06,28
217,Outstanding Hotel,"This is an amazing hotel in a very secluded area. The room was very large and spacious and the bathroom even had a TV screen fitted in the mirror. Because we went out of season we got an excellent deal that included breakfast, a visit to the spa with massage and dinner for two at Gordon Ramsays. Unfortunately the Euro was so strong against the pound that it still worked out very expensive but would have been an amazing deal in better times. Value for money therefore was difficult to calculate but prices in the bar etc seemed quite considerably higher than elsewhere. Whilst there, the Powerscourt gardens is well worth a visit as is the nearby village. This is a great hotel to relax in and we can think of nothing to fault it.",5,2009,06,25
217,Beautiful rooms and lovely setting,"We stayed only 1 night at the Ritz. We enjoyed every minute of our stay.  Our suite was large, elegant and very comfortable. The beds were dreamy.  We started our stay with drinks on the balcony overlooking the fountain with the mountains in the background.  We then enjoyed the indoor pool, sauna and steam room. Dinner later was good and we had a restful night's sleep.  Powerscourt gardens are a few minutes away and we very much enjoyed them.",5,2009,06,13
217,Just Beautiful,Stayed here for one night. Top end hotel that is a destination in itself,5,2009,06,06
217,Fabulous,"Stayed at the Ritz Carlton Powerscourt May 6-8, 2009. I give this hotel the highest rating possible.  The staff was incredibly friendly, courteous and helpful... and genuinely so.  The facilities were brand new and immaculately maintained.  We were upgraded upon arrival to a spacious suite with large balcony.  Rooms were some of the nicest and most modern I've seen, with Lutron home automation systems running everything.  The gym and Spa facilities are top notch.  As nice as anything I""ve seen in New York and L.A.  Plus there's a Gordon Ramsey restaurant which is exquisite.

I would recommend this hotel to everyone visiting the East Coast of Ireland.  Its only a 25 minute drive on the highway from Dublin.

I've been to Ireland several times over the years and I'm amazed just how far the accomodations have come.  This Ritz clearly raises the bar.",5,2009,05,27
217,A rare luxury stay for our family.,"We stayed one night at the Ritz which was part of an Aer Lingus package, and we were absolutely over the moon with being able to stay here.  We would never have been able to book this hotel on our own as we would have needed two rooms as our children are older (10 & 14) and couldn't afford it.  However, the vacation package included an upgrade to two suites so the kids had their own suite with private balcony!  The setting is just lovely, and walking distance to the Powerscourt Gardens.  We had dinner at the pub and everything was very good (bread pudding was decadently delicious!)  My daughter felt like a princess in the bathtub, while she watched Princess Diaries on the mirror tv!  The pool was a very relaxing treat, I had it all to myself! The only complaint was that our stay was much too short!",5,2009,05,18
217,Perfect Romantic Place to Go,"This Ritz is brand new and so there are no issues about it being clean and perfect where everything is concerned. I just wanted to recommend this hotel to everyone who may be in the area, its worth the money and you will enjoy your time. We wished we could have stayed longer - and I do want to return. The grounds are beautiful - fresh air amazing, food was ok, but our room was huge and the bathrooms were plush and had great flow. We had two large patio decks off our room - I wish I had more time to spend on them! The spa (although pool heater was not working) was still great and all the steam rooms were a pleasure. Everything is well done and nice and very relaxing. Another wonderful Ritz thank you!",5,2009,05,08
217,Won this visit as a prize - what a prize!,"I won this trip of an overnight stay for 2 persons, including bed, breakfast, evening meal and spa treatments.  My daughter and I were looking forward to some pampering, relaxation and good food.  We weren't disappointed.

Check-in:
A friendly bellboy opened the revolving doors for us, welcomed us and helped with our bags. We arrived just before the 3 pm check-in and had a short wait for our room to be available.  The lobby is beautifully decorated, with seating grouped around welcoming fireplaces which had real fires burning.

Room:
Our room was huge, overlooking a garden.  The average size of rooms there is 700 sq ft, bigger than the average 1-bed apartment.  We had an entrance hall with full length mirror, fridge with minibar and shelving to take glasses, wine etc.  To the left was a dressing room with huge wardrobes and shelf space.  To the right double doors led into the bathroom and what a bathroom!  Double basins, huge bath, shower wetroom with fabulous sprays – a flick of the remote control turned on the hidden TV in the mirror – what luxury.
The style was “Presidential” and we had two double beds, floor to ceiling windows, desk, armchairs with footstool etc.  We had fun trying out the remote controlled curtains – even the “Do not Disturb” sign on the door was worked by remote control.

The only downside was that internet access was €12,50 an hour which I felt was totally overpriced.

Food:
We had dinner in the Sugar Loaf restaurant. To start we had Bruschetta 
Wild Mushrooms, Baby Spinach Salad.  Unfortunately there was a piece of wood included in mine.  I drew the waiter's attention to this and the chef sent an apology and offered free drinks or a dessert to compensate.  His explanation was that the mushrooms come in cartons and a piece must have chipped off!  Not good enough for a 5-star hotel I thought.  For the main course we both ordered  ‘Fish & Chips’
Traditional Tartar, Mushy Peas.  The batter was really light and the cod was really delicious.  Portions were very large and we found it difficult to finish it all. However, we had to leave room for dessert.  I had Wicklow Blueberry & Apple Crumble 
Crème Fraiche Sorbet (fab) and my daughter ordered Pavlova 
Marinated Strawberries, Crème Chantilly which was beautifully presented.  We finished off with Cappuccino and Irish Martinis.

Breakfast next morning was very relaxing, everything you could think of was available and more!

Leisure:
•	Emerald Crystal Steam Room 
•	Sauna 
•	Ice Fountain 
•	Vitality Pool 
•	Tepidariums – heated relaxation loungers 
•	Relaxation Room

The pool and sauna/steam room was world class, very relaxing, nice stone floors and walls with great power waterfalls.  You are overlooking fountains and the Sugar Loaf Mountain from the upstairs spa area. The Vitality pool has a series of metal pipes arranged in the shape of a recliner on which you lie back on and though which very fine air bubbles are emitted - simply superb!

The gym is equipped with treadmills, some weights machines and exercise bikes.

Our Day Spa Escape at ESPA included
    
        ESPA Stress-Releasing Back, Neck and Shoulder Massage
        Revitalising Eye Treatment
        Oriental Head Massage
        Health-oriented lunch in the Spa Café
        Spa Pedicure with foot and ankle massage

Overall the building is very attractive, staff are helpful, great spa and the room was   really comfortable. Need I say more – we enjoyed every minute of it.  Thanks iVenus for a truly great prize.",4,2009,05,05
217,Lovely but expensive hotel with amazing scenery all around.,"We attended a wedding at the Powerscourt House. The house is about 6 mins. walk from hotel & catering there is provided by the Ritz Carlton. We could have done without having to drive from wedding venue back to our hotel room & find parking at each end.
Both wedding & hotel stay experiences were good. We had a lovely room with patio & loungers overlooking the Sugarloaf Mountain. Breakfast in the room was served bang on time as requested & piping hot in a heated trolley/dining table. Staff were always readily available & keen to help.A minor gripe were the emphasis on room service food & bev. but no tea/coffe making facilities even though everything else one could want was in the room. The door to patio was almost impossible to open & I cut my finger in my efforts with the awful lock. When I mentioned this to the nice receptionist she admitted that several clients had similar problems with what she said was more of a design problem than a faulty mechanism.
Despite this we really enjoyed the genuine 5 star experience & at a time when the hotel was fully booked.",5,2009,05,03
217,Putting On The Ritz !,"Stayed at this amazing property over Easter, the hotel is spectacular and staff amazing, especially the lovely waitress from Italy that worked in the Sugar Loaf Lounge! 
I booked a Mountain View Suite and it was simply one of the nicest rooms we have stayed in! The staff called several times prior to my arrival regarding my preferences etc, 
This is what I expect from a 5* property and I was not dissapointed. 
The food in the Bar and Lounge was great and the cocktails were outstanding, (you must try a Singapore Sling) We loved the area too and the gardens are fabulous! 

We thoroughly enjoyed our stay and the only 2 negative points for us were 1) problems at check out, these were unecessary but the hotel was more than helpful to asisst us in sorting these out. Hats off to the Accomodation and Reservations Managers! 
Also, I am a real foodie with a discerning palate, however, I did not enjoy my meal at Gordon Ramsey's I felt that the abundance of staff and over complicated menu choices were not to my, nor my partners taste. The staff were lovely, don't get me wrong, but the food was overly fussy. 

All in all, we had a fabulous time, the staff were 5* and the hotel will not dissapoint! 
Book a Mountain View suite and treat yourself! 

As you will all probably tell from my reviews, I am quite fussy and I expect the best of everything when I stay somewhere - aside from the comments above, it was one of the nicest breaks I have ever had, go into Bray for the day to sample the local culture and food etc. 

A truly luxurious hotel and amazing staff! We cant wait to go back!!",5,2009,04,30
217,Great for a short break,"We stayed in a standard room which was very large and comfortable. The bathroom was great, with a large bath and separate shower, fluffy robes and slippers. The television embedded in the bathroom mirror was kind of cool too. The bed was very comfortable and 200x200 in size. The seating needs to be improved however - there was only one armchair in the room and no sofa, although the room was easily large enough to take extra furniture. They supply four clothes hangers only between two wardrobes. Internet access is as expensive as you may expect. I was disappointed that no gesture was made to mark the birthday we were celebrating, even though when booking I was asked if we were marking a special event. I'm unclear why they ask if the information is to be ignored.

Dinner in the Sugar Loaf lobby was good - the menu is limited and concentrates on barfood type options (fish and chips, burger etc) but was well done. The wine list in the Sugar Loaf is limited , you can get the full list from the Gordon Ramsay restaurant downstairs but the prices are absolutely astronomical. Buffet breakfast was great with a wide selection of cooked items (including eggs benedict), pastries, cold meat, cheeses and fruit.

The hotel is located in the Powerscourt estate, directly opposite a golf course. The hotel grounds are small and not particularly attractive but it is certainly worth walking for 5 minutes up to Powerscourt house which has beautiful grounds (admission charge of EUR8 per adult). It would be nice if the hotel arranged an agreement with Powerscourt to allow hotel guests into the gardens without charge.

So, overall, a good stay with pleasant staff and comfortable surroundings. Not quite the attention to detail that I have found when staying in Peninsula hotels but a good choice nevertheless. Just wish they'd cut the pretence of asking about birthdays.",4,2009,04,20
217,Quite Brilliant,"I have reviewed the RC Powerscourt before. It was very good then - with areas that could be tweaked to make the hotel perfect - well they tweaks have been tweaked and our recent two day stay was simply wonderful.

We stayed in room 246 - a magnificent 2nd floor mountain view suite with seperate kitchen, sitting room, guest WC, dressing area and spectacular bathroom. We also had a very nice covered balcony which was perfect given it rained for two days solid. 

Initially we were only staying for a surprise one night but everything was so good we ended up staying a second night.......very recessionary minded indeed!

The highlights.......Breakfast is now first class. Great buffet - actually one of the best ive had - with attentive service from really nice staff that have been with the hotel since day one.  The spa and pool must be quite simply the best in ireland. Service in the sugarloaf lounge has become much more refined without being stuffy - try the frito misto and a glass of champagne! Room service has tightened up considerably also - quick and professional. (Basically what you would expect from a hotel of this class but in the past the RC Powerscourt fell down somewhat in this area)

All in all we had a fantastic break and cant wait to return!",5,2009,04,16
217,Wonderfull,"We stayed in the Ritz for my husbands birthday.  We chose the Gordon Ramsey package.  From start to finish we could not have been happier.  The check-in staff wished my husband a Happy Birthday.  We were shown to and around our wonderful suite by a very friendly guy.  The room is fantastic.  A marble bathroom with tv in the mirror, walk in closet, fantastic huge bed, lovely large balcony, flat screen tv mini bar etc.  We did not want to even leave the room.  There were complimentary chocolates and a birthday card in the room on arrival.

The pool and jacuzzi, sauna area was very nice and relaxing.  The changing rooms are spotless.  The only thing I thought was it would have been nice to have a couple of windows to view the wonderful scenery outdoors.  The spa treatments were very expensive and as we were only staying one night, we didn't want to be confined to the spa.

Lunch in the sugarloaf was nice and staff very friendly. They would converse or leave you in peace whichever you desired.  I thought it was slightly overpriced but it is the Ritz.

Dinner in Ramsays was wonderful from start to finish.  At first it was a little uncomfortable as we were slightly overwhelmed by an over abundance of staff.  Thankfully this settled down though.  The whole experience of the meal was sublime.  I would have enjoyed a bit of carbohydrate i.e. potato with my main course of sea bass and there wasn't any side orders on the menu, I didn't like to ask.  However, I did not go hungry.  There was the most wonderful selection of cheeses and a lengthy wine list for every budget.

After dinner we had a drink in the Irish bar however it was very quiet and we ended up just going back to the room.  We didn't mind as we were full from dinner but I woud say there isn't any atmosphere, that night anyway.

We ordered room service breakfast.  There is an option for every budget here too, you do not have to go for the €350 option.  This arrived promptly and fresh and again more friendly staff.

All in all it was wonderful, we did not want to leave.  My only grievance is that my stay was too short.  I would definitely go back and recommend it to anyone.",5,2009,04,14
217,"Great location, but be aware of extra charges","We stayed here for 3 nights in April and found a welcoming staff who were exemplary. Our room was upgraded to a mini-suite, without request. The country ambience was a little offset due to the loud noise of fans operating at the front of the hotel. The fan in our bathroom kept going too. We booked our stay via the internet, but could not find any reference to a charge for breakfast, so we were surprised to see an addition to our bill, of €58 per day [per room] for a buffet breakfast. At this price, we would have expected a 'cooked-to-order' breakfast - in keeping with the standard of other locations of this type in Ireland.",4,2009,04,13
217,Fan-tas-tic & Lux-ur-ious FAB!,"What a Hotel! What a location!

I brought my wife here for her birthday for 2 nights and we stayed in a mountain view suite.  The suite was on the top floor and was pure class, elegance at its finest! The view was amazing from the massive balcony of the beautiful mountains and surrounding area.  The suite was equiped with stunning antique furniture and the latest in technology and very comfortable seating areas and a stunning bed that I am still dreaming about.  The bathroom was huge with a classy built in TV in the mirror above his and hers sink.  The complimentaries were BVLGARI products which included hand cream, shower gel, shampoo, soap & conditioner.

Outside of the suite that is fit for royalty the hotel itself has a great Irish Bar that has TV for sports and a massive selections of beers, wines and spirits.  They also offer a great menu, I reccomend the Guiness Irish Stew, it was delicious!
Gordon Ramsays Restaurant was fab and they have a great breakfast selection each morning.  The menu in the lobby was great and I highly reccomend the chocolate pudding with a chocolate and whiskey gooey centre, if you love chocolate you will fall in love with this 20,000 calorie packed chocolate pudding.

The pool was brill and the spa was good and the highlight with regards to recreation was definatley the walk around powerscourt.

I highly reccomend this hotel, It has been the nicest hotel that I have ever stayed in any where I have travelled in the world.",5,2009,04,11
217,reall nice stay,"stayed for two nights ,what a fab location ,great staff,rooms ,spa area all top class and up there with some of the best in the world .Had dinner in gordon ramsey very nice, excellent pace and very high standard,  checkout very swift by ciarian a very plesant guy from wales top marks to the hotel .",5,2009,04,05
217,Stay Away for Vacation Purposes,"We stayed at this hotel because of a wedding we were attending and the fact it was a new Ritz Carlton!! First off, this is a lovely hotel but needs more things to do and service needs major improving! Lets start off with the positives: 
1) the wedding: a fantastic venue, a spacious ballroom with excellant food for the event. 
2) Gordon Ramsay: a wonderful dinner, went here twice! It was just fantastic both times. Service was ok but the beautiful dining room and outstanding food made up for it! Breakfast was ok but buffet and kept rather cold we went down (at 10am). 
3) ESPA: one of the best spas I have been to. Great service and fantastic treatments. I had a facial, 60 minute Aromatherapy Massage and Balinese Massage as well. The swimming pool and relaxation room facilities (tropical and arctic pools) are just  great!!!! 
4) Lastly, the Powerscourt  Golf Club with two 18 hole courses were great. We played each once and while thorougly enjoyed both, preferred the newer West Course to the East. 

Now, the negatives. We stayed here for one week. There is nothing to do after Spa treatments and golf! The food in McCabe's Pub and Sugar Bar are extremely overpriced! The Afternoon Tea in Lobby Lounge is decent but I have had much better for 50 Euros per person. The service in this hotel was awful. From front desk to Concierge and housekeeping. Room service always took forever. The room itself while pretty and new and spacious, had major water issues in the bathroom and window leakage. 

Would never go back unless family event held at the hotel.",3,2009,03,28
217,"Beautiful hotel, friendly staff but hostile extras & checkout","I rely heavily on Tripadvisor reviews when booking trips myself so will try to give an accurate and objective view of our stay which might help others when looking at this hotel.

Check-in:
Friendly bellboy opened the car door for us and helped with all the luggage which we found very efficient. We arrived just after the specified check-in time excited to see our room and explore the hotel, however our room was not yet ready, the lady at reception coldly ""told"" us to wait in the sugarloaf lounge and she would phone us when the room would be ready - we thought it was quiet strange that no offer of a complementary coffee / drink was offered while we waited - no big deal, but just odd for a 5 star.

20 minutes later we got a call and proceeded to pick up our room keys from reception, a very nice employee walked us to our room and explained the hotel layout (otherwise confusing), our room controls (digital touch-pads built into the walls) and the hotel dining options. Our bags where waiting for us in our room.

Room:
We had a garden view suite which was huge, massive comfy beds, walk in closet, beautiful white marble bathrooms and loads of gadgets to toy around with. The color scheme was a light green which to us looked dated  even though the hotel is only 2-3 years old, I think the industry term is ""classic luxury"" rather than modern and chic - this style is repeated though out the hotel. Some joker had set our bedside alarm to go off a 6am on a Sunday morning - should of been checked & reset when the room was cleaned.

Food:
We found food and drinks to be extremely overpriced throughout the hotel, I know its a 5 star and going to be expensive but at 6 euro for a bottle of Heineken -  we found this to be a complete a bit much. 

The Irish themed bar had friendly & very professional staff and good atmosphere. The menu here is virtually identical to that of the sugarloaf lounge menu (we had both side-by-side) but everything is 3-6 euro less expensive for the same items.

In room dining is crazy, 350 EUR for breakfast for two people in the room with a tiny bottle of generic champagne - absolutely over the top. Luckily we breakfast included with our stay, this is buffet style only in the Gordon Ramsey restaurant. Personally I found the selection excellent and the quality of the food to be very high, my wife asked if the chef could prepare  eggs benedict was informed the chef was busy and this would cost extra to prepare (server was not sure of how much extra so we gave it a miss).

Leisure:
The pool and sauna / steam room was world class, very relaxing, nice stone floors and walls with great power showers. The jacuzzi has a series of mental pipes arranged in the shape of a recliner on which you lye back on and though which very fine air bubbles are emitted - simply superb!

The gym is basic with 4 treadmills, some weights machines and a few exercise bikes - nothing extravagant, but all I needed for a morning workout. Not sure how they justify the 4500 euro a year membership fee though. One note here, the in room guest information booklet states the gym is open 24 hours, however it actually does not open until 7 am - probably not a major issue however for most people. 

Checkout:
This was the low point of our stay as the lady at reception tried to charge us 30 euro for an extra breakfast that morning (my wife's cousin was staying with us). We had booked a suite for 3 people on their website and selected a package which included breakfast - despite specifying that 3 people where staying it seems the rate they show only includes breakfast for 2 people but this is not specified anywhere nor where we informed at the hotel / at breakfast - how people are supposed to know this is still a mystery. When we disputed this charge we where coldly informed that this is their policy and we must pay immediately, I then had to demand to see a manager, explained the situation again but she did not want to hear it. When I told her objectively that I was going to refuse to pay the extra change because we where never informed in advance and certainly would not have paid such a rip-off price for a single breakfast did she concede and remove the charge and disappeared back to her office without any word of explication. By this stage all other staff had stopped helping other clients checkout and where looking at us, motionless - not very comfortable and made us feel like we where somehow trying to cheat the hotel when they where trying to cheat us.

Overall the building is very beautiful, staff are helpful, great spa and the rooms where comfortable, we probably won't go back though as we have found equally great hotels offering much better value for money - and have up front pricing.",3,2009,03,22
217,Surprise Birthday Stay for my Husband,"I booked a Garden Deluxe Room at the Ritz Carlton, Powerscourt, Enniskerry, County Wicklow, Ireland as a surprise birthday present for my husband.  I booked one night and also a table at Gordon Ramsay.  This was a one off for us and I wanted my husband to have a well deserved treat for his special day.  We arrived and found the service to be impeccable.  The staff were friendly, professional and not snobbish at all.  We were made to feel very welcome.  Our porter was very informative, accompanied us to our room and explained all the room gadgets to us very well.  I could not fault him at all.  Our room was great, very luxurious, calming and a beautiful view overlooking the fountain and hotel gardens.  We were also lucky to have the weather on our side.  We were hoping to have a light refreshment in the room before dining in Gordon Ramsay, however, slightly disappointed that there was nothing complimentary at all in our room.  Not even a welcoming tea or coffee, and breakfast was not included.  By our standards, the refreshments in the Honour Bar were over priced.

We went down to McGills Bar, the authentic Irish Bar in the hotel, to enjoy the Wales V Ireland match.  Me being of Welsh descent and originally from England supported my side as best as I could, and my Husband being Scottish supported me with gusto.  The bar staff were very friendly and welcoming, however the punters were not.  We felt extremely unwelcome and were made to feel so.  In particular one middle aged Irish couple kept making anti-English references behind us, in earshot.  Rather than healthy competition and banter, we found the Irish supporters in our area very aggressive, rude and making sure we heard we were not welcome, to the extent that I stopped enjoying the whole game and wanted to get out of there as quidkly as possible before it spoilt our whole night.  Fortunately our table was ready at 7 and we made an exit.  Not an atmosphere I would ever like to experience again, and not the sort of behaviour I would expect from guests of The Ritz. My husband and I live locally in Bray and I embarrassed to think that any foreign guest would be treated like that when trying to enjoy their stay.

We dined in Gordon Ramsay and the whole experience was second to none.  Fantastic.  We had a wonderful table next to the floor to ceiling window, the Somelier was very knowledgable and attentive as were all the other staff.  A slight downside for us was that they were overly attentive, too much for us really.  They even offered to accompany my husband to the Gents toilets......relieved though that they did not ask to ""wipe the Royal bottom Sir?""

As were were only one couple out of a total of six customers at this point in time, we found they watched our every move, scrutinising everything.  When my husband reached for the wine they were over like a shot to serve it for him.

The food was great, delicious as expected it even exceeded our expectations.  My husband had the scallops to start followed by the loin of Wicklow beef.  I had the red pepper risotto with goats cheese, followed by the Wicklow Venison.  Each dish was explained in detail.  To finish off for the night we had Coffee Infusion with Petits Fours - very decadent.

I was looking forward to returning to the room as an extra gift I had arranged for a Romantic Turndown.  Sadly when we got into our room after 9pm it had not been done and I was bitterly disappointed.  I went to Reception who apologised profusely and took the extra cost of the turndown off the bill.  With all credit to them, they did ask if I wanted anything complimentary added to the room, but I declined as I felt nothing could compensate for what I had been expecting as an added gift for my husband.

Overall, we did have a wonderful stay and experience, one we sadly won't be able to repeat that often.  It was well worth the surprise and because of this I can forgive some of the disappointments.",4,2009,03,22
217,5 star all the way,"I've read mixed reviews about this hotel and was worried whether our stay would be hassle free and I'm glad to report it was. This hotels 5 stars are well earned.
Arrival: 
The reception staff were very professional, discreet and attentive without being overbearing. We were shown to our room by a bell boy/ porter who tried to leave before I could give him a tip. 
The Room:
Our room was on the 6th Floor and was wonderful. It ticked all of the boxes. The view of the Sugar Loaf mountain was very nice. The Balcony/ Terrace was perfect for smoking. They even provided matches. Everything in the room worked as expected. 

The Food:
What can I say, it was superb.  It was also expensive but we knew it was going to be. The wine was a bit over-priced but we also knew that would be. The cheapest bottle of wine is circa €55.  WARNING: They offer you bottled water & champagne on arrival in the restaurant, it is not FREE.
The Gordon Ramsey experience is what we went for. Well worth it. The staff were very professional, very impressive. 

The Spa:
Brilliant. The best pool & hot tub ever. The sauna/ steam room were also excellent.
The pool is around 4.5 feet deep thru-out. We didn't use any other spa facilities but did notice they were expensive. But if they are good as everything else then it's probably worth it.

Breakfast:
What can I say, I had 5 courses, 
A Fry, Yogurt, Fish, Fruit, Bread.....etc, etc.... You could eat as much as you wanted thus the price. The selection was the best I've ever seen.

Check-out:
Smooth.

Bad Things:
The air con in the room only goes from 19o.
The internet is not free.
Tips;
The free bottled water was left on our bed-side with turn down. Bring your own water and snacks etc...We brought our own wine for our room.

Overall: Expensive but worth it.",5,2009,03,12
217,Excellent Friday Night!,"Stayed here on a recent Friday night as a belated Valentine's surprise for my wife. Location and views are excellent as are the oversize rooms and service. Check in was prompt, polite and efficient. Upgraded to a corner suite with garden views. In-room facilities were excellent especially the TV recessed into the bathroom mirror - I think it took my wife the combined duration of Emmerdale, Coronation Street and Eastenders to apply the make-up!! Glad rags duly donned, we headed for Restaurant Gordon Ramsay for a sumptuous 2.5 hour dining experience. Not cheap overall, but well worth it and only a short drive from Dublin - we will be back!",4,2009,02,27
217,Least favorite of our 3 hotels,"My husband and I just returned from a 6 night stay in Ireland. We stayed at the Dromoland Castle in Co. Clare, The Kingsley in Cork City, and the Ritz Carlton Powerscourt in Wicklow. We found the ritz to be snobbish, and not very accomodating. They do not even let you use the internet in the hotel for free. You have to pay. Also, we ate a at the restaurant, and the food was not good, and very over priced. They seem like they are trying too hard. The staff tries to be helpful, but in a very forced, over the top way that makes you feel uncomfortable. On the flip side, our room had a balcony facing the mountains and it was beautiful, the room was very nice, with a TV in the mirror in the bathroom. Very fancy. As for our other 2 hotels, they were fabulous! Dromoland feels like a fairytale and The Kingsley is they ultimate in casual luxury.",2,2009,02,27
217,I Loved this Hotel!,"Just spent Saturday 21st in this hotel, celebrating with another couple.  It really is a nice hotel, we had been treated to a complimentary upgrade to a junior suite which was just fab. The size of the room! The size of the bed! The silence in the room! The size of the bathroom! The TV in the bathroom mirror! The crystal ring holder on the bathroom shelf!  The walk-in wardrobe!  The SIZE of the terrace! I could go on and on...

The staff were very helpful and courteous.  The leisure centre was lovely, the pool a bit too warm and not conducive to swimming for a workout.  I think the bar was a bit too dark, olde Oirish and certainly over priced - I didn't like it.  

But my biggest gripe was the Gordon Ramsey restuarant.  We just didn't get it - not the huge prices (expected), not the tiny portions (expected) not the limited menu (not expected) and not the warm, bland food that was served up to us (definitely not expected).  Our drinks order turned into a farce, we were brought a drink of liqueur and champagne and were treated to a rigamarole as to the origin of the drink and we were too embarrassed to ask why we were getting these drinks rather than the beers we had ordered.  When there was no sign of the beers, we plucked up the courage to enquire why we were given these drinks?  Turned out our waiter had misunderstood us and the drinks would be on him (phew!!)  If you value your money and want value for your money, don't eat in this restaurant.

Anyway, I would still return to this hotel when I want to treat myself again - I will just give Gordon Ramsey a very wide berth - it'll be a definite  ""No, Chef"" from me!!",5,2009,02,25
217,loved it,"The moment we stepped inside this hotel we felt like we were in a different world. the rooms are spacious and well equipped. The best nights sleep in a long while! everything is so clean and neat. The staff are so helpful and are seen but not heard and completely unintrusive. The spa and pool area is of the same standard and one could spend hours just relaxing.
We ate in the bar and the food and atmosphere was good. Breakfast the next morning was a little dissappointing. I could probably have made better scrambled eggs myself ....a little more creamy would be nice. And it is a little pity that it is self service but the selection is good neverthe less.
I cannot wait to go back!",4,2009,02,23
217,Worst 5 star hotel we have stayed in!,"We stayed at the Ritz Carlton in Powerscourt for Valentine;s night and were so looking forward to it for weeks - however, we had a disastrous visit - we had booked into Gordon Ramsay's restuarant and ended up having to eat the meal in our room - we were given no choice and the food was average and portions tiny!  We had two mini main courses of pork belly and duck - not suitable for all tastes!  The service in the hotel was atrocious and we waiting several times for drinks and bills.  What was even worse was our room - bar and very white and clinical with lots of shelves with nothing on them, our mini bar was broken and so was our air-conditioning was also broken - not what one expects from a 5 star hotel!  We had to call twice about both the mini bar and aircon and neither were resolved of fixed.  When we checked out, we had to wait in line for nearly half an hour - we complained and got a 50% discount, so instead of paying €410 for a room with dinner and breakfast (not exactly a bargain!), we paid €205 for what I would say was a snack in our room, bed and breakfast in a room that was too hot with no cold drinks!! (still not a bargain!).  We are never going back!!!",1,2009,02,22
217,Great place!,"I had to go here with work, and wasn't too keen to go, but on arrival i was happily surprised!  The hotel was amazing - a bit cumber some to look at, but the rooms, service, views and spa were amazing and luckily i did get to use the pool.  Went swimming at 7 oc'clock in the morning and it was beautiful as i was on my own and it was dead chilled.

My room was fab - but who needs two bathrooms!  I also felt the rooms were rather warm, and it was tricky to get the room cool, but it was lovely!",5,2009,01,27
217,Expect the best and to pay for it,"My wife and I stayed for a 2  night weekend break in a mountain view suite.  We had a late arrival on a Frday night, reception was good and bellhop was very helpful and informative. '

We had a room service dinner, which was superb. From arranging to have the courses brought up seperately to helping to select a nice wine, this was the best room service I have ever received and the food was great.

The rooms are very high spec and large. The bed, the walk-in closet, the bathroom all met our expectations. We read reviews indicating problems wiht AC and heating, we found them to be fine. The rooms are completely sound proof and the balconies are nicely done and very usable. We got the complete rest and unwind that we wanted.

We had dinner at the Gordon Ramsay restaurant and we got what we paid for (which was alot). Food superb, wines excellent and service the best.  Oh yeah and the bill was large, but I'm not complaining.

The total weekend was a great success it was what we hoped for and expected for the money we paid. If you stay here expect the best and to pay for it.",5,2009,01,18
217,Excellent,"We have just returned from a weeks stay at the hotel.

Firstly I mention the staff, who were excellent. Each and every one of them was friendly and went out of their way to be helpful. We have stayed at a number of Ritz Carlton hotels and their employees are a credit to the organisation - they are ""head and shoulders"" above staff at the majority of other five star hotels we have stayed in.

The hotel is in a stunning location, both the public rooms and bedrooms are finished to a very high standard.

The Spa and pool area are fantastic.

The dining experience in the Gordon Ramsey restaurant was first class and in line with the very best restaurants in the UK.

As mentioned by a previous reviewer, there was a problem at breakfast on a couple of mornings - this seemed to be as a result of so many people arriving at one time. Although not ideal, the problem was dealt with quickly and efficently- we had to wait no more than 10 minutes for a table. The breakfast was well presented and of high standard.

In fact, we believed that the problems at breakfast were a direct result of guests enjoying the breakfast so much, that they remained much longer than would be expected.

I believe that most hotels (5 star included) operate a buffet breakfast format - only smaller hotels offer an alternative.

We also ate in the hotel's other restaurant (The Sugar Loaf) and ""McGills"" pub, and again both the service and food were very good.

I would mention, that if you are staying at the hotel for more than 3-4 nights, the choice of dining experience is slightly limited - and possibly the hotel would benefit from perhaps extending the menu in the ""Sugar Loaf"" restaurant. 

I would recommend this hotel to anyone. All aspects of our stay were excellent and the managers and staff must take credit for this. Thank you.

217,Not disappointed on our return,"We first stayed at this hotel in September 2008 and enjoyed it so much we returned in December 2008 and were not disappointed.  The receptionist remembered us before we even gave them our name which was lovely.  Staff were super - they really went out of their way to chat to you, mountainview room was great, service was good and we really enjoyed our stay. We will be back.
One grumble - please get tea making facilities in the rooms!!",5,2009,01,05
217,New Year disappointment,"Our second visit to Powerscourt and it is a lovely hotel.

We stayed for 3 nights over the New Year  period and were very disappointed with the entertainment and general lack of atmosphere on New Year's Eve. The band was very poor and celebrating New Year in Ireland we were hoping for an Irish band, at least.
The price of a round of drinks was £36 (4 drinks), so we weren't even able to drown our sorrows!

We would return to the hotel as the rooms are luxurious, it is in a lovely location and the staff are very pleasant and helpful - just not at New Year.",4,2009,01,04
217,Confucious reigns,"Stunning vista, wonderful beds but the rest?

We visited the Hotel for New Years eve. Our first attempt at real luxury failed when we ordered two large Americanos and found they were not barista made and cost an astonishing €11.00 each! instead of being charged a €1.00 for an extra shot the bill was simply doubled. Interesting maths?

The interior is without doubt beautiful but the service level is still poor. I excused poor service on my first visit a few months after the hotel opened but a year later?

Shame because the Ritz Carton with its wondeful reputation could be a gem here in Ireland too.",4,2009,01,04
217,Dont waste your money - this is NOT a 5 star hotel!,"DO NOT WASTE YOUR MONEY STAYING AT THIS HOTEL!!!!! IT IS NOT 5 STAR OR EVEN CLOSE!!!!!!!

We booked a three night stay at this hotel to celebrate our wedding anniversary just after Christmas. This is an annual trip for us and we always choose a good 5 star hotel to help us re-charge the batteries before we embark on another hectic year. We have stayed at many fine places over the last few years with the Park Hotel Killarney and Monart standing out as exceptional experiences and value for money. Unfortunately our experience at the Ritz Carlton Powerscourt fell well below our expectations.

We arrived on Sunday afternoon to a warm welcome from the bellboy who unpacked and parked our car. We were greeted at reception by a surly receptionist who couldnt even muster a little polite conversation while we checked in. The same friendly bellboy showed us to our room (A Garden View Suite) and expalined the layout and facilities of our room and the hotel. I had informed the hotel before our arrival that we were celebrating our anniversary and within 5 minutes of arriving in our room we received a beautiful plate of strwberries and cream. I really thought we were on to a winner as the setting, the room etc all seemed of a very high standard. We spent our first evening in McGills pub and ate a nice meal in the Sugarloaf Lounge. 

The next morning we arrived at breakfast at 09:30am to be greeted by chaos. There was a line of approx 30 people stretching out of the restaruant. After battling our way to the front of the crowd we could see that a restaurant ""manager"" was sending people back to their rooms or upstairs to wait in the lobby with the promise of a call for breakfast in about 30 minutes or so. We made ourselves known and she told us to wait. After 20 minutes of standing I asked again and was told we werent on the list. After a full hour of standing and waiting around we were eventually seated at a table that was only half completed - no milk, sugar etc. The breakfast is served buffet style which is not, in my opinion, acceptable for a 5 -star hotel. This buffet was nothing remarkable and I have had similar at 3 and 4 star hotels. Breakfast the next morning was a similar affair and we were seated at a table for one which meant I had to scour the restatuant for a spare seat and move it myself and then beg for some cutlery before we could proceed with breakfast. On the third morning we got up early at 08:00 in order to avoid the stressful start to the day. 

We also used the Spa at the hotel for massages during our stay I called the Spa before we went for our treatments and was told in no uncertain terms that we MUST wear our robes from the room to the Spa - this means walking through reception past other guests and gawkers to get to the Spa - a little embarrasing. We found a posh middle aged receptionist extremely rude on arrival at the Spa. We arrived an hour before our treatments as requested and were made to feel like we were freeloaders who were hijacking the facilities!! At €200 per treatment I would have expected to be able to stay all day. The massages and therapists were excellent and the facilities good - even though male and female facilities  (whirlpool, sauna, steam room etc) are all seperate. 

On our third day at the hotel we approached reception to enquire about internet facilities to be told that we could buy a card for 15 minutes access for €5 - no free wifi in this hotel - unbelievable. I spoke to the manager and informed that our one our wait for breakfast on morning one would no doubt amply cover the cost of 15 minutes internet usage. He apologised profusely for the delay at breafast the following morning and told me we would not be charged for our breakfast on check out. I also informed reception that the electronic controls for lights and curtains in our room was broken - they promised to send an ""engineer"" to the room as soon as possible to fix the problem - nobody ever came to fix the problem.

On our last night in the hotel we went out for dinner to Johnnie Fox's pub which is about 20 minutes drive away. We had an exceptional meal here for under €100. On our return to our room at 11:30 we were disgusted to find our bed had been turned down with mud across the top of the duvet. My wife was enraged with this but we were so tired that we decided it could take the hotel up to 24 hours to even respond to such a problem that we had better just put up and shut up. We took off the dirty duvet and slept under a sheet for the night. 

On checking out we were - surprise, surprise - charged for breakfast. When I informed the receptionist that we had been told this would not happen he said that he did not have the authority to remove the charge from the bill and asked if I wanted to speak to the manager. At this stage I had argued with so many people since my arrival at the hotel that I decided to not do it again. I told the receptionist that I had so many problems during our stay that I would prefer to write a letter and asked for the address -- the receptionist didnt have this. 

The cost of our stay including meals, drinks etc was €1,800 and I feel like we were totally ripped off. The service here is not of a 5 -star standard and the hotel has a lot to learn from establishments such as the Park in Killarney. Do NOT waste your money here - it is not worth it.  I am  going to write to the manager of the hotel but, similar to other complaints made during our stay, do not expect a response.",2,2009,01,03
217,Fabulous As Expected,"This year for a treat I spent New Year's Eve at The Ritz Carlton in Powerscourt with my boyfriend. The hotel as you would imagine is incredible and really has the wow factor.
We booked the Gordon Ramsay package and upgraded to a Mountain View Suite and we were not disappointed. The suite was absolutely amazing and made the night really special. As you can see from some of the pictures on this site all rooms are extremely spacious, however, I never expected the suite to be as nice as it was. Along with a large bedroom and separate dining area, was a large kitchen, 2 bathrooms (the larger one with a tv in the mirror which was a very nice touch), a walk-in wardrobe and a double terrace over looking the Sugar Loaf. The view itself is spectacular and it was lovely to sit out and enjoy a drink before dinner.
The Gordon Ramsay restaurant is very nice although I was extremely disappointed with the set menu on New Year’s Eve as it was not to my taste. Part of the enjoyment for me is choosing my own courses, however, saying that the settling was lovely. Having viewed the usual menu I am looking forward to going back. Be careful when choosing the wine as it is hugely expensive. We chose one of the cheaper red wines at €57 a bottle and I was happy to notice quite a few tables had the same so we did not feel bad. You could pay anything up to €4000 a bottle and that is definitely out of our range! Service in the restaurant that evening was not at its best, I would imagine this comes from the restaurant not getting the expected numbers throughout the year. We had expected more from the service in a restaurant of this calibre. It seems with a full restaurant even on a set menu the kitchen couldn’t handle the numbers and we were waiting quite some time between courses. I heard one of the waiters’ apologizing to another table about the wait as they ‘were under pressure’.
Overall I had a wonderful night and the hotel is definitely a setting for a romantic getaway. I was disappointed in the atmosphere for New Year’s Eve. There was a band playing in The Sugar Loaf Lounge doing their best to get things going however the singer seemed to be having an off night as he wasn’t quite in tune with the rest of the band. It was quite funny though. I think for the prices the hotel is charging they need to be making more effort for special nights such as these. My advice would be to stay on an average week/weekend and you will not be disappointed.",4,2009,01,02
217,Good,"HOTEL AND ROOM: The hotel is a bit of a carbuncle on the landscape from the outside, but the lobby and Sugar Loaf lounge are both very nice and well decorated for Christmas. We had a 'deluxe' room which is their standard room, It was very well appointed, 6ft bed, good bathroom with separate shower, TV in the bathroom, robes, slippers, nice toiletries. Very expensive mini bar - 2.25 for a Mars bar!! Bring your own drink/snacks for a pre dinner drink in your room. The hotel is a tiny bit lacking in atmosphere. 

SPA: excellent. I had a massage that was very well done with no unecessary chit-chat. The relaxation room and the ladies thermal room/whirpool room were lovely with amazing views over the mountain. The pool and hamman were very good as well, although the pool is pretty cold.

DINNER: we ate in Resturant Gordon Ramsay. The food was very good, with lots of amuse bouche courses. The wine list was outrageously expensive - most wines were over 100euro. We got a bottle for 56euro and were not made feel like cheapskates!! 

My only complaint about the hotel is that when checking in we were not given any information about the layout of the hotel, nor did the receptionist automatically confirm our dinner or spa reservations, she also did not tell us we were on a B&B package. There was no hotel information file in the room.",4,2008,12,28
217,Suite too warm!,"We stayed in the Ritz Carlton in Sep.  On arrival we found the suite extremely warm and uncomfortable so we adjusted the air con temp in the room.  However over 30 mins later the room was still too hot to be 16 degrees as shown on the thermostat so my husband rang reception.  They sent up a maintainence man who said it takes a long time for the temp to adjust and brought us up an electricial fan!!!  We were paying 315 euros for a room so we expected a better standard.  I was 6-7 months pregnant and felt quite sick from the heat at this stage and had to have a cold shower to cool down!  Getting ready for dinner was very uncomfortable in the heat and I had to do my makeup in front of the fan!!!!!  (this is Ireland, not the Carribean!)  
On check out I asked for a comments card to fill out and complain but there were none available.  I asked for a pen and paper and wrote my complaint to the General manager in Powerscourt and left it in reception.
That was 3 months ago now and I have heard nothing back from the hotel.  I am bitterly disappointed and we would not recommend this hotel to any of out friends and family.  We paid 638 euros for one night, dinner and breakfast.  For that money we would expect a room at a comfortable temperature.",2,2008,12,21
217,Wondeful experience,"What a wonderful experience. From the moment we arrived, the valet took control of everything while a bellboy took our luggage out and brought it to our room as we checked in.
The check-in staff were very friendly and welcoming and were a mirror-image of how friendly the staff would be during our entire stay.
The room was incedible well-appointed with an enormous king-size bed, dressing room and bathroom with bath and a choice of either a conventional shower or a vertical shower. The television built in to the mirror in the bathroom was a nice touch, despite the fact that we didn't use it.
We love to walk, so used the estate estensively, and, walked in to Enniskerry. Not to be missed is Poppies cafe-bar, a wonderful gem for lunch or  a snack.
We had a couple of drinks in the Irish-themed pub on floor three which was very nice.
When it came to dinner, we opted for Gordon's Ramsay's, again on the third floor. Well, it was a beautiful experience, and very good value. We had a very nice table by the window with a beautufil view of the Sugarloaf montain. From the moment we arrived the staff were perfectly attentive to our every need. We opted for the Prestige menu which was outstanding. At only €90 I thonght it was an incredible bargain. I would strongly recommend the restaurant.
All in all, it was a great stay, the staff were incredibly friendly and welcoming.",5,2008,12,20
217,A great stay.,"I was a little anxious about this hotel as the reviews were mixed but our stay was a great one. Great hotel, staff and location. 
We requested an upgrade and this was provided, the room was fabulous, I'm lost without a tv in the bathroom at home! The staff were efficient and helpful, but perhaps some could be a little less 'efficient' and more relaxed in their interaction. This isn't a problem really just an observation.
The only downside was the pool, looked great but was too cold for me, even the hot pool was cold. 
Another thing to add, visit Poppys Kitchen in Enniskerry for lunch. A small cafe with a great selection of homemade pies, perfect on a cold day. And of course you can't miss out on Powerscourt House.
We enjoyed our time and hope to be back.",5,2008,12,04
217,Everything a five star hotel should be,"This hotel exemplifies all that a high-end hotel should be.  Fantastic, attentive service from the minute we drove up.  Room amenities are great and furnished beautifully (we had a mountian view one bedroom suite with our own patio).  Quiet, with lovely grounds, walking distance to the golf club and the Powerscourt estate.   Room service food was way above average and delivered very fast.  If I could afford to move in here I would!  Highly recommended!!!!",5,2008,12,02
217,Powerscourt with Kids,"Stayed here in Nov 08 (a Sun through Wed) with family and inlaws for mother-in-law's birthday.

We had our 2yr old and 1 month old children with us.

First of all the hotel itself is fantastic, real 1920s style opulence, I loved it.  Secondly the staff, from the moment we pulled up at the door until we pulled away to leave, they couldn't have been more helpful.

Upon seeing the age of our son, they had a mini dressing gown and slippers sent round to the room - a real winner from his point of view. 

Every staff member, without fail, during our stay took the time to say hello to him or ask him what he was doing with his toy or his armbands or whatever. He really loved it.

The swimming pool is slightly restrictive, kids only allowed in 9-10 and 3-5, although we knew this upfront and didnt affect our stay or when we wanted to use the pool.  It was quiet during our visit (at least twice we where the only people there) and noone ever came in and glared at us if we where in the pool outside of those times.

Will also echo other comments that the atmosphere in the hotel and good chat from the staff ensured I was not in anyway inhibited from asking questions.

Weather was rubbish (it was Nov) and therefore beyond the swimming pool, there is v little for them to do, however the Powerscourt estate and Wicklow hills in better conditions would offer a wealth of entertainment.  A soft play area might not hurt though?

We also got a babysitter arranged for the night we ate in Ramseys, who was an off duty receptionists who checked us in. Again, first class and my son gave her a glowing review.  We took our 1mnth old with us to Ramseys, where she behaved excellently.

Ramseys was good and we enjoyed the taster menu, but when we return (which we will) I will not go back. Just wasn't worth it.

Breakfast was v good if you get the chance order the french toast - best I have ever had.

During our stay we also had dinner at Jonnie Fox's a famous Irish pub about 10mins drive from the hotel. Best meal of the stay, well worth a visit.

Also visited Dundrum shopping centre (approx 25mins in car) and is worth a trip.

In summary, we would go back, but when kids are a little older it would need to be in summer as there is probably not a lot for them to do inside the hotel.

NB: Also played golf at the course across the road. Forgiving parkland course, thoroughly enjoyable.",5,2008,11,27
217,"Incredible luxury, but service leaves alot to be desired...","Firstly the good stuff - The room was incredible.  We booked a Mountain View suite.  The bed, furnishings etc were second to none.  among my favourites was a tv set into the bathroom mirror, so you could have a fab bath and watch a movie - total relaxation.  The other big plus was the spa area.  it was really beautiful.  Heated beds by the pool.  we brought the papers, and spent the day by the pool, reading, and hopping in and out for swims.  fantastic....

however... service left alot to be desired.  nice staff, friendly and helpful, but there was attention to detail missing.  just not as efficient as you would expect for the money.  Food wise, it was OK.  Don't go to the Gordon Ramsey Restaurant.  it is ok, and OK is just not good enough for the prices you pay.  The Sugar Loaf lounge food is nicer, and cheaper!

the other big no no was the bar.  called 'McGills' - it is a twee, leprechaun artificial bar, really horrible.  can't get my head around it.  seemed so out of place.

the beauty of the weekend we found was that we live in dublin, so it only took us a half hour to get there, and the same back.    hope this review helps.",3,2008,11,25
217,Luxury,"Stayed here from the 15th November to the 17th November 2008 in room 350 at a rate of €315 per night for two to include valet parking.

Location

Set on the Powerscourt Gardens this is the idela place to relax and unwind. Just 20km from Dublin City this is the idela place to get away from it all. With views to the mountains in the distance you have to pay that bit extra to get a mountain view. It's also a walk to the Golf course and close to the Powerscourt Waterfall and all it's nature walks.

The Greeting

Met at the front door by very friendly staff who took our car keys and luggage and assured us our luggage would be left in the room and our car would be parked in the car park for us. We arrived at 3:15pm and had said we would arrive at 3pm but i room wasn't ready. We weren't bothered by this as we were in awe at the lobby and just wanted to sit there all day. The receptionist gave us a letter to get a free drink each but to be honest we bought our own tea and coffee and one wine and a Heineken as we were in care free mode! On that note a tea and coffee is €11. At 4pm a member of staff met us in Gills bar and gave us our keys. We were in no rush and sat in the bar for another two hours soaking up the atmosphere and eating our fish of the day, chips and peas!

The room

Huge terrace and an even bigger room with walk in wardrobe, curtains were electronically controlled and there was a tv in the mirror in the bathroom. No complaints about the room and if i was to really point out one it would be that the TV in the bedroom itself should be placed at the end of the bed rather than in corner of the room. At 7pm a knock on our door and were given strawberrys and cream as a welcome so we opened champagne (€42) from the well stocked mini bar. Room is very warm even though you can adjust the controlls from electonic panels on the wall and from electronic panels in your bedside locker.

What to do

Excellent spa and swimming pool even if treatments are overpriced. Go for long walks in the Powerscourt Gardens (€6 each) or visit the waterfall (€5 each). Drive to Bray or to the local village or go to the city for a day shopping.

Ramseys Restaurant

Food good. Asked for a wondow season but we were looking at the wall! I like a restaurant with low lighting but this has not. Its open plan so i personnally don't like this as everyone talks low as they know everyone can here them talk. It's also where you have breakfast so to be honest not impressed by the setting but the food is good. Bill was €280 for two to include a €78 bottle of wine. Overall won't eat in Ramseys again only due to the setting been poor. Didn't drink the €6500 bottle of wine and even heard a person beside me ringing the Four Seasons in Dublin were they stayed the night before to confirm that they paid €800 for the same bottle.

Overall

It's not cheap but staff go out of their way to help you. 
Advise i would give is to separte where the dinner and breakfast are served or revamp the restaurant as the mood in the restaurant is not helped by the open lan and the bright lights.

Would i go back, yes i would",5,2008,11,19
217,Going back as soon as possible,"This is what a luxurious, relaxing break is all about. Too often a hotel will be gorgeous and the service apalling, or vice versa.

The Ritz carlton in Powerscourt has it all- luxurious accommodation and superb  service. I stayed here worth 2 of my boys for 4 nights at the end of October. I booked 2 ""enliven the senses "" packages -which included bed, breakfast for 4 nights in a one bedroom suite, dinner for 2 in ramseys on 2 nights,and 2 treatments of 1 hour.
The room was large and spacious- large bedroom; sitting area with business desk in one corner; bathroom with separate toilet, bath and shower; lovely robes and amenities;a walk-in wardrobe as big as the bathroom.  My boys could not believe that there were 3 televisions- one in the mirror in the bathroom. Brushing teeth was not an issue during our stay!
We had breakfast in our room some mornings and in the dining room on others. It was incredible. Dinner in Ramseys was fine- beautiful fish. Again, the service was absolutely impeccable and the views over the Sugarloaf were splendid. The Ramsey experience is long and full of extra bits and pieces, so make sure that you are hungry!!  Again, my children could choose from the children's menu. I was very impressed that I was not charged for the extra child's meal.I appreciate that 2 dinners were included in my package, and that 2 childrens meals would never add up to the same as i adult meal. However, there are many places that would just tell you that the package is the package, and any deviation incurs a cost. So- well done to the Ritz on this small point. We also had lunch at Ramseys- very enjoyable; and a couple of meals in the Sugarloaf, which were great. Many thanks to Annie, who was especially pleasant.
I thoroughly enjoyed the spa experience. I had a massage and a pedicure. Both visits were preceded by a trip to the lovely thermal suite. The only things I would have liked here were some water to drink ,and a clock, so that one wouldn't lose track of time and miss an appointment.The relaxation room was great as one was shielded from those around. There was fruit and water and plentiful reading material.
The swimming pool had limited hours for children, but I have no problem with that as, when I am away from my 6, I do not want to see others chasing around!! The pool is very spectacular- my boys said it was like swimming under the stars. The area is dimmed, with chairs and beds around the pool. We loved it.
Whilst the hotel did not have any activities for the children, mine were happy to watch movies, walk around the gardens at Powersourt and visit Dundrum. It snowed while we were there and I could only imagine how magical this hotel would be at Christmas. 
The staff were probably the most amazing I have come across in this country. In many of the higher class hotels there can be a sense of not wanting to ask a question for fear of being scoffed at. To ask a question regarding money/ package entitlements etc can often bring a look intimating that it is vulgar to speak of such things. The Ritz carlton has, somehow, managed to deal with this sensitive area very well. Not only did I feel able to ask anything I wanted, I felt ENCOURAGED to ask. This was a first for me, and something I won't forget in a hurry. Particular thanks to Eileen at reception.
You will note from my other reviews that I am somewhat of a nitpicker. I do not object to paying for a service, but my goodness I expect to receive it.My expectations were met and exceeded on this occasion. I cannot wait to go back!",5,2008,11,15
217,Absolutely Fantastic,"Words cannot describe the opulance that awaits you in this fantastic hotel.  While one always expects top service from the Ritz Carlton I was overly-pleased by everything offered to me during my stay.

I stayed overnight on the Gordon Ramsay dining package and what value for money it is. €400 for a fantastic meal for two and overnight accommodation in a suite that's over 750 sq. ft.  Without doubt the best value for money package I've stayed on.

As previously stated the meal was flawless.  I had eaten the previous Friday in Thontons in Dublin which has a Michelin star and the food wasn't half as good as Gordon Ramsays.  The meal was flawless (well perhaps my dessert could have been better but i'm just nit-picking).  The room was the best i've ever stayed in with every possible luxury imaginable. Indeed the walk-in-wardrobe was bigger than some rooms I've stayed in!.  The location is one of the most breath-taking in Ireland and the view from the balcony was fantastic.

I need to stop writing this review as I'm running out of superlatives.

I would highly recommend the Gordon Ramsay package but take any excuse to stay in this wonderful hotel",5,2008,10,30
217,Fabulous long weekend break,"We were off to a great start from arrival at the hotel - we had booked a garden view suite but were upgraded to a fabulous mountain view suite - which had its own huge terrace and lovely views of the sugar loaf mountain. The suite was the most luxurious we have stayed in anywhere - and we have stayed n some really nice hotels including Ritz Carlton in Orlando earlier this year - which was great too but this suite was huge, beautifully furnished .The bathroom was truly amazing and well thought out- large, separate loo and very large shower with both rain effect and separate hand held shower, heated floor and marble and mirrored floor to ceiling, tv was part of and yes i mean part of the mirror over the sinks and luxurious bulgari products were in plentiful supply - I couldn't dream of anything better!!! A pale pink robe as well as slippers were provided for our four year old little girl who was delighted . to be treated like mummy and daddy.
The food was delicious particularly the breakfasts and the bistro in the lobby area. Afternoon tea was also a real treat and there was a very buzzy atmosphere in the hotel on both saturday and sunday afternoons. We were a little disappointed by Gordon Ramseys restaurant - having eaten in his Claridges restaurant there was no comparison. The restaurant here was very like any formal dining in a five star hotel both in atmosphere and food. Everything was just fine but just not great not a very enjoyable experience .
The pool area and spa were great and very luxurious. I had a really good body massage with a body polish added in complimentary.
The staff bar the sommelier in Gordon Ramseys were so efficient and friendly. They all remembered our daughters name and made a big fuss of her.Two disney books were given to her by diffrerent staff members - a very nice and memorable touch.
Our only criticsm of the hotel is that it really is geared for adults only in that there are no facilities for children - no kids club, library, tennis courts or open tv area. The hours children can be in the pool are also very restricted..
The immediate gardens of he hotel are not great but it is on the grounds of powerscourt  which has amazing gardens.
We were thoroughly relaxed leaving the hotel andwould most certainly return sooner rather than later.",5,2008,10,28
217,Quite an experience,"I absolutely loved the size, cleanliness and bed in our suite, however was not keen on our lovely view over the car-park (garden view as it was called), the cold showers, or the prices for things within the hotel, which I feel are far too expensive.

I noted in previous reviews about the lack of tea & coffee making facilities and no complimentary drinking water - these are definately a pain and so somewhat take away fromt he experience. Als the tvs are sooooo slow to change channels and it is very frustrating trying to flick through channels.

The breakfasts are lovely, although i do believe the cooked breakfast is cooked in butter...and is too rich.

The pool area is absolutely beautiful and the gym is excellently equipped. The location of the hotel and the area in which it is located is so beautiful.

I would go again, as a major treat!!! :)",4,2008,10,20
217,Irish luxury,"We booked our stay through WhataHotel who got us an upgrade to a Mountain View suite. Thanks to them.
The Hotel is pure luxury, not cheap but absolutely delightful. Strongly recommend it to all. Beware of taxi fare from Dubliun Airport (100 Euros!) . We will return. Couldn't find one fault with the hotel or staff!! Amazing place.",5,2008,10,19
217,Great spa area. Lovely surroundings.,"Style. Grand, corniced ceilings, brass & glass, old fashioned style to American tastes.

SPA: Very nice indeed. Very contemporary.

Staff: friendly, helpful, efficient throughout. 

Children: Very restricted use of the pool but staff will oblige if the area is not too busy

Dinner. Ate in the lounge. Adults meals were nice. Children’s meals were bland, service: Very good.

Gordon Ramsey restaurant – didn’t try it. Since he has never cooked there and I read somewhere that the (current) chef did not train under him I cant see the point. Just a name surely?.

Breakfast: good quality but a standard cooked breakfast all the same. Self service down to the toast. I preferred to be served at the table. No other menu optioned on offer. Ironic how a humble B&B offers a better breakfast service than many of these 5 star places. 

The building: Beautiful to behold.
The surrounding area: Gorgeous Hilly Woodland.

Price of food & drinks: OK for 5 star 
Price of accommodation: At time of writing they’re adjusted downwards thanks to the recession but still well over €200 (that’s the attainable limit I try to keep to out of season) on a quiet night. 

Haggle-ability: Fairly stiff. No budging on the cheapest price. No complimentary plonk. Yes to comp. upgrade subject to availability.  

Ambience: Quiet as with most top of the range hotels.

Freebies: some smoothies and buns for the kids. Free Valet Parking. Alas no complimentary newspaper.

Gadgets: TV in the bathroom mirror plus remote control lights.. Air con, etc all worked perfectly. 

Improvements: Live music,  eg piano player perhaps. 

Worth the 5 stars: Of course..",4,2008,10,13
217,Great hotel,"We stayed at the Ritz Carlton Powerscourt for a relative's wedding. We only stayed one night but from the initial greeting at the door, staff were friendly, helpful and available.

We had a lovely room, probably one of the best hotel rooms I have ever stayed in, and our wedding meal was just superb. The whole ambience was just right.

We enjoyed the continental breakfast next morning while overlooking the lovely Wicklow Hills. The Continental breakfast was a bit pricey but we looked on it as a one-off experience and enjoyed it very much. Only one slight moan about that was the fact that they did not bring you a pot of tea or coffee and you constantly had to harrass the waitress to top you up.

The actual grounds of the hotel are OK but the gardens at nearby Powerscourt are superb.

There are a number of gadgets in the hotel room which basically someone of senior years is probably not interested in, and our radio in the bathroom managed to start itself in the middle of the night, a point noted by a previous guest in the review section. So they obviously have not got that one sorted out.

Apart from that I could not fault the hotel. It is rather large however, and as a disabled guest I did have a few problems finding the way out into the grounds, but eventually we did it via a number of lifts and out through the gym!

So an enjoyable visit and a great place for a wedding reception.",4,2008,10,07
217,"Worth it for a special occasion-too expensive for ""just a weekend""","We just returned yesterday after purchasing the ""Ramsay Experience"" which I thought was pricey but it was for a special occasion, however after experiencing the prices in the hotel, the one night B & B and Ramsay restaurant package isn't bad.

This hotel provides proper & expected 5* service which is so hard to find nowadays.  Like others, we were met on arrival, our car was taken from us and parked, the reception staff are exceptionally friendly, especially Elizabeth.  The package includes upgrade to a suite which was beautiful, oppulent style with modern touches and extremely large.  Tea/Coffee facilities were definitely missing, we had no slippers in our rooms, it was provided immediately upon calling housekeeping.  We travelled with another couple and even they too had to ring housekeeping, none of us could find the hairdryer so we weren't alone.  For anyone else, stand at the bathroom sink and look right and left in the mirror.  I was expecting a jacuzzi in the bath but sadly none - perhaps its for higher graded rooms only.
We came down to try afternoon tea which disappointingly and annoyingly was booked out.  We had this in the Penninsula in Hong Kong recently which is famous and a tourist attraction.  Non-residents had to queue and residents were taken immediately.  I was extremely annoyed that residents were not catered for perhaps in another room.  The waitress went to no end of trouble and length!! to explain how specially prepared this tea is (which considering they couldn't accommodate us, I wasn't really interested).  Upon booking, the hotel should inform guests that this needs to be booked in advance. But that's my only gripe.

We went for the 6 course tasting menu in Ramsays which can only be utilised if everyone at your table chooses.  Normal price is 90 per person.  It was extremely good (won't say mind blowing) and an experience well worth trying.  The wine is very experience like previous report said - about 50 quid a bottle.  The staff in Ramsays are exceptional, excellent 5* star service.

The breakfast buffet was excellent but for this calibre of hotel, I would expect a breakfast menu, not a buffet.

I would agree with another poster, their lunch/drink facilities are extremely small.  As the lounge was taken up with afternoon tea, and the bar area is very small and uninspiring beside it, the only other option was for us to go down to McGills Irish Pub.  I didn't come to this callibre of hotel to sit in a dark yet authentic Irish pub.  We were looking for something light or a sandwich but this was our only option.  Two sandwiches, fish/chips, hamburger and 4 alcoholic drinks came to 101 euro - considering the surroundings, it was a ridiculous price but we'd only arrived, were tired and hungry and didn't want to order room service.  Here we were with exquisite scenery stuck in this place - not good.

All in all, the staff were exception, the food was extremely good, yes the prices are high but a thoroughly memorable experience and yes I would go back and recommend it.",5,2008,10,06
217,Ramsey restaurant - Emperor's New Clothes,"I am giving the hotel 1 star because of the experience my wife and I had in it's over priced and over rated restaurant, plus the pub in the hotel.

 I can't say enough about the staff and the hotel itself. I really enjoyed the stay as a whole but I cannot get over the restaurant and pub.

#1 The pub-

Far too small for a hotel of this size - we were like sardines in the place due to a wedding and a conference. It seats roughly 40 people in a massive hotel (ridiculous).

#2 The restaurant-

I was really looking forward to this meal. I am a big fan of Gordon Ramsay on the tv and wanted to see if this restaurant could ""walk the walk"" so to speak. My wife's starter (Veal) was the size of a chicken mc nugget ,which was beautifully presented for the princely sum of nearly €30. My starter was the lobster ravioli which if you offered it to me free I would now decline, again approx €30. Main courses were again very very average. I paid nearly €50 for an ok fillet steak. How can you go wrong with a steak!!! The wine list was a joke with the cheapest €46, we choose one for €55 as I liked that particular wine.

All in all the meal came to €200 not including dessert- they weren't getting anymore of our money. 

I enjoy a nice meal and am in no way a philistine in these matters, I just cannot get over people who would regularly pay over €200 for such a poor meal. I sat there waiting all evening for a revolution, or someone just to say how ridiculous the food vs price was. In the end we laughed it off, we now know how the other half eat, how disappointing for them.

As I said earlier the hotel itself is great and I would return (breakfast exceptional) but I would never set foot in the restaurant again.

I would say one thing to any visitors contemplating coming to Dublin in the future.

We live in Portmarnock and regularly go out for nice meals in the area. If you are in the Skerries area (North County Dublin), you need to visit the ""Stoop your Head"" restaurant there. I can honestly say we have eaten there on many occasions and have yet to experience anything less than a fantastic meal. Gordon Ramsay hang your head in shame.",1,2008,10,02
217,Private Balcony with a Fantastic View!,"We were first met by the valet, who greeted us with a warm welcome, as he opened the front doors for us.  From this point on, everyone seemed happy to greet us and were more than willing to go the extra step.  We were escorted to, and given a tour of, our room.  My husband and I were immediately drawn to the fantastic view from our private balcony! The bed looked just as comfortable as it proved to be.  The pool was amazing.  When you are laying on one of the cusioned lounge chairs, and you look at the pool from that angle, it appears as if you are looking at the night sky with the stars shining brightly (the crystal lights). The main reason we booked this hotel was because of Gordon Ramsey's restaurant.  The food was just as supurb as we expected it to be.  It was such a surprise when we were given a tour of the kitchen and an autographed photo of Chef Ramsey!  This really made our stay such an event.  The next morning we awoke to fantastic eggs benedict and coffee.  When we checked out, we were greeted in that same kind manner that we were met with, the night before.  It was a great stay and we will go again, if we find our way back to Ireland someday",5,2008,09,29
217,Hotel now up to 5 star mark!,"We stayed in the Ritz for two nights in early August. This was our second time staying at the hotel - our first time was at a wedding soon after it opened - and were delighted to see that all of the early teething problems we had experienced appeared to have been ironed out (in particular check in and check out). 

This meant that we could really enjoy the stay. The hotel itself is pretty incredible. The guest rooms are very big and have everything from incredibly comfy beds to a flat screen TV in the loo! The common areas are also perfectly finished, especially the lounge (highly recommend the afternoon tea!) and the swimming pool area. One strange thing is that not all the lifts go to every floor, but it doesnt take long to work this out. 

We ate one night in Ramsey's - top quality - and another in Enniskerry village. The coffee shop in Powerscourt House, just a stroll from the hotel, is a great spot for lunch, while the gardens in the house are well worth a look.

Staff were very attentive, but without being annoyingly so!

All in all a very enjoyable, relaxing stay.

217,"Beautiful Room, great service, a couple quirks","We stayed at the Ritz Carlton Powerscourt for the last three nights of a ten day trip to Ireland.  It's truly a lovely property and the service is mostly what you'd expect from a Ritz Carlton.
Check-in was fast and efficient and friendly, but unlike most RC's where I've stayed, no one greeted us at our car when we arrived. No big deal, just different than usual RC treatment.
Our room was large and very nicely decorated.  The bathroom is the typical marble RC bath, large and with yummy-smelling Bulgari amenities.  Love the RC bathrobes as well. The dressing room between the bathroom and  bedroom area was bigger than most, and the closets are stocked with the necessities, iron, shoe shine kit, safe, umbrella, etc.  The king-sized bed, which I've always found to be true at RC's, was heavenly. 
I was disappointed that, unlike the 5 previous hotels or B&B's we stayed during this trip, there was no in-room coffee and tea service.  Strange for any room in Ireland.  The mini-bar is fully stocked of course.
The room has digital touch screen controls for curtains, lights and climate, and our A/C wasn't working when we arrived.  However, we called the desk and someone was in the room checking on it within 20 miniutes.  It happened again our the third day but was corrected quickly again.  That's one of the quirks we encountered. The other was that on our first night there, the water pressure for cold began to sputter and brown water came out! Ew. We were told by the desk that ""that sometimes happens in Ireland"" and to let it run for 5 minutes and it would stop, which it did, but it was still kind of gross.
Dinner at Gordon Ramsey's was elegant and delicious. The service was impeccable and the courses were perfectly timed. The sommelier was very knowledgeable and made perfect pairings for our meals.
Dinner, lunch and  breakfast at Sugarloaf Lounge were good as well.  Breakfast was a buffet (not sure if that was weekend only) and had everything one could wish for in a buffet. You definitely need reservations there on weekends for dinner, even if staying at the hotel. We saw several people get turned away.  The view is just lovely with the mountains in the distance.
ESPA, the spa, is fabulous and I recommend a massage with Racquel.
The concierge was very helpful with maps, suggestions and a few historical nuggets and stories.
There is no little shop in this RC in case you need any extras. We had to go into Bray (15 min drive) to get a disposable camera when we used up all the memory cards we brought with ours.
Overall, a great way to end our wonderful excursion to Ireland. I hope they get the A/C issue and water problems taken care of, which are likely a result of it being a new building. We'll be back.",4,2008,09,11
217,Loved The Ritz - Wonderful from start to finish,"We very slightly nervous what with some of the reviews posted but we had a wonderful night at the Ritz and enjoyed every minute.

Our room was on the second floor and had a balcony over looking the grounds, absolutely gorgeous and really large.  No problem with the electronics (lights etc) I would have gladly moved in!

We ate in the bar, famous for its fish and chips and that did not disappoint - so tasty....  Had drinks upstairs then in the foyer and went for a short walk into the Secret Garden to get some air.  Really pretty.

Stayed on in the Residents Bar until late and then sat on our balcony sipping champagne after.  total bliss.

Breakfast was fantastic, wonderful service by everyone - throughout our trip they could not have done more for us but but were never intrusive.  Great selection of hot food, fruit, breads, muffins, juices....yummy!

At check out we were told that we could use the facilities of the spa throughout the day so we went down then and enjoyed a swim in the lovely pool. 

We will certainly be returning to The Ritz, we thought it was wonderful value, tip top service by very friendly staff, great setting, brilliant food and therefore had a terrific night!!",5,2008,08,31
217,Lovely - but shambolic at breakfast time,"We stayed at the Ritz Carlton recently and generally speaking we were very pleased. Set in a lovely location in the Powerscourt grounds just a 5 minute walk outside beautiful Enniskerry, the hotel is very impressive but not perfect. Our room was very spacious and comortable with excellent facilities, but in terms of the service there were a few let-downs. We ordered some room service on arrival, including a bottle of Sancerre from the very extensive (and expensive!) wine list, but they didn't have any, and sent us a (very good) Menetou Salon instead. On night 2 we dined in the Gordon Ramsay Restaurant, where they tried very hard to provide first class service without quite achieving it. (The meal and the wine were very good, but if I'm honest, not worth the money. (The food in the hotel bar is lovely - much less pretentious and a fraction of the price.)) We ordered a bottle of Pouilly Fume this time, but they didn't have that either so the sommellier recommended........... you've guessed it, the Menetou Salon. We'd had a pre-dinner drink in the aforementioned hotel bar, which is nicely done in an old Irish pub/grocer style, but it would have been more pleasant if either one of the two lads or the girl behind the bar had been able to muster a smile or a greeting of some kind. Sadly, they just served our drinks in silence and walked away. Anyway, on to the exciting bit - the breakfast. We wandered down at about 9.55 and outside the door of the restaurant were about 30-40 very nice young people who were, like us, all looking for some breakfast. They were, I think, all guests at a wedding in the hotel the previous day and had obviously agreed to meet for breakfast as theye were perfectly entitled to do, but unfortunately the restaurant staff failed totally in organising their tables, and confusion and panic took over. It was a ridiculous scrum and nobody seemed to know what anyone else was doing about it. We stood around for 20 minutes before we got a table, and then four or five different members of staff tried to lift the plates from our table before we were finished! Still, the orange juice was delicious.......... I mentioned our experience on checking out, and was told that the hotel was nearly full. Well I'm sorry but I think a 5 star hotel ought to be able to cope with a bit of an influx at breakfast. Having got all that off my chest, I must say that the Ritz Carlton is a beautiful hotel with (generally) very helpful staff. Not perfect, but very good all the same. It's not cheap, but it is a 5 star gaff and its very good.",4,2008,08,29
217,Wonderful stay!,"Booked the Ramsey package for 1 night B&B + dinner for my husband's birthday and we were not disappointed. Check-in was flawless and were shown to our room where all the features re. air con etc were explained to us. Perhaps a little over the top as it was pretty self-explanatory but better to explain anyway I guess. 

The room was beautiful. It was a mountain view suite and was HUGE! There was a small entrance hall, guest toilet, full fitted kitchen, dining and sitting area to one side. The massive bedroom was to the other side with a large wardrobe / dressing area and the bathroom. There was also a lage terrace with loungers outside. It was a pity our stay was so brief as we didn't have enough time to simply spend in this lovely suite.  

We had a brief visit to the spa which was ok but fairly average. Few flaws here; The hot pool was out of order. Also, there were no robes or slippers available so we had to return to our room to get our robes and go barefoot as there were no slippers in our room either. I would also expect a more relaxed, luxurious ambiance in a hotel spa of this calibre with more relaxation zones and hamman spaces. 

The Ramsey restaurant was great. The service was good and the menu interesting. All the food was beautiful - a nice blend of technical skill and quality ingredients. Small mishap with the bill where we were charged for an extra glass of wine we didn't have but this was resolved easily enough. 

Breakfast was also in the Ramsey restaurant and was lovely. Plenty of choice including hot food, porridge, fish, cheese, fruit, breads and pastries. 

Quite expensive but the restaurant in particular was good value. Would probably stick to a regular room in future for a short visit. The spa could definitely be improved and the prices there are outrageous. All in all it was great. Will go back.",5,2008,08,25
217,Bad experience,"Had the pleasure of staying here in mid-August on a 2 night special package which was, or sounded like, good value. Although we are generally very positive people, we were overall extremely unimpressed with this hotel. My sense is that, on balance, the negative reviews on tripadvisor give a better sense of what to expect – which is a very nice hotel with many problems.

The good:

1. The hotel is physically very beautiful.
2. The hotel is in a quiet and relatively secluded area. Nice for walks.Make sure to visit the House (no entry fee) and gardens (8 euro per person).
3. The surrounding countryside is some of the nicest in Ireland and the concierge service will help you plan a route. Ask for the route through the sally-gap to Glendalough. Scary roads, but if you take it slow it is no trouble. 
4. Restaurant Gordon Ramsay is a jewel. Great service, amazing food. Expensive but great value. You will pay as much in many far inferior restaurants in Ireland.
5. Nice welcome gift of strawberries and three fresh roses on day 1 turndown. Very nice. 

The bad:

1. We had a pretty bad experience with one of the three TVs turning on in the middle of the night – a little disconcerting to be suddenly awoken in this way. Absolutely unacceptable that this problem continues (per other reviews below).

2. No water / hot water: On day two we went to take a shower around 11 am to find that our room had no water (shower, bath, sink, toilet). I called and was told the hotel has a water problem and it would be fixed asap. Came back that evening around 6. We had water. Great. Time for bath before dinner. But we had no hot water. Called down to reception, spoke with Elizabelth who was very apologetic and assured us that hot water would be back in around 90 minutes. So we had to go to dinner without having washed all day. 

Two points here: You expect water in any hotel, especially a 5 star. The true measure of a hotel is when things go wrong: why did I always have to contact reception to find out what was happening? I would have expected some kind of warning. Secondly, paying over 500 euro for a two night stay you expect to be able to sleep without a TV going off in the night and you expect water. If you don’t get it you expect some gesture form the hotel beyond a ‘sorry.’ We got nothing. A complimentary drink at dinner would have been nice or a look at the bill on check-out. Things go wrong, that is fine: you expect the response however to be professional and appropriate. It is not at this Ritz-Carlton.

3. Suites are poorly designed. Space is good but the location of the TV, for example, is crazy. You can’t easily watch TV sitting in the seated area or from bed. Absolutely crazy. Small point.

4. The hotel seemed to be relatively empty when we visited which was nice. Breakfast was still a disaster. On Wednesday morning at 9.30 we had to wait 15 minutes for a seat. That is absolutely crazy, especially as the hotel seemed otherwise quiet. I can’t imagine what it takes to get a seat on the weekends! Not that it is worth waiting 15 minutes for – the food is overcooked and cold! You really expect more than a bad buffet from this brand-name. Even the coffee was cold! 

In summary, a lovely new hotel in need of a complete shake-up. In terms of non-physical aspects, this property is a complete embarrassment to the reputation of the Ritz-Carlton Group and needs some serious intervention by corporate HQ.",1,2008,08,16
217,fantastic,fantastic hotel and lovely friendly staff.we had a garden  view suite and 255 euro for the bed and breakfast package it was good value..room was spacious and such a comfortable bed.we ate in mcgills and food was delicious. only gripe i have is there are no tea/coffee facilities in the rooms. definatly will be back in the next couple of months.breakfast was buffet style.plenty to eat and no problems getting seated as previously stated in other reviews.,5,2008,08,16
217,amazing hotel,"This hotel was amazing-pure bliss. On arrival we got upgraded to a junior suite and it was the best hotel room ive ever stayed in. It had a tv in the bathroom mirror, touch buttons for lights and walk in wardrobe. 
The service was excellent, and the decor was first class. The food was great. The only compliant was there was problems with the bill when checking out., It wasnt that big a problem but shouldnt have happened for the standard.
Loved the hotel overall",5,2008,08,11
217,Ugly building; very comfortable inside,"I'll get the bad stuff out of the way first: Do not be fooled by the rural setting.  This is a spectacularly ugly building - looking like something from Las Vegas and approached across a sea of paving flags with minimal planting.  Large areas of surface car parking abound and there is an enormous rectangular smoke stack, stained black with soot, to one side.  The view from the main lounge comprises a distant view of the Sugar Loaf peak, with a helicopter landing pad and a poorly landscaped lawn (scarred by tractor tracks during our stay) in the foreground.  This 'view' is framed by a row of ragged-looking pine trees. Now the good stuff: once we got over the poor first impression, our room was spacious, very luxurious, and attractively decorated.  The bed was very very comfortable and the bathroom, toiletries, and large dressing room were all first class. The pool area was quiet and relaxing. The service was excellent and very friendly.  Given its proximity to Dublin, this is an ideal place for a short Romantic getaway.  Two final gripes - no slippers were provided in the bedroom; and the ceiling in the large Gordon Ramsey restaurant was so low that I got claustrophobic over my breakfast (I am average height and could easily touch the ceiling).",4,2008,08,11
217,Enjoyed Powerscourt,"My wife and I stayed one night at the Ritz Carlton Powerscourt last Saturday. We were upgraded to a suite. I had previously eaten at Gordon Ramsay's and enjoyed the experience immensely.
Check in was straightforward and we were accompanied to our suite by the receptionist.
The technology takes some understanding and is not entirely intuitive! The bed was excellent and ensured a super night's sleep. Evening turn down brought two small bottles of water - perhaps larger would be more appropriate.
We ate dinner in McGills pub where service was impeccable and food was good. We had been out at a function and did not want the full Ramsay experience and had not tried to book it. 

Breakfast in Gordon Ramsay's was delightful - an outstandingly imaginative buffet and the offer of cooked eggs or anything else - this was a little vague to say the least. The lack of a menu may be a problem to some I suspect especially buffet haters -no matter how good it is!
We did not try the spa or other facilities as we were heading off quickly on Sunday morning.
Overall a great experience and attentive staff.",5,2008,08,11
217,Busy Hotel & standards increasing. Ramsay's was excellent!,"This is a very busy RC, not simply in terms of rooms & suites, of the 200 rooms, there are 124 suites, but also in terms of Banqueting. The Hotel's ballroom can accommodate 400 for dinner or a wedding reception & the RC also had the Catering Contract for the event suite in Powerscourt House, that www is linked to the RC site, so there may be various events and particularly wedding receptions present should you be staying at the weekend. So, possibly the difference between this & any other RC's might be evident in the number of guests that are attending functions rather than staying for pleasure. The prices should be no surprise for regular RC-ers, but there are some odd charges like Valet parking for example. The staff are well trained, well turned out, with a gratifying mix of non-nationals & Irish backgrounds. The building is beautifully designed (Palladian) in the usual Clubby wood panelled RC style (Georgian), and the design & layout of the Banqueting Rooms are particularly glorious, especially the Wine Room available for private hire. The other great aspect of the design is that the Sudo- Irish Bar & all the event suites are located in a separate wing of the property & not on the bedroom, reception, restaurant crescent. The rooms are stunning & there are many pics already on this site for perusal, Bulgari toiletries are always luxurious! Just be mindful of the views-back get the manicured formal gardens below reception & front gets the mountain & the horrible helipad-just remember to focus on the mountain instead!
The Gordon Ramsay restaurant was excellent, both with regard to food & service & we believe quite reasonably priced for the food quality, decor & service provided.
For an extra treat, book the Chef's table in the Kitchen (max of 10 people) its only 150 Euros per person.
The only niggle was Breakfast-as any well seasoned traveller knows- Saturday & Sunday morning Breakfasts are always a challenge for any property to deliver successfully. The RC attempts to ease the queuing numbers by opening the casual all-day dining venue(Sugar Loaf) on the reception level & this does feel like a poor relation to the GR restaurant breakfast on the lower level, complete with greats views & the terrace! 
The Spa & pool complex is simply beautiful & one of the best designed & chic areas we have ever witnessed- you must give it a try & also for the non-child friendly guest, there are the restricted kids hours- a kid free pool-Fantastic!
We would recommend this Hotel & it is great to see a RC on the Island of Ireland.",4,2008,08,07
217,Not a proper Ritz Carlton,"Before arrival and the reservation Process:
I telephoned the UK Reservations number on 0800 234 000, whilst I normally make my reservations through the RC website, on this occasion I was unable to find my preferred Club Suite and thought the reservation agent may be able to help with this. 
It took over five minutes for an agent to answer the telephone, when I finally managed to speak to a member of staff she gave the impression that she was reading off a script, the interaction was very slow and almost comical. She asked various questions such as if we had stayed at a Ritz Carlton before? And if we were celebrating anything special? When I said that we had just come back from Japan and stayed at your Tokyo and Osaka properties there was just silence, I was expecting some small talk about the holiday. 

I also mentioned that it was my partner’s Birthday and that is why we were staying at the Powerscourt premises, I assumed this would have been noted and perhaps a birthday card or a small acknowledgement made on arrival but we received neither.
 
Restaurant booking:
We were booked on a Gordon Ramsey Dining Experience rate. The reservations agent advised me that the restaurant would be in touch to take our dinner reservation.  

No telephone call was received; I had to send an email and was telephoned back by the Gordon Ramsey Restaurant Team. 

Concierge Request: 
We sent a service request through the Ritz Carlton website asking for information on the wooden sculpture park at Ashford including opening times and directions.  

I received an email back from Robbie Smyth on the 3rd June confirming my request; he stated that he had a map showing the sculpture of the woodland on it. He stated he couldn’t find the opening times but had telephoned them and left them a message and as soon as he heard anything he would email us back. No email was received so we assumed the information including the map would be waiting for us in our suite on arrival. It wasn’t there. We went to the Concierge desk and spoke to Alan who had no knowledge of the request and asked us to come back in 10 minutes when his colleague would be there. We asked if perhaps his colleague could telephone us in our room. 
His colleague did ring us later that afternoon but no information had been passed on regarding what we were inquiring about, we therefore had to explain everything again. Finally the Chef Concierge arranged for the information to be brought to our room. 

Brochure Request: 
We made a request for a hotel brochure through the RC website using the “Service Request” function. We requested a hotel brochure as we wanted to show our family where we were going as we had planned to spend Christmas at the Powerscourt hotel in 2009 and this would have been a trial run to check the property out.  

On our initial contact we received an on screen acknowledgement that the request had been sent and we would hear from the hotel soon. 

No brochure was received after a week so we sent a second request, this time by using “Contact Hotel “and selecting “General Brochure Requests”, we received an on screen acknowledgement but still no brochure. 

Finally about a week before our stay we sent a final request, again by the “Brochure Request” link, we still to this day await the delivery of the brochure.
 
Arrival:
We arrived at the hotel to an initial impression of a large grand hotel. We found a parking space right next to the entrance (parking bay number one!). 

A member of staff saw us arrive but instead of coming over and welcoming us or asking if we needed any help with our luggage they just ignored us and started talking to a van driver making a delivery at the entrance. 

We walked to the door and made our way into the lobby, again completely ignored by the staff outside.  

Check-in
We approached the reception desk and were greeted by a friendly receptionist who issued our key card and called a member of staff over to show us to our room and help with luggage.  There were no issues with the check-in process. 

The Garden View Suite
The member of staff accompanied us to our suite; he gave us a quick introduction to the hotels facilities and explained what the suite offered. 

As soon as we entered the suite (Room 237) we both commented on how hot the room was. The member of staff checked the air conditioning and turned it down from 20° to 19° which he said was the lowest it would go but admitted it was very warm. 

He explained how to operate the electronic console and the other room facilities. I asked if there was any bottled water to be told that it was in the honour bar and available for a nominal charge (this turned out to be €5.25 for a 50cl bottle). 

I then asked where the tea & coffee making facilities were only to be told that the room doesn’t have any however you could call down for tea and coffee, there was no mention of any cost to this. 
The initial impression of the Garden View Suite is that it is a good size and attractively decorated to the usual high Ritz Carlton standards. 

It wasn’t until we had unpacked and had time to explore the room further that we started to become disappointed. 

The door handle to the bathroom double doors came off in my hand, and then the handle to the toilet door did the same. 

There were two wardrobes of a good size but only one of them had any hangers and then only eight were supplied. We were only stopping one night but we still had our dinner outfits, gym wear, the next day’s clothing, and an extra change of clothing just in-case not to mention our jackets.  

The bathroom was beautiful but again lacked the finishing touches, no cotton wool pads, no shaving kit, no toothbrush or mouthwash, no hair brush or comb all these items have been readily available in the room at every RC hotel we have stayed in. 
Again the living room was lacking the little touches that make RC the high class brand that it is. There was no DVD player or sound system in the room, only the 32” LCD TV which you had to pay for movies or music from. 

There was inadequate glassware for a suite, two wine glasses and two tall tumblers, not suitable for drinking a liqueur from the honour bar and not enough for entertaining any guests if you wished to do so. 

No bottle opener or corkscrew to open any of the honour bar drinks with despite the service guide stating there should be one. Neither were there any cocktail stirrers to mix a gin and tonic with. 

There was no welcome letter or complimentary fruit, not to mention a total lack of recognition for our past custom with RC and no acknowledgement of my partner’s birthday. 

The concierge information we asked for (see above) wasn’t in our room on arrival and no confirmation of our dinner reservation in the Gordon Ramsey Restaurant. 

When we booked our room we were told it would be a “Garden View Suite” with views overlooking landscaped gardens and the surrounding Powerscourt Estate. The RC website also confirms this information. What view did we get? A ground floor view of a fire escape, the rear entrance to a pub, the door to the Kids Club, a few over grown shrubs, cigarette ends and lots of weeds on an internal courtyard.  

Thankfully the hotel was quiet and the Pub was closed (a separate matter), I would have been even more upset if we had suffered noise from children in the kids club or noise from those on the smoking area of the pub. I also wouldn’t have been happy regarding the lack of privacy, we did have a net curtain but that doesn’t stop the feeling of being overlooked.

I would probably expect an exaggerated statement such as this from a package tour operator but never from a Ritz Carlton. 
As I said before the room is fantastic in size and internal appearance but it is these little touches that make a hotel what it is, especially in a suite. 

Anyway let me continue with the problems.....
We had now unpacked our luggage and I was hoping to take a sleep before dinner as we had been awake since 0430hrs that morning. 

Unfortunately the temperature in the room was getting hotter and hotter and we were now both nearly passing out. 

I telephoned reception at 1515hrs and explained the problem, I also told them about the two door handles that had come off in my hand. I was told that an engineer would attend to our room within about 15 minutes. 

Whilst we were waiting for the engineer we decided to order some tea. My partner pressed the in room dining button only to be greeted by an automatic message asking if we knew the extension number and to enter it. He tried again and this time a member of staff answered only to say he needed in room dining and they would have to transfer the call (it was in room dining that was pressed!). 

The tea arrived for us to discover a charge of €5 each plus a €4 service charge.  

I have no problem paying for items ordered from room service and a service charge is expected. However it is also expected that a Five Star hotel would have the appropriate facilities to prepare your own hot drinks within your room. Again this has never been a problem in a RC before.  

The RC website lists the following facilities for a Garden View Suite: 

Food & Beverages 
•	Room service, 24-Hour 
•	Bottled water, complimentary 
•	Instant hot water 
•	Mini-bar 

I would assume by listing “Instant hot water” under Food & Beverages that it would mean there were the means to make a hot drink. I also question where the complimentary bottled water is. 

The tea was delivered without any biscuits (the little touches missing again) and no lemon for the earl grey. 

I asked for some lemon and waited another 10 minutes while the member of staff went to get some. By the time they had brought it to the room the tea was no longer hot. 

Fed up and totally disappointed the time was now 1600hrs and still no engineer had arrived. The heat was getting worse and I now had a throbbing headache. I telephoned again; I was given an apology and was promised a call back. 

I was called a few minutes later by reception to be told that an engineer is working on the problem and would be up in about 15 minutes to fix the door handles. They asked if I would like to speak to a Manager about the problems, I said that I would and she told me that the Manager would be asked to make contact. 
The maintenance gentleman arrived at the suite at 1610hrs and apologised for the problem. He confirmed that the room was “boiling hot” and stated that the problem had been caused by a fault on the main heating valve that had been turned to be fully on causing excessive heat to enter the system and instead of blowing cold air it was blowing hot air. He stated this had affected several rooms and that cold air should start to blow through. 

He fixed the door handles and advised me to call back in an hour if the room hadn’t cooled down. 

At 1640hrs I received a call from the “Call Centre” asking if Maintenance had been to the room. I confirmed that they had and told them what they had said. I also told her that the room was still very hot, it was not getting any cooler, the air conditioning was blowing cold air now but the fan speed was so low (it was set to high) that it would take hours to even notice any change. 
I also told the call centre that I wasn’t happy that the Manager hadn’t made contact within the last 40 minutes; she apologised and said she would pass my comments on to the Management team. 

Five minutes later I received a telephone call from Patric Werner the Duty Manager. I explained that we were un-happy with the suite, the problems with the heating, the door handles, the lack of view and lack of facilities. He said he would try and find a cooler room and ring us back. 

At 1705hrs we received a further call from Patric stating he was outside and he offered to show us to a different suite to see if it was suitable.

The suite we were shown was room number 242 a Mountain View Suite. As soon as we entered the corridor outside our room we noticed the lovely cool air and Patric commented on the heat from our original room. 

The Mountain View Suite
We confirmed the new suite was suitable and Patric then helped us move all of our clothes and baggage to our new room. 
Unfortunately there was now no chance of having a quick sleep before dinner, my headache was worse than ever and we were very disappointed.  

I do ask why the first suite wasn’t checked before our arrival as it was very evident how hot the room was. It could also have been picked up by the person who escorted us to our room. Instead we were made to wait over 2 hours until we were moved. 

Whilst I appreciate we had in theory been given an upgrade to this new suite there was no other form of service recovery. 
I did ask Patric to arrange for some tea and coffee making facilities and some complimentary water to be brought to the new suite which was done whilst we were getting ready. The only problem was the bottled water was poured into the kettle for some reason. 

Again this new suite was missing some of the smaller things that make a five star hotel what it is. The bottle that should contain bath salts was empty, again no shaving kit etc. No fruit in the suite, half of the magazines in the suite were out of date, four large wardrobes but again only eight hangers in one of the wardrobes and none in the others. 

The closet in the entrance hallway for hanging coats had no hangers to put them on. No tissues in the guest bathroom and only one hand towel. 

The TV in the living room is in the wrong place as you can’t see it directly from the sofa; it also suffers with noise distortion due to the cabinet it has been placed in. 

No sound system or DVD player despite plenty of space for one.  
A suite is often used for entertaining guests yet again there were only two wine glasses and two tumblers, no cocktail stirrers, all the same things missing as the previous suite. 

There was a nice kitchen area with a coffee machine but no instructions on how to use it and no milk or sugar provided not to mention any cups, saucers, etc. 

There were many empty cupboards in every room of the suite, perhaps some could be filled with some books, DVD’s, Music CD’s, Sound System, DVD Player, IPod Dock, Small box of chocolates or biscuits, all things that are common place in even a four star hotel. 

The outdoor terrace was a nice feature however we were expecting fantastic views similar to those on the RC website. It was now that we realised that most of the landscaping pictures on the RC website are of the neighbouring Powerscourt estate and not the hotel grounds. Instead we had a view of grass leading to an overgrown area where the helicopter pad is located. Thankfully the view of the mountain distracted from the otherwise plain landscape. Why couldn’t a few colourful flower beds be added? 

I’m sure by now you’ll think we are being picky and looking for problems. Unfortunately the problems kept leaping out at us and therefore that made us look in more detail at what exactly we were paying for.

Pre Dinner Drinks
We went to Restaurant Gordon Ramsey to have a pre dinner drink. After trying to remember what floor we were on and if we needed to go up or down in the lift (the floor number system is very confusing and we weren’t the only ones, even the staff hate it!!!), we arrived at the restaurant, we peered through the windows but couldn’t see any lounge to have a drink so we assumed we must use the Sugar Loaf Lounge. 

At the Sugar Loaf Lounge we sat down at a table that had two dead roses in a small vase (very nice!), after five minutes a member of staff came over and offered us a menu. My partner chose champagne and I wanted a Strawberry Daiquiri. Unfortunately a Strawberry Daiquiri isn’t offered on the limited cocktail menu (6 cocktails from what I remember), I asked if the bar person could make one anyway. The member of staff went away and came back and told me it wouldn’t be possible. I therefore chose a Singapore Sling. 

While we were waiting for our drinks, Patric came over to ask if everything was now running smoothly. I told him about the problem with the Strawberry Daiquiri, he went to the bar and also confirmed they couldn’t do one. I asked why there were unable to make such a simple drink, I pointed out that they had lime juice, strawberries, rum and sugar syrup as they were all formed part of the other cocktails so why couldn’t they put them all together to make a daiquiri?  

Patric agreed that it seemed stupid and he asked me to leave it with him. He went off returning a few minutes later to state that Restaurant Gordon Ramsey would be able to make a Daiquiri for me when we went down. Our other drinks then arrived. Yes we finally got our Daiquiris but why couldn’t the Sugar Loaf Lounge make them, this is a five star hotel and I can’t believe the bar staff are so poorly skilled that they can’t make a simple cocktail. 

Dinner
Following our drinks we made our way back to Restaurant Gordon Ramsey, we were greeted at the door and showed to our table. We then noticed the lounge area at the other side where we could have had the drinks of our choice. 

The Daiquiris were brought to our table and were excellent. The evening in the restaurant was perfect, food, service, drinks everything, excellent. 

My only comment would be about the location of the rest rooms. Has the designer of the hotel put any thought into it? Who wants to go on a five minute walk round the building to go to the toilet during a meal where you are paying hundreds of euros? Surly toilet facilities could be located within the restaurant itself. 

Turn Down
We returned to our suite to find that we had received turn down but again the little things were missing. No chocolate, no weather forecast for the next day, the napkin had been placed next to the bed but no one had bothered to get the slippers out of the wardrobe and place them next to the bed as well. Other RC properties do this!

The day time pillows had been taken off the bed but had been left at the end of the bed on the floor. There are four large wardrobes, countless cupboards, surly the pillows could have been put away. Our bathroom items hadn’t been tidied up or placed neatly on a face cloth. The towels had been replaced but the dressing gowns hadn’t been hung up. Yes these are little things but they are all things that have been done in every other RC hotel and they do mean a lot to guests who come to expect this level of service from the brand. 

Breakfast
The next morning we went to breakfast expecting the same high quality, how wrong we were. 

Yes we were greeted and shown to our table. We were then left 10 minutes before someone offered us coffee or juice and another 5 minutes until it arrived. 

There were no menus on the table at all and no indication anywhere of what you could order. The cold buffet was very good with a nice selection of cheese, fruit and cereals. The pastries were disappointing and nothing special. 

My partner managed to “flag down” a member of staff and asked about ordering poached eggs. It wasn’t a problem but you would expect a menu indicating what is on offer. 

When the eggs arrived he went to top the plate up with items from the “hot” buffet only to discover when he started to eat it that the buffet items were all cold. He complained as did several other guests and fresh items were cooked but this once again spoiled the experience. 

Why aren’t the kitchen staff checking the temperature of the hot food, or even better why isn’t it cooked to order? I would also add that the sausages are an embarrassment to Ireland (they were cheap, tastless and cold)

The rest of the stay
We later returned to our room to enjoy our view of the overgrown helicopter pad and the mountain. 

At 1140hrs the door to the suite opened without any knock or press of the door bell and in walked a member of housekeeping staff. My partner was getting changed for the gym at the time but thankfully was in the bedroom with the door closed. The member of staff did apologise and said that the room was down on her sheet as unoccupied. 

At 1505hr the same thing happened, no knock or press of the doorbell and a member of staff again walked straight in, explaining the suite was shown as unoccupied. She then sensed we were not happy and she asked if she could check the mini bar. She did this and then left. 

At 1510hr yet another member of housekeeping came to the door, at least this time she knocked before opening the door. By this time I was very angry about the total lack of communication between staff in this hotel. 

You may think things could get no worse, sorry but they do. 
We rang in room dining to request Afternoon Tea in our suite. The response was the normal “not quite sure if we can do that” attitude we were now coming to expect from this hotel. The member of staff said they would have to ring the Sugar Loaf Lounge and enquire and then would ring me back. 

In the meantime I telephoned Patric again as I was very unhappy regarding the staff from housekeeping entering the room without knocking. 

He assured me we could have Afternoon Tea in the suite and that it would be delivered as soon as possible. I ordered vegetarian sandwiches for myself and normal sandwiches for my partner.

The tea arrived and looked very nice, the member of staff went into detail explaining about every little detail. This was a bit pointless however as the detail on the plate were missing.
Yes I was given vegetarian sandwiches and yes the member of staff explained which ones they were. The sandwiches were on two plates but instead of separating the vegetarian ones onto one plate and the meat ones onto the other they were all mixed together. This meant we had to pick them apart to find out which were the ones I had ordered. 

We then started on the scones; well we could have done if they were edible. We tried to cut then but they were cold and rock hard and the centre of the scone was dry as if it was stale.

I telephoned in room dining and was told some fresh scones would be sent up. They arrived and were this time red hot and soggy as though they had been placed in a microwave. When I tasted the scone I was unable to eat it as the middle was soggy. 
It was then that I noticed the date on the pot of Irish Coffee Curd that I had put on my scone and nearly eaten. It was over a month out of date. I have retained the jar as evidence.

I immediately telephone Patric and explained again the poor standards of service and the out of date food. He advised me that the Afternoon Tea would not be charged (I should hope not!) 
We immediately packed and went to check out. 

We have been promised that these problems were rare and that our contstructive comments have been noted. We are returning to the RC Powerscourt. Hopefully it has improved. We'll see..",1,2008,07,21
217,love / loathe experience,"I really don't know where to start and that is a first !! There are a few plusses and a few irritations to say the least.
Receptionist was not the best, we got our room card (no offer to help with our bags) proceeded upstairs to it where we were greeted by house keeping. We went downstairs again where the receptionist gave us the correct cards for our suite. Apologising for her mistake, finally she remembered to ask did we want help with our bags. This should have been dealth with immediately when we first arrived not just because she made a mess of our room allocation.   
I was blown away by the fantastic scenic location, impressive building and furniture, amazing suite (it was massive and very well presented), heavenly bed, beautiful bvulgari toiletries, heated bathroom floor and fantastic spa. Also the fact that they delivered handmade chocolates to our room for my birthday was a nice touch. 
There were no magazines in the room, I enquired at reception and some were sent up. 
No tea making facilities which is an annoyance in this type of establishment, I know you expect to be fleeced here but for god's sake, is a complimentary cup of tea to much to ask? I was extremely disappointed with the breakfast (dried rashers, cheap sausages and pudding, horrible tea), the only saving grace at breakfast was the amount of fresh fruit available which was nice, the muffins, selection of yogurts and the smoked salmon. Breakfast staff were not the best. 
I found them inhospitable with the exception of one young irish girl. (blonde middle aged woman barked at us for our room number at breakfast, which we gave and she still took down the wrong number. she obviously loves her job! :) ) 

Dinner in ramseys I have to say was a bit of disaster. Starter was plesant (scallops)as was the beautiful dessert (a cheese cake with amaretti), however the main course left an extremely long hair in my mouth. (NOTE avoid the hairy halibut dish!) I sent it back immediately and did not sample any further main course.  
The staff were I felt were lacking in genuine hospitatility skills (unlike in the upstairs sugar loaf lounge whom were a joy). They just seemed to buzz around and not really listen to you. The service was haphazard to say the least.

Head to the sugar loaf lounge for some interesting food, pear and walnut salad, a tasty concoction.
The staff were very friendly and at last, a decent cup of tea (made with tea leaves).

The spa I have to mention was fabulous as were the treatments. Excellent staff especially a blonde girl (I think her name was Kathy). Be sure to avail of the back, face and shoulder massage with volcanic stones. It was unbelievable.

For the price this hotel is charging I feel the experience should have been near perfect. I have stayed in numerous 5 * establishments that deserve their 5 *'s. I feel sadly this is not one of them due to service in certain areas. Teething problems still aplenty!",4,2008,07,21
217,Just Bliss!,I like many others read some pretty terrible or average reviews on this hotel before we left and shoud have skipped the poor reviews and read only the good!! The Ritz in powerscourt is wonderful.  I travelled with husband and two children 6 and 1 and could not have been made more welcome. We were upgraded to mountain view suite ( garden view suite booked) and my goodness we loved every bit of our 2 night stay. The room was beautiful the food was delicious. EVERY member of staff we encountered were courteous and very helpful.  Special praise was to the Gordon Ramsey restaurant! Marrianne and Cederic were just great!! The meal was magical and the tour of the kitchen to meal the Chef Paul  was a lovey finish to our evening!! I say to you all go to the Ritz Carlton in Powerscourt and enjoy it!  They deserve praise were praise is due! If there is anything you are not happy about or need amended just ask and it will be done!!! bon voyage!!!,5,2008,07,16
217,Hotel & Gordan Ramsay - DISAPPOINTING,"Beautiful plush surrondings and very friendly staff on arrival so thought...great!  Room was fabulous comfortable bed, lovely big bathroom.  However no slippers with robes provided so rang down for them and noted there was no mineral water provided.....2 plastic bottles of Evian arrived later.....or you could purchase a 50cl for 5 euro in the mini bar.  Went for a swim which was very nice.  However the towels are rather like hand towels in size and so I just asked for a 2nd.  Thought that was a little odd.
Anyway headed off for dinner in Gordan Ramsay (celebrating husband 30th birthday) and that was really disappointing.  There are up to 20 waiting staff BUZZING around continuously which is extremely disconcerting.  I would say 4-5 had descended on our table within the first 5 minutes seeing did we want apertifs, bread, water, menus etc....yet we did still have to ask for the wine list.  On reflection perhaps this was deliberate, that we might trust the sommelier choice because be warned there are very few bottles under 100 euro.  I thought a very extensive (largely french) but extremely expensive wine menu....typically bottles priced between 2-300!!  The food itself was nice but not mind blowing .  I do like that the waiter reiterates the dish as it is served to you.  However I don't like that they hover constantly until the fork is put down waiting for immediate retrival of the plate.  They also chat a little too much for my liking, I would rather chat to the people I am with when out for dinner.  The staff are trying WAY too hard....everyone is invited into the kitchen at the end of the meal for a little tour which is interesting...not so sure if the chef impressed with us all trooping in and out constantly though and can't blame him for that.
The air conditining minimum temperature is 19 degrees and we both found the room too hot and stuffy.  We just came back from 2 weeks hols in Italy where the temp were in the high 30's so I can't quite explain that one!!???!!
The worst bit for me was breakfast.  We arrived at 10.20 at Gordan Ramsay (breakfast until 10.30 there) to be told there were no available tables so we were redirected to the Sugar Loaf Lobby area.  I assumed the same food would be available.  There was a ""fry"" buffet, a small bit of fresh fruit, yogurts, some bread (toast it yourself) and a few scones.  Orange juice, tea/coffee was brought to your table.  There wasn't a chef in sight.  I asked the waitress for a menu, thinking the eggs benedict, waffles, omlettes etc that I had read about (all individually and expensively priced) in the room service menu would be there, but no.  I then went up and asked a member of staff and he explained to me that breakfast was finished in Gordan Ramsay at 10.30.  I looked at my watch and it was by now 10.35.  I could however request an omlette.   When I questioned further as to pancakes etc. and would I have to think of something off the top of my head, he said he could have a word with the chef and see.  At this stage I said forget it, I would just have some of the fry.  There was nothing wrong with the fry......but I could have got the same at Mother Hubbard's and it would be cooked freshly and been served!!!
On checking out, the man at reception asked whether I had enjoyed my stay and I answered honestly that I was very disappointed with breakfast.  He was handing me the invoice as I said this and I almost fell over when I saw this ""fry"" buffet was costing 50 euro.  He then eliminated this charge.
Something else I notice and am not impressed with is that I made the reservation back in February and the room cost 395 euro.  The cost has reduced since that and I was not informed of that.
In summary the hotel is very plush and loads of extras are available but all at a cost .e.g. rent a film 11.50 or 1 hour of internet 12.50.  Its as if there are strict rules to be observed and fines and penalties (or charges) are imposed if these are not adhered to.  Just checking my emails today saw one from the hotel about our Gordan Ramsay reservation from a few days ago.  I thought they might be looking for some feedback and opened it.  Instead it was to reconfirm the reservation and inform us to arrive promptly or else or table could not be guarenteed???  Hello was there a queue outside of people about to jump into our seats...I think not.  At the speed we were served there would be no fear of an overrun on time...not a relaxing ambiance at all I'm afraid.  
We stayed in the Marriott Druids Glen a few years ago and despite not the plush surrondings I would put it far ahead of the RC.",3,2008,07,14
217,Super Service,"Went here with a few friends for an overnight and Dinner in Ramseys. Can't fault the place we were very well looked after, Our room was amazing, Very big and hi tech I loved the TV in the bathroom mirror.
Our party had the tasting menu and everone enjoyed it
Will definitley be going back",5,2008,07,11
217,not a 5 star - stear clear of Ramsay's,"Hi. I'm currently going through my recent visits to hotels and retrospectively reviewing. I'm basing this review on the hotels star rating of 5. I stayed there for New Year of 2008 and was on the whole disappointed. I expected more given the brand and rating. If you opt to park your own car, then you have to run a gauntlet of large potted shrubs and cars parked on footpaths to get to the main entrance. The room was splendid. There was a lovely turf fire buring in the main lobby area. However, the bar seats were extremely uncomfortable (like church pews) and the bar stank of cooking food which is very off-putting if you have already eaten. Ramsay's restaurant was a total letdown. Food was overcooked and the staff were trying way too hard and made me feel  uncomfortable. Doesn't deserve 5 stars imo.",2,2008,06,27
217,"Handsome property, Nice location","This is a very nice property and our price was OK for a Ritz but the temptation is to spend my whole review saying why they fell short which isn't fair but here goes... our ordered rollaway wasn't ready and took 2 hours to find, the public areas overlook a helicopter pad, some room features such as the bathroom mirror/TV didn't work and the staff was cool at best. Now the good stuff. The room was stunning. The Powerscourt attractions and golf are fantastic. The pub was fun. The food was great. I'd go back.",4,2008,06,11
217,A heavenly break,"Just back from a 2 night stay as a treat for my partners birthday. From start to finish, everything was amazing. Never before came upon solid wooden floors in a hotel suite, huge walk in wardrobe, loads Bulgari toiletries, heated marble bathroom floors, the list is endless.

Upon arriving in our garden view suite, we answered door to a staff member with a plate of strawberries and various dips and happy 30th birthday. Such an unexpected delightful thought by the staff.

We had spa treatments where my partner received a birthday card from staff, the AMAZING pool was deserted bar the 2 of us and it was divine, crystals on the floor of pool shining up. 

Dined in Sugar Loaf and Gordon Ramsays, no complaints either with any, very unusual menu in Ramsays tho, Pig trotters anyone???

I cannot wait to go back for another trip, simply the best experience ever and special mention for Sara in Ramsays and Michal in Sugar Loaf.",5,2008,06,09
217,"Exceptional Property, Service Getting Better","We just completed a three-day stay at this gorgeous new Ritz Carlton, which holds a commanding presence in Powerscourt and overlooks Sugarloaf Mountain. The common areas are handsome and bold, while the rooms are more muted but large and quiet. We have stayed at many Ritz properties, and this one has the potential to run away with the title of ""Most Beautiful."" The only minor drawback(s) seemed to be the occasional lack of service, which we attribute to understaffing at this point. Not sure why, but perhaps the present economy has something to do with it. Where normally the Ritz service is seamless, here there were occasional blips and errors. Nothing that can't be corrected, however. It didn't hurt that we had a suite with a balcony overlooking the Wicklow Mountains, and that the weather was exceptional (see photos). Highly recommended.",5,2008,06,07
217,"Confusing layout , uninterested staff..","I was first to check in and there were lots of staff floating about aimlessly so I was waiting/expecting/hoping one of them would help me with my bags, nobody batted an eyelid and I was completely ignored after check in. I eventually found the elevator, I suppose I was €10 better off as the porter certainly didn't want it!!! 

The suite was very nice (we upgraded for an extra €40), no complaints there. We then went to find the bar and it took us about 15 mins to find it, the floors marked on the elevator don't match up so we went downstairs and asked the hostess where the bar was and she very nicely took us up to the conference part of the hotel to the hidden bar?! The bar is like a dated contrived Irish bar, the type of bars that we all tired of in the early 1990's!! totally geard towards the wealthy Americans, awful furniture , great food and lovely staff though. 

Breakfast was ridiculous , we had to wait 35 mins to get a table with no waiting area outside Ramseys for the droves of aggitated fellow guests, One would get a better breakfast in a roadside caravan!",3,2008,06,04
217,Highly Recommended,"I am a little confused at some of the dreadful reviews for this hotel as my husband and I just came back from a wonderful weekend here. 
The building is fabulous and although I would agree that McGills bar downstairs is pretty dingy, we just had drinks on the tarrace outside Ramsays restaurant during the day and in the Sugar Loaf lounge in the evenings. 
I found the staff very pleasant and the room was great. But what topped it all off for me was Ramsays Restaurant. The food was extremely high quality  and the staff were great fun as well as being extremely good. We even got a tour of the kitchen and met the head chef! If people want huge portions don't bother but this should not be what it is about. 
Walking the ground up to Powerscourt Estate is also a lovely stroll. I would highly recommend a visit here and am looking forward to going back!",5,2008,06,03
217,Well deserved 5 stars,"Just returned from a two night stay in the Ritz Carlton. We were dubious given some of the previous reviews but we need not have been worried. 

Check in was quick, efficient and very friendly - a good start. 

Our room was beautiful complete with its own terrace (loungers and a table for breakfast) looking out onto the Sugar Loaf mountain. The room also came with a separate dressing room, a fantastic bathroom (underfloor heating, separate shower, Bvlgari soaps, shampoos and lotions even a candle and matches should the mood take you) and curtains you could close from the bed. Unlike others we had no problems with the TV in the bathroom, a nice additional touch. 

We ate in both McGills pub and Gordon Ramsey's restaurant. The food in McGills was very good but surpassed by the service and attention of the staff who couldn't do enough for you. The experience of Gordon Ramsey's restaurant was good. I agree with previous reviewers in that the food is very expensive for what it is but then again I suspect that we paid more for a royalty fee to Gordon Ramsey than for the actual food. That said, the service was excellent. The staff were attentive and well informed from the semellier to the girl explaining the vast cheese platter. 

Although we did not avail of the fitness centre (open 24 hrs) or the spa we did visit both and found the staff offered information without being pushy. 

Overall the break exceeded expectations and we will return before the end of the year with the children (Children are very welcome and the staff we spoke to made a point of outlining the merits of the childrens club). 

We would highly recommend this hotel.",5,2008,05,31
217,Spectacular Property,"I had the opportunity to visit this incredible resort for a long weekend. If you are visiting the Dublin area, do not miss The Ritz-Carlton, Powerscourt. Nestled in the private and stunning Powerscourt Estate, The Ritz-Carlton stands as a beacon of luxury and intimacy for the traveller seeking a getaway. The building is extremely impressive at first glance and will exceed your expectations. The staff is remarkably well-trained and courteous. The guestrooms are first class (tvs in the bathroom mirrors, walk-in dressing rooms in standard rooms, HUGE accommodations, remote control draperies, bedside control for temperature, etc., cordless telephones to use anywhere on property, beautiful amenities, etc.)--this hotel is spectacular. The Ritz-Carlton, Powerscourt will impress even the most refined of tastes. Do not miss the incredible spa and pool (with crystals) or Gordon Ramsey restaurant. This hotel is wonderful!!!",5,2008,05,27
217,Sugar Loaf resort leaves a bitter taste...,"I was also part of the party who wrote the last review adn would like to add to that review ( suprrising that there is more to complain about but trust me there was !!) 

Firstly , Booked a round of golf for 2 in the party and asked conierge how to get to the course "" You can drive up or walk up"" Yeah walk up carrying a full set of clubs and clothes , no offer of a free transfer to the clubhouse , If this resort wants to associate itself with the courses it should provide a better service to them. What if we would have wanted a few drinks after the game? Would we have to order a taxi?  this service me be available but was never offered to us.

After arriving back we did decided to go for a drink after the game in McGills bar which is on site at the hotel , bar is decorated in a very old authentic style ( that authentic even the roofs are painted 
a lovely nicotene colour ?) Not the most comfortable of bars as all stools are wooden , not great for relaxing on afetr a round of golf. Although staff were friendly enough in here if lacking some bar knowledge , asked for a cranberry juice and a brandy , had to stop him before he poured the 2 in to 1 glass? Who knows may be a new coacktail? 

Dinner in Ramsay's was best described as an over rated farce. 
At one stage I counted 18 people working the floor but as described above we had to ask 3 times for coffee ? 
Fodd was prepared to the highest standards , although many people have complained about the sizes and others have replied that it is not large portions you come here for I agree with both , but 2 tiny pieces of lamb for roughly 46 Euros is just beyong belief..

Also mentoined before the malfunctoining bathroom tv with a mind of it's own that kept switching on and off at full volume all night made for a poor nights sleep..

Breakfast was a buffet style fruit and ceral choice is second to none.. , eggs ran out , bacon was rubbery and overcooked , Sausages looked greasey and over done as well.. 2 star

Check out: At check out we were presented with the bill firstly none of our room rates seemed to have included breakfast at 58 euros for 3 rooms almost 180 euro for our party of 6 is shocking for the qaulity of breakfast.
Next we were being charged for 4 people playing golf even though there was only 2 of us , supposed to be 3 but one pulled out , we informed the hotel of this over 5 days in advance , receptoinist would not believe us , had to call golf course to check that inly 2 did play. Made us feel as if we were trying to rob a free game of golf ? In truth the only people who were robbed this weekend was our party by the quality and over rated / priced services of this so called 5 star hotel",1,2008,05,19
217,Couldn't have been worse,"I'll start from our arrival at the Hotel...We arrived a 12noon and all was going well they had organised that we could check in on arrival. We had taken this night away as it was my Mothers 50th Birthday and we wanted to treat her! I had ordered Flowers and Chololates to be in her room when we arrived, she got into the room and the flowers where in the Bin on the floor (no vase in site) and no Chocolates! 

We let this pass and we all went to lunch in Sugar Loft lounge which was nice  but below average for a 5 star Hotel! I had also organised a Pedicure for us three ladies, so we headed to the spa early so we could have a swim first, well the pool was freezing, so that counted that out...we all then headed to a very nice and peaceful room and awaited to be collected for our Pedicures. We were taken to another room, where there was a small chair in the cornor of the room with a plastic basin for my feet! I was shocked! this is not 5 star standards by any means! It was a quick wash and a polish for €60!!!!!! Well at least they have one thing right 5 star prices! 

My Dad tried to take a bath and the water was that dirty coming from the taps that he just had a quick shower. They did notify the front desk and were told that an engineer would come! Who never arrived...But no surprise there! 

We were all looking forward to finally getting some good service in Gordon Ramsey's Resturant....Think again! We arrived for our 7pm reservation and were seated. All was going very well we ordered Drinks and our meal...I was drinking a G&T which was taken from me before I finish, and I wasn't asked if I wanted another Drink! My Dad was only drinking water and had to keep asking for more water was never offered a drink. The one and only thing that Gordon got right in the restaurant was the food! Although the portions are VERY small it was a very good meal and no-one from our party left the resturant feeling hungry. I had ordered a Birthday cake, and for it to have Happy Birthday wrote on the cake...I had to asked the manager for the cake, which finally arrived with no writing but at least it arrived, We tried to order coffees from 3 waiters and finally we had to asked the manager to take our coffee order! which about 15mins after the three coffees finally arrived and where delivered by 5 wating staff and they still managed to forget the milk... We did complain to the manager who did give a 20% discount off the bill...This is not what we where looking for! We want a great meal and super service....This place is over the top and lacking the basics!!!! 

After our meal we all just wanted to forget about our experience and have a good nights sleep in the amazing beds, and no surprise again this didn't happen! There was a TV screen in our bathroom, nice touch if it worked! the screen was broken but the sound would come on every so often at a very high volume!!!!! Not even a good night sleep could we get in this Hotel!

I will never again visit or do I recommend anyone to take a weekend or any sort of trip to this Hotel.... 5 Star??? I don't think so and it's a disgrace that they should be allowed a 5 star rating!!!!",1,2008,05,19
217,5 star experience at 4 star prices,"After reading some of the recent reviews here it was with a certain amount of trepidation rather than joyful expectation that we approached our weekend stay at this hotel. Coupled with the fact that we were booked into Ramsay's on the Saturday night, well we were wondering if we shouldn't have stayed at home or at least stuck with our reguars of the Four Seasons or the Merrion for our trips to the Dublin area...
First impressions weren't great as we found the signposting to be quite poor ( blue signs rather than the standard brown signs denoting hotels etc in the R.O.I.) and after a detour found ourselves at the hotel entrance.. and waited..and waited.. With no sign of the promised ""valet"" parking we left our car and  made our way in with our luggage to the front desk... I was now SERIOUSLY concerned! Thankfully, an absolutely superb front-of-house put us immediately at ease, with charm & professionalism. We were shown to our room, which was a 6th. floor mountain view suite, and I must say, one of the nicest rooms I've stayed in. I had specifically asked for a high level, and the view was worth it, stunning. I guess the room was about 800 sq. feet, monstrous for two people. Bed was enormous, fixtures & fittings throughout were state-of-the-art, room electronics ( t.v., lights, a/c, curtains etc) controlled by a child-simple touch screen which pulls out from the bedside locker. 
We dined at Ramsay's, requested a window seat which we were duly seated at ( 15min wait, but it ain't McD's, comp canapes served). Food was superb, and as has been alluded to here not huge portions, but again it is supposed to be a gastronomic experience and not a chow-down! Room is quite bland though although the view we had was magnificent. What made the evening though was the superb service from the staff, this coupled with the delicious food would have me returning in the near future. Dinner for two, including a bottle of wine was €220.
We opted for room service breakfast, which arrived promptly at the specified time, and was fine. Only €4 extra, so avoid the buffet and really chill out.
Now the best part. For a comparable room at the Four Seasons in Dublin it would be €800-€1,000 per night (we just paid $1,600 per night for a two-bed suite in The Beverly Wilshire). The price here, per night, including breakfast for two, €375. Superb value.",5,2008,05,08
217,Disappointing,"Stayed here for one night. Our room was large, but the view advertised as garden is of the landscaping up to the car park. Great bathroom and bed, but the room decor was not nice. Breakfast was not 5 star standard - juice and pastries not fresh! We ate in Gordon Ramsay and found the food very good, but the overall experience disappointing due to an awful table (just inside the door with a constant stream of traffic behind us all night). The bill was close to 700 euro for an okay room and bad table in GR -- it didn't feel like a treat. In a new, purpose built hotel this was just not good enough.",3,2008,05,06
217,Will be great one day- lots of work to do.,"This will be fantastic when they get it right. Ritz Carlton are too respected a business to let the simple changes that stand in the way of making this new property much better than it currently is.

Having read the less favourable reviews and stayed there this weekend I can only conclude that they are very fair and my advice is not to stay here until the reviews get better (and management have addressed the shortcomings).

The property, spa, rooms and settings are first class. The service is also friendly and the staff are well trained. The issue is just that the hotel athmosphere doesnt quite work and its all down to the food and the bar areas.

Despite paying $500 per night for BB, the lobby appeared to be full of day trippers with their young children taking over the armchairs. At night the place was soul less and the Irish pub felt like something you would see at an airport (complete with a $30 burger). 

I think the hotel needs to decide is it a 4 star in a nice setting or a 5 star fist class experience. if it is the latter then they need to sort out the food. Breakfast is very very very poor - it is a buffet which is badly cooked food which you then stand around a single toaster. It is 2-3 star at best and I am shocked that this is served in a Gordon Ramsey branded room (although the fruit is excellent). It really felt like someone had bought the food at a supermarket and microwaved it - for the rates they charge it should be menued tabled service.

However, I would be willing to return when it gets better which Im sure it will - the prices just dont offer value until then.

Spa is excellent though - first class.",2,2008,05,05
217,I now wish I was RICH!!!,"My husand and I stayed at the Ritz-Carlton, Powerscourt as part of a package purchased through Aer Lingus Vacations.  Up front I should say that while we like to splurge occasionally on 5-star hotels, we have never stayed at a Ritz-Carlton before.

After spending the afternoon at Powerscourt House & Gardens, we checked in to the hotel.  I have no idea why (and I was afraid to ask), but we were upgraded to a suite.  It was a slice of heaven.  (I love the personal touch of the TV welcoming you personally to your room.  Ha!)  The rooms were large and we had a beautiful view of Sugar Loaf from the veranda.  The suite had a sitting / working room, 2 bathrooms, bedroom, and a dressing room.    

Even apart from upgrading us, I thought the staff at the front desk was incredibly nice and helpful.  We got lost in the hotel looking for the pub and a nice gentleman that worked there, not only directed us, but escorted us, which I thought was a great touch.  We did not use the spa or eat at Gordon Ramsay's for dinner, but had the buffet breakfast there.  I guess it surprised me a little bit that the breakfast was buffet (I'm not a big fan of the buffet in general), but the selection was great and the food was good.  I thought the service was impeccable.

I had the best night's sleep of our week in Ireland in the big, comfortable bed and I LOVED the shower.  It was in it's own ""room"" with the huge shower head on the ceiling.  It was so refreshing I used it twice.

The only negative thing I really have to say is that I'm surprised a hotel of this standard still feels it necessary to charge for phone calls and internet access.  I mean, seriously, $400-$500 / night isn't enough to cover a toll-free call?  I was charged .35 euro to call the Aer Lingus toll-free number to try to confirm our airline reservation for the next day.  They ended up taking it off at the front desk when we checked out, even though I was prepared to pay, so again, I thought that was a nice touch.  The principle, however, is still that I think the ""nickel and diming"" is unnecessary.

When we checked in, they informed us that the a/c had not been working.  Our room was a little stuffy.  We went into town for dinner and came back to find it still stuffy, but as soon as I called the front desk, the problem was remedied.  Again, I thought the service was perfect.

Overall, a great stay.",5,2008,05,04
217,Fabulous,"Myself and my husband stayed for two nights midweek.  We found all the staff extremely friendly and efficent throughout the length of our stay.  We have stayed in many five star hotels (mostly in USA) over the past year and have to say that this was our favourite.  The bedroom was spacious, clean and beautifully decorated.  We had breakfast in bed the first morning which was delicious and the second morning in Ramsey's restaurant which was good too although the service was a little lacking.  We also had dinner one night in the restaurant and found it quite disappointing.  Although I did like the atmosphere and the friendly waiting staff, I found the food to be very average and much more about presentation than the actual flavours and taste.  I would definately recommend the hotel and hope to be back in the not to distant future (hence why i gave an excellent rating above) but this time i'd give Gordon Ramsey's a miss !!  Would also recommend the Avoca Cafe - devine !!",5,2008,04,30
217,Gordon Ramsey's is a let down,"This is a beautiful hotel in a beautiful location but I was left feeling that I didn't quite get what I paid for.  

I cannot fault the bedrooms or the staff (if anything they are overly attentive) but you are just left with the impression that the hotel was rushed to completion. For example at least 3 door handles came off in my hand, including the main door to the Health & Fitness area.

When myself and my husband booked our weekend break for March we also booked a table at Gordon Ramsey's Restaurant.

From my understanding of Gordan Ramsey's ethos and the Ritz Hotel standards,  my expectation was for great food that would come in adaquate portion sizes and that would be served in a tasteful, ambiant environment

What I received was a table just inside a glass partition, in full view of the guests coming up and down the stairs.  There also seemed to be an elevator on the other side of this partition  and it appears that quests in the hotel were using the restaurant as a short cut to get from their rooms to the hotel bar just down the corridor from the restaurant

The food was fussy, over complicated and the portion sizes were so small I was still hungry after the meal.  I have dined in many restaurants throughout Europe and it is the first time I have ever felt let down by a restaurant.  I will not make a return visit to this or any other Gordon Ramsey restaurant.

You can expect to pay approximately 100 euro per person without wine for this experience (just make sure you fill up on the bread)

On a plus side the treatments in the health spa are wonderful.  They, again, were overpriced, but the staff are wonderful.

In summary, go to the hotel if you want a beautiful, comfortable room in a wonderful location.  But if I did again I would brunch in Avoca and dine out in the eveing. 

On the money you save by not dining in Ramsey's - get yourself a facial.",3,2008,04,28
217,"Great hotel, some teething problems","My wife and I stayed here in March for a weekend and we really enjoyed our stay.  The rooms are beautiful and spacious, rooms facing sugar loaf mountain have great views and are worth the extra.

Concierege was very helpful effieicntly responding by email before we arrived to arrange transfers and trips while we were there.

If you wish to eat at Gordon Ramsey's BOOK WELL BEFORE YOU ARRIVE.  We booked a couple of months ahead and enjoyed a fantastic meal.  Other dining options are ok.  Service is generally very good and is always with a smile.  Some staff were so new they didnt have all the info at hand.

Only downside is that being a new hotel the atmoshpere sometimes can feel a bit hollow, but thats a small price to pay for such nice rooms and good facilities.  

I took the risk of ignoring the m ixed reviews and we had a great time.  We will probably return some time later this year.",5,2008,04,27
217,"What can I say, another lovely stay in the Ritz Carlton Powerscourt.","What can I say, another lovely stay in the Ritz Carlton Powerscourt.

Stayed here for the first time a few months ago with work and it was just as nice this time.

Rooms are fabulous – even the basic room is like a mini suite
Staff are great
Location is very nice but the building is so new the trees etc are very small and it needs a few years to mature and the hotel is a bit quite and soulless

The spa is over priced but my girl liked it and thought it was wonderful – but I don’t get the idea of spas anyway so if you like spas apparently it is very good but not all facilities – there were more in the four seasons

Swimming pool and stream room area is really special 

All in all very nice",4,2008,04,22
217,Lack of Substance,"My husband and I booked into The Ritz-Carlton for St. Patrick's Weekend in March, looking forward to a few days of  pure luxury and pampering. We are very familiar with County Wicklow and the very popular Powerscourt Estate and just wanted to stay some where, where we could truly unwind.  When travelling we stay in five star establishments as we believe one pays for what one gets and prefer to pay top dollar so one eliminates any potential disapointments and we thought that the Ritz-Carlton would be a safe bet.   This philosophy has always worked until this occasion.

The hotel is what I would call skin deep, luxurious decor, but nothing behind it.  A very disingenuous place.  We have never stayed in such a soul less hotel.  The only jewel worth talking about is Gordon Ramsay's Restaurant. Itwas truly excellent, in terms of both menu and service.  It turned out that this restaurant is the only restaurant in the hotel and at that, it is not very large.  The restaurant is very popular with non residents and the hotel does not seem to have a policy where they keep a certain number of tables aside for residents.  Fortunately we had reserved a table for Saturday night a month in advance and the only reservation available was for 1830hrs.  Breakfast is served in the same restaurant and no effort is taken to make it feel a little different from the night before.  The standard of breakfast menu, presentation and food was very poor.  There was no hint of an American style breakfast, what was there was an attempt of the Irish/continental, but not even cooked nicely.  On Sunday evening,our only option in the hotel was to dine in what they call the brasserie, (they could only confirm our reservation at 2000hrs that night for 2030hrs as it was fully booked earlier in the day). The brasserie consists of two small alcoves off the main lounge area, it has a very limited menu but what we got was good.  The public areas in the hotel are very limited and throughout the day the hotel is busy with non residents. There is a club members lounge upstairs but only for club members.  So the only quiet area for non club members is in ones bedroom.  

Through out the hotel (except for Ramsay's restaurant at nightand the spa facilities) one is lucky to meet a member of staff who can understand English let alone speak it  properly to be able to offer any decent standard of service.
Those whom we met act as though they have been taught to have a very informal air about them and they all use the same few phrases which do not fit in with the surroundings.
 
We pulled up at the main entrance on Saturday morning and were left waiting for over five mintues before we were offered help with our luggage. One porter was on the door and he was busy with another customer.  While left waiting he didn't even acknowlege our existance.  

We checked in and were given a key and directions to our room.  We were very happy with the layout of the room, decor, dressing area and bathroom.  The one complaint I would have is that it does not have a sound system where one can plug in ones i-pod.
At 1730hrs I decided to have a bath, when to my horror I noticed it was filthy with a thick line of scumb.  I rang housekeeping immediately to be told they would send somebody up straight away.  I rang another two or three times and still nobody arrived. Finally I had to give up and have a shower as our dinner reservation was for 1830hrs.  (we were here supposedly to relax!).  Upon returning from dinner at 2300hrs it had still not been cleaned.  Mistakes can be made but it is how one rectifies them that is important.  They totally failed.

The spa facilites are extremely poor.  There are plenty of extremely expensieve treatments but I certainly did not feel encouraged to try any of them considering the standard of service in the remaining parts of the hotel.  So if one does not have a treament one has only access to the pool, which is very average (no natural light or views, bearing in mind that the hotel is in the 'Garden of Ireland), the gym which was at a freezing temperature, the whirl pool/jaccuzi which was on the cool side and the steam room which was fair, nothing special.  We were told there is a sauna but one must have a treament to use it.

The hotel has an identity crises which we felt throughout our stay.  It cannot decide weather it is American or Irish and on top of that it has non Americans or non Irish working though out it, trying to deliver the mixed-up culture.  It has been designed predominently with the American market in mind, trying to offer a 'flavour' of Ireland which comes across as so false.  I only heard one or two Amercian accents.   It would be much better if it acted like a true American on all levels and do what the Americans do best ie American breakfast/brunch etc.  

We left earlier than planned on the Monday and upon checking out my husband was asked for his comments.  He did not give any at that moment as a hotel which truly cared about customer service  would have a comment sheet and the previous guest had complaints and the receptionist was writing them on a scrap of paper.

My rating on the hotel and facilities and service would be one out of ten.  The Gordon Ramsay Restaurant (at night only) would be nine out of ten.

So much money has been spent on the decor but it becomes meaningless when the very basics of customer service have been sacrificed.

If you truly value how you spend your hard earned money I certainly would not recommend that you stay there.  Visit Gordon Ramsay's restaurant bur forget the rest!",1,2008,04,10
217,Enjoyable,"Amazing setting as you drive up to the hotel- a little bit of heaven. Check in was quick, was shown to the lift and offer to be taken to the room - but declined.  Room was amazing, bathrooms was even better - toiletries was really lush, so yes many baths were had with a glass of wine, watching the tv which was located in the mirror. 

Breakfast the following morning was lovely, the fruits and pastries.  I was very suprised that a 5 star, gorden ramsey restaurant used ""chaffing dishes"" for the cooked breakfasts and that no menus were presented, it was take it or leave it option. I thought at least the coffee would have been poured and not put on the table ( not even a sideplate for the pot) 

Harpest was playing the the lobby that evening i could have listened all day - but was rushing around as it was a working trip.  So i retired back to my room to do emails - shock horror it was looking for credit card details to log on, i've stayed in 3 stars that don't even charge you, so i said i'd head to the business center and yet again i was to be charged.  On my final morning i went to check out, my bill stated that they was 2 in the room i explained that it was only one person ( i also said this 2 days prior and it wasn't changed).  I was rudly told that was the rate regardless, i explained a colleague was in another room at €25 cheaper a night, to be told she was on room only and i was on B&B which i knew was incorrect as i made the origional booking. After 5 mins of ""Tuts and huffing"" from the receptionist she finally altered the rate.  

Maybe i caught them on a bad weekend but the only reason i'll be going back to Powerscourt is to visit the AVOCA cafe and the gardens.",2,2008,04,01
217,fantastic break,"My self and my girlfriend stayed in this hotel for two nights, and I have to say the whole experience was fantastic from start to finish.  The staff were very friendly and helpful, the food in Gordon Ramsey’s was everything I expected and more, we had the tasting menu which is well worth paying the extra for.  the only down side of the whole two day was the food in the bar, not only was it not good to eat but it was vastly over priced even for a hotel of its nature. To summarise I would defiantly recommend this hotel and I will defiantly be going back but aviod the food in the bar and go for Gordons every time",5,2008,03,23
217,Putting on the Ritz,"Booked a night in the Ritz-Carlton to enjoy the whole 'Gordon Ramsay' experience.  Our intention was essentially to enjoy a luxury break and ultimately to learn what  'a five star dining experience' really entails. The standard of service was extremely professional from the moment of our arrival. Not enough superlatives can apply to the room in which we stayed (there was an upgrade package available when we booked). Gorgeous toiletries, robes, slippers, the works (better half is a builder and not a man for potions and lotions,  but even he  loved the showergel !) No coffee-making facilities in the room, but cafetiers and teapots were provided; along with kettle on request.
Meal reservation was for nine, but our table did not appear to be ready and therefore we were invited to have a drink while we waited. A ten minute wait was by no means an issue to us as we could chat and people-watch. My more well-heeled/travelled friends have told me since that the drinks should have been complimentary given that our table was not ready at the appointed time, however, we were not in any particular rush and had enjoyed the pool and spa facilities earlier that evening (more on that later) and thus were extremely relaxed. My only niggle was that we were hungry and a few 'nibbles' during the wait might have tided us over... The service during the evening  was faultless and the wine list extensive if not somewhat overwhelming to say the least. In commenting on the food,  my ignorance becomes very apparent. J and I enjoy eating out. We both know what we like and can tell good food from that which is not great however, the waiting staff spent a considerable amount of time explaining what each dish was when they presented it before us, and to be frank or ignorant (take your pick) the complexity of the dish as explained by the waiters didn't correspond to the experience of  its consumption. (Again perhaps my palette in not sufficiently refined to appreciate what I ate, but I speculate that some of my fellow-diners' palettes may also be akin to my own.) The food was terrific but I have had some equally enjoyable meals elsewhere with less of the fanfare. The dining experience as such was truly memorable.
I enjoyed a blissful massage in the spa, and both of us spent a few hours in the pool area. The lighting in the pool area is dark without being austere and adds to an atmosphere of relaxation. We loved the hamam area. 
In fact, we loved this hotel so much that we opted to stay for another night. On our second night, neither of us wanted to eat anything as rich as the night before. We had eaten a substantial lunch in the lovely Avoca restaurant in the Powerscourt estate earlier and were peckish rather than ravenous. A plate of chips would have sufficed me. Service for said chips and a salad was friendly and professional but slow. The waitress seemed to be alone in catering for a relatively large group of diners with a similar appetite to mine! Pub was closed it being Good Friday (no pub-grub on offer) and the Sugarloaf Lounge/Restaurant' s menu appeared quite heavy.  The chips were tepid and not particularly appetising but the wine and company more than compensated.
Breakfast the following morning was a treat.. Service as always exacting, professional but friendly.
Leaving the hotel was not easy. (The not-inconsiderable bill had to be paid)! We genuinely had one of the best 2 night breaks ever here. Beautiful, scenic location, luxurious bedrooms attentive staff, wonderful leisure facilities and food to write home about/ if not to talk about. 
We will be back. I would suggest to anyone considering a stay in  this hotel to make the reservation. You will not leave disappointed.",5,2008,03,22
217,Improving hotel,"I stayed here for the second time in two months in January 2008 and was curious to see if some of the chinks in the Ritz Carlton armour had been smoothed out in the few months that had elapsed since my last visit.

In general I found the staff to be very friendly this time around. There seemed to be relatively few guests staying on the cold icy Thursday night so those that were there were being looked after well. The food throughout the conference was very good although I've had better breakfasts in lesser hotels.

Once again the room was fantastic with extremely comfortable beds and top quality bathrooms. I stayed in a corner room which was somewhat unusual in that it had a corridor that navigated 180 degrees from the door to the living area. I'm not sure who thought of the idea of placing the TV facing the desk rather than the bed but it was bit awkward to pivot the TV 90 degrees to face the bed due to the layout of the room. This time around I was familiar with the electronic gadgetry to open curtains and turn off the lights without too much difficulty.

The bar was popular enough and is fairly cosy, an important factor in this out of town location on a winter's night. I doubt it gets too much passing trade so whatever athmosphere there is has to come from the hotel or conference guests.

All in all, a very nice hotel in a pleasant, if out of the way, location.",4,2008,02,26
217,Amazing Hotel and  Superb Service,"We spent a weekend break in the hotel - it is a fantastic hotel, true oppulence throughout, the staff were extremely helpful in every way - we ate in McGills one evening and the food was very good. The breakfast is served in the Gordon Ramsay restaurant and it is devine - a great selection of everything you could think of  -the blueberry muffins melt in your mouth! We ate in Emilia's Restaurant in the village - a lovely Italian restaurant.  Our room was beautiful, the bed was so comfortable you don't ever want to get out of it. Remote control curatins, lights, do not disturb and aircon an added bonus! The location is amazing - beside Powerscourt house and gardens worth the 5.50 euro entrance fee. Overall we had a fantastic time in a beautiful hotel.",5,2008,02,19
217,Restaurant very Poor,"This hotel is not at the standard of any Ritz Carlton I have been at before in terms of food. The building is magnificant and the views are lovely etc.., but the food is frankly shocking. We had to queue up for breakfast for 15 minutes ! This hotel seriously needs an injeciton of management skill from someone in a proper Ritz Carlton.",3,2008,02,17
217,Fantastic,"The hotel is an oasis outside Dublin. It's a magical hotel with great views in a real pituresque area of Wicklow, not far from Dublin.

A great place for business or pleasure!

The service was fantastic and the staff do whatever they can to make your stay as enjoyable as possible. Paul in reception was particularly helpful.

The only reservation I would have about the place is that the Gordon Ramsay restaurant is very pricey and busy. But you can get a great meal in the lounge or resisdents bar.",5,2008,02,01
217,amazing hotel!!,"its an amazing hotel, i read all the reviews from this website after i had it booked and after reading some of them i nearly cancelled it but something told me not too, boy was i glad i didnt, we stayed here after new years, the hotel is top five star class, we stayed in one of the suites, oh my god you felt like royalty, i did book the gordon restaurant in advance and dinner was fantastic, service was amazing and the food is to die for!!! pool etc is fab, and there,s gardens just a five min walk away from hotel which can be nice and romantic for a little stroll, overall the best hotel in ireland by far, if you want to really treat yourself for something special stay here, and it is very reasonable for what you get",5,2008,01,28
217,Back in Florida but my heart is still at the Ritz,"Just returned from a 3 night stay at this lovely hotel, celebrating an anniversary so the reason for coming in January. Upgraded to a suite that was bigger than our first house, given long stem roses on the bed, champagne, and strawberries and chocolate, what could be better. The checkin was what you expect from a Ritz Carlton, escorted by the gentleman who checked us in, he showed us all that the suite had to offer, absolute luxury, lush bedding, the master bath the size of a NY apartment, in mirror TV , plus two additional flat screens in the living area and bedroom, even had a small dressing room with vanity and mirror. Lovely....touch screen in-room controls and since we were at the end of the hallway, a wrap around balcony at least 20 ft long with outside seating. The lobby is grand, yet inviting to have a seat and warm up to the fireplaces, or have tea. Only ate at McGill's the hotel pub which opens at 1630 but doesn't serve food until 1800. We enjoyed our meal and the friendly chatty bartenders/servers, would have liked more of a menu selection though, very small menu. The weather wasn't co-operating so we didn't get to enjoy the Powerscourt Estate and Gardens, next time we will be back in the warmer months. Bring your bathing suits the indoor pool is an experience not to be missed and children are only allowed in the pool at restricted hours so adults can relax and enjoy the total spa experience and be reminded why they are on vacation. Book a spa appointment you won't regret it. One happy side note for those who hate to be forced to valet park, there is free self parking (rare at Ritz Carlton)but valet is there if you wish. Unless I missed it there were not shops in the hotel, which is a missed opportunity, who goes to Ireland without buying something? Really wish we were still there and enjoying the staff, and quality of the 5 star service, the opening jitters of the hotel are gone. Can't wait to return",5,2008,01,26
217,Sheer Opulence!,"I stayed here on Saturday 19 January as part of a conference for work and fortunately can say that i had a wonderful time without having to put my hand in my pocket!!  I am sure the rooms are expensive but they are very definitely worth it.  They are big, clean and very stylish(in the traditional way). No fewer than three plasma tvs and a bed that you could practically live in. However, no tea/coffee making facilities or complimentary water which no matter how posh anyone is can take a little bit away from the comfort.  The lifts are also confusing as previously mentioned. The service was excellent, sincere  and generally the staff seemed happy to be there!  All our food was laid on so no idea how Ramsay's restaurant stacked up.  Like mentioned before the breakfast whilst ample was disappointing in the sense that it should be cooked to order.  I would happily return as the hotel would certainly impress my wife!!I consider myself to be a discerning visitor and can honestly recommend this hotel.",5,2008,01,20
217,Whats not to love!?,"This hotel might be pricey but the saying that you get what you pay for has never been truer. This hotel is stunning in every way. It is spotless, beautiful, relaxing and the staff are very helpful.
Me and my Fiance stayed here for one night in January and we didn't want to go home. We had a mountain view suite which had every mod con you could ask for and the Suite was beautiful and romantic. The hotel has wonderful resturants and a traditional Irish Pub in the centre of it, which is great craic. I would reccommend this hotle to anyone!",5,2008,01,14
217,Love it - ignore the negatives - must of being teething problems!!,"my fiance surprised me with a trip here as a christmas present and it was just fabulous. i really don't understand all the negative reviews as our stay was amazing. he had booked a suite and the prestige menu in gordon ramsays for dinner. 

I'll try and keep this brief - we were in a suite on the second floor and it was bigger than our apartment!! we had 3 tvs - including one in the bathroom set into the mirror. the bed was fabulous - massive and very comfy (possibly too soft) and we had lots of space. on the negative, we had a kitchen - but it had NOTHING in the drawers - no glasses,cutlery, plates etc. i queried this with reception and they said that that was correct. we had a fully blown expensive coffee maker - but no cups!! reception informed me that the suites were like that with a view to offering a kitchen facility to longer term guests in the future. I then asked about tea/coffee facilities and was advised that there was none but room service would be happy to deliver. I hate this - you're paying a fortune for a room/suite and they still try and screw you out of a coffee. 

anyway other than the tea/coffee issue, the service was excellent (except for 1 grumpy chap in mcgills - the pub), the atmosphere was excellent, dinner in GR's was SUBLIME, and the spa was amazing. 

I can understand a crowded lobby when the hotel first opened as us Irish can be very nosy and the first Ritz would demand a lot of attention and locals coming in for ""afternoon tea"" and taking over the place. However, things seem to have calmed down.

Make sure you bring your swimware, gym gear and go for a spa treatment if you can afford it. All the facilites in the spa are fantastic and you'll want to use all of them!! 

I would definitely like to stay here again (if I could justify the expense when I live 30 minutes away) but I will definitely be back for dinner in GRs.",5,2008,01,08
217,Amazing,Myself and five friends stayed at the hotel for a night over Christmas and it was fabulous.  Ok it's expensive but in my opinion was worth every penny.  It was sheer luxury.  The staff were excellent and more than helpful.  I am already planning a return trip to the hotel I loved it so much.  Avoca is a short step away and the gardens in Powerscourt are on the doorstep.  I would definitely recommend the hotel.,5,2008,01,04
217,Loved it,"My husband and I stayed here as a treat for our anniversary.  On booking the hotel, we requested a booking at the Gordon Ramsay restaurant - the main reason we were going.  Our request was not acknowledged and it took a number of e-mails and phone calls to get the matter resolved - I was fuming at that stage, but when the matter was referred to Powerscourt as opposed to the global Ritz, we received some very polite calls, the problem was sorted out and we received an apology for the inconvenienced, followed with up a letter.   
We did have terrible problems finding the place - mainly caused by our sat-nav taking us to Powerscourt Demesne and then we had to go over Sally Gap to get there - I'm not a fan of scenic routes, being terribly afraid of heights - I spent most of the journey close to tears, tensed up beyond belief!  
However, all that disappeared when we got to hotel.  The foyer/reception is just fabulous.  Our room was on 4th floor, which is where reception is as well.  The corridor down to the room is just great - nice and wide, doors set back which makes it seem more spacious and the carpet is great.  Our room was equally wonderful, the very big bed looked like a little blip - the room itself was so big.  Loved the bathroom, and it's so spacoius.  The wardrobe area is fabulous too, but when we were only staying 1 night, we didn't really make much use ot if, other than pulling out the ironing board and now having to walk around it later!   We went down the McGills to get some food - we had been travelling much longer than planned and were starving.  Had fish & chips, which were quite nice, but I would have to say probably over-priced for what they were.  Still they were nicely presented, we enjoyed them and we were at the Ritz.....  We had 2 drinks there, and while we didn't have any trouble getting served, there was another person there who was getting quite irate about having to wait so long.  Watching the service there for the time we were there, it is certainly slow.  There was a staff member came on as we were finishing up and he was much better, looking for customers, looking as if he was movign quickly etc.  I liked the bar,  but I can appreciate why people mightn't.  We then decided to have a cup of coffee at the Sugar Loaf and browse the papers.  It's fine, nothing wrong with it, but wouldn't be a fan either.  Then went to get changed - I loved that shower - loved the whole bathroom!  We had a drink at the Sugar Loaf before goign for dinner.  This time, there was something wrong - loads of kids making loads of noise.  At first I thought there wre all with one man who was ordering at the bar, and then I noticed him ordering more than 1 alcolhic drink.  I then realised that the parents were outside the area enjoying their drinks with the kids inside.  We don't have kids ourselves and would be less tolerant than many of this.  I was very glad to see one of the waitresses speak to another adult that had just come in, at which point she went over to the kids and told them they'd been asked to keep down the noise.  We left soon after that to have dinner.  
Dinner was fabulous.  I was slightly worried that I wouldn't liek anything, as there are lots of foods I don't like!!  But I actually had a choice!  I had risotta to start.  I have often listened to/watched Gordon Ramsay on TV and eating that risotta I understood what he means about flavours and tasting different things in food etc - it was to die for.  I had fillet of beef then and it was lovelyl but nothing was going to match the risotta.  Overall, we had a thoroughly enjoyable evening, good food, great service.
The only down-side to the whole experience was the next morning.  We came down for breakfast at 10:25 - served until 10:30!!  We came down to a queue!  I couldn't beleive it - and we queued there for about 30 minutes.  I wasn't that hungry and could easily have skipped breakfast but I watned to see what it was like and then of course I got stubborn!  I don't know what the delay was, there seemed to be tables free inside.  When we got in, there were a number of unused tables nearby, so why we had to queue for so long.....  It was all badly organised.  Breakfast was fine, some of it lovely, some of it just nice.  Service wasn't great, lot of staff there, but they didn't seem to be looking after anyone.  it wouldn't stop me going back, but I think I'd order room service next time - or get down much earlier for breakfast!!!
We plan to go back - maybe in summer when we can enjoy the grounds and the fabulous scenery!",5,2008,01,03
217,Don't Bother....,"This is a wonderful building in quite the most beautiful landscaped setting, high up in the rolling Wicklow Mountains of Ireland.  It ought to be the perfect luxury fireside Christmas getaway.   In fact it’s a disaster.  A very expensive disaster.   You pay top dollar for such luxury hotel experiences but here, they do not allow guests to use the Hotel restaurant.  Good food and silver service are NOT AVAILIBLE.  There is no room at the inn for paying guests.  Instead you are sent off to look for pubs in the nearby villages or directed down to the in-house “pub”, a noisy, backpacker standard basement bar where the food is third rate and the service almost, but not quite up to third rate.   It would appear the restaurant facility is booked out for months ahead by non-residents, so stuff the paying guests!  

Hotels of this standard and price ought to offer a luxury experience.  In fact I left the place with a burning resentment at having spent a small fortune for a luxury break and having been denied the use of a decent restaurant.   They clearly think their restaurant is a fine attraction.  I don’t know what kind of reviews it is getting but what they have here as a hotel product seems to be a restaurant with some rooms attached but the people staying at the rooms are not allowed into the restaurant.  A disaster. An utter disaster. 

I don’t know what other Ritz-Carlton Hotels are like but I do know that the Powerscourt version will not see my money again.  If you are thinking of booking, well my advice is don’t.   Not unless they absolutely guarantee you a place in their restaurant.",1,2007,12,31
217,Fantastic stay - but don't eat there!,"We stayed at the Ritz for the Friday and Saturday night before xmas. We have previously stayed at the Ritz Carlton in New York which was just outstanding. No expense has been spared at the Ritz Carlton in Wicklow. We had two rooms on the third floor. Our room did not have a balcony but the other two in our party had a balcony -both rooms were at the same rate. It was freezing anyway so the balcony was a luxury that we could not take advantage of. The rooms are pure luxury. You could spend the entire weekend in the beds-they are soooo comfortable.............not least because of the pillows which must be the softest pillows I have ever laid my head on. The plasma TV in the bathroom is a great luxury- a gimmick but nonetheless useful when you are trying to get ready for a night out and keep up to speed with TV at the same time.!!!! The showers are just the right heat with power which is plentiful. The spa, pool and sauna/steam room must be experienced to be believed-outstanding! We didn't want to leave! The grounds are magnificent and a few hours should most definitely be set aside for exploring them. Our two issues with the hotel were 1) On checking out we learned we had to pay for parking (not a major issue but nonetheless should not be the case in a 5*) and 2) We ate in the Suger loaf Bistro on the Friday night and left a fine sum there but we could have eaten better for one third of what it cost us. A rack of lamb consisted of two pieces of lamb!!! We were NOT impressed with the food and indeed the service. The staff (2 non national ladies) that were on duty appeared to be more keen on having their own discussions rather than serving the customers, even though there were only two tables occupied on the night-ours and another party. Apart from that the staff at the hotel were fantastic and really pleasant. They could not have been more helpful. Also as a final note Enniskerry is a really beautiful village and so peaceful-well worth strolling around there for a few hours.",5,2007,12,28
217,top class,"stunning drive up to the hotel and you are not disappointed once inside the front door - beautifully decorated for christmas time. stayed in a suite which was amazing, 3 rooms, heated tiles in bathroom with TV in the mirror and a bed that you never want to get out of! Service was first class, as you expect from a Ritz. Stayed in the Ritz in Kuala Lumpar and good and all as that was, this was better.",5,2007,12,20
217,overall disappointed,"Myself and my wife stayed at the Hotel November 30th for one night.Fiirst impressions as we drove up were wow what a set up.On pulling up to the front door we were greeted by a very pleasant consierge who offered to carry our bags and park the car. Good start. We were pointed to the lifts as  our room was on the 6th floor which was 2 floors up because the reception is on the 4th floor and the Spa is on the 1st floor which is in the basement confused so were we. Ah the lifts. We were pointed to a corridor which contained 2 lifts beside each other.One went to the 7th floor and one only to the 5th. No matter how many times you pressed the button  only the lift on the right would open which only went to the 5th floor so we had to get out on the 5th floor and pick up the other lift to the 6th floor. The room was fantastic  large plasma T.V. and a bed you dont want to get out of.
Only fault no complimentry water or tea or coffee.The famous Ramsay Restaurant was a joke I have had nicer Pub Grub. Small portions and large prices nothing to write home about.
And finally Breakfast what  a total waste of time.We had to wait outside for 15 minutes to be seated For a 5 star hotel you would think it would be cooked fresh. None of it a slapped together buffet cold under cooked and over priced at €35. They have a €350 Breakfast on the menu I shudder to think what that would be like. All in all for all the hype about this Hotel I will never set foot in it ever again simply a JOKE.",1,2007,12,03
217,Loved it - even with some issues!,"I felt very apprehensive about staying at Powerscourt after the ""terrible"" reviews and wondered if I should spend my money at the many fabulous hotels in Dublin.

I am glad I decided to go to Powerscourt as it is a magnificent building on beautiful acres of grounds.

As any new hotel there will always be ""teething"" problems and I unfortunately did encounter a few minor issues - however the oppulence of the hotel, the most fabulous rooms - I stayed in a suite which was huge with all the essentials you would expect in a 5* hotel - some extras are TV in bathroom mirror, heated bathroom floor and the most fabulous crisp Egyptian cotton linen.

Spa - lovely pool and spa facilities with extra spa facilities upstairs if you have a treatment and staff very helpful and friendly.

McGills bar - interesting opening times - 2pm and start seving food 4pm but overall a good lively and non stuffy bar.

Service - very good with multi-lingual staff throughout hotel.

Gordon Ramsay - food I felt was excellent and well priced for the ""kudos"" of the restaurant and located within 5* hotel. Only downfall I felt was it was too big and when tables of 4+ were being served food there was alot of commotion between staff with what food went where! 

Downfall - no water in bedrooms or tea/coffee making facilities which I feel is very poor for an hotel of this class.

Overall i would recommend this hotel as I feel it has all the luxuries to offer, beautiful grounds to walk, lovely rooms and beds which you will sleep soundly in and either nouvelle cuisine food @ GR's or good old pub grub.

I look forward to returning",5,2007,12,02
217,Forget minimalism,"After booking a night in a garden view suite and dinner in Gordon Ramsey, I read some bad reviews on Trip Advisor. This was a 50th birthday surprise for my husband so naturally I was anxious to make it special and arrived last Wednesday with some trepidation! This was quickly dispelled as the doorman opened the car door for me, unloaded the luggage and whisked the car away. The receptionists welcomed my husband with ""Happy Birthday,"" we were taken to our suite with our luggage ( one of my pet hates is having to wait ages for this to be delivered) and shortly after an ice bucket, 2 flutes, a bottle of champagne, a bowl of strawberries and a birthday message were delivered with the hotel's compliments. All good so far!
The suite was beautiful - large plasma screens in both rooms plus one in the centre of the bathroom mirror, touch pads at both sides of the bed to open & close the drapes, adjust the heating etc.  Enough to keep us occupied so that we didn't need to look at the ""garden view"" - a large white wall unless you lean well out to see the rest! The bathroom was beautiful and well stocked with Bulgari toiletries.
The hotel's decor is very traditional - forget minimalism! It could have been furnished 20 years ago and still looked the same.
Now to the spa! What an incredible place! Absolutely fabulous experience and that was without having any treatments! If you're coming to stay here save up and have SOMETHING done!
Dinner in Gordon Ramsey was lovely - excellent service and delicious food in an unstuffy atmosphere.
Breakfast was a somewhat different experience,sadly. The buffet section is wonderful with every type of fresh fruit on offer. However it took 20 minutes for our cooked food to appear and that was after complaining. We also had to point out that our neighbouring tables had still not been cleared after 30 mins - not a pleasant sight first thing!
To be fair they did apologise and try to make amends.
Any problems we encountered were really teething ones, and I'm thankful that I can tell Trip Advisor members to book with confidence. If something's wrong, complain, but then I'm sure TA members are good at that!
All in all, Ritz Carlton do have a world class hotel here - as long as they can get the staff!!",5,2007,11,26
217,Excellent but will improve further,"We stayed for a Saturday night in November, and had a really excellent stay.  The  rooms were very large - we were upgraded to an extremely spacious suite but we saw a standard room as well.  The staff were extremely good and attentive, right up there with the best anywhere in the world.  The restaurant was as good, or better, as you would expect from Gordon Ramsey.  But things did go wrong in some areas of the hotel, that would not be acceptable in a five star hotel normally, but which might be excused because it's open for only a few weeks at this stage.  One of our party was told their room was not ready even though they arrived at 5pm!  Our dinner reservation was lost.  The locks on the room were persistently problematic.     And the signage, particularly on the lifts, was disastrous.  We spent a lot of time getting out of lifts and wandering corridors trying to find where we were going. And our bill was not correct.  These are presumably teething problems and will be sorted in time.  More seriously, perhaps, is the fact that there is only one restaurant, and that is very definitely a fine dining restaurant.  If staying for a few days you would certainly not eat there every night.  Still, we loved it, and we will certainly go back!",5,2007,11,18
217,"Great spot to chill out, eat, drink and be pampered","Having read a few of the reviews here I was a bit concerned about the trip I had booked with my boyfriend to Powerscourt. I need not have worried! I guess some of the folks had booked in on day one or two, but the problems had clearly been ironed out by the time we arrived. 

The positives: extremely pleasant staff, the best restaurant meal I have EVER eaten in Ireland at Gordon Ramsay's (and at €65 a head for lunch and a couple of glasses of wine I was surprised at how cheap) - go on, try the pork belly!! (but book early), enormous rooms, a beautiful spa area, great beds, and best of all, the most serene hotel surroundings this side of Monart.

It's a new hotel so will always develop into it's surroundings, but we loved every minute of it - great for walks, golfing or just a happy potter down to the local pub before heading back to chill out. We'll be back as soon as we can!",5,2007,11,13
217,Enchanting place,"My husband treated me to a weekend away at the Ritz Carlton Powerscourt for our first wedding anniversary. Everything about the stay was absolutely perfect. The staff were extremely friendly and professional - nothing was too much trouble. Although it is a very luxurious 5-star property, it has a warm and welcoming feel from the moment of arrival. The beautiful views of the Sugarloaf create a stunning backdrop. We had an exquisite lunch in Gordon Ramsay - I can honestly say it was one of the best meals I've enjoyed in years. We were pleasantly surprised by the reasonable set lunch menu which was great value. We also enjoyed a relaxing few pints in McGills, the local pub which is part of the hotel, which has more in the way of character than your standard hotel bar. The leisure suite and swimming pool were fabulous - definitely the nicest I have seen. I couldn't recommend it enough - & I'm already looking forward to next year!",5,2007,11,12
217,Extremely Dissapointed,"I booked the Ritz Carlton for the last weekend in October as I wanted to go somewhere special to get engaged to my boyfriend.  The price tag of €300 per person for room only for 2 nights seemed extreme but we were willing to pay it for our special occasion.  When booking by the hotel website I stated the reason for our visit.  I was very disappointed that there was no mention of our engagement when we arrived as I know most hotels will leave chocolates or a bottle of wine or even a message of congratulations.

The check in desk was overwhelmed but the staff was pleasant.   I did notice alot of ""locals"" clogging up the reception area & I feel this will have to be dealt with to make their guests stay more comfortable.   It took quite a while for our bags to be brought to our room.  I was impressed by the decor of the hotel, especially the mini plasma in the bathroom.  Also we had a nice view of the Sugar Loaf Mountain.  The bed was one of the most comfortable I have ever slept in. 

Our lunch in the Gordon Ramsey restaurant was disappointing.  I had the set menu which was €30 for 2 courses.  My boyfriend had 2 courses from the a la carte costing €80 (even though the portions were the same size as the set menu) A mouthful of house wine cost €12.  I wouldn’t eat there ever again.  It's over hyped.  We were warned by a fellow guest to skip breakfast in the hotel as it was over €30 per head & was of a very poor standard, so we ate in a cafe in Enniskerry village.  The food in McGill’s pub was ok after I sent my beef burger which was dripping in blood back to be cooked properly.  Again €20 for a burger & chips is totally over the top, especially when I can’t say it was overly tasty.

Our room was not cleaned or the bed was not made on the 2nd day.  I had to request cleaning twice.  The pool was closed on the second day ""due to unforeseen circumstances"" and I found it very frustrating to be paying for 5* facilities which we could not use.  I wasn’t willing to pay the extortionate prices for the spa.  I don’t see the point in spending €125 for a facial or massage that you can get in any other 4/5* hotel for €80.  

On checkout our bill was not correct.  We had been charged for 5 dinners in McGill restaurant, even though there were only 2 of us.  I am so sorry now that I didn’t choose to stay somewhere else for my ""special weekend"" as I seemed to spend most of my weekend at reception or on the phone requesting things that should have been done automatically.   The only thing that made up for it was visiting Powerscourt House & Gardens & having a delicious lunch in Peggy Murphy’s pub, well worth a visit, just don’t bother wasting you money staying in the Ritz Carlton.",2,2007,11,12
217,Sublime Food! & Excellent Service,"I stayed in the Ritz Carlton on Saturday night and found it to be a fabulous treat. The hotel itself is opulent but cosy with a laid back high class level of service.  There were lots of young families there and gave the whole hotel a lovely atmosphere. Each member of staff from the doorman to the barman was friendly, attentive and chatty. We stayed in a suite which was poor luxury and the beds were like lying in clouds they were so soft. The bathroom was the very same as the Capella resort in Castlemartyr (fab!) except it had the added extra bonus of a mirror/tv - very swish! We were lucky enough to get a table in the Gordon Ramsay restaurant and we spent 3 delectable hours there. The food was quite simply out of this world. An explosion of flavours! The restauant staff were quite superb - nothing excaped them. My dinner companion dropped her knife in her sauce which was subtley replaced by the waiter as we continued our conversation. The breakfast too, was to die for with an extensive buffet on display. However... if you want to complete your stay... you must order the waffles... after all that, you will be happy to roll on home!",5,2007,11,12
217,Not up to Ritz Carlton standards,"My husband & I have stayed at numberous Ritz Carltons before, & although we believe the Powerscourt Ritz has a lot of potential, it doesn't measure up to Ritz Carlton quality & service... 

On a positive note, our hotel room was amazing with the most comfortable bed & beautiful bathroom... 

However, during our stay, we encountered many problems. The wiring in the room was a bit off, because after only using the iron for 5 minutes, the fuse went out & we had no power in any of the plugs. Subsequently, the lock to our room stopped working & we were unable to get into our room. The ""engineer"" was not available, so everytime we wanted to get back into our room, a hotel personnel had to come with us with the master key... Also, the tv in the bathroom would randomly turn on for no reason.

Then, we tried to get reservations to the Gordon Ramsey restaurant on 3 different nights, but they told us nothing was available & made no effort to try to accomodate us. The first night we asked for a dinner reservation, they said they were booked, but would call us & try to fit us in. However, we never got a call. 

Also, something was wrong with the pool, so it was closed during our entire stay (although they told us it would be open during our stay). And the fitness center was only open 7pm-10pm (odd...). 

And lastly, one night we tried to go to the bar around midnight, only to find it was closed. The man at the front desk said to go to McGills (the hotel pub), but it was closed as well... 

In addition to all our problems with our stay, we noticed the grounds weren't finished. There were still many construction workers and gardeners on site painting, sanding, planting, etc. 

We feel like the Powerscourt Ritz should have delayed the opening another few months to add the final finishings and address the final details of the hotel. We love Ritz Carltons, so it's hard for us to say we didn't enjoy our stay... but the Powerscourt Ritz just didn't feel like ""Ritz Carlton"" quality and service.",2,2007,11,07
217,Fabulous Wedding,"We have just come back from a wedding that was held at the Ritz Carlton, Powerscourt Hotel Enniskerry, Co Wicklow, Ireland ""IT WAS FABULOUS!""  The setting was great, the staff and their services were 2nd to none. I don't know if the wedding planner was from the hotel but she did a terrific job. Unfortunately the hotel was too expensive for our family of five to stay there for the weekend once everything else had been paid for , However my husband & I would stay there for a weekend (just the two of us) for a special occasion. If money is freely available then this a place that should be visited.10/10 given",5,2007,11,06
217,Never Ever Again,"This hotel should be renamed the Pitts-Carlton as it is one of the worst hotels I have ever stayed in.

The first impression on entering the hotel on Saturday afternoon was very poor. The amount of people that were standing arount the lobby with their suitcases was a sight to behold.

We waited in line for over an hour to check in to the hotel, children were running and shouting and generally annoying guests. While waiting I heard people complaining that they had been waiting for two-hours for their room.

Many of the light bulbs in the feature chandelier have blown and have not been replaced.

The room was a good size but we only had a view of the car park.

The TV in the bathroom randomly came on and went off without warning.

Breakfast in the restaurant on Sunday morning was a joke. In fairness we were seated immediately when we arrived at about 9am, however, the hot buffet breakfast left a lot to be desired. All the bacon was gone and had not been replenished, there was one small mushroom and three half tomatoes left. Eggs are served one way - scrambled. I did ask a member of the waiting staff if I could have poached eggs and I was told no, but I could have fried eggs if I wanted.

One of the unique selling points of this hotel is its location yet diners are not allowed to have their breakfast on the veranda.

On check-out we noticed our bill had additional charges for services we never used, ie dinner in Ramsey's Restaurant and breakfast (we were on an inclusive B+B rate)

Would I go back to this hotel again? NO ABSOLUTELY NOT. Would I recommend this hotel to a friend? NO ABSOLUTELY NOT. 

I am in the process of writting a letter of complaint to the General Manager and will be happy to share the outcome (if any) with this forum.",1,2007,10,30
217,Don't bother,"Horrible.  I booked here for a nice weekend for myself and my boyfriend.  Such a joke.   The first room we were given had no bath in the bathroom, only a shower, the room was unmade and bathroom was dirty.  Food in the bar area, (if you can get a seat) is not good.  I had to return two dishes.  Some of the staff looked as if they had never worked in a bar or hotel before.  No atmosphere.  No nice quite area to sit and read the newspaper.  It was so horrible I tried calling a few hotels on Saturday after we checked in, but every where was booked out.  Otherwise we would have left.
Don't waste your time or money.  There are so many fantastic hotels in Ireland this is not one of them.  I am very surprised this hotel is allowed to use the  ""Ritz-Carlton"" brand, it does not live up to the name. 
Needless to say I will not be returning!!",1,2007,10,30
217,Suitably dissapointed....,"Myself and my wife stayed in the hotel for one night on October 27th 2007.

Our first impressions were that the hotel is beautifully designed and finished to the highest of standards. Our check in was quick and painless and our room was amazing (we stayed in a garden view suite). However, the website did claim that the room would have views of the garden but infact because of the loaction of our room we did not have any view at all (which was very dissapointing!!).

The spa was first class and the pool was amazing. Definatly one of the high points of the hotel.

We decided to dine at the sugarloaf bar. The service was terrible. We sat at a table for 15 minutes before anybody came near us. When we gave our order they made a mess of it resulting in my food being left on the table and my wifes arriving 10 minutes after mine was finished. To add insult to injury, the over priced food was average to say the least. I noted that the couple sitting beside us seemed to have simmilar problems.

This hotel has potential, however the €405 B&B price tag for our stay did not offer value for money.

Generally dissapointed.",3,2007,10,30
217,the lights are on .......,"wanted a relaxing weekend away from dublin for my wife and myself.  We booked a suite well in advance on the club floor plus golf and  spa treatments.  Was informed a few days before we where to arrive that the club floor would not be active untill December and as asked if we still wanted the reservation. we confirmed the reservation as it was to late to organize an alternative destintion.
 This hotel has along way to go before it meets the standerds of a five star hotel. The staff and the hotel facilities  could not deal with the number of people in the hotel. Unless you ate in your room, you would have to wait in line for breakfast  and lunch. roomservice could take over an hour.
either the staff where not given the athority or did not hace the motivation to set things right if a costomer pointed out shortcommings to them. I wwould stay away from this hotel for at least six months and let someone else pay for the learning curve.",2,2007,10,29
217,An amazing place,"This was the best place we have ever stayed, on an absolute basis and on a value for money basis.  The staff were extremely welcoming, as I guess they should be, but they without exception all demonstrated a perfect understanding of how to make a guest feel very comfortable in his surroundings.

The room was huge! The bed was huge. The  walk-in wardrobe area in the room was huge. The bathroom was huge. The TV was huge.  The TV screen integrated in the bathroom mirror was a first in my experience of hotel rooms. The bathroom fittings were fit for royalty.

The common areas of the hotel were warm and comfortable.  The breakfast was a feast.  

This hotel should be a benchmark for all others in providing perfect hospitality.  We have stayed in many other hotels and none have been as impressive or as comfortable anywhere.  We have sometimes paid more but recieved a lot less in terms of service and good hospitality.",5,2007,10,22
217,Great location but poor value for money,"The location of the hotel is fantastic! The potential is there, but unfortunately the hotel now belongs to the Marriott group.
Our room (King Superior with balcony) was very nice and big. Unfortunately, neither the room service nor the cleaning in the breakfast area is very thorough. Everything is removed, but the fact that you have to complain should not be allowed in this price range.
The price-performance ratio is therefore not OK, even if there is nothing wrong with the room and the other facilities.",4,2023,08,16

217,Traumhotel in wundervoller Lage,"Mein zweiter Aufenthalt in diesem Traumhotel in den Wicklow Mountains. Vom Empfang bis zum Auschecken perfekte Urlaubstage. Die Zimmer sind riesig und komfortabel, Luxus pur, die Aussicht auf den „Sugarloaf“, ein Traum!!! Über Sauberkeit muss ich nichts schreiben, denn Sauberkeit und Service sind für das geschulte Personal eine Selbstverständlichkeit. Klappt mal was nicht, wird sich, in unserem Fall mit einer Flasche Prosecco, erkenntlich gezeigt. Das Frühstück ist ausgezeichnet und  auch der hauseigene Pub „Mc Gills“ lädt zum Verweilen ein, wenn auch dieses Mal leider ohne Life Musik. Das Hotel ist ein idealer Ausgangspunkt für Touren und Wanderungen in den Wicklow Mountains. Die wundervollen Powerscourt Gardens liegen gleich daneben. Was mir persönlich ganz besonders gefällt ist, dass es wohl ein Luxushotel ist, aber absolut ohne abgehoben und versnobt zu sein, der Wohlfühlfaktor ist wirklich sehr hoch. Das Personal ist zu jeder Zeit aufmerksam und sehr sehr nett! Liebes Powerscourt-Team, ich komme ganz sicher wieder!!!",5,2021,11,19
217,"High End, etwas ohne Charme. Preis-Leistung stimmt nicht.","Eine Nacht im Oktober 2021 unterhalb der Woche. Die sehr schöne Lobby war bei Ankunft von einer Horde Opel-Leuten belagert. Schade. Denn damit war das Ambiente weg. Die Zimmer selbst groß, aber ohne Charme. Man wacht auf und weiß erst durch den Blick aus dem Fenster, dass man sich in Irland und nicht in einer X-beliebigen amerikanischen Großstadt befindet.

Schwimmbad i.O.

Preis-Leistung nicht angemessen.",4,2021,10,22
217,Sensacional hotel en Irlanda ,"Hotel ubicado a 45-50’del aeropuerto de Dublin, en el condado / área de Wicklow. 

Es un hotel majestuoso en medio de la campiña irlandesa. Visto por fuera podría ser tranquilamente alguno de los que aparece en alguna de las películas de James Bond.

Las habitaciones son sencillamente impresionantes, con camas súper cómodas, baños inmensos (con calefacción por suelo radial) y todo tipo de facilidades. 

El Hall es súper bonito y muy acogedor, donde la madera predomina y en el que se puede uno sentar y descansar en alguno de los muchos sofás que hay. Merece la pena tomar una cerveza en su bar que tiene vistas a un jardín inmenso en la parte de atrás. 

Gimnasio fantástico, no le falta de nada. Amplio hasta decir basta. 

Salas para reuniones tiene un montón, desde alguna que puede ubicar a más de 200 pax a salas más funcionales para diferentes tamaños de grupos. 

Comida / desayuno muy bueno y variado (el Fish & Chips me resultó delicioso).

El único pero es la ubicación. Si se quiere hacer turismo algo alejado de Dublin. Aunque si se quiere tranquilidad & relax, y disfrutar del campo, sin duda una excelente opción.",5,2019,11,23
217,Insgesamt enttäuschend,"Spontan haben wir hier die letzten 2 Nächte unserer Irlandreise gebucht und hatten uns schon auf die AutographHotel-typische besondere Athmossphäre gefreut. Nix wars. Inzwischen hat die irische MHL-Kette das Hotel übernommen. Die Kette hat viele 4Sterne-Hotels und auf das Niveau scheint es jetzt hier hinauszulaufen, obwohl das Ambiente mit den Powerscourt-Gärten, dem wunderschönen Golfplatz und natürlich dem tollen epochalen Gebäude natürlich traumhaft ist. Das Personal ist aber zusammengewürfelt, höflich bemüht ohne übergrossen Ehrgeiz zu zeigen und auch am Können hat es hier und da gemangelt. Die Begrüssung an der Rezeption war auch nicht besonders überschwenglich.
Die Einrichtung eine Mischung aus altem RizCarlton-Stil mit Autograph-Möbeln und sonst noch einigem. Das ganze Flair eher lieblos und nichtssagend. Die Restaurant-Combi sehr speziell (ein feines Restaurant, ein Pub und die Hotellobby) und unglaublich kinderunfreundlich (wie auch die Spa-Zeiten). Kinder (und das sind alle unter 16) dürfen nur bis 20.00 Uhr ins Restaurant, danach gibt es mit Kindern nur Essen bis 21 Uhr in der Hotellounge oder bis 21.30 Uhr im McGills-Pub (😱). Eine richtige Hotelbar gibt es auch nicht und das Frühstücksbuffet war nicht mal eines 4-Sterne Restaurants würdig, abgesehen davon, dass wir 15min auf einen Tisch gewartet haben. Aber nicht, weil es so voll war, sondern weil der Service schlecht organisiert war, viele Tische blieben unabgeräumt leer.
Die Zimmer wenigstens sehr gross, modernes grosses Marmorbad mit Wanne und Dusche und begehbarer Kleiderschrank. Die Einrichtung sauber, aber lieblos.
Fazit: Aussen hui, innen sollte man den neuen Besitzern vielleicht erstmal mindestens ein Jahr Zeit geben, den Service hinzukriegen und die Dining-Struktur neuzugestalten. Wir haben uns hier unwohl und unwillkommen gefühlt. Das haben wir in einem echten 5-Sterne Haus so noch nicht erlebt. ",4,2019,08,10
217,Imposantes Gebäude,"Wir verbrachten zwei Nächte im Hotel in einem sehr großen Mountain View room im 6. Stock. Der Blick in die Landschaft war unglaublich schön, speziell vom Balkon aus. Das Zimmer und Badezimmer war mit allem Komfort ausgestattet; inkl. Kaffeemaschine. Das Hotel ist imposant aber nicht gemütlich, wie viele Grand Hotels dieser Größe. Aber die Lage im Estate ist phantastisch und für Golfer absolut geeignet. Der Afternoon Tee mit den Sandwiches und Scones sollte man keinesfalls verpassen.",4,2019,07,25
217,wunderschönes Hotel mit tollem Ambiente und schöne Lage,"wir haben mit Freunden auf unserer 10tätigen Irlandreise 2 Nächte in einer Junior-Suite in diesem stilvollen Hotel genossen. Traumhafte Lage, wunderschöne Riesen-Lobby.
Im Restaurant genossen wir eines der besten Frühstücksbuffets. Auch am Abend haben wir sehr gut dinniert. Der Service war überall sehr aufmerksam und äusserst freundlich.
Die Gartenanlage hat uns sehr beeindruckt.",5,2018,10,14
217,Einmalige Lage und Spitzenservice,Wir waren bereits zum 2. Mal Gast in dem Haus und dürften mit Glück (upgrade) eine Suite mit tollem Blick in den Garten für drei Nächte bewohnen. Wirklich herausragend ist der Service in allen Bereichen des Hotels!,5,2018,09,06
217,"Lontano da Dublino, ma bellissimo","L'Hotel si trova a Enniskerry, facilmente raggiungibile da Dublino con il taxi (ad un certo costo..) ed è bellissimo. E' immerso in un parco e le stanze sono veramente ampie, con bagni altrettanto ampi: i servizi sono al top e ci si trova di tutto. Si sta veramente bene.",5,2018,08,23
217,Tolle Lage und stilvolles Ambiente,"Wir hatten das Hotel für vier Tage Relaxurlaub gewählt, wofür es nur bedingt geeignet ist. Anders als auf dem Hauptfoto bei Tripadvisor, lassen sich die meisten Zimmerfenster nícht öffnen, man sitzt also drinnen bei AC. Es gibt auch im Aussenbereich des Hotels keine Möglichkeit, sich im Freien aufzuhalten. Zimmer sind toll, Schwimmbad groß und elegant, auch ohne Aussenbereich, viele BusinessVeranstaltungen, weshalb wir für die letzte Nacht in ein anderes Hotel umziehen mussten. Frühstück gut aber € 28,- p.P. netter Pub im Haus mit Lifemusic für den Ausklang des Abends bis 2 Uhr morgens geöffnet, gut! Sehr freundliches Personal",4,2018,06,06
217,Wunderschön & stilvoll ,"Sehr schönes Ambiente in der Lobby, sehr höfliches Personal. 
Wir haben allerdings relativ lange auf unser Zimmer warten müssen, weil es noch Reparaturen gab, die abgeschlossen werden mussten.
Das Zimmer war großzügig ebenso das Bad. Ich hab selten in einem Hotelbett so gut geschlafen. 
Frühstück sowie Teatime und das Essen in den Restaurants war köstlich. 
Nur im Spa haben wir spontan keinen Termin mehr bekommen. Hier sollte man am besten bei der Buchung gleich mit reservieren. 
Montags findet eine Feueralarmübung statt. Dazu ertönt ein lauter Ton. Davon waren wir etwas überrascht. 
Alles in allem hatten wir aber ein tollen Aufenthalt und konnten wunderbar entspannen. ",4,2018,03,06
217,Muy bueno,"El hotel está muy bien, las habitaciones son muy grandes y tiene todo lo que necesitas pare una estancia muy agradable.
El único problema es que está en medio de la nada y alejado de cualquier sitio, aunque el hotel incluso tiene un pub para tomarte algo.
La comida tipo buffet no es muy buena y con poca variedad, aunque supongo que hay otras opciones.",4,2017,07,06

Alles sehr edel eingerichtet, das Personal sehr freundlich, Spa, Fitnesscenter und Pool genial... also:
RUNDUM zu empfehlen!

Ach ja: In der Lounge im Eingangsbereich gibt es kleine Mahlzeiten, z.B. Falafel, zum akzeptablen Preis. Das sind eigentlich komplette reichhaltige Mahlzeiten, wenn Sie dann doch mal auf's Geld schauen wollen, ist das eine gute Option...",5,2016,09,28
217,Was ganz feines,Ein in die Landschaft modelliertes Hotel mit allem Komfort. Top eingerichtete Zimmer sauber und luxuriös. Alles sehr edel und gediegen. Dazu ein eigener Golfplatz toller SPA und traumhafte Parkanlage. Wer weg von Trubel Dublin sein will der ist hier richtig. Fahrzeit zur Stadtmitte 30 Minuten ,5,2016,09,23
217,Schönes Hotel in den Gärten Wicklows,"Wir haben unseren Aufenthalt über den Irland-Spezialisten rolf meier reisen ag aus Neuhausen am Rheinfall gebucht.

Das Hotel ist recht pompös gestaltet, mit viel Schnick-Schnack.
Die Zimmer sind grosszügig eingerichtet und lassen keine Wünsche offen, jedoch eher in einem älteren Stil - wem das gefällt, der fühlt sich hier sehr wohl.

Edel eingerichteter Spa-Bereich, der über tolle Behandlungsräume und über einen grossen Pool mit Sprudelbereich verfügt.

Grosszügiges Frühstücksbuffet mit Aussicht auf die riesige Gartenanlage.

Zum Abendessen sind wir mit dem Mietwagen nach Braye gefahren, wunderschöner Küstenort mit tollen Restaurants an der Strandpromenade.",4,2016,08,09

Sehr reichhaltiges Frühstücksbüffet. Auch hier extrem bemühtes und zuvorkommendes Personal. Selbst nach der offiziellen Schliessungszeit wurde man nicht wie in anderen Hotels üblich "" herausgeschmissen "" .
Wir hatten unvergessliche wunderschöne  4 Tage und werden gerne wieder kommen.",5,2016,06,17
217,PRECIOSO,Me encantó el sitio y la localización. El hotel es una pasada y las suites son espaciosas y elegantes. El desayuno es simplemente delicioso y los restaurantes del hotel también son excelentes. La localización es preciosa y la atención del hotel fue muy agradable.,5,2016,06,15
217,Ausgezeichnetes Hotel mit kleineren Fehlern,"Alles in allem ein sehr stilvolles Haus, jedoch je nach Zimmer (Etage!) und Tageszeit nicht immer zufriedenstellend. Foyer nachts ungenügend besetzt, viel Trouble beim Frühstück, schöne Bar mit (manchmal) Livemusik",4,2016,06,06
217,Excelente!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!,El hotel es increible.  Su gente tambien.  Increibles habitaciones. Los jardines son uno de los mejores del mundo (segun National Geographic) y segun mi opinion. Increible piscina en el spa. La comida excelente. El trato es unico. Ideal las habitaciones que dan al fondo del hotel por su imponente vista.,5,2016,05,26
217,M-E-R-A-V-I-G-L-I-O-S-O-!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!,"L'unica cosa che purtroppo non è andata bene è stato il tempo... Peccato che lo staff del Powerscourt non abbia questi poteri! Sarò breve: è un albergo semplicemente, come dico nel titolo, MERAVIGLIOSO. Una  di quelle strutture da sogno, dove una volta nella vita bisogna assolutamente andare. Ringrazio la mia azienda per avermi dato la possibilità di passarci ben 4 giorni. L'hotel sorge all'interno di un parco fantastico. Il mio consiglio è di andarci nei mesi più caldi, in modo da poter vivere a pieno tutto quell ben di Dio. Consigliatissimo!!!!",5,2016,02,24
217,Un hotel precioso para disfrutar,"Me encantó este hotel. Es perfecto para descansar y desconectar unos días. Ideal para ir con tu pareja y volver a conectar. 

El spa es precioso y los tratamientos perfectos. El desayuno está bien. Tiene grandes jardines para paseos. Muy interesante!",4,2015,12,14
217,Perfektes Tagungshotel,"Eine gute Ecke vom Flughafen entfernt, auf der anderen Seite der Stadt, aber direkt an den Wicklow Mountains landschaftlich wunderschön in einem Landschaftspark gelegen - das Powerscourt ist ein imposantes Hotel. Sehr große Zimmer, mit einem Ankleidezimmer  das von der Größe her in Paris als Zweibettzimmer durchgehen würde, Bad mit Dusche und Wanne, das einzige das fehlt ist ein Balkon (die Zimmer zum Berg hin haben null Aussicht) und eine vernünftige Auswahl an Fernsehprogrammen. An deutschen Programmen gibt es nur RTL. Tolles Frühstücksbüffet, sehr nettes und aufmerksames Personal im ganzen Hotel und viele Tagungsräume, vom Ballsaal bis zum schicken Boardroom. Ob tatsächlich 5+ Sterne sei dahingestellt, aber auf jeden Fall sehr gut.",4,2015,11,16
217,Fantástico!,"Me alojé a finales de octubre. Un hotel de ensueño, ubicación fantástica, trato excelente, las habitaciones son increíbles y todas con wifi. El baño tiene televisión!! Dentro del complejo donde se encuentra ubicado el hotel, hay unos jardines que merece la pena visitar (10€ la entrada). Estuve tres días por motivos laborales y repetiría sin dudarlo. ",5,2015,11,07
217,"gutes Hotel, aber schlechter als erwartet","Das pompöse Schloss, das wir aufgrund der Abbildungen im Internet erwartet hatten, entpuppte sich als verschachtelter 80er(?) Jahre-Bau, der wegen der Hanglage nur rückwertig ein repräsentatives Bild abgab. Innen war alles sehr gepflegt und hochwertig und stilvoll eingerichtet. 

In unserem Zimmer fehlte es allerdings an Licht, was zum einen an der nicht vorhandenen Deckenbeleuchtung, zum anderen an der Ausrichtung des Zimmers zum Innenhof bzw. den Bäumen vor dem Fenster lag. Als irritierend empfanden wir in diesem Zusammenhang auch die Steuerung der vorhandenen Lampen - teilweise über herkömmliche Schalter, teilweise über ein Touch-Display, das störanfällig und nicht intuitiv zu bedienen war ...

Auch die Bedienung des Fernsehers war komplex und der Empfang der wenigen nicht-irischen Sender extrem schlecht (RTL als einziges deutsches Programm).

Gut, Umgebung und Hotel haben auch sehr viel Besseres zur Freizeitgestaltung zu bieten: Powerscourt Estate mit Golfplatz, Schloss, Schlossgarten und Wasserfall (alles wunderschön!), Hotelschwimmbad (etwas heruntergekommen, und Zugang für Kinder leider sehr limitiert), Spielplatz und Spielzimmer (nett) ... mehrere Restaurants (gutes Essen, nur etwas überteuert und Personal teilweise unfreundlich).",4,2015,10,21
217,Muy lindo,"Un hermoso hotel con una ubicación estupenda. El servicio al cliente es de excelencia. Lo único que tienen que mejorar es las áreas de comida. El restaurante principal no abre hasta las 12:00, lo que lo veo mal para quien almuerza temprano, y cuando te atienden tardan demasiado en darte la comida. Estuve 1 hora esperando por un sandwich.

217,Kleines Paradies,"inmitten einer prächtigen hügeligen Landschaft liegt dieses wunderschöne Resorthotel flankiert einerseits von einem der schönsten Gärten Irlands und anderseits einem tollen 36-Loch Golfplatz. Die Hotelzimmer bzw. Suiten sind einmalig, geschmackvoll möbeliert und überall Flachbildschirme, selbst im grossen Marmorbad ist ein kleiner Bildschirm im Spiegel integriert. Das Frühstücksbuffet bietet alles, was man sich wünscht, ebenso am Abend lässt das 3-Gänge Menue die Herzen höher schlagen. Natürlich hat alles seinen Preis, aber es lohnt sich hier einmal zum Verwöhnen zu entspannen.

217,Puro lujo,Visite el hotel en mayo con mi esposo me encanto las areas cerdes el hotel es grande las habitaciones preciosas el baño es como para dormir en el. Lo mas que me gusto fue la piscina puro lujo y tranquilidsd. Si buscas un lugar relajado este es el hotel tiene una bellaza de paisajes los jardines de los mas impresionantes del mundo,5,2015,07,30
217,Alcune volte la 5 stella si paga,"E' davvero un hotel di lusso, perso tra la natura e il silenzio, un ottimo posto per rilassarsi.
Come ho detto nel titolo pero’ se si vuole godere di tutto il servizio relax bisogna pagare un tot. giornaliero, altrimenti ci si deve ""accontentare"" della magnifica piscina e dell’idromassaggio in un ambiente quasi magico.
Personalmente la seconda e ultima critica che mi posso permettere di fare è quello della varietà della colazione, questo non significa che la qualità sia scarsa, ma in altri hotel simili a questo, alcune volte ho visto più quantità e più qualità!
Per il resto una camera enorme con 2 letti king size, un bagno nel quale ci si può dormire, un anticamera dome riporre almeno una quindicina di valigie... insomma davvero una categoria superiore!
Caratteristico e non molto costoso invece il PUB al suo interno!
Connessione wireless gratis e performante.
MI stavo dimenticando nel bel mezzo del gigantesco specchio del bagno... spicca una quadro tutto nero, accendetelo e guardatevi la TV! wow",4,2015,04,13
217,"Aufpassen, dass der Glanz nicht verloren geht","Definitiv ein tolles Hotel. Jedoch beginnt es zu ""bröckeln"". In den Details muss unbedingt mehr Unterhaltsarbeit geleistet werden.

217,INCREIBLE!!!,"El hotel esta ubicado en las afueras de Dublin, solo a media hora. Un lugar con montañas, rios y una vegetacion increible. Las habitaciones son enormes y super lujosas. El personal es muy agradable y amable. Es para estar unos dias desconectado todo. Hay para hacer caminatas y tambien biciletas que te presta el hotel para recorrer.",5,2014,09,26

217,Un salto nel lusso e charme irlandese,"L'hotel è molto bello, con camere lussuose, grandi e complete di tutto. Il personale più che professionale e molto cortese. Il pub all'interno dell'hotel serve ottimi cibi a prezzi di poco più alti che in paese che nel complesso definirei modici. Birre buonissime. Più caro il bar con veduta, ma è talmente belo lo spettacolo che si gode da li che almeno un caffè vale la pena prenderlo. 
Il parco tutt'intorno ti fa evadere dal mondo, le bici disponibili al ricevimento gratuitamente consentono o una visita agile e piacevole. Mega scacchiera nel parco antistante. Da ritornarci",5,2014,09,02
217,Lusso immerso nel verde,"Ottimo hotel, localizzato all'interno di uno splendido parco, accanto alla dimora storica di Powerscourt con i suoi meravigliosi giardini.
Lusso ed eleganza nelle aree comuni, con meravigliose composizioni di fiori freschi.
Camere di altissimo livello, dotate di tutti i comfort possibili ed immaginabili (basti vedere la piccola televisione nascosta all'interno dello specchio del bagno).
Piacevole anche la piscina interna, anche se purtroppo non dotata di vista.",4,2014,06,28
217,Überfüllte Idylle,"Eine riesige Hotelanlage mit gigantischen Ausmaßen in einer landschaftlichen Idylle.
Irgendwie passt das nicht zusammen. Zuviele Menschen und hektisches Treiben im Hotel.
Dieses ist zugegeben mondän und edel, aber ein kleines edles Landhotel oder Castle wäre an dieser Stelle viel viel schöner. 
Die Umgebung ist absolut traumhaft und man kann zu Fuß toll wandern oder Ausflüge mit dem Auto machen.
Die Platzzuweisung im Restaurant erfolgt offensichtlich nach Bekanntheitsgrad. Fensterplätze mit schöner Aussicht sind daher bei einem Kurzbesuch wohl eher Glücksache.
Auf einen Kaffee kommen wir bestimmt wieder. Für einen Urlaubsaufenthalt ist es uns zu urban in dieser Umgebung.",4,2014,03,05
217,"Confort, lusso e relax","Lo scorso fine settimana ci siamo concessi una notte in questo hotel. Abbiamo aproffittato del pacchetto: notte-colazione-massaggio. Se si prenota un massaggio di ha anche accesso alla SPA al piano superiore, munita di sauna, bagno turco e giochi d'acqua. Purtroppo gli uomini e le donne sono separati, pero' la vista bosco e' cosi' rilassante che stare da soli e' forse meglio. Dopo tutti i trattamenti c'e'e anche una sala detta del silenzio per bere e mangiare degli snack dopo il circuito termale. Al piano inferiore c'e' la piscina e anche la' un piccolo circuito termale a cui non accesso perche' questa settimana era al buio per un black out. Per insufficienza di spazio invece della Mountain View Deluxe room, ci hanno dato con nostra grande gioia una suite! bellissima, 66mq, una stanza col soggiorno, una con la camera da letto, lo spogliatorio, il grande bagno di marmo...che dire. Per finire l'indomani mattina la colazione, dolce e salato.
grazie di tutto",5,2014,02,12
217,Bellissimo!!!!,"Sono stata in questo hotel per una convention di lavoro. L'hotel e' bellissimo e immerso in uno splendido parco.

La vera sorpresa e' stata la camera che in realta' era un appartamento con salotto, cucina, camera da letto,  locale guardaroba, due bagni e una splendida terrazza che si affacciava sul bellissimo parco. Il personale dell' albergo era semplicemente fantastico e anche il cubo per essere in Irlanda non era niente male. Insomna lo consiglio vivamente!!!

217,Ritz Carlton Gold Standards at its best,"Das ,,The Ritz Carlton Powerscourt"" befindet sich etwa 40 Fahrminuten von Dublin entfernt in den Wicklow Mountains und in unmittelbarer Nähe der gleichnamigen Powerscourt Gardens umgeben von grünen Wiesen und Wäldern.

Bereits bei der Fahrt zum Hotel in der hoteleigenen Limousine, die vom Concierge des Hauses gefahren wurde wurden wir über die möglichen Freizeitaktivitäten in der näheren Umgebung informiert. Am Hotel angekommen wartete man bereits auf unsere Ankunft und nahm uns sehr herzlich in Empfang. Anschließend wurden wir vom Concierge auf unser Zimmer in der sechsten Etage gebracht und über die Annehmlichkeiten des Hauses und unseres Zimmers informiert.
Sehr angenehm viel auf, dass man in diesem Haus versucht von Beginn an eine freundliche Beziehung zu seinen Gästen aufzubauen. So wurden wir von der Fahrt zum Hotel bis zum Betreten des Zimmers jeweils von demselben Mitarbeiter des Concierge Service begleitet.

Das Zimmer der Superior Kategorie ließ hinsichtlich Ausstattung und Zustand des Mobiliars keine Wünsche offen und verfügte, neben einem begehbaren Kleiderschrank, Sitzecke, sehr geräumigen Bad mit im Spiegel eingelassenen Fernsehgerät, unter anderem über einen großen Balkon mit Blick auf den Sugar Loaf Mountain.
Die Zimmerreinigung und der Turndown-Service erfolgten täglich zu unserer vollsten Zufriedenheit.

Das Frühstücksbuffet welches im Gordon Ramsay Restaurant serviert wird, bot eine ausreichende und qualitativ hochwertige Auswahl an kalten sowie, auf Bestellung zubereiteten, warmen Speisen wie Omelette und Eggs Benedict. Der Service im Restaurant war stets zuvorkommend und freundlich.

Auch abends bietet das Gordon Ramsay Restaurant ein hervorragendes Angebot an, mit lokalen Produkten zubereiteten, Gerichten sowie eine vorzügliche Weinauswahl und das alles zu, für ein Haus dieser Kategorie, sehr moderaten Preisen.
Ebenfalls sehr zu empfehlen ist der Besuch der Sugar Loaf Lounge zum Afternoon Tea. Die Auswahl an teils sehr raffiniert zubereiteten Sandwiches und Süßspeisen ist eine wahre Gaumenfreude.

Der Spa-Bereich des Hauses befindet sich im untersten Stockwerk und verfügt neben einem Dampfbad über einen 20 Meter langen Swarowski Pool sowie einem Jacuzzi. Leider bot dieser öffentliche Bereich des Spa, auf Grund der nicht vorhandenen Fenster, nicht den schönen Blick auf den Garten, wie dies im Fitness Center des Hotels der Fall ist.

Alles in Allem überzeugt das ,,The Ritz Carlton Powerscourt"" mit einem auf allen Ebenen sehr exzellenten Service und insbesondere der General Manager des Hauses Mr Damien O'Riordan ist sehr bemüht mit seinen Ladies und Gentlemen seinen Gästen einen persönlichen Service in einer sehr natürlichen und angenehmen Art und Weise zu bieten. 
Die einst von  Horst Schulze definierten Gold Standards werden in diesem Haus in vollem Umfang erfüllt.

Schließlich kann das ,,The Ritz Carlton Powerscourt"" uneingeschränkt all jenen empfohlen werden die ein Luxushotel in landschaftlich herrlicher Umgebung, sei es zum Entspannen oder um sich in der hügeligen Umgebung der Wicklow Mountains sportlich zu betätigen, und dabei nicht auf den persönlichen Service eines Ritz Carlton Hotels verzichten wollen.",5,2013,06,01
217,Non e' possibile acquistare il bel tempo,"Ho passato tre giorni in questo hotel in Aprile.  Ottimo albergo, grandi camere, ampia hall, ottima colazione con terrazza che da sul paco.  Nulla di che ridire sul servizio e hotel ma il tempo e' stato inclemente. Ogni giorno ha piovuto e un forte vento ha peggiorato la cosa. Non posso ovviamente lamentarmi dell' Hotel che ripeto e' ottimo ma e' difficile godere posti come questo se il tempo non e' favorevole",4,2013,04,26
217,Una estancia perfecta,"Un hotel ideal para ir a disfrutar de unas de las zonas mas bonitas de Irlanda.

Las habitaciones son amplias y confortables, con unas vistas inigualables del Sugar Loaf.

El staff del hotel es muy servicial, a destacar sus restaurantes y en especial en el Pub y los desayunos.

La zona de aguas merece una visita, por lo que  no hay que olvidar el bañador.

Sin duda un lugar donde volver.",5,2011,10,22

Das habe ich sonst bisher nicht erlebt. Super nettes und freundliches Personal. Sind jederzeit bemüht einen Top Service zu bieten. Schöne Zimmer. Sehr sauber. Wenn man allerdings auf der 6. Etage übernachtet und sein Zimmer zum Haupteingang hat dann stört die Balkonbeleuchtung erheblich da diese die ganze Nacht an ist.
Essen war jedoch leider für ein solches Hotel eher Durchschnitt. Meetingräume ohne Fenster ist auch nicht schön.",5,2011,10,16
217,Super Aufenthalt in Powerscourt,"Wir haben ein sehr schönes verlängertes Wochenende in Powerscourt verbracht. Angenehme gute Spaziergänge in den Gartenanlagen von Powerscourt. Einen weiteren Tag haben wir mit dem Fahrad am Riverwalk verbracht und am Flußrand fanden wir  eine sehr schöne exotische Botanik vor. Als weiteres Highlight ist  eine Bustour durch das umliegende Bergland zu empfehlen. Diese Bustour ist als Tagestour einzuplanen !
Für eine gute Kulinarik wird in den Hotelrestaurants gesorgt. Anschließend konnten wir den Abend mit Livemusik im  originellen hoteleigenen Irishpub ausklingen lassen  .",5,2011,08,02

Unsere Zimmer waren traumhaft, regelrechte Suiten mit Eingang und Gaestebad, Wohnzimmer, Schlafzimmer, Ankleidezimmer und grossen Bad mit riesiger Dusche und Badewanne und Terrasse. 
Am nachmittag hatten wir Afternoon Tea in der Sugar Loaf Lounge und auch der war hervorragend (besser sogar z.B. im Ritz in London oder in Ashford Castle, Cong). Spaeter waren wir im Wellnessbereich mit einem wirklich schoenen Pool in entspannendem Ambiente. 
Das Fruehstueck war ebenfalls hervorragend und sehr umfangreich.

217,Ruhige Lage,"Durch die Nähe zu den schönen Gärten des Powerscourt Estate (http://www.powerscourt.ie/) bietet sich ein Wochenendaufenthalt an. Die Umgebung und das Hotel sind sehr ruhig. Das Zimmer war sehr sauber und geräumig, die Bettwäsche von ausserordentlich guter Qualität. Das Personal war sehr freundlich und zuvorkommend.

Etwas übertrieben waren die Preise für Getränke und Essen, auch für ein Hotel dieser Klasse. Ein Tee um die 5 €. Ein herkömmlicher irischer Burger ist nicht für unter 20 € zu haben.",5,2011,01,25
217,Di gran classe circondato da un parco naturale che toglie il fiato,"Ho passato una sola notte in questo favoloso albergo e ho un ricordo indimenticabile.Il Ritz Carlton si trova a 20 km da Dubino nelle bellissima regione di County Wicklow in un parco meraviglioso. Boschi, favolosi prati, laghetti, campo da golf, una villa storica circondata da curatissimi giardini tutto a  pochi minuti a piedi dal hotel. Il Ritz Carlton rasenta la perfezione, lo stile è super lussuoso, molto caldo ed accogliente. Un' enorme vetrata che da su una vallata verdissima ti permette di immergerti nella bellezza della campagna irlandese mentre gusti una squisita colazione o un thè all'inglese con pasticcini e piccoli panini con salmone e caviale seduti comodamente in grandi divani di pelle. Le camere sono bellissime, spaziose con letti enormi, soffici. Il bagno è curato nei minimi dettagli, dalla vasca puoi comodamente guardare la tv  che appare con un meccanismo nello specchio del bagno. La spa è bellissima con una piscina che ha sul fondo tanti piccoli cristalli svaroski per un effetto magico. L'hotel ha un pub molto carino in stile tradizionale. Non abbiamo cenato nell'albergo ma abbiamo preso un taxi e siamo andati a mangiare in uno dei pub più famosi e antichi d'Irlanda, il Johnnie Fox's, tanto buon cibo, musica irlandese e danze tradizionali (attenzione per lo spettacolo con cena bisogna prenotare ben in anticipo). Se volete fare delle escursioni il personale gentilissimo vi metterà in mano una cartina stadale con segnata le strade più panoramiche e i posti più interssanti da visitare. In conclusione consiglio vivamente questo albergo che è caro ma ne vale la pena!",5,2009,04,23
