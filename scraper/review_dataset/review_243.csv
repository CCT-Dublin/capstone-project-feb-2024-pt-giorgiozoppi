243,Night away,The hotel is beautiful. Very modern looking with really cool decor. The rooms are cosy and the beds are unreal comfortable. The bed was huge! Lovely spot. Coffee here was a 10/ 10! It's very central only a few minutes stroll into St Stephen's Green. The staff were super friendly and a shout out to Lisa on reception who was especially kind and helpful. We would love to come back. Highly recommend to anyone staying in Dublin for a break.,5,2024,10,19
243,Family Research 2024,"Friendly staff & great place to visit. The room was clean & quiet. The food was really tasty. The hotel is in an excellent location to visit the sights. I really felt valued and made to feel welcome, and an issue with  checking in  I had was swiftly rectified",5,2024,10,18
243,Would stay again.,"Overall stay was pleasant. Hotel has a fun vibe with a restaurant and bar and the deluxe double room was what we expected. My only complaint is bedding was hot. Most of the rooms we stayed in on our trip did not have AC so it was a nice feature. But even with the room cool, the bedding was overly warm with no alternative such as a light blanket or even a sheet between the bedspread and fitted sheets. I would stay again, very centrally located.",4,2024,10,17
243,Handy Central Hotel,"Great location, clean modern room. Perfect for solo, short stay. Friendly staff and easy check-in/out. Only negative was TV only had Rakuten TV Channels. I had to cast from my phone to TV. Close to Stephen's Green, Gaiety Theatre, National Concert Hall etc.",4,2024,10,17
243,3 great days around the Dublin area.,"I had 2 nights and 3 days in Dublin at the start of the week  with the intention of touring the city to see how it had changed.
I arrived early morning and there was no problem storing my case until check-in. The tall, young man and young lady who were working were a credit to The Marlin and couldn't have been more welcoming.
When I returned, check-in was quick and easy and the room was warm and comfy with a really good shower. I'd read that the Cosy King rooms didn't have a kettle and courtesy tray but mine did. Very welcome. 
If you're staying more than a few days, take some extra hangers as you only get 3 fixed to a rail.
I didn't eat in the hotel and guess I wasn't a typical guest as I was up and off. I did use the 'Horsebox' for a quality coffee and pastries before I set off for the day.
There was building work going on in the yard outside my room and work starts just after 07:30.  It didn't bother me as I was already up but ask about it if you're hoping for a lie in.
The location is very central and I would recommend that other travellers pre-buy a visitors Leap card. I had mine delivered to my home address and it starts the 1st time you tap into the system. You can use it on the tram, DART railway, Dublin bus and trains within the County area. Depending on where I was heading I either walked round to St. Stephen's Green for the tram or walked to Aungier St. for the bus.

IMHO Temple Bar is over priced, over hyped and not real Dublin. Aungier St and the Camden St. area is a much better bet. I was out after midnight Sunday and Monday and felt safe walking back to the hotel.",5,2024,10,16
243,2 night solo travel,"Great value for the price- location was walkable, and everything was new and clean. I stayed in the cosy king, and while small, the space is well-utilized, and it was perfect for 1 or 2 people. The bed and linens are comfortable. Would definitely stay again.",5,2024,10,16
243,Recommended!!,"Friendly and helpful staff, great location at St Stephen's Green, and nearby public transportation.

243,Great location and very comfortable,"This hotel has a great location, walking distance to everything on your first visit to Dublin. It is about 800 m from the bus stop on Wellington Quay, where Dublin Express bus would drop you off from the airport. Check-in is at 3:00 pm - there’s a fee if you want to check-in earlier. But they have a storage room where they put your suitcases, so you can enjoy your first day in Dublin. The staff at the reception is welcoming and friendly. Our room was Deluxe 1 King Bed, and very comfortable. There is a lot of storage space, nice lightning, a safe, a fridge, a coffee maker, iron and ironing board, complimentary bottles of water. The bathroom is spacious, there is a walk-in shower and toiletries. The hotel is quiet, no outside noises at all, perfect for a good night sleep.

We picked up our rental car the day we were checking out and the Enterprise/Alamo pickup was just across the street. I would definitely recommend The Marlin Hotel to anyone traveling to Dublin.",5,2024,10,10
243,I had an amazing stay here!,"I had a really nice stay at the Marlin Hotel in Dublin.  I was in a ""Cozy King"" room which had a very nice and comfortable layout.

Staff are all on point and can help with anything, place is spotless and easy to navigate. The location couldn't be better in my eyes, less than 5mins and you're in the middle of shopping, bars and restaurants but not disturbed when you retire.

243,Business trip ,"Excellent hotel.

Rooms are small on first sight, but actually has more than enough space, with an emperor size bed that acts as a sofa. Despite this, it was very comfortable.

243,Great stay at the Marlin Hotel,"The Marlin Hotel was a great spot to base ourselves in Dublin. It was very conveniently located next to the Stephen's Green shopping center which had a lot of restaurants and shopping options. It was also very close to St. Stephen's Green, which was a very nice park to walk through. The room was very nice, and the hotel restaurant served great food. We would definitely stay here again.",5,2024,09,25

And a decent gym which is available 24 hours.  Second visit here and consistently good again.  Would recommend this hotel.,5,2024,09,24
243,Enjoyed this hotel.,Not an extravagant hotel - just a really nice one.  Everything was walkable.  Short walk to Trinity College and the Liffey (about 10 minutes).  My favorite thing about this hotel was its proximity to the Hairy Lemon - about two blocks toward the Liffey.  The Hairy Lemon is a more traditional Irish Pub with great food.,5,2024,09,23

243,Can't beat the location - great value for a center-city hotel,"Stayed in the Marlin early September, 2024.  The hotel is located just a block off Grafton St. and only a few blocks from Temple Bar (the entertainment district).  Everything in Central Dublin is walkable from here.  Don't expect large rooms.  To keep things affordable, most rooms are designated as ""Cozy"".  Think of cruise ship cabins and you won't be far off.  But they are modern, clean and very well designed.  Like a cruise ship, you aren't going to be spending a lot of time in your room.  Breakfast is excellent and the beds are super-comfortable.",5,2024,09,22
243,Great location.,"Cosy comfortable room, extremely comfortable bed. Great location,  clean hotel and helpful staff. Used for a one night stay and was perfect for where I was going. I would definitely use this hotel again and look forward to a return visit soon",4,2024,09,21

Coffee booth in reception was convenient and wide variety. 
Do it yourself checkin was different but easy",5,2024,09,20
243,Unforgettable Stay with Top-Tier Vibes at The Marlin Hotel,"My stay at The Marlin Hotel in Ireland was nothing short of incredible. The hotel itself is sleek, modern, and perfectly located, but what really set this experience apart was the service. Ralts, the vibes concierge, went above and beyond to make sure every detail of my stay was on point. From personalized recommendations to thoughtful touches, Ralts truly brought the best vibes and made me feel at home. If you’re looking for a spot that’s more than just a place to stay, this is it. For more details about my trip and other hidden gems I found, follow me on Instagram @tasteandvibesgo.",5,2024,09,19
243,First Visit to Ireland,"Great location, very friendly employees but their rooms run very hot. They have their AC units on a schedule and they go off al the time. We had to wake up 3-4 times each night to get up and turn the AC back on because the room go very warm and stuffy.",4,2024,09,19
243,Best experience ever,I cannot praise this hotel highly enough. It was the most pleasant experience of a hotel stay we have had in a long time. Very friendly staff yet not intrusive. The decor is so relaxing and the room spotless and very comfortable. Close to everything in Dublin. Loved it and we will be making this our go to hotel when in Dublin. ,5,2024,09,19
243,Great stay!,Our stay was lovely. Our room wasn’t ready yet in the morning but we were able to freshen up and store our bags. We explored the area and were able to check in and our room was nice and spacious. The hair dryer was probably the best hotel dryer I have ever used. The staff was friendly and the bar was great. The hotel was in a great location and we could walk to just about everything. There were taxis right outside the door as well. We would definitely stay here again.,5,2024,09,19
243,Great beds,Bed is huge at the cost of a smaller room but worth it. Very comfortable mattress. Only criticism I have is that cleaning staff start quite early in the hotel so don't be too surprised if you hear some banging and noise from 8am. Normally not an issue but could be if you're recovering from the night before. Didn't eat or drink there but the place is spotless.,4,2024,09,18
243,Always a great stay,Always a fantastic stay at the Marlin! The staff are very friendly and eager to help make your stay top tier. Rooms are comfy and clean. The location is fantastic also. Located on a quiet side street but just steps to Grafton and other popular streets. The breakfast is great. Variety of food selection to suit any diet.,5,2024,09,18
243,"Safe, Comfortable, Solo Stay","This was my first solo stay. My flight arrived early in the morning and I made my way to the Marlin. While I could not check-in yet, they did allow me to store my luggage. My room was a cosy king with a wall to wall bed. Awesome! Alone I had plenty of room, but if there were two of us, there would not have been enough storage space for clothes and suitcases. However, we could make do as the room was clean, comfortable, quiet, and would hopefully not a lot of time would be spent there beyond sleeping. I did visit the bar and found it to be quiet and professional. I did love the eclectic decor. Customer service as soon as you walked into the lobby was A+!",4,2024,09,18
243,"Used to be good, now pretty terrible.","Used to be good, now quite hopeless. I’ve stayed here probably seven times now, only in the larger rooms. The small but well designed rooms are kind of like a Japanese capsule hotel. All the rooms are quite compact, the windows don’t open so you NEED air conditioning. One two stays now, the air conditioning has malfunctioned, this last time it shut itself off every 90 minutes throughout the night, so I’d wake up because it was so stuffy, and have to go and turn it back on. 

The automated check in system used to work really well and was so efficient, zero lines. This time, it’s been changed. It didn’t issue me a room number, which was apparently supposed to be sent by SMS. As a result, we had to queue for 20 mins plus to get a room number from the astonishingly indifferent receptionist, who took the time to tell me how ‘state of art’ the new check in system is, but not to actually apologize. 

There are various level of room available on the booking site. The basic ‘cozy’ room, superior room, executive room, accessible room and a suite. I booked the executive room. We were assigned an accessible room, which was significantly cheaper on the website. So I returned to reception to ask for the correct room. After another wait, we were assigned a superior room, again, cheaper than the executive room. At this point, we just took it, as we had dinner reservations we had to get to. This is bait and switch is really unacceptable and actually deceitful. The confirmation email clearly states ‘executive room’ , and TWICE, that isn’t what we were allocated. 

This isn’t a spa hotel where you go to celebrate with a wonderful hospitality experience. It’s  supposed to be a functional urban hotel within easy reach of necessary infrastructure where you can reliably get a good nights sleep and go about your day. Now it doesn’t even deliver that. So disappointing. 

On a few occasions while checking out, I’ve heard a receptionist offer their email to a guest so they can contact them directly next time they stay. It even shows up here in the responses. Hotels know that very few people ever bother to do that, but it gets them off the hook of addressing a problem immediately with a refund or compensation of some sort.

243,Wish I was staying for more than one night,Absolutely beautiful hotel. The reception area is fantastic and loved the self check in. The bed was super comfortable. All the staff I encountered were so friendly. My favourite part though was definetly the horsebox coffee shop and the coffee was gorgeous. Will 100% return to this hotel.,5,2024,09,14

243,Great hotel,The Hotel is great. Clean and great location for catching the bus to major attractions. The only obstacle is parking.

243,Fantastic stay with excellent service and comfort,"The stay was great. The staff were friendly and extremely helpful. I stayed in the Cozy King Room, which was excellently designed.

The hotel's location was convenient, and breakfast was delicious with plenty of options.
 Highly recommended!",5,2024,09,13
243,"Nice location, nice staff","I highly recommend this hotel. Nice location because its a walking distance to restaurants and transportation, friendly staff, super clean rooms. The space of the room is not very big but its enough. They also have a restaurant which has good food and gluten free options. We saw sketchy people sniffing “something” right outside the hotel. I still gave it 5 stars because I do not think its the hotel’s fault. After seeing the incident though, we become more vigilant as we go to the hotel. We try not to stay after 8pm. Hotel is nice but we feel unsafe so might not be back. Too bad we really like the hotel itself",5,2024,09,13
243,Great bed and location,This was the best bed we had on the trip.  Cozy king was very comfortable as were the pillows.  Breakfast staff were very nice and the food was very good.  The location was perfect and you can walk to everything.  We would definitely stay here again.,5,2024,09,12

243,Great but noisy,"Phenomenal staff and hotel! Really really friendly and helpful! Decent gym and good breakfast.

But the room doors. Man oh man. I don’t think they could make them any less noise proof. If someone farts in the hallway, you will hear it through your room door. Not always nice when you are trying to sleep.

If they upgrade this, I will stay again.",4,2024,09,06

243,25th Wedding Anniversary stay at the Marlin Hotel,"I spent my 25th Wedding anniversary at this Hotel.

Initially we had an issue which was resolved the next day by management team.

The Hotel is situated in the center of Dublin on a quiet street about 10 minutes walk from the bar and restaurant area.

The hotel could be described as a modern, designer hotel with good facilities in general. 

The breakfast was excellent with a large selection of food, the staff were very friendly and professional. 

 The Suite that we had was large and spacious.  I have stayed at the hotel twice before where I would normally go for the executive room. 

My recommendation is to go for an executive  room as the cosy rooms are really too small. 

A big shout-out to the management team for making our 25th Anniversary special. We really appreciated the effort.",5,2024,09,06
243,Would go again,The food was lovely and so were the rooms. Good breakfast and very central. Ice machine on every floor. Chic hotel and very helpful staff. Had a slight issue and the staff were more than helpful and resolved the issue quickly.  I Would go back again and recommend to others.,5,2024,09,05
243,Mid week stay,Really friendly staff and they even checked me in earlier without fuss. Room and food was really good and the bar had a nice friendly vibe ,5,2024,09,05
243,Great Hotel,"The room was great, the facilities within the room were tremendous, however the main star of your hotel is Ralph he is truly outstanding and really has the customer at the heart of everything he does,  
Ralph asked if I had stayed before and I said yes and that I actually didn't enjoy my last stay , however he  made it his mission to turn my opinion around and that he did",5,2024,09,05
243,Great place to stay!,"Lovely hotel with everything needed! Very nice,  helpful, and friendly staff. Great location and very vibrant surroundings. There are a lot of pubs and restaurants next to the hotel. Other places like Trinity College Dublin and St. Stephens Green are just few minutes away. I enjoyed my stay and highly recommend it to anyone planning to explore Dublin!",5,2024,09,04
243,"Lovely Hotel,Great Location!","Stayed for the Coldplay concert Sunday night.
Upon arrival a very friendly staff member helped us with the self check in service.
The hotel is lovely,bar though had zero atmosphere,this was about 2pm.Nice atmosphere about the reception area.
Our room had all you could want,different room layout to the norm but the bed was super comfortable!
Great location too!
Thank You!",4,2024,09,03
243,"Good location, clean and convenient hotel,  yummy breakfast buffet.","Overall a nice stay in a terrific location to access the sites of Dublin. We walked easily to many historical sites and shopping. No need for a taxi and would actually recommended against it as it appeared to be slower.  Room was very clean, comfy bed.  Enjoyed the breakfast buffet.",5,2024,09,03
243,Lovely central hotel,"The Marlin is a lovely hotel, we checked in via a computer in the lobby which was quick and handy.
The room was compact but all the we needed, as we were staying for a concert. The location was great and very central. 

The q park car park was literally facing the front doors so parking was easy and validated at reception on check out for €30 per 24 hours.

We did have issue along with multiple other people, on returning to the hotel after the concert. The lifts wouldn't accept anyone's key cards and we had to look for staff to get it working.

Overall, we found the Marlin to be a lovely hotel to stay in. 
We would definitely stay again.",4,2024,09,03
243,Marlin Hotel - 5 star from me,"Excellent location, helpful and friendly staff. It has everything you need for a great stay in Dublin.",5,2024,09,03
243,Great place!,"Nice accommodations. The room, lobby, bar are wonderfully maintained. Food at the bar and lobby coffee were delicious. The location is walking distance to everything but tucked away on a quiet street. The service was great and everyone I encountered was extremely pleasant",5,2024,09,02
243,Great Value City Centre,"A very comfortable hotel , centrally situated, with very attentive staff and reasonably priced. Ideal for first time visitors to Dublin, but all will find it a pleasant central hotel. ",5,2024,09,02
243,10/10 hotel experience,"The hotel is perfect for a city stay. I came for one night for a concert (only 40 minutes walk from royal hospital kilmainham). 
But id definitely come again for a weekend break. The room was lovely and spacious. The bed was very comfy. Hygiene was great. The staff were friendly on check in and check out. 
The location of the hotel is also perfect, and not for a crazy price too. 10/10.",5,2024,09,02
243,"Definitely are go to hotel next time we travel to Dublin. From check in to check out , it was perfect.","Rooms are small but was not an issue as I knew this before are stay.  Very clean and comfortable.We stayed just the one night and this hotel was perfect. Check in was a breeze and with parking just across the street, you couldn't ask for better. Reception area and bar/ restaurant is really nice and had a very relaxing, chilled vibe. Staff couldn't do enough for the guests. Nothing was to much trouble. Breakfast was great with a good variety to choose from and I will definitely stay again.",5,2024,09,02
243,King Size room small but perfect,"Booked this for a colleagues leaving get-together and combined anniversary going out and it was perfect. The room we booked we knew was their small ones but damn was it functional and comfortable. The style in room and overall hotel is on point, staff were helpful and lovely and the whole experience was great. They really are trying very hard to be great and they nail it. Location is more than ideal.

If you want a bigger room they have them but honestly the smaller king bed rooms really were perfect.

Happily stay here again and will look first here when visiting Dublin in future before anywhere else.",5,2024,09,01
243,Excellent- Strongly Recommend,"Lovely, clean and modern rooms and public spaces. Great location within walking distance to pubs, shops, restaurants and historic sights. Staff was friendly and helpful. 24 hour laundry is a great ammenity for travelers packing light.  Would definitely stay again.",5,2024,09,01
243,Great location,"Perfect location 
Spotlessly clean 
comfortable room 
lovely staff 

Stayed for a concert and the hotel was perfect, really clean too. We upgraded our room. Staff were nice too. Breakfast was ok too. Early check in is available which is handy and late check out",5,2024,08,31
243,We had a lovely stay,"We really enjoyed our stay at the Marlin. The room, while small,  was perfectly comfortable and spotless. The staff were very friendly and helpful. We would definitely stay here again as the hotel was central, close to plenty of shops and places to eat and also the beautiful St Stephen’s Green. .",5,2024,08,31
243,Great hotel!,Beautiful hotel with a very impressive lounge and bar areas. We really liked the little coffee shop inside the hotel. Our room was very clean ans bright. Bed was very comfy and huge! It had everything we needed for our stay in Dublin. All the staff was also very friendly and very helpful. Location is also great- quite central and very close to Grafton Street and a walking distsnce (20min) to Temple Bar and other attractions. There is a lovely park near by and many cute coffee places and pubs. We would definitely stay here again!,5,2024,08,31
243,Outstanding,"Victoria was very caring when I asked about checking in a bit earlier. She had great friendly and caring personality. During my stay she would genuinely caring. The location was very close to activities. I enjoyed taking advantage of shopping, site seeing and dinning.",5,2024,08,31
243,Good option for a stay in Dublin city centre.,"Great looking hotel, good central location. Room was a bit odd! but in a good way. Bed was against the window and took up the majority of the room (there was no bed side tables), bathroom was small, but shower was good.
Coffee trailer in the lobby had good coffee, bar/restaurant has a fairly decent menu and the food was tasty.
Check in is through the self use kiosk (like a supermarket self serve) so is a bit impersonal.",4,2024,08,30
243,Centrally located hotel,"The bed is so comfortable and the bathroom is great. Its kept super clean too. It is a centrally located hotel near everything.  They have a bar and a coffee place in the lobby. And make fresh cupcakes they give out every afternoon. 
The only drawback is the rooms are tiny, basically wall to wall bed and a desk. The bathroom is normally sized. It was all you need if not staying in your hotel much.",5,2024,08,30
243,Convenient stay in good location,"I stayed in the Cosy King which is small but perfectly fine for a solo traveler. The bed was HUGE and I enjoyed the ship-like feel of the space. One design flaw is there's only one outlet in the room and it's not close to the bed. It would also be useful if the safe was larger, as it couldn't fit a laptop in it. The view was just of another building which wasn't attractive and I felt very visible so I kept the shades lowered the entire time. The lobby is quite large and has a convenient snack/coffee cart. Check in was unnecessarily confusing - the screens both didn't work and then asked me to manually type it quite a lot of info. After running into an issue I just went to the desk and they checked me in in 30 seconds with no info needed. Great location, and overall good stay since I knew what to expect with the smaller room.",4,2024,08,29
243,"Great location, staff and value for money. We will absolutely stay here again!","The Marlin exceeded my expectations. The pictures really don’t do it justice at all. The king cosy beds are so spacious and comfortable. The hotel reception area is gorgeous, there’s such attention to detail shown and the decor was very impressive. The L’Occitane toiletries in the bathrooms were a nice touch! All of the staff we met were just fantastic, especially Jason who we met during check out. He really couldn’t have done more for us. The location was ideal also, right near a Luas stop and just by Stephens green and Grafton street. We would 100% stay here again!",5,2024,08,29
243,Innovation and Service,"The new system implemented in the reception department, where the client must carry out his own check-in, brings a touch of innovation; however, I did not like it because it reduces human contact, which is for me the essence of Hospitality.

Regarding your Restaurant, I congratulate you on the high level of customer service. The lady who served me, really exceeded my expectations with her attention to details and her high level of helpfulness. Thank you!",4,2024,08,28
243,YELLOW JACKETS BEAT FSU,"We arrived at the Marlin and were able to check in early by paying $20. This made my wife very happy!
They have a great conference room as well as a good restaurant and bar. ",5,2024,08,27
243,Good location;Cool tech but no reading lights or “business center”,"Close by but not buried in old town. Good assistance with otherwise self serve check in. Small but comfortable rooms. Lighting arrangements flexible  and easy to control from bed but no reading lights. Also strange no provision if you want to print out an email, etc. Also odd that one couldn’t charge drinks , food from bar to room. ",4,2024,08,27
243,Marlin hotel,"Staff was excellent, super friendly. Hotel was cute and modern. Rooms were small but efficient. Great location. Only complaint was old mattress that needs to be upgraded ",4,2024,08,27
243,Ireland 2024,"The hotel is centrally located, walking distance from everything.  The room was very nice, a little different.  The bed was called a cozy king, very comfortable along with the pillows.  You did have to scoot out of it, but that worked. The shower was very nice, good pressure.  The staff was very helpful all the time. Would definitely stay here again.",5,2024,08,24
243,"Lovely hotel, great staff, but a few drawbacks","Overall my spouse and I enjoyed our weeklong stay at Marlin. It was spotless throughout and well-appointed, but there were some drawbacks....

First, there was inadequate space for hanging clothes (only 3 hangers), and no place to hang bath/hand towels. Second, the laundry facilities were inadequate. Two of 6 machines were inoperable/ineffective for the week we were there. 

By far, the best part of our stay was the staff -- notably Virginia and Humberto in the dining room. Both were attentive, friendly, and helpful in many ways. We always looked forward to seeing them when we stayed for evening meals.",4,2024,08,24
243,Perfect location and comodity,"A fabulous experience: Centrally located, new and modern hotel, very friendly staff and excellent breakfast! Highly recommended! Thank you la",5,2024,08,22
243,"New, clean hotel with excellent breakfast buffet",The hotel appeared very new and clean. The breakfast buffet was the best we've had during our trip to Ireland. Customer service was also great and we were able to get our parking validated for a discounted rate. Would definitely stay here again!,5,2024,08,21
243,A hotel that I will wisit again.,Realy Nice hotel. Perfekt location in the city. Friendly staff. The dinner on the restaurant was realy good.  A hotel that I will book again in my next trip to Dublin. The horsebox Coffee did wonders .....................................,5,2024,08,21
243,Friendly and clean city centre hotel,"This was our first time staying at the Marlin hotel. It's very nice and clean, still quite new I guess.
Check in was easy and staff were helpful. It's very close to Grafton Street and St Stephens Green but on a quieter street so no noise to worry about.
Breakfast is a self service buffet and was really nice. The hotel staff kindly looked after our luggage so we could visit the shops before our flight in the evening.
The price we got was very competitive against other hotels in the area.",5,2024,08,21
243,Quality everywhere,I have to say it has a lot going for it. Location and the open layout of its reception and bar are really well fitted out. Checking in was easy and no long wait with a lot of automated options to speed it up. The food in the bar is great and the pints of Guinness are extremely good. The rooms fittings are high quality and the bed was massive and comfortable.,5,2024,08,18
243,Perfect hotel in Dublin ,"Best Hotel in Dublin. Modern, clean, very close to all attractions. A plus is the kindness of the personnel, absolutely amazing as they all are very helpful and competent. We had a great stay in this Hotel and I highly recommend it. Breakfast was great too. ",5,2024,08,18
243,Too short check in automatic but easy to do well worth another visit ,Found the building to be a bit quirky but pleasant hygiene excellent location ideal well served by public transport our room was very comfortable with big bathrooms which were adapted for elderly or physical challenged thumbs up to that while we did not use the restaurant the cooking fragrances were tempting ,4,2024,08,18
243,Cozy king is a closet of a room,"The room is so tiny and there’s no closet or dresser, just 3 hangers on hooks on the wall. And there’s only one electrical outlet in the entire room (none in the bathroom either). The lobby is nice but the rooms are sun-par. The bed is comfortable though.",2,2024,08,18
243,"Centra and quiet location, but small rooms.","Central and quiet, but extremely small room and bathroom. Small reception which focused on self check-in, but most of the guests needed help do to this on the computer. It was my husbands 60th birthday celebration, which I also mentioned when I booked the room, but nothing special was added to the room.",3,2024,08,17
243,Great stay.,"Stay was great! Myself and the misses were up for the anniversary. Got down to business pretty quick, were able ti make plenty of noise and not be disturbed.  The blind was great aswell and no one could look in at us. Overall great stay, throughly looking to coming again.",5,2024,08,17
243,Great hotel in the heart of Dublin,"Clean, convenient and well-run hotel on the heart of Dublin.  Just steps away from the bustling Temple Bar area and Saint Stephen's Green, but still quiet enough to get a good night's sleep.  Rooms are small but comfortable. Hotel staff is very helpful and polite.",5,2024,08,17
243,Over-priced but NOT oversized .........,"We booked a King room having a King Size bed - I think the bedroom was built around the bed as there was very little room to move. It only had 1 chair with no space to relax unless you used the bed. Only 2 pillows were provided so had to ask for another 2. The ensuite was small (a little over 2 sq metres) but the shower was good, only room for 1 person at a time in there. We did report the toilet seat was loose. The view out of the window was depressing so kept the blind closed. Overall, not considered good value as stayed at other hotels costing half the price with superior rooms.",3,2024,08,16
243,Will come back,"Nice and helpfull staff. Clean, quiet and cosy room (huge bed). Location just south of Temple bar area but not as loud and  crowded. There's a good variety of options for breakfast. Remark: the pillows were a bit too big for me but nothing that could prevent me from a good night sleep. We will surely come back next time when in Dublin.",4,2024,08,16
243,Clean and centrally located with great staff,"The hotel was centrally located, everything was within walking distance. 
Clean, quiet and peaceful stay. We stayed for 8 nights and enjoyed the service, the warmth and helpfulness of the staff members. Jason, Lisa, Stuart and Elvira were more than helpful. 
The breakfast was great, many choices; hot, cold and everything was fresh.",5,2024,08,15
243,Good breakfast and great amenities.,Great breakfast options especially for vegetarians and vegans. The rooms were pretty spacious for a European hotel. The lobby was nicely decorated and welcoming. We didn't use the hotel gym but it was nice to have it available onsite as many hotels don't have gyms.,5,2024,08,14
243,We did enjoy our visit and found the staff extremely helpful at all times. I would like to thank Sarah on reception with tumble ,The staff were very helpful. My only complaint was the bed. It was uncomfortable and very difficult to get out of. No bedside light for reading or a water glass.  I changed position and found better  Shower not very powerful water went on floor.,4,2024,08,14
243,Would recommend,"Great location close to the nightlife, there is a multi-storey car park just across the road from the hotel.

The room was very clean, modern and comfortable.

I would definitely stay again and recommend to anyone visiting Dublin to stay at the Marlin Hotel.",5,2024,08,14
243,Fantastic location and exceptional service,We arrived early and we were greeted and helped with bag storage. Our room was clean. The breakfast buffet was quite yummy! Our check out was well handled by Mr. Stewart who went the extra step in helping find our checked bags and arranging an earlier taxi (which proved fortuitous as there were delays at the airport!) We absolutely would recommend the Marlin to any and all friends who plan to visit Dublin!,5,2024,08,13
243,Above and beyond,Excellent service! I left my headphones and iPad locked in the room safe when I left the area. Dom helped me by getting the items and putting them in the reception safe until I was able to get them on my return back to Dublin a few days later. Thanks,5,2024,08,13
243,"Clean, convenient, fun lobby!","We love the location, so convenient. Marlin is clean, friendly, and a great place to hang out. The lobby is welcoming and fun. We had coffee in the morning and drinks in the evening in the restaurant. The rooms are clean, comfortable, and modern.  We'll be back.",5,2024,08,12
243,Lovely night @ Marlin,"Excellent location.  Lovely modern hotel. Compact room but well equipped.  Really comfortable bed. Good breakfast. Equally good bar menu. Lovely helpful staff. Will definitely book again.

 Parking quite steep - 30 euro for 24 hours - thought it might have been slightly more discounted but it is the city centre - that is the only minor negative.",5,2024,08,11
243,Lovely experience.,"Lovely experience. Easy check-in and very friendly staff. Very cozy room. Nice amenities and well-located overall. About 10-15 minutes to the core of the touristy areas. 

Highly recommend The George for a gay bar experience. The Thomas Moore Inn is right around the corner and is a nice first-stop when you arrive.",4,2024,08,11
243,Memorable and will be back,"Very comfortable nights sleep, staff were so welcoming and very attentive. The food and drink was really nice and the hotel was in a very good location and walking distance to everything you may need. Coffee dock was gorgeous and staff there very nice.",5,2024,08,11

243,Great location!,"Ideal central location!  Lovely modern hotel, quirky lobby for chilling with coffee cart.  Self check in. Staff were very helpful, attentive and friendly.  Room was small but spotless with A/C, didn't have breakfast.  Nice bar.  Staff offered to hold our luggage after check out so we didn't have to carry round town.",5,2024,08,09
243,Cool ..,"August 2024 
The position of the hotel is perfect, near the city centre but in a posh zone. 
Cool and gentle staff
Room really small and without wardrobe for a king room size but very clean.. bathroom small as well but  tidy and clean .. All in all 8/10",5,2024,08,08
243,"Great hotel, will stay again!","A wonderful stay, and a very funky hotel lobby. Ideally located in Central Dublin near shops and bars. Perfect for everything we needed. Would definitely recommend and will stay again when visiting Dublin! Very friendly staff and an easy and quick check in and out process, thank you!",5,2024,08,08

So close to everything.
Very convenient. 
Highly recommend!",5,2024,08,06
243,Modern hotel with great breakfast,"Only negative was that the room was small but had all that was needed for two nights. Not so much space for storage if you staying for a longer period. Nice hotel, modern and very central. Comfortable beds, nice decorated hotel and a great breakfast buffe'. Will definitely stay there next time I am going back to Dublin.",4,2024,08,05
243,Great 4 star hotel. ⭐️,"This hotel is lovely!! Very modern, spotlessly clean and what you see in the pictures is exactly what you get. 

All of the staff were super friendly and helpful. Service was excellent, especially in the restaurant and bar. Everywhere is open, spacious, comfortable and has a welcoming atmosphere. 

We stayed in the cosy king room which at first sight seems a little claustrophobic, but was actually really lovely!  Beds are super comfy and the air con is excellent. The room was spotlessly clean, a lovely place to chill out after a busy day/night around the city. 

The location is within 10 mins walk of Grafton Street, St Stephen’s Green Park, Dublin Castle and the Temple Bar area. Also a load of very nice restaurants just up the street. 

I would 100% recommend this hotel and would stay again!",5,2024,08,05
243,Ahhhhmazing!,"If you are looking for a place to stay in dublin, this is it! It is in the middle of what you needed to be in terms of location, it is extremely clean, the staff are very kind, and it is so trendy and fun! Having the bar right downstairs and having food available right when you need it, made it the perfect place for our stay!",5,2024,08,05
243,Marlin Hotel Dublin,"Excellent hotel, extremely clean, many modern amenities, very comfortable, great location to Grafton Street and parking. The staff were very friendly and helpful. ",5,2024,08,05
243,Great Location and Quirky,"This was my first time staying at the Marlin Hotel. Upon entering the hotel there was immediately a relaxed atmosphere. 

The staff at check-in were busy and it did take around 10 minutes for the check-in process so not the quickest. 

Owe headed to our room and upon entry the room was well presented and clean. The bed is large and more than big enough for a comfortable nights sleep too. The complimentary water and 15% discount voucher were a nice touch too. We used our voucher against some cocktails in the bar later that evening. 

The rooms are small but perfectly adequate for a base in the city centre. The bathrooms are basic but have the necessary and the rainfall shower is an added bonus for sure. 

The location of the hotel is ideal for those looking to stay around Grafton Street and explore the surrounding area or if heading to a show at the Gaiety Theatre. 

I would certainly recommend the hotel to others. 

We didn’t eat at the hotel or have breakfast so unable to comment on the food.",5,2024,08,05
243,"Cleanly, comfy, friendly, great location","Clean, excellent customer friendly service, friendly staff. I stayed for 6 nights and it was a wonderful experience.

243,Pleasant stay,"Found the hotel conveniently located. Nice and modern look. Staff friendly and obliging and bedding comfortable.

I couldn’t believe how close it was to everything. Delicious food. Breakfast and dinner delicious. All amenities. Would highly recommend.,5,2024,08,03
243,Professional and Friendly Hotel ,"On arrival, We decided to upgrade, considering it was the night after our wedding at the St Stephens Green Club, Ralfs was absolutely brilliant in this regard, he was so friendly, considerate and professional. We stayed on the 5th floor in a suite,he then offered us a complimentary drink on occasion of our wedding. A top class manager, a real gem to his company. We also found other members of staff to be engaging and helpful during our stay. ",4,2024,08,03
243,Excellent,"Friendly and helpful team.
Cozy and comfy room, though quite small.
The breakfast was very good, especially the croissants.
Excellent location close to pubs and shopping areas and the St. Stephans park where you can walk and see ducks and squirrels.",5,2024,08,03
243,Wonderful Stay,"Coming from the USA, it was a shock how friendly the city of Dublin was. From the moment we stepped in The Marlin Hotel, the staff were exceptionally kind. From the front desk, the cleaning crew, and the bar tenders; all of them were delightful. 
The food is great, the drinks are delicious, the rooms are spotless, and the 24/7 front desk was helpful.
We even met the hotel manager who personally asked us if there was anything they could do to make the guest experience better. Fortunately, we couldn’t think of anything. 
Highly recommend the stay, especially with such affordable prices!",5,2024,08,03
243,Hospitality Redefined,"As the first stop of our 5 city trip across Europe, Marlin Hotel in Dublin was the benchmark for us for the rest of the trip.  Hotel is nothing short of fantastic.  Staff is just wonderful and go out of their way to provide everything beyond expectations.  Much thanks to Victoria, Lisa, Jason, Emmanuel and others that we interacted with.  Highly recommend this hotel and I will definitely be back here if my travel included Dublin.",5,2024,08,02
243,"Fun, funky, and QUIET","This was probably my favorite hotel of the 4 we stayed in during our trip. It was fun, and comfortable, with really amazing staff. They were helpful in explaining the bus map to us, arranging for a cab to the airport. The bar is great, and the breakfast buffet was excellent. Also, at the end of our trip, most importantly, it was QUIET.",5,2024,08,01
243,Great holidays at the Marlin,Excellent place. Modern and Cosy. Near all the rights places. Great beakfast. Comfortably beds. All the staff was very kind and helpful. The only complain is that the bedroom cleaning wasn’t always good as all the other services of the hotel.,5,2024,08,01
243,Delightful in Every Way,"This was my second stay at the Marlin.  The same delightful milieu, great sleeping, good food, and terrifically helpful and courteous staff.  A special shout-out to Lisa for her expert help in finding an obscure address.  I recommend the Marlin without reservation. I love staying there.",5,2024,08,01
243,Staff need retraining,"I travelled to this hotel with my sisters, we are aged between 31-35. First impressions were great, the hotel is beautiful, the room is of a good size and the location is excellent -  however the conduct of one staff member left more to be desired. 

On Sunday 28th, we went to the bar at the hotel to order cocktails. We waited around 6/7 minutes before being acknowledged. 
I ordered a cocktail and he started to make it - he seemed unsure, reading guidance notes but I didn’t mind this. 
A couple minutes into making the drink, a woman approached the bar. He immediately stopped what he was doing to serve her, then proceeded to make her drink - instead of encouraging her to wait like I had to. He then went to retrieve the card machine for her to make her payment. I found this so disgusting - I waited to be served, patiently may I add - so for him to drop me to serve her and fully complete her order was humiliating and very upsetting. I walked away and he watched me do this - no apology at all. 

I will never ever stay at this hotel when I next visit Dublin. My sister has a huge online following (we paid for our trip as it wasn’t for business) and she will share this story with her followers.",3,2024,07,30
243,10/10 would stay again!,"the bed was incredibly comfortable and having AC was a dream. the hotel was very clean, and had many wonderful amenities. even in the comfy king room we had a lot of floor space for our 2 suitcases. it was a good location as well, walkable to a lot of restaurants and grafton street!",5,2024,07,29
243,Brilliant,Beautiful room the Cosy king room clever use of space Ina small room. Bed was so comfy and pillows fab too. The atmosphere in the bar and outside was so warm and friendly. We sat outside till closing with our gins in a calm peaceful setting outside. Really enjoyed our stay will definitely be back for a Christmas show as right near the gaiety and shops too. Nightlife was good too buzzing everywhere lots of tourists about. Restaurants nearby very good especially the Gotham .,5,2024,07,29
243,"Great stay, would stay again","Lovely hotel in a great location by St Stephens green bars, restaurant, cafes and shopping. Rooms weren't the biggest but wasn't a problem as we were only there to sleep, rooms very clean and modern. Beds very comfy, residents bar had a good atmosphere and the coffee hub in reception was great",5,2024,07,29
243,Comfortable,"Really comfortable and easy to find, great location for all work, tourists etc.  Service very good staff friendly",5,2024,07,29
243,A hidden gem!,"I visited Dublin for the first time on a 2 day business trip.

The Marlin hotel was just perfect!

The location was really central without it being busy or noisy.

I spent a lot of time in the lobby with a colleague doing work which was an all round great experience.

The bedroom was clean, comfy and had everything you could need any more.

Would recommend to anyone!",5,2024,07,29
243,Great hotel and great location,"We’d stayed north of the Liffey previously so was keen to see what the south had to offer. Research prior to going suggested I’d made a good choice and the reality was exactly that. The Marlin’s location is excellent - great shopping, plenty of bars and restaurants etc. The staff who greeted us on arrival were very helpful and friendly and that was a theme throughout all our interactions with them during our stay. Rooms are designed to be compact but has everything you need and are in great condition. Shower and bathroom were great and in good order. We used the bar in the hotel and that was relaxed with a great atmosphere and decent Guinness (it is Dublin after all). I’d have no hesitation in staying here again and will recommended to any visitors looking for a decent hotel at the heart of the city’s leisure location.",5,2024,07,28
243,Great stay at the Marlin.,We had such a great experience at the Marlin Hotel. The staff were friendly and helpful. The rooms were very clean and had everything we needed for a fantastic stay in Dublin. It is in a great location too. Close to everything we wanted to do. When our plans changed and we needed to change our arrival time they were flexible. Would highly recommend this hotel!,5,2024,07,27
243,Great Experience,"Everything I needed, plus being able to check in early and extend checkout was great because I got in early a.m. friom U.S. Excellent location, friendly and efficient staff.",5,2024,07,27
243,Best hotel we stayed at in Ireland!,"During our time in Ireland we stayed in 5 hotels and this was by far the best, better than the other 4 combined. Everything is modern and convenient. It was clean and the staff genuinely cared about our wellbeing. ",5,2024,07,26
243,Modern hotel in the heart of Dublin at reasonable prices,"Top Location, fully electronic check-in and -out although there is human support if you need it. Rooms are smallish but modern in every aspect. There is ample  (work)space in the reception area for small meetings and there is a coffee bar as well. We didn't use the drinks bar nor breakfast area, but it is there.",5,2024,07,25
243,Super Hotel,"This hotel is ideally situated for a stay in Dublin - close to the Gaiety theatre , Rock and Roll museum and Temple bar. The hotel itself is lovely and we loved the design of the bedroom. We had a fantastic stay here and will definitely be staying again.",5,2024,07,25
243,Excellent quality hotel in very central location,"Excellent quality hotel in very central location.   Easy walking access into town only a few minutes away with loads of restaurants and bars etc.   The hotel and room itself was spotlessly clean and done to a high standard.  Yes, the rooms are a bit small but this is a city centre hotel not a countryside retreat.    However the bed is large and very comfortable and the en-suite bathroom was well designed and had all we needed.   Breakfast in the morning was good,  nothing spectacular but the food was freshly cooked and good quality ingredients.    Overall - a good choice if you need a hotel in this area.",5,2024,07,25
243,Loved this hotel,"Stayed overnight in a cosy king room which was ideal for my needs. Not a big room but a huge comfy bed, great bathroom and clean. The staff were fantastic and friendly. They realised that I was with my friend and, without asking, booked us rooms close to each other. Well located for what I needed, close to St Stephen’s Green, Trinity etc.
Very pleased I chose this hotel",5,2024,07,25
243,Staff and Location were Perfect,"The location of this hotel is perfect. The room might have been a bit small, but the bed was very comfortable. The breakfast was very tasty and offered a good variety. The staff was easily the best part of this hotel. They were very friendly and helpful.",5,2024,07,24
243,Marlin... the hotel to meet your needs with charm and effective problem solving ideas.,"Everyone, everything was made available to make my visit comfortable. The room was efficient and full of accommodations that served my needs. The location was within walking distance to most areas of interest to me. I will definitely stay here  next time in Dublin.",5,2024,07,24
243,Just what I needed,"This place was central, comfortable and the room is perfect for one person. The staff were helpful and the breakfast was really good. I read reviews that discussed the room which does have a few odd design choices but again it was just what I needed.",5,2024,07,21
243,"Marlin Hotel, city centre on your doorstep.","The Marlin Hotel is very central to Graftan Street so you are on the doorstep of all the shops,  One minute walk to Stephens Green Shopping Centte.

243,"Loved , Ireland vacay !!!","The staff was wonderful!  The first day we arrived we were not sure of where to eat, we love the recommendation so much... we asked again the second night.    the location was close to all we wanted to see !  Well within walking distance. When we did need a cab, we went to the front desk, and they ordered one to the front of the hotel.",5,2024,07,19
243,Just great,"Great location close to Temple Bar area. You can easily walk.

Well appointed rooms for a pod hotel. Clean.

Very helpful and friendly staff.

Public multistory carpark across the road and you get a decent discount from the hotel.

Has its own bar that opens at 1700

Will stay again.",5,2024,07,19
243,Worth a stay,"Friendly staff, comfortable rooms, well priced and great location. Would be great for a business or personal trip

My only negative would be the views out of the window on on side of the hotel, as it over looks some run down flats/apartments; but don't let this put you off.",5,2024,07,18
243,Great hotel!,"A modern and cozy hotel, close to many restaurants and bars but in a quiet area. I stayed in the single bed room and it was just right for one person. The hotel has a bar/restaurant with friendly staff and fair prices. There is a coffee cafe in the morning which is really convenient. I would definitely stay again!",5,2024,07,18
243,The perfect location and experience for our family of 4,"Our entire family of 4 was incredibly pleased with the Hotel Marlin during our 5-night Dublin stay. The lobby is clean, fun, modern, lounge-worthy and filled with amenities and space. I don't believe my kids (3, 6) entered the lobby once without enjoying a 'ride' on the vespa scooter, or taking a photo in the complimentary photo booth. There was plenty of space for business travelers to meet colleagues, have a drink, work on their computer, etc. The check-in process was insanely easy and quick, and all staff were super approachable and eager to assist. The bar was nice, and the restaurant was fine; we had a few snafus with our food and service but the manager was quick to remedy them. 

The location was perfect. Just on the outskirts of the 'hub' so it wasn't noisy but a quick walk to the shops, pubs, and fun. Bus was a 9 minute walk away, parks about 5 and we were across from a mall. The laundry in the basement was a necessity and surprisingly very popular. It was a nice touch that it was complimentary. The lobby also has a little coffee 'truck' that had a nice breakfast menu for days we were on the go. 

As for the rooms - we had a corner room that included a comfy King bed partitioned away from the main living area that included a fold out sofa bed for our kiddos to sleep in (fully made up upon arrival which was a nice touch!) This room also had a little seating area/table, coffee table and a 'wet bar' complete with a small fridge. The windows had remote control black-out curtains. The bathroom was lovely and spacious. It was so nice to come back from a full day of fun to a clean, modern, AC'ed hotel room. Our family was incredibly happy with this hotel and would highly recommend the hotel and room!",5,2024,07,17
243,Good stay,"This is a lLovely modern hotel, with very cool public areas. Bedroom small but comfortable with good shower and excellent air conditioning . Location could be better but all in all we had an enjoyable experience. Staff were friendly and helpful",5,2024,07,17
243,Top Class Stay,"This is my second time staying in the Marlin Hotel and I was so happy with the service again! I Stayed in May 2024 and decided to go down for a few days to Dublin. The staff are friendly and welcoming, the rooms are spotless and the facilities are brilliant. Truly a hidden gem in Dublin!",5,2024,07,17
243,Great location and hotel,"Me and my sister enjoyed our over night stay at Marlin Hotel. The room was clean and bed was very comfortable. We paid for breakfast the next day and we couldn't fault it, fresh food. We would happily stop here again and recommend it to anyone in the future. The location was great only 8 minute walk to temple bar and was allowed to check in 35 minutes early. 

Thanks for a great stay",5,2024,07,15
243,Great Stay,"Fabulous location!! Wonderful modern hotel. Great room. Overall a great stay. Highly recommended. Will stay there again if we come back to Dublin again.

243,Great location,"Location is superb! Walking distance to shops with a mall close by. Recommend staying here. There is an early check-in option (which we were not told about) but did use the late checkout option for 1 of our rooms. You can choose to stay as late as 6pm, for an added cost.",4,2024,07,12
243,Amazing location and very clean!,Amazing hotel! The staff is very accommodating and nice. VERY clean and any request I asked for I had them knocking on my door in 10 minutes. GREAT location. No complaints at all! Their coffee bar in the lobby is also amazing. 7 minute walk to Grafton street and 12 minute walk to the temple bar area!,5,2024,07,11
243,Very Good; Not Perfect,"This was a nice hotel, but not perfect. The location was great, it was clean, the beds were comfortable and the staff was very accommodating. On the negative side, the rooms were very small (and we had 2 of the larger rooms), the water pressure was extremely low, and due to the modern decor, there was insufficient counter space in the bathroom and less than ideal closet and drawer space for clothes. The rates were fairly high for what we got, but we were there in the height of the tourist season and it was centrally located so we could walk to everything. Would recommend!",4,2024,07,11
243,Best hotel in Dublin,"First and foremost, extremely accommodating staff. Almost without exception  they were kind 
friendly and went out of their way to help. This included front desk  dining room and housekeeping.  Very quiet location, though only steps from the ""action."" Lovely firm beds. Modern bathroom. Free Laundry on premises, though their driers arent very efficient. Best brown bread in Ireland!",5,2024,07,11
243,5 star,"Amazing cool decor, bedroom was small but very reasonably priced and extremely comfortable.  It was a pity the restaurant wasn't open for lunch as we would have liked to eat there but the coffee truck with snacks was a great bonus. Staff very friendly and helpful, all in all a very pleasant stay.",5,2024,07,11
243,Perfect overnight hotel,"Super location , within walking distance to so many tourist attractions and shopping areas. Executive room plenty of room, king size bed, lovely bathroom .with shower. Very helpful staff. Hotel spotless in all areas. Definitely will return.",5,2024,07,10
243,Great hotel in central Dublin,"Great hotel  check-in super easy.rooms are compact, but the bed is so comfortable.Air con is best i have experienced in any hotel.overall, a great stay, the location is good.can't wait to return . Bar is expensive for drinks.lovely, coffee dock and seating area ",4,2024,07,10
243,Comfortable room and great location,"The bed was incredibly comfortable and the room conveniently organized for storage in spite of being relatively small (which we knew, of course). We appreciated the location, which was the main reason for choosing the Marlin. The comfort of a good night's sleep was really helpful!",5,2024,07,10
243,Great stay,"Rooms are comfortable and compact. Best nights sleep I had in a while. Located right beside Q Park car park (though get hotel deal, as we had precooked so cost more)
We were down for a concert in Iveagh Gardens, super central location. Great vibe in hotel and surrounding areas..! Enjoy..!! ",5,2024,07,09
243,Central,"Really clean very centrally placed hotel . Good of attending a show. 
Nice modern design when you enter ( or at least it seemed modern to me!). Smooth checking process , albeit self-checking which i’m not a fan of .

Room was spotless , small, bit the bed was really , really comfortable. .",4,2024,07,09
243,"Great stay, great location","Great service, excellent location, room fitting the purpose including good ventilation, modern bed, tidy & clean. We’ll be back here at the next trip. Breakfast was good. Is there anything we’d wish for, then it would be a bigger safe (fitting a laptop) and a small fridge",5,2024,07,08
243,Disappointing experience,Hotel is good. Staff are nice and helpful. I arrived at around 2pm and asked about checkin. I was told that checkin time was 3. Which of course I know is standard for every hotel. The receptionist then said. There are rooms ready now but if you want to get early check in you have to pay additional €20. I could understand it if you wanted to book an early check in in advance then paid for it.  But absolutely disgusted with this attitude asking for additional money just to get access to the room a few minutes early.,3,2024,07,08
243,All you need is there but…quite expensive and a room very narrow (size of the bed). Excellent breakfast,Hôtel quite expensive and a room very narrow (size of the bed). Excellent location. Excellent breakfast ,4,2024,07,08
243,Super comfy trip,Really nice rooms with very comfortable beds and linen. Super showers. Friendly staff and a super functional lobby. The location is fabulous. With parking nearby and access to all the shopping within 5 minutes walk. Highly recommended for travellers to Dublin.,5,2024,07,07
243,Loved my stay!,"I had a lovely stay at the Marlin. I came to Dublin for a solo birthday trip for myself and I couldn't have asked for more comfortable accommodations. I stayed in the Cosy King room, which was very comfortable for just me, but if I come back with my partner, I'd probably upgrade to something bigger. The bed was super comfortable but the room itself probably would've been a bit too small for a couple. The room had a desk and a chair, a big drawer under the bed, three hangers on the wall, and a small shelf near the door. The bathroom is decently sized, though, and I enjoyed the L'Occitane toiletries.
I do wish some of their amenities were better advertised. I had no idea there was a free laundry room in the basement for guests to use until my last day! I definitely would have used it earlier on in my trip if I'd have known.
The hotel is beautifully designed, and there's lots of space in the lobby to just hang out. It smelled lovely, too, but I think whatever they were using to pump in the scent was a little too strong. I'm sensitive to smells and there were times I'd come in and the scent was uncomfortably strong.
Location-wise, the hotel is very central, and there is a Lidl and a Tesco Express within walking distance for groceries and anything you might need. Stephen's Green is a block away, perfect for a nice picnic, and Stephen's Green Shopping Centre is right next door as well. I truly enjoyed my stay and I can't wait to come back!",5,2024,07,07
243,"Lovely hotel, great location","Great location, very central and close to shopping area, restaurants and bars. We were met by very friendly staff and we had a small but perfectly comfortable room.
We stayed for one night this time, we've stayed here before and we'd come back again.",5,2024,07,07
243,Very Happy Stay.,"Large comfy bed. Super soft pillows. Great shower & loved L'Occitaine Toiletries. Very friendly & helpful staff. , very welcoming. Lovely vibe to place. Really enjoyed food at tge bar. Lobby was lovely. Will stay again.great price and location.",5,2024,07,06
243,The perfect place to stay in Dublin,"The Marlin Hotel is a funky gem in the St Stephen’s Green area.  It’s about a 10 minute walk to Trinity College, St Patrick’s Cathedral, and Temple Bar. A full and fun shopping center is a block away just at the head of the main shopping area of Grafton Street. So yes, convenient. Best of all, the staff. The adorable Horsebox Coffee stall, convenient computer bar, comfy places to hang out, a photo box, doorway marked “When Nature Calls” (use ur imagination), a restaurant with a talented chef and areas that can be booked for meetings or parties round up the public assets. The bathrooms are well laid out, the beds are comfy. The rooms easy to access but secured with room key access. As, you’ve guessed by now, I highly recommend it!",5,2024,07,06
243,Fantastic Hotel ,Really enjoyed our stay in this hotel.  In a great location in the city centre.  It has a real funky and modern style. The cozy room while it was cozy it was very comfortable and had most things you need in a hotel room.  The only thing missing was an iron.  Staff were friendly and efficient. Will 100% stay here again,5,2024,07,06
243,Great location and service,Fantastic location close to Grafton Street. Modern rooms with the option to go bigger. Breakfast buffet is one of the best we have had and the coffee is as good as they say. Staff are extremely helpful from assisting with check-in to luggage storage which is a real free bonus.,4,2024,07,06
243,Huge Comfy Bed - but not much space,"The bed was very comfortable and pillows incredibly soft however the room was tiny and the bed completely dominated the space with no room to unpack your suitcase. We were also dissapointed that although our room was ready a few hours early for check in, the hotel wanted to charge us extra to do so. This was not negotiable and a very different experience to the many other hotels we had stayed in during our trip.",3,2024,07,05
243,Great hotel!,"Have stayed there the last 3 times we’ve been in Dublin, no hesitation to book this hotel. Comfiest bed we’ve ever stayed in !",5,2024,07,05
243,A great place to stay,"My friend and I spent three nights at the Marlin.  The room had tasteful decor, very comfortable beds, good insulation from noise and light (very effective blackout curtains), good lighting (we like to read), a coffee machine, and plenty of storage space for clothes and other items should you want to empty your suitcase. The central location is a bonus. We were very happy with our choice.",5,2024,07,05
243,Love this hotel,"Beautiful hotel and accommodations.  Modern and up to date. Great central location to St Stephen's Green, I have stayed in many hotels in Dublin and this is one of my favorites. Grafton Street and restaurants and attractions.

Little bit expensive in my opinion but location is great for central Dublin,sightseeing, concerts,luas etc",4,2024,07,03
243,Family Visit to Dublin,Excellent hotel! We enjoyed our stay immensely.  The room was very large and had plenty of space for our family of 4.  The food was very good and the location was perfect.  We were able to walk to everything we wanted to see.  Staff was super helpful and knowledgeable.  Would definitely stay here again and recommend to others.,5,2024,07,01
243,Not bad but not worth the money.,"Lobby is fancy and cool. Reception too small and confusing. Basically unintentionally skipped the line as neither staff nor I did not know who was waiting to be served or who was just there. Further  during the day one staff was usually seated on some table and not sure if no reception duty is clear fir this role but as a guest a bit weird ti have a q and some staff ignoring you.
Check-in has to be done by machine. Fancy but reminds me of easyjet hotel we had in my hometown. 
Early check-in is charged (except if group booking?) regardless if there is availability. Feels very cheap to me but maybe old fashioned and just expect too much from a 4-star hotel.
Room was nice. Small things were not consistent during the stay between 2 rooms but not s big deal. 
Had a flickering light bulb it was taken care off.
Bar was nice.
Booked 2 rooms and due to unforseen circumstances did not need the 2nd one. We booked non-refundable rate so no issue with that.But as often in Dublin suggested to move rhe date but exception was not granted.Which they have absolutely the right to but from hotels that label them on this level experienced more flexibility.
Summary: One gets way better value in Dublin. It is a bit like a low-cost carrier pretending to be a full service airline. Would stay if price is right and put into above mindset.
",3,2024,07,01
243,Minimalist NON secure open WiFi,The hotel is centrally located. The rooms have a minimalist interior but separate nice bathroom (no closets). The hotel only has OPEN WiFi which is bad for an international traveler. I had to go to my coffee shop (outside the hotel) to get a secure WiFi. For $300/night ( Taylor Swift) a good WiFi seems a must. I may go back because of the location but …..,3,2024,07,01

243,Above and beyond service from Lea,"Cosy & modern hotel with some quirky feats like the photo booth, cake and coffee truck at the entry but also a great full Irish breakfast with soda bread. The most attentive detail was given to us by Lea the duty manager. Just incidentally we mentioned that we stayed in Dublin to celebrate our anniversary. Returning to the room after a nice evening out, we were amazed to find a tasty cake in our room which mentioned in chocolate letters: happy anniversary. Thanks so much Lea for the great treatment!",5,2024,06,29
243,Great central hotel highly recommend,Modern hotel. Could not be more convenient and central. Very efficient online registration and in person check in. Great experience with staff.

Beautiful room design .
Check in a little bit complex with the digital tablet better with the management in charge .
Beautiful hotel location in downtown.",4,2024,06,28
243,Nice hotel. Annoying computer ck’in island.,"Other than the checkin computer island -it was very nice.  Waiting in line  to check in with a machine is not my idea of fun. 

The front desk people were knowledgeable and helpful. 

Breakfast tasted like real eggs.  Covered all of the bases. Nice patio",4,2024,06,28

243,Great spot!,"Great location, space and amenities!! We booked our trip on and found the right spot. Easy access to grafton street and temple bar area but not surrounded by the noise. One of a few places we found with AC, king bed and a quality gym. Wish breakfast was included, but worth it.",5,2024,06,26
243,Average hotel,"Me and my fiancé came here for one night. The hotel looks really nice & smart! Downstairs there is a little coffee area selling sweet treats - there is also a bar. When we arrived at 12pm we had to pay an extra €30 for check in as check in was not until 3pm which we thought was late. We paid the €30 however placing our bags in storage was an option. We had some issues with our card when trying to check in and pay ( causing stress ) - a small complaint would be that we asked for some assistance from a lady who worked there, when assisting us she kept taking key cards from other customers and writing information down, taking to other customers and staff members when we was asking for support and help, we found this very rude when she should of had attention on us throughout helping us. - this took longer due to her serving other customers! The hotel was very clean. Bedrooms are very small just a standard bed in a room but extremely comfortable! In all honestly we probably would not stay here again, overall the hotel was just average.",3,2024,06,25
243,Pleasant stay at Marlin Hotel,"We stayed in a Cosy King room while attending the Rammstein concert. The room was small but had everything we needed..large comfy bed and nice quality working shower. The room was very clean also. We asked for a quiet room and stayed on the fifth floor and we had a great nights sleep. The staff were very helpful and engaging, even during a very busy check-in. I would highly recommend for a short stay.",4,2024,06,25
243,Wonderful stay!,"Great hotel in an excellent location. Very walkable, right in city center location. Hotel lobby & amenities have a great feel - really cute coffee cart and lobby, including a fun photo booth. On-site breakfast was also great. Highly recommend.",5,2024,06,24
243,Concert Stay,The rooms are clean and practical with all the great amenities you need. Centrally located with access to everything but still quiet and easy to relax. The bar is fab and the staff are very friendly and helpful. The coffee horse box is a lovely touch and a great cup of coffee too,5,2024,06,24
243,Stuart saves the day!,"From the minute I walked into this hotel there was a sense of calm. Beautiful reception with check in counters available. I didn't need help but I made quick eye contact with the person in reception, he came over to ask if I needed assistance. He was very pleasant and easy to chat with. His name was Stuart and the fact that he was supposed to be off but got called in did not stop him from being friendly and happy! After checking in I got to my room. It was a little small so I went back down to reception and Stuart kindly upgraded my room at no additional cost. Very very impressed with Stuart and his impeccable customer service. My stay at the Marlin was so lovely and blissfully relaxing. I totally recommend this place. 👌",5,2024,06,24
243,Lovely stay,"Great location, beautiful clean hotel and friendly helpful staff. The coffee truck in the lobby was a good addition and the hotel decor was fabulous.

243,Fantastic Stay,"Went for a 1 night stay here to attend a concert in the Aviva. Could not fault the place at all. Even though it was extremely busy, self check-in was quick and easy as there was plenty staff to assist. Room was small but all that was needed for a hotel room was provided. Room was spotless, bed linen was clean and crisp, bed was very comfortable and reception has a great vibe from it 👍

Would definitely stay here again",5,2024,06,22
243,"Great Hotel in the Heart of Dublin, But Kinda Pricey.","Two caveats right off the bat.  One, this place is expensive.  Two, unless you're traveling with just a backpack, or alone, do NOT rent the ""Cozy King"" room.  It is only as wide as a king size bed, and you must crawl into the bed from the bottom, not the sides.  There is no closet, and a little pod bathroom.  There is no room for any luggage bigger than a carry on. It's smaller than a cruise ship cabin--a lot smaller, and they want $291 US a night for this.  I went to the desk and asked about a bigger room, and was charged another $65 US a night for a nice room twice the size--grand total, $356 US a night.  Parking a car will set you back another $32.50 a night.

Now, for the good news. This hotel is very clean and modern, with 3 large, fast elevators.  Check in and out is a breeze. It is just one block away from all the action on Noel Purcell Walk where all the pubs and restaurants are, and walking distance to St. Stephens Green and many other Dublin attractions. (First three rules of real estate?  Location, Location, Location--hence the $356 a night).  There was an ice machine on our floor.  Comfy bed in a room with nice views.  We were there for 2 days and room service made up the room as if we hadn't been there yet on the second day!  Very friendly and helpful staff.

So, if price is no object, and you're looking for a great hotel right in the heart of Dublin, then this is the place.  If ""size matters"", skip the cozy king and get the bigger room.",5,2024,06,22
243,Irish vibe at it's finest,"The room was similar to some Japanese rooms...fairly compact with a spacious bed.
Electric blinds and curtains.
The gym again compact has SOA fitness machines.
The touch of ""quirkiness"" to the reception area is lovely.
Throughout the hotel a very friendly warm vibe....
The staff are delightful.
The location is excellent for the city...with the Gaiety just around the corner Riverdance Show is a must see... really.enjoyed the spectacular performance.
A great selection of local restaurants in this area...I enjoyed Gourmet burger, Morroccan Couscous and Indian Tandoori and Balti.
Definite re- book for me...when in Dublin in the future.
Loved the hotel vibe and very much me..!!",5,2024,06,21
243,Really good in the heart of Dublin,"Brilliant - Great Location - we stayed for concert at Aviva and it’s only a 35 min walk, passing lots of bars and restaurants on the way.
Some rooms are small - you can pay for bigger - but they are very clean, super comfortable and very practical.
Bar, restaurant and foyer are very nice with modern decor and staff super helpful.
I know prices vary but the rate we got made it an absolute bargain for the location.",5,2024,06,21
243,Marlin Stay,"Clean rooms, hip environment, and a very convenient location.  The amenities are quite convenient and the staff are very helpful.  I had an emergency document that needed to be printed, and the staff stood by and made sure that it was taken care of.  They took the time to make sure that my problem was resolved in a timely manner.",5,2024,06,20
243,Good hotel in Dublin ,"Nice hotel close to Grafton Street. We stayed here for two nights before going on a mini road trip around Ireland. The location itself is okay, but the approach itself is not in the nicest part of Dublin. Nonetheless the hotel itself is really nice and is quite chic inside. The staff are all lovely and really helpful. It has all amenities, a nice bar and a good breakfast. If you want breakfast out there are a fair few cafes in close proximity. Would recommend ",5,2024,06,20
243,One night stay,"Great hotel, gym is a little small but useful. Rooms are clean and tidy and perfectly functioning. No room service, but a fantastic bar/kitchen downstairs. Great hotel and perfectly positioned to allow you to explore Dublin. Check in and check out was very very fast.",5,2024,06,20
243,My first trip to Ireland.,"There was a wonderful concierge named Victoria who was very kind and helpful to me. Another concierge named Lisa was also very kind and helpful.
No refrigerator in the room was missed.
Poor selection and unstocked vending machines. 
Drinks in the bar very expensive.",3,2024,06,18
243,Outstanding for the price and location,Super hotel in a fabulous location. Nothing is too much to ask. A minor problem was sorted by the wonderful Stuart in no time at all.

243,The Perfect Dublin Experience,"The staff at The Marlin Hotel in Dublin were superior.  Especially, Rolfs, he was extremely helpful the day we arrived and the day we left.  He rang for a taxi and made sure we knew where we were going.  I would definitely recommend this hotel!  It is conveniently located and very inviting.",5,2024,06,17
243,Best location for experiencing Dublin as a solo traveler,"Location, location, location. They are able to offer such good prices because the rooms are relatively small, but they are intelligently designed so they are not cramped. Cozy is a better word. The shower was really nice as well. I'm not the type to drink out of a mini bar or unpack my clothes into a wardrobe so their absences didn't bother me at all. There is plenty to eat, drink, and buy just across the street. The staff were absolutely wonderful and very helpful. They helped me get a cab and held my bags in storage while I went to newgrange, free of charge. There is also an outdoor lounge where I was able to smoke a pipe in peace.",5,2024,06,17
243,Great experience,We were able to leave our bags before check in and enjoy the day. The bed was very comfortable. Guest service was great.

These are just a few of the things that made our stay at Marlin perfect for the time we had in Dublin. Thank you for the hospitality!",5,2024,06,13
243,"Great location. Clean, modern hotel.","Very Nice hotel in an excellent location. The rooms are not large, but just what you need. Modern lobby, check in is on computers but staff is available to help and are very helpful. We did not use the restaurants/bar as we were only there one night. Location is right near Grafton Street. Dublin Express bus stop to the airport was about a 10 minute walk away. Very close to St. Stephen's Green. All in all a good value of the money and a comfortable place to sleep.",5,2024,06,11
243,Great location and very comfortable,"Loved the location of this hotel, very central, everything you need is within a minutes walking distance. 

Lovely staff, very smooth check in & check out. The beds are very comfortable and rooms very clean. ",5,2024,06,11

From the moment we arrived, we were met with warmth, professionalism, and genuine hospitality. Every aspect of our stay exceeded expectations, from the pristine accommodations and delicious cuisine to the prompt and courteous front desk service.

243,5 star stay in The Marlin Hotel St. Stephen’s Green,We stayed in the hotel for only one night but would have stayed many more!!! Booked a really cosy beautiful king size room and breakfast. All the staff there was so extremely helpful and lovely especially Gemma in the restaurant who looked after us all morning and also gave us tips about what to do and where to go while we were in Dublin for the day. Would definitely recommend a stay in this hotel.,5,2024,06,10
243,Overnight stay,"Only had the one night but was great!! We went to watch riverdance and the hotel was less than a 5 minute walk to the Gaiety theatre, Grafton St and St Stephens Park. Couldn’t fault location, cleanliness or service",5,2024,06,10
243,Fantastic city break,"We have stayed in the Hotel many times and cannot recommend it enough.  The staff go out of their way to help.  The beds are so comfortable and overall a fantastic location in the centre of Dublin.

The Hotel is situated right in the heart of Dublin.",5,2024,06,09
243,"Perfectly located, AMAZING staff.","We loved this hotel. It is PERFECTLY located and the staff are so helpful! We were with our 6 month old and they got us checked in early and had a modern, clean and perfect pack and play all set up for us in advance. 

The central air was great and the coffee cart was the perfect morning pick me up. Only complaint is that the coffee cart doesn’t open until 7am and for those of us who are used to North American coffee houses that open at 6, this is a small thing but worth noting! 

The restaurant wasn’t anything special but the service was good.",5,2024,06,07
243,Funky,"Lovely clean hotel,  very modern design, friendly staff. The location is very convenient to access Grafton street and St. Stephens  Green,  a nice ""coffee cart"" in the lobby,  if you don't fancy a full on breakfast. Bed very comfortable,  although She who must be obeyed did complain about noise/ perhaps lobby muzak,  so maybe go for a  floor above level 2.",5,2024,06,05
243,"Friendly staff, great location","The staff were incredibly helpful, even when dealing with terribly jet-lagged visitors :-)  The hotel was also in an ideal location - far enough away from the Temple Bar District to avoid some of the noise/crowds, but close enough to easily walk to every destination we wished to visit in the city. I would not hesitate to stay there again.",5,2024,06,04
243,"Amazing experience, wonderful staff","Such friendly, welcoming and extremely helpful staff. Lovely, clean room. Very convenient location - could walk to everywhere we wanted to in Dublin. Shower was high spec and powerful. Bed was big and comfy - even in the 'cosy king room'. Loved the decor of the hotel - quirky and fun.",5,2024,06,03
243,Best sleep ever,"Hotel is in excellent location and has friendly and helpful staff, the rooms are perfect and the bed was so comfortable, it was the best sleep I've had when away in a long time, breakfast was delicious and very generous, I would highly recommend The Marlin to anyone.",5,2024,06,02
243,4 STAR HOTEL WITH 5 STAR SERVICE AND LOCATION,"Location was what made us choose this hotel however the service,  decor and style of the hotel is why its getting 5 stars
From ease of check in to bar and breakfast,  the service and attention to detail was superb. Great Central location. 
Foyer facilties like the coffee truck were a quirky addition",5,2024,05,31
243,Wonderful staff,"Modern hotel, very nicely located near Stephen's Green, in walking distance to many attractions, Temple Bar, St Patdick's Cathedral, etc. We got a corner room, very spacious, clean, with a great view. The best thing however, was the staff. So sorry we didn't get their individual names, but they were all super nice and helpful. Absolutely outstanding. If management knows who fronted the desk between May 27-29, give them a raise, please :)",5,2024,05,31
243,"Lovely comfortable hotel, in a fantastic location with friendly and helpful staff and serves delicious and tasty food.",The Marlin Hotel is in a fantastic location in Dublin City. It is a very comfortable hotel with a lovely atmosphere. The staff are friendly and helpful and the food in the restaurant is delicious. The rooms are cozy and were perfect for our stay. I would recommend this hotel for your stay in Dublin. I will be back again.,5,2024,05,31
243,Great overnight stay in Dublin,"Comfy beds, clean and cosy. Cosy room is slightly on the small side but not bad for one night. Good value for money. Staff are super accommodating and got to check in early for a small fee too. Not too far from the centre and other popular areas to visit",5,2024,05,31
243,"Modern, groovy, colourful stay in central dublin","I stayed here for one night when in Dublin for business. It is a really lovely place, v modern, v colourful, great staff and spitting distance from Grafton Street. Loved the room - clean comfortable and modern. 
The breakfast was great and the dining area really pleasant and bright and yes again really cool and modern. I would just ask mgt to consider making coffee station in restaurant more accessible to persons on wheel chairs. It would be near perfect then!",5,2024,05,30
243,"Excellent Stay, will definetly be returning!","Thanks for the lovely stay! I’ll start by saying Victoria was extremely kind and genuine which was a welcome change of pace from our usual American hotel experience. She was very helpful in getting us situated and did a great job making us actually feel welcome. We were very grateful after a long day of traveling to be assisted by someone as friendly and patient as herself. Anna was also very helpful and professional. She handled herself well when dealing with some less than savory guests that came in, and did an excellent job maintaining her composure (far better than I could), so I commend her for that. She was very patient with us while we tried to get our boarding passes printed. All the other staff we dealt with were great as well, and proactive in trying to ensure we had a good stay! 

The rooms were nice. We ended up with two handicap accessible rooms and one standard room, which is different from what we are used to but not an unwelcome change. The standard room was a bit different in terms of the bed layout in that it is tucked against the window with access being from the foot of the bed, so I would advice asking about your room setup if you have any mobility issues or anything to that effect. The bathrooms had speakers in the ceiling with a media hub in the main room, and the volume control in the bathroom so just keep that in mind. All in all the rooms were pretty nice and the beds were very comfortable.  There are plenty of things to do very close to the hotel, but the hotel is tucked away making it surprisingly quiet with all the activity nearby. 
To make a long story short I am not one to usually give a five star review, but with everything mentioned I have to say this was probably the best stay I’ve had on our trip and I’d say the best hotel experience I’ve had in quite some time. So once again thank you to the wonderful staff, I’m sure I’ll be back again next time I’m in Dublin!",5,2024,05,29
243,Best stay in Dublin,"We had a great time, all staff was awesome from the moment we arrived, very helpful and friendly. The rooms were clean and very functional, the hotel is located very close to most interest points in Dublin center and you can get everywhere by foot easily",5,2024,05,29
243,Comfortable stay in very pleasant hotel,"Large, comfortable bed; friendly and accommodating staff; good location (right next to Stephen's Green); crispy battered fish and well cooked skinny chips served in the bar; small room but had everything I needed for two nights on a business trip (including hair conditioner which is always a bonus). Will gladly stay again if the price is reasonable.",5,2024,05,29
243,Great location for city centre,Great location close to city centre and the hotel itself was clean with great staff-very welcoming. Valeria in the restaurant in particular went above and beyond to accommodate our menu choices. She is a star asset to the hotel. Would definitely stay again if happen to be in Dublin anytime soon,5,2024,05,29
243,Wonderful staff and a great location,"This is our fourth time staying at the Marlin Hotel and once again it did not disappoint. 

The location is perfect for access to stores, restaurants and bars. 
The staff are friendly, helpful and efficient. This was my first stay as a pregnant woman and the front of house staff were amazing. They carried our luggage, provided extra pillows so I could have a comfortable sleep, and even gave us a complimentary late checkout. 
The room is compact but has everything you need to have an enjoyable stay. It was spotless. 

Overall, we had a lovely stay and will be returning!",5,2024,05,28
243,Would stay here again,"Absolutely beautiful hotel, staff are extremely helpful and friendl, breakfast was perfect, dinner was very tasty but maybe a few extra choices on menu, coffe hut in the foyer was excellent too and to be fair for Dublin it was reasonably priced, but 5 stars to the staff they certainly know how to meet, greet and treat their customers",5,2024,05,28
243,Great stay,"Very nice stay, friendly staff. Great Breakfast. Central location. Clean room and very comfortable. Outdoor area where to spend evening drinking and enjoying conversation. No noise over night. Speedy check in check out. Top choice in Dublin!",5,2024,05,27
243,Will managed but light on value for money,"Overall a good experience. Clean, organized, easy check in and very well located.  Staff very attentive and well organized. The Cozy King room is tight with barely enough room to move around for a couple. Room had only one power plug point. Cost seemed high for the room size.",4,2024,05,26
243,Central and cozy in Dublin,"Nice accommodation in Dublin, room is cozy and is very well equipped with everything needed, maybe a bit tiny. Staff is welcoming and very nice, happy to assist and give support. Location is great! 10 mins from everything (Trinity college, Temple bar area, city centre). I was in Dublin to go to the UEL final, I booked a few days before so price was inflated.",5,2024,05,26
243,Great Hotel,"My sister and myself stayed at the hotel for four nights while exploring Dublin. The hotel is positioned in a great place in the centre of Dublin so we did not have to walk far to visit all the tourist attractions.
The hotel itself was brilliant and we both loved it. We booked a suite with a dividing partion for privacy. The food and breakfast was very good and there was so much to eat. The rooms we booked were big and spacious and had all the amenities you would expect to have. 
The staff were all polite and friendly and answered all our questions. 
Would we stay here again, yes.",5,2024,05,26
243,Highly recommend this hotel!,"Excellent hotel with attentive, kind staff. The food and coffee on site were also very good. Our flight was cancelled early Sunday morning and we weren't sure what our status was for the following 24 hours. Ralts was extremely helpful and put our mind at ease. I would definitely recommend this hotel and it was a great location. Far enough away from the busy streets and noise but not too far to walk to anything.",5,2024,05,25
243,Fantastic.,"Ultra clean room, beautiful bathroom which utilised the space well. As many guests have mentioned, the bed is right against the walls, giving a bit of a hostel feel but the bed was really large and comfortable. A lovely, slightly quirky hotel with great communal spaces. We used the bar, which was great. Room wasn’t serviced after night one but was rectified as soon as we told them. Staff were great and genuinely wanted to please. Great location. Highly recommended. Would visit again and recommend to friends.",5,2024,05,24
243,No focus on guests,The bathroom was not really clean. Cash payment for little things like car park are no really welcome and no change available.,2,2024,05,24
243,Fabulous!,"Great experience! Clean, modern, and friendly staff. Located close to St Stephen's Green. The  location is walkable for all of South Dublin.  The breakfast was wonderful each morning, and the cocktails, Guinness and food at the bar were awesome. We would definitely recommend!Thank you!",5,2024,05,23
243,Economy and efficiency and very warm and friendly,"While at first I found the room to be very small, the bed was very comfortable and we did not feel cramped at all. There is a lot at the hotel, bar, restaurant, coffee shops, services, so it is really a fun place. Excellent location, central to all the major attractions in downtown Dublin. Highly recommended.",5,2024,05,22
243,A super place to stay,"Excellent hotel. Beautifully decorated and the rooms although cosy were adequate for a couple on a short stay.

Staff were very attentive and helpful. 

The hotel is not in the city centre but sits just three minutes walk from Stephens Green. Where there are buses ,trams and sight seeing buses. 

We wouldn't hesitate to return.",5,2024,05,22
243,Wonderful stay,"The Marlin was in a great location near many attractions.  Very clean and modern furnishings.  The manager, Ralts, went above and beyond our expectations when our flight was canceled and we had to extend our stay.  All staff was very attentive and accommodating.  Restaurant had excellent food and service.  It’s a great value for this level of accommodation and location.  We would stay again.",5,2024,05,21
243,"Charming, modern hotel in the center of Dublin!","Wonderful and charming hotel located centrally in Dublin. You are walking distance to the major sites. So many good restaurants and pubs around. The hotel itself is really modern, has a really cool vibe. The rooms are a little small but it fit us as a couple perfectly. Good Irish breakfast that is worth the money. Ralfs at the Front Desk was exceptional. Great customer service! Ralfs gave us great tips and took care of us while we stayed here. Highly recommend!",5,2024,05,20
243,Pleasant stay,"Very good location few steps away from bars, restaurants, shopping mall and St. Stephen’s park. Also easy access to public transport. Very good welcome at the reception and appreciated the staff friendliness. Very good breakfast.  Recommendable.",4,2024,05,19
243,Absolutely no complaints,"Hotel is perfectly placed for the Grafton Street area, takes less than 2 mins and walkable to Temple Bar, about 10min.  Situated in a Quiet side street, hotel entrance is great, quirky and smells absolutely amazing.   We booked a deluxe room as reviews had said the standard rooms are small.  We were put in an accessible room so the bathroom was huge, gleaming and immaculately clean.  Bedroom was large, well equipped and spotless. If i really had to find fault , maybe the tiny window but it honestly didn’t bother us for a couple of nights.  
We looked at the snug rooms whilst there which are very small but totally functional and actually quite quirky.  Wouldn’t hesitate to book one in the future if only there for a few days. 
Nice toiletries and free bottled water each day. Staff all very helpful.  Can’t recommend this hotel enough. We were very pleased with our choice.",5,2024,05,19
243,Great clean hotel,"Great central hotel with a good breakfast selection. Good shower. The standard rooms are a little cosy but the exec rooms are spacious. Choose according to budget. 

Well worth a trip to local pub the hairy lemon or the long hall before heading to typical temple bar.",5,2024,05,18
243,I am So Grateful,"On the last day of my stay my wallet was stolen. All my credit cards, my passport, cash, gone. 

Stuart and Sean were incredibly helpful and caring, helping me navigate the police reports, getting my room booked for an extra night (I got a relative in the states to book it on his card), helping my find a currency exchange to change someone of the US dollars I still had in my room into Euros. Stuart even offered to go to the ATM and take out Euros for me until I could get money exchanged. They helped me figure out how to get a temporary passport (which I ended up not needing - a  kind person found my wallet with everything except cash and cards still there and got it back to me).

What amazing people! And customer service above and beyond what anyone could expect. 

As for the hotel itself, the location is incredibly convenient - a five to ten minute walk to many of the top things to do and see. My room was small, but the bed was huge! It took up almost half the room. And so comfortable, with lots of comfy pillows. There were ample plugs and USB ports. - even an HDMI port. Drawers under the bed had ample room for my things, and there was also some closed space. The  bathroom was well stocked, great water pressure and big absorbing towels. Everything was spotlessly clean. The huge windows had a light emitting shade as well as a blackout shade, both electrically controlled. 

The hotel itself feels modern and comfortable. Check-in was painlessly easy",5,2024,05,16
243,Excellent location and excellent hotel.,"The location for Marlin Dublin is excellent. Walking distance to downtown and the park. Park is great. Easy public transportation nearby. Room is very clean. Staff is very friendly. It comes with a guess using laundry room, although the dryer doesn't work very well. Overall it is a good place to stay.",5,2024,05,16
243,Great location ,"We enjoyed our two night stay at the Marlin. The location was an easy walk to many of the sites in Dublin. Early check-in for a fee was offered, and it was appreciated after a long flight. Well worth the extra expense. A parking garage across the street with a discounted price from the hotel made it practical to rent a car at the airport. That saved us a lot of time on the day we left Dublin to explore the rest of the country. ",5,2024,05,16
243,Fantastic staff and facilities.,"The Marlin staff were extremely professional, friendly, and accommodating. Each staff member conducting themselves to 5 star standards and the facilities were top notch. The cozy king actually felt more spacious than anticipated, the only thing I might have liked was more space to hang clothes, but I knew what I was getting when I booked the room. The eclectic decor, ample common area seating, espresso station, and  stylish bar area ensure all your needs are covered. I would have no problem recommending the Marlin to anyone for any purpose.",5,2024,05,15
243,Marlin for the win!,"Fantastic stay at the Marlin. Seemless checkin. Staff were friendly. Room was clean, and bed was very comfortable. I opted for the breakfast daily. Excellent selection!  Location is great. Just around the corner from Grafton street, but nestled almost on a back street, so its quiet without all the late night rif-raf. Will be staying here again when i come next year!",5,2024,05,15
243,A pleasant stay in the heart of Dublin,"Our stay at the Marlin Hotel was truly delightful. The hotel boasts a very privileged central location, allowing easy access to Dublin's main attractions. Upon arrival, the check-in reception was very friendly, and the room assigned to us was extremely functional and comfortable. We appreciated the very comfortable bed, the spacious shower, and the excellent temperature control system. One of our favorite moments was enjoying a walk in St. Stephen's Green, just a short walk from the hotel. I will definitely recommend the Marlin Hotel to my friends and acquaintances who plan to visit Dublin.",5,2024,05,14
243,Amazing location and super comfortable beds!!,"Amazing location!! 
Staff was nice, bed was super comfortable and king size! The room was a bit small but we didn’t spend much time in there. Facilties are great! 

Even got some dessert for our honeymoon!

Check out the Thomas Moore pub it’s the best in town and only 2 mins away from the hotel! And Guinness tour is the best out there :)",4,2024,05,13
243,A very good place in the heart of Dublin,"Very confortable hotel,  a warm welcome, the parking just beside.  Very clean room, well equiped. It was our second stay at this hotel and we recommend it also for the location, heart of the city, but in a quiet street. The team is very friendly and ready to hello.",5,2024,05,12
243,Great experience,The hotel was in a great location not in the center of Dublin but close enough so you won't be constantly in the fuzz of the tourists. The room was very comfortable and the king size bed was just perfect. The lobby and the public areas of the hotel were perfectly decorated.,5,2024,05,12
243,I would stay here again,Great location for shopping and catching our tour.   Staff friendly and helpful.  Ana met us at the door and took my suitcase from me and helped with our checkin.  Very much appreciated at the end of a long day.  The breakfast was great and dinner also good.   Having laundry facilities for free was a perk you rarely get and was very much appreciated.,5,2024,05,11
243,Perfect city break,"Warm welcome, clean and quirky decoration. Loved the coffee shop in reception.
The beds/pillows are the most comfortable  especially after a good look around the city and evening drinks. 
Yes there were homeless, yes there were drugs exchanging hands but to be honest...no more than you see in other cities. We did not feel unsafe.
Central to both Grafton street and a short walk to temple bar, thoroughly enjoyed our stay, thank you.",5,2024,05,11
243,"Hotel was nice, only one issue.","We chose this hotel for laundry facilities, to find out they were in disrepair, only one dryer was partially functional. We had to wait for other guests to do their laundry through that one dryer, so hours to get a few clothes clean, doing laundry till 1AM. One unit had a sign reading it was out of order, the other simply did not work (no heat) and the third got warm at best. So overall hotel and staff was nice, but they need to stay on top of maintenance.",3,2024,05,10
243,Great Hotel!!,Lovely hotel and the staff were very friendly. Our expectations were more than met and we were pleasantly suprised with what the hotel had to offer. The bedroom was fresh and modern and we couldn’t have asked for more. Would highly recommend to anymore to stay here as also I’m a great location.,5,2024,05,10
243,Not a safe place,"The hotel is located next door to a social housing area where you witness drugs being used and transferred both day and night. If I had known that, I would never have booked. The room was so small, the window could not be opened and there were hair both around the bed and in the shower. When calling the reception the phone fell out from the wall. Expensive.
Looks new or newly renovated. The lobby area are is ok, so is breakfast. The restaurant not (bad food, expensive). The location is ok as long as you only move towards the very city center and if you don't mind living in a place with a lot of criminality.",1,2024,05,10
243,Marlin Dublin Great Experience,"Warm personal, highly professional, well placed hotel in the heart of Dublin, very cosy room, gorgeous breakfast, the perfect stay !
Very close to St Stephen’s 
Enjoy your journey in Dublin, take the time for its parcs, learn its history, finish your day in a pub listening to music and sharing with Irish people. Brilliant !",5,2024,05,09
243,Superb business stay,"Excellent location, facilities were perfect for group work, plenty of space inside and outside to meet and work.
Food and drink were great and room facilities perfect with desk, power points for charging etc. Built in 2019 but feels brand new. Staff first class, throughout, friendly and helpful. The self check in is great, no queues, easy to use and pops out your room card key and receipt. No room number on the card key for added security is a good idea, the number is clearly printed on your receipt. We are already planning the next meeting and will use this hotel for sure.",5,2024,05,09
243,GREAT experience!!,We had a very enjoyable stay at Marlin Hotel in Dublin - super clean and comfortable! Will certainly stay here again if we ever visit the country again!,5,2024,05,07
243,The perfect city break- great location and rooms!,"Fantastic location in the centre of Dublin, you can easily walk to the main landmarks (St Patrick’s, St Stephen’s Green, Trinity College and Guinness Storehouse) and you’re surrounded by great bars and restaurants- Bambino for great pizza, Temple Bar only a short walk etc... The Guinness Storehouse is a must and we enjoyed a lovely dinner just across the river at the Fish Shop, which is a wine bar that serves fish and chips. The best Guinness we had was by far the Gravediggers pub in the north of the city next to Glasnevin Cemetery- would highly recommend the cemetery tour too as it delves into the fascinating history of Ireland and the many famous people laid the rest there. For the hotel they had lovely and comfortable rooms - would recommend for the perfect city break stay.",5,2024,05,07
243,Excellent from start to finish!,"Eight of us stayed for a special occasion last Saturday night. The staff at the hotel could not have been friendlier, nicer and more gorgeous or more accommodating. I also witness a very difficult rude guest. The staff dealt with him with professionalism and grace. We met with a large group of friends in the bar for drinks and everyone there was also just lovely. Special mention the Sharon who was kind, funny and all sound brilliant. The rooms were perfect. The service was excellent. We would all recommend. Thanks so much for everything :)",5,2024,05,07
243,Amazing stay in Marlin,"Marlin hotel is a hidden gem in the heart of Dublin. Jason was exceptional in helping us with the checking kiosk and his staff were amazing as well. We loved our room. Everything was clear and spotless. Our room was prepared by Larisa, we got a lovely card from her. What a lovely gesture! We'll be back. P&M",5,2024,05,06
243,Quality 10/10,"Easily accessible, very polite staff, food was exceptional and the room was prestine. The car park across the road was very handy and having the ticket validated at reception saved us some money. Second time staying and I'm sure I'll continue to stay here whenever I am in Dublin.",5,2024,05,06
243,Great hotel,"Great hotel. Room was lovely, comfy bed. Great bar/restaurant, we didn’t have food but the drinks were a reasonable price.
Perfect location, close to Grafton Street and Temple Bar.
Only downside we found was that the window sill in the bedroom was not clean - crumbs and hairs.",5,2024,05,06
243,Rooms are small but nice,"We stayed here for one night and our room was spotless clean. The receptionists were excellent and made check in and checking out very easy. The bar, foyer and little outdoor patio are beside the bar worked very well. The bed was firm and comfortable and we choose “Cosy Room” -please be advised the bed touches three walls so you and your partner enter and egress from one end of the bad. This room is very small and the cleverly designed bathroom is tiny. But everything works very well. The staff are excellent and well trained.",4,2024,05,06
243,Excellent central Dublin accommodation.,"We were staying just one night for a family party in central Dublin. The location of the hotel was excellent, right in the heart of things. We had a ‘cosy’ room which, for a short stay, was quite adequate with an ingenious space saving layout. Modern, clean with high quality fittings. Perfect for our needs and we should certainly use it again as long as we can afford Dublin prices, which are worse than central London!",5,2024,05,06
243,Perfect for a Getaway in Dublin,"Very reasonable price for a city centre location.  Excellent location for catching a show or play, shopping and visiting attractions.  Rooms are clean and modern.  Beds are comfortable.  Bar is very nice with excellent service.  All staff were very friendly, helpful and welcoming.  Will definitely come again.",5,2024,05,04
243,"Fulfilling experience @ Marlin Hotel, Dublin","Very friendly and polite staff who are willing to help 
The Cozy King room, though not spacious enough, is clean.
The bathroom is clean with bath supplies 
The breakfast was very good, full English breakfast.
I enjoyed my 8days stay at Marlin and would love to be their guest again any time I visit Dublin
Highly recommended for others",5,2024,05,04
243,Nice stay in Dublin,"The hotel is located close to St. Stephen's Green which was practical for us. The room was spacious, quiet and clean. The bed was big and very comfortable.
There are a coule of things missing, like a place to hang towels in the bathroom and some amenities like a kettle, tea/coffee. But overall it was a nice stay. I can recommend the hotel for a short stay in Dublin.",4,2024,05,04
243,Fresh Happy Place,"This was a very neat hotel. Very modern, new, clean. Easy checkin. For a compact room hotel, it had just what I needed for a quick overnight stay. I recommend it.

It location is great with walking access to Grafton Stree, St. Patrick's cathedral, Temple bar, and many more great locations. Will definitely stay here again! The staff were both friendly and very helpful as well.",5,2024,05,03
243,"Excellent hotel, lovely staff, lovely breakfast and great location.","Had a fabulous time in Dublin, people were so friendly and the music pubs awesome. Hotel was great, both in terms of the location and the service, would definitely return. One small thing was that the bed was so wide it went from wall to wall, so you had to clamber up from the bottom to get up to the pillow. Although I'm 77 it wasn't really an issue for me, but for someone of limited mobility, it would be a problem, and there was no warning given prior to arrival. Lovely helpful staff too.",5,2024,05,02
243,One night stay,"Love a square bed, it was super comfy and we had a great night's sleep. The staff were very friendly and helpful. Would highly recommend staying here.",5,2024,05,02
243,A marvellous second stay in the heart of Dublin,"This is our second stay at the hotel. The first one was during the pandemic period in November 2021. The personnel of the Marlin Hotel gave us such a warm welcome, despite the social distancing rules in the pandemic, that we didn't hesitate to choose this hotel again for our 2024 visit with our friends. 
The staff at Marlin really represents the beautiful Irish people's hospitality.

The welcoming service of this hotel has fortunately not changed. Our friend had some issues with his prosthetic knee during our stay, and the hotel promptly provided him with a wheelchair that he could use during our 4-day stay. 

The staff helped us with all our requests professionally, and always with lots of smiles! One lady at the front desk, Lisa, made us really feel welcome and that we couldn't ask her too much. 

The staff at the dining room also did an outstanding job at providing the guests with the best service. The service was prompt and friendly, and the breakfast dishes were always re-filled until the last guest had the breakfast. The breakfast was also superb: you can have full Irish breakfast,, porridge, fresh fruits, continental breakfast, pastries,... 

We were so happy to be able to say hello again to Sharon, the lovely lady who spoilt us with her cheerful and warm greetings every morning at the breakfast in 2021! She also remembered us, so it felt like saying hello to a friend. 

The location of this hotel is superb: very central, close to everything (shops, highlights, transport, pubs, restaurants,...), yet is very quiet. You can reach the hotel by bus from the airport (bus 16, and takes around 1 hour. The bus stops around 200 m from the hotel), or by a cab (45 minutes, and costs around 35 EUR). 

The bed is very huge and comfortable, though the standard room is a bit too small to stay for a longer time than a long weekend (we had the room 258). We also missed some additional hangers for towels in the bathroom, and a fridge to cool some things.

As we said to the staff at leaving, we won't say goodbye but see you again!!! We left a piece of our hearts in the beautiful Ireland, so will certainly come to visit again.",5,2024,05,01
243,Great place but too expensive.,"Marlin hotel in great location,staff amazing ,room clean tidy couldn't fault.

we been coming to this hotel for past five years normally stay January time but this year wr had to change dates. 

we did have a great time.Only negative  opinion is why is it 179 per person in April when January it was only 149 per person? for the exact same service and room???

plus, why is the price significantly higher for next week? I've checked a few dates, and some prices are nearly €300 plus per person again for the exact same room and service  as we got.

I understand inflation, but some of these prices are ridiculous, sorry.

unfortunately, this will be the last time we will be back , Dublin hotel prices are too expensive, plus it's cheaper to book a holiday aboard for the same price for the week in the sun.

if you don't mind paying these  high prices, I highly recommend this hotel as I've stated the only negative is the price, sorry.

hopefully, some year, the prices can be decreased.

243,Nice central hotel,"The room was nicely furnished & comfortable. Good service at the bar in the evenings & nice atmosphere all round the hotel in general. 
Well located for walking to most tourist attractions too.
We didn't have breakfast or dinner so can't comment on them.",5,2024,04,24
243,Bed / NO Breakfasts,"I booked 4 rooms. 3 rooms had breakfast included. 
We agreed at check in we would take the breakfast take away as we were leaving @7am the next morning. This is what the staff agreed with me at check in. Too good to be true I suppose!!!
Nothing organised. 
When we asked all we got was a blank response. We had already paid for the rooms. Won’t make that mistake again!!

Very disappointing since the hotel was amazing 

Ended up stopping at a service station for coffee. Paid good money for bed and breakfast. Not good value at all. 
Spent a small fortune in the bar as the 3 additional rooms were for customers. 
Sorry I did now.

Location was brilliant with the luas just a minutes walk away which brings you straight to the 3Arena. The rooms were extremely comfortable and clean. The hotel is surrounded with bars and restaurants making it a brilliant location. The staff couldn’t have been friendlier. I would definitely recommend staying here and will certainly be back !,5,2024,04,23
243,"Super clean, comfortable, and convenient!!!","Super clean, comfortable, and convenient!!! We just got back yesterday from staying at the Marlin, and the hotel was exactly what we were looking for in Dublin! The location was perfect to easily walk to St. Stephen's Green, Temple Bar area, and lots of nearby shops/pubs. The hotel was very clean and modern with contemporary decor throughout. The room was small (which we totally expected when we booked), but it was laid out very nicely with a huge pull-out storage drawer beneath the bed to hold our luggage so we really felt like we had plenty of room! Plus, the bed was very comfortable! We were especially impressed with all the amenities available at the hotel! We especially enjoyed the large lovely dining area (including indoor and patio seating) for breakfast each morning, and when we were exhausted from a day of traveling, we enjoyed being able to have a nice dinner and drinks in the evening right at the hotel. There was even a convenient little coffee shop in the lobby to grab a quick drink/snack on our way out to see the city. The free photo booth in the lobby was a fun touch too! (Other amenities offered that we didn't use included guest laundry and a gym.) The staff was very friendly, and Lisa at the front desk was especially helpful to us and accommodated our late check out request! We highly recommend staying at The Marlin!",5,2024,04,23
243,Excellent Hotel! Amazing Beds...,"Wonderful Hotel! So central and clean. The beds are the most comfortable in the whole city! Beautiful breakfast and very stylish comfortable interiors! Quiet and pleasant.  Thanks to Jason always a pleasure to stay at your wonderful hotel.  We will be back! 
Karen and Kim!",5,2024,04,23
243,Just what you need and in the centre of everything,"Hotel was lovely and clean when walking into the lobby and all within close proximity of the centre! I also contacted the hotel upon booking to ask if they could do something small as it was my partners 30th birthday not expecting them to in all honesty as I had t followed it up but they did supply a small dessert with happy birthday on, was a lovely little touch. Would definitely return and recommend this hotel for tourists and locals alike",5,2024,04,23
243,Amazing location and friendly staff,"Our first stop in Ireland and this hotel's location is the best! It is walking distance to all the top attractions and Temple Bar area, we had so many restaurants nearby. The in-house coffee truck was convenient but more importantly delicious. Ana at the Front Desk was incredibly friendly and helpful. We had an overnight flight and came for my birthday trip and her service was really great.",5,2024,04,22
243,"Location, Quality, Friendliness!","A wonderful stay. Perfect location, excellent facilities, very friendly staff. Highly recommended hotel.",5,2024,04,21
243,Overall good - upgrade room if you can,"Good points - hotel is spotless, and downstairs area, bar restaurant and coffee box are modern and lovely looking. 
Staff were very helpful though almost all check in is done by a computer , there is someone there to help if you have a problem (I didn’t ) - staff were helpful in getting me a plaster for sore feet one morning when I asked! And breakfast and food were all nice. 
Location is very handy for Dublin City centre sights and easy to get to from the Aircoach transfer bus I took . Check out was very easy and communication before I arrived was strong. Lots of tourist information in foyer. Staff happy to help with taxis etc 
Areas for improvement - for 4 star I felt my room (112) was very small, looked directly out onto a large block of residential flats which often had people out on balcony so I felt I had to have blinds and curtains shut all the time for privacy. The bed is huge and so much so it is wall to wall. It’s like a giant soft marshmallow!  I could have upgraded before I went but for the price I felt the room was a bit poky and there was a smell of flowery disinfectant everywhere - I basically felt a bit claustrophobic  and didn’t enjoy being in the room. 
There is no kettle in the room nor any complimentary teas or coffees - this is a big miss for me, I want a coffee in bed /in my room first thing and having to go down for breakfast first to get a coffee  is not the same - no room service either. Again for 4 star not what I was expecting. I’d I’d stayed any longer I’d have bought a wee travel kettle ! (But that’s just me)",3,2024,04,20
243,A great stay at the Marlin. Excellent service and the staff were marvellous. Thank you all,"Great breakfast, all tastes catered for. The bedroom was clean and comfortable.

Parking is also very close and easy to manage payment.

 Great breakfast as well - would definitely revisit in the future.",5,2024,04,14
243,Friendly staff but rooms much too small for the price,"Very friendly staff and great location but take care when booking as the so called King Size rooms are extremely small less that 14sq mt this makes longer stays very difficult as there are only 3 hangers and one small draw for clothes storage 
It’s a little misleading to call it a King Size room and there are better options around that location",3,2024,04,14
243,Excellent customer service.,"The staff at the hotel were so helpful and accommodating. Large, clean room with comfortable bed. Location is perfect for exploring the city.

243,Great short stay,"Lovely hotel with very nice staff. Fantastic location, pleasant interior design and a very smart bedroom for a one night stay. Super comfortable bed. L'ocittane washing mini products in the bathroom, in my favourite verbena variety, so that was a nice surprise. Amazing range of breakfast options with proper coffee, all cooked well (not easy to serve hash browns and sausages in the food warmers but they managed to keep them just right) and served in a beautiful room which made all food look extra appetising. We will stay again.",5,2024,04,07

243,A trip we will NEVER forget and one of our best by far!,"We stayed here for 4 nights in March, 2024.

Jason and the front of the house were absolutely amazing and so accommodating for all our needs. They went above & beyond to make sure our trip was a relaxing/yet memorable one. Each day we would leave after breakfast & come back letter in the afternoon or evening and they wanted to hear about what we did & if it was enjoyable. The hotel is SPOTLESS, in the best location for either walking, taking a taxi or bus, no need for a car actually. The breakfast buffet was superb and I highly recommend getting it each day you are there. The food all together at Marlin is excellent and the dining staff were just as amazing. 

We were sad to leave but reassured Jason that we WILL BE BACK & we have told our friends and family about this gorgeous hotel.",5,2024,04,03

The rooms were very clean and had everything you would need for a short stay. The hotel itself is in a great location within walking distance of main points in the city. We included breakfast in our stay too which had a variety of great options! Thanks so much to everyone at the Marlin, we hope to come back soon!",5,2024,03,25

243,Interesting,"Booked this stay late on the Ire v Scot rugby weekend plus it was St. Patrick’s weekend, so keep in context.
Booked a cosy king room, pretty much €1000 for 2 nights and the room doesn’t come with a wardrobe, 3 hangers on the wall and no tea and coffee facilities, had to ask for them. Just thought it was a bit steep for a very limited room, and didn’t see the no wardrobe anywhere on the website!",3,2024,03,21
243,Solo comfort,"Friendly and knowledgeable staff, especially Elvira. The room was comfortable and very clean. Great size for a solo traveler. The hotel will also store your luggage if you arrive earlier than the check-in time of 3 pm. Same applies for checkout time. This was a great convenience for me. ",5,2024,03,21

243,Would Return,"We just dropped in here for something to eat & a drink. Prices (as in all places lately) had increased but it was not as expensive as some.

243,Immaculate vibes,So cozy and cute! Loved the bed and the staff were very helpful and friendly. The room was modern and had all the essentials. Lovely towels. TV was nice but hard to navigate. Lovely shower. Cool workspace downstairs and very nice bar and restaurant.,5,2024,03,20
243,Great experience but could be better,"The bed is very comfy, rooms are nice and bright although the windows cannot be opened but there's a split in the room that helps with air recirculation. Cleaning could be a little bit improved and also less confusion about breakfast price would be appreciated given that we were charged different prices (we were a group of 14).
Overall it's a very nice hotel and with a few amends it can be at the top level.",4,2024,03,19

243,The Great Marlin stay,"One of the best hotel experiences I have had in a while. From the bar to the cleaning staff. Everyone is kind, respectful and attentive to the needs of the guests. 

If you dine at the restaurant the food is great and the café bar in the morning is wonderful as well. 

It doesn’t hurt that the hotel is centered minutes away from other attractions as well, from nightlife to shopping.",5,2024,03,14
243,Great location and a wonderful nights sleep,"The hotel is just off St Stephen’s Green Shopping centre and around the corner from Gaiety Theatre. It was a work trip so I needed to have a quiet room, I stayed on the 5th floor and it was very quiet all night..The cosy kingsize room is small but the bed is very large you could sleep 3 people in it. Walk in shower and toiletries in the room. Also had 2 bottles of water, still and sparkling. The price was very reasonable. I had dinner in the restaurant which was a double burger and fries and it was very tasty and good value. ",5,2024,03,14
243,A great place to stay,"The Marlin Hotel excels with its exceptionally friendly staff, streamlined check-in process, and comfortable, well-appointed rooms that promise a restful stay.

Its so hard to her good service these days, this hotel really exceeded my expectations! Worth the money! The breakfast was delicious and plentiful at the buffet.

243,Parking Rip Off,"Git ripped off on parking charges- hotel validate your ticket and you’re supposed to get a discount, instead they do their own pricing not based on your hours in car park but number of days even if its less than a full day. Beware! Im trying to get refund and will post. If you going Q Parks own website its way  cheaper to book parking.",1,2024,03,02
243,Love it - will be back!!!,"This is my favorite hotel in Dublin.  Been here many times.  Great price and excellent location.  Beautiful lobby and Sean and Stuart at the front desk are excellent.

243,Short but great stay!!,"Our travel plans only had us here for a single night, but what a great experience!! We began with Ana at the front desk making sure we were set up with everything first time Ireland visitors would need from The Marlin.  Our room was neat, clean and very comfortable!! Auto parking was accomplished by using the garage across the road with a validation from The Marlin.  We dined at the bar/restaurant and had a very good meal.  Breakfast....what a treat!!  Wide range of options in a buffet setting!",5,2024,03,01

243,Good experience,Everything was good. Big bed and toilet. Everything clean. The only thing was we could clearly hear other people's noises at 5am but I guess they had their window open. That was the only inconvenient. It was a lovely hotel I would go back in the future.,5,2024,02,28
243,Good Engaging Staff,"Had a really good experience with Stuart, at front desk, and the guys in the restaurant. Not sure why we are expected to pay for early check-in, when the room is already ready, but I suppose that's a means of generating some additional revenue. Anyway, happy to go back to the Marlin again.",4,2024,02,28
243,"""Book it.. you wont be disappointed""","Our stay in The Marlin was fab, From the moment we walked through the doors we were made feel so welcome .

The staff in The Marlin are friendly, helpful and professional. We will definitely be recommending and choosing The Marlin for our future stays in Dublin.",5,2024,02,28

Food if you fancy, a drink with friends or solo, space to chill, work or chat. A hop, skip & a jump from good eateries, bars or shopping. 
",4,2024,02,28
243,"Welcoming hotel, clean and comfortable","Working in the area, this hotel was selected mostly for its location. The hotel is very pleasing and stylish to look at from the moment you enter.

Check-in was super simple on a touchscreen, and a member of staff was available to assist at all times if you need it.

The room itself was very comfortable, with adequate features that appealed to me such as the casting of your own phone content (music video etc) to the TV and audio to the bathroom. Whilst I didn't feel like I needed it, the lack of a kettle and complementary hot drinks may not be for everyone. You do however get complimentary water. As a side note, they have a very nice coffee bar inside the hotel near the entrance, which is about mid-priced for the area.

The bar staff were very polite and to my surprise the pricing was also mid-priced compared to some of the bars in town. I didn't dine here though so I can't comment on the food.

A special mention goes to Victoria who was very friendly on the check-in desk and always available to help whenever needed. She arranged my taxi back to the airport too, with a smile.",5,2024,02,26
243,Great hotel,A lovely hotel .. the food is excellent and the staff are fantastic . The rooms a very compact but comfortable. I would definitely recommend this hotel excellent location just minutes walk from St Stephens green and Grafton Street. Great value,5,2024,02,26

243,Great location and cool vibes.,"Great location just behind Stephen’s Green shopping centre. Modern and cool with some quirky touches like Photo Booth in lobby and a coffee pod. Plenty of workspace areas for business travellers. Room was small but adequate and very clean and funky. We had our evening meal in the restaurant which was tasty with cocktails and drinks. All very well  priced and you get a 15% discount voucher in your room to redeem against food & drink. We would rebook. Nice touch on the checking  out when staff member , Elvira , asked us if they could improve the offer in any way. All the staff were very pleasant.",5,2024,02,25

They have this amazing coffee dock in the middle of The Hotel reception.

You are just 2 minutes from Grafton Street which  has great shopping, Trinity College 10 minutes away, Stephen Green, five minutes away , everything is literally just on the doorstep of The Marlin .

I would return.",5,2024,02,20

Rooms are cozy but very comfortable and clean. Just be aware that in the Cozy King room wardrobe space is limited. 
Excellent buffet breakfast is served in the morning and there was always plenty of space.
Another highlight is the staff who are very friendly and professional. My extra thanks go to Anna at the reception who assisted my mother and myself and is an absolute gem.
Look forward to returning back in the not too distant future.",5,2024,02,12
243,Excellent hotel,The Marlin Hotel is an excellent option for business or pleasure. A lovely hotel with excellent staff that are friendly and efficient and a really nice atmosphere right in the centre of Dublin and at prices that are reasonable.

243,"Modern hotel, in the most central location","Stayed at this hotel for the second time after such a great experience 2 years ago, decided to give it a go again, however have mixed feelings about the hotel after this time around. 

Rooms are exactly as I remembered - they give off CitizenM vibes - small & compact, but all the amenities required are there & you cannot fault them.  The bed is the highlight, massive & like sleeping on a cloud!  The Chromecasting capability to the tv is always a great selling point in modernised hotels these days too.  We had a few niggles with our room, the Bluetooth speaker in the bathroom (one of the highlight selling points from my last stay) did not work, which was extremely disappointing.  Plus, on the Sunday, we exited our room at 12:00 hrs, & did not return until after 15:30 hrs & our room still had not been attended to by the housekeeping staff when the “YES” sign for cleaning was displayed on the door.  We had to ask the maid for fresh towels to shower, which she kindly did, but was a slight inconvenience that our room wasn’t cleaned once for the 3 days of our stay. 

The location is perfect, central in St Stephen’s Green, making it perfect for walking distance all areas alike Temple Bar, The Northside & South-West Inner City.  Roughly a 25 minute walk to the Guinness Storehouse which is extremely handy.  All necessary shops are a stone’s throw away too. 

We did not experience breakfast / dinner in the hotel, however the bar was a great atmosphere, with 15% off food & drink for hotel guests, along with a lovely heated seating terrace which was fab & open late.

We were kindly located a higher floor room as requested, & were pleased to find an ice machine built into the wall which was a nifty addition & unique to this hotel too.  The staff were very pleasant when passing them in the hotel (housekeeping & bartenders), & the reception staff were pleasant enough - kudos to the lady who checked us in on 3rd February around 11:30 hrs, she was so kind & welcoming!  The lady upon check-out could’ve been a bit politer, plus we had paid for early check-in & late check-out - experienced a few issues with this.  We were not contacted prior to our arrival to ensure it had been confirmed, & turned up at the hotel on a whim & thankfully, our room was ready to go.  Additionally, at exactly 14:00 hrs, a reception staff member chapped on our door telling us it was time to leave as we were already packed & ready to exit the room.  I found this quite ignorant, & unnecessary as it was not like we were late to check-out - she did not give any explanation to this, or apologies which was slightly strange as I’ve never experienced this in another hotel before…

Unsure if I will return on my next visit to Dublin, nonetheless you cannot beat the cost of the hotel along with the location & it was good to be back.",3,2024,02,05
243,Marlin Hotel Dublin,"Absolutely fantastic hotel for the price. The hotel was situated right in the city centre. The staff were all fabulous.

243,What a find in the centre of Dunlin,"What a gorgeous hotel . The quirky interiors were fabulous. The staff were friendly and very accommodating.

243,Possibly the best and most bang for your buck hotel in Dublin!,"I recently took a trip to Dublin for my 30th birthday. It was my 4th time in Ireland and try as I might to go out and explore other areas I always end up back in Dublin. I used to be a big hostel stayer when traveling in Europe but now that I'm a sophisticated adultier adult I deserve a real hotel. There is no shortage to choose from in Dublin but the minute I saw the location and the pictures of the Marlin I knew it was the place. My first few days I stayed somewhere else and it was great but after days and days of walking and train riding, in and out of the rain, I needed easy and I was pleasantly surprised by the ease that came with check in. I was checked in by Ana, she was wonderful, very personable. I realized after walking into my room, albeit small, this was the nicest hotel I had probably ever stayed in (I got it for a steal too, thank you Capital One reward miles). The bed was huge, comfortable, the textbook definition of a cozy nook. The bathroom was nice and clean. There were many different lighting options, plenty of floor space and storage options and, my favorite part, automatic blinds. One of the nights I went down to the bar area, I had the cheese plate and an espresso martini, they were fantastic, exactly what I needed. I loved the proximity to the St. Stephen's Green Luas stop. And also the fact that Aungier and Grafton st were so walkable. I try to avoid Temple Bar as much as possible and staying at the Marlin put me right smack dab in the middle of the best places to get food and shop without having to deal with that chaos. I am a travel agent and now any time someone wants to stay in Dublin I will 100% be booking this place for them. It has everything you need and puts you exactly where you want to be if you want the best of touristy Dublin and real Dublin. ",5,2023,12,20

243,"Superb location, fantastic hotel, very cost-effective","Loved the Marlin hotel. Anytime I'm in Dublin I'll be sure to stay here. The hotel is in a superb location, so central. It's really funky and cool. I love the self-check-in desk where you easily check-in and collect your keycard. The rooms are compact but they designed really well. There's great use of space, plenty of storage and the bed was so comfortable. Really nice toiletries too! They have a lovely bar downstairs and lots of space if you wanted to work from the lobby. So cost-effective too, which is so rare in Dublin especially for this location being right in St. Stephens Green. Would highly recommend",5,2023,12,20

I was staying in a Cozy King room. Yes the room is small, but the bed is big and comfortable, the bathroom is new and spotless, the room was really clean and cozy, so I refuse to criticize the size.

243,Rooms are spotless. Perfect location. Hightly recommdned.,"Lovely welcome, easy automated check in, friendly staff. Room was spotless. Perfect for a short stay or for work. Didn't use the bar but it looked really cool. The overall atmosphere was really nice and down to earth and on point. The Vespa in the foyer was a nice touch. The price for one night was decent given the shambles of dublin prices (167e) but it was still expensive in terms of what I got for 167e ( a breakfast included would have been nice). I would return without a doubt and would recommend it to anyone on a short stay.",5,2023,12,10
243,"Great location, great staff, great hotel","Lovely room, great staff throughout the hotel. Good price, great location. The food was lovely. There was no kettle provided but if id asked for one they would have provided it. I'll definitely stay here again",5,2023,12,10

243,Basic and bland ,"Basic and bland. Felt like a large caravan or boat cabin. Very strange bed filling the room wall to wall. Have to climb over partner to get in and out. Hard mattress.
No tea/ coffee facilities as standard .No bedside/ night light. Had to use torch to avoid main lights during the night. Bathroom light on motion sensor.
Good air con but cool. We turned up the heat but it mysteriously turned itself down again! Water in Morning not hot enough for shave. 

Good central location with close parking. Friendly staff. Clean. 
Asked for extra pillows and they arrived quickly.
Don't think I'd stay again. Like a cuppa night and morning, a softer mattress and a small light to switch on if getting up during the night.",3,2023,12,06

243,Comes highly recommended,"Amazing room. Initially had a CK booked and upgraded to an executive after arriving at the front desk. Room was very spacious and bed was very comfy, one of the biggest I’ve slept in. Glad I took the upgrade as the initial room was very small I felt. 
The workstations were great as well, very nice atmosphere and vibrant music playing on the ground floor which made it a pleasure to get some work done. Staff very welcoming and friendly, was able to joke around with them too. Would recommend to anyone staying in the town.",5,2023,12,01
243,Great staff very friendly ,Staff were so friendly and helpful. I stayed at the Marlin on a business trip and thought it was perfect.

243,Great stay in tense times,My booking with the Marlin hotel was last moment and very unexpected. Unfortunately I was stuck in Dublin on 23rd November and was advised not to go back to the hotel that I  originally checked into because of the riot situation. Luckily I was able to get a room in the Marlin. The staff was very courteous and I got checked into a room without any hassles. The bed was huge I got a good sleep. The staff even booked a taxi for me the next morning which was very helpful. I will definitely stay in this hotel my next time in Dublin ,5,2023,11,25

The breakfast has a wide choice of food with booth cooked and continental selections.",5,2023,11,25
243,A Break in a Workspace,"Upon entering the Marlin Hotel lobby it quickly becomes apparent that it is a work friendly environment; the workstation is rather inviting with pleasant lighting, soft music and plenty of outlets for all your devices. I am a teacher and had not planned on doing work, but brought my laptop just in case, and as my trip was winding down, I decided to sit there and plan some lessons; it was actually enjoyable and even relaxing--I highly recommend it.",5,2023,11,25

243,Great Price and Location with a Wonderful Helpful Staff,"Great hotel with helpful staff and easy to get to. This was my first time in Dublin and I randomly picked a reasonably priced hotel for my few days here-- I was not disappointed!

I took the bus (784) to Dublin Central and then hoped on the Green line to Stephens Green. From there it was a short walk to the hotel. 

Walking around the area I could easily get to Trinity College and Grafton Street for shopping. I could then walk over to Guinness Storehouse for a tour and see St Patrick's Cathedral and my way over. 

I wasn't entirely sure where I should go or eat but the hotel staff was so kind in making recommendations that I did indeed follow! There's plenty of restaurant options and there is the convenience of eating at the hotel too. 

They do offer early check in for a little extra fee. For me it was worth it after taking an international red eye there. I arrived early morning and could take a nap before heading out for the evening. The room was clean and comfortable. ",5,2023,11,24
243,Wonderful stay in Dublin,"I had a wonderful stay in Dublin at the Marlin hotel. It was steps away from Grafton Street, where all the fabulous shopping is! It was the perfect place to stay at the holidays. Another perk was that it was a five minute walk from temple bar, and a seven minute walk to Sophia‘s rooftop bar, which is the best restaurant in the city.",5,2023,11,24
243,"Great location, quiet comfortable rooms","Excellent hotel. Nice staff. Highly recommend. A great location in Dublin, close to everything. The rooms are small, but clean.

243,Excellent,Myself amd my daughter stayed at the marlin Hotel on Friday night. We were greeted by one of the staff who helped us check in with ease. Asked us what our trip was for and we mentioned a concert in the 3arena  he asked if we needed  taxi to and from there and booked it for us straight away. He was so professional and polite. The rooms are quite small but very cosy and comfortable.  They had the nicest pillows I have ever slept on in my life. I would highly recommend this hotel to family and friends and will definitely return. Keep up the great standards. ,5,2023,11,19
243,Excellent hotel and staff ,Just back from two nights at the Marlin Hotel. The hotel is visually impressive from the outside and this continues inside including the bedrooms. Hotel was well kept and in particular our room and the lobby. The staff couldn't have been more helpful either. I had a small issue with my booking which Luke the manager was able to sort out quickly for me. We only dined for breakfast in the hotel and the quality was good compared to other offers we have tried in the area previously. All in all we will absolutely be back. A special mention to Luke and also to Lisa at the front desk too,5,2023,11,19
243,Excellent stay,"Marlin Hotel is great for couples. Rooms are clean and cozy, excellent customer service from beginning till check out. Great location, close parking, friendly staff. The hotel itself is very modern with a nice restaurant to enjoy a romantic dinner.

Breakfast was help yourself buffet which didn't dissapoint. 
I would definitely stay here again and happily recommend 'The Marlin Hotel' without hesitation. 

",5,2023,11,19
243,Shopping Trip and Overnight Stay,"My wife and I stayed here for one night on a recent shopping trip to Dublin. The hotel check-in staff were extremely efficient,helpful and friendly. We stayed in the Cosy King Room and it was perfect for our needs on this trip, the room was small but the bed was an oversize king and extremely comfortable. We didn't avail of the hotel's dining facilities on this trip so can't comment on. The hotel is very centrally located on Bow Street East, immediately to the rear of Stephens Green Shopping Centre and is perfectly located within minutes of numerous shops ,bars, restaurants, the Gaiety Theatre, Grafton Street and Stephens Green. We have stayed here in the past as it was the perfect choice for us that time also. We can thoroughly recommend this hotel.",5,2023,11,19
243,Fab,"Super impressed. From the ease of check in and the option to self check in with the added quirk of the key card scanning on the lift to take you to your floor without having to even bother looking where you need to go lol. The room was beautifully clean and even though we didn’t need disability facilities, I was loving seeing that everything in the room had everybody in mind and facilities available as that is the way everywhere should be. The vibe of the lobby/sitting area was lovely, definitely a place guests were choosing to spend time.. Everything was faultless really and I would 100% stay again.",5,2023,11,18
243,Flabbergasted by the hospitality they offered!! ,"My husband and I, recently got married and decided to take a 34 day trip around Europe. Ireland was our very last stop, and as you know you’re extremely tired and ready to be home and just want to have the best final experience. The marlin did not disappoint. By far the most hospitable, and nicest staff we’ve worked with on our ENTIRE vacation! They upgraded us for our honeymoon, had a beautiful set up when we checked in! Jason was so accommodating for my husband and I. We had a tour the day we checked out for 15 hours, and he allowed us to use the bag concierge service, even though we were already checked out. They gave us plenty of drinks and water as we made our drive to Kilkenny.  The gentlemen that checked us in was extremely nice. The bedrooms were super clean, and quaint! They accommodated all our needs during our stay. The bar downstairs has great food! Over all just the most hospitable experience! We deff will be staying here again, when we return!! ",5,2023,11,18
243,"Stylish & immaculate, central location to central Dublin","Just been to stay at Marlin Hotel Dublin, very stylish and immaculate with comfortable bedroom.

243,Best Hotel in Dublin City,"Perfect hotel when you want to stay in the centre of Dublin. By far the cheapest hotel in the centre of the city (still expensive but that's Dublin). 
The staff were very friendly at the front desk, helping to get us checked in. The man at reception also gave us some great advice on local pubs and restaurants that would give us a genuine Dublin experience. The staff in the restaurant were very chatty and helpful as well, creating a great atmosphere.
The rooms were on the smaller side but for the price it was perfect.
Will definitely stay again when back in Dublin",5,2023,11,15
243,Perfect Stay in Central Dublin,"Stayed at the Marlin Hotel for 2 nights and couldn't recommend it enough. The staff at the front desk were so helpful and welcoming when I was checking in, and I was in my room within 5 minutes of entering through the doors having used the self-check in. This meant within 10 minutes of parking my car in the car park I was already checked in and walking down Grafton Street.
The bed was one of the comfiest I've ever slept in, having a large 2mx2m mattress. I also opted to eat at the hotel's bar and restaurant, where the burger was one of the best I've ever had. Cannot commend the staff highly enough who were conversational and friendly making me feel very welcome at the hotel.",5,2023,11,15
243,Very enjoyable stay,"Visited Dublin for the night and stayed at the Marlin which I booked via hotels.com. Plenty of info on website and parked at Q Park opposite (when we checked out we paid 24 or 25 euros which was the hotel rate and stayed the full 24 hours - we arrived at 5 the previous day, checked out at 11 and then left the car park at 430).
The room was good, cosy but with a comfortable bed (view of office building opposite but you get the automated blinds to block them out) and I don't recall much city noise.
Staff were very helpful, advising us on how to get to places and holding on to our luggage.
Would definitely visit again.
The only thing (and this is not the hotel's fault) is that traffic getting into and out of Dublin is very very slow - much quicker to get transit from airport rather than driving!",5,2023,11,14
243,Great modern hotel in a good location,"EXcellent modern style hotel tucked away close to St Stephen's Green with all nearby shops and restaurants. Friendly and helpful staff always on hand, good clean stylish bedrooms with good facilities (maybe a fridge?) . Overall a fantastic base for any visit to Dublin",5,2023,11,10
243,10/10,Very helpful and friendly staff. Would definitely recommend anyone to stay here. Great location. 15 minute walk to jervis to get luas but took me about 12 mins as I walk quite fast. I'd definitely stay here again and recommend it to others,5,2023,11,09
243,Great location.,Very ideally located in Dublin City. Good parking facilities and comfortable rooms. However people were knocking on the door in the early hours as they came back after a night out. Nothing staff could do about that. Staff were excellent in all other aspects of our stay. Couldn’t so enough for you. Would recommend. ,5,2023,11,06
243,Could be better,"Hotel looks very nice, also the staff working on reception is very polite. It is on amazing Location, in the Centre of the city, you can easily reach all turistic sites by walking. Experience would be much better if the room was cleaner. There were  Dirty spots next to the window and bathroom shower was not clean.",3,2023,11,05
243,Very Nice Hotel in a Perfect Location ,"Stayed in a Cosy King room. The bed was extremely comfortable and the bathroom well appointed.  Impeccably clean. The staff were very friendly and helpful. The public spaces offer lots of choices to relax. The food in the bar was good, as were the drinks. ",5,2023,10,31
243,"The good, the bad and the ugly","The Good…
We spent four nights here with two rooms. The hotel is pretty new and in an excellent location where you can easily walk to St Stephen’s Green, Grafton street and the River Liffey. The service and food at the bar and restaurant is very good. 
The Bad…
The rooms were tiny with no closet ( just 3 hangers on the wall) no coffee making equipment, a half door on the shower that led to water on the floor, a bathroom door that didn’t close properly. It was never cleaned well either. We were never left clean glasses and had to ask for them, when someone would answer our call! We were left with no toilet paper or tissues one day plus our wet bath mat was rolled up neatly and put back in the shower. 
The Ugly…
On our last afternoon, we arrived back at our room with about an hour until we had to leave for dinner. When I went to start some packing, I found my hairbrush in the bathroom full of long black hair! I have short grey hair as does the person I was sharing with. I called to the front desk and someone came up immediately. They were as appalled and disgusted as I was. Since we were leaving the next morning at 6:30 he said he would contact me about the investigation. Several days later I contacted the hotel since I hadn’t heard anything. I’ve never been told if they figured out who did this, they claim it is an internal investigation. My privacy and belongings were violated, I think I deserve being told. After being offered a free room upgrade and dinner if I ever returned which I refused, I was then offered 75 euros. They claimed that was all they could offer but then my credit card was refunded the full amount. 
My advice if you have to stay here is lock up your bathroom toiletries!",2,2023,10,31
243,Cozy king,No we're to hang clothes  and no kettle  to make tea plus  front desk was rude when u rang to ask a simple  question  also no menu in the room to order room service  plus the bed wasn't  made also your partner  has to cross u to go to the bathroom  as the bed is pushed  up to a window ,3,2023,10,30
243,Great location but don't stay for longer than one night,"This hotel is obviously in an area that Dublin are trying to regenerate.. It is relatively new, in a good location. However, although the bar staff were fantastic  (albeit, menu not extensive), the self check in/out is soleless; our room was so small that if I needed to use the bathroom once in bed, I had to clamber over my partner to get there, i.e. only one way in; the room door latch was broken; bits of the broken electrics were stuck together with duct tape; the room also looked like it hadn't been properly cleaned.... bits of what appeared to be airline baggage stickers  were stuck to the bathroom wall! Considering the cost... this was all very, very disappointing. Make it more welcoming.... ",3,2023,10,30
243,"Great hotel, good sleep","I slept very well here because the beds were comfortable, the room quiet, sound insulation good, and (this applies to me personally but may well apply to others as well) the room, as measured by my electrical field meters, was very low in electrical fields. I am electrically sensitive and many hotel rooms are a nightmare for me to sleep in as they are so 'lively' electrically, but the builders of this hotel have done a great job in shielding wiring, etc. I have no idea if this was deliberate or accidental but I am grateful for it. 

Two things that could be improved: rooms should be supplied with a kettle for making tea etc, and someone should clean behind the TV, which had the dust of ages stuck to it. Rest of the room was very clean.

Couples who share a bed may be annoyed by the fact that the tight room layout means one person has to climb over the other to get out of the bed, but as I was not sharing my room this did not affect me.",5,2023,10,30
243,Great place to stay,"We had a wonderful stay at this hotel. Staff are lovely & helpful, hotel is spotlessly clean & the food in the restaurant food is scrumptious. Location was great walking distance to everything. Cannot wait to stay here again!",5,2023,10,29

243,Great city stay,"I loved this hotel. The staff were so friendly and helpful from start to finish. It was so clean and comfy and had everything you could need for a city break. It was a great location in the city centre. Can’t think of a single fault - apart from not enough pillows on the bed but when I asked for more they were left for me immediately. The bathroom had a very nice feature that it streamed the sound from the tv into the bathroom from a speaker, loved it. Was so nice to come in from a day of endless walking to a huge cosy bed and watch some TV. Didn’t even have to get up to open the blinds as there was a switch to do it beside the bed. Amazing! Will definitely stay here again if I visit Dublin again. Thank you for a brilliant stay!",5,2023,10,26
243,My new favourite hotel,"I love this place- funky, friendly, very European. Lots to look at and enjoy. Clean, comfy, minimalist well designed rooms. Lovely bar and coffee cart. Breakfast was superb. Check in and out seamless.",5,2023,10,25

243,Not great,"The room is comfortable and reasonably well appointed. I found the front desk service to be rude, and that I was an inconvenience to them.

Negatives
TV wouldn’t let me cast anything to it
Phone wouldn’t connect to reception
The hotel and the bar/restaurant aren’t linked so you can’t charge anything to your room
Breakfast wasn’t included and I wasn’t asked if I wanted to add it at the front desk",2,2023,10,20
243,Great stay and comfortable,"Fantastic people, spacious rooms, comfortable. Food and drinks were lovely. Staff are very friendly, accommodated me well. Clean and vibrant place to be. Location was quiet and central for Dublin City. ",5,2023,10,20
243,Good but expensive,"The location of this place is amazing and the hotel is nice and decent and staff are super nice and friendly, but I found it to be a bit too expensive for the quality of the room which was very basic and very small. ",4,2023,10,18
243,Great hotel with everything you need for a weekend getaway,"We had a brilliant stay here, the hotel is lovely and relaxing with a modern vibe, and in a good central location for exploring Dublin. Room was very spacious with lots of amenities, (we enjoyed the loccitane miniatures in the bathroom!), and the bed was very comfy. We were able to check in an hour early and also were able to leave luggage locked safely away at the hotel reception on our last day before heading back to the airport. Overall would highly recommend staying here!!",5,2023,10,14
243,New hotel in a great location.,"Staff were helpful and friendly. Bedroom was very clean and comfortable. Didnt eat at the hotel but there is a large restaurant/bar area.  Location is wonderful, walking distance to centre of city and 2 minutes from Grafton Street. ",5,2023,10,13
243,Lovely Modern Hotel,"I took a 2 week trip to Dublin and Scotland in September. The Marlin was my 7th hotel in 14 days, and it was a welcome site at the end of my trip. The hotel is modern and hip, my room was enormous and had all the modern conveniences. Floor to ceiling windows! Trust me, after staying in so many hotels that were older, had no elevators, no A/C…I was in heaven at the Marlin. The location is very convenient and you can walk almost anywhere in the city in 10-15 minutes. Loved the bar as well! 
My only complaint is that I was late getting a taxi to the airport in the morning. We couldn’t get a taxi to come, and I ended up having to walk to the park where there’s a taxi line. I feel like the staff should have told me this at the start (instead of having me wait 40 minutes for a cab to never arrive), or they should have an ‘in’ with a taxi company to assure transportation is covered. I’m sure they get a lot of business guests, so this could be an issue. It almost was an issue for me, but thankfully I made it on time for my flight.",5,2023,10,09
243,"Small rooms, poor breakfast.",The hotel is modern but the accommodation is poor. Room very small with little comforts. Breakfast is basic with dried up fried products. Too expensive for the type of offering. Staff are helpful and doing their best. Will not be back.,2,2023,10,09
243,SMALL!!!!,If you are in anyway claustrophobic do not even think about booking  this hotel. I stayed here on a Thursday night and it was €302 for bed and breakfast! Also they only have a residents bar on a friday and Saturday and the rooms dont have an iron. The main downside is though that there are NO tea or coffee making facilities in the room.... for €302! SERIOUSLY! As some one who stays in Dublin at least 3 times a week this is without a doubt a case of this hotel taking full advantage of tourists! Plenty of other hotels in good locations with better rooms. Also if you aren't used to the area and plan on going out at night be aware of the really high homeless and drug use near here.,2,2023,10,08
243,The Good and the Bad,"We booked a ""cozy king room"" for 7 nights.  This was the smallest hotel/motel room you, or I, have ever been in (I think).  The bed is 3 meters square (6 1/2 feet X 6 1/2 feet).  The floor space is about the same, 3 hangers, a few shelves, but a big under-the-bed drawer.  Might be fine for the solo traveler, but for a couple not so.

I'm ranking them down one * because of their almost strict 3 p.m. check-in policy.  Doesn't matter if your room is ready or not.  Lots of people milling around the lobby waiting.  At 2:40 or so, she (desk girl) relented and let people check in.  This is the most outmoded hotel idea ever.  In my lifetime of traveling, what I've experienced is this: if your room has been made up, they'll let you check in early (sometimes hours early).  And, if you call the hotel a day or two ahead, they'll try to have a room ready for your early check in.  Oh, but wait!  A few days before arrival, I received an email offering me early check-in for only 20 euros.  Now, I get what it's all about: the $$.

One very nice feature of this hotel is the free use of a guest laundry (washers and dryers).  Probably the most expensive German-made dryers in the world.  And, the slowest.  Took HOURS to dry a load.  Started one afternoon, everything still wet after an hour+.  Went back the next morning at 6 a.m.  Another hour.  Some stuff still not dry.  Took it up to room to hang out.

Breakfast was buffet style, cold and hot items.  Probably the best I've ever seen.  A coffee machine with latte, cappuccino, mocha, and more choices.

Shower: the glass enclosure doesn't go all around.  That is, there's an opening.  No matter how hard we tried, some water comes out onto the mat on the floor.

Elevators: the best/fastest I've ever been i.  You do need your room card to make them go = good security measure!

And, Irish TV?  Yikes!  If you're American, you'll be happy to find OLD episodes of ""Murder, She Wrote,"" ""NCIS,"" and ""Law and Order.""

With all that said, I would stay here again, if we return to Ireland.  To my mind, the goods and the central location near St. Stephen's Green beats their terrible check-in policy.",4,2023,10,04
243,Good location,"Excellent location for  the Gaiety Theatre and St Stephens Green. Staff were delightful and very accommodating.  Room was on the small side but perfectly adequate for my needs.  Room was clean, bed was comfortable and shower was powerful.  Buffet breakfast had a good selection of hot and cold items. I would stay here again",4,2023,10,01
243,Ok for business,"I have mixed feelings towards this hotel; the positives were really great! The bed, incredibly comfortable (one of the best I’ve stayed in), the rooms are super clean and modern, and the cosy room was indeed cosy without being too small for one person. There’s a gym which is handy too and the location is central.
On the flip side, this hotel is pricey, even for Dublin, a midweek stay with breakfast was around £230, paying this much and having to check in on a screen is enough to stop me coming back. And the breakfast is as poor as most mid-range places; the same low quality ingredients, little choice for dietary requirements or healthy eaters and terrible coffee. I’d stay again on business only, and skip the breakfast for sure.",4,2023,10,01
243,Funky modern hotel in walking distance to Temple Bar,"Great hotel - very clean. Staff was friendly, check in/out was easy! Cute coffee shop and bar. Would recommend and stay again. Rooms a a bit small but large comfortable bed made for an awesome nights rest.",5,2023,09,26
243,wonderful stay ,"the staff were outstanding facilities were  good they even have a guest self do laundry  great air ventilating ,fridge  and bar soap ,shampoo and conditioner  breakfast is very good would not hesitate to recommend this hotel",5,2023,09,23
243,Great hotel,Very comfortable and clean. The rooms were great and I like the overall modern experience in the check in process-very efficient. There desks in the main lobby were convenient. I would definitely stay there agin if I am in Dublin.,5,2023,09,21
243,Boutique hotel and boutique room size,"Outstanding location and very clean with friendly helpful staff. Not recommended for families unless it’s a superior size room. “Smart” light features leave you in the dark most of the time-shake, rattle roll to keep the lights on in the shower/loo:aggravating. Not much privacy there either-glass sliding door. No sitting room extra in king standard. Must climb over bed partner to escape to the loo in the middle of the night. Overall great for single travelers. ",3,2023,09,16
243,So central and clean!,We had a lovely stay in this hotel. The hotel was so central to the city and was so lovely and clean. The self service check in and check out saved so much time. The bar staff were lovely too. We will be back soon!,5,2023,09,16
243,"Functional and modern, but sadly the cleanliness leaves a lot to bei desired","Was staying in this hotel with a friend for 4 nights. We booked a room with a double bed.
The hotel is very modern, stylish and is situated very central within the city, which ist surely convenient as a tourist. 

Regarding the rooms, modern and stylish features sadly impact functionality;
The window can not be opened (however, there is an AC to gwt some ""fresh air""), the shower only has half a glass cabin, which makes spilling water in the flor during a shower inevitable. Moreover the rooms are small. The space ist suficient if you do Not plan to spend a lot of time in your hotel room, but otherwise ist quite limited. 
And, what really bothered us on our stay, ist that the room was not clean:
The bed sheets were unclean (Something like a piece of gum was stuck on them). 
After having the rooms ""cleaned"" from one day to another, the bed sheets were, sadly, even dirtier than before: Now the cleaning personnel had left many hairs on the sheets. 

So, if you value cleanliness, I'd recommend looking for something else to stay. 

",3,2023,09,14
243,Excellent stay with great location,"Clean modern room and bathroom, complimentary water bottles in room, friendly staff, good bar. Excellent location, walking distance from all the main attractions. Can recommend both for singles and couples. Basic rooms have a double bed against the window so keep in mind if you have any difficulties moving.",5,2023,09,14
243,Perfect location!,"Check in was slightly odd as you are asked to do it yourself on a screen but accompanied by a member of staff while doing it. The staff were super helpful and kind throughout our stay. The room was clean and well equipped. The restaurant was lovely, my boyfriend even said it was one of the best burgers he had ever tasted! The location is absolutely perfect for exploring Dublin.",4,2023,09,09
243,What a gem of a hotel!,"Fantastic location- so near to everything but so quiet too. Clean and with excellent facilities and helpful staff. Secure and safe city centre stay. 
We parked at the Red Cow and used the Luas - only €4 for 24hours ! ",5,2023,09,09
243,Pleasant atmosphere and attentive service,"My girlfriend and I visit the Marlin hotel on September 2023 and the room was perfect and clean and it has the biggest bed I ever slept in a hotel.
The service was amazing specially Humberto, who was vey helpful and knowledgeable about the city. He helped us figuring out some issues.
In my option one of the most attentive service I ever had.
",5,2023,09,07
243,Clean and central ,"This hotel is very central to everything, Has everything you need right on your doorstep. Room was spotless. Breakfast is very good, only thing is the sausages are cheap and poor quality. They should invest in better meat for the price you pay. Bar staff in the evening were great, especially Gemma. She gave us lots of recommendations of places to go.
They also have a cabin at the front where you can get takeaway coffees, nice touch seeing as there is no coffee facilities in the rooms. 
I would stay here again. ",5,2023,09,05
243,Dublin break,"A fantastic hotel in a brilliant location. 5 mins walk from Grafton Street and 10 mins from Temple Bar, but still set in a quiet location when you've decided it's time for bed. Room was immaculate. Genuinely a lovely stay ",5,2023,09,01
243,"Not a ""traditional"" hotel.","Central location. Quite expensive. Small rooms. Lots of tech. (some of it not working now...)/modern design/a few staff - you get the idea! Fine for a couple of days if everything runs smoothly. If you have a problem or query, sort it out yourself! Not much help will be forthcoming. Staff disinterested. Too many bad reviews, but I found it OK (just about!)",3,2023,08,29
243,Clean modern hotel,Their hotel is centrally located to everything touristy in Dublin. Super clean and updated rooms!  Lots of plugs for tech. Only detractor was the small size of the room. Wouldn’t be comfortable for two people unless they were minimalists. ,5,2023,08,26
243,Very nice and cozy hotel,"Stayed at the Marlin Hotel Dublin and had a mixed experience. The location is fantastic, and the beds are incredibly comfortable. The place itself is beautiful and cozy, adding to the overall charm.

The service was good, and the breakfast was enjoyable, offering a pleasant start to the day.

However, there were a few drawbacks. The water from the shower often ended up on the floor, which was a bit inconvenient. Additionally, the lack of a refrigerator was a noticeable absence, especially for longer stays.",4,2023,08,25
243,OUTSTANDING PLACE TO STAY 11/10 ,Im writing this while we are still here what an amazing hotel.staff are the most friendliest and helpful people ive met we have stayed in many hotels around the world but the marlin has to be the number one everything from location to spotless rooms everything you need for a comfortable stay it should be a 5 star rating thank you so much for making us feel comfortable. ,5,2023,08,23
243,Fire alarm at 1:30 am!!!,"Lack of staff assistance or any kind of help with a fire alarm breaking at 1:30 am. No words, no help, no explanations!!!
Lack of space in the room (it is very, very small) and not even a remote for the tv was there.",2,2023,08,23
243,Great Stay,Great hotel with an eye to detail. Very clean and the staff very friendly. The breakfast offered a wide selection of food to choose from. Central location with easy access to the city centre. Parking discount is a plus ,5,2023,08,21
243,Very convenient location,"Would recommend staying in the Marlin. It was very convenient for safe parking, Stephens green parking is just across the road and always ample spaces. Quiet room, comfortable bed, relaxing late bar. Clean. Staff very pleasant. Decor is quirky. Central location.",5,2023,08,20
243,Disappointing,"Horrible customer service. The wife was down all day while we were there, preventing communication between our group and also preventing us from finding activities in the area. The night time staff was kind and noted we would get a discount (the cost of the rooms was also $70 more than when we initially booked), but the day time staff did not honor that promise.",1,2023,08,19
243,Mixed experience,"I found the rooms clean with all the necessary toiletries etc.  I was also very happy with the breakfast and the proximity to the Q-Parks where one could park at a discounted rate..
That said the rooms are very small but the biggest problem I had was the fact that the TV was not working.  I drew attention to the matter with reception staff who promised it would be addressed by maintenance personnel.  On returning to the room the following night I was very disappointed to see that the matter had not been addressed. On checking out I again informed reception about the matter.  The person said that on my next stay I would be entitled to some degree of compensation. Later that day I discussed my experience with a hotel manager in the town where I live who also stayed at the Marlin recently and had exactly the same experience but she received no discount or anything on her return stay at the Marlin when she was promised the opposite initially.
Not good enough!
I am also not a fan of this new electronic check in.  While fast the personal touch is always important.",3,2023,08,16
243,"marlin hotel, Dublin","Very comfortable, clean, and safe. The staff was lovely, and very helpful.  Check-in is automated but there was someone there to assist. Parking across the street but accessible enough.  I would recommend both the hotel and the restaurant. ",5,2023,08,16
243,Great hotel amazing staff ,"
We had a great stay at the hotel, the rooms are ok considering the area and the price. We really enjoyed the bar and the food.

243,Claustrophobic rooms,"The rooms are basic and very small . No tea/coffee making facilities, little clothing hanging space , no storage for suitcases bags . Unable to relax and watch television with out it being on top of you …. Puts a whole new meaning on the saying “square eyes” . Definitely not a 4 * hotel ",1,2023,08,12
243,Bank Holiday Sunday,Excellent location. Rooms nice and clean. Excellent value for money. First time ever checking in by touch screen computer very modern and cool. Would definitely check for availability if I was visiting Dublin again ,5,2023,08,10
243,"Spotless, modern and well located hotel!","On arrival, you can check in on the 6 are super easy to use. The reception area is very clean and modern as with the rest of the hotel.

The room itself is small but spotlessly clean. The bed is slightly awkward as it's only accessible from one side.  The bathroom and shower are very good. If you are planning a long stay, think twice as there is minimum storage.
The location of the hotel is excellent. Perfect choice.
The last plus point is the ironing rooms! First time we have seen anything like this, but itso handy! All other hotels should follow!
",5,2023,08,08
243,Average hotel,"Hotel is quite a new hotel and very quirky style to it. However staff in the restaurant/bar very rude to guests and also rooms very small. No kettle,teas,coffees etc in room. Storage in room for guests clothes very minimal. Some things broken in our room I.E tv, blind, bathroom plug. 

Location was quite good was close to shops/bars etc. however you were next to a block of flats in which was unpleasant a lot of drug use going on around the area.",2,2023,08,08

243,Best stay!,"Had an amazing stay here, we were looked after so well by all of the lovely staff especially the manager Luke Taffe. He was so helpful, and made us feel so welcome.
It is in such a great location, cannot wait to return.",5,2023,08,06
243,Ok stay .,"We went for a short staycation from the south . At arrival you have to check in yourself through a kiosk wich is very unwelcoming and bit poor. Doesn’t say anywhere that it is card only payments to check into the hotel as we only had cash and the staff couldn’t help us with it at all and basically said tough. 
The room was pretty small but cosy enough. Definitely wouldn’t last in that room for longer than 4 days so if you’re staying for long don’t bother with this. It’s pretty much layed out like a one person student accomodation. 
The tv netflix didn’t even work as our tv name was changed by someone so couldn’t connect it out of 100 other tvs it was disappointing.
The beds were very comfortable. 
Staff were ok.
We went to ask are they serving dinner and the guy at the host stand just stood there and kinda smirked and stared with no comment then walked away. We didn’t end up eating dinner here.
Breakfast was €17 for a poor buffet. yogurt was sour . 
Location of the hotel is ideal.",3,2023,08,04
243,A wonderfully Pop hotel,"What a great and peculiar experience we had in this hotel. The self check-in/out is quite surprising but effective. The reception area is very cosy and captivating. Really loved it. Regarding the room we had, the bed is huge and comfortable. The bathroom is perfect and so is the incredible position in the heart of Dublin. The city is walkable and all the places of interest are nearby.
I warmly recommend this fantastic hotel.",5,2023,08,02
243,A Dublin Disappointment,"I had a party coming from the US, so I booked two suites in the Marlin, basically because of its location in a safe part of Dublin. One of the visitors was recovering from cancer surgery, and I asked the Marlin to permit her to check in a little earlier than the 3 p.m time stipulated.  The hotel agreed, but charged 20 euros for permitting her to check in around 12:30.   I thought that was miserable.  The party was paying for two suites for almost a week--several thousand euros--charging 20 euros for a slightly early check-in was something I had never experienced in an Irish hotel.
Generally we were quite dissatisfied with the Marlin. Like most hotels in Ireland now, all the staff were non-Irish.  Most had very poor English  There was certainly none of the charming hospitality that Ireland has traditionally offered. Housekeeping was very poor. Trash was not collected, and fresh toiletries were not provided after Day One.  There is an area for washing clothes, but it is not well kept. Some of the machines were dirty, others were out of order.
Food was not great, and expensive. 17 euros for a mediocre breakfast was way too high.  We didn't have dinner, but one evening we had dessert-- two apple pies and one tea. Total cost 30 euros.  Ouch!
One young member of our party lost money during the stay. He dropped his wallet in the lobby.  When he realized and went back, he found the wallet, minus about $150.  We don't expect the Hotel to be a policeman,   but when we reported the matter to the Front Desk and asked for advice  the female Receptionist showed absoslutely no interest.  Didn't even take our details. So much so that the following day we asked to speak to a Manager, who showed a bit more professionalism.  Generally I thought the staff here were poorly trained.
The only real positive I can report is location. The Marlin is situated in a good part of Dublin, safe and with restaurants and bars nearby.
Hotel prices have inflated so much in Dublin that there is little competition for the tourist euro. I felt the rate charged by the Marlin was double what it merited and will never stay there again.",2,2023,07,31
243,Central Hotel,"Great Location - ( mostly )Lovely Staff - Great Hotel Bar with nice staff . Clean BUT room’s absolutely tiny even if you don’t pick the cozy room … not very practical .

243,Great central hotel in Dublin,"I have stayed in The Marlin Hotel a number of times and have always had a good stay. The hotel is clean and comfortable, in a great location and has friendly staff.

243,Great stay in fantastic hotel,"It’s very very Good

First time staying here and I was impressed. In the centre of St. Stephens green with discounted parking and walking distance to shops , restaurants and pubs.

It’s very modern and reception area is very cool and interesting, kiosk check in ( but also reception staff if needed). 
We had a standard room on the 5th floor , huge windows overlooking Dublin ( the new & old ) and very cleverly designed rooms which felt spacious and  are very comfortable.  
Best bed & pillows ever !!
Yes the bed is right beside the wall but that was fine for us. 
The bathroom had a clever sensor light so no need to switch on lights in the middle of the night, a lovely little sitting area & mugs for tea and coffee.
Breakfast was excellent, so much choice & all hot from buffet ( which is unusual ) and again mugs , not little cups. 
Staff are friendly , caring and very well presented.
I have stayed in many Dublin hotels ( including 5* ones) and the Marlin is now top of my list & will definitely be returning. 
Thouraghly enjoyed the stay",5,2023,07,22
243,Worst checkin experience ever!!,"Should have suspected when I received a message the day before letting us know the 'extras' with prices we could book.,i.e. Breakfast (which was included at the time of booking)., early check in, room upgrade.
We arrived early and left our bags in storage and came back ca 1pm. At 1.30, I asked if our room was ready and was told it was, but if I wanted to check in, I had to pay an extra 20 euros! The seating areas were most uncomfortable but when I said it was the first time I had to pay for early check in I was told it wax 'Hotel policy'. On principle, I could not pay it. So I was made wait and when the check-in was opened at 2.30 pm, the receptionist walked by me and brought other people who had just arrived to the automated kiosks to show them how to use them.
I should add that approximately 5 hotel staff were hovering around reception throughout this time.. So much for customer service! I won't be back!
The hairdryer was so cheap it worked for 5 seconds, turned red and then turned off to cool down. I was lucky if I could use it 5 minutes later for another 5 seconds.
To make it worse, I received an automated email to ask me to review them FOLLOWING my review...",1,2023,07,21
243,Great location,Bed was massive they had great breakfast options parking was quite handy though I came out the wrong doors so had to walk a bit but there's a door right facing the hotel with a lift would define stay again ,5,2023,07,19
243,WORST MOST UNSAFE HOTEL and Terrible Service,"WORST HOTEL EXPERIENCE OF MY LIFE and I travel lots. MY COMPUTER BAG WAS STOLEN AS I CHECKED IN.
I arrived with a broken toe and no one came to help. Thankfully a friend could walk to get the trolley. She helped me unload and as we turned to load the last bag my computer bag was stolen off the cart at the entrance.
The staff was extremely dismissive. I spend the whole night at the police station and will likely not recover my $2k MacBook and $1k camera and the staff wouldn’t even offer me a complimentary breakfast at the hotel after I barely slept there.",1,2023,07,18
243,"Great Hotel,Great Location","Really good Value for money,amazing location - loved the self check in area and the hotel spelt amazing! rooms are just what you need for a night or two! Bed was massive and very comfortable overall loved our stay will be back again!",5,2023,07,17

243,Looks good on the surface.,"The property seems clean and up-to-date, but there are some major problems once you check in. Rooms are far too small, and the be is wedged between the walls. One person has to crawl over the other to go to the bathroom during the night. The check-in process is not welcoming. Food was fairly good, but overpriced. On the whole, property pricing was appropriate to a much higher level than we got.",3,2023,07,14
243,What a find,"This little gem of a  hotel is beautifully decorated. It was spotless clean and everything we needed for our stay was provided. 
It’s central location enable us to see a lot of Dublin highlights. It’s comfortable spaces were decorated with taste and care made it feel that we were in a lot of different, the horse box coffee deck the tropical foyer. The scandi sofas and cushions all contributed to the friendly warm and comfortable atmosphere. Will definitely return.",5,2023,07,12
243,This is a hostel not a hotel,"Checkin was automated and the staff stand at your shoulder and issue instructions, repeatedly, one instruction had to be repeated and I was barked at.  Other hotels in the area have much nicer staff and a nicer approach, maintaining the feel of a hotel which this one does not. The rooms are tiny, more like a hostel. The bed is flanked by three walls so climbing is required by the person on the inside if they want to get out of bed when 2 people are in the bed.",1,2023,07,11
243,Good Location,I stayed here for a weekend  (Friday - Sunday) It cost €420 without breakfast. The bed was comfortable but lodged between 3 walls. There was no kettle for tea or coffee in the room and the room was extremely small for the price. The location is perfect though but I’m sure there are better options!,3,2023,07,10
243,Really good,"Lovely hotel, central location. Huge and super comfy bed. Spotless clean when we got there. Staff was very helpful : gave us directions and a map on what to see; booked us a cab for the return to the airport. We didn’t use the restaurant for breakfast or dinner so I can’t say anything. We went to the bar twice: amazing cocktails and the staff really looked after us, bit of chat. There’s always someone in the lobby, either reading or working. Despite a huge building outside, we couldn’t hear any noise (we used to London nocturnal chaos). If you get the coach from the airport (Dublin express) it’s the last stop - harcourt luas (if I spelled it correctly). A bit of walking about from the stop. Will definitely go back.",5,2023,07,08
243,"Good location, nice atmosphere, room for improvement","This hotel is just blocks away from Grafton Street shopping and dining. Plus, many historical attractions and other points of interests are all within a 5 to 25 minute radius. This makes the Marlin a good place to look into. They also have a quirky and inviting atmosphere with breakfast and a bar onsite. The hotel is clean, overall, and has AC. 
However, there were a few drawbacks or points to consider before booking:
- The “cozy king” is best for one person or two people with limited luggage. Great for one person, but tight for two average sized 30-something’s with one suitcase each. 
- Breakfast is not included. You can purchase it for around 20€. Fairly good selections, including Irish breakfast staples, cereals, toast, etc. and accommodations for those with dietary needs. Powdered orange juice, which seemed out of place. 
-  The bathroom fan in our room wasn’t working and there were signs of mold (this was hopefully fixed once we left, as we did let them know) 
- Laundry is available for free. However, the washer worked but the dryer didn’t. Staff weren’t able to help and no warning was given ahead of time. 
- Driving to the hotel can be dicey due to one way streets and the busy Grafton Street area. Plan accordingly to drive a little out of your way and save a lot of time (and nail biting)",3,2023,07,05
243,Great place ,"We went to with my boyfriend for the weekend,
It’s a good atmosphere, excellent staff service and the bedrooms have a nice quality. They have a huge bar and restaurant. The food is really tasty and we met a bartender called  Daniel, he was looking after the costumers and recommend us places to visit. Also he prepared unreal cocktails. We are going to come back for sure. ",4,2023,07,04
243,Avoid!,"Shoddy underhanded behavior from the management Andrei. Be very careful staying at the hotel. We needed to cancel our booking due to a death in the family. Booking.com said no problem. However the hotel manager point blank refused and told us we could have another date or we woild be charged as they have our credit card on file. He also said that it was booking.com who would not allow us to cancel, not him. This is despite the fact that booking.com we’re doing their upmost to get him to allow us to cancel?!?  We didn’t want to loose the money so stayed the night. However, on arrival it turns out that they did not in fact have our credit card on file and we needed to give it again in order to stay at the hotel. Most unfriendly staff. Awful service. The beds are like cots in a youth hostel. Avoid this place at all costs.",1,2023,07,03
243,Decent hotel. Poor restaurant,"Pros: Spotless rooms, good location, nice staff, cool decor. 

Cons: poor restaurant (very disorganised, food was served cold however I didnt want to kick up a fuss). The food was very bad value for money under the circumstances. 

Visitors need to consider the checkout process too.

Cons: its at 11, not 12. Not very much is done to bring this to your attention either which is unfortunate as 12 is the standard in Ireland.

Pros: The staff were kind enough to be forgiving on account of the fact that I checked out late in light of the above.

Overall, I would reccomend it. Just dont eat there and beware of the early checkout time.",3,2023,07,03
243,Like it,"We like it☺️ came back on next trip. Clear room, comfortable bed, it was great experience ☺️ near hotel was many pub, terraces, shopping centre, parking, location is very great for few days. We like it! ",5,2023,06,30
243,Standard rooms are small but very clean,"Perfect for one person. Couples might want to spend a little more upgrading to a bigger room 
Like all hotels in Dublin rooms are expensive compared to international prices
Breakfast also a little expensive at 17 euro per person
Location is excellent 
",4,2023,06,28
243,"Modern, clean hotel in central Dublin","What is not to like about Marlin Bow Street, Dublin? Great modern building, compact comfy rooms, central location near St Stephens Green. Quiet location yet a short walk to the heart of Dublin town.  Great for couples and business.  We will stay again.",5,2023,06,27
243,We loved this hotel. ,From the moment we arrived here we loved it. We checked in and went to the bar/ restaurant for some food and a drink. The staff were brilliant  and the food was excellent as was the 2 pints of guinness i had. The location is as good as it gets being in the centre of Dublin next to Stephens green and Grafton street. This is a fantastic hotel and we would highly recommend staying here. We both love Dublin and get up from Cork as often as possible. Well done The Marlin if only all hotels were run like this. ,5,2023,06,24
243,Huge Comfy Bed ,"We visited Dublin for a long weekend and so pleased we choose to stay here. The room was high tech, the bed was huge & comfy and everything was clean with no complaints. They were helpful and handy to have the water bottles. Perfect location as everything was in walking distance. Expensive but everything in Dublin is. We miss the large bed already! ",5,2023,06,19
243,Very fashionable hotel,"The lobby stood out at this hotel. It was very spacious and a great place to relax while you're waiting to check-in. While it was on the more expensive side for such a small room, it was very beautiful. There were USB chargers everywhere which was nice for international travel. Everything was clean and had very nice lighting. Very comfortable bed which was enormous, just very very small living space and no easy way to store your luggage.",5,2023,06,19
243,Good location but tiny room and could hear everyone around me,"Newer hotel with e cells T location in city center - sterile feel, very high-tech with room that made me feel I was on a ship it was tiny and crammed with stuff - people upstairs had a big fight at 4 AM and I could hear everything - not well insulated at all - plenty of other hotels in the area and I would choose one of them next time",2,2023,06,19
243,Great hotel in a great location,"Lovely hotel in a great city centre location. The room was spacious and  very clean. The bed was a good size, very comfortable and the bathroom was big too! 
Check-in was quick, however the self service check-in in the lobby made it a bit impersonal.
Overall it was very nice, would definitely recommend and look forward to staying here again",4,2023,06,16
243,Great visit.,"Staff and accommodations were wonderful. Whole visit ran very smoothly. We would recommend the hotel, amenities, and dining to all to enjoy. The view and location are spectacular and cannot be matched anywhere in Bantry.",5,2023,06,11
243,Great central hotel,First time in Dublin and wanted a central location. The Marlin hotel was perfect! Super close to attractions and shops. Buses and Luas stops were only 5 minutes away. Small room but it made good use of the space. Modern amenities throughout the hotel. Staff was helpful when needed. Would not hesitate to stay at the Marlin again.,5,2023,06,09
243,Loved this hotel,"What can i say? I love this hotel. Its modern, bright, dynamic, totally funky and unlike anywhere I have stayed before. It was also better value than other hotels near by. 

I had the snug king and despite being small, was very comfortable and had good amenities. The food was great, service excellent. If I am back in the centre of Dublin, I am staying here...",5,2023,06,08
243,Concert stay,Ideal location close to all necessary services. Perfect location for a short stay in Dublin city centre. Rooms are spotless and extremely well maintained. You are guaranteed a goods night's sleep in this amazing hotel. ,5,2023,06,06
243,Would stay here again!,"Great location, great breakfast,  very helpful and friendly staff. We would definitely stay here again. Rooms were small but very clean and comfortable. Walking distance to a lot of attractions and b great restaurants. ",5,2023,06,05
243,Fantastic hotel,"Very enjoyable stay. Check in and out very easy and parking very convenient nearby. Room was fab,so comfy and clean. Lobby and bar lovely. Breakfast was lovely. Location is fantastic convenient to anything in the city centre. Definitely will book again.",5,2023,06,04
243,Work bbq,"We had a work bbq last night for 45 people @ the Marlin and quite simply it was superb, the food was top notch, the cocktails were incredible so a huge thank you to Emma-Jane, Patrick and all the staff for a fabulous night…. We’re thinking of Christmas party already!! Mick ",5,2023,05,26
243,Over rated,"price is over rated to the service offered. breakfast was poor, mattress is not good couldn't sleep well at night. to be fair the rooms are clean and well maintained, but they kept only 1 still water in the room while all other hotels keep 2 bottles. car park is in the mall opposite, so it's not at all convenient with the luggage to transport",3,2023,05,26
243,OK Average,"Room is absolutely tiny. Bed built in to wall. No tea/coffee facilities. Checking in system very intuitive. Min contact with staff so cant comment. Very expensive for a tuesday night & no breakfast.  Its OK, but nothing memorable.
Good location.",3,2023,05,19
243,"Nice, comfortable, solid hotel","This was an interesting hotel with a few quirks but overall, we really enjoyed our stay. The hotel has a bit of a ""hipster"" vibe with self check-in kiosks, a small guest services desk, and a cool coffee shop in the lobby. You can't beat the location for nightlife, entertainment, food, and shopping. 

We reserved a cozy king room for our 2-night stay and the space was more than adequate. It resembled an interior cruise ship cabin so use that for reference. The bed was comfortable, the A/C worked well (after reprogramming the thermostat), and the bathroom was efficient. I really wish more hotels would put doors on their showers though. We ended up flooding the floor of the bathroom after each shower. Overall though, the room was great.

Something of note, the hotel does have on-site guest laundry in the basement which is free of charge! This is outstanding and very much appreciated! The laundry soap and fabric softener were $2 each however, the washers and dryers were complementary. 

During our stay, we celebrated a birthday. Vladimir at the front desk was extremely kind enough to help set up a special birthday surprise for my partner for which I was grateful! Many thanks to Vladimir for helping with that.  

We had dinner in the on-site restaurant one night. The burger tasted like the meat patty came from Burger King and the french fries tasted as if they came from McDonald's. The fries were great, don't get me wrong, but they looked, smelled, and tasted like McDonald's fries - ha! Breakfast was a bit lackluster, resembling something you'd find in an airport lounge but, the coffee worked well enough.",4,2023,05,19
243,Cool design Hotel,"Very nice Hotel with cool design elements. This Hotel is located very well close to the main attractions of Dublin. Infrastructure around the Hotel is good, public transport close. Would recommend this Hotel and would go there again if in the area.",5,2023,05,17
243,Great Stay,"We had a fab stay at this hotel, its very quirky, loved the decor.
Comfiest bed ever.
Great location in the middle of everything.
Lovely polite staff.
Great Breakfast.
We will definitely be back to this hotel.

",5,2023,05,15
243,Ideal location for exploring Dublin ,"Room was compact but ideal for purpose of exploring Dublin. Central location. Room wasn't the cleanest, but just a bit dusty so we didn't complain.
We didn't eat at the hotel, but had lovely coffee from the cart at the front door.
I would stay again.",3,2023,05,14
243,Central location at good price,"Good breakfast options, new and clean rooms but easily the best thing is the location. Conveniently located centrally for all the major Dublin attractions and for easy transport connections to attend client meetings or quickly getting to the airport.",4,2023,05,14
243,Great place to stay for business or pleasure,"I loved the hospitality and convenience of the Marlin which is just a very short walk from St Stephen's Green, heaps of restaurants (the excellent Bambino Pizza shop is just a few minutes walk away), and the always interesting Grafton Street shopping strip. It's a very well equipped hotel with really comfortable beds, well designed rooms, and a restaurant and bar onsite. The staff were all incredibly helpful, relaxed and friendly.  I had a longish stay and really appreciated the hotel's quality laundry, gym and other facilities. It's a very pleasant and comfortable place to stay either for work or for pleasure, and I'd happily book-in again.
Anne, Sydney.",5,2023,05,13
243,"Great location, super comfy beds & sound proof rooms","City centre location but rooms are sound proofed from outside noise.  Very comfy bed & pillows.  Clean, bright & friendly hitel with a good bar & coffee shop on site too.  One minute walk to shopping, pubs & good restaurants; Approximately two blocks from St Stephen's Green - great location for nightlife, food & tourist attractions. 
",5,2023,05,12
243,Very cool Bar,"Beautiful hotel, really good location and room was great! Went to the bar and live DJ playing vinyl was really cool! Special thanks to Daniel and Luis in the bar. Very friendly and professional, and looked after us all night. Both are a credit to the establishment ",5,2023,05,10
243,Excelent service,"Excellent service.  We stayed 5 days with my partner, the location is privileged, although it doesn’t make you want to go out 😄, abundant breakfast and the hotel bar is great and entertaining.  Daniel the nicest bartender I have ever met gave us everything we wanted to know about the city, that it was the best possible panorama, I will come back for sure",5,2023,05,10
243,Excellent Hotel,"Very nice, clean Hotel.
Service was excellent and all who worked there couldn't be more helpful.
I would book again.
Room was spotless and really modern.
Food was excellent and bar staff were pleasant. ",5,2023,05,09
243,Double charge disaster,"This was a nice hotel. Quirky and modern. Beautiful interiors. This is where the positives end.

The check-in system needs to be changed. We arrived and were greeted with self check-in kiosks. They were straight forward to use but are impersonal. I paid with apple pay on my phone. When the cards went to print, an error message displayed on the screen. The lady at the front desk called us over. We were asked to pay again. I checked my bank account and seen the money had gone out. I showed the woman and she said it would be reversed but she would me to pay again. I offered to pay in cash as I no longer had the required funds. She said that they don't accept cash. I said that there was no way for me to pay until i received the earlier payment again. They allowed us to check-in and we would reconvene the following morning. 

The money went back into my account. As I was leaving early the following morning, I sent my boyfriend the required money to pay on check out. He paid on check out without a problem on his card. 4 days later i noticed the money had been taken from my account again. I rang the hotel and was hung up on on the first attempt. On the second attempt, I was told to put all the card details and booking details in an email and send it to them. After hearing nothing back, I rang them a third time to be told there was nothing they could do and to contact my bank as it ""was problem"". My bank couldn't reverse the money as payment had already gone through; it was the hotel's responsibility. I rang the hotel yet again to speak with management as nobody from management had spoken to me yet. Management said they couldn't see my card on their system and that they would get in touch with their bank to see if they could resolve it. I mentioned how i had paid with apple pay and was told apple pay changes the card number for security reasons so they would need to go back through all the payments to check to see which was mine.  I was told by the manager that he would call me back the following day to tell me the outcome. 

That night, through investigating of my own, I found the card number apple pay uses on my device. To anyone in future in a similar predicament, follow these steps. Go into apple wallet; tap the three dots in the top right; ""card details"" and the last four digits will be by apple pay. Hearing nothing back the next day, I rang the hotel to be told the manager I had been speaking to and who told me he would call back was off on holidays. I provided the apple pay card number and 15 minutes later i received an email with an apology and told my money would be back in 2-10 days. I finally received it 3 weeks after staying. 

It really put a sour taste on the stay. A regular check-in desk would be much more efficient. 

The shower had no door and water dripped out onto the floor. 

It would take a quite a bit of convincing to stay here again. The only saving grace it had was the interior design. ",1,2023,05,08
243,Top notch bar service,"The room was a but cramped and the besld wasn't super comfortable, however the staff, especially Daniel the bartender, were very friendly and helpful. We met Daniel on our first night staying at Marlin Hotel and he gave us a lot of great tips and ideas for places to go in our travels around Dublin. He was a very attentive and friendly bartender who was polite and also made great espresso martinis and old fashioned. I felt a little bad because he told us about some great pubs, but we kept coming back to the lobby bar because it was such a great vibe. ",4,2023,05,08
243,Premium price. Average stay.,"On arrival the check in system was down. I checked in after 3pm and the room was not ready. I had to come back to reception and leave my bag in to get to my appointment. On my return the evening I found the room clean and neat.
The room itself was very compact with a king size bed squeezed in at the end. The bathroom was just as tiny. The shower unit had no door, so water splashed onto floor and the water pressure was weak. I could not find a switch for the extract fan in bathroom and the mirrors was steamed up.
This is not a room for two people and putting in such a large bed makes it much smaller. For the price paid, you expect much better. So overall I think this was well overpriced. The hotel décor is smart and interesting. The lobbies, waiting areas and restaurant bar are pleasant spaces.
",3,2023,05,08
243,Bit of a let down,"Mod cons didn't help as bed is built into walls so both have to exit bed the same way. Might as well of slept on the floor as mattress was very uncomfortable. Only had to deal with a small portion of staff but wish I hadn't as they weren't very personal or welcoming,  however,  they were professional in fairness. Walls are paper thin too so you hear everything - probably the highlight of our stay! Positives are the location,  modern, clean overall (our sheets had some stains and wife is pregnant so I was sensitive to this and can't give an overall positive review for cleanliness). €350 for a Friday is steep too!",1,2023,05,07
243,Great Hotel Great Location,"The hotel is really nicely decorated and the vibe is calm and kinda lo-fi! Our room was on the small side but for one night everything we needed and a super comfy bed. I’d note in our room the bed is against the wall so anyone with extra needs or just wants 2 open sides maybe ask in advance about that. There is no fridge/kettle or room service (in the basic room at least) but there is a tv/WiFi/hairdryer. Again no problem for one night. Food in the hotel was lovely, the Guinness was on the cold side as it often is in pubs & bars. Didn’t sample the cocktails but they looked very nice being served. Our room was relatively quiet a big plus! You’re right beside Stephen’s Green shopping centre. We went to the Olympia it’s a short walk or €7 in a taxi on a rainy evening! Paid for breakfast in the morning a bit pricy but it was very nice offering. There are lots of local eateries to choose from if you don’t want the hotel usual. Staff were all very pleasant. We had no issues. Parking is €25 at qpark (hotel discount) WiFi was fine for browsing, saw others working there in the lobby. The horsebox with coffees and cakes is a nice touch. ",4,2023,05,06
243,Appalling customer service,"Alarm went off at approx 3am….staff unable to turn it off so they had to disconnect electricity to our room
We had no electricity for rest of night
We were eventually moved to another room at 7am on other side of hotel….not even an apology !
Would not recommend this hotel",1,2023,05,03
243,"Good, but missing some basics","Comfortable rooms and friendly staff.  The rooms for ironing were a help. Very centrally located. The rooms are spartan - no instant coffee or tea, no hairdryer, no mini fridge. No room service, though there is a 24-hour SPAR convenience store nearby. My room (348) had a weird airlock outside the hallway that would cause the door to slam against its doorjam from about 10am. I think it was because there was a large cleaners' closet across from my room that when closed forced my door against the doorjam. Expensive room, given these issues. ",3,2023,05,01
243,1 experience wrecked what would be a lovely hotel,Very annoyed the the smoke alarm started to go off at 2am. Tried calling down to which the phone did not work. A member of staff the came and could not turn it off. 20 minutes later what I assume was the manager arrived to the turn it off at the main switch. We was then told there was not enough oxygen in the room and too much carbon monoxide. And was left to it. No offer of another room. So unfortunately my score is reflected on this one experience.,1,2023,05,01
243,Loved it ,"I was staying here with my partner for the night It was a last minute booking, I really enjoyed my stay, very friendly staff very helpful, great location in Dublin for shopping and good news by places to eat I will definitely be making a return trip.",5,2023,04,28
243,A fantastic hotel all round,My self and my daughter spend a night in the Marlin in April for her birthday it was just fantastic and made our trip so memorable i cant wait to go back . My daughter loves a shopping trip and the location could not have been better. The staff are the most friendly and helpfull that i have met in many years of traveling . I would recommend this hotel to any one who is looking for a city stay thats very calm and relaxing. Just fantastic,5,2023,04,25
243,"Single room - awful value, avoid","The single room is the size of a coffin with no tea or coffee facilities , extra linen etc. ridiculously expensive for what it is, there are much better options available even in this location in Dublin, don’t waste your money. ",2,2023,04,19
243,"Nice, ""smart"" and city centered hotel","A very good option for travelers who wish to stay in a hotel very near to the city center of Dublin. Room had a great king size bed with a comfortable mattress. Bathroom was also very nice and overall clean (except from some detalis..). The size of the room was OK, if there where some places to store your luggage correctly it would be better. Overall, I would recommend it, especially for prices less than 200€ / per night. The only thing that I did not like was the overcharge (20€) if you wanted to check in an hour earlier than the arranged (15:00).",4,2023,04,17
243,Build houses with these mattresses,"Nice looking hotel but that's about it. Comfort is the most important feature of a hotel and sadly there wasn't any. Instead I got 3 nights of the most painful sleep I've ever had from the hardest mattress I've ever come across, like sleeping on bricks covered with a duvet.  Still in pain 4 days after my return. Hotels response was that they have one of the best mattresses in the market. Absolute rubbish!!
",1,2023,04,10
243,It's Youth Hostel quality. Book only if its cheaper than other 2 to 3 star hotels in the area. Do NOT pay premium. They are nowh,"The Marlin Dublin is somewhere between a clean youth hostel and a 3 star hotel. Them claiming to be a 4 star hotel is ridiculous though.
The rooms are tiny and of the quality of what you would expect at a youth hostel.
No mini bar, view of a wall (like literally looking at a wall - which they call inner yard but actually is a wall) and basic service (the curtains in my room broke and I was told they cannot be fixed today because there are no maintenance staff working today, so I spent a whole day without sunlight in the room).
 The location is great and the place is clean, so as long as the cost is not too high, its a good option, however don't let them charge you four (or even three) star prices because that's just not what they are.
Central Dublin is expensive,  so up to 100 Euros a night is probably OK, anything above that I would recommend to look for another youth hostel or two to three star hotel instead. ",1,2023,04,09
243,Excellent hotel,We enjoyed our stay very much.  Comfortable beds and good restaurant.  Staff was very helpful.  Bed was interesting getting in and out of if by the window but we made due.  Only complaint would be nice if bathroom door stayed open when needed.  Good breakfast.,5,2023,04,09
243,Great value and location,"I was very impressed with this hotel, particularly as it was very good value. It has key attributes, a very comfortable bed, spotless, very quiet and idea location. I organised an early check in so avoided using the check in machine. I had limited interaction with staff, though they were helpful and proactive when I did. Improvements would be a kettle in the room and toiletries in pumps for the environment. I would stay again.",4,2023,04,09
243,Just a bit more info,"A bit of a notice in lift to use your room key to get to your room, instructions for TV, menu for breakfast etc would be useful, coffee in foyer is good, staff are great but little things overlooked, rooms perfectly formed, bed comfy, just looking a tiny bit more info... Will be back for a third visit! ",4,2023,04,08
243,Central location,"This is my third time to stay in this hotel, the other two were during covid. This time I had my husband and teenage kids with me. We had a cosy king while the kids had a twin. The cosy king rooms are like the yotel/citizen m hotel concept. This is one of the best locations in Dublin so the room is compact, like a ships cabin with clever storage and a comfy bed. The twin was just like a regular hotel room. I’ve seen some of the negative comments about the cosy king size so maybe they should work on ensuring customers understand what they are booking. I’ve also seen some people comment about having to climb over each other to get out of bed but the bed is square so you should just move the pillows to under the window and sleep that way. The lobby has a co-working space and coffee cart, very handy if you need to catch up on work. I found the coffee to be poor so I only tried it once which is a pity. Overall, when compared to the price of other hotels in the Stephen’s Green area it offers excellent value. Staff were all helpful and friendly.",5,2023,04,07
243,Ridiculously small rooms!,Rooms are ridiculously small - not sure how they pass fire regulations as one person has to get out of bed to let the other out! Parking is an additional 25 euro. Breakfast was not included. Overpriced for what felt more like a hostel. ,1,2023,04,05
243,Amazing,"Stayed for here 2 nights beginning of April. We had a cosy king room, the room was really clean and the bed was so big and comfy! The room itself was a bit on the smaller side but we didn’t want to be spending time in the room anyway so it was fine! Breakfast was amazing, the food was delicious!!
Hotel staff so friendly, helpful and welcoming.
Really good location. Would highly recommend and will definitely stay here next time.",5,2023,04,03
243,Lovely  night stay,"We enjoyed a night in Dublin and stayed at the Marlin hotel. It was a lovely  experience,really comfortable  bed,fabulous  shower.Only negative is no windows to open,we like fresh air but air con was excellent and we had a great nights sleep. Also the room was a bit tight with the bed up against the wall.",5,2023,04,03
243,Electricity turned off in room all night,"Checking in was a breeze with self check in. Room was very cozy. However we went down to the bar, I would say there was about 15 people there including ourselves, ordered drinks, staff kept coming back to table to confirm drinks and spent an obscene amount of time making them, would understand if bar was busy but it was far from it.

Back to the room later that night, a random alarm was going off around 2am. I rang down to reception to let them know, a member of staff arrived shortly after to let me know in order to turn the alarm off they needed to shut the electricity off in our room, he could see if we could change rooms, it was half 2 in the morning and we didn’t have the energy to pack everything up in the middle of the night to be moved.

At check out a member of staff asked how our stay was, I explained it was terrible and what had happened and he didn’t really care, he just said oh it’s out of our control. I will never stay here again. 

Please train your staff to a level that represents the location of your hotel. ",2,2023,03,30
243,Just perfect,"A place were you are welcoming, everything is made for your confort. And the surroundings are so cool…. Temple bar is definitely less attractive…a true Dublin’s experience with less tourist and more locals",5,2023,03,29
243,Amazing,"Highly recommend this hotel.  Staff very helpful and professional, restaurant bar area very good, service excellent. Hotel room very well thought out, bed was extremely cosy/comfy. Decor and communal areas fabulous.  Thoughtful zones for just relaxing and then spaces for working.  They really have thought of everything.  Location is perfect for walking to Temple Bar and all the attractions.  ",5,2023,03,28
243,Unhelpful and inflexible timings ,"The hotel was inflexible with check in times and staff weren’t very helpful. We were staying during March which is an incredibly busy time in Dublin, but they were so insistent everyone checked in at 3pm so there was a mad rush for check in at that time - the rooms were clearly ready as check out is 11am, it made no sense to check everyone in at 3pm. There was a queue of people who had been waiting to check in for a while. Rooms were comfortable and clean and the hotel is in a good central location,  but inflexible on timings which sadly wasted people’s time. ",3,2023,03,27
243,The best hosts,The hotel is very well located. You are in the center of south dublin and everything is within walkable distance. The service of the hosts is very good. There was made a misstake in the restaurant and they compensated us with a free dinner.  Our main host was Daniel who was very friendly and helpfull. Gave us a lot of information about the do abouts in the city.,5,2023,03,26
243,Car parking costs..Be aware,"When I booked, I was advised that parking was free in the adjacent multi story car park(across the road from the hotel) and my parking ticket would be validated at reception on departure,to reflect same.

On check out next day at 10.45am,my parking ticket was validated at reception but on driving out of the car park, my ticket was not accepted at the exit.

I phoned the car park attendant who advised that the Marlin have a number of packages with various car park charges and that I would not be the first customer of the hotel who was advised of free car parking by the hotel but had to pay!

I returned to reception, to be curtly advised by the receptionist that the parking costs were my business and not the hotels!!!
She advised that my package excluded car park costs, I booked on the understanding that car park costs were included, as I asked that question when booking..

Such a change of attitude from the previous pleasant customer friendly staff interactions!!!

I was under time pressure, otherwise I would have insisted on a refund.

So it cost me €22.50 car parking costs to stay in the Marlin!!!!

I had given the hotel a 5 star rating on Trip Advisor earlier that morning and based on my car parking experience I would withdraw it if possible.",1,2023,03,26
243,Lovely Hotel,"Super clean, nice room with comfy bed and big windows,great breakfast.love the design in the lobby, nice location close to everything you want to see and do in Dublin City. Close to Luas line to bring you deeper into the city.",5,2023,03,25
243,Best hotel in Dublin,"On my Europe trip I stayed in 4 different hotels and this one was definitely my favorite of them all! It was so nice and the bed was so comfortable I slept 11 hours straight. It did not feel like a hotel, more like a nice studio apartment. The lobby is super cute too!",5,2023,03,24
243,Excellent short stay in Dublin,"Excellent hotel in the centre of Dublin. Within walking distance to Temple Bar and all the central bars and restaurants. 30 min taxi from the airport. I would stay again at this hotel on a trip to Dublin. Hotel room very spacious, clean & comfortable. ",5,2023,03,20
243,Great Secret hotel,"the hotel is a great location, I mean to put this hotel in perspective its cheaper than a travel lodge in Dublin, but the hotel is of a very high standard, the room was lovely, staff were great,. hotel itself is very clean. I did go out for dinner, but i had breakfast in the hotel and that was excellent. You need to add at 50 - 100 euros a night to room rate before you would get a better hotel in this location.",5,2023,03,20
243,good location,"room was very small but quiet. the bathroom need reparations. I took an early flight, so I didn't appreciate that the staff did nothing to check if my room was ready, sending me out in the rain for 3 hours.",3,2023,03,15
243,Great Location,"We just stayed here for the weekend, the hotel itself felt fairly new and was modern.
Had a nice little coffee truck in the reception and a large bar and seating area.
Check in, in my eyes was pointless, its self service check in which probably takes 10 mins longer than a real human but hey ho.
Rooms were basic but the bed was very comfy, nice duvet and pillows, big bed!
Tv had crome cast so could watch Netflix etc.
A few annoyances was not much hanger space for clothes, the bathroom lights were on a timer so half way through the loo or in the shower the lights would turn off and the shower leaked into the hallway.
Location was perfect, close to a ton of bars, restaurants and shops, Guinness factory only 25 minute walk and temple bar 10 minute walk.",5,2023,03,13
243,Weekend stay,"Had a great weekend stay at the Marlin hotel. Fantastic location and room was compact but with everything we needed. Bed was really big and comfortable. Bathroom was really clean with a good shower and lovely L’occitane toiletries. Would really recommend, especially to couples on a city break.",5,2023,03,12
243,Excellent Hotel and a great location,Very clean hotel and in a great location.  I had requested a quiet room as was travelling for work and that is exactly what I got.  I got a room on the 6th floor and heard very little noise throughout my stay.  You can check-in and check-out without going near the reception desk which is great but because of this I did not meet any staff.  Lovely sized bed and big tv.  Bathroom was small but lovely shower and fluffy towels.  I would recommend this hotel if you are staying in Dublin.,4,2023,03,10
243,Temple Bar Dublin,"Spacious lobby and restaurant.  Staff helpful.  While on the small side, the room is very well laid out like a cruise ship cabin and very clean and quiet.  One block off the pub lined streets to give you a break after a full day in Dublin.  ",5,2023,03,04
243,Didn't want to leave,"Came for lunch last minute and very glad I did. Beautiful hotel, beautiful food and coffee, and fantastic staff who are very friendly and go over and above. I highly recommend and looking forward to coming back for a stay...and don't think I would leave the hotel whilst I was here 😀  Thanks for everything ",5,2023,03,02
243,Excellent short stay hotel,Stayed here for a work trip and found the facilities and staff great. Room is small but comfortable and there is tonnes if space to work throughout downstairs. Had an excellent cheeseburger too. Would stay again,5,2023,03,01
243,Very disappointing experience,Staff very unhelpful. Fou d the hotel to be chaotic. Broken kettle intercom.Replaced by another broken kettle which I tried to use when staff member was beside me. He left it with me and refused my request for a cup of tea from somewhere.,1,2023,02,27
243,Nice hotel,"Lovely hotel but not-so-great service, the young reception staff was friendly and helpful, as well as the breakfast staff who was accommodating, however gentleman who I believe was the manager was unhelpful with lost items and simple requests",1,2023,02,26
243,"Avoid, thieves, double charging and awful staff",The staff were awful. I had expensive items stolen from the hotel bar. they refused to check the CCTV saying they were to busy. probably because their staff took it. I've now had to contact the police. I also tried to organise a surprise for my partners birthday of which they completely forgot and they charged me twice for it!! awful staff non spoke very good English and overpriced. I hope the police get the CCTV they refused to download for me. the combined value of the hood stole from the bar was approximately £1000 and they didn't even care. ruined my experience of Dublin completely.,1,2023,02,26
243,Excellent hotel,"Very modern and clean, in walking distance of everything. The room was very clean with a lovely shower. Breakfast was very comprehensive with everything you can think of provided. The hotel staff were very helpful and friendly. We will return to this hotel when visiting Dublin.",5,2023,02,26
243,Great stay!,Lovely modern city centre hotel. Second time staying here and very impressed again. Rooms are spacious and comfortable- tv has Crome cast so ideal to throw on Netflix and Spotify. We also got lunch before check in which was very nice and reasonably priced. Would recommend.,5,2023,02,25
243,Short city break,"This Hotel is in a great location in the center of Dublin. Lovely modern building with all the facilities  you could want in house, including a good breakfast and evening food. You are in walking distance to a lot of great pubs and restraunts. The national Muesium and Art gallery is close by and close to main cinemas too. 
I would highly reccomend a stay in this Hotel. ",5,2023,02,22
243,Great place to stay that won’t break the bank,Great funky hotel. Lovely staff. Clean quiet room- small but with everything in it. It was in a perfect location for my trip. Everything was within walking distance. Would definitely recommend this hotel to anyone. ,5,2023,02,22
243,Good but room for improvement,"The hotel is modern and very close to the city which enables you to walk around Dublin without making much (or any) use of public transportation. The room is comfortable and the bathroom is stocked with L'Occitane products. However there is some room for improvement:
- the size and placement of the bed leads to it only being accessible from one side
- the automated bathroom light remains on for long after turning off all lights which is disruptive
- there is no low light in the room so the lighting is either pitch black or very bright
- there are no tea/coffee facilities in the room, although water is provided
- there are only 3 hangers which is inconvenient for longer stays, however the bed has a storage drawer underneath it
- an impersonal check-in counter 
- the aircon reset itself to 22 degrees in the night despite being set at a different temperature",4,2023,02,19
243,Lacking hospitality,Stayed here for one night. Not really impressed! Sterile check in and out. Very small room. Good location and very clean. Would not return. I have used lots of self service hotels when abroad but they were usually the cheap downmarket hotels.,3,2023,02,17
243,Marlin Hotel,"My stay at the Here was very comfortable, very close to Dublin central. 
The bar staff were very friendly and always accommodated especially Paula from Barcelona, all staff at the bar were friendly. 
The room itself was spacious and comfortable with a large window so there was plenty of light. The bathroom was also spacious and clean. 
The only issue I had was I needed to use the laundry facilities and approached reception staff, the one member told me to wait for him in the laundry area and he would bring the key, I waited for him for 45 mins before returning to reception to only find out he had forgotten, that did make me feel irrelevant.",3,2023,02,14
243,Terry,"Everything good, especially  handy parking. Just one issue,  it seemed to take forever for hot water in shower and sink to reach required  temperature 🌡 we were on 6th floor. Otherwise excellent  hotel and glad we chose bigger room for only  9 euro more.",4,2023,02,14
243,"Excellent Hotel, Great Value","My husband and I stayed here for one night during a brief trip to Dublin. We booked the smallest room and I wasn't sure what to expect, but it was honestly so cozy and the bed was so comfortable! The staff was attentive during check in / check out, and the location couldn't be beat! Every main attraction we wanted to visit was within walking distance. The bathroom was clean, the shower was hot. It wasn't luxurious, but it was exactly what we were looking for, and a great value all around!",5,2023,02,13
243,"Lovely hotel in Dublin, Marlin Hotel.","This hotel is so close to everything the tourist will want. Firstly the check-in is smooth there is a staff member there to assist you. I stayed in room 243, a lovely modern clean room and a very comfortable bed. The food is really good and the staff are all so lovely and helpful. There is a local shop if you last-minute things about3-minutes walk away called Dunnes. The Dubin Castle is 10 minute's walk away from the hotel. The Jamieson whisky tour is 10 minutes away for example. The GPO museum is also about 10 minutes' walk away.... this is a very good central hotel. There are lots and lots of bars and restaurants nearby too... I ate in a cafe and at the hotel.... the food is very good here I have to say!! Everything is accessible and the rooms are both spacious including the rooms for individuals who need wheelchairs. I need to mention the waiting staff allehandra and the other staff including the reception girls. Thank you for your warm welcome and excellent hospitality. ",5,2023,02,06
243,"Clean & modern, but room for improvement","A very modern and fairly new hotel, but lacking in that personal touch. 
On arrival you check yourself in on a touchscreen with a member of staff hovering in the background who then tells you stuff whilst you walk to the lift 🤷🏻‍♂️. A friendly check in desk would be much more welcoming. 
The lobby is clean and modern with plenty of space to relax or work. 

The room on entering seemed to be very nice and modern, yet small. 
The unnecessarily huge bed is across the whole end of the room meaning access is only from one side. Crawling over each other to get into and out of bed is a bit of a faff. 
Whilst you get 3 fixed hangers and some coat hooks, you don’t get any clothes storage in the way of a wardrobe or drawers. 
There are NO tea and coffee making facilities in the room which is very disappointing. 
The very small toilet and shower room is functional and clean. It is accessed through an opaque glass door from the main room. 
Lighting - there are 2 switches by the door and the bed controlling the 2 stages of lights in the room. Options are ‘bright’ and ‘super bright’. There is no bedside reading light, meaning the room is either bright of dark. This is very annoying. 
Also, the toilet light is on a sensor which is set to stay on for much longer than needed once you’ve left the room. Seemingly 20 mins!!  With the opaque door, this illuminates the room at night with no way of switching it off. 

There are no views to speak of out of the windows as such, so my advise would be to ask for an internal room, you are much more likely to have a good nights sleep without the thumping music from neighbouring pubs/clubs keeping you awake.",3,2023,01,30
243,Fantastic Stout,"Booked the hotel the night before our 2 night stay. Very new modern hotel with fantastic facilities. Big reception and bar areas with plenty of tea & coffee facilities. The location is fantastic all be it’s little set back and hidden of the main hub. Hotel recommended car park is opposite the hotel entrance a tad expensive for parking at €50 for 2 days but the room rate was good. Great Guinness at the bar full bodied pint really cream from settling to finish it was 10/10 👍
Our room was accessible which had more room than the mod pods for an extra €20 a night worth it. Will definitely return very soon",5,2023,01,26
243,Perfect for child-free short stays,"The room is perfect for short stay, no fuss, with everything you could need.
It's small with a king size bed, but if you come to Dublin why would you want to stay in the room.
Check-in and out was effortless, and the staff are helpful.",5,2023,01,26
243,Marlin Hotel,"Great hotel, great service would highly recommended. Restaurant great to eat in, great service. Excellent rooms. Excellent location. Great value for money. Will book this hotel again, loved staying there. ",5,2023,01,25
243,lovely central hotel,"Lovely hotel with friendly and helpful staff. The room was clean and tidy throughout, however there were no tea making facilities but there was a coffee cart in the lobby which did good coffee. the hotel also has a good bar that is open until late and has sky football/sport to enjoy.
the hotel is just off Aungier St which has plenty of buses to get you into central Dublin which is literally 10 mins away. In truth we tended to walk into Dublin stopping off the many friendly inns along the way, of note is the Lucky Duck and thomas moore's among others.",5,2023,01,24
243,Great experience!,"We stayed in this hotel for only 1 night and that was amazing! Really nice room, amazing staff (especially bartenders), and the best scrambled eggs for breakfast! Loved it, will definitely stay here next time we’re in Dublin:)",5,2023,01,23
243,Perfect hotel and service!,"We had the best experience of this hotel!
My fiancée contact a staff member named Marcelo and Humberto and they prepared a wonderful and so surprised moment for us! Our hotel room was covered in flowers, candles, chockolate and prosecco! (See following photos)
We highly recommend this service for all couples!
Perfect hotel, nice food, great location and great service!
Thank you all for everything!
Best regards from Iceland,
Vala & Simmi",5,2023,01,23
243,What has happened to this Hotel?,"I have stayed here a few times since it opened. 
So disappointed this visit. 
The once fabulous breakfast in the fabulous room with fireplace and ambient lighting is no more . 
A basic buffet breakfast in the bar area. The standards have dropped. 
The Photo Booth is now just a prop. 
The service in the bar is poor and the atmosphere is flat and dull. 
The once totally blackout blinds in the cosy room didn’t quite close all the way. 
The under light in the bathroom kept waking me up as it made the room too bright and it doesn’t turn off. 
The air con kept resetting itself to 22degrees when I wanted it at 18 as the room was very warm
And stuffy. 
The only thing that has stayed the same is the fabulous bed that is amazing to
Sleep in. But what’s the deal with the two weird bumpy pillows ??? 
I had booked dinner but when I realised it was in the bar ( not what I thought I was booking) and had restaurant prices and slow service , I left and got dinner in a restaurant in town. 
It feels to me like a hotel that has dropped its once high standards that made me keep going back . 
The TV had  no chrome cast working as advertised and I was offered a different room but I declined as I was only staying one night. 
I hope to see one day the Marlin  go back to its original standard .  It was once a gem. The atmosphere is now very flat and dull.",2,2023,01,22
243,Love this hotel,"This hotel is stunning, beds are so comfortable, shower lovely and hot. The restaurant food is amazing! I will definitely stay here again. The only thing I would have liked is daily house keeping not every two days as I like the bed made and fresh dry towels. But that’s a very small niggle ",5,2023,01,17
243,Great Weekend,"Great Hotel, Lovely design and decor. Room was perfect. Staff are the best. Easy check in and checkout. Definitely would go back. Good location close to all the shops and Luas line. Breakfast is easy self service and delicious. ",5,2023,01,17
243,Recommended!,"The (standard) room was a little smaller than I'd expected, but it was still perfectly OK for me travelling alone on a business trip. The hotel is lovely; lobby, bar, etc. beautifully decorated and comfortable to work or realx in. Really clean rooms / bathroom, everything felt new; service was excellent (reception, housekeeping, dry-cleaning), free wi-fi was reliable and the staff are very friendly and helpful. I'd definitely stay here agin - many thanks!",5,2023,01,15
243,Yan ,"Marlin Hotel was an absolutely fantatsic stay. From first class staff to a cosy double room with the biggest bed you could wish for and en suite which was cleaned every single day. I would definitely stay here again. Modern, great facilities with a coffee shop on the ground floor too! 👌 😀 ",5,2023,01,11
243,Short stay,"Loved our stay in the marlin. It was just one night but myself and my girlfriend loved it and will definitely come back again.
The hotel is very modern and funky. Different to any hotel you have seen before.
The rooms are a bit small so suit 1 or 2 people only, the beds are amazing.  The room was probably overpriced if I'm being honest. 170 euro for one night but hotels in general are gone pricey 
The staff were very friendly ( its a self check in/out
The restaurant on site has a great menu at reasonable prices.
The location of the hotel is a plus point for sure. 2 minutes walk to Stephens green shoping center and grafton steet. 

Over all loved our stay and we will definitely be back again ",4,2023,01,09
243,Perfect location. Very friendly staff too.,The problem with our room was a shower leak. So the carpet for very wet and the room smelled like musty carpet. We did change rooms. When we asked to switch they did accommodate us. The room was just down the hall. ,4,2023,01,05
243,"Not good value , small tiny room it was a surreal experience to say the least","Staying in our room 2x4 small is an understatement, at £200 per night with NO breakfast included in the price.

The room just fit a double bed and no room to swing a cat more like a broom closet .
Maybe it’s a Japanese pod idea but certainly 
Will not be staying here again ,

Staff very helpful, location great that’s it and Netflix",1,2023,01,04
243,Nice hotel,"Hotel was very nice. Good service and the food was very good. And the bar was very good. We all liked the hotel very much. 
We will definitely come back to this hotel next time. ……………
We were 4 people and to rooms and we were all happy about the stay. Rooms are bit small but it was alright for us. ",5,2023,01,04
243,Great location.  Lacks better rating due to staff and amenities issues,"The hotel is in a great location.  If you rented a vehicle, there is a Car Park across the street.  The staff was pleasant, but some did not understand English very well.  Housekeeping walked right into my room without knocking, not once, but twice.  Repeatedly had to ask for the coffee to be replenished and never received the milk/cream to go with the coffee or tea after repeatedly asking.  Guess it depends on how much you spend the room or which one you reserve.  I will most likely not stay at this location again even though I did enjoy where it was located.",3,2023,01,03
243,Newyears Eve stay,"Food was lovely 
Staff very friendly, especially staff in the bar. 
Room size below average but not a shoe box 
Checkin service was brilliant (just like been at an airport kiosk) 
1min walk from Stephen’s green. ",4,2023,01,02
243,Great location!,"Cool mod hotel right next to Stephen’s Green, Grafton St, shops and pubs. Great bar and restaurant. Fab breakfast buffet. All kinds of well-designed spaces. Will defo stay again. Helpful staff and friendly waiters. ",5,2023,01,02
243,great hotel,"fab location right near all the shops bars and restaurants
spotlessly clean 
staff super welcoming and helpful / bed was so comfortable
funky cool feel 
would stay again  - only draw back no parking - though there is a car park across the road",5,2023,01,01
243,Overpriced,"Lovely new hotel, great location. Rooms are nice but very small. Basically size of your double or king bed maybe why it’s called the cosy king.. Great for a quick overnight where you don’t need to stay in the room, but for anything more it’s overpriced ",3,2022,12,31
243,Great Dublin location!,"The location of this hotel is fabulous for exploring the city. One direction is Georgian Dublin, the other is bustling Grafton St and shopping. 
The rooms are large and well planned.The beds are large and super comfortable, but my only negative is the pillows are very hard and high off the bed! ",5,2022,12,30
243,Christmas treat,"Stayed here for a pan to visit with our family; great location - just around the corner.  Lovely, welcoming atmosphere and very easy self check-in. Fabulous room, clean and comfortable.  Very helpful with our bags the next morning after check out, and with an unwell toddler to get our bag back as well! ",5,2022,12,29
243,Great hotel for a city break in Dublin,"Fantastic Central location, modern clean rooms, tasty breakfast, L’occtaine toiletries, international visitors very welcome, young and helpful staff. Reliant on modern e-commerce methods to run a hotel. No parking at the hotel but car park across the street. Suits a city break for a few nights. We were charged for getting the room early, unnecessary as it was ready.",4,2022,12,28
243,Very happy,Very content with everything. The room was clean and welcoming. I had a client meeting and we agreed to stay behind and have the meeting in the lobby area followed by lunch. Lunch was excellent. Thank you very much.,5,2022,12,28
243,Central and functional,Hotel centrally located  stern back of St Stephen’s green car park and local high rise flats. I have felt safer walking back at night to other hotels. Food lovely and bar staff highly efficient and friendly. The rooms are not huge but do the job. The self serve check in and check out was unique and useful if in a hurry but impersonal if on special weekend away! Happy to go back for business trip. ,3,2022,12,23
243,Wonderful,"Wonderful place to stay. Very friendly staff, clean, and great breakfast. The location is within walking distance of all the highlights  to see in Dublin. We are in our 60s and found it an easy walk to Phoenix Park, The Guinness Storehouse and the public transport.",5,2022,12,21
243,Xmas Party Night,"Very Good, Staff were very helpful, good location, just off Stephens Green, close to resaturants, bars, shopping. Rooms were simple and clean. Could have done with an Iron, but otherwise no issues.
Electronic check-in is handy, staff on hand to help if you get stuck, quick easy check out in the morning.",4,2022,12,19
243,Thanks for such a lovely city stay,"My week in their hotel was incredibly pleasant, breakfast buffet was fresh and delicious every day, the location has been ideal for many beautiful excursions on foot and in the bar the service from our waiter was very good, food has of course also tasted excellent.",5,2022,12,17
243,A pleasant surprise,"We found your hotel online. We booked it for it's location, reviews and price point. Once we found it on the off beaten path, we were beyond pleased. The service and accommodations were top notch. I highly recommend staying here.",5,2022,12,17
243,Gorgeous hotel in the heart of Dublin,"Very modern and contemporary hotel in the heart of Dublin. Very helpful staff and exceptionally quiet inside given that its in the centre of Dublin. Great for parking, shopping, eating out. Huge very comfy bed with very cosy bed linen. Only thing to note when booking is that one side of the bed is against he wall so access with two in the bed is from one side! ",5,2022,12,14
243,shocking,"Dear duty manager 

Thanks for not caring 

Not even an apology 

A suggestion 

Think about what you are saying 

Your hotel is for students 

Simple as that 

However thank you for replying 

Regards 

Eamon and Ursula 

Not even a phone call",1,2022,12,14
243,Awesome hotel in an awesome city,"Location is excellent. Staff is excellent, although I forgot to ask a person at the reception for her name. But wonderful enthusiasm, she even remembered when I called to book my stay weeks ago. Room is a bit of a strange design for a Canadian but very modern, space efficient, clean, impecable pillows, and heat. Breakfast in the morning top notch. ",5,2022,12,13
243,"Decent, for the Price","This is a no frills, affordable hotel. The location is excellent.  It was clean.  The self-service check-in kiosk didn't work for us, but not sure it works for others either.  Rooms are small but clean, the bed wasn't terribly comfortable.",3,2022,12,13
243,Central by room extremely small,"Central hotel close to the Dublin city south. When booking avoid the cosy king as it is fit for one person only and not for long stays. The room is perfectly clean and functional, but lack facilities such as tea/coffee or basics hotel info ( not shared on the TV like other hotels) ",3,2022,12,12
243,Very Disappointing,Stayed at this hotel to celebrate a wedding anniversary and was extremely disappointed. Great location but that’s it .Had a drink in the bar on arrival to be charged €19.80 for two drinks-glass of house wine €12 and 7.80 for a pint of Heineken. Checked into the room which was absolutely tiny even though we had paid extra for an upgrade.During the night the toilet started leaking into cistern which resulted in water cascading into the toilet !! Finally after being kept awake with the noise and unable to sleep-I contacted reception an hour later we moved to a room across the hall at 2am - We moved to the other room immediately to get some sleep.At 730 am that morning a member of staff walked into the room to inquire if we needed room service- I quickly declined the offer only to return 30 minutes later!! Tired and weary at this stage we returned to our original room to collect our belongings and check out . I went to reception to state my disappointment and frustration- I got a shrug of the shoulders and a apology and the offer of a free breakfast for our inconvenience! Very disappointing for a 4star city centre hotel - I did email the general manager about our stay and he too offered a free breakfast next time we stay!In my fifty’s and have stayed in many hotels all over the world ! This is the worst by far .,1,2022,12,11
243,Worst hotel,"Worst 

I have to say the worst hotel room in the world 

So if one. Is sleeping beside the window 

A person has to wake the other person up to go to the bathroom 

And if you leave blind up everyone can see in from the apartment s or flats next door 

Heating doesn’t work 

Television remote didn’t work 

Unbelievable 

And no one on the front desk to talk to",1,2022,12,10
243,Avoid. Avoid. Avoid.,"Avoid at all costs!!!! Possibly the worst hotel I’ve ever stayed in. I presume my room used to be a storage space, the bed just about fit. The self service check in system doesn’t work, had to go through it twice and still had to check in at the desk. Shambles.",1,2022,12,10
243,Nice Hotel 👌,"room clean but not add water and shower gel  and shampoo every day i must call him before to added , staff Very helpful , good location , check in must to be at 3 pm only I don’t know why !! at all nice accommodation ",4,2022,12,08
243,Thank you,"Thank you for the service and hostility. Much appreciated.
The review requires 200 min characters. This is the only change I propose as no one has time to write that much when they do reviews. Thank you

243,Very enjoyable stay,"Centrally located hotel with a very warm welcoming reception staff , lovely practical hotel with everything one would need, would happily recommend to anyone visiting Dublin and I will be back to stay soon ",5,2022,12,06
243,Double charged worst ever,"worst experience ever. 
Their duty manager refused to provide any evidence of a double-charged payment.
I provided bank statements and other questions they asked.
The problem is their self-check-in service. Worst ever. They don't even have a normal card machine.",1,2022,12,05
243,Excellent hotel everything beside your hotel,"Very very good location 
Everything besides your hotel ( shopping mall Resturant and cleaning shop )
Very friendly and helpful staff 
The breakfast is amazing 
Cleaning is fantastic 
There is laundry machine to clean your clothes 
I 100% recommend this hotel ",5,2022,12,05

243,"Beautyful mew hotel, great location","Stayed 2 nights. Fantastic location, beautyful new hotel.
Ignorant staff. Forced to check in at a self Check in desk which didn't work. Really anoing and for me reason not to return. 
Great bed, slall but clean room. ",3,2022,12,05
243,Excellent hotel in central location.,"Small rooms but fine if you just want a place to rest your head. Perfect location, clean and modern. Breakfast looked nice though we didn’t have it. Nice reception area with coffee kiosk. Easy check in and check out.",4,2022,12,04
243,Perfectly decent but not as refined as it thinks it is,"Stayed here for one night for a business trip.

When I arrived the automatic check-in wasn’t working so they had a temporary setup in the foyer. I couldn’t get a receipt so was told I could get that at checkout.

The room was small but perfectly adequate. The tv looked over the bed (which was fitted into the space by the window and only one side is available to get in or out - beware!)

Strangely for a modern hotel there was an ironing room rather than an iron IN the room which isn’t so convenient when you have a hectic schedule.

Checkout the next dia via the automatic checkout didn’t yield a receipt (surely it could have an option for you to have it emailed?) so I had to queue to get one.

I’d also been signposted to breakfast only to be told I wasn’t on the list. I couldn’t remember what the booking included so advising correctly at check-in would be helpful.

So a perfectly ok stay but the overall impression is of a hotel that wants to be 4 star but really isn’t.

243,Shocking,"We have booked 2 ‘cozy’ king rooms at the hotel for 3 nights at a cost of almost €750 per couple.  The e-check in is laborious to say the least but, having eventually collected our room keys, we made our way to the 5th floor.
We were shocked to see that both small rooms contained a large bed that enclosed by walls on 3 sides - essentially like a caravan and meaning that one person literally has to climb over the other to get out of bed.
There are no drawers in the room except a divan type bedding drawer under the bed.  There is no wardrobe and only 3 coat hangers on a bar against the wall.
One of our party had a recently sustained broken arm and cracked ribs so we returned to reception to ask if, for one couple at least, the enclosed bed situation could be rectified.  The staff member told us there were no alternative rooms and that pictures of the ‘cozy’ rooms were on the booking site - he knew this ‘because we have checked recently’ - I presume after other unhappy guests!
We decided to put the disappointment down to experience and enjoy the city - but we did need more than 3 coat hangers.
Before we left for dinner I asked a different staff member if someone could please provide more hangers for the room. I was told he would speak to housekeeping but if I wanted coat hangers there was a Dunnes store nearby where I could buy some!!!  
I have never, ever, had such shocking service - this is a 4 star hotel and costs €250 per couple per night.
Shame on them.
Please think very carefully before you book!",1,2022,12,02
243,Really cool hotel,"Excellent hotel, great value for money and right in the centre of Dublin. I found the hotel stylish and the breakfast was also great. I would certainly stay again if I am going back to Dublin. Highly recommended",5,2022,12,01
243,Great Service!,"Great service by Marcelo. My travel schedule resulted in a really early check in and he went out of my way to ensure I could get some rest.

Very convenient location next to all of the shopping of downtown and the best restaurants. I’ll definitely stay here again.",5,2022,12,01
243,"Excellent, a must stay","This hotel is a must stay if you’re looking for a nice hotel in a prime location in dublin, right off Stephen’s Green a very handy location and for a great price, such friendly helpful staff and the room was amazing comfiest hotel bed and pillows and a lovely shower, the bar is also great, cannot recommend this hotel enough ",5,2022,11,30
243,Great stay!,"Lovely place to stay. Easy to find, convenient self check in. Staff kept our bags until we were ready to check in. Room was clean, really comfy beds and overall pleasant stay!  We would definitly stay here again. ",5,2022,11,27
243,Friends meet up,"Perfect location and buzzy atmosphere with excellent quality rooms - we stayed in a suite as there was three of us - loads of space and very well equipped. Great noise reduction which was a plus for city centre location 
Great breakfast in funky bar in keeping with cool foyer.",5,2022,11,27
243,Brilliant city stay hotel,"Brilliant hotel room. For the price I wasn't expecting much  but only wanted somewhere to lay my head for a night. Check in service was really easy and always a number of staff on hand to assist if any issues. Reception area is lovely and a lot of seating, that all seems very cosy and secluded. 
I booked cheapest room and it was small but perfect for my stay. The bed was the better then my own bed. I would check in again just for the bed, a big struggle to get out of it in the morning. 
Bathroom was small but lovely lighting and ideal for my stay. 
Highly recommended to anyone looking for city stay and wants to be close to the city. 2 mins walk and I was on Grafton Street. ",5,2022,11,27
243,Great hotel,"Great stay but the room was roasting in November!☀️🔥Service, Bar, Breakfast all as good as you'd expect from a smart hotel. Location is great and atmosphere is laid back. Only sore point is the temperature of the rooms, way too hot due to south facing fixed glazing. Aircon just not strong enough to cope.",4,2022,11,25
243,Awesome stay!,Staff was friendly from check-in to check-out. Hotel was clean. Bed very comfortable and nice darkening curtains in room. Breakfast excellent!  Nice toiletries provided. Location is perfect - walking distance to most all attractions. Great stay! ,5,2022,11,25
243,Expensive and not worthy,"Sockets, telephone, light from the bathroom, shower vet/extractor were not working. I asked to have it checked, but nobody did it. No hairdryer inside the room. Hair in the towels. Noise during the night. ",3,2022,11,25
243,Smallest bedroom ever stayed in..for price expected so much more,So disappointed with the room..was so so small .expected  so much more for the price charged! 2 people couldn’t pass other in the room ..would have to stand back at side of the bed. So little space even for clothing . No spa ce in room to sit and relax ..for this reason alone wouldn’t stay again ,3,2022,11,25
243,Perfect City Centre Location,"Perfect location for City Centre Business and Nights out.
Self service checking was easy and simple.

243,Great base for Dublin city,"Stayed for a few days with friends. Standard excellent from the helpfulness of all staff , decor very modern and loved some of the quirkiness. The photo booth was a big hit within our group and gave us many laughs. Great location for the centre of Dublin. The room was good, clean, thank you housekeeping. We were on the 5th floor and some of our friends on the 1st floor, no noise from other doors etc and so very quiet enabling a good nights sleep. The bar was relaxing. We had the breakfast for two days and it was of excellent standard , could
not fault it, excellent choice and catered for everyone. You may think it’s expensive but having had breakfast in Dublin town it was on par and maybe better. Would definitely stay again.",5,2022,11,22
243,Great stay!,"Great stay, comfy bed, with good shower. Rooms aren't huge but has enough space. The staff are friendly and helpful, eith nothing too much trouble. The breakfast was very good quality and great choice of alternatives also, brilliant coffee!",5,2022,11,18
243,You'll love it... or not... ,"Just reading the reviews you'll understand that people either love the Marlin, or have issues with it... My overall experience was positive.. I was a single traveller on business in a Cosy King room. Absolutely fine for me, although even with just my modest needs, I did find having only three hangers a bit limiting... I'm not sure I'd have been quite so happy with the room if it had been two of us, for all the reasons others have mentioned. The common areas on the ground floor are really inspired... I loved it. Breakfast was fine, an evening meal was also good, but I did feel that bar prices for drinks were a bit high.

Would I go back? Probably not... The reason? No tea or coffee facilities in-room, which seems a strange omission given the investment in other tech in the rooms. I need my morning cup of tea, not a glass of water... ",4,2022,11,13
243,Funky hotel - needs to improve on cleaning standards ,"The hotel is located very close to St Stephen's Green, and very accessible.  It is well decorated and to a high standard.  There is supposed to be self-check in- but that did not work for me, and we had to get assistance and it took over 20 mins to complete.  The main issue I had was cleanliness.  We were given an accessible bathroom, and the tiles on the shower floor were covered in mold.  Under the sheet, the bed protector cover was covered in hair.  The next morning I mentioned this at check out, and the receptionist said they would look into it.  When I came back for my bag 2 hours later, it was not mentioned to me.  I booked my room via Hotels.com and the review function was not available to me.  ",3,2022,11,07
243,Curate's Egg of a hotel - Good in parts,"Firstly the Marlin Hotel is in a great location and is modern and very clean. I stayed two nights, Tuesday and Thursday as I was elsewhere in the country on the Wednesday. This meant I had to check in twice using their Self Check in system. Wouldn't recognise my name or booking on both times and had to get assistance from the very friendly staff. Wouldn't allow me to check out either. Loathe these things as I believe that after a crappy journey I want to be welcomed by the friendly, smiling face of a real person not some soulless machine. I stayed in a 'Cosy Room'. Spotlessly clean but the first hotel room I've ever stayed in with no tea or coffee making facilities. A big no no for me. The bed was huge and took the whole of one end of the room with the mattress touching all three walls. TV mounted above the bed. If you're sleeping on your own it's fine but if you're part of a couple one would have to climb over the other to get out. The bed is big enough to sleep at any angle though so after watching telly you both could shuffle through 90 degrees and then have to scoot your way down the bed to get out. There was no wardrobe but there was a rack on the wall with three coat pegs and three hangers underneath. Nowhere near enough hanging space if you're there for more than one night. There were lights under the sink which I was unable to turn off and this, together with the glass door of the bathroom meant the room wasn't dark enough for me to sleep well. Food and alcohol was good and seemed reasonably well priced for Dublin. There are lots of places in the lounge where you can work on your laptop with power points and USB slots and the wi-fi was never an issue. Overall if you're staying the one night on your own and have minimal luggage the hotel is a good place to stay. Lots of bars and restaurants nearby and centrally located. Staff were very friendly and the one issue I did have where they brought me a glass of wine with my meal instead of the bottle I ordered and then brought the wrong bottle was quickly sorted with fulsome apologies. Simple Human error sorted out with minimal fuss. The rest of the wait staff were very good and service at the bar was prompt. ",3,2022,11,07
243,Location is just not enough,"Basic room facilities, I’m an adult!
I want a cooler with drinks within, snacks within room.
It just felt grim.
Cocktails at the bar were tasteless.
Shower head and pressure was terrible.
“Gym” equipment is limited and the room is depressing.",3,2022,11,03
243,Rude and unhelpful,"Check in machines were broken over 20 people waiting to check in but wouldn't let us as they refused cash!! That's illegal! Had to wait 40mins for their machines to be fixed!
Paid for a deluxe room got a disabled one still nice room tho.
Everything from ordering a drink to lunch to dinner in the bar was a disgrace waiting 30mins for our lunch items spoken rudely to by staff, speaking their own language while we're ordering and then they laughed a few other people in the bar complained about that!
Stayed for the marathon as two people with us were running in it, they didn't have a decent breakfast out on for the runners as there was numerous of them staying, went to charge one person 17 euro for porridge even tho that's the full breakfast rate had to pay 10 before they would let him out of the room! Wouldn't let my sister just have toast said she had 5euro cash on her they refused that too said 17euro even if its just toast! I've never stayed in a place near an event that didn't actually cater to the event! Lady in the bar with blonde hair was brilliant she looked like a manager literally spent her whole day clearing up after the staff and apologising for them! So many people complained that night about the staff and the wait times for food, 55mins for a started that ended up coming out with the mains! The place is very poorly run! Staff either don't understand English or don't care too especially when you need help! They kept ringing my sisters room (gave her a disabled room when she booked superior) saying she's let off the alarm it was 2.30 in the morning no alarm was let off they came to check it and couldn't see the fault even tho she rang hours prior saying the light outside has turned red incase that is showing an alarm or something everything is fine hours later 3 phones calls and 2 calls to the room the problem still wasn't fixed!! And yet they still refused her toast after all that! Will never go there again! ",1,2022,11,01
243,Great modern hotel but service not up to scratch,"Very modern clean hotel in great location however in both of the two rooms I booked the TV wouldn’t work, reception sent someone to one room with a new remote but it still wouldn’t work, no one came to second room. For the price the least I’d expect is for a working TV, when informed at check out staff didn’t seem to care. ",3,2022,10,31
243,Perfect stay,"I stayed one night in the Marlin. Check in and check out were very smooth. The room was fantastic overall - excellent mattress, bathroom very new and shiny and great tv over the bed. The staff are all very friendly. I will definitely go back. I really like boutique hotels and I loved the quirky vibe in this one. ",5,2022,10,28
243,Really really cosy modern room,"Only downfall was no kettle or coffee in room breakfast was really nice snd all food was fresh . 
Really quirky feel coming g into the hotel safety in hotel is amazing location is perfect for city staying near all shops if your looking to do bit of shopping ",4,2022,10,25
243,"Perfect location, lovely atmosphere","A quick work trip to Dublin, so this was a perfect location for me. Parking is just across the streeet with a validated ticket for 24 hours. Beds and shower were 10/10. Rooms are spotless and efficient. I would definitely return to the marlin 
",5,2022,10,17
243,Great city centre hotel,"Perfectly located in the centre of Dublin. Great amenities, lovely comfortable rooms and friendly staff. Only cons are breakfast is a bit pricey €17, you can find a much nicer breakfast in a restaurant nearby for less, the room is on the smaller side and housekeeping is only every other day not daily. But I would stay again and recommend to a friend. ",5,2022,10,15
243,Shocking Bedroom,"I booked a Cosy King room for my husband and I.  “ King” suggested adequate space.  The bed was against the walls on 3 sides . It was a 6ft wide bed. Therefore for the second person to get in bed it meant clambering over the bed - with difficulty.  The worst thing was that there was no light switch for the person on the inside. This  was terrible in the middle of the night - trying to get out was so difficult.  As I like to read  but my husband doesn’t  I had to wake him to turn off the light. I have never experienced such poor facilities in a hotel.   On bringing this to the attention of the Receptionist in the morning her reply was. “ You should have booked a larger room “  She seemed unaware that the configuration of the room is not apparent on the booking form.  Neither was she in the slightest bit interested.    Surprisingly there was no tea making facility in the room - a pretty normal convenience in most hotels. 

We dined in the hotel and the meal was excellent and the staff members were very courteous.  Sadly the accommodation was disastrous.",1,2022,10,14
243,Ideal stay,Very good stay. Unique hotel which is very modern and futuristic. Food was very nice and operationally a brilliant hotel. All staff were great and could not be faulted. Thank you for a great stay! Will,5,2022,10,14
243,"Clean, modern, comfortable - all in a great location!","This a clean, modern, well-maintained hotel in the best possible location for guests who want to be able to walk to everything!  Yes, the rooms are smaller than Americans are used to, but they are very comfortable and all of the information about the way the rooms are configured is easily discernible from the photos on the hotel website.  The rates are not cheap, but they are in keeping with the nicer hotels in Dublin, and the breakfast buffet was extensive, fresh, and well-prepared.  The staff in the reception was helpful when needed and housekeeping maintained our room every day, although the information we received at check-in said that housekeeping would be every other day unless otherwise requested.  We enjoyed our week-long stay very much and as comfortable as everything was, the best thing was the location.  It simply couldn't be better - shopping, restaurants, sights - everything right near by.",5,2022,10,13
243,Nice new hotel but expensive,"Great location and everything was new and modern. Comfortable beds, easy self-checkin and really nice decor.

Like all Dublin hotels, however, it was expensive (both in terms of accommodation and food and drink). I enjoyed the stay. There were no fault, but I didn't feel it was worth the price I paid. I basically just slept there and had 1 drink in the bar.",4,2022,10,10
243,"Be advised, not a ‘traditional’ four star hotel!","In my opinion the Marlin hotel is more like a very fancy hostel than a traditional four star hotel. That comes as a bit of a surprise if you are not expecting it! On the plus side it’s very clean, very unique style, friendly staff and relaxed atmosphere. The cons are that the king rooms are just too small for two people. Travellers with a lot of luggage will struggle. The breakfast was average for the price. The dining option is bar food only. The high price tag is for the excellent location, not the accommodation. We did really enjoy our stay but would consider other options with more spacious rooms for our next stay in Dublin City centre. ",3,2022,10,09
243,Thank you 😊 ,"The hotel is very well situated and the facilities are all quite new. Staff at the bar is extremely helpful, special shoutout to the night receptionist Sorin who was kind and helpful.

243,"Tiny room, noisy guests, had several problems ","Please read the recent reviews. Cannot recommend this hotel based on our experience. We were given a “cozy king” room which as others note is tiny (like a dorm room, does not work for a couple); were told no others were available though offered to pay to upgrade. Had to ask 3 times for replacement towels. Spent 30 mins to check in because there was confusion over our prepayment. Undersink light did not go out for more than an hour which was a big problem in such a small room. Last straw was guests being noisy until 2:30 am in courtyard and other rooms. Only plus was the location. Had an otherwise great time in Dublin but would never stay here again. We travel a ton and I’ve never had cause to post such negative review. ",2,2022,10,07
243,Have started legal action against them their hotel so bad,"I paid £1500 for a 'Premium Room' for 4 nights only to be given a mattress under a window and told nothing else is available as ""we are busy""

I refused the room, and they, to date they have not given me a refund. Their excuse? Was booking.com's fault not ours. Just in case there is any doubt, Marlin themselves charged my card at the front desk NOT booking.com 

PS. They also called the police rather than deal with the situation. Vile cowardly staff that are nothing more than robots programmed to extract money above all else.",1,2022,10,03
243,Worst experience in a hotel ever!,"To whom it concerns,

In all honesty this was the worst experience myself and my husband have ever had in a hotel.  

We were woken up 5/6 times from an alarm in the room.  We were told it was in case oxygen ran out in the room!? I am sorry to say the staff did not deal with the situation well and gave a half hearted apology and no real explanation as to why it kept off. 

It is near town but for the price you pay the rooms are tiny and no window that opens. 
In my opinion not worth the money.  Do check about the alarm if you do decide to stay here.",1,2022,09,30
243,Good location but lacking,"An expensive two nightstay, we presume because of the central location. Check in process via a machine ok, with someone on hand to help. The four check in screens could be placed a bit further apart to give a bit more space and privacy. Parking paid for at the hotel with no clear instructions at the car park on what to do with the discount ticket. Hotel staff could have advised us rather than leaving us to call the car park staff for help.
The room was clean and the bed comfortable, however it was very basic indeed. No coffee making facilities which these days is very unusual. You can go and buy a coffee in the lobby. The bed was jammed in on three sides so one person needs to climb over the other to get out. No towel rail and an opaque bathroom door.
Good choice at breakfast but cooked food was lukewarm. Breakfast staff were friendly and helpful. On a par with Premier Inn.
From reading other reviews I am glad we didn't stay at a weekend when noise from clubs can be an issue. It was very quiet which was nice.",3,2022,09,30
243,Beware the Cozy King!!,"The Pros:  Great location, near Grafton St and St Stephen’s Green. The hotel restaurant was good for breakfast and we even ate there for dinner one night.  The hotel rooms are very clean and in good condition. 

The Cons: Be prepared if you book the “cozy king” which is their standard room.  The room is tiny and the king bed is walled in on three sides.  If you need to get up and pee in the middle of the night, you have to climb over the other person!  We were not prepared for this - would never stay here again!",2,2022,09,29
243,Avoid this hotel!,"One of my worst hotel experiences ever. We arranged for early check-in when we made the reservation only to discover that they charged for this when we arrived. But more shocking was the hotel room itself. My college dorm was palatial in comparison. Absolutely no space whatsoever. The bed was shoved flush against the window and we had three hangers stuck to the wall and a small drawer under the bed for storage. We had to chase down housekeeping on our floor to get towels, soap, etc. because our calls to the front desk were fruitless. Efforts to resolve our non-working TV were pointless as reception chose to simply hang up on us rather than offer a reasonable accommodation. The shower leaked out into the hotel room because the design was so poor and, not surprisingly, the bathroom was so tiny. Don’t be fooled by the lobby which is lovely. This hotel is simply dreadful.",1,2022,09,29
243,Great Central hotel,"Staff were excellent, nothing was to much trouble for them. Within easy walking distance of shops and restaurants. Good breakfast included. Very juice overall experience . Would stay here again. Very nice decor, very quirky !
",5,2022,09,25
243,Modern concept - Minimalistic lacking basic hospitality,"Marlin hotel has a modern concept and a good design but misses the basic of hospitality and everything comes for a price, more like make your own pizza. Starting from amenities for €400 a night, I got a room with no Coffee Kettle, was told it comes at an extra cost (What ?, I see this is a standard nowadays the worst hotels offer this). The bed fits in the room like a lego piece - stuck to walls on three sides, minimum room to move, cupboard is the drawer under the bed. Bathroom has frosted door you can see the silhouette of the person in the mirror while lying on the bed. There are separate ironing rooms on two floors. The irons are broken to an extent that the wires are exposed, are hazardous and unusable. I checked this on two floors. They have a laundry room with 3 washers and dryers and can be used by the guests. Self check in and check out at the kiosk but saw most of the time people struggle due to incorrect name captured at booking. I wrote and gave my name to the staff and yet it was captured wrong so they had to search for reservation number and check me in. Overall good property but there are better options at 50% the price in the vicinity. ",2,2022,09,24
243,Good central location; expensive but comfortable and quiet.,"Positives: Check in/out was easy. Parking as directly across the street. The room was comfortable and quiet.
Negative: The shower tray was filthy. Obtaining the discounted parking was VERY complicated.",4,2022,09,21
243,Over charged and underwhelmed,"We paid more than $300.00 for a college dorm room with a broken toilet seat. 
The room was too small for two people to relax comfortably after a long day of walking around Dublin. 

The staff couldn't care less about your needs. 
You get ONE towel. There is not even a free coffee in the morning. 
At over $300.00 a night - you'd expect a free coffee. 

I would never recommend this place to anyone. 
This place almost ruined our trip. 

Never again.",1,2022,09,18
243,You Won't Get Sleep Here ,"There is a night club very close to the hotel. It went on quite late on the weekend. I ask the reception guy about the loud music and looked at me like I should have known the hotel was on the boom radar of a night club
The room was very small, the bed went the whole way across, by the window. The building feels like it was not built as a hotel and was turned into one, so you can hear everything around.
I'm fairness it was clean.",1,2022,09,15
243,Shoe box room,"If you don’t require anything bigger than a shoebox, this will be ok. 2 people in rhos room was ridiculous. The king bed pretty much occupied something smaller than a school dorm room. You had to crawl over the other person if you were on the inside. One drawer under the bed was all you had to occupy one suitcase. Nowhere if you had two. 3 hangers on a coat hook to hang anything. One chair. Had to move that in front of the door to be able to get around. The bathroom was beyond small. Had to turn sideways to get out of the shower. Very little amenities. Not even a box of tissue. Will say it was very clean. Staff were not very helpful. One buffet staff was beyond rude and unhelpful. For the money, was a complete rip off.",2,2022,09,15
243,Trendy hotel in a super location but rooms are tiny,"Central location is the best feature of this hotel. Rooms are super small, beds are comfortable but locked in by 3 walls, so we switched the pillows and comforter orientation so that one person wouldn’t have to crawl over the other in the night. No coffee or tea in the rooms. Towels are plush but shower water will get everywhere because of the half door. Check-in was easy and there are helpful staff in the lobby. Pricey accommodations but maybe the location alone is worth the money.",4,2022,09,12
243,Tiny room,"Very very disappointed  with this hotel, of should II call  it a hostel, the room was so small with access for the bed from one side only, no wardrobe, for €299 with no breakfast this is ripoff Ireland at its best.",1,2022,09,08
243,Overnight in Dublin,The hotel was top-notch service and cleanliness.  Rooms were very comfortable and neat.  Parking was a bit tricky at first and only wish it was included (we did get a good discount though).  Would definitely go back.,5,2022,09,07
243,tiny room for 2 complete with loud music outside,If you want an extremely small room with outside noise this if for you.    The room is too small for more than one and certainly made for only a single night.  This was by far the worst hotel we stayed in during our 2 week stay in Ireland.,2,2022,09,05
243,Hotel for either corporate or short stay only,"First thing we were told (before hello/welcome) there was a 20 euro charge for early check which is a bit ridiculous. The hotel checks guests out at 11am also! And bar staff tend to charge mandatory tips at their leisure which when I brought it to managements attention, had no Idea. Positives though - Hotel/Room was very clean and breakfast was surprisingly good. I would 100% spend my money on a different hotel next time. ",2,2022,09,05
243,Nice stay but a few small issues,"The Marlin is a nice hotel in a great location.   We stayed for five days and enjoyed being located so close to everything.   There were three of us; two stayed in a suite and one in a basic room.

Pros:
The suite was large and nicely laid out.
The bathroom was huge and had a great shower (however, no facial tissues anywhere in the suite)
The restaurant was good.
There are many nice public spaces to sit and relax.

Cons:

We chose a suite mainly because we wanted a coffee maker in the room, as we had some very early morning tours where nothing would be open.   I contacted the hotel and was told there was a coffee maker in the suites only so we booked one; however, that wasn’t the case.  There was a kettle with instant coffee packets.   Not quite what I was looking for.   

The suite had a pull-out couch in the living room; however, we were limited to two people per suite - my sister had to book her own room.   This plus the suite with no coffee maker made the stay very expensive.  We should have just gotten two basic rooms.

We were told housekeeping would only come every other day - for that amount of money, I was a bit surprised but didn’t really care except that they only put one day’s worth of shampoo and coffee in the room so we had to ask for more.   Then, on our third day, we inexplicably had service again (maybe because we left a nice tip the night before).

The bathroom light is controlled by a motion sensor, which means that the light goes out while you are in the shower because the sensor doesn’t reach that area of the room.

There were very few staff visible in the lobby.   Often we would go by the front desk and no one was there (although staff usually came over from elsewhere in the room - it seemed like they were using the guest computers on the other side of the room.)

The self-check-in was a great idea; it worked for my sister but not for me and the gentleman from the front desk had a very hard time getting me checked in, for some reason.   He tried both the self check in and the reception desk computer.  Even with the booking number, there seemed to be issues.   It took about half an hour to get checked in.   The technology obviously has a few quirks.

The photo booth in the lobby seemed like a fun idea; however, it didn’t actually email us the photos; perhaps it’s just an email farming machine.   Not cool.

Overall, we had a nice stay at the Marlin, and I think I would felt more positive if my sister had been allowed to share our suite which had plenty of room; not sure why three people aren’t allowed to share a room.   In any case, if the price were right, I would probably stay there again.  The property is clean and comfortable, and the staff is friendly and helpful.",3,2022,08,31
243,"Clean and comfortable, great location!","We were pleasantly surprised with our week long stay at the Marlin Hotel. It is self check in at a kiosk but nice and friendly staff present to assist us. Fun and funky vibe in lobby and bar, very modern. Stayed in an Executive King room, it wasn’t fancy but it was plenty big enough for the 2 of us. Bigger than a lot of other European rooms we’ve stayed in, and had an iron, small refrigerator, and coffee maker.  Everything was very clean, comfortable bed with nice linens. Location was amazing, just south of Temple Bar. Very safe area and within walking distance to many of the places we wanted to visit. Breakfast buffet better than average, eggs-meats-cheeses-pastries, etc., great coffee too!  Zero complaints about out stay :)",4,2022,08,30
243,Good stay in Dublin city centre,We had a comfortable stay in the hotel. Its right in middle of city centre so very convenient. Public transport was just near by and car park was good value as well. Breakfast was really good and friendly staff,5,2022,08,30
243,Fantastic hotel,"Sad to say we only stayed here one night but it was a favourite of our trip. Our room was small but all we needed, really nice and the service was amazing. The kiosks for check in/out were convenient but I worried about if we needed something. No need, there were always staff around for any questions. I was bummed there was no hair dryer in the room but I asked at check-in (there was someone to help at the kiosks if needed) and it was delivered to the room right away, and was a great quality one. We had issues using the iron in the ironing room (maybe user error) but a staff member brought one within 2 minutes to our room. Overall would highly recommend, very attentive staff, highly quality rooms and good value. ",5,2022,08,28
243,Cool looking hotel and one gentleman at the front desk who was fantastic -  that is absolutely it,"Where to begin -  smallest rooms ever made and for travelers with bags, a total s**t show to maneuver.  3 hangers (total) no closet, but a wall with 3 hooks - I could cry it was so awful.  Service to say the very least was also awful.  Sadly I think they lost out on a ton of money - Huskers game, bartends that didn’t know how to make drinks (whiskey sour ..???what???) restaurant closed at 10:30.  Ireland was a great visit, The Marlin hotel is a hard pass, don’t waste your money.  Rated a 4 star, I’d say a 2 at best.",2,2022,08,27
243,Perfect hotel for our weekend in Dublin!,"Excellent location to reach all the sites, bars & restaurants on foot and very close to the tram, buses & train. Quirky hotel with great facilities. Very clean and room was an adequate size. We didn’t like the translucent glass door on the bathroom but that’s just personal choice! The room had a hug comfy bed with lovely pillows. It also had a safe but it wasn’t big enough to fit our laptop.",5,2022,08,26
243,Great rooms and location,"The Marlin is located close enough to be convenient but off the main road enough to be quiet. It is stylish, well maintained and well managed. The room was very comfortable, looked very contemporary and the bed was perfect. A trifecta! ",5,2022,08,23
243,Very clean but lacks warmth,"This is an ok one night stay, almost Japanese style from its auto check in and cold clinical small room. Very clean and functional. Good location and safe. Def nothing plush or warm here but I’ve never stayed anywhere as clean and efficient so that’s a big plus. Location is good too for all city centre activities.",4,2022,08,21
243,"Bad dryers, Blood on towels, but comfy bed","This review is written from the perspective of guests who stayed here explicitly because they had a self service washer and dryer. This was important for us since it was halfway between the start and end of our vacation, so we had no clean clothes left as soon as we reached this destination.

The bathrooms here were pretty gross and one of our towels was covered in blood.

We had a rough experience with the dryer. When we informed the front desk people their dryers did not work, they said a maintenance person would come by in the morning. This does us no good when our clothes are sopping wet from the washer,though. The lady in front of us was attempting to dry three garments for over 5 hours total, and it took us four hours to dry ours. This was only after we manually had to service the dryer - not replacing the lint filter, but cleaning out the air duct/filter in the bottom left corner (which should get replaced).
We stayed up extra late to ensure our clothes were dry and lost sleep as a result. 
",2,2022,08,19
243,Excellent hotel,"Beautiful hotel, lovely room, comfortable bed, friendly staff, delicious food at the restaurant, convient location, central, very clean. Will definitely try to stay here again. Highly recommend this hotel. ",5,2022,08,18
243,Definitely coming back!,"Very good service for a very short stay. They have a bunch of friendly and considerate staff as I came later than my friend, they were kind enough to give me a key to our room as my friend was out when I have arrived. After a long day out exploring Ireland, we came back to a clean and tidy room, new towels and new bottles of water. The reception area was so big and has a relaxing feel to it. I got out of the hotel before 4am and there is a staff already cleaning.
The hotel is near the city centre where you can easily get out on your feet if you want to experience the night life in Dublin.",5,2022,08,10
243,Can't fault the place,"Just returned from a trip to Dublin and this hotel is amazing! Literally nothing to complain about check in/out is so easy, room although small is completely adequate for a trip to the city comfortable bed breakfast was lovely and decor amazing! Good location for all attractions. Highly recommend for a trip to the city!",5,2022,08,07
243,Repeatedly ignored and dismissed by staff when I had a genuine issue with my room,"I booked this hotel to recover from a music festival, I mainly wanted to relax for the evening and watch tv in bed and I made sure that there was one before I booked. The TV did not work in my room and no-one working in the hotel seemed to give a damn, it was still not working when I checked out the next day. I called reception several times, I asked to move, they said ""no, they were working on it"", no-one called me back or came to my room, I called back 2 hours later and 2 hours again after that, same story. I went to speak to a manager, he gave me an info@marlin.ie email address to contact about the tv, no-one has responded to that email, 3 days later. I emailed the general manager, he hasn't responded. I spoke to a manager in the lift, he did nothing about it except to say that I should ""keep on trying the tv"". The staff were absolutely useless and I sat there in silence for the evening. Three days later, no-one has contacted me or responded to my emails, for €174, when the room was tiny, it's not good enough. If someone had said, I'm sorry, we can't fix it, let me give you breakfast on the house for the inconvenience, I would have been happy, instead... I am livid, because, I have contacted staff in various forms about 8 times ...and NO-ONE GAVE A DAMN",1,2022,08,03
243,"Not a hotel room, a closet space",We got to Dublin a few hours prior to check in.   Exhausted from Redeye.   We were told we could check in  if we were willing to pay an additional fee.  So rooms were available but they wanted to squeeze additional money from you.   We finally succumbed out of sheer frustration and exhaustion.   We were there for a wedding.   4 suit cases and clothes in a garment bag.   The room was so small we were tripping over each other.   There was a drawer under the bed to put suitcase and 3 wall hooks.   The bed was against the wall so my husband had to crawl over me to get out of bed.    Many of the other guests stayed nearby at the Grafton.   Our biggest regret.,2,2022,08,01
243,Complaint about Do Do,I stopped into the hotel on Monday morning after the football final and Do Do made a big deal about ordering me a taxi. He refused to order me a taxi saying that I need to have a room number or be a staff members. So Do showed no Irish hospitality but the rest of the staff could not have been nicer,4,2022,08,01
243,Terrible,"The hotel staff is very professional and nice, but the room is the worst I ever seen. 198x360cm are not a room but a grave. I can’t believe this hotel is 4 stars, no light to reed in bed, no wardrobe, no place to put the suitcase, to go to bathroom in the night I walked on my wife",1,2022,07,31
243,Modern hotel but fell a little short,"Hotel room was small for the cost paid, very modern, however no iron in room.
Had to go to iron room which was broken, iron sent to room instead !
Cannot charge items likes drinks to room which is frustrating with multiple receipts",3,2022,07,30
243,"Lovely rooms, but zero staff when you arrive",I was on a paid business trip and it was an absolute nightmare to try and sort my reservation as there were no front desk staff when I arrived at 5:30pm. Rooms and beds were lovely by my TV didn’t work and the bathroom lights stayed on automatically all night tried to contact reception about it and they said that’s just the way they work. ,3,2022,07,28
243,Tortured by maid service,We arrived at 6a and paid for a early check in to get a few hours sleep before enjoying the rest of the day. But the maid service would not stop coming to our door even though we had the 'do not disturb' sign on and after we told them numerous times to stop coming to the door. They even tried to come into the room a few times. It was absolute torture.,1,2022,07,27
243,Wouldn't recommend to a friend,"I stayed 2 nights here fri and Sat in July and it was not somewhere I would stay again. 
Pros- breakfast was lovely, food was good.
Had to ask twice for cappuccino but got one eventually. 
Bar was lovely, had a nice time here.
Location is ideal as it's right in the center of town. Although surrounded by Dublin flats so the views are underwhelming but no less easily accessible to the city streets.
Decor is lovely, modern and clean.

Cons.
You check yourself in, although I asked for help twice as my booking was under a company name for the first night (second night was an additional night my boyfriend and I stayed for a concert.) I left a key for him with reception when I got mine, as we arrived separately from work, he too had issues checking in.
Bed linen, I requested a change of sheets after the first night, as I spilled some bronzer on the bed, as well as fresh towels. This was refused, hotel policy was every 3 days....  all for sustainability but not dirty sheets for a second night.
The room size is tiny, more like a prefab. Think Amsterdam and then shrink it smaller! No wardrobes, no glass for your toothbrush, no face cloths, no extras by any means.
Taxi, I requested one for an event, 25 mins later, I rang my own they had no coverage.. 
We skipped breakfast on the first morning as we had lunch booked elsewhere.
For the second morning, breakfast was not included in our €400 a night room, so that was another €30euro.
The staff especially at reception were unhelpful and unfriendly. No one welcomes you and no one asks how your stay was. Upon departure I was given a subsidised car park card for 50EUR as was my boyfriend for 2 nights.
100Euro on parking alone.. 
They are obviously a self service hotel and a DIY approach at those prices don't work. 
For our future work events we will be going elsewhere as will my boyfriend and I.",2,2022,07,22
243,I would stay again,"Modern trendy hotel walking distance to St. Stephen’s Green, Grafton Street and  the pubs/restaurants on Williams St. Self check in and out was a little different but staff was there to help. Room was spacious, modern and the bed was very comfortable. ",5,2022,07,20
243,Tiniest Hotel Room I Have Ever Seen.,"The smallest hotel room we have ever been in, I feel cheated, the room was described as a “Cosy Room”  with a Kingsize bed and indeed it had, the bed stretched wall to wall and was pushed against the window, the only way onto the bed was at the side, as a 70+year old with arthritis I found it difficult though just about managed it, my wife has a Stoma so she is attached to a portable stand which sat on the floor beside the bed, so that was me trapped for the night, the room had a very small area to get dressed etc also had one chair so relaxing in the room was out of the question unless you sat or lay on the bed. On the plus side it was clean.",1,2022,07,16
243,Not worth the money.,"It’s a nice location but a small room, for the money (almost 200 euro a night) you don’t get a fridge or kettle. There was a washing machine or something going till after midnight on my last night that kept me awake. And I didn’t know the tipping culture in Ireland and didn’t tip for a meal and later ordered a beer from the bar and tipped the man a euro and he looked at it with disgust and walked away without saying a word. I felt so uncomfortable I never went back. Not a nice place to stay and I won’t go back again.",2,2022,07,16
243,Absolutely worth it,"Hotel exceeded our expectations, it's modern, clean, affordable, with friendly staff and great location. Bed are extremely comfortable and very large. I felt like I definitely got my moneys worth here. Next time we're in Dublin this is going to be place we're staying at, without a shadow of a doubt.
",5,2022,07,10
243,Dublin stay,Great location near many restaurants and pubs. A cute and modernized hotel. Everything was super clean and updated. Staff was very friendly. Parking was convenient as it was directly across the street and charged a discounted fee for staying at the hotel. ,5,2022,07,09
243,Small rooms but very comfortable,"You can see from the pictures that the rooms are pretty small, but all rooms in Europe are quite small, aren't they?  We also got a corner room that seemed like it was half the size (at least according to the layout on the fire escape map hah). 

The hotel is very clean and you get two bottles of water a day and can request clean up service whenever. 

The bed was very comfortable--got good rest.  And it's in a very quiet location (but walkable to everywhere in Dublin--we didn't spend any additional money on cabs), so no noise complaints.  Staff was friendly and helped us mail a few postcards internationally. 

A star comes off because it was quite expensive (+$300/night).  Would have definitely been correct value if it was only about 10% cheaper.",4,2022,07,08
243,Will stay here again,Great location vert near to Stephen's Green. The bed was comfortable and the room was very clean and modern. The lobby is beautiful and eclectic. The staff are friendly and welcoming. Would highly recommend.,5,2022,07,06
243,Liked it so much I stayed there twice,"My husband and I stayed in an executive king room for 3 nights and then I stayed alone later in our holiday in a cosy room for 1 night. The executive room was a good size for 2 of us for 3 nights with comfy bed, armchairs, good size bathroom and a nice outlook from the large window. The cosy room was perfect for 1 person but it might be a bit squishy for 2 people for more than a night. 

The hotel is in a perfect location for sightseeing and access to plenty of nearby restaurants and pubs. We ate breakfast at the hotel a few mornings and it was good. 

I’d happy stay at the Marlin again",5,2022,07,05
243,You can easily do better,"Place looked modern and newer. HOWEVER the rooms are small small small.
Our king bed was against the wall on 3 sides. did I mention small!! I saw people lined up every day trying to move to a better room or another hotel

my wife measured to make sure room was smaller than her walk in closet at home
1 drawer under the bed, no closet, and 3 hangers on the wall

Absolutely no services
No bellman or porter
no room service
housekeeping only every 3 days
Front desk was clueless as to local restaurants
No money exchange",1,2022,07,01
243,Eagles,"We went for concert and stayed in the Marlin Hotel,absolutely  perfect in every way.staff.ambience.cleanleness and location brilliant.Food top class,we walked everywhere from the Marlin,shops,concert and great pubs nearby ",5,2022,06,26
243,Overpriced,"Overpriced for what you get - tv didn’t work despite highlighting the issue after talking with an unfriendly customer team member 
Loud dance music from nearby premises until late in the night that we could have been made aware of
Positive’s were the bed and location - wouldn’t recommend ",1,2022,06,26
243,Expensive for what it is.,"The hotel is very modern and very central. Lacks the personal touch, you have to check yourself in whilst the staff are sat at a table with laptops, and when my partner asked to speak about the upgrade he had asked for he was answered abruptly with ‘we are full’
The rooms are tiny. No wardrobe or tea making facilities. A bed you have to climb over each other to get in and out of. Saying that it was the comfiest bed I have ever slept in.
Breakfast was ok, loads of choice, but no clean tables. Room not cleaned while we were there and no where to put wet towels. Cost around €640 for 2 nights.",3,2022,06,24
243,Awful rooms,Good bar and restaurant area but woeful rooms and no food or drink facilities after 10:30. Terrible to get a taxi from it. Little or no help from staff re local area. Rooms like a caravan ‘pod’. Reasonable location. Clean,1,2022,06,18
243,"Although expensive for the nights we stayed, the Marlin is a deserving four-star property.","We were very impressed with the Marlin Hotel Dublin. Just a 2 minute walk from Grafton Street the hotel is ideally situated. The large foyer is modern and allows plenty of space to check-in/out and sit around during your stay.

The room was very nice and met the standard you would expect from a four-star hotel. The room was equipped with a hairdryer, towels, water and a kettle with tea/coffee.
Although we were unable to access Netflix/YouTube on our television.
Also, the hotel only does housekeeping every 2/3 days, however, I would say if you needed new towels or bed sheets these would be supplied without hesitation.

The hotel is equipped with a vending machine, an ironing room, a gym, underground parking, a photo booth, a coffee dock and best of all the bar and restaurant.
We got a drink and ate at the bar on our second night and it fair exceeded our expectations. The staff were excellent and nice to chat to. The food was also of a very high standard, surpassing many popular named restaurants that we have visited around the city.

To conclude, I would highly recommend the Marlin for a stay in Dublin's city centre. The location and cleanliness combined with the facilities and service earn this hotel its four stars.",4,2022,06,17
243,By “cozy” they mean claustrophobic! Exorbitantly overpriced.,"The room is the width of a king mattress. No area to sit or deal with suitcases. I found it to be uncomfortably compact.  The check in experience was very flawed, we had already paid but were asked to pay again before a key could be made; finally got keys but then sent to dirty room. Limited services. Check in took an hour. On the positive side everything is new & clean. At $275/night incl parking I thought it was way overpriced.",2,2022,06,15
243,Location & room fantastic-. Sub Par staff.,"The location and room were great, not the largest bedroom but had everything we needed and a giant bed so that was nice.

The staff and complete lack of service really did let this place down. It has the potential to be great but the dismissive  (to the point of ignoring you) and lack of atmosphere from the staff really let it down. Considering it’s supposed to be a 4 star hotel we expected more.

Our room was also not cleaned, even though this was requested. Cleaning staff do work in the hotel as on our way out on our last day we heard them having a blazing row with either a guest or each other- classy.

Also email requests were ignored.

Location wise 10/10 and the bar staff were super friendly.

Expected more.",3,2022,06,12
243,Inn Hotel category ! For sure not a luxury one .,"Certainly the most expensive hotel for  basic Inn hotel . Euro 400 / night and a basic tiny room, you cannot even go around your bed ! Basic bathroom , noisy street side and a weak breakfast almost empty at around 0930 am.
And no cleaning , no change of the towels only after 3 days …. No coffee machine or fridge in the room , to erase from my memory quickly. Their philosophy that the main design hall will be used as a social meeting point , not sure what they mean when every body is hiding behind his mobile phone …. We have stayed 2 days . Almost euro 800 euro. I have the terrible feeling that I’ve been F…k",1,2022,06,12
243,Highly recommend,"We stayed for 3 nights and had a great time. The Cocktails we’re lovely, the bed was very comfortable, really modern rooms and the location was approx 10mins from most tourist spots. We would definitely recommend if visiting Dublin and we enjoyed the quirky touches like self check in and speakers in the bathroom. Thanks for a great stay!",5,2022,06,12
243,Windows don’t open,"Nice, clean hotel in a great location. But the windows in the rooms don’t open. This really lowered the experience of the stay as there was no fresh air in the room. Only air conditioning. 

The staff were really nice. I hated the self check in/out. It was so impersonal. It’s so much nicer to deal with a person and have the chat etc. Especially when the staff are so nice! 

No tea and coffee in the rooms either which was disappointing! 

Beds are huge and really comfortable.",3,2022,06,11
243,Wonderful Rest,"Despite what other reviews described, I found the check in kiosk to be easy to use and a hotel staff member ready to help.  They were able to store our luggage for us as well.  The cozy King room was small and a bit awkward but this became no problem at all due to the very comfortable bed.  It felt like sleeping in a large cloud...wonderful!  My only complaint would be the TV, which I seem to be too old to figure out.  Again, no worries, since the bed was so comfortable.  Another plus is the downstairs bar and cafe with its many nice areas to sit and relax.  We enjoyed this hotel very much but found it to be a bit expensive.",5,2022,06,09
243,"Good location, unhelpful staff","The hotel is beautiful. Room had everything I need, however, it does have a sign that says if you need anything else please ask. I had already asked the guy at check in for something which he said no to. Then later I requested a pair of scissors, and the staff member at the check-in counter said they don't have any, without looking. I thought that's quite useless for a 4 star hotel so I asked another staff member, a lovely friendly Italian guy, and he went to go get me one! So yeah. What other reviewers have said about the staff is true. Disappointing experience. Also, because check in is at a self service machine, you don't get any info about breakfast times or additional relevant info. Check in can be annoying but it would be nice if the screen at least told you what you need to know. Overall, could have been better.",3,2022,06,09
243,Excellent location and value for money,The hotel is in the heart of the city which makes it much more accessible. The bar is just wonderful and has anything and everything you may want. The staff are warm and welcoming and the checkin process through a kiosk was the first time I experienced it. I will definitely stay there again if I travel to Dublin ,5,2022,06,09
243,"Just awful, do nt stay here!!","Beyond useless. The staff are unfriendly, unhelpful and treat you like a complete inconvenience. They do not even answer when you ring reception. I would not recommend this hotel. The staff are awful and the rooms are overrated. The bar / restaurant area was filthy dirty. While staff stood around chatting and checking their reflection and not cleaning or taking your order. The only thing in the favour of this hotel is the location because you would not want to visit for the friendly welcoming experience. I visit Dublin regularly on business and pleasure and this is probably the worst hotel I have EVER stayed in. Just don't do it!!",1,2022,06,06
243,Rude staff let the hotel down,"Gorgeous hotel and amazing location. Room was lovely however the issue was at check in and check out. The staff were rude and dismissive to myself and my partner. The automated check in did not work so we were told to go to the reception desk. We were given our room key with no discussion on where the lifts were, what floor we were on, hotel facilities or even an ""enjoy your stay."" However the same staff were exceptionally helpful to everyone elsw. Perhaps because they were wearing suits? Similar experience on check out. Very disappointing. 

The service let down an otherwise great hotel.",3,2022,06,06
243,Not for a couple,"The hotel is clean and reasonably situated at the back of St Stephen’s Green. Well located for the RCSI. The hotel is modern and clean, breakfast is good but they are a bit short of tables at busy periods. Check in was by a machine - but someone stood by it and walked guests through the process. I’m sure it would have been quicker to check-in normally and it’s not as if they were saving on staff costs! The rooms are fairly small and have a bed at the end,  enclosed on 3 sides - so whomever is beneath the window has to climb over someone to get out. I think anyone over 6 foot would be in danger of feeling cramped. The air conditioning has a life of its own - there is so probably some method to setting it, but it wanted to simply reset itself ten minutes later. No wardrobe - just three coat hangers on wall hooks.

I would be happy to come here again if travelling as a single man living out of my suitcase on a short visit, but not with my wife.",3,2022,06,04
243,Amenities and customer service not what we expected,"From the website and location, the hotel seems to be very hip and trendy. Although the location is rather convenient and the lobby is flashy, the rest disappointed. The in-room bathrooms were poor structured. Considering the cold weather in Ireland, we were disappointed that for a very modern-looking hotel, we barely got any hot water in the shower. The bathrooms were huge but resembled a hospital, there were more emergency pulls and shower bars than actual bathroom fixtures. Very strange, never seen this before. You have to check-in on your own through a computer, which is fine, but considering the lack of customer service - this really takes away from the genuinely. Our phone was broken, so we went downstairs each time we needed something (inconvenient), and it was rarely done in a timely manner (more inconvenient). Even worse, they only stocked one small roll of toilet paper in the bathroom and never came buy to clean the room unless specifically told. My two star rating comes from the attentive and hospitable bartenders in the bar/restaurant, they helped more than anything whenever we needed something!",2,2022,06,03
243,Shame about the lighting issue,"I chose this over other hotels as good reviews. However, why design a bathroom with an automatic light that takes up to an hour to go off with a glass door opposite a mirror? Only if you want to keep guests awake all night! Why not respond to requests to turn it off until I asked 4 times, including moving to a room where it stayed on longer! 
Also not clear that only clean room after 3 days. No soap just shower gel. Safe too small for a laptop. 
Bed very comfortable and good towels but no towel rail.",2,2022,06,01
243,Just arrived and want to leave.,Most disappointing hotel ever stayed in. Food in restaurant when waiting to check in overpriced and very poor selection. No facility to pay by cash - must use automatic check in. Rooms are just ridiculous. Worst hotel ever stayed in - and only here one hour so far.,1,2022,05,30
243,Appalling customer service,"Self service check in desks that don’t work, being double charged for our stay, miserable, unhappy and unhelpful staff and senior management who are not visible when staff clearly cannot and will not offer proper and polite customer service. The hotel is in a wonderful location with trendy rooms and decor, this is totally ruined by staff who are rude, ignorant and incompetent, would not stay again or recommend.",1,2022,05,26
243,No value for money,"Breakfast way to expensive for what you get. Unfriendly lady at reception. Overall perception is way overpriced hotel for what you get. I do not want to be to pessimistic, but will never return to this hotel",2,2022,05,26
243,Not worth the money,"Paid >£300/night. Things not working properly but no effort from staff to resolve. Refridgerator broken, notified reception three times during stay, not fixed nor reason/apology given. Ice machines not working. Air conditioning unreliable leading to hot room. No housekeeping for 3/7 stay, have to wash up own cups/glasses but no equipment to do so. ",2,2022,05,23
243,Disappointing,"I always like to give as balanced and as fair a review as I possibly can.
-> Good things about the Marlin - brilliant location for The Gaiety, Stephen’s Green, Grafton Street and the surrounding areas. Very close to lots of great places to eat and drink, convenient shopping and parking just across the street. Lovely L’Occitane miniatures.
-> Average things about the hotel - tiny bathroom and odd rooms that feel more like upmarket student halls than a four star hotel. 
The furnishings just felt cheap in the rooms and also the foyer (plastic plant wall, student type plasticy sofas and odd furniture like benches which don’t scream 4 star).
-> Below average things about the hotel - the cleanliness - the bathroom was absolutely filthy (see photos).
There were hairs (not mine) everywhere, soap scum on the glass, mould all around the tray of the shower. The edge of the shower and the sink & shower outlets look like they have never been cleaned. I was terrified of my toothbrush falling into the sink. 
There were 2 bottles of water in my room (nice), and 2 glasses. One of the bottles of water had been opened and one of the glasses hadn’t been changed from previous occupants as I could see both lip marks on it and liquid in it (nasty). 
The bed was so hard and uncomfortable. 
I am glad I was staying on my own as you would have to climb over your partner to get out of the bed as it fills the room wall to wall.
Payment at the self-service consoles wasn’t working when I went to check in.
Verdict - It’s not the cheapest hotel around and I am glad it was work who paid for my stay. 
Would I spend my own money to stay here again? The answer would have to be no.",2,2022,05,21
243,Great location for City but an odd hotel,"Booked this hotel as it had access to a garage and good location for a dinner I was attending , but the staff did not know the hours of the disables bay opposite hotel , and the car park has very low ceilings and caught roof twice .
Beds are set so you have to climb across the bed and the room has no coffee or tea facility , room tiny and hooks for three items to hang no cupboard , very basic for 216 euro's",2,2022,05,21
243,Never again,"Self service check in didn't work so had to do it the traditional way but not enough staff to deal with this. No Tea/Coffee facilities in the room which for a hotel costing this much is totally unacceptable. No shower gel in the room, had to go to reception to get some. Numerous calls to reception and room service were never answered. Food average. Room service only comes round every 3 days so have to ask for shower gel and water each day, room not tidied etc.  Booked a taxi at reception, when I went down it hadn't been booked and I nearly missed an important appointment. Gave my email to have my receipt forwarded, still waiting for it, obviously I am going to have to contact them to have it sent.  The only positive was the bed was large and comfy and the breakfast was decent.

I will never book this hotel again.",1,2022,05,20
243,Revisit - worse,"After the last distinctly average visit I decided to try it again. Shocking.
1. Get a second coffee machine in the breakfast areas. People were queueing for 15 minutes. If it breaks you are stuffed. Its a good machine and as fairly tasty coffee but you are frustrating everyone.
2. You have spent a fortune on that self checkin machine in the middle, I watch it fail 100% of 8 people that came in the door. They approached the desk and were basically sent back to try again. Way to insult your customers and show PP service attitude.
3. I try and use the machine - it says it cannot find my booking. I approach the desk and am told to go back and try again and just say no. I show him the email with the booking number I used on my phone. He cannot find it either and claims I did not book. Again, customer service starts at not telling your customer he is the problem. Eventually (10 mins with people waiting) he allocates me the room and cannot work out if I have pre-paid or not. He asks me. I show him the booking which says clearly ""pay at location"" so not too hard to work out. I offer credit card and it is swiped and I enter the PIN. He takes it in GBP which means the hotels exchange rate has been applied to my card and cost me extra money. You are meant to offer the guest a choice of currency?
4 The first room I was show had been cleaned in the bed area but the bathroom floor had the previous occupants pubic hair all over it. COVID cleaning? I don't think so.
5. I try to call down to reception on the phone press 1. reception, no answer. 2. House Cleaning, no answer. 1 reception again twice, still no answer. So I go down and explain how dirty the room is. I get the expression that tells me he does not believe me so I show him the photos as I rather expected it given the check in process. I am asked if they are mine, seriously you have the nerve to ask a customer that within two minutes of them getting into the room and having seen the photos? I have light colour straight hair and these are jet black tight curled, don't enter any quiz shows Einstein. I ask why no one answered the phone and am told I should have phoned 0 to get him. 0 is not listed on the list on the room handset. Go figure why I did not dial the right number.
6. I am offered an alternative room, when i get moved after 20 minutes it stinks of damp. I go down and ask for another. I get the direct unchecked look of ""you are a PITA"". 
7. As mentioned elsewhere they do not clean the room each day, apparently COVID brings unforeseen benefits to save money. You get one small hairwash and conditioner and no other toiletries and they do not replace them unless asked. Same for toilet rolls so do pay attention!
8. There are insufficient seats in the breakfast area for the number of rooms. Combine this with the coffee machine and you can hear the grumbling.
9. It would appear that at night there is only one member of staff on duty in the hotel. Good luck if the alarm goes off.
10 When you shower there is no lip to stop the water cascading out onto the bathroom and then main room floor. Probably explains why 525 smelt of damp and probably annoys the hell out of the cleaners. Might even explain why they did not bother to do the bathroom in the first room they offered me?
11 You get two small bottles of water in your room when you arrive, not replenished. It okay as there are ice machines along the corridor. They are plugged in and running. But they don't dispense ice they just clunk-clunk-clunk when you hold the button.  4th and 5th floor the same. I could not be bothered to test the others. Either put a sign on them saying broken and unplug them or get them working? The air/con drys your throat so you need water.

I have spent many years in hotels and i will not be going back to this one. With the exception of the breakfast team who do seem to try and bring a level of service the front of house team appear to have been trained in Siberian gulag.

What can I say is good ?
The breakfast team and food are above average.
The bed is very comfy.
The location is pretty good.
Yup thats it.

To the owner Mr Corless, your staff are ruining your investment and your management are not sorting it out.",2,2022,05,20
243,"Minute bedrooms, short people only","The room was a shock. Never seen such a small hotel room! the bed is at the end of a small corridor, no good for people over six foot, your feet would be halfway up the wall. Inside person has to climb over outside person.
No wardrobe, just two hangers on the wall. No fridge, no tea making facilities, One draw under the bed for those who can bend so low. 
Breakfast was fine. Just book elsewhere, totally overpriced, only good thing is the location.",2,2022,05,20
243,Technology dispaces hospitality,"This hotel has been designed by a business-efficiency robot: so-called ""self serve"" check in, which did not work, a lack of shampoo and soap -- none in any room! -- which human managers could not provide, etc.",1,2022,05,18
243,"Complex, slow check in process",Card only payment not advertised prior to arrival.Self check in.. but no booking on system.. numerous others with same issue. Delay 1hr in foyer. no clear direction to room or information about facilities. Key for our room given to another party in our group when we were out!! Table’s not set up for breakfast.. food cold when eventually set up by ourselves.. Bed surrounded by 3 walls.. inside person had to climb over so not suited for elderly.. Personally I wouldn’t go back.. too many things wrong ,2,2022,05,17
243,Poor,Incredibly no soap in room. Claimed supply problems. No shampoo in room and towels when we arrived. TV did not work even after we complained. You need to check yourself in. Breakfast OK. Ground floor bathroom is a hassle to get to downstairs.,2,2022,05,17
243,Good with limitations,"Pros- excellent friendly staff, great breakfast, very clean.   Good location.    Huge bed.  Cons designed by someone who had never stayed in a hotel.    The room was small which I have no problem with but the room was designed around the bed which fitted lengthways wall to wall.   The only way to get in and out for the person nearest the window is to climb over the first person.   If you have a disability this is hard. If you have to get up in the night you are going to disturb your partner.    There is no bedside light, just a central fixture.   So as not to disturb my wife’s sleep I read by the light on my phone and, and this is the worst, no kettles.   To get a hot drink in the morning I had to dress , go downstairs to the bar and pay for two hot drinks.    For a relaxing weekend away this was a real pain.    I can’t fault the  staff but poorly designed.    This is a reasonably cheap hotel and it has some good features but other budget hotels provide drinks facilities in the room.   If your booking this make sure you get the larger rooms. I feel sorry for the staff who have to make the beds.   They must be very agile.",2,2022,05,16
243,Bad experience,"over rated and bad service overall
they put me in the wrong room i reserved and charged 528euro/night for the room which was small and non space to move about. Bathroom same.
Booked with the room for breakfast, that was also not added and had to pay next day morning in order to get in the restaurant for breakfast.
Poor assistance at reception as staff have non clue of what's going on and couldn't get me the right room i booked for and still ended up charging me the amount for the executive room booked for.
Many issues",1,2022,05,16
243,All modern amenities but no substance,"My husband and I stayed here this weekend as we were attending a play in The Gaiety, which the location for it and St Stephen’s Green is excellent. When we arrived we were early so they kept our bags while we went out and about the city. When we arrived back to check in we were told to do it at the machine while 3 members of staff sat around doing very little, this experience was not very personable. Once checked in a lady approached to inform us about breakfast and the residents bar and then to drop the bomb shell, “ no room cleaning or change of towels unless you are staying longer than 3 nights” I was blown away, what hotels in Dublin or anywhere has this policy… so we headed to the bedroom to find a very small room which was not cheap, and the bathroom wouldn’t have fitted the 2 of us at the same time. Very limited space for clothes storage, the wardrobe is the length of a blouse at best which didn’t suit very well as I had a dress for the show we were attending, 3 hangers total, 5 small drawers but 2 of them locked. I do have to say the bed was comfortable.So yes a very modern looking hotel, not 1 Irish member of staff, great location, but if looking the personable, typical Irish hospitality this is not the hotel for you",3,2022,05,15
243,"Avoid, avoid, avoid.","Chaotic check-in process and a very long wait for my room - during which time I got to observe many guests raising problems. Once I got to my room, it had a slither of a window and was almost in darkness. Getting my room changed was quite the ordeal. New room was brighter but small, very basic and overlooking a council housing block. A couple arrived into my room while I was unpacking, thinking it was their room too. The entire hotel is out of shower gel, as reported by one staff member who was trying her best to help. Staff look stressed and unhappy - they can only work with what they are given. While central, this is a very basic hotel experience - definitely not 4 star - and one not to be repeated in my case.",1,2022,05,15
243,Overpriced,"Rooms are modern but are pretty small.  The customer service is very poor and staff are not very helpful.  Our check in was delayed 3 hours due to the room not being ready at 3pm.  We were compensated for this with free breakfast which was actually quite good.  They also ran out of Guinness in the hotel for 2 days which is devastating being in Ireland!

It’s a nice place to be but it’s not the best value for money.",3,2022,05,14
243,Dublin stopover,"A short stopover in Dublin. I enjoyed the Marlin experiece. A great location, comfortable room and great customer service. Very convenient for Grafton St, Temple Bar and the city centre. Good choice for me",4,2022,05,13
243,Fine for the price,"Be sure to use card to pay for your stay, you'll be told they do not accept cash. Cosy king room comes with comfortable bed with little else. Bathroom is basic and a tight space. Shower spray causes floors to become wet and slippy. If wanting to use tv or other mod cons make sure to ask for a room in which they work. ",3,2022,05,13
243,Disappointing,"I stayed at the Marlin Hotel in 2019 and had been looking forward to my stay there this year as a result of that positive experience, and it’s in a great location. Unfortunately, the standards have slipped considerably since I last visited. I stayed at the hotel for a business trip for over a week. The room itself was perfectly comfortable but my main issues were with the breakfast service and housekeeping and general service. 

The breakfast service seemed very understaffed - every day I had breakfast there was some issue with items not being fully stocked. Eg, on one morning hot food had not been replenished (at 10am), another morning there was no yogurt, several times there were no cups for coffee, tables left dirty, orange juice had run out, and filter coffee was empty. This may be because they are understaffed but if you are staying more than 1 night, these things add up to a lot of annoyances. There is lots of selection breakfast wise but it was frustrating how every morning there was some issue. The blonde manager seemed annoyed a couple of times if I asked for a takeaway cup etc. All in all, would have expected a lot better for the price of the room. 

My second issue was around housekeeping. I was told in advance my room would be cleaners every 3 days. This was fine and it was cleaned on the third day. I then expected it to be cleaned 3 days after this and it wasn’t, even though I’d left the sign on the door. The following day, I asked a cleaning person if they could clean my room that day. When I returned in the evening, the room hadn’t been cleaned and I had to phone reception to ask for the room to be cleaned (which they did). This isn’t good enough for a hotel charging these prices. 

Finally, on the morning of my check out, there were lots of queues around the check out kiosks. I asked the man at reception if he could check me out. He directed me to the machines. I said I was in a rush and he said he would check me out, it literally took him a second. But he should have just offered to do it when I came up to him first. And in general, staff were not particularly friendly compared to my previous stay and asking for any assistance also felt like you were being a hassle (with the exception of a bearded man who seemed to be a new staff member at breakfast time and was very helpful and polite). It’s these basic elements of hotel service which make a lasting impression. 

The hotel is probably fine for one night but beyond that you will just end up getting irritated by an accumulation of issues. 

Unfortunately, due to this disappointing experience, I will not be staying at this hotel again.",2,2022,05,13
243,Nothing wrong here!,"Stayed one night on the 6th May after a recommendation from a friend. On the way down my wife started to show me the recent reviews of the hotel and I have to admit that I was slightly concerned.

All I have to say is that I am pleased to report that our stay was uneventful and not as dramatic as some previous reviews. In fact, our stay was almost the polar opposite.

Arrived at 15:15 and while the self check in was not working there were a number of well dressed, polite and friendly staff on hand to provide a manual, and immediate, check in service. A brief overview of breakfast options and we were guided to our nearest lift (elevator) within 4 minutes of walking in the door.

Rooms are exactly as described, pictured and was clean. Ample storage under the bed for our needs, and the bathroom facilities perfectly adequate and accessible. No dramatic near death experiences were encountered using the shower or bathroom facilities.

There was the presence of a cleaning trolley in the hall when we accessed the room, however this had disappeared by the time we quickly checked out the room and dropped our bags off. 

Check out via the self checkout facility was brief and simple. Hotel staff quickly and pleasantly facilitated the storage of our luggage after checkout. 

Numerous guests were observed enjoying the tranquil hotel lobby when I returned to collect the luggage. In fact, I wish I had stayed there to relax while my wife went about her business.

Overall great location, hotel and staff. Has a CitizenM vibe without as much quirky decoration and iPads in the room. As some suggested a little pricey, however this is to be expected at weekends in any major city that is popular with tourists. 

Would recommend and return myself again.",5,2022,05,09
243,"Excellent location, great bar & restaurant, very disappointing staff","The location is excellent, the hotel is new and functional and the rooms (though pokey) are generally clean, though the walls are paper-thin so you are at the mercy of your neighbours when it comes to noise. The restaurant & bar are efficiently run and have friendly staff. All of this would warrant a 4-star review, but the actual hotel service is disappointing. House keeping does not come even if you specifically request it at the reception (I tried this twice) and the receptionist tries to make you go away by explaining that housekeeping comes only every fourth day unless you request it. There is no checkin/checkout, everything is done through terminals in the lobby that do not actually provide you with an invoice, and you do not receive anything by email either, so good luck filing an expense claim after your trip. Often the reception is not even staffed even though several employees are standing around chatting. Overall I would not choose this hotel again.",3,2022,05,09
243,Good hotel in central location,"Hotel is perfect for a short weekend trip away. You check in on screens but it was easy to navigate and staff were on hand to help. They stored our bag for us when we arrived early and also again after we checked out on our departure day. It was the two of us in the room and there was plenty of room, small as expected in a city centre hotel but not the worst I've seen. 

Staff were friendly and helpful and the hotel was modern and clean. Bed was also huge and very comfortable. Shampoo, conditioner and body wash by L'occitane. Hair dryer in the room. No tea/coffee facilities but they have that downstairs. Good mirrors in the room and good lighting in the bathroom.

No view, but didn't need this for our short stay.

Really happy with the hotel and will stay again if we come to Dublin again.",5,2022,05,09
243,Not worth it,"At first glance the hotel appears very trendy, but it stops there unfortunately. There was no friendly welcome to the hotel on arrival; not the end of the world for me personally but does add an extra touch. Check in/out is done virtually but the computers didn’t appear to be working for anyone so this just caused delays. Main issue being the rooms were very small, no wardrobe space at all, just three hangers on the wall? No opening windows, floor was dirty throughout, especially in the bathroom which was also in need of some TLC. The rooms were not cleaned during our stay despite us leaving the appropriate sign on the door, the cleaners appeared more interested in standing around chatting! The bathroom lights are also on a rubbish sensor whereby even when in the shower etc, it doesn’t recognise your movements and so the lights turn off, which became infuriating! Only real positive is the location, but wouldn’t stay again, even if you’re like me and don’t spend much time in the hotel during a city break, you could still find much better for the price.",2,2022,05,07
243,Great 1 night stay for birthday celebration !,"Attended a gig in Dublin for my husbands birthday and wanted somewhere central to stay for just 1 night - this ticked all the boxes! Location is perfect. Didn’t eat in the hotel but the decor was very nice and modern. The hotel room was spotless, very small but perfect for what we wanted for just 1 night. The bed was one of the most comfortable hotel beds I have ever slept on- bliss! Little bit pricey considering no breakfast included but at the same time the price is on the same level as most other similar hotels in the city centre. Considering it was a special occasion it wasn’t a big issue. Would stay again!",4,2022,05,07
243,Amazing!,Had a great time at this hotel.  The restaurant was wonderful and the rooms were fabulous.  The bed was extremely comfortable. Plus the drawer under the bed was a great spot to store our bags. This hotel has a very cool vibe!!,5,2022,05,06
243,Trying to be chic but is actually just very very budget and poor,"This has been an extremely disappointing experience from the very beginning.  I emailed the hotel twice to find out about airport transfers and got absolutely no reply. 

Check in was 100% done on a computer screen, with the only interaction with a human being someone pointing us to a computer screen when we arrived with six bags. No one helped at all. Then we went to our room which is more like a cruise ship in that the bed is the width of the room. I have to climb over my wife to get out of bed!  Feels kind of ridiculous. 

Then the topper came tonight when we came back to the room and no one had been to clean at all. We would be better off in an Air B&B!",2,2022,05,06
243,There must be better value hotels,"Arrived at 18:00 and my room wasn't ready. Check-in was from 15:00. An hour later I was given access to the room. Very disappointed at the size. No wardrobes...just three hangers and under bed drawer. No tea/coffee making facility.

Housekeeping is every three days which seemed to include the corridors which remained dirty. Pictures taken.

Staff were a redeeming factor, but there must be better than this!",3,2022,05,06
243,No cleaning room service in four days,"We were 3 people in two rooms with 4 nights stay. The second day   I received a mail from the hotel saying they won't clean the room in three days. I checked  this in reception and they confirmed this lack of cleanness but they could provide clean towels. At the end of the stay we had a mount of towels in the room , we could hardly enter the bathroom.  An awful and shame experience !!!  By the way the room wasn't cleaned the 3rd day.",1,2022,05,05
243,"wonderful room, shame about the experience",".This hotel was beautiful inside and the rooms gorgeous. But on arrival at 6pm our room was not ready and when we asked after nearly half an hour of waiting (so by now nearly 6.30pm), we were told rather abruptly ""Well its done now!"". I then couldn't sleep due to an awful and uncomfortable repetitive bass noise from a neighbouring building, I have 3 young kids so im used to noise and disturbed sleep, and when I asked for ear plugs at reception, (I don't carry them as I've never needed them before) there were none available and no help offered. Safe to say I'd opt for another hotel next time if there were another available.",3,2022,05,04
243,Avoid this overpriced hotel!,Poorly managed hotel. Couldn’t get checked when we arrived after 5pm we had travelled for hours then told we could leave our bags. Staff were unapologetic and it seemed many of us staying at the hotel were suffering with the same issues. Dirty rooms that are tiny and overpriced. No atmosphere or somewhere you look forward to coming back to. They didn’t even have Guinness available. Couldn’t even get that right.  Awful just avoid it.  ,1,2022,05,04
243,Poor check in time,Check in time advertised as 3pm I arrived at 6pm was told room wasn't ready go to the bar and we will get you in 20mins. Group arrived into bar after me and reception came to them to say there room was ready. Very poor system in operation. By 630pm I had to go & demand my room. No Guinness or Smithwicks in the bar either. Staff were pleasant for the price it's not good enough & clearly issues that shouldn't be allowed to happen and dealt with better.,2,2022,05,01
243,Marlin Stay,"We were booked at Marlin for our last night in Ireland.  After having wonderful stays in Dublin, Killarney and Galway; our stay at Marlin was very disappointing.  The property has a cool “euro” vibe, which I like.  The bed was comfortable.  The rooms were small but clean.
We got to the hotel at 12:30 knowing we would have to leave our luggage and come back at 3 to check in.  When we came back at 3 to check into our 3 rooms, we were told they would be ready in 20-30 minutes because some cleaning staff did not come in.  I understand things are tough with staffing for everyone right now and I promise the 6 of us traveling our very empathetic.  We left to have a cocktail and came back about 4:30-5 to check in.  They were scrambling.  We had 1 room ready within about 10 min and one around 5:30.  I waited for my room until almost 6 when my sister in law finally went and asked for “any” room because we had dinner reservations.
It’s not the availability of the room that was the problem.  It was how staff handled the situation.  They were not communicative, did not make eye contact, didn’t seem motivated to help us and were quite cold and unsympathetic.  A smile or the offer of a cocktail while we waited would have gone a long way.
It was our last night in Dublin and instead of seeing more of the city, we spent far too much time waiting in a lobby being ignored.",1,2022,05,01
243,Great city centre hotel,"Perfect hotel for what we required - one night stay on a bank holiday Saturday in Dublin. Yes it’s expensive but still one of the most reasonable in Dublin! 
Check-in was simple. We did it online and on arrival just had to type our surname into the machine. Plenty of staff around to help and all lovely.
Rooms are pod style so not huge but enough space for a couple for one night. A bit like Citizen M hotels. Big comfy bed. Good wifi. Bottled water. No kettle which would have been good. L’occitane products in bathroom, which is also small but perfectly serviceable. Under sink lights were a bit strange and took a few minutes to go off themselves after turning main light off. 
Q park right opposite hotel which you get a discount for.
Great location, just a couple of minutes walk to Grafton Street.",4,2022,05,01
243,Dreadful - You couldn’t pay me to stay here again.,"For an upmarket hotel the entire process and services offered are borderline zero.

Self checkin, which is awkward and clunky - no warm welcome. 

Rooms - comparable to a cabin on a Ferry. Very small, no room to comfortably unpack. No wardrobe, no iron. The room width is approx 7ft, you’re boxed in on 3 sides. 

En-Suite - actually dangerous. There’s a PIR sensor that switches the lights off every 15-20s. The lights went off whilst showering, so I had to move out of the shower to re-engage the light (it was pitch black). Due to this, I slipped on the shower drain covering, landing awkwardly and hitting my head on the back of the shower. This was reported (twice) to the staff, however, the PIR timer was not extended. - why the hell you need a sensor is beyond me! 

The ironing room - AKA: the electrical & comms cupboard  at the back of the floor level, looks like an HSE dream! Approximately 3mx1.5m this room is intended for every guests ironing needs. This is the sort of room that you would normally need a permit to work in order to enter!

Breakfast - average.

Carpark - multi story across the road.

Housekeeping - could be heard banging doors (PLEASE provide your staff with doorstops!) and vacuuming at 22:00! Rooms cleaned once every 3 days (not even towels or soaps provided daily)

This hotel is very understaffed. 

I have blacklisted this hotel for our company. If this was the only hotel available in Dublin then I would cancel the business trip.",1,2022,04,29
243,Disappointing,"Ok so it starts with the check-in - what's wrong with a good old fashioned check-in?  Instead this hotel has PC's which don't work very well and staff just milling about that basically end up doing it all for you. The whole process simply takes up minutes of your life you sadly won't get back. 

The room, don't bring a cat as you won't be able to swing it - small is an understatement. 

The bathroom is painfully small - I really don't like trying to dry myself after a shower and having the towel licking the bowl of the toliet! Also showering lends itself into a small flood in the room which resulted in my slipping. 

There also seems to be a serious problem with staff as room cleaning seems to go on past my bedtime which makes it really noisey - my room was cleaned once in the week so resorted in getting clean towel from gym and supplies from the tolleys which are always in the corridors.

Didnt experience the bar but looked nice, breakfast was fine too. 

Seriously go elsewhere",1,2022,04,29
243,Appalling hotel,"Overpriced hotel which is no more than a glorified hostel in terms of its rooms which are very small. The bed was akin to that of a caravan where you couldn’t get around it and was only accessible on one side. At €300 per night, I couldn’t even walk around my own bed. The rate charged for the room we got was dreadful and I wouldn’t recommend this hotel to anyone. ",1,2022,04,29
243,Great location and good staff but over priced,"Great location, nice staff, very clean, good food and bar but understaffed, poor tech that wasn’t working in the room large flatscreen tv that wasn’t working,bad value for money as parking and breakfast are extra. If you are claustrophobic the bed May freak you out ",2,2022,04,28
243,Tiny room at a crazy price,Room is the smallest I’ve ever stayed in and is complete robbery for €300 for one night stay. Sensor controlled lights in the toilet so they keep going off while your using the toilet or in the shower.,1,2022,04,25
243,Lovely stay,"Gem of a hotel off Stephen's green. Near the hussle and bussle but quiet and calm. Modern and clean. Bedroom was small but cosy and quiet. Not cheap but the location fantastic. Lovely to have a quiet, calm, clean place to return to after a day's shopping and after a brilliant concert in Croke Park! Thanks to all the friendly staff",5,2022,04,25
243,Fantastic night away in Dublin!!!,"From start to finish our stay was just fantastic. The staff were lovely, check in/check out was so quick (you do it yourself on a touch screen in the lobby), the bar & food was great, the room was spotless, bed was so comfy, shower was lovely. The location is perfect just a couple of minutes in a taxi from Heuston Train Station, once you get to the hotel everything is walking distance. We will definitly be back it was such a great friends night away in Dublin. Big shout out to all the lovely staff for making our stay so good. They make fab Mojitos too! ",5,2022,04,21
243,Not worth the money,"We stayed here for 2 nights over the Easter weekend, which means the price was ++ expensive. We expected much more for paying quite a bit of money, and for the hotel being rated at 4 stars. 

The bed was comfy but the room overall was very small - we were fine for 2 days but if we were there for a week like we often are when we travel, it would have been very claustrophobic.

The room did not have any toiletries, nor face towels.  The hotel also doesn't inform you that they do not freshen the rooms daily, so over our 2 night stay we didn't get fresh towels nor the garbage emptied once. There wasn't actually a rack for towels either, so over the course of the 2 days, we had no where to dry out our towels we had been using, and they had to be placed just on the vanity counter. Not a huge deal - but for a 4 star, expensive hotel, I'd expect a hand towel rack at least.   Another detail that would be nice for staff to mention is that there is a speaker connected to the TV in the bathroom, as well as through the TV, but they are controlled separately - This took us a bit to figure out as the knob was next to the toilet and tiny, and at a level quite loud.  The TV also was quite wonky - it kept randomly turning off and this issue we could never solve. 

The food in the breakfast was alright, not a lot of options if you have dietary restrictions (ie, gluten free, vegan).  

The staff at the front desk/self check in station (which was cumbersome and just unnecessary to have in my opinion) were fine, but that was it, not really exceptional. 

Overall I would probably stay elsewhere and not return unless the pricey rates went down significantly! just missing a lot of the details that bring things from a very Meh experience, to a great one.",3,2022,04,20
243,Disappointing!,"Disappointing. Room was not ready to check into until 1 hour after check in time. Multiple other users experiencing the same issues. Although staff were polite, the service is primarily automated and impersonal and in this case ineffective as rooms were not ready. The room itself would have been fine if not for clogged sink which was dirty and smelled, glass shower curtain / guard is not effective and a puddle formed on the floor of bathroom and room, bathroom lights are motion activated but not very sensitive and also go out after approx. 30 seconds each time which made for a dark shower. There was a bulb gone in the bathroom also. Oh and the hair dryer stopped working. Location is good but in overall terms not value for money based on this experience. Poorly run based on this stay!
",2,2022,04,18
243,Lovely hotel,"Stayed in this hotel for a couple of days last week. Hotel was great, loads of character and quirky bits downstairs. The bed was the comfiest we had in Ireland and the room was good - massive floor to ceiling windows giving a view of Dublin. Location was very central, lots of bars and restaurants literally a minute or two away. Would happily come back here and recommend it.",5,2022,04,18
243,Very modern. Unbeatable location,"You can't beat this place for the location, it couldn't be more central. Very very modern and clean. Rooms are a bit pokey but the space is used very well with some clever storage. Would absolutely stay here again",5,2022,04,18
243,"Great modern hotel , rude staff","Me and my partner stayed here for one night. On check in we had to use a computer to check in which was slow. The were was an Eastern European women watching us do this, she appeared to be in charge of reception. She was very rude in her responses when we asked for help. 
On checkout the same woman was at reception. We tried to check out but the computer ‘could not find our reservation’ so we went over to the same lady at the desk to tell her and she was extremely rude. We said can we check out here it’s not working and she told us to try again. Her general tone and attitude was very unwelcoming. However I will say this was the only downfall in an otherwise perfect hotel.",3,2022,04,17
243,Disappointed,"The room was spacious and the bed comfortable. But housekeeping lacking... had to request fresh towels as the bathroom had poor ventilation and our towels remained damp. Toiletries, extra pillows lacking ... the same coffee cups for 3 days, not good, this is not a cheap hotel. The bathroom lights are on a timer and the TV both turned off after random amounts of time. I asked the concierge if they were suffering staff shortages due to Covid. No he replied, he was quite rude. The Hotel looks so great, arty and interesting, but service and hospitality are of far greater importance. We would not return.",1,2022,04,16
243,Service not worth the price,"This has the potential to be a good hotel, but it is poorly run. The service is not commensurate with the cost. My issues on my first night, in chron order:
(1) Check in is automated with little help from staff, which just sort of mull about. Not exactly “4-star” hotel service.
(2) My room did not have hand soap, face/wash towels (which are necessary for the small body wash amount they give you), facial tissues, or a do not disturb marker. I noticed the hand soap and facial tissues when I first arrived, so I called for them. Three hours later, I had to call the concierge again. The concierge delivered hand soap and two extra rolls of toilet paper. When I asked for facial tissues (thinking there had been confusion), I was told that she was not housekeeping, could not access facial tissues, and that maybe they would be available the next day.
(3) After midnight, I try to go to sleep to find that there is no way to turn off the lights under the bathroom sink. I call the concierge, and I am told to wait 20 minutes after shutting off the main bathroom light but to call back if they don’t go off. If they don’t go off, they will need to come up and shut them off manually. I wait. Come 1 am, the lights are not off. The bathroom door is translucent, so the lights shine into the room. Still wanting to go to sleep, I call. The concierge tells me the manager is the only one that can turn them off and that he is away, and to wait 20 minutes. As I start to say “that’s ridiculous,” the manager snatches the phone and says he’ll need to come up. I tell him that so far my visit has not been great. He asks if I need anything else: I list facial tissues, face cloths, and a do not disturb sign.  He comes up with large body towels, even more toilet paper, and seems genuinely confused as to what I asked for.

He fixes the bathroom light with a screwdriver in the ceiling. Unlike what he has suggested to me earlier, the light is not actually timed; it’s tied to the opening and closing of the door. So, I waited for the light to go off, when someone should have come up immediately to fix they fixture instead of making me wait to go to bed.

 I then wait another 20 minutes because the manager ran off to retrieve face cloths and facial tissues. He comes back with neither. Instead of face cloths, I receive two more medium-sized handtowels, and I am told that this hotel does not provide face/wash cloths. (Apparently, they would like me to use the whole tiny bottle of body wash for one shower.)

There are a lot of other hotels with good Dublin locations that cost as much as this one. Go to one of those.",2,2022,04,15
243,Nice stay,"After reading bad experiense from people I was worrined. Bug clearly the hotel have worked on to be better. I enjoy my stayes. Good breakfast-helpful staff-
Chech in and out rhe staff was helpful-order a taxi-   Anll was great exeprept one thing. 
-in the hotel.com it says  daily houskeeping-but this is not true- there are no houskeepinf for 3 days. No new towel-no coffee or milk for coffeemachine -no water ( only forst day)   It is  better to say it is better to know this things- it eas not botering me. But better to know-  we got a
Milk and coffe from person how was cleaning empty room. 
The shower is not hot end only few drops 
The cleaning er only ok
Bit overall i would stay there again. Because i saw that the hotel staff is trying ro be very nice
Hotelstaff Was all very Nice with us  amd helpful",4,2022,04,15
243,Was able to check us in early,We arrived at the hotel a few hours early and George was able to check us in and put us in a room pretty much as soon as we arrived it made the weekend break get off to a fantastic start great service and a wonderful hotel,5,2022,04,15
243,Disappointing,"Stayed at the Marlin last night for 1 night. Last minute booking whilst on business in Dublin and I was looking for a city centre location.  Location couldn’t be faulted. 2 mins to Grafton St and close to bars/restaurants, but otherwise the hotel experience was disappointing.

Hotel is super modern as others have said and first impressions were good, but quickly went down hill. The self check-in kiosk informed me that there were no rooms available, despite my confirmed booking. This was reasonably quickly corrected by one of the reception staff, but once I had my room key I was left wandering around looking for the lift until another guest pointed me in the direction of the elevators.

The lobby area is also dark and lacked any real atmosphere. As a female travelling on my own, it definitely wasn’t a space that I would have felt comfortable coming down to sit in. 

My “cosy” room was certainly cosy and whilst fine for one person for one night, I was relieved that it was only a short stay. For me personally it wouldn’t have found it comfortable for a couple or for a longer stay. 
The bathroom was modern and clean, but felt a bit like an aeroplane toilet. Functional but not luxurious in any way. 

The bar menu was limited, so I decided to eat outside and there were plenty of options close to the hotel. 

On going to bed I turned over one of the pillows only to immediately spot marks on the pillowcase and also a couple of very short dark hairs… which obviously weren’t mine! I quickly checked the rest of the bedding which seemed fresh and clean - but I was left feeling less than comfortable and with the sense that housekeeping hadn’t properly cleaned the room. 

Check out this next morning was unclear and the male staff member manning reception was rather abrupt and off hand when I had to ask for help. 

Definitely a modern hotel and as mentioned already, its in a great location, but it lacks the warmth and character I had expected for a 4 star hotel. Overall a disappointing stay.",3,2022,04,14
243,"Probably 1 star, if that is worthy of it.","Arrived early for check in, so they put our luggage away .But they lost our bag and then found it in a meeting room ??? That's the good bit.  Came back to check in on their auto terminals, no staff to check you in but 4 people standing behind a desk to the right. 
Auto terminal refused to accept my Visa debit card twice (despite the account having enough money on it.)
Asked for assistance and was told to use a different card.  I did, I used my visa credit card and got receipt and room keys.
Room was a prison cell and for €279 (including dinner in bar and breakfast).
Came to check out and we were asked for another €92 for bar food which was already in the deal. So the guy says ""I'll scrap that""
And now a week later they have charged me twice for the room, once on debit card that didn't work and once on Visa card.
Have spent all day trying to get refunded, but hey, they don't care.
I had to send my bank and credit card statements to them, because apparently they cant see the payments on their system.

This place is a joke. And I will get my money back.

Stay away at all costs.",1,2022,04,14
243,Items stolen from my room   |   Firealarm went off early morning   |   10 min for a take away coffee,"The hotel looks great but I was disappointed and will not be staying here again
- within 30 min of checking out I realized I had forgotten something of value in the room, I emailed the hotel asking them to send me the items (on my expense of course). The hotel acknowledged my email right away. Long story short: The items never turned up and the GM got involved and informed me that I can't be compensated for my loss and that I should reach out to the Garda, the Irish police, which I did. The garda kindly passed by the hotel and saw cctv footage which shows that between me leaving- and housekeeping cleaning the room nobody entered the room. I'm disappointed how senior management at the hotel has handled my case and that there wasn't further cooperation to be compensated for my loss. Their reasoning: I can't prove that I did really leave these items in the room, which to me doesn't make sense. When someone has their wallet stolen in the street, how can they prove they had their wallet on them in the first place?
- A parfum disappeared from my colleagues' room during her stay in the same time. She mentioned this to reception but didn't take the case any further. This tells me the hotel has a more deeply rooted issue with things going missing
- The fire alarm rang before 7am during my stay (weekday)
- 10 min wait for a take away coffee as the breakfast team was clearly understaffed",1,2022,04,13
243,Two night delight,"Booked a Sweet Suite here for a 2 night stay with bed and breakfast. The hotel is modern and stylish, very cool and relaxed atmosphere throughout.

We enjoyed our spacious room and felt it well worth the extra cost. 

Hotel location was excellent for us on our visit allowing us easy access to shopping, bars and restaurants.

Breakfast was great! Hot buffet didnt disappoint and the quality of the produce was noticeable particularly the black pudding! 

Great stay, pleasant staff, I will definitely check in again for any future trips.
",4,2022,04,12
243,Great location but a lot to work on,"Reception only accepts card as payment- this is not made clear before arrival. Tried paying cash and it was exhaustive. Took the whole stay to get my change back. Which was a little ridiculous. Hotel decor is beautiful. A lovely space where everyone can find a space they enjoy. Great location. Right in the centre of the city. 
Room facilities aren’t great- no tea/coffee facilities in the room. Technology in the room (tv/Bluetooth) didn’t work well. 
You can only access the bed from one side so would be hard for someone with mobility issues to access…. Again this isn’t notified before staying. Room and bathroom were spotless
Mixed reviews about whether I’d return",3,2022,04,11
243,Very disappointing stay,"We were extremely dosappointed following our recent stay in this property. We have stayed before in summer last year and absolutely loved the hotel, staff and experience and have been recommending it to people ever since. This weekend was the complete opposite. 

We were told check in time would be 3pm and we were left waiting until 4:30 with no room. When we were eventually able to check in not one staff member assisted us informing us of the floor we would be on, the check out/breakfast times, nothing. 
Upon arriving to the room we entered the bathroom we noticed the floor was dirty and disgusting with filth and pubic hair all over the floor. 
After asking to be moved room because of this the manager at reception went and checked a room for us before bringing us the keys. 
It clearly hadn’t been checked very well and this room was also dirty! The coffee table had spills all over it, coffee spills on the carpet and crumbs on the floor. And last but not least there was someone else’s socks still on the floor!!

All of the problems we had this weekend seemed to stem from very bad house keeping!! The rooms had not been cleaned or inspected properly and were also not ready at the correct check in time meaning we had to rush out to our evening reservations. 

We were extremely disappointed and will not be coming back. Such a shame as we had highly recommended this hotel to family and friends. We have done the opposite now and warned them to stay away.",1,2022,04,11
243,Wow What a fab hotel,From the minute we walked in the door the hotel and staff were excellent .Check in was self service but there was a girl to help if it was needed and she also showed us to the lifts and was so efficient .  The bedrooms omg are so clean and so modern . Bedding so fresh and clean . Electric curtains so no dust anywhere . Shower excellent and plenty of towels and products to use . Not a sound all night the quietest room we have ever stayed in . Staff in bar excellent . Highly recommended and will be back . Location unreal . Well done marlin hotel and ur excellent staff.,5,2022,04,10
243,Review,"This is my first ever time writing a review I dont want to but I feel I need to

Good:

Location

Comfy pillows

Very cool lobby

Bad:

Staff not welcoming. 

We were not warned that we could not pay with cash and we had to run around stressed out to get money onto a card in the late evening. The woman did not seem to care or want to help us. This could have ended really bad. We travelled to get to this hotel, what if we didn't carry a bank card? 

no fresh towels

My boyfriend organised with them for them to print a picture and leave it on the bed for when we arrived. They left a plate saying happy birthday (its not my birthday) and stale treats. They did print the picture tho(of my cat lol). 

Could not open windows to get fresh air. I woke up with a sore throat and nose

Tiny room and bed took up half of it 

Chunks of someone elses hair stuck to shower wall

There was no hair dryer or any sort of essentials(we asked the kind blonde lady at the coffee truck inside helped us with that and got a hairdryer sent to our room) 

We payed an extra €30 to have a later check out on our last day but it was another waste of money as there was constant door slamming, banging and cleaners pwalked in 3 times during our lie in waking us(we had a do not disturb sign on door) When i complained about this when we were on our way out the lady did not seem to care and was not helpful.

For the price I really was expecting a really nice hotel experience where i could relax, take a bath(there wasnt one but there was a shower with half a door). We have payed alot of money and I left very let down. I didnt feel accommodated and it has turned me off staying in hotels in the future. Very let down. 
 
Will not be returning!",2,2022,04,09
243,Don’t stay,"Staff not at all welcoming. They do not greet you when arriving/leaving each day.
Not even acknowledged when leaving ! 
Breakfast is rubbish 
Had to ask both days for towels and room not cleaned once with the excuse we clean every 3 days! We’d at least expect clean towels everyday! We won’t be back !",1,2022,04,09
243,Fair,"Some of the downsides to the room we stayed in was not being able to open a window to allow fresh air in and no hair dryer or body wash. I liked that we coukd cast whatever onto the TV be it music or shows however with covid still being a thing not being able to open a window to let in fresh air was not great. The bed was comfortable and the TV was nice. We however in the bathroom had one bar of soap and one bottle of shampoo and towels, there wasn't any other body wash or hair dryer, luckily we had been shopping so had some body wash to use. We stayed in the room pictured where the bed is under the window and tv at foot of bed. I did like the buttons for the 2 sets of blinds. The location is great for shopping but not a hotel I'd recommend if you're looking to spend a lot of time in the hotel room as it was smaller than others. ",3,2022,04,07
243,Birthday not made special ," Good
- The location was fantastic
- The hotel reception and breakfast areas were decorated very trendy
- The bed was extremely comfortable
- Breakfast was very good

Bad 
- Check in was absolute chaos, we were given 3 dirty rooms before finally getting a room. I had to get ready in friends room while waiting
- I had been advised I would have a happy birthday dessert plate for my husband, never happened
- Bathroom light was on a sensor / timer and went out every 10 seconds. Incredibly frustrating
- Food service in the bar not great. Our party of 4 ordered and only 2 meals arrived, had to reorder and wait for the other 2

For all the above inconveniences, we were refunded 25% of the room bill",3,2022,04,07
243,Very Dis-appointing,"Very disappointing. Staff never entered our over 3 nights. Room was the size of the interior cabins on a cruise ship. Bed was comfortable for person on the outside. The bar and working areas are good. Totally over priced, for what you get. The location is good.",2,2022,04,05
243,Great business stay in Dublin,"Top beds in nice sound proof confortable modern rooms (expect minimal design but maximum sleeping time). Great for working - good wifi, confortable work stations in a large co-working space lobby. Great for relaxing too, with a good bar, a hotel restaurant (standard fare though) and a terrace.",5,2022,04,04
243,Very poor service,"Hotel is clean, very ""hip"" but thats where the positives end. The service from check in to check out was appalling. The automated checking system simply does not work, no management of queues etc, so randomly choosing which customers to check in in the good old traditional method and leaving others without any service.  When we finally got checked in, I asked for a bucket of ice and some glasses for the room and was told ""we dont do room service""  a ""4 star"" hotel, that wont bring ice to your room!!  I persisted, and a friendly barman very reluctantly brought them to our room!
Breakfast the next morning is entirely self service, queues for coffee, tea etc, nothing too bad, just irritating.  The hot food was cold but overall the selection of foods was good.
Check out was the final straw.  Large numbers were checking out at the 11am check-out time, none of the automated checking kiosks were working and the queue ran from the front desk right out the front door.  Only one member of staff who was dealing with a (nother) exacerbated customer, but who seemed utterly oblivious to the chaos around him! I spotted another member of staff and asked if he could help us check out, validate our parking etc and he said he didnt know if he could help, he had to check with his manager!! Awful, awful unprofessional service.  I heard lots of guests panicking as they had flights to catch, so at least we were not in that position,  When we finally got to the manager to check out I advised of our frustrations and he just said ""Sunday morning is always busy"".  What an utter disappointment.  To pay those extortionate rates to stay in Dublin these days and to be met with abysmal service - Just not good enough. We will NOT be returning.",1,2022,04,03
243,Cool hip hotel,"Great staff, clean hotel. Absolutely great food and drinks in the bar. loved the late residents bar best weekend in a long time! Brilliant staff in the residents bar on Friday night. Just wanna say the girl cleaner with the pink in her suit was so friendly and accommodating to us",5,2022,03,28
243,Very poor service,Came back after a long day out to fund room unmade and without a changes off towels. This despite leaving the sign on the door for the rooms to be made. Only to receive some excuse that they only turn rooms every third day. Terrible service for the price.,1,2022,03,26
243,Double Charged..poor service,"Location is excellent, however when checking in using the automated system, initially it did not work and so checked in and ended up paying at reception. I discovered the following week, my card had been charged twice. After complaining i was refunded, but was extremely dissappointed by the service and the staff member's insistence on the customer has to take all the risk, when their systems are faulty. Check in left a bad experience due to the extended discussion, subsequent double charging. The hotel offered a future visit at a reduced rate, which however, was cheaper to use online booking. Overall, while location is excellent, i would suggest an alternative hotel.",2,2022,03,25
243,Great location and super helpful staff,"Really impressed with every aspect of the hotel. The location is absolutely perfect, it is so central and really great if you plan to do a lot of walking. 
The check in was done by machine which I was a little confused with how to operate but a member of staff could see I was struggling and was over straight away to help. I didn’t get his name but he was really great! 
I loved the rooms in this hotel, small but have everything you need including smart tv and electric black out curtains was really cool. Sort of futuristic kind of hotel I would 100% return.",5,2022,03,23
243,Paddy’s Day,"Great staff, lovely decor in hotel lobby / bar etc… check the room size before booking.  “Cozy king” is not fit for two people that like comfort.  I thought it was too small for me as a solo traveler.  Room was the width of the bed.  300 euro (inflated by Paddys day) is nowhere near good value for that.",3,2022,03,23
243,Quiet Hotel in a Great Location,"Stayed here with my wife in early March as part of a Honeymoon trip. The Marlin is located in a great location, and in easy walking distance to most of what Dublin has to offer. The hotel is newer, and therefore very clean and modern. We stayed during the middle of the week, and honestly felt like we were the only one's there. We had booked a Superior Room, which unfortunately was very basic. The amenities provided were standard, and we had one small window above the TV with a view of the rooftop. Overall, the service was great but please confirm the details of your room before check-in.",4,2022,03,22
243,Ideal city centre location,"Brillant hotel, fab, parking right across the road and shopping around the corner,thumbs up from me.So clean very modern will definitely stay here again if looking for an ideal centre location. All boxes where ticked for me on this stay  plus the beds are soooooo comfortable ",5,2022,03,18
243,Great hotel,"This hotel is perfect for a night in Dublin. Fantastic location, funky interior and modern and spotless. We ate dinner in the restaurant (Canteen). The food was amazing. Definitely recommend the hotel. ",5,2022,03,11
243,Modern and cosy,An absolute gem! The bed was huge and like a dream to sleep in! The hotel was like new and very modern which we loved! 2 bottles of water were left in the room which was great after coming back from shopping! Can’t wait to stay again! ,5,2022,03,09
243,Easy and convenient,"Would recommend. Clean, convenient, great location.
Great bar service although menu could have had a healthy option on there. 

Blackout blinds in the room and nice l’occitane products. Was missing a body lotion. Super comfy bed and quiet room",5,2022,03,08
243,Comfortable and convenient ,"The room was small but very comfortable with a huge king bed.  The bathroom also small but well laid out.  All clean and modern.  A coffee machine would be a big plus.

Avoid the bar and grill.  The menu was limited, the food quality extremely poor and the staff lacked communication skills.  I'll return to stay at the hotel but will eat elsewhere.",4,2022,03,05
243,Excellent,"Location, cleanliness, price, sleep, technology all outstanding. Didn’t have much interaction with staff apart from check in but he was really friendly and informative. Stay in Dublin a lot and we will definitely be back and have already recommended it.  ",5,2022,03,04
243,"Trendy hotel, amazing value in central location","Stayed with my Mum here for a night and check in was so efficient, the hotel is immaculate and new. Used the gym really clean and towels available, breakfast was delicious with lots of choice. Well worth a visit ",5,2022,03,02
243,Great location but that is about it,"A modern clean hotel ideally situated for a Dublin tourist.
Sadly the management appears to be carried out by a money-saving algorithm.  Untrained, cold reception staff could take a leaf out of most Dublin pubs and restaurants as to what an Irish welcome should feel like.  I don’t blame them - it comes down to poor management.  Likewise a simple request or problem (an extra pillow - a bathroom light not working properly) prove too much for the algorithm.

When will they learn that staff and training matter?",2,2022,02,21
243,"Good overall, just needs some tweaks","Good side.
Modern, Fresh, CitizenM clone
Breakfast was good self service with good tea and coffee, hot irish etc and fruit and pastry's.
Parking under the building.
Standard rooms are compact but comfortable. Individual air conditioning.
Bed is clean and comfy.
TV has a good range of channels
Very good location with loads of shops and places to eat nearby.
Not a noisy distract and very quiet in the rooms.

Not so good.
No tea or coffee facilities in the room
Bathroom floor needed a serious clean not just a wipe with a cloth, grained in dirt in the tiles is not nice. The shower is clean but a little weak on pressure.

I had a booking for a standard room and when looking at the site the upgraded room is only £10 more. I emailed in advance about an upgrade, nothing. I called and was basically flipped off and told to arrive and ask. So on arrival I ask and have an expectation of 3 nights at about £10 a night. The receptionist asks for an upgrade of £500 additional. I ask to clarify and am told that that is the upgrade cost. The room alone for three nights comes to less on the web site. Great service, no additional payment here then.

I would stay there again but it did leave a bad taste.",4,2022,02,19
243,Modern hotel in a great location.,"Really enjoyed our stay at the Marlin.  A well designed, contemporary hotel in a handy location. So vibrant and colourful with lovely vintage touches throughout. Pleasant and professional staff. Good use of technology throughout hotel.",5,2022,02,19
243,Won't Be Back,"For a start I did the online check-in but was told I still had to check in when I got there. Then was informed I couldn't pay in cash though no plausible reason was given...just some vague mumbling that utilised the 'covid' word, though we all know that it's not the reason at all.
The room was fine if you wanted to relive your student accommodation days, ie, a bed wedged into an alcove. We found this added to the general feeling of claustrophobia in the very small room.
Three coat hangers on the wall passed for a 'wardrobe'. They're obviously not encouraging guests to stay for more than one night but worse of all, no kettle etc in the room! Only the second time in my life that I've stayed somewhere where you can't make your own tea. However, the worse thing of all was that, after going to the trouble of installing an excellent blackout blind, they had, in the bathroom, installed undershelf striplights that you couldn't turn off; an absolute nuisance as the  bathroom door is made of glass. The lights were very bright and prevented us from sleeping. When I rang reception about them I was told they would go off automatically in 15 mins as they were on a timer. So we waited. About 30 mins later they went off but came on again every time we used the bathroom and stayed on for an eternity.
In fairness, great glazing in the hotel meant that we didn't hear any road noise but hardly any soundproofing between rooms meant we were woken on a few occasions by the crazy person in the room next door.
On a positive note the tiny room was very clean, there was a good tv, the pillows were good, the shower was good and the hotel is only a few minutes walk from Stephen's Green. For us, however, the negatives far outweigh the positives and after a terrible nights sleep we vowed we would never stay there again.",2,2022,02,15
243,Amazing hotel great location,"Just back after a two night stay in Dublin , Hotel was amazing had everything you need so close to the city centre , the staff were so helpful could honestly not do enough for you , we had drinks wt the bar the first night and the waitress was more than happy to turn a football match on the TV for my partner , will definitely be back",5,2022,02,13
243,Weekend in Dublin,"We recently stayed in this hotel on a Saturday.

The hotel is perfectly located for exploring the city and for doing some retail therapy",4,2022,02,07
243,"Better Hotels In The Area, Nice Sleep Is What You Will Get ! Bad Bad Service","We came here for Our Engagement as a last minute gift to ourselves. We where not offered or congratulated at any point despite letting them know.

-Issues with Porter, making us feel uncomfortable, put his hand in my face and told me to stand back, because I was not wearing a mask, although we where informed upon check in, we didn’t need to wear masks. He said we needed to read the guidelines, all
The time wearing his mask wrong not covering his nose.

-Bar Man scooping ice with hands , touching inside of glasses and touching fruit with hands and not using a thong, the drinks are expensive and terrible quality

-Rooms are small, but perfect, the beds are unbelievable, so comfy and the hotel decor is fab! Bar area is stunning and the price of the food is amazing, very good value!

Wouldn’t advise you to stay here, but avoid the bar for drinks, avoid the Porter, and don’t expect anything special for an anniversary. If these things don’t bother you that’s fine, you will have a great sleep!

I would like to single out Clare she was fab, we was the night cleaner, 2 lovely people we dealt with. We reported the above to the “manager” who didn’t really seem fussed, just apologised. 

We felt our stay was totally tarnished",2,2022,01,31

243,Lovely hotel .  We loved our stay in a modern very compact hotel room.,We had a lovely stay in the hotel. It was our Christmas treat to ourselves.  We were able to walk around Dublin where we met many years ago for the first time. The Hotel is worth a visit. The rooms are very modern. You have everything to hand. It is very safe and comfortable space. It was really cosy.  It is well worth researching and seeing if it fits your budget. The location is ideal. Plenty of places to see and visit.  Really nice staff that will look after you.    ,5,2022,01,03
243,Modern hotel in a brilliant location.,"Very modern well finished hotel a minutes walk from Grafton street. Beds are extremely comfortable and room was well finished. Some nice touches in the executive rooms like massive wall of windows with views over the city, built in sound in the bathroom and excellent tv that can be easily mirrored to your phone which was very handy. Would highly recommend for a night out in town as only minutes walk to to Camden street or if you want to enjoy some shopping and food.",5,2022,01,03
243,A great dinner in the Canteen!,"What a fabulous dinner at the canteen restaurant last week. Delicious seasonal food washed down with some good wines! Felt really comfortable and safe too.  We will definitely be back. Thanks to all the staff 
Alan",5,2021,12,21
243,Calm and comfort in the city centre,A well designed room. The bed was large and comfortable with good quality bedding. The bathroom was extremely clean and well designed. Not a large space but plenty for a comfortable stay. Everything that you could want was there. The blinds meant a good dark room and the soundproofing did it’s job. The bar felt modern and inviting. Breakfast was first class with plenty of choice. Would highly recommend ,5,2021,12,18
243,"Awful, Tiny bedroom.","Awful. Tiny, tiny bedroom. Bed only accessible from one side. Every time the next room moved in their bed our wall moved and the bed. 
2 guests, 1 towel…rang down for more, 45 minutes to arrive by which time we both had showers and shared a towel. Water from shower flooded the bathroom and out into bedroom…no bath mat either…floor was then lethal. 
No soap provided…in the middle of a pandemic!!!! Check in and out was quick and staff were helpful at these times.
I certainly will not stay here again and wouldn’t advise anyone else to either.",1,2021,12,13
243,Marlin Hotel,"Great experience at the Marlin. Exec room was fantastic. Food at Canteen was incredible. Staff very helpful and friendly.  Would definitely return to this gorgeous gem in centre of Dublin. Close to Grafton St, shopping and bars and a ton of things to see and do. 
",5,2021,12,13
243,"Nice hotel, just don’t eat here!",Great location for a city stay. Very poor service in bar and restaurant. They were understaffed and unexperienced. Rooms were comfortable. Difficulty getting parking but it was a Saturday before Christmas. ,3,2021,12,13
243,Great location and great hotel!,"The hotel was great, the location was perfect, right beside grafting street for shopping and restaurants. The hotel was spotless, the rooms are compact but the have everything that you need. We had drinks in the bar and it had a great atmosphere! ",5,2021,12,10
243,Christmas night,Great location fab rooms staff were very friendly. We have stayed in dublin many times in different hotels costing far more that the marlin and would place it at the top of the list of hotels to stay in dublin.,5,2021,12,07
243,"Avoid the wine, but not necessary for a great nights sleep.",Extremely comfortable bed with one of the  best nights sleep I’ve had in a while. No tea/coffee facilities in room. Delicious food but wine let it down being possibly corked. Quite disappointing as it was not cheap either. However overall an enjoyable stay in a great location.,4,2021,12,06
243,Marlin Hotel,Very nice hotel. Great location for city Centre adventure. Very easy to fond and navigate the check in process. Breakfast was very nice although I would recommend a second coffee maker to avoid queuing ,4,2021,12,06
243,It's all good!,"This is an easy review.
From arriving to a friendly,smartly dressed, efficient guy, to spotless rooms and an eagerness to help, this is probably the best hotel I've stayed in for a city break. A discounted Q Park is one minute away.
Checkout was just as easy and, again the guys were efficient and helpful.
I would return without a moment's hesitation.",5,2021,11,29
243,Pleasant surprise,"Recently stayed one night, very competitive price (€119). Basic room, very clean, great shower and the most comfortable (2m x 2km) hotel bed I have EVER slept in. Soft pillows, large flat screen tv, complimentary water bottles. Excellent helpful, friendly staff. Whole place decked out in an exquisite contemporary/abstract style. Highly recommended",5,2021,11,27
243,I’ll be back!!,"The hotel staff were so welcoming, the system for retrieving keys is digital but there are so many staff around to help, all staff were so welcoming and couldn’t help out enough. The whole hotel was so boujee and the room was amazing- super clean and just overall beautiful. Definitely an experience I’ll not forget, and I’ll be back to enjoy it again! It’s super close to all the shopping in Dublin, so not only is it a fabulous hotel, it’s also super handy! Thanks to all the staff who made our stay as amazing as it was :)",5,2021,11,26
243,short stay in Dublin,"hadn't heard of this hotel and was looking for somewhere central.  Great choice as location is great.  Bit strange checking in using a touch pad rather than with a person, but i got over that!   Any staff that we did encounter are so warm, welcoming and efficient.  Room was quite small but really comfortable and bathroom had lovely L'Occitane toiletries.   There isn't a view from the room as the window was high and looked out on roofs, but the bed was so comfy.   Would definitely stay again",5,2021,11,23
243,Short Dublin stay,"Fantastic hotel,clean,comfortable and excellent staff . Location superb..highly recommend rooms were described as cosy ( compact) but they offered everything you need. The only downside (again just a personal preference) is coffee/tea facilities in room, otherwise a superb overnight stay.. great value for money with excellent breakfast included.",5,2021,11,15
243,Incredibly Professional and Respectful Staff,"We stayed here very recently along with around 10 friends as part of a night out. 
The interiors of this hotel from the moment you walk in are beautiful and modern. The location could not be better, it is extremely central, close to a great shopping street, restaurants and bars. 
We had all booked separately (some on booking websites and some directly with the hotel) the prices were reasonable, but the rooms tended to differ, some rooms were quite small in comparison to others, our only criticism would be that the room rate paid by some parties directly with the hotel was actually more expensive and did not include benefits such as breakfast. (We all booked on the same day just across different websites)
We spent a few hours in the trendy hotel bar (rugby match) where the food, drinks and staff were exceptional. The bar was quite busy, despite running around, the staff were very accommodating, polite and helpful, it is a very well run bar and I would definitely visit again even if I wasn't staying just for their whiskey sours alone. 

One of main reasons for writing this review is what happened after we returned to our room to get ready for dinner...on returning to our room, I genuinely felt as though our belongs had been disturbed, the wardrobe door left open exposing the safe increased my suspicions (I am normally very cautious to zip up bags fully, close doors etc when leaving hotel rooms due to a past experience) I checked and could see nothing missing (although there would have been nothing of value in our room) we noticed there was a camera directly outside our room so we brought our concerns to the reception, they were incredibly professional, the manager Jade took our concerns very seriously and straight away got the camera footage checked, she was so polite, and came to our room, downloaded the card key log from the card key system on our door, within a few minutes she was able to confirm that the footage had been checked and the card key log confirmed no one had entered our room. 
Of course needless to say I was extremely embarrassed and apologetic, but not once was I was made to feel uncomfortable or like I had inconvenienced them (which I had, by inadvertently wasting their time) I feel like the situation was handled in a very professional manner, and although I felt like I wanted the ground to swallow me whole, the professionalism and reassurance shown to me by the manager meant that I managed to keep my dignity intact.  
Thank you for a wonderful stay.",5,2021,11,14
243,Poor value for money,"Very poor value for money, extremely small room with no appliances like kettle,  thea or coffee 
Very poor breakfast, absolutely no consideration for anyone with food allergies,  no choice of non dairy orgluten free",1,2021,11,12
243,Hotel near Stephen's Green,"Excellent city centre location close to Stephen's Green 
Rooms very clean and beds extremely comfortable 
Staff friendly and helpful - when available but not enough staff available to help with issues at check in and check out 

",5,2021,11,08
243,Nice and new hotel. Well designed. Good location.,Enjoyable stay in a new and modern hotel. Good location close to Stephen's Green and Grafton Street. Helpful staff. Nice food in the restaurant. Self check-in was good and convenient so no need to queue on arrival. I would be happy to recommend.,5,2021,11,07
243,Unpleasant experience,A guy at the reception looked at me from top to bottom when I checked in as if I couldn’t afford to stay at the hotel or something. What a rude way to greet your customer. Not the best experience I’ve had with a 4-star hotel. ,3,2021,11,06
243,Ladies weekend,My mam and her friend went up to watch a show in the gatiey and it was in a perfect location just around the corner and in walkin distance from the shopping centre to booked on Booking.com but they didn’t accept cash for when they had to pay at the property card only so just be careful ,4,2021,11,05
243,Perfect Short Stay,Must stay if you're looking to be close to the city center. Close enough to everything you might want to see but far enough away from the busy/loud areas. Clean room and great food/drinks in the restaurant. Easy check in and knowledgeable staff.,5,2021,11,01
243,Mother & daughter,"Staff are so helpful & friendly, cleanliness of rooms, comfortable bed, fabulous shower, lovely decor, great reception area, great location, would definitely recommend ,& definitely stay here again. Loved this hotel,",5,2021,10,29
243,Weekend stay,We stayed here for a Friday night in the city. Brilliant hotel with the perfect location. Car park is directly opposite the hotel and was very cheap for city centre parking. We loved the hotel room and can’t wait to come back. ,5,2021,10,28
243,Would stay again,"Lovely hotel, great location near shops , bars and theatre. Really friendly staff. Only gripe I would have and to be honest its the same in a lot of hotels there was very little choice if your diet is plant based.
Wouldn't stop me staying here again I just would not pay for breakfast.",4,2021,10,19
243,Review,"Good location near all the  shopping areas .Also close to the luas.The rooms could have been cleaner to be honest.The staff did their best .Everything was fair, nothing overly impressive .Modern interior but just felt a little bit cold no Cosy feel to it.Worth a visit anyway",3,2021,10,15
243,Good central location for weekend in Dublin,"Spent two nights on a business trip here and booked a superior room. It was a good hotel, with good breakfast and bar. Not luxury but contemporary and maybe trying a bit too hard with the online check in.  We enjoyed it nonetheless and was 5 mins from St Stephen's Green. Only comment is that the rooms are small, even the superior. So if you don't like small rooms or are claustrophobic maybe avoid the hotel. We are talking Hong Kong small. Nonetheless a good stay with great, polite staff.",4,2021,10,15
243,Lovely hotel,"Special thanks to Jade and Raul who were so friendly and helpful, with some really great recommendations and knowledge of the area. The hotel is lovely and it’s also really clean. Great location for some shopping or dining out.",5,2021,10,12
243,Poor service,"Great location, but unfortunately I cannot say anything else in favour of this hotel. Room was without exception the smallest hotel room i have ever stayed in .
Bad attitude amongst bar and restaurant staff",1,2021,10,11
243,Good Location,"Hotel is in a great location that’s very central to all the main sights in the city.  Rooms are small, practical and functional.  Check in was confusing as my dates were wrongfully recorded on the hotel system.  A less than pleasant discussion with a member of staff resolved this.  Room allocated had just been vacated and wasn’t cleaned.  Another more helpful member of staff quickly resolved this.  Overall service was good and hotel was clean.  Not sure I would pay full price for it though.",3,2021,09,28
243,"Lovely setting and location, Marred by a myriad of issues.","My girlfriend and I visited the hotel recently for a much needed weekend break away.

Upon arrival we mentioned to the receptionist on duty that we had credit from a previous booking which was unfortunately cancelled due to the pandemic. We were told we could not use the credit as we had rebooked with a third party booking service and not with the reservations team by email. This was not explained to us in the original emails with reservations about the credit. We were told it won’t be possible to use the credit multiple times before the receptionist told us to take a seat so she could email the reservations manager. We waited 15 minutes at the check in seating before we were offered to check into our room. 
After an hour of settling in and unpacking we were told that the credit could be used and we were then refunded the amount of credit. 
This reception didn’t make us feel very welcome. we just felt it was unnecessarily difficult for something I’m sure has been dealt with before, but we appreciate it was resolved in due course.

On the second night we returned to our room around 11:30 as the restrictions closed the bars early. We had enjoyed a good night in Dublin and we were ready for bed. When we got to the room our electrics didn’t work, so we phoned down to reception and they sent up a porter who was efficient and professional. He tested our electrics, and couldn't get them to work so he offered to move us to a nee room. We were grateful for the offer as we wanted to sleep and it was 12:00am at this point. We then packed our bags and waited for someone to come.

After about 45 minutes of waiting and trying not to fall asleep. We tried to phone reception 4 times to no avail. I then physically went down to reception and seen there was a busy reception bar. The night manager approached me and I found him extremely unprofessional. The porter explained the problem with the electricity and manager turned around to me and said “lets go” which, after 45 minutes of waiting for him to simply come up and give us a new room key, I found these choice of words very arrogant. I was expecting an apology for the waste of our time. 

He followed me to our room and asked us “why we weren’t down in the bar having a drink” which, if I wanted too, I couldn’t have availed of the opportunity as I was left waiting in my room with no electric, for 3 quarters of an hour. 
He tried our electrics again with the key card, which I felt was just unnecessary as clearly this was the first thing me, my girlfriend and the porter had tested multiple times 45 minutes before he had. I just feel his demeanour in the reception made it seem like he thought it was an issue on our end and not the hotels.

Eventually we got a new room and I would like to congratulate the porter as he was genuinely very professional. He also offered to carry our bags etc from our old room to our new one. A service which was not offered by the manager who simply told us to leave our luggage in the room and collect it in the morning.

All in all the hotel location and setting cannot be faulted, but I just feel there was a lack of hospitality and professionalism on offer, and would expect much more from a 4 star hotel. 

Kind Regards, Bradley and Samantha",2,2021,09,26
243,Canteen - Dublins best…..,"Great centrally located contemporary Hotel.  However, Canteen is the hidden gem.   Absolutely fabulous food created by James Sheridan.  We followed him from the original restaurant in celbridge and the experience was even better.  A gourmet treat.  Canteen is not on trip advisor so putting review here under Marlin. Highly recommend an overnight and dinner in one of Dublins best Restaurants.",5,2021,09,16
243,Good location downtown,"The Marlin hotel provides an excellent base to visit Dublin city from the center. The check-in process is relatively fast, and the quality of the room accommodation is good. A place to recommend for a nice week-end !",5,2021,09,14
243,Overnight Break,"We stayed at the Marlin for an overnight trip to Dublin. The location is amazing. One of the most central hotels in Dublin. 

The hotel aesthetic was brilliant. Very modern and fun. My toddler loved the giant tree in the lobby.

We liked the option for self check in. Makes life easier while trying to social distance. Staff were very friendly. 

We will definitely be back ",5,2021,09,12
243,Perfect stay,"I had the BEST stay at The Marlin. The room was great, I miss the comfy bed and the blackout shades. The staff was very nice and helpful whenever I needed anything. The hotel is extremely walkable to anything you want to do in Dublin. I can’t recommend this hotel and enough. ",5,2021,09,09
243,Very comfortable rooms and excellent location,The location of this hotel is just perfect. Is is very central making all of Dublin accessible by foot. The rooms are small but very comfortable and modern. The bed and pillows are particularly comfy. Staff are friendly too. Highly recommended.,5,2021,09,08
243,Modern comfortable hotel with great location and price,Very good location just behind College of Surgeons. I minute walk to St Stephens Green. Modern hotel with very comfortable quiet rooms with comfortable beds.Friendly and helpful staff. Nicely decorated bar and restaurant.  ,5,2021,09,07
243,Perfect location for enjoying Dublin,"Great hotel in the heart of Dublin - spotlessly clean and the staff could not have been more helpful. The room layouts are a little different so if you’re fussy about that check out the photos before you book but quite honestly if you’re planning on shopping / eating out / drinking in Dublin this would be hard to beat.

Breakfast was good too - obviously a bit more challenging with the restrictions but food was tasty and hot.",5,2021,09,06
243,10th wedding anniversary,"Where do I start so we had to ask twice for clean towels & toilet roll as we had none for 1 day had to use the main toilets in the hotel not only this the cleaner had been in the day before cleaned nothing but left 2 mugs strange

The service in this hotel is basic not worth the 660 euro paid I would of got the same standard of service in a travel lodge not even a hairdryer 

Also the fact the don’t accept cash when checking in but don’t tell you before hand when booking 
We picked this hotel for our 10th wedding anniversary as we thought it had so much potential but we’re actually really disappointed 
 
They need to sort the lights in the bathroom it is censored lights & goes off every 40 seconds not good when taking a shower 

Tried enjoying a nice wee cocktail in the garden area a basically got made to feel bad about ordering drinks got told at least 4 times well the bar closes at 11 but I want to get area cleaned so I’ll need you to move inside by 10:30 even though it’s open till 11 made no sense 

Basically we’re really dissatisfied with our stay here wanted something really nice for our 10th wedding anniversary to have nice  memories this wasn’t the place unfortunately",2,2021,09,06
243,"Great hotel, small rooms & weird bed arrangement.","We stayed here 3 different times on a recent trip. Great location…near the Green, Grafton St., Trinity College. Great friendly, helpful staff. Excellent breakfast included. Bar & restaurant unremarkable. Rooms and especially bathrooms were very small and beds are placed in an alcove so you have to literally leap into the bed or climb over your partner…this was the biggest negative. Otherwise good clean accommodations in a safe neighborhood with plenty of restaurants, bars & shopping nearby.",4,2021,09,06
243,Great Hotel. Excellent Staff. Perfect location. Definitely a place to stay when in Dublin.,"Loved this hotel. From the quirky decor, to the excellent staff, to the really central location. The room was compact but very clean, the bed was very comfortable, and the shower room was spotless. We didn’t eat in the hotel so I cannot comment on that. Nothing to complain about.",5,2021,09,05
243,A gem in the city centre,Location excellent.  Right in the  middle of Dublin main shopping area.  Very clean.  The bed was so comfortable.  I want that  mattress  . The location is very quiet even though we were in the city cdntre. Parking in the Q park across the road at a discount.  We will definitely be back. ,5,2021,09,05
243,Fabulous hotel but very much lacking any human interaction.,"Loved the hotel, the rooms, the location, and the value.  However there was very little human interaction and we felt the lack of this.  The check in was fiddly and took much longer than a human check in would have, getting a quick cup of tea (given there is no tea/coffee making facility in the rooms) took forever and was very expensive, finding someone to ask about late check out took a long time as no one was around, and finally, we got no help at all when my daughter left her bed socks behind. Shame, because the physical hotel was lovely, but the lack of human interaction ruined the experience for me. ",3,2021,09,04
243,Couldn’t recommend more!,"The staff here are amazing, so friendly and more and accommodating. The location of the Marlin is amazing, we even returned to our room if we needed to use the bathroom! Our room was massive and spotlessly clean. Will definitely be returning and staying here whenever we are in Dublin. Thanks so much.",5,2021,09,04
243,Nice modern hotel with attention to detail,Would recommend as it caters for all age groups architecture and design is stunning this would have been a 5 but we arrived at 23.30 at night for a 2 night stay and when I originally booked I explained this but had to pay 50 euros to check out at 4pm due to our flight times hotel wasn’t busy so I thought a good will gesture would have been a better option but I would stay again due to location and hotel cleanliness staff exceptional ,4,2021,08,30
243,Perfect Stay with friends,"Excellent hotel at an excellent location. Checked in with ease, staff were very friendly and welcoming. Bar was just as great, great selection of cocktails. My go-to hotel for when I’m staying in Dublin with friends from now on! See you soon guys!",5,2021,08,30
243,Absolutely disappointing,"Total mess in breakfast as only one single person to fill plates with food for people standing in line, 15-20 queue persons at 9-10 am, also just few things to choose, no buffet at all, no fresh fruit, terrible coffe machine full of spilled coffe, and another person to do tables, so as a result, no way to get a decent plate of food and tables full of dirty items.
I asked for fully refund of breakfast to have a decent one somewhere else.
Also only every three nights room was made and no warning about it in advance, as I would have chosen another hotel or solution. 
I didn't leave after the first night cause it was already paid and no refund would have been given",1,2021,08,29
243,Not a great stay,"The team at Marlin are not helpful at all.
When arrived we have been given a accessible room, I asked for another room but was told 50% of exec rooms are accessible and they have no options available. No offer to maybe suggest another room category even if I needed to pay more. The lady kept saying the same thing.
We have been out all day and our room has not been cleaned, asked front desk and got no response or apologies. 
I appreciate that hotels don’t have staff and are struggling but then tell guest what to expect or at least try and be nice.",1,2021,08,27
243,Poor Customer Service,"Hotel would not offer a refund from a booking made early in 2020 where travel was not permitted from the UK. Tried to to work with the hotel but when it became clear the additional cost of travel to Ireland would make the stay not cost effective, they refused to entertain a monetary refund.",1,2021,08,27
243,Best Hotel by a Long Shot,"From check-in to check-out, I  can't fault Marlin everything was seamless!! Location is amazing so central to everything. From reception staff to bar staff they go above and beyond to ensure that all you needs are met and are probably the most friendliest staff I have encountered.  Food and drink  in the bar was really good  had fish and chips and a few cocktail to wash it down. The room was big, spacious and the bed was so comfortable didn't want to get out of in the morning. Marlin will be my 1st port of call when I stay in Dublin next",5,2021,08,25
243,Loved it ! 10/10,"Super clean. Food and cocktails top class. Staff are observant & friendly. 
Perfect location for visiting Dublin. Trendy interiors. Can't wait to book a stay again with friends. Very family friendly also.",5,2021,08,25
243,Really Enjoyed my Stay!,"I spent one night at the Marlin Hotel in August 2021 and would definitely book again. Very reasonably priced for such a central location. My room was spotlessly clean, bright and well air conditioned and the bed was very comfortable. The standard of customer service was excellent. I booked and paid through Hotels.com but was charged again for the room at check in so if you book through a third party website just be sure to mention to staff that you have already paid and have a receipt ready. Reception staff processed my refund no problem and were very apologetic and helpful. It would have been nice to have tea and coffee making facilities in my room but apart from that everything was perfect, thank you for a lovely night! ",4,2021,08,24
243,Marlin Hotel,"Stayed in a standard room for two, fantastic price for the hospitality, room, facilities, and everything in between. We were taken- aback when entering the room, Highly recommend to anyone who is looking for a hotel to stay in Dublin City",5,2021,08,23
243,Amazing stay,"This hotel is so gorgeous and is in an amazing location. The king room was cosy and modern, and the bed was the cosiest bed ever! The staff were so kind and helpful. I will definitely stay here again.",5,2021,08,23
243,Fantastic,"Staff were amazing, friendly and very helpful. Room was great, spacious and comfortable. I booked the suite and it didn't disappoint. Separate bedroom from lounge area. Flat screen in both rooms. Very clean ",5,2021,08,23
243,Great stay,Lovely hotel in great location. Comfortable rooms and good food. Only dropped a star because of breakfast arrangements with set of serving implements not separated for vegetarian items/ meat ( already drawn to attention of management).,4,2021,08,22
243,Minimal,Cant really say much only spent a few hours there sleeping but great hotel top of the line facilities and staff as well as food also the fact that i was there for such a short time any comments  make wouldnt be noteworthy in my opinion,5,2021,08,20
243,Staycation,Spent a night in this hotel. It was enjoyable as I have already said during this time of covid 19 restrictions I look forward to seeing what they open when restrictions are gone. Everything was fine except that a 24hr tea and coffee station or provision is really needed.,4,2021,08,18
243,Amazing,"Myself and my partner had an amazing stay at the Marlin Hotel. We stayed for 2 nights and we loved every minute of it. The hotel is beautiful, very clean and well kept. Staff are all lovely & very kind. We can not wait for our next stay! ",4,2021,08,17
243,A good central hotel to stay when in Dublin,"A lovely central place to stay, good staff and very clean and modern. Room was small but adequate. Stayed for two nights but room was not cleaned on day 2.

This was not a deal breaker for us. Lovely comfortable bed and soft white linen sheets. 

Would stay again - Yes for sure.",5,2021,08,15
243,"Excellent, City centre, Ultra Modern Hotel",Great very modern Hotel. Bedroom and Bathroom very tasteful designed. Extremely central. Staff were great. Very pleasant Bar Courtyard. Easy to drive to with Parking directly across the road with Guest discount. Quirky themed Lobby. Very well priced for this standard and location.,5,2021,08,14
243,Excellent spot,Loved it here. Fresh and modern and close to a huge range of shops. Travelled with my teenager who enjoyed it hugely. Can’t wait to return with my adult friends and enjoy the cocktails in the garden. Close to the Luas also so you can explore dublin itself. ,5,2021,08,12
243,Dublin in 5be Marlin Hotel,"Enjoyable overnight stay.Hotel is not easy to drive to, one way system is awkward.Car park across the road and discounted for guests is a big bonus.Did. To avail of dining or breakfast, time was pushed.Staff very helpful, Connection with Television seems wonky, forgot to mention to staff.Very handy location for Dublin Castle and major shopping areas.",4,2021,08,11
243,Perfect location! Nice and cosy.,"We stayed in the Marlin for a three day long weekend in Dublin, and it was perfect! The Cozy King room was great for the short stay, but if we were going to stay any longer we'd get a larger room, maybe with a bar fridge, to store water and drinks throughout the trip.

Check in and check out was easy with the self serve kiosks, and the staff was always available if needed, but never pushy. The bed was comfortable and we both had an excellent sleep thanks to the blackout curtain/blind situation. Our entertainment unit didn't really work- the USB chargers did, but the Bluetooth music system didn't, which wasn't really an issue. Our TV also would cut out and be laggy a few times a day, but we didn't really use the TV for entertainment, it was more background noise.

Of course, the location is primo, and for the convenience of being steps away from the heart of Dublin, we will stay at the Marlin everytime. ",5,2021,08,09
243,"Fantastic hotel, amazing staff","Fantastic hotel, amazing staff who were so friendly and accommodating. We had to reschedule our trip/wedding bookings numerous times for both ourselves and guests and nothing was too much trouble. Would highly recommend without any hesitation. ",5,2021,08,08
243,Great service,"I have yet to stay at the hotel, but just want to drop a review to thank Lisa and Grame from the Reservation team for their great service. My reservation was postponed due to Covid since March 2020 and had to make few changes due to Covid, they have been very helpful and flexible, I do feel the need to mention this because back of house employees do rarely receive any mention when they did a good job 👍",5,2021,08,07
243,Luxury in city centre,Fantastic location. Friendly and helpful staff who were available but not overbearing. Fabulous food and beautiful environment. Clean room. Fantastic breakfast options. Room was a fantastic size and was incredible clean. It is a very modern environment but was very comfortable.,5,2021,08,06
243,Not welcoming,"Really really nice and clean place but apart from that the staff was not welcoming apart from two staff members (one in which was Stacie). Stacie had to do the other girls job as she talked to the manager all night practically ,I honestly don’t know how a manager can be so lazy and unprofessional to his staff and to customers.

When we came down for dinner the manager was very rude and didn’t work at all until another manager appeared during the night .",1,2021,08,06
243,Chintzy,Teeny tiny room (7 feet wide) with the bed wedged in at the end of the room.  Had to crawl onto the bed from the foot/side.  No real space for luggage.  Three hangers for clothes; no closet.  No coffee or tea-making facilities.  When we got coffee from the dining room (a machine) they charged us 3 euros!  Had to ask for more toilet paper.  Do NOT recommend.,2,2021,08,05
243,Good,"Room was small but bed, pillows and blanket comfortable. Needs at least a small fridge. TV signal constantly jumping.  Food at hotel was not good and very over priced. Staff were lovely. You could not hear people on either side of you which was great. Good walking distance to shops.  ",4,2021,08,05
243,Excellent Location and Spotless,"Love this Hotel, have stayed a few times and will stay again.  It's central location, professonal and friendly staff, it's modern and quirky decor and the food in the restaurant is very good.  Beware that some of the bedrooms are just pod/dorm like rooms so if you want a free standing bed make sure to pay for the upgrade.  ",5,2021,08,05
243,They try so hard to be cool that it is very lame and poor,"The hotel has a spectacular location, steps away from Grafton St
Rooms are small but very efficient and great comfortable beds
Problem is that they pretend to be cool so hard, that it is painfully lame
You check in with a machine but EVERYBODY needs help so the poor guys at the non existent front desk have to help you check in anyway
They are also abusing (like many other hotels) covid restriction to cut services
Breakfast is terrible, with a small buffet for juice and croissants but no buffet for the rest of the food but rather they give yu a dirty paper where you can choose a main dish, and they taste as bad as that paper
The also refuse to give away maps of the city under the pretext of covid even though every other hotel and attraction is giving away maps
Service is smug, the guys at the virtual front desk belive they are cool...but they are not
If you just want a good location and room this is perfect, if you care about service and food this hotel is not for you",3,2021,08,04
243,Perfect spot in Dublin!,"I would not choose another place to stay at in Dublin, location is fantastic, I would like also to mention that all staff are so professional, efficient, helpful, and friendly. 
It is my first time in Ireland, and in Dublin.  

James the front house manager is greatly helpful, I lost my phone in between window and frame, (yes it was an unexpected fall for the phone) and he made sure that the maintenance professional is in property first thing in the morning, and he was able to retreive my phone .. I was also getting their feedback on everything and they never hesitate to guide you and help you. 

Yolanda welcomed me when I arrived, what a wonderful personality, Cheerful and welcoming, 

Patrick and the crew in the restaurant are wonderful fella!! Beside providing you with great options in the restaurant, they also were my reference in the city where to go what to eat (especially if you like seafood).. 

If I names them one by one, without exaggerating, they made me feel like home when it is a new country and place for me... 

The property is comfortable, so modern, and you can charge your computer wherever you go.. The lobby is such a nice place to work at, they have also a library beside the restaurant with comfortable Sofa'a ,, ,great place to read and work..  

With no hesitation,, this is the place to stay if you are in Dublin!!!

243,A great night away,"We decided to treat ourselves to dinner in town and an overnight stay.  The hotel is really well located, so close to everything.  The room was spotless and really quiet.  A great nights sleep.  All the staff we encountered during our stay were very friendly and helpful.  We would stay again and recommend to others ",5,2021,08,03
243,"Great Hotel, clean room and overall great experience!",I loved the entire stay from start to finish! It was a very clean and modern hotel. The staff were extremely helpful. The check-in process was simple and easy. I will absolutely be coming back to the Marlin Hotel again soon.,5,2021,08,02
243,No frills but superb finish,"Great hotel, very impersonal, self check-in, lovely modern and spacious lobby, well designed and lovely finish to everything. Rooms good, bathrooms excellent although doors bang on closing and can’t be fixed open. Self serve coffee in the morning is not great ",4,2021,08,01
243,Fab location & lovely staff,"First impressions when entering the hotel were fab, the lobby area is designed to an exceptionally high standard and is warm, vibrant and very welcoming. On arrival we were given an extremely friendly welcome by the front of house staff, this theme ran throughout our entire stay - all staff members really couldn't do enough for you, they were all super friendly and helpful. 
The location is perfect for exploring the south side of the city with a number of bars, restaurants and places of interest right of the Marlins doorstep.
We stayed in a 'cosy king room', the room was really modern with an amazingly comfy bed that was perfectly positioned for watching the flat screen TV. The shower was powerful and there's a small light under the sink unit that comes on automatically so there's no need to turn the light on during the night.
The bar area is modern with a lovely relaxed atmosphere, there's also an outside terrace area which I imagine is really nice to enjoy a drink from when the sun is shining. The gym is small and compact but all equipment is good quality and very clean with fresh drinking water tap and towels available. 
The negatives were the lack of storage in the room, there wasn't a wardrobe or cupboard so we ended up keeping our clothes in our suitcases and there wasn't any tea/coffee making facilities (I love a brew in the morning when getting ready). We also didn't have anybody from house keeping tend to our room in the 3 days we were there, we had to ask at the front desk for fresh towels who told us that the house keeping team clean the rooms every other day.
On the whole we had a great stay at the Marlin and I would definitely recommend it to others paying a visit to Dublin.",4,2021,07,31
243,Wow,"This hotel is one of the best hotels I’ve stayed at!! From the amazing decor to the kindest most amazing staff, unfortunately I never got the staffs names but this one guy joked with us about taking a Insta pic ( he was so nice) he made us feel very welcomed in the restaurant, and the staff at reception they were so lovely, honestly the hotel could’ve been horrible and the staff would’ve made it amazing… would 100000% recommend ",5,2021,07,31
243,Great cozy stay in central location,"The room and location can't be beat. Room was cozy and had a massive bed, which was a plus, as well as a great TV with simple instructions to connect to via chromecast for spotify /netflix. Excellent shower and Air Con.

Only criticism is that the hotel only has a single vending machine located in -1, and it was a it was a bit sparse, but this is a minimal issue solved by planning ahead and grabbing drinks or snacks from Dunnes Stores in Stephens Green shopping centre directly across the street.",5,2021,07,30
243,"Review of the Marlin Hotel , Dublin",Delighted with our trip to Dublin and our stay in the Marlin Hotel The convenience to the city was important. Found staff to be very friendly and helpful. The decor of the hotel is classy and the lovely meals. Room was clean and quiet and beds were very comfortable.,5,2021,07,29
243,Fab location with hotel to match,"Stayed one night to meet up with family and staying at the Marlin added an extra shine.  Great outdoor space,  short but tasty menu, funky bar and lounge areas and super comfortable room.  Will be very happy to return in October : )",5,2021,07,29
243,"After a lockdown, the first thing you see on your hotel stay is a check-in machine","The hotel is nice and well located, but the fact that the check-in machine is the first contact you have, that it is not intuitive and you need to request support from a human anyway, it is just a waste of electricity, which in the current carbon climate cycle is not good. 
Friday I had a lovely stay, Saturday night it was ""Greeks vs. Trojans"" with techno, as every room and floor was flooded with party youngsters, since the city does not sell alcohol past 11.30 pm apart from hotels. Had I gone with that spirit I would have loved the ""Benidorm experience"" in Dublin, but I just found that it was too much, and that really impacted my stay. My suggestion, raise the prices per night...",2,2021,07,26
243,Good,"Lovely hotel, great staff but when I got to my room it was dusty and unclean food crumbs on the floor as well as hair, had to be changed to a different room, bar and outdooor area was very nice and staff at the bar where nice.",4,2021,07,26
243,Stay,"Very good service m, very friendly staff room was very clean and perfect for what we needed this will be our go to hotel to stay in future very affordable prices great quality over all. Highly recommend ",5,2021,07,25
243,.,I stayed in the marlin Hotel for 3 nights and it was very good. The staff are very helpful. The food is very good and the rooms are very spacious and comfortable. I especially love having a chromecast in the room ,4,2021,07,25
243,Would stay again,Perfect location and very clean modern hotel. We were looking for a decent hotel in the city centre at a good price and the Marlin had Everything we could have asked for. Staff were all very helpful.Highly recommend this hotel,5,2021,07,21
243,Cool and convenient,The staff here are very friendly and do what they can to help you and make you feel comfortable. The room was immaculate with a super comfy bed. And i loved the cool modern decor. Location is great too. Will definitely stay again. ,5,2021,07,21
243,Rooms are fab but bad service in restaurant and bar,"The room was amazing but the fact as residents we were told to sit in the lobby to have drinks and couldn’t have food because they apparently had no seats available in the bar or restaurant even though non residents were seated there was very disappointing, I enquired about booking in for food at a later time to be told we could but he never offered that to us only I asked we wouldn’t have been aware that it was even possible to get a table, having to sit in a cold lobby with no music, food or atmosphere was not what I had in mind for a nice night away and to have to keep getting up and down from the lobby to go to the bar wasn’t ideal with the covid regulations, table service wasn’t available in the lobby. Very let down by the service and considering how much we paid for one night we at least thought we’d be accommodated for in the hotel or at least advised that booking for the restaurant was advised but we weren’t made aware of this and it wasn’t written anywhere. ",3,2021,07,20
243,Great hotel,"Very nice hotel well situated to shops and restaurants in the city centre. Staff very friendly and helpful. Breakfast service was very good, bar menu could have been better. Very enjoyable visit. Would go back and stay again.",5,2021,07,20
243,A Nice Surprise,"My friend and myself stayed one night in this hotel. I really liked this hotel. The staff are just lovely; very friendly and accommodating. The layout of the foyer is open, welcoming and very funky. The room was small but well planned and very comfortable. It could could do with tea-coffee making facilities. Overall, I was very impressed. ",5,2021,07,20
243,Fantastic!,"We had a wonderful 2 night stay in the Marlin. The room has everything you need along with the comfiest bed and a fab shower. The breakfast was excellent. We had a drink in the bar both nights, they have a huge drinks menu. The staff were very friendly. The location is just perfect for Sightseeing and St Stephen’s Green car park is just across from the hotel. We’ll definitely be returning on our next visit to Dublin.",5,2021,07,19
243,Eat at Canteen!,"We haven't visited Dublin since Christmas of 2019! My partner had been following the reviews of the restaurant Canteen on Twitter. So it made sense to book the merlin in order to enjoy this restaurant and eat ""indoors"" We paid €169 for a superior King room. From previous experience  in hotels you'd expect a superior room. The bed was against the wall so only access to get in and out was either climb over the other person or slide out of the end of the bed. The TV was hanging crooked/sideways and the coffee/kettle sockets didn't work. My partner informed reception the first time he said he was nearly finished his shift but would look into it we said we'd wait in the bar a few hours passed no sign of anyone.. My partner went back to the reception and informed another member of staff a lovely young guy he checked the room and he provided an extension lead and he offered to move us to the only other room available which he explained was a room for disabled people. We decided to stay put as we had set up our things and cooled the room with the air con as it was a warm day. We ate at Canteen it's everything everyone says about it superb service, excellent food, attentive staff we'll definitely visit Canteen again amazing food! Go there!",4,2021,07,16
243,Poor- small and basic,"Booked into one of the Marlins superior king rooms which is not at all as advertised. The room was tiny and was definitely not a 'king' bed. We were so shocked after seeing the room I went to confirmed at reception that this was the correct room we booked. 
Bathroom door opens to the sink & there is very little space to move around the room, really only suitable for one person and no additional amenities such as an iron in the room. 

Very disappointed with this hotel, you can stay in a much nicer hotel for the same price in Dublin city. 

Cocktails in the bar were nice hence the one star.",1,2021,07,16
243,Fantastic,"Amazing Hotel, food was delicious, staff were very friendly and efficient. Beds were super comfortable and the hotel was spotless. I would highly recommend the Marlin Hotel. The location is excellent!",5,2021,07,15
243,Great hotel,"The staff was so friendly and helpful! The hotel is in a great location literally only a 5 minute walk to Grafton street if even at that. The hotel room was so clean, the bed was so comfortable like sleeping in your own bed.",5,2021,07,14
243,5 stars,"Comfortable hotel which is very clean, lovely friendly staff that will oblige in any way possible from the welcome to the checking out, excellent central location in city centre and parking just across the road on St stephens Green shopping centre if required.",5,2021,07,13
243,Excellent,"Staff were super welcoming and friendly. The room had a big perfectly comfortable bed, was very clean and had amazing air-conditioning. The location could not be more superb and thus hotel is perfect for a little city getaway! ",5,2021,07,12
243,Staff is everything,"James, Jade and all the staff were great! Location was very convenient. Food was good, a little pricey for my usual budget though…..200 characters is ridiculous though, I’m not a writer after all! Just thought you should know that James and Jade were outstanding ",5,2021,07,12
243,"Perfect location, comfortable stay in a modern hotel!","The experience started from the moment we walked in to the beautiful lobby. The staff were friendly and helpful and assisted our check in. The room was small which was of course expected from the room info on the website. However it was perfectly adequate for our needs and absolutely spotlessly clean. The bed was huge and so comfortable. The breakfast was delicious. The surrounding and decor in the public areas of the hotel are astounding. The location is perfect, a few minutes walk to an abundance of restaurants, bars, and tourist attractions. Would highly recommend.",5,2021,07,11
243,a good night's sleep in Dublin,"We saw the Marlin being built and, when the hotel we'd previously used closed, we were keen to try it. Having done so for one brief night, I can thoroughly recommend its modernity, its pleasing and well-equipped bedrooms (we stayed in the Executive version) and the courtesy of its staff. The only drawback was a very long wait for our evening food to be served. Although this was apparently caused by a printer failurein the kitchen, the waiting staff should have been quicker to spot the problem. Nevertheless, we shall book again when next in the city. Its location is ideal.  ",4,2021,07,08
243,Fantastic ... everything!,"Great rooms, helpful staff, good location, modern amenities. Nice bar and breakfast. The hotel is situated in a fantastic location close to all the action (but not in the middle of it). Very economical as well.",5,2021,07,07
243,"Great Hotel, Great Location","Perfect location, great facilities.  Perfect for shortbreaks or work stay overs.  Bar and outdoor seating areas are great.  Be mindful of alcohol prices  it can suprise you if you dont know to ask.  Highly recommend this hotel",5,2021,07,06
243,Don't waste your money,"There is a reason that the hotel is priced reasonably being in Dublin city center.  Cold water from the shower. Breakfast was awful, not even a poached eggs and for €15 p.p. Loud residents which were not dealth with even after complaints and poor customer service. I will not be returning.",1,2021,07,04
243,Excellent location,"Super location, right beside Stephen’s Green car park. Very compact rooms but ideal for an overnight stay.,If they keep the prices as low as I paid €130/€160 with breakfast, I’ll be back. Breakfast was terrible, a cold fry, is the only thing but it was in Covid times and I’ll give them a pass for that ",4,2021,07,03
243,Loved it - great rooms and excellent food,The rooms were very well finished and the most comfortable bed and pillows I have had in a hotel room in a long time.  The hotel is very close to Grafton Street and St. Stephens Green but still a quiet location.  Lovely meal in the bar and nice atmosphere.,5,2021,07,02
243,Invalid noise complaint,Only bad thing I had to say was we got a noise complaint when no one on our floor was complaining we were approached by knock on the door and another person from another room actually came out and told the person at the door we weren’t making any noise ,4,2021,06,28
243,Perfect City Stay,"We can't wait to go back to the Marlin for another city break. Really clean, friendly staff and such comfortable beds. The food and drink was delicious too. Ideal location for shoos, restaurants and parking. Really couldn't fault it at all. ",5,2021,06,28
243,Great hotel,Staff were very helpful. The hotel is in a fantastic location and it's very quiet there. Dinner was very nice as was the breakfast the following day. Parking is straight across the road and good value,5,2021,06,26
243,Good location,The location was very good and the staff was lovely however the rooms were a bit small. Would prefer if the rooms were bigger. The alarm went off 3 times at 3 am and we did not receive any compensation for it ruining our sleep,5,2021,06,26
243,Excellent stay 😊,Excellent stay at this new hotel. The downstairs areas are really well set out and decor lovely. Had a wonderful breakfast also. The pre dinner drinks in the bar area also chilled on the sofas by the lobby. Staff were lovely and rooms super clean.,5,2021,06,25
243,1 night city break,"What a modern hotel. Self check in. Nice and easy. Amazing ambiance lobby & bar area. 
Rooms spotless and super modern. Staff super friendly.. I would have no problem recommending this hotel to anyone!! Enjoy 😉 ",5,2021,06,24
243,Amazing hotel and in a great location,"We had an amazing two night stay here. Staff couldn’t do enough for us. Rooms are very cosy but that’s what they’re advertised as. Very compact and comfortable. Great location and will definitely be back again.

Highly recommend!",5,2021,06,22
243,Beautiful Hotel,"What can I say, hotel was not what I expected. From the staff on reception who showed us where everything was. From the stunning bedrooms, to the most comfortable bed. Food just to die for. Staff always up for chat. Thank you will be back. ",5,2021,06,14
243,"Nice hotel, great location","I liked this hotel. The location is great, around the corner from St. Stephens Green and Grafton Street.
The hotel feels new and there are some nice features. The price was great considering the location.",4,2021,06,12
243,"Good food, good vibes",Stayed here at Christmas and last week with friends. Staff were so friendly and helpful both front of house and in the restaurant/bar. Very accommodating for a large group of friends. Great value too and very comfy beds. Will definitely be staying again,5,2021,06,12
243,Lovely Staff - Great ground floor,"Staff were all fantastic. The ground floor is stunning, amazing lobby and bar with a very modern but cosy vibe. The rooms were very clean and the shower was wonderful. The rooms however were a bit dissapointing. Very small, even though we paid for the upgraded room from the standard. There was only one pillow each and they were very soft which I found hard to sleep on. The room temperature controls were also not going as cold as we'd like which kept the room a bit too warm. Overall it was a lovely stay but I don't think I'd return for an overnight, maybe just dinner.",3,2021,06,11
243,"Fantastic, an absolute treasure to find","We usually stay somewhere else when in Dublin but will be choosing here going forward. It is right in the center of the city, about 1 minute from Stephens green shopping center, so about 5 mins from O'Connell street. OMG the beds! they are huge, they are comfy they are really hard to want to get up from. The showers were hot and good size, the blackout blinds were really good. We had a cosy room, it wasnt huge but it also never felt too small. Speaking of the rooms, one of the housekeeping ladies (Aggie) is a gem, she was super nice, super helpful and gave us loads of tips and directions. Every hotel could do with an Aggie! (all staff were great but she was outstanding)  The decor was lovely, check in can be done by kiosk or at the desk, there are loads of places to sit and chill (and work too, if you are like us) wifi was great , place was immaculate, food was a good mix between indulgent and wholesome. 
",5,2021,06,11
243,Excellent Staff,"Every member of staff was friendly, helpful and kind. It’s rare to get so many nice staff in a hotel. The hotel is lovely and modern and the beds are very comfortable. The location is super. They breakfast was very big and tasty. I definitely recommend this hotel. I will stay again. ",5,2021,06,04
243,Everyday luxury in the heart of Dublin,"I enjoyed my stay immensely at Marlin hotel Dublin. The overall vibe of the hotel was clean, higher class, but also very approachable and modern. The king-size bed in the room combined with just superb utilities made the stay more than enjoyable. On top of all this, the quality of the staff was something every hotel has to strive towards. Kind, happy, approachable, and extremely helpful. Thank you!",5,2021,05,02
243,Amazing staff & great decor,Our visit was actually last Feb but there wasn’t an option to put that. We loved our room and the bed was absolutely huge! Decor was brilliant. Our stay was great and would recommend. Staff were so kind especially the doormen! Thank you all ❤️,5,2021,02,12
243,Excellent stay,"It was amazing stay and wonderful time. The hotel is conveniently located, close to the city center . Staff were assistant, friendly and extremely professional. The hotel room was clean and spacious. This is definitely my favorite hotel in Dublin! I highly recommend this place. ",5,2021,01,31
243,Average place to stay. Close to everything but the service were lacking,My one week booking was paid for in advance and confirmed but the hotel only registered a reservation for one night and I had to prove I had reserved and paid for a week.  This was sorted out quite quickly - the staff at reception were helpful and efficient.  However in the week I stayed my room was only cleaned once despite complaining.  I only got fresh towels once in the entire week and the TV was not connected to any services.  This was also not repaired despite complaining twice.  I understand that we are in difficult times but really a more regular delivery of towels would have been appreciated.,3,2021,01,16
243,Perfect City Hotel,"Excellent Central location 1 minute from Grafton Street, Stephens Green, Pubs, Restaurants etc

Spotlessly Clean & Modern

Both the Restaurant Food & Guiness arguably best in Dublin (Recommend Pork Tomahawk!!)

Seamless checkin/out etc and very friendly staff",5,2021,01,04
243,Comfortable and clean,"We stayed just before Christmas and I have to say, we enjoyed every moment. The gentleman who greeted us and helped us check in was fantastic and so helpful. We booked an executive room so we were on the sixth floor with a window the size of the wall overlooking the city, the room itself was spotless, modern and comfy. We decided to stay a second night, last minute, (even after we had booked late check out as we still didn’t want to leave just yet) and stayed in one of the cosy king rooms which was lovely, the bed was massive and comfortable. Literally on the doorstep of Grafton street, I would find it difficult to fault this place. A special mention to the people on the reception desk who were both very kind and friendly! ",5,2020,12,30
243,Nothing special,"The hotel was ok. I find it amusing when a walk in shower is listed as a bonus. Do you normally drive in in one's shower? The view of the courtyard on the sixth floor meant we saw nothing but a corridor through a tiny weeny window. My boyfriend booked ""a better"" room. Yes, the bathroom as big, but it's only because the room is equipped for disable guests. The trays from breakfasts outside some rooms were in corridors when we checked in and when we checked out the following day.

The location is good.

The hotel somewhat has no character trying to be modern..it is neither modern or classic.",3,2020,12,29
243,"Brand new, modern and centrally located hotel","This is a beautiful and modern hotel in the perfect location in city centre Dublin - it's pretty much around the corner from Stephen's Green shopping centre. Despite its central location, the inside of the hotel is very quiet, which is ideal for a good night's sleep. Lovely beds and pillows and nice staff. 
I got the sense that perhaps given the current circumstances, the hotel was understaffed, which is not their fault. Our room was not cleaned during our stay (not a big deal to us) and while we were having drinks in the hotel bar, our second round of drinks was forgotten on two different nights. 
We booked an executive-XL king room and I didn't think the name matched the size of the room, as the room was quite small. 
Overall, I would definitely recommend staying here. Great value for what you get, particularly given how new everything is and where it is located. ",4,2020,12,28
243,Great staff,"Great location and staff were fantastic.
Hotel is very new and everything went great.
Total is 2 minutes from St Stephen's Green and there's a car park across the road.
Its normally 33 euro over night but through the Hotel 20 euro",4,2020,12,27
243,STAIN ON BED,"Stayed here December 2020. Lovely modern hotel that, at first glance is beautiful with lovely, accommodating staff. However, the cleanliness of our room was unsatisfactory. There was a questionable stain on the bed and the shower was stained also. The hand towels that were folded on the sink had makeup stains on them too. To add, an unpleasant smell would often blow through the vent. This new hotel has the looks and bones of an amazing hotel, and the staff are absolutely lovely, however, cleaning standards need to be improved. Disappointed considering we paid a lot for a good room.  Standards need to be re-adjusted.",3,2020,12,27
243,Great hotel and location!,"Lovely hotel, a workable gym, very nice restaurant on the ground floor and very friendly staff!!!

I need 200 characters minimum to post my review which is silly, so here I am building up those characters :)",5,2020,12,26
243,Saturday Treat,"By treat, I mean away from the kids!
We just had a night away. The hotel is very well located and this is a big plus. Parking is the multi-storey across the road. Very convenient. €20/day, but that’s central Dublin for ye.
The rooms are small and that’s to be expected too. Very little hanging space or storage. The bed length spans the whole width of the room, but it is large and comfortable.
All in all it does what it says on the tin.",3,2020,12,26
243,Great location but rooms a letdown,"Great location in the centre of the city just off Grafton St. Lobby has clean and modern vibe.
Rooms are very small and claustrophobic as is the bathroom. Particularly hated the bed against the window. There was definitely a draft and also had to climb across my partner to get out of bed..... Hardly ideal",3,2020,12,25
243,Very comfortable hotel,"I really like staying in this hotel but the only thing that bugs me is self check in. It's a drag. I'm there to relax not get stressed by unnecessary technology.
Staff are friendly but maybe not experienced enough but that's no biggy.",4,2020,12,24
243,Funky and cool Hotel,"Central location for shopping
Staff super friendly and service from reception to bar to restaurant was excellent
Ate in Canteen Restaurant and Food was amazing
Stayed overnight and found it great value for money, rooms very comfortable and clean",5,2020,12,22
243,Perfect location for night out without the frills,"Stayed in hotel to meet work friends for a semi-work Christmas dinner. Hotel was lovely but lacked in the areas of bedroom phone being disconnected for entire stay and customer service upon checkin.overall, staff were helpful and nice. location ideal for a inner city dinner or plans. ",4,2020,12,21
243,Stunning and perfectly located.,We stayed here for the weekend and it was absolutely gorgeous. We both enjoyed our stay and how easy it was to check in and out. The staff were incredibly helpful and the hotel is very modern and chic in probably one of the best locations in dublin city. We will definitely be back. ,5,2020,12,21
243,"Location, staff, cleanliness","+++Superb location, staff were amazing and very accommodating, hotel very clean modern and new, soundproof rooms, Bluetooth connectivity, 

- - - tv service not great, and one of the rooms had a very small window with no view, however once we asked the staff they moved us straight away",5,2020,12,20
243,Very expensive overall," Team We stayed in the hotel on Saturday 12th Dec and I hope this feedback is helpful and used constructively. There was a waitress in the bar and grill, she was tall and had blonde wavy hair, I'm sorry not to have got her name. She was excellent, so friendly and helpful, a real star to have on your team when people are out socialising and organising Christmas post covid stresses. Unfortunately after that, we really didn't enjoy our stay. We stayed in room 605. It was meant to be an executive room that we paid €214 for. This room was small by any hotel standards and it looked straight into the balcony of the block of flats next door. We had the curtains pulled the entire time. The bathroom was grubby on the shower tray but we could avoid it and know that grit material can stain so we didnt mention it at the time. We booked a table in the bar and grill. When booking I had asked could we see the Manchester City/ Utd match that was on and was told you didn't know if you would show it but if so I could have a table where the TV was visible. This didn't happen, we were sitting at the window where the bar decor was blocking the TV. Again this was minor, we asked if there was a chance to move but didn't get a reply. The prices on the menu are astronomical, the variety wasn't really bar and grill. €30 for sole! We didnt eat so again didnt raise it, I appreciate this is your perogative. On returning that evening, the clientele were concerning. We asked could we order room service and were told no, the bar was closed only to see this group receive a full order. We asked why and were told because they were demanding. Another guest arrived with a large bag full of alcohol. Very concerning. We simply wouldn't have expected this in a hotel where a room was small yet called Executive and cost €214, where a meal was going to be €50 to €60 a head without a drink in a hotel bar and where the view was described as a city view was onto someone's balcony. Thank you Ashley",1,2020,12,19
243,Hotel stay,"Nice,modern hotel with absolutely fantastic staff. Reception were so approachable and sweet. We eat in the bar and grill, served by great staff full of manner and grace, especially Leandry (unsure if I spelt her name correctly) she was lovely and an absolute gem to the team.",5,2020,12,18
243,Best in town!,"We have stayed in Marlin for a night only, but we’ve enjoyed every bit of it! A small treat before Xmas madness kicks in, amazing dinner followed with the best night sleep in months. Marlin’s bed was so comfortable we didn’t want to leave! Definitely will recommend it for a business trip or a couple visiting Dublin, as the location is in the heart of city centre, with all shops, bars and restaurants on your doorstep. Their breakfast is amazing too, big thank you to the manager Aidan for looking after us so well. We will be back, thank you for great stay.",5,2020,12,18
243,The most unique hotel I’ve been to in Ireland so chic & modern absolutely fabulous hotel great location,"The Marlin hotel is one of the nicest hotels I’ve ever been to.

243,A very poor experience,"This hotel was very cost efficient, but that’s about it. I had a very poor experience, you would not swing a cat in the room. I would have a better shower out of the kitchen sink at home, there was absolutely zero pressure out of the shower and it also never heated up. The menu was very poor with limited selection on it. I was unable to open the only window in the room and the TV kept cutting in and out. By far, the worst hotel I have ever stayed in!",1,2020,12,13
243,Fantastic,"Spending partners birthday weekend here. Fab hotel, love it. From check in we were mad about the place. Ate in bar last night. Lovely menu and very efficient professional staff, especially Patrick who was run off his feet and still smiling. We'll definitely be back",5,2020,12,13
243,"Overnight stay, dinner, drinks and shopping","I had the most fantastic experience staying at the Marlin. Fantastic staff, amazing food at the resturant Canteen. The beds are a dream (really - fab dreams all night) so comfortable. Shopping is just around the corner, parking just accross the road. The whole feel of the hotel is amazing. Stuff to see everywhere. Wonder stay and will be coming back again and again.",5,2020,12,11
243,Drinks,I want to praise and thank Gavin the bar manager as he was so hospitable and made our time in the bar so much more enjoyable. He made the experience so much more comfortable and fun under the circumstances. Good balance of safe and homely!,5,2020,12,10
243,Shopping Trip,Very impressive modern hotel in a very convenient location just off Stephens Green.  Friendly & welcoming staff.  Superb room.  We are also big fans of James Sheridan and Canteen but unfortunately we were not able to try on this visit -  next time.  Excellent bar and outdoor area and barman was very helpful.  I frequently use hotels in the city centre for work and social and this is now a firm favourite.  Looking forward to going back and highly recommend.  Excellent value for money. ,5,2020,12,10

243,excellent experience,"excellent experience, the hotel was clean , although busy it felt safe and the staff were amazing. Excellent location, parking experience was a dream only being across the road. Rooms were very clean larger then expected with excellent acoustics you would never have known you were in the heart of the city. ",5,2020,12,07
243,Very poor,"Miscommunications. Poor service and a dirty bed. Wasnt told i had to amend booking on 3rd party sitte. Then was promised fift plate which never was given. Bed was dirty, customer support was rude and housekeeping came into the room without a mask. Very poor.",1,2020,12,07
243,Great hotel!,"Excellent staff. Busy but nothing was too much trouble. Central location, close to City centre. Room was small but spotlessly clean. Very quiet considering its location. We had meal in the bar which was busy and so service was a little slow, however we were given a complimentary drink as we were waiting.",5,2020,12,07
243,Business Stay,Staff were very friendly especially the gentleman at reception when we arrived & the bar manger. Rooms were clean & comfortable. Location of hotel was great as it was very near Grafton street. No parking however. ,5,2020,11,23
243,Amazing,"Such a nice stay, staff were so kind and offered to help with anything we needed.. rooms are clean with a lovely modern design. Cannot praise the good enough, it was delicious! (Although the portion sizes could be a tad bigger, we ended up going for more food a few hours later)",5,2020,10,28
243,Comfortable and Covid safe,"I stayed in the hotel on my own for a few days before returning to my family home, although the hotel was understandably quite there was still a lovely atmosphere kept up by the welcoming and friendly staff, breakfast was a reduced selection but still very tasty. The beds are one of the comfiest hotel beds I have ever stayed in and they were hard to say goodbye to! Would definitely stay again as the location is great and the quality is amazing.",5,2020,10,26
243,Beautiful Hotel,"Very friendly, professional and helpful staff.  Extremely clean and comfortable bedroom and everywhere else.  Food magnificent, very tasty. Lots of cosy areas to sit.
I would definitely come here again.  ",5,2020,10,25
243,Hidden gem,I stayed here on a 2 night business trip recently. Situated just off the Grafton Street shopping and eating district it's probably the most comfortable and well run hotel in its price range in the city. Loved it.,5,2020,10,25
243,No frills accommodation with an amazing restaurant in house,"We stayed for one night in October the food in the Cantine was great. The service in the bar area was dire. Rooms are average, no frills but modern. The breakfast the next morning was pleasant, we weren’t given any details of when breakfast is served.",3,2020,10,24
243,Amazing,"Gorgous staff, clean room and lovely atmosphere. Could not have enjoyed my stay enough. The food was stunning and also the drinks/cocktails. Very central to town with shops and restaurants surrounding it. ",5,2020,10,23
243,Room not been correctly cleaned,"Blood on my bed sheets and also mud . Asked to change rooms in a near empty hotel and was told ."" No we can change your sheets but you cant change rooms "" . So we left.  Absolutely disgusting in these current climate with covid to not be offered another room",1,2020,10,20
243,Marvelous Marlin,"Wife and I escaped home for a night in town. Funky, modern hotel with lots of little twists. Nice room although a litttle on the small side but super clean and after all, you get what you pay for and upgrades were available. Very friendly and accomodating staff, what with all the restrictions. Lovely meal in the restaurant which had a nice buzz. Breakfast a bit hit and miss but that was down to lack of staff, again due to Covid, lovely when it finally arrived !
The bar has a large outdoor (covered) beer garden which is very popular but needs to be reserved in advance.
Wine list a bit on the pricey side given what is on offer.",4,2020,10,18
243,Few nights stay,"Stayed for a few nights during October and had a really good stay. Breakfast was very filling on the day I had it but lots of options nearby if on a room only rate. Located near to the shopping streets and St Stephens Green. Bus stop for Glendolough is approx 5 mins walk. Room was a good size and clean, so no complaints. We would go back for sure. ",4,2020,10,18
243,Great stay,"Had such a nice stay at this hotel for my boyfriends and I anniversary. Room was so clean and the smart TV was so handy for Netflix and Spotify! Staff were so kind and accommodating, I left an item in my room after I checked out and they were so helpful finding it and keeping it at reception until I was ready to come back and collect it a few days after.

Couldn’t fault our stay, would 100% recommend this hotel and the lovely staff😊",5,2020,10,13
243,Terrific stay; beautiful hotel,Wonderful stay for a few days. Staff were so lovely and accommodating. It felt really relaxing and safe during the pandemic. I’ll be back! The hotel had lovely touches and decor and a very relaxed vibe. ,5,2020,10,04
243,Great location,"Myself and my wife stayed here recently and found it to be excellent overall.
Check in was by means of a tablet in the reception area with a member of staff to assist.
The room was small - which we were expecting - but very clean and the bed was large and comfortable with a very nice duvet. The hotel was quiet at night and the room was pleasantly cool for sleeping.
The large tv allowed you to cast your device to it which was a nice feature.
We didn't eat here so can't comment on the meals but we enjoyed a cocktail in the bar.
The location is excellent.
Staff were pleasant, friendly, professional and efficient throughout.

Overall I'd have no issue in recommending.",5,2020,09,21
243,Great and Safe stay,Great Hotel and the location is ideal with the city at your door. It has great COVID 19 procedures in place. I felt safe that the health procedures were in place. Thanks to the hotel in compiling with my request to have a room with a view. Looking forward to going back.,5,2020,09,19
243,Fantastic stay,Thanks again to the Marlin for a great stay. This was our second time back and again it did not disappoint. Location is just perfect. I want to especially mention Gavin the bar man. On one afternoon  of our stay we were waiting for our room to be cleaned and the way he looked after us was just brilliant. Lovely guy and top notch service. Thanks Gavin!! And the Marlin. ,5,2020,09,16
243,Brilliant hotel,"What can I say. This hotel is amazing. We had to change plans due to covid and the hotel manager looked after us from day one. The staff in the hotel are brilliant and went out of their way for us without any hesitations. 

Was worried about size of the smaller rooms, but was surprised by how big they actually are. The beds were huge and the room was spotless. What more could you ask for.
",5,2020,09,16
243,Wedding stay for us & friends.,"We had the most wonderful & relaxing time at the Marlin. The staff were very helpful and friendly, nothing was a problem. Their facilities & rooms really stood out for me. They staff made everyone's stay easy, an excellent location in the city with top class amenities. We had a fantastic Brunch the day after in the restaurant which was really good, on the even-handed we arrived back after our reception there was food laid on & the bar staff were super in making sure our guests got some drinks too. Would definitely recommend a stay here! All round great stay and value too. ",5,2020,09,15
243,One night weekend stay,"Booked in for one night B&B with dinner in Canteen.
The experience from check in, to dinner, drinks in the bar (which had an area reserved for us on th helpful suggestion of the restaurant who called me to confirm our reservation), right through to breakfast and check out. 
Service was nothing short of exceptional with every interaction with hotel and restaurant warm, welcoming and what certainly felt like sincere friendliness. It was a really stand out and I can't laud them enough. 
Hotel design and layout remind me very much of CitizenM hotels with I have stayed in for business a number of times. 
We'll return before the end of the year. ",5,2020,09,14
243,Lovely for a one night stay,"My boyfriend and I stayed here on 10/9/20 and we absolutely loved the place. The room was beautiful and we really loved it as a getaway for a night. The cocktail menu and 3-4-2 deal are great and the waiter was really nice. One thing we really liked was that the bedroom t.v. had a Chromecast which was cool as we could listen to our own music as we got ready to head out for the night. I didn't catch her name, but the lady on reception that day and the following morning was absolutely lovely. She was really helpful and friendly and an asset to the place. Will definitely come back in the future.",5,2020,09,14
243,What an amazing hotel  5 Star,"Stayed at this hotel  for a  wedding  and was really impressed ,the rooms are a perfect size no space wasted   the design and  layout of the hotel is class and the  food is also amazing ,would 100% recommend this hotel .",5,2020,09,14
243,Hiding Gem in the Heart of Dublin,would like to thank the staff who made our stay so memorable. The hotel was a blend of old and new Dublin that has it's own character. Our vist was to dine in the Canteen Marlin Restaurant which is world class. See you all on our return visit at Christmas. ,5,2020,09,12
243,Birthday holiday,"I’ve stayed in Marlin for 3 nights for my 21st, enjoyed every mi ute of it. Great location but I wanted to take a minute and highlight Melissa on the Front Desk & Sharon serving breakfast. They indeed  made my stay & I’m sure they are appreciated staff in the hotel. Melissa couldn’t be more accommodating & overall she is amazing person!! 
Sharon was so helpful & really hardworking.

Will definitely be back!",5,2020,09,12
243,Excellent - very cool hotel,We spent the night in the Marlin and had a great time. The location is excellent and the hotel itself is very modern and cool. The staff were very welcoming and accomodating! We will definietly be back soon. ,5,2020,09,11
243,Sensational staycation at Marlin Hotel Dublin,"Thoroughly Modern Marlin on the outside yet warm and homely on the inside. Maybe it was the way the staff made us feel, like family, so helpful from the minute we arrived. Felt so safe, everything thought of. All the safety guidelines met but in a way that felt natural and not intrusive. Canteen Marlin was our reason for being there as we came from Celbridge, Co Kildare where Canteen called home for 4 years before moving into Dublin. Incredible Chef James Sheridan and his partner who brings, well let's face it, a bit of Je ne sais que?, international cuisine with Irish ingredients, presented in what can only be explained as magnifique. Taste is superb. Celbridge loss is Marlin Hotel gain. We wish them well and continued success. We may have gone for Canteen Marlin this, our first visit, but we will be returning for Marlin Hotel Dublin, the hospitality of the staff, the room - cosy was it's name and cosy it was, cleaniness check, comfortable bed, and creature comforts covered, the bar & restaurant area where a delicious breakfast is provided, what more could you want, oh and ideal location in Dublin 2, behind St Stephens Green Shopping Centre and just 5 minutes walk from Grafton St, ideal for a shopping weekend or to sample the sights in Dublin. We will be returning soon to this Hotel. Philomena and Daragh",5,2020,09,09
243,Great stay in the heart of Dublin City Centre,"Fantastic, modern hotel right in the heart of Dublin, great location for exploring. We booked a Superior Room and were kindly upgraded to an Executive Room on the top floor of the hotel. The room was modern, comfortable and spacious with a nice little seating area with 2 armchairs. Excellent shower in the room and all the amenities you'd need. We enjoyed a cocktail in the bar before heading out for the evening. Overall, highly recommended, the staff couldn't do enough for us and we felt safe, the hotel are taking all the necessary COVID measures.",5,2020,09,02
243,A false economy :(,"I needed to stay in the city for a business meeting and chose the Marlin ant the last minute. I have stayed in several of the hotels nearly and I thought id try it. The price is attractive but moments after I arrived, I realized that I had made a poor choice.
Let’s just say, you get what you pay for. My room was the smallest hotel room I have ever experienced, facilities are limited and overall, it lacked the basics a business person would need.",1,2020,08,31
243,Excellent hotel,"Great location , Staff are so nice, Very helpful and just chatty in general nice touch. Layout of bar and breakfast area is trendy and you don’t even feel like in a hotel when dining. Bed was so comfortable didn’t want to get up but glad I did as breakfast  was cooked fresh and by far the nicest I have eaten. I can’t wait to visit again.",5,2020,08,31
243,"Gorgeous, Modern, Safe","Really nice hotel, close to St. Stephens Green where there is an array of choice for breakfast, lunch and dinner. Lovely staff, ultra modern bedrooms, my girlfriend had great fun with the blinds, loved the quirkiness and especially liked the terminal check in and out.

We will be back.",5,2020,08,30
243,Canteen at the Marlin is super,"Visited the hotel recently and enjoyed dinner at the canteen restaurant ( I used to be a fan of this restaurant when they started out in Blackrock market all those years ago). 

Food and service were both excellent. Menu (65euro) had both fish and meat options and everything we sampled was good. Highly recommend it - make sure that you book weeks ahead ! 

Ps : Hotel itself is very cool and so close to Grafton st etc.",4,2020,08,30
243,Great Stay,We had a fantastic stay in the Executive room. Lisa and the rest of the staff in reception were incredibly friendly and helpful. The room and hotel were very clean with a lovely atmosphere and the bar was great. Highly recommend.,5,2020,08,29
243,Great hotel in super location,"The Marlin is a fabulous hotel in a great location just off St Stephen's Green shopping centre. The rooms are super clean and the staff are lovely and very helpful. I would happily stay here again, and hope to do so!",5,2020,08,27
243,Great Hotel clean tidy central,"Myself and my girlfriend stayed here last weekend could not fault the facilities and staff breakfast was great and a speedy check in and check out system. I would like to thank James Keville personally for his great service and attention to detail. we will certainly visit again soon.

warm regards Darren C",4,2020,08,24
243,Amazing hotel,"Had such a good stay - the bar was great, such a great cocktail menu. Such lovely staff, Gavin in particular took such good care of us. Recommended specific cocktails we might like and overall was just so friendly and helpful. Would definitely go back.",5,2020,08,24
243,New conveniently located hotel,I stayed at the Marlin for a he first time last Thursday night and I would strongly recommend it. The staff were very friendly and helpful. The room is a little compact but you know that in advance as you are getting great value for money. ,5,2020,08,22
243,Perfect Ambience ,"We had stayed here a week prior and decided to return the following weekend as it was such good value and with location and qualities of rooms made it a no brainer.

But one thing has stood out on both our visits and its the quality of staff. In particular Gavin at the bar, and the Croatian gentleman at the from desk Rusmir. 
They straddle the line between professionalism and friendliness perfectly, they get the job done and read customers to a tee, you can't teach it.. They deserve a raise! ",5,2020,08,21
243,Welcoming hotel,"We stayed in the Marlin for 2 nights while attending a wedding in Dublin. We had a fabulous experience in the modern, quirky hotel. The staff were welcoming and couldn't do enough to help us. The room was comfortable and clean and the shower was excellent.",5,2020,08,18
243,Insufficient cleaning,"When I arrived, my room was not cleaned properly after the previous guest. There were visible stains especially in bathroom, e.g. poo stains in the toilet seat and some brown-red stains (maybe blood) in the sink and table around the sink. When I complained, I was told that due to the coronavirus, the hotel offers reduced cleaning. Yes, that is right, while majority of hotels, restaurants, etc. are proud to offer enhanced cleaning due to covid, this hotel has chosen to offer reduced cleaning. I do not fully understand how reduced cleaning / not cleaning rooms properly between guests would help to mitigate the virus. It seems more like a cost cutting measure. 

On second day of my stay, the room was not cleaned. After complaining and being answered about the reduced cleaning, I even asked if I could get some cleaning equipment to clean the room myself. This was rejected but the front desk promised that my room would be cleaned tomorrow.

On third day, housekeeping made my bed and changed towels, but did not clean the bathroom. Accordingly, the stains from the previous guest were still there. I complained again and was promised to send the housekeeping to redo my room. Later I found out that towels were changed again, but the bathroom was still not cleaned. The front desk called to me later upon my return to my room to ask if everything was ok. I told there are still stains from the previous guest and got a response that it will be taken care tomorrow and that a manager will review my room to ascertain everything is in order.

On fourth day, nothing was done. I complained again and the front desk person came to my room with some cleaning equipment. He spent a while in the bathroom and left telling that the bathroom is now clean. I checked, and he had cleaned the sink, but the previous guest's poo stains in toilet seat were still there. I complained again. The front desk had hard time believing that the stains would be from the previous guest, but reluctantly offered to clean the toilet. So finally, late night at the fourth day of my stay, the room was finally in an acceptable condition. Not hospital clean, but acceptable.

On fifth day, I checked out. I discussed with the manager about the issues with my room. He was not aware of the previous guest’s stains I had been complaining. So, it seems they do not even record the complaints customers make. The manager told the same story about reduced cleaning because of covid. I asked how the cleaning staff would be exposed to covid contamination if they use protective gloves and a face mask. The manager told me that the virus can penetrate through the plastic gloves and thus cleaning is not done properly. You can believe if you want. When asking for compensation, the manager told that they don't do service recoveries due to the coronavirus. Though, handling a customer complaint is not supposed to be affected by the virus in any way. Seems like they just use covid as an excuse for not doing their job.

If you want a room that is cleaned between the guests, choose another hotel.",1,2020,08,17
243,Wonderful Stay,"We had a wonderful stay in this wonderful hotel this weekend. Everything was great from the hotel decor, perfectly clean rooms, central location to the superbly friendly staff, especially Jade in the bar/restaurant.

243,Wonderful staycation ,"Cannot recommend this hotel highly enough. Staff were welcoming & friendly, lots of safety measures in place. Rooms are on the small side, but beautifully decorated & comfortable. 

We enjoyed cocktails in the outside garden, soaking up the wonderful atmosphere. Breakfast was included in our stay, with a wonderful selection. It was absolutely delicious.

The staff are what really makes this hotel, nothing is too much trouble. Looking forward to returning already. ",5,2020,08,16
243,Ok,Staff was so helpful at reception always greeted by them just think the rooms need alot more care as in cleaning and fresh towels if staying two or three days  the bed was two single mattress pushed as one was a bit annoyed and the bin no emptied by the people before just think for covid more awareness that the room has been cleaned as in sticker or something,3,2020,08,10
243,One night stay a Marlin Hotel Dublin,"Absolutely recommend this hotel, the picture of the small room doesn’t do justice, it was near perfect, we booked two rooms and the staff were great no second question same as the bar no issue. Restaurant was booked out but the bar food was more than perfect ",5,2020,08,09
243,Nice Hotel off StStephens Green,"Stayed just one night, self check in is handy, very comfortable bed in nice modern room. Didn’t have breakfast but had a few drinks in the bar, again nice and modern comfortable to sit in. Staff all very friendly and helpful. Parking in multi-storey 2 minutes from hotel.

243,"Great location, staff, and atmosphere; bad room","Amazing location, bougie-hipster atmosphere, very attentive staff. We had a great stay. There were a few issues with the room (milk was 4 months out of date, sink had not been cleaned, sheets were slightly stained, TV was in a weird position), but we didn't bring these to the attention of the staff, who I'm sure would have been quick to help. The room aside, everything was spotless and there are loads of measures in place against COVID-19.",3,2020,08,06
243,"Fabulous warm, welcoming experience","This is the place to stay and eat in Dublin. I recently had the pleasure of staying at this hotel on a trip home from Canada. Everything was perfect, from the welcome you get on arrival and all through your stay to the top notch food in their restaurant, Canteen. 

The service delivered is completely genuine, you can tell that they get great pleasure from knowing their guests are happy.  And the food in Canteen is some of the best I've had. Also noted was the cleanliness which is super important to me. Everything was spotless, they were frequently seen cleaning and disinfecting surfaces and this helped put me at ease.

It was a truly wonderful experience. If you get the opportunity to stay and eat here, you should. Highly recommended.",5,2020,08,05
243,Fab Hotel in a Perfect Location,The Marlin Hotel is in a perfect location right next to bars and shops. The hotel is brand new and spotless throughout. We fell in love with the ENORMOUS BED! The room was small but had everything you would need for short stays. I think if you were staying longer you might want a slightly bigger room. The residents bar was great and the staff were extremely friendly and helpful. We are already planning our next stay at the Marlin Hotel,5,2020,08,04
243,"Beautiful, unique hotel in the heart of Dublin","First time staying with The Marlin Hotel, fell in love with the concept of this unique hotel! From meeting James, Declan, Gavin, Jolana, Jade and Raoul, this hotel is the piece de resistance of luxury, elegance and sophistication in the heart of Dublin’s Shopping District!
The food, the linen, the quality of the room and the decor, is indeed inviting and comforting and helps you relax and unwind after a busy day of either doing business or shopping!
I would really recommend this hotel and congratulations to Declan Sweeney and his team for adding sophistication to Dublin’s hospitality sector!
You really wouldn’t find fault with this hotel or the staff!",5,2020,08,03

Treat yourself to a night here , I guarantee that it won’t disappoint!",5,2020,08,03
243,Bad start,"The hotel charged me twice for my room and said the mistake would be rectified immediately and the extra €250 would be back in my Acc straight away. That extra €250 that I was charged was my spending money for that day/night. 
It’s been 8 days since I’ve stayed there and I still haven’t been refunded .
Thanks for nothing 🙄",2,2020,08,03

243,Ground Floor Facilities,"I popped in here for a quick look as I'd been following the fit out online and was very impressed with all the design features so I wanted to see them in person.

Yolanda spotted that I was interested and offered me a guided tour and explained all of the different features that had been implemented in response to social distancing and Covid-19. It was brilliant to get a tour from someone who worked there and she seemed enthusiastic and very proud of the workplace. It was really brilliant to see and for that reason - I will return for food/drinks soon hopefully.  

Best of luck,

Ronan",5,2020,07,28
243,Overnite stay,"very enjoyable stay with the highlight being the dinner we had in the Canteen Restaurant - which was top class and reasonably priced.

Staff were also excellent, knowledgeable and very pleasant to deal with",5,2020,07,27
243,"""A very stylish, modern hotel in a very central location"".","Stayed in The Marlin Hotel for one night and I'm giving it a four star for the only reason that there could be some minor improvements, otherwise the stay was very pleasant.

The hotel itself is beautiful - it is very modern and the best part of it has to be the rooms (the bed is super comfy and huge!). The air conditioning unit which you have the ability to control is brilliant too, aswell as the large TV! 

With regards to location, the hotel is a stone's throw from the city centre - Grafton Street & St. Stephens Green if you like shopping or eating out! However, what I did find unusal is the placement of the hotel - as it's directly in the middle of a flat block housing area, can't be helped. But you have no views from the bedrooms, if you're keen on scenery.

The food was lovely - very fresh and appetising, however breakfast could have been improved - a contintenal style breakfast should include hot food, of which it didn't on this visit - if it has something to do with the current global issue then that's understandable, it was just not made clear. 

If you are driving, parking is probably the best in the city centre as it's directly across the road and not expensive either so less to walk and carry bags.

Considering the current pandemic, the hotel have adapted very well - with screens, distancing and the spotless rooms. We couldn't fault the staff with that at all, and they were very accommodating and helpful throughout the whole stay.

We would likely stay again, just to give it another chance. ",4,2020,07,26
243,Excellent food,"Went there for dinner and were pleasantly surprised by the quality of the food,very tasty and beautifully presented. The staff were very friendly and helpful and I can certainly say that we will  go back again. 
",5,2020,07,23
243,Perfect,"Loved our stay at the Marlin. We just wanted a couple of days to switch off and unwind and it was the perfect place to do that.
Great facilities, lovely rooms and really brilliant staff. Jolanda took care of us for our stay, from check in to check out. Jolanda was really kind and so helpful, making sure everything was working out for us so we could rest. She is an asset to the hotel.
As for the location, it's perfect. Quiet and a stone's throw from some of the best restaurants, cafés and street foods in Dublin.
Or, there is a lovely restaurant and bar right in the hotel if you just want to relax in the hotel.
Will definitely be back. Thanks guys.",5,2020,07,19
243,Amazing food and friendly staff ,"Had heard great reviews about the Canteen restaurant at the Marlin so decided to give it a try. Was warmly greeted by front of staff on arrival and brought to the restaurant. The decor is beautiful and very fun. The staff in the restaurant were so friendly and accommodating and the food was amazing. We had the four course menu and it was exceptional, the lobster was a highlight. Stayed for some cocktails in the bar after dinner and again the staff were great, especially Aidan who looked after us and remembered us from a previous visit to the bar. Will definitely be back! ",5,2020,07,17
243,Night stay,"It was very good, staff really friendly, bar had an excellent cocktail menu, the location was great. The only downside was that they did not do roomservice...and my friend attempted to pay for a bottle of prosecco to be sent up to us as a surprise, but the hotel refused to take payment over the phone. Two miniscule problems, but both seem unnecessary and could have brought our stay to a 5.",4,2020,07,17
243,Super service,Had a great stay in the marlin hotel service was excellent from the moment we entered till we checked out fresh modern rooms with a large comfortable bed great guinness in the bar followed by a fantastic meal in the canteen restaurant to aidan and all the staff thanks for a great stay we will be back again !,5,2020,07,12
243,Excellent 10/10,"Spotlessly clean, very comfortable, perfect location in the centre of the city, friendly staff, fantastic communal areas. Well stocked bar, fast wifi, perfect for city break or business stays. Thanks a million, I'll definately be back",5,2020,07,11
243,Great overnight stay,"Myself and my 9 year daughter spent a night at the Marlin hotel and we are already planning our next visit! Everything from the welcome we received on arrival to our departure was excellent. Our room was a pod style and was so cool and comfy, absolutely perfect for an overnight stay!! The staff are really friendly and professional, they are implementing all the Covid 19 measures without any fuss or discomfort!! The location is fantastic. I really couldn’t recommend this hotel enough.",5,2020,07,10
243,"Lovely stay, great location","The hotel is in a great location, a two minute walk from Stephens Green. The hotel has a cool/quirky feel to it throughout. The rooms are spacious, clean and it is great value for money. 

We didn’t get to try the restaurant out on this occasion but will in the future. We did go to the bar, it was lovely and had a great cocktail selection. 

Staff were lovely throughout and all very helpful. We will definitely stay again.",5,2020,07,04
243,"Central, modern -  but not as fancy as it appears to be on first sight,","The hotel is best located near St.Patricks Cathedral as well St .Stephens Green and  not far from the famous temple bar. The Lobby is modern and hip decorated,  there is a self-service check-in which is assisted by the friendly porter. This seems to be the future of checking into hotels, eventhough it draws a picture of cold future. 

We stayed at a executive room for three nights. As we entered we wondered that we where staying in a dasabled-ready-room - kudos for the hotel offering rooms like that, eventhough we where a bit confused that we got that room, since the hotel seemed to be nearly empty due to the pandemic. 

The bedspread was sadly dirty (stains) and the shower curtain already turned grey on the bottom. We are good sleepers but the bed was not comfy at all; we even reported this to the porter. We got informed that the more expensive rooms have better beds. We did not book the cheapest room,  but a comfy bed is the most important thing in a hotelroom.",3,2020,05,04
243,Lovely stay!,"Brand new hotel with an amazing design, beautiful, very comfy, in the heart of the city with lovely staff.
Laundry area for guests (i didn't use it) as well as a good gym (used).
Cleanliness wasn’t the best at our stay, a bit dusty inside and took a while to our room to be cleaned, one of the days was necessary to remind them i would like the room to be cleaned. As the hotel was brand new (september/19), im pretty sure its more organised right now.
Definitely would stay here again!
There’s a mall with a supermarket walking distance from the hotel, as well street shops and restaurants around.",4,2020,03,31
243,Booking Refund - What a Joke,"As per the previous comment I also cannot get a refund on my hotel room even though it is not my choice to cancel my holiday.
I have messaged the hotel and I am being asked to rebook for 2021!!!!
Who knows what we will be going on this time next year, I just want my money back for something that is unprecedented and unknown.
Not very fair really.",1,2020,03,26
243,"Very nice hotel, wonderfully appointed and convenient Dublin location","This hotel is newer and very well appointed.  Rooms are spacious, bathrooms are clean, towels and toiletries ample.  Staff is friendly and helpful.  They have a great breakfast buffet and the Dining room and Bar are available should you wish to dine in the hotel.  You can walk to everything - location is fantastic.   Highly recommend for your Dublin stay.",4,2020,03,19

243,Worth a Visit,"We tried this new hotel and were very impressed by the reception, restaurant and bar areas. Room was compact but very comfortable, Staff were very professional and friendly and it is extremely well located behind Stephens Green shopping centre. ",4,2020,03,14

243,Exactly what I was looking for,"We were looking for a comfortable, clean and well-located hotel in Dublin for a recent weekend visit. The Marlin was perfect. The lobby had a fab environment, the staff were so welcoming and friendly. Our room was spotless and the bed was super comfy. It was just around the corner from Stephen's Green and was amazingly well located. Can't wait to stay again! ",5,2020,03,10

243,Great City Centre Location,Excellent hotel.  The hotel is clean and modern with very attentive staff.  Special shout out to the night manager making sure everybody who entered had a key to a room.  Small rooms but with large beds and great black out blinds. ,5,2020,03,09
243,Weekend trip,"Stayed at the Marlin this weekend and really enjoyed it. Super fun and quirky hotel, great location and even better staff who allowed us to check in earlier. The bed was big and soft, great towels, maybe would've liked better toiletries as they were mostly for men and smelled odd. We were also confused as to why there was a media hub as the bluetooth connection never paired. 

however overall really enjoyed our stay and would definitely be back!",4,2020,03,08
243,"Great stay, prime location, stylish design!","Really enjoyed our stay at Marlin. It has it all and much more! Very clean, very  stylish, friendly hotel staff. Lots of comfortable seating areas on the ground floor to work or just socialize w/colleagues & friends.   Photobooth is one of those extras that add fun & make it unforgettable!",5,2020,03,08
243,"Modern, new, clean hotel, with small, poorly-designed rooms","Not for business travelers. No closet, three wire hangers attached to a wall, tiny bathroom that floods when you use the shower, bed unnecessarily large  -occupies 60% of the room area, room window faces opposing hallway, no ambient lighting only bright overhead lights, obnoxious self-checkout kiosks, pricey for what you get.",2,2020,03,07
243,"I enjoyed everything about this place. The entrance for the hotel it’s amazing, the coffee station is lovely.","The most amazing thing is how clean it’s the place, amazing personnel, very friendly, excellent location, is close to main places. The room is lovely, I totally recommend it. I would love to come back soon",5,2020,03,07
243,Great location,The staff in the reception area were extremely friendly and helpful. The bed was big and very comfortable but one of us had to crawl over the other in the dark to go to the loo. Not ideal. The location of the hotel is brilliant and I would use it again should we go back to Dublin. Tea and coffee making facilities in the room would be a welcome addition,4,2020,03,07
243,Monday Night Stay,"Beautiful hotel located opposite St Stephan’s Green carpark . Gorgeous decor and the food/breakfast in the bar were fantastic . Any staff that I came in contact with were friendly, willing to help and lovely to talk to. 
I booked mid-week so availed of the upgrade offer . €135 for the night , not
Including breakfast. I thought this was quite reasonable considering location and how new the place was . 
Will most definitely be staying her again 👌🏼😊
",5,2020,03,07
243,Food and Funky Vibes.,So I had this hotel come up on my social networking sites as a recommendation for a while so I thought one night I'd check out the restaurant for some much needed me time. It didn't disappoint. I'm a big fan of good quality fish and chips so I opted for it on the menu. It was cooked to perfection. The interior was very Hoxton Hotel London meets Chelsea New York. I absolutely loved it especially when you can escape to a different world just feasting on the visual. I'd definitely go again and bring or recommend friends to take a visit. I'm really curious about who the chef is because it's rare to find fish cooked so well without being dry and flavorless outside of the Burdock establishment in my opinion. Cant wait to get the opportunity to go back.,5,2020,03,06
243,Very cool. Great new hotel,"Hotel is really close to Stephens green.  Very modern open plan layout on the ground floor. Staff very friendly and helpful.  Bedroom small but suitable for what I wanted. Really well equipped wort Bluetooth and chrome cast to tv.  Black our blinds. Great value and would recommend 
",5,2020,03,06
243,Best hotel stay I've ever had,"This hotel is beautiful, so different. The rooms are small so go for a larger room if that's what you prefer. Personally I went with a cosy king. The room was very small but had all the essentials. The bed was massive and the most comfortable one I've ever slept in. The staff couldn't be more helpful and it was very very clean. The breakfast is a must have, it was gorgeous. Could not fault this hotel in any way it really was excellent and in a fantastic location. I'll definitely be back, very happy customer.",5,2020,03,06
243,impressive design,"What a hotel! A wonderfully vibrant, fresh and friendly experience. 
From the inspiring architectural detailing, to the hard working & welcoming staff- a magnificent experience. 
To highlight a few outstanding features. 1.Amazing coffee and 2.Truely ridiculously comfortable bed. 
Take a bow Marlin. 
Well done. 
We most definitely will return.

243,Great hotel!! Definitely recommend the Deluxe room,"Amazing hotel in a quiet street close to all main attractions.Loved the room. The hotel is very nicely decorated & has in house bar & restaurant. 
The only thing I didn't enjoy was breakfast, not lots of choice if you are not feeling like having a greasy full English breakfast.Despite of this, I would recommend staying here & would stay again.",5,2020,03,06
243,perfect location,"Really cool hotel in a perfect location ...spotless...staff so friendly from reception to bar..
Good value for bar food also with good range of meals..
Parking in car park at St Stpehens Green Centre. just across the road ",4,2020,03,06
243,"Finally a reasonably priced, modern and central hotel","One of the best Dublin hotels, a well priced central location.  We had a cosy room and I was worried it would be too small but actually the bed was HUGE. Very well laid out, clean, and modern!

The reception staff were incredibly friendly and when I arrived at 11 am and asked to bag drop they said a room was available and were happy to check me in early. 
The buffet breakfast was a good mix and catered well for vegans.",5,2020,03,04
243,Fantastic Experience ,"Really handy city centre location just off St Stephens Green. Fabulous interiors. Staff are so lovely and welcoming and really nice. Room is snug, bed is gorgeous. Food yummy. Definitely coming back and looking forward to it already. ",5,2020,03,04
243,"Brand new, original and efficient","If you like technology and design this place if for you. From a fully automated check-in (assistance available at desk) to some designed spaces (work, relax etc...) this hotel is different from the rest of the existing standard chains. It is some king od cooperative hotels with lots of shared spaces that offer conviviality.",5,2020,03,04
243,Cool hotel in a great location!,"Been to Dublin many times but first time staying at the Marlin. When we arrived we were welcomed by a super friendly male member of staff (didn’t get his name, white, shirt dark hair Dublin accent) who recommended a great local pub to enjoy a pint of Guinness. (Which we did!) The lobby decor is very cool with quirky accessories, a coffee bar, and we had great fun in the photobooth! The Garden room is a lovely room with real fire. Lovely clean room with large comfy bed. We enjoyed a delicious and varied daily breakfast buffet. Only one criticism is they only had one coffee machine and there was always a long queue, however the lovely staff were quick to notice and offered to bring a pot of coffee to the table. The Marlin is in a great location near St Stephens green in walking distance from all the main attractions. Highly recommend this hotel!",5,2020,03,03
243,Excellent choice,"It was a perfect stay - full English breakfast, very comfortable bed, not noisy, lovely interior, friendly staff. Location at the very city center, very close for going sightseeing, shopping or visiting pubs. Also very close to the airport bus stop. ",5,2020,03,03
243,"Great location, enjoyable stay, excellent ","Stayed at the Marlin over the weekend for 3 day. Loved everything about the premises, staff helpful a friendly. 
The location is remarkable as it close to everything.. main tourist attractions,trendy bars,shopping district and more. Its great if you ate one for seeing what the citys night life has to offer, less then a 4 min walk to Dublins busy and aloud night social seen but yet not too close so it so quiet...best of both 
Very modern and trendy but yet keeping a personal vibe from all stsff whis i find some new trendy hotels dont have. 
I stsyed in a cozy double which it there reasonably priced rooms. Its ther smallest room yet is much bigger then there competitors on Harcourt Street, When you consider this it actually gret value so this wasent a problem. Everything is in the room and the bed is very big especially if it only one in it..lol
Food great and price it good too. Very clean all over hotel and will definitely be back very noon. Ill be switching my favourite Harcourt Street Hotel that has a trendy rooftop bar and a very politically famous swing on top floor...no names mentioned:). So this will be my go to place to stay when in the city  again ",5,2020,03,02

243,Fantastic find! We’ll be back! ,"Fantastic hotel!  Simple rooms but all that you need.  Bed only has one side open so one person would need to climb over the other but this wasn’t an issue.  I had the best nights sleep I’ve had in a long time!  No noise and very comfy bed.  Fabulous decor in lobby and bar.  Staff friendly, helpful and attentive.  Great location.  Breakfast was nice.  I was dubious but the ‘compact’ rooms but they were great! Don’t look at any other hotel!

243,Review weekend 28 - 1st March 2020,"I stayed in this hotel in December 2019 and again in February 2020.  Location is perfect, close to everything.  Stephen's Green Shopping Centre & Car Park right on your doorstep.  Self check in but if you need help, there is always someone there to aid you.",5,2020,03,02
243,"Hip, modern Hotel w/great location and excellent staff","We just returned from a weekend getaway in Dublin at the Marlin; we were very pleased with everything about our stay. We had a cozy king room, and it is cozy indeed. The bed and pillows were huge and amazing. The room was small, like most city center hotels, but very thoughtfully designed. Electric blinds and curtains, plenty of USB ports and outlets, and under bed storage for luggage. I especially liked the speakers in the bath, nice touch!
The staff is friendly, professional, and very helpful. 
The Guinness is the best pour we had in Dublin- I don't know what they do with it, but it was brilliant. I attribute it to the crack bar staff they have- all top-notch. 
Location is great- away from the Temple Bar rowdiness, but close enough to walk.",5,2020,03,02
243,Marlin Dublin,"Phenomenal service, location and comfort. Loved staying here. Breakfast amazing, staff so friendly and accommodating and the location is excellent. The most comfortable beds ever. Looking forward to staying there again soon. ",5,2020,03,02

243,Excellent hotel,"Loved this hotel, staff were really friendly and would go out of there way to help you. Bar and reception is lovely, location is great. Rooms were clean, bit small but that wasn't a problem for us. Would 100% go back and recommend to family and friends.",5,2020,03,01
243,Great location in central Dublin at the right price,"Centrally located (2 blocks from Grafton Street and St. Stephen's Green); fun and inviting common areas; great co-working spaces available on ground floor if you're traveling for work. The rooms are small, but the bed was immense and very comfortable. Be forewarned: there were no closets in the room I stayed in –– but there's a huge drawer tucked under the bed and three hangers and three hooks on the wall for hanging clothes. Probably fine for the average short-term visitor. It was for me.",5,2020,03,01
243,"Great experience, Great staff!","Lovely atmosphere in every ambient of the hotel. Great staff, very professional and ready to solve any kind of issue.

We also could enjoy nice drinks at the bar!
Extremely suggested.

243,Amazing stay in the heart of Dublin,"I stayed at Marlin Dublin during a weekend break with my two young daughters. From the minute we checked in until we checked out the service was fantastic. The staff were friendly, warm and personable from housekeeping all the way up to senior management. They interacted with my children, which for me is always a positive and very important. The breakfast was amazing and there was a good variety to choose from. The beds were huge and very comfortable. The room was clean and spacious, ideal for a short stay with ample storage space. The blackout blinds were a welcome addition if you wanted to lay in in the mornings. The shower was sufficient and powerful enough. The in room safe was also great for storing valuables while you were out and about. The hotel was in close proximity to shops on Grafton street and very close the local museums and St Stephens Green. Good transport links with the Luas only a few minutes away too. Overall an amazing break in a wonderful city. Definitely recommend and will return in future.",5,2020,03,01
243,Excellent location,"Loved our stay in this quirky central location. Staff were excellent, friendly, helpful and efficient. The hotel was spotless throughout. Only disappointment was the breakfast, we only ate there one day and are elsewhere on the second day. It wouldn't take much to improve it but it t does to be brought up to the standard of the he rest of the venue. ",4,2020,02,29
243,"a smart, ultra-modern hotel with very helpful staff","This is a very smart, ultra-modern hotel with very helpful staff.
the rooms were very different, with a bed (I presume super-king or bigger)  that stretched right from one wall to the opposite side of the room, so involved one climbing over the other to get in and out. That could add to your hotel fun!
Bar and reception staff were lovely
Breakfast was great.
As with lots of places in Dublin, somewhat expensive drinks (we didn't have dinner there), so 2 single gin and tonics 20euro!",4,2020,02,29
243,Definitely will be staying again!,"Extremely friendly and helpful staff everywhere around the hotel. Nothing too much trouble. Rooms are great, breakfast is incredible and the staff go above and beyond to make you happy. You can tell it’s a new hotel and still bedding in but will soon be exceptional when all working in harmony. No issues, no complaints, loved our stay and will definitely stay again. Brilliant location too.",5,2020,02,28
243,Birthday stay,"Stayed here for one night before my birthday as a treat and all I can say is wow.
Everything from making the booking with the lovely reservations team who were so helpful and friendly to the check out was flawless.
Upon check in with amazing front desk team they were ever so helpful and nice offering suggestions of things to do and see around the city.
The room was better then expected, I had a cosy king which I though from the picture would be too small but as the name suggested it was very cosy indeed, the rain shower was one of my favourite features of the room but the mattress is a close second.
Breakfast was effortless with the full Irish buffet and the helpful staff offer help and assistance if needed but leave you to enjoy and relax in the beautiful surroundings.
My only complain is that my stay was not long enough, I have only booked the one night stay.
Will definitely be coming back to the Marlin Hotel Dublin in the future.",5,2020,02,28
243,Beautiful hotel.,"Hotel was beautiful and in a great location, very close to Grafton St. Staff were all very cheerful and friendly, and very helpful. My only criticism was that breakfast wasnt very hot. Not a massive issue really. ",4,2020,02,28
243,Very good stay,"We stayed 2 night at the marlin hotel dublin.
The location is really central and very handy for Dublins shopping and nightlife areas.
One point would be the area around the hotel is slightly dodgy but the same could be said of nearly everywhere in Dublin. Just be careful and stay on the main routes. 
The room is small but was fine for 2 nights. The bed was very big and very comfortable. The bathroom was fine, the shower pressure could have been better but a small complaint. 
The hotel itself is very sleek, lobby is really nice and the bar looks nice. 
The staff were friendly and helpful and the automated check out service worked well. 
My only complaint would be that on trying to use the chrome cast facility on the tv  ( a service that was apparently available) I inadvertently signed up for a premium text message service. 
This happened when I scanned the qr code shown on screen while going through the setup of my phone to the chromecast.
 In my opinion the set up shouldnt have had this in the middle of it as I thought this was part of the process and I selected yes to something I shouldnt. This will cost me money in stopping the service and in receiving texts from them.
Also I never did actually manage to enable the chrome cast facility. ",4,2020,02,28
243,The Place to stay in Dublin!,"It is funny, even the taxi drivers kept asking us how our stay was at the Marlin Hotel; we say always the same thing: ""Absolut fantastic! You should try it yourself...."". In sum, not only the location is great, the whole hotel team as well: friendly, efficient, professional and absolute customer oriented.",5,2020,02,28
243,Good Central Hotel,"This was our first time staying at The Marlin Hotel. What we liked most about The Marlin Hotel was the location. The reception staff were all very friendly and helpful. On the downside the rooms are quite small and we would have preferred it if the window in the room actually opened for some fresh air. The beds are very comfortable and very big too. The lady on breakfast duty could have been a bit more informative also. She asked us for our room number and told us that we could sit anywhere but we had to ask her if it was buffet style etc. We let the hotel know that it was our 15th wedding anniversary, twice before our visit but we didn't get as much as a congratulations when we got there...",4,2020,02,26
243,Amazing !!! ,We stayed here for a concert in Dublin on the 31st of January ... our only regret was we didn’t have a longer stay ! This hotel is SUPERB !! Big shout out to the famous Andy again for all the help at check in and check out ! The hotel is so modern and the beds are just the nicest beds in the world !! Location is also absolutely perfect ! 😊 can not wait to come back again and this time for a longer stay ! ,5,2020,02,25
243,Weekend stay in February,"Stayed here sat / sun night, and would highly recommend. The hotel is very modern, yet quiirky and has character. Spotlessly clean, our room was a decent size (standard room), had a huge (and very comfortable) bed, and considering the central location, there was no noise to be heard at all. All staff were happy, chatty & welcoming - adding to a good vibe for the hotel.

In addition, the hotel manager (Michelle) was kind enough to give us an early check-in, as we arrived early in the morning and she had confirmed our request via email beforehand. This ensured we did'nt hang around for hours as we thought we might have had to.

For the price, the location & facilities overall, I would definitely stay here again. Only a 10 min walk to Temple Bar area, plus the 'Hairy Lemon' bar is literally just around the corner -  cracking Irish watering hole, well worth checking out.",5,2020,02,25

We had a couple of meals in the bar and the food was tasty, presented well and the service was excellent. It was quite pricy though but a pleasant bar area. The downside for us was the room. We were in a cosy King on the 1st floor. The room was super clean with minimal contemporary furniture. The lighting was bright overhead spotlights or full on main lights. No softer lighting and no bedside lamps. No wardrobes, just 3 coat hooks with 3 hangers for your clothes. There was a safe in the room and a hairdryer and complementary bottled water each day which was nice. The window directly faced an office block which was so close, you could clearly see everything going on and vice versa. This meant we had to have the blind down but unfortunately this made the small room even more claustrophobic. The king size bed covered the entire width of the room and was directly under the window so the person nearest the window had to climb over the other person in order to get in or out. And for us, the mattress was too firm so we really struggled to sleep, lots of back ache and tossing and turning. Unfortunately due to the lack of comfort in the room, we probably wouldn’t stay next time. ",4,2020,02,24
243,Incredible,"Excellent. Great boutique hotel, great facilities, great breakfast and cleaniness. Friendly staff. In the middle of everything and at the same time tucked away from confusion. Common areas excellent. We will surely comeback! Thank you Marlin!",5,2020,02,24
243,Very pleasant stay,"Great location, friendly staff and compact but comfortable room. Hotel reception and common areas very spacious, bar good atmosphere and drinks selection. Breakfast hit the spot, good selection and for a buffet was hot and tasty. ",5,2020,02,24
243,Romantic trip.,"Everything was great except the hard mattress that we could actually feel the springs in, also that there was only one coffee machine in the breakfast area so we sometimes had to stand in line for 15 minutes to get 2 cups of coffee. Everything else was superb, and the staff was really friendly and nice.",4,2020,02,24
243,Could not fault this Hotel,"We stayed at the Marlin hotel for just one night and quite simply we could not fault our experience.  The location of the hotel is ideal and all the staff so very welcoming and courteous.

We ate in the hotel which was an excellent meal and not expensive - and then spent a couple of hours in the hotel bar. 

Everything, absolutely everything is state of the art........and the bed was without doubt the most comfortable bed i have ever slept on.

Whilst the hotel is certainly not the cheapest hotel we could have picked......I am delighted that we chose to stay at the Marlin as it was worth every penny paid.",5,2020,02,23
243,Trendy and unique hotel,"This new hotel is not only lovley inside with very interesting areas and decorative spaces, it has such friendly staff and amazing breakfast. The cosy room had a minimalist feel with a huge comfortable bed and tv. It was modern with nice lighting. If you plan on spending alot of time in your room then opt for a bigger suit BUT in a vibrant city why would you be in your room? This space has everything you need for a weekend stay. Location was great! Would recommend the food at the Bow lane grill around the corner. Right near Grafton street with shops and bars. 15 mins walk to the party area of Temple bar. We would definitely recomend to friends. Thank you to the Marlin for a great first stay in Dublin 😁☘",5,2020,02,23
243,Emr,Lovely hotel. Convenient for all city centre events.  Only issue was the bar was closed at 12.30 am so no night cap. Have stayed here several times for theatre nights . Staff are excellent and bar food is nice.,4,2020,02,22
243,"Good location, great working area, mind-numbing disco music ","The Marlin Hotel is a modern, bright and tastefully decorated hotel in Central Dublin, nicely located close to Stephens Green shopping Centre, restaurants, cafe’s and some nice little pubs with live entertainment.

The lobby area is brilliant.  A coffee bar and lots of space and power for a morning of email catch-up.  

Friendly, helpful staff, nice bar.

Rooms are a little on the small side.  The hotel is OK price-wise (Dublin is an expensive city generally).

The only downside is the music playing in the lobby and bar.  It is (seemingly without exception) ‘70’s and ‘80’s dance/disco music.  Really quite bizarre.  I don’t know who selects the music but it really is terrible.  My wife and I joked that the electricity and facilities are great but the hotel uses the music to be sure that guests don’t stay too long...

Bring headphones if you stay at the hotel.  The music WILL drive you crazy.  It’s a shame.  Everything else is good.

243,A perfectly located and good value hotel,"Clean rooms, comfortable spacious beds, professional and friendly staff nothing too much trouble, perfect location to the centre of Dublin great restaurants and shops can highly recommend could do with tea and coffee in the room",5,2020,02,20
243,Great Location in City centre.,Just a stones throw from Grafton Street for hi end shopping! Modern hotel with quirky design and furnishings.  Great use of space. Public lounge areas are great to relax in. Friendly staff are always available to help. Will be back in April next. Great value.,5,2020,02,19
243,Stayed here for going to see River Dance.,"Firstly what a beautiful hotel. Decor is spot on!!!

Huge friendly welcome from the Irish boy as we arrived at the door offered to help us check in at the computers.

Rooms lovely we upgraded for a bigger suite it was very clean.

We ate at the hotel restaurant on the first night of our stay the service was rather slow ..staff pleasant enough though ..They didn’t have the rum that I would have liked then didn’t have the steak that I would have liked either ... but anyway the food we received was amazing.

Only thing that was rather disappointing was I phoned town for a bottle opener and the girl had no clue what I was meaning with the language barrier she did say she would call me back when she asked her colleagues what I was asking for but I never received a call back or the bottle opener ...lol

The security man of the hotel was so friendly!!

We would stay here again just a things stated that were annoying for us.

243,Marlin hotel  Stephens Green,Stayed at the Marlin hotel last weekend  with friends. Excellent  location with shops bars and restaurants all nearby. The staff are extremely friendly and helpful and the breakfast is great and beds were really comfortable.,4,2020,02,18
243,Good Stay Central Location,"I had a short business stay here. It is a pretty new hotel, nice decor, comfortable and well located. The only downsides I would say are that the standard rooms are quite small (fine for a short stay for one) but not great for a longer stay for two especially if you have a lot of luggage. You are encouraged to check in yourself which you may or may not enjoy. Like many hotels now you need to pre-authorise or put credit on your card if you wish to charge coffees or drinks which is a bit of a nuisance. ",4,2020,02,18
243,Lovely hotel,"Lovely hotel in the center of Dublin. Great location, room was nice, big enough, bed very comfy, shower was great. The only downside to the room was that it had no fridge/mini bar, which isn't great when you are travelling for business. The bar and restaurant are really nice, although service was a little slow. ",4,2020,02,17
243,Weekend with the girls,"We had a lovely Twin Room.    Comfortable beds, great night sleep no noise.    Very helpful and welcoming staff, cared for our every need even down to drying wet clothes.  Visitors laundry service in the basement.   Breakfast very good.   Location excellent.",5,2020,02,17
243,Dublin City gem,Perfect little hip gem steps from St Stephen’s Green where old and new Dublin meet. Comfy rooms with views of adjoining buildings but perfect for business travellers. Really lovely atmosphere created by fabulous staff. ,5,2020,02,17
243,Compact room for solo travellers,"Lovely hotel, very modern, good bed linen. Not sure about just having 2 hangers for clothes, its winter and extra hanger would be welcome. Stayed 2 nights in a very compact room, bed reaches wall to wall and against the window. I was only there on business, so spent little time on the room. Not tea/coffee facilities available in my room.",4,2020,02,17
243,Loved it!,"We stayed here for two nights over the weekend. Absolutely loved our stay here. Right from check in to check out every single member of staff was so helpful and friendly, especially the bar staff who were absolutely so much fun!our room was very small but we knew this before booking, but for how much time you actually spend in the room, what does it matter? 

The bed was the most comfiest bed I have ever slept on in a hotel room, the shower was great, the air con/heat was perfect. The only niggle we had was there wasn’t much space to hang any more than two items up so if you were coming for more than a couple of nights I would suggest a bigger room, but for us it was spot on.

We never ate there but did buy coffees from the coffee cart every morning which were beaut! The room was absolutely spotless, it still looks lovely and new. The location was fantastic for all the sights of Dublin. Thanks for a fab stay, if we ever return to Dublin We will be straight back to this hotel without a doubt :)",5,2020,02,16
243,Great location. Love the decor. Great Staff,I have stayed in the Marlin Hotel approx 10 times over the past 6 months and I have always had a great experience. The Hotel is in Dublin 2 in the heart of the shopping and social center of Dublin. It has a very modern and quirky decor which I love. Great staff especially Michelle and Andy.,5,2020,02,13
243,Excellent New hotel ,"Really great welcome and easy checkin service. Funky hotel with excellent design. We had a cosy super king and they are cosy! however extremely comfortable and clean along with all you need. 
If you are staying for a week probably to cosy so get a bigger room, however for a weekend trip it was excellent. Location is excellent!
Breakfast seemed normal however I would suggest the hotel starts a section for coeliacs as I only could have toast. Suggestion some cereals own toasting area and muffins. Thanks 
Loads areas to sit chat or equally work highly recommend for business traveller also. 
Nice bar and coffee truck in reception.
Well done to the interior designer 👌",4,2020,02,13
243,Nice and new hotel,"Stayed here for 5 nights for a business trip. The hotel itself is very cozy and new, and the public areas are very nice. The room is small but it was fine for me because i only slept there. I had a window to the lobby which is pretty strange. The breakfast was simple and good. The location is ok. It's 10-12 minutes walk to the Temple Bar area which can be little bit long if it's cold or rainy, but it is a short walk to Grafton street and area with few pubs. ",4,2020,02,13
243,"Quirky modern hotel, great location",Overall a great 3-night stay for our party of 5 in 3 rooms. We were allowed access to our rooms as soon as we arrived at about 9.30am. Check-in staff were friendly and helpful. Rooms were spotless and well equipped. Public areas were clean and relaxing. The decor is quirky and interesting. We had breakfast on one day which was fantastic with a huge choice of different foods all cooked freshly. The only issue was there was only one bean to cup coffee machine working so there was a queue. Had dinner on another occassion which was also very good (steaks and burgers). Overall the only problem was the weather was very bad and the noise from the rain gutters in our room on the first floor was extremely loud and kept us awake. Suggest management spend a night in one of the first floor rooms when it is raining to experience the noise. I would definitely stay again when next in Dublin but would ask for a room on a different floor. Checkout was also smooth with bag storage provided until our evening flight.,4,2020,02,12
243,Excellent,"Super Staff, great service, very nice rooms and a really funky set up.  Location is as central as it gets.  Love this place!  Will definitely stay again when I am next in Dublin.  Highly recommend staying here for business or pleasure.",5,2020,02,12
243,Convenient New City Hotel ,"I recently spent a week at The Marlin while working in Dublin.  This is a new hotel with a funky, vibrant feel.  I had one of the larger rooms, which is really a typical size hotel room.  The room was clean, the desk was great, internet was fast and free, the bed was comfortable, the shower was clean with lots of hot water and there was a coffee maker in the room.  Breakfast was great and was included in the very affordable room rate. I plan to stay there on my next trip to Dublin.",4,2020,02,12
243,Nice weekend accommodation,Rooms small as we expected but comfortable and good nights sleep. Coffee queues in lobby a bit slow but staff were all lovely. Concierge attentive and great character. Would most definitely stay again. More expensive than normal rates as stayed during the Six Nations tournament. ,5,2020,02,11
243,Fantastic City Break Location,"What a top spot! Right in the city centre - no more than 5 minutes walk from Temple Bar area and a stones throw away from St Stephens Green and Grafton Street. We were welcomed as soon as we arrived. The concierge helped us with the DIY Checking in process. Our room was ideal - electric blinds and curtains. I would have wanted to have access to tea/coffee - but it was not a deal breaker. Excellent breakfast the following day. How about potato cakes and white pudding too for breakfast - make it really Irish. The staff could not have been more helpful. They stored our bags before we finally left. All in all, a perfect hotel in a perfect location.",5,2020,02,11
243,Excellent stay,"Staff were so helpful and welcoming from the moment we arrived. Excellent location, hotel was really cool and great value. Will definately be staying again.

243,Best hotel ever!,"The staff were very friendly and welcoming, we were advised about were to go around Dublin to get the most out of our trip which was really helpful! The location of the hotel is fabulous, you can literally walk to all the attractions, bars, pubs and restaurants! The room itself was lovely with a huge comfy bed and was clean. The actual hotel was quirky and had good food and drinks. Overall an amazing stay, would definitely recommend and will certainly be returning:) ",5,2020,02,10

243,Good spot,"Nice hotel. Self service check in and out - very modern. Decent bar, nice staff, clean rooms. Bed was comfy but the only thing was that it was against the wall - think they all might be like that.

Check in/check out was easy. 
Photobooth is good fun!",5,2020,02,05
243,Cosy King Room,"Really lovely stay in the Marlin hotel this past weekend. Booked a “cosy king” as we would only be using the room to sleep in, however we were pleasantly surprised with the size of the room. Bed was absolutely huge and super comfortable. 
The hotel itself is very tastefully decorated and the room really makes use of the space available.
It was great to actually have working air conditioning in the room(something hard to come by in Ireland in general, not only in Dublin!). The staff were very friendly and helpful. 
One issue was there didn’t appear to be an extractor fan in the bathroom so it got very steamy when using, also the screen for the shower wasn’t big enough to stop water escaping-minor issues but really the positives far outweighed the small “negative”. 
Would definitely stay again and would recommend to friends!",5,2020,02,04
243,Excellent,"The hotel is very clean and the staff are very friendly. The location is great, close to train, bus stop, restaurants and shops. I only stay there for a 5 days but it was very relaxing and the breakfasts are really good.",5,2020,02,03

243,Superb,Superb hotel and location. Staff very friendly and helpful . We were a group of 8 and alll worked out well even with such a large group. Not sure why reviews have to be minimum 20 characters it is like you are giving  me homework ,5,2020,02,03

243,Overall pretty great,"My husband and I spent a weekend here, and we had a lovely stay. The beds in the room were super comfortable, everything functioned well in the room, and the front desk were extremely friendly and helpful. The bar staff did not smile and were honestly pretty rude, and there was a security type of guy in the lobby who seemed to be suspicious of us each time we came in the hotel and watched us closely even though we had room keys and were respectful. Just a weird interaction. Overall, wonderful place to stay in a prime location in the city! ",4,2020,02,02
243,Delightfully modern and comfortable,If you need to be in the centre of town with everything within walking distance then look no further. A bright clean modern hotel with enthusiastic capable staff Breakfast included in our package was very worthwhile ,4,2020,01,28

243,Nicest staff!,"Arrived on Thursday, had a lovely and fast check in. The hotel itself is pretty, chilled and quiet. Perfect for what we where there for. Can’t express how amazing the staff are, best customer service I think I’ve ever received in a hotel, from the staff at reception, to the amazing and chatty bar staff (who even went out of there way to make me a cocktail which wasn’t on the menu) to Randal the security man. 

The bed was massive and the tv has Netflix and YouTube if your just wanting to chill, the room itself wasn’t huge but big enough for what we needed. Extremely clean and modern. All and all I will defiantly be staying here again in the future.",5,2020,01,27
243,Really Enjoyable Stay,"Clean, comfortable and relaxing, really liked the decor and the style of the hotel lobby and bar/restaurant. Bedroom was very cosy and modern, the bed was very comfortable and clean. Really enjoyed my stay and would return to this hotel.",5,2020,01,27

243,A great find with the most pleasant and helpful staff,We booked for our anniversary and could not fault anything. From the moment we arrived we were greeted by super friendly staff. The room was compact but the bed was a dream! So comfortable. Great location together about the city but certainly the staff made our visit even more memorable. Would definitely recommend. Great urban vibe and  decor,5,2020,01,26
243,Superb Location,"I loved the location of this hotel Stayed here for one night while meeting up with friends over Christmas. The atmosphere was excellent and the service in the bar was also very good. They mad an excellent espresso martini. The hotel is brand new, spotless and I loved the decor, really modern.

I will most definitely be returning. Thanks",5,2020,01,25
243,Disappointed by the lack of care after our stay,"Brilliant that the office manager can reply to everyone’s reviews on here but cannot reply to several emails and calls about a matter after we had left the hotel.

Very keen to look after new customers but don’t look after the actual customers who paid to stay with you.

The hotel is nice but really unhelpful if something goes wrong during your stay!",1,2020,01,25
243,Stolen sunglasses,"I am reluctantly leaving a 1 star review after a week of unanswered emails and unreturned phone calls. After all, customer service should extend beyond check out.

I fully anticipate that the hotel manager will reply for all to see on Trip Advisor but I would have been much happier with a response to an email or phone call this week.

I’m sure they will also reply to say that they can’t be held responsible for guest property that is not left in the safe but I feel that this is not an adequate response in this case after giving them every chance to retrieve the item.

I’ll bullet point the details and you can make your own mind up.

- Shortly after check out, I realise I have left my expensive sunglasses in the room and phone the hotel.
- I describe exactly where they will find the glasses.
- I am told that they can’t go and find the glasses immediately but need to wait until the following morning when housekeeping will advise of any lost property.
- I am advised that they have found the glasses case but there are no glasses inside the case (bearing in mind I didn’t wear the sunglasses for the whole trip, let alone get them out of the case)
- How have they found the glasses case but not the glasses inside???
- I am asked whether I would like the empty glasses case posting to me.
- Despite this kind gesture, I asked whether they’d look into this for me as the designer prescription sunglasses were very expensive and useless for anybody without the same prescription as me. I was sure they would have had a record of who had access to the room and sunglasses after my departure.

Since this request I have had complete radio silence from the hotel. No email. No phone call. No sunglasses.

So be careful if you stay here. Use the safe if you do. And certainly don’t leave anything in the room when you leave!",1,2020,01,25
243,Modern hotel in a central location,The Marlin Hotel is in a fantastic location. A perfect base for exploring the city. The rooms are spotless with comfortable beds. The staff were courteous and helpful. There are no tea or coffee making facilities in the bedroom. That's my only criticism. I would gladly stay here again.,5,2020,01,25
243,Excellent and luxe property for an affordable price,"Having stayed in a few neighbouring accommodations in the past, those were booked up and I came across Marlin Hotel with a feasible last-minute price.  I was a solo traveler staying for 2 nights for pleasure.  Despite my late arrival (around midnight) I was welcomed by warm and professional staff.  The 24 hour service is very welcome and its location near St. Stephen's Green was ideal for the bus direct from the airport.  The aesthetics even in the lobby was very beautiful and clean.  The room was even better.  The bed was large and comfy, the shower had great pressure and temperature control, and the room was clean and homey.  I utilized the gym which was sufficient for a regular gym-goer.  
The staff were stellar, everyone made me feel welcome with their hellos and advice about the city.  I have to give special shoutout to Andy who welcomed everyone as if they're a friend.  He noticed my trainers and we had a great chat about great areas to run in the city.",5,2020,01,21
243,"Friendly, Clean & Perfect Location!","I stayed at the Marlin hotel for a birthday treat, the whole experience was great. We were greeted by a lovely friendly irish chap as soon as we got to the hotel who gave us lots of tips for our short stay. When we opened our room door we were presented with a bright, clean and brilliant bedroom, the bed was so comfy we even sacrificed an evening in Temple bar!!",5,2020,01,21
243,New hotel in Dublin,very good hotel--rooms are small but very clean --staff very friendly and helpful both at front of house and in the bar and restaurant. Very central easy walk down Grafton Street and the various entertainment venues ,5,2020,01,20
243,"Brilliant & Modern Space For A Great Price. Don’t think twice, book it. ","Can’t say enough about my stay at The Marlin Hotel. They’ve clearly worked hard to make this place really comfortable and welcoming. A really great modern feel, and excellent lobby design and awesome bar. (Shadily the best pint of Guinness I had in the entire city - no joke.)

The staff is top notch. Honestly I’ve never experienced hotel staff like this, kind, friendly and they remember your name. 

Rooms are cozy while not extravagant, but exactly what you need in a city where you should be spending as little time in your room as possible. Every amenity you could need is promptly delivered. 

Location is prime. Close enough to all the action to be right where you want to be, while also being on a secluded street if you’re looking for some quiet and privacy. 

You’ll be pleased with your choice. Don’t think twice, book it.

243,"Good value, great location","This is a really nice, new hotel in the centre of Dublin. It's good value for bed and breakfast. 
We were a little thrown by the self-service kiosks for check-in - I hope this is not the future and hotel receptionists become redundant. However, there was a desk too, and there was a very helpful staff member on hand to guide us. In fact, all the staff we met were very friendly and helpful.
Our room was small and wouldn't be good if you arrived with a ton of luggage and many outfits to hang up but it's perfect for a short stay. All the essentials are there so it makes sense to skimp on space and make it more affordable. 
The breakfast was very good with a wide choice at the buffet. It's a hip kind of place with interesting décor. The bar was nice and we left thinking that we would definitely stay again if we needed a night in Dublin.",4,2020,01,16

243,Great Place & Staff,first thing we noticed was how friendly all the staff are from the door men to waiting & bar staff. the room was bright clean and very comfortable. breakfast was beautifull and plentyfull. our only gripe is the parking you have to use a public carpark across the road and it was €37 for the night and the hotel pay €18 f that .......,4,2020,01,13

The bed was huge and the most comfortable hotel bed iv slept on. Brilliant to have the smart TV with chrome cast, myself and my daughter were able to watch a film from Netflix. Shower and bathroom are fab. Rooms were quiet. Although we didn't have breakfast we did have dinner which was very tasty and reasonable. Location is perfect for shopping and the City centre. Can't wait to come back again would highly recommend.",5,2020,01,12
243,Trip to Dublin for a family wedding,Rooms were spotless clean and very quiet. Air conditioning was easily controlled. Bathroom was shining. The lobby has a modern youthful atmosphere with plenty of staff available. The breakfast was perfect.,5,2020,01,12
243,Enjoyed my stay; great location!!,Easy checking in and out with helpful and pleasant staff. My room was comfortable and met all my needs with a modern design. Great location for me to get around Dublin and sightsee. Also had dinner in the restaurant (pasta) that was good. I would definitely stay here again and recommend it to family and friends. ,5,2020,01,11
243,Accommodated to my alcohol habits,"The service here was impeccable, from the check in crew to the bar service. The manager, Aiden McGuire was fantastic he took great care of us and even hung around to keep the bar open late for us. 
The hotel was fantastic the rooms were great as are first room we went in to was great but the tv didn’t work. That wasn’t a problem for us went to the front desk and they gave us a new room right away. I definitely recommend this place. 
Thank you Mr. Aiden for everything that you did for us. From greeting  us by first name, to keeping the bar open late to pouring those perfect pints. 

Thanks AJ",5,2020,01,10
243,"Cool place, ideal location. ","This hotel served up all our needs just as we hoped. Location perfect, staff friendly, great price, comfy rooms. Theres a really cool vibe to the place and our room was oh so quiet which is always a must.My only fault was being denied a kettle when I asked for one, apparently our room doesn't get one when I asked, I mean come on.... a kettle. Still, I would stay again.",4,2020,01,09
243,Great place,I  enjoyed my stay here. Staff were super friendly. Building I had to search for room though so don't get drunk if you get get one of the rooms that require twists and turns to find. I've stayed in a lot of hotels around Ireland and this is one of the good ones.,4,2020,01,09
243,A beautiful cool place to stay,"The newest hotel I'd ever set foot in, tastefully designed, comfortable and very quiet rooms (for a city centre location), great bar, friendly staff. And walking distance to everywhere - not one taxi all weekend. We'll be back!",5,2020,01,09
243,Lovely quirky hotel,"Room bit small, breakfast was good just a small issue there was no butter, teabags or milk at breakfast. Watch out for Drinks menu pricing was different to what we were charged. Overall lovely hotel would definitely go back",4,2020,01,08
243,I love  this Hotel,Stayed for an overnight the week before Christmas. I have stayed here once before and had to come back. I absolutely love the cosy room. The Bed is amazing. The best bed in a Hotel I have ever slept in. A smart TV. Spotless clean room. Great  electric blinds . Extremely functional space. The Buffet Breakfast is amazing. Real honeycomb and a proper coffee machine offering lattes and cappuccinos as well as fabulous surroundings. There is nothing to dislike about this Hotel. The front staff are amazing. Location is the best.  I will be back!!! ,5,2020,01,07
243,Amazing trendy hotel in heart of dublin,"Amazing trendy hotel in heart of dublin with super cool dining areas, set up really well for work with loads of work stations and even free separate meeting rooms in the lobby. The bed was ridiculously comfy, the whole place was super clean. Nice atmosphere in the lounge areas and right in the city centre so very easy to walk right to the action.",5,2020,01,07

The staff throughout the hotel could not have been any nicer, in fact some of the friendliest staff we have met ever.",5,2020,01,06
243,"Central Dublin Hotel, clean and compact","We were a couple, heading to Dublin overnight and not willing to pay extortionate prices for the privilege!  This is a compact, clean and comfortable hotel that suited our needs.  There are no trimmings in the rooms but we didn't need them.  The rooms are small and have enough for an overnight or two but not for longer as there was no wardrobe in our room.  Staff were very friendly.  Computerised check in, which was great.  Lovely bar and while we didn't eat in the restaurant, it looked good too.  To walk out the front door and find yourself at the Stephen's Green Shopping Center was brilliant.",4,2020,01,06
243,Couples mini break,"Just enjoyed a one night post Xmas escape from the madness that is Xmas !!! It was lovely- location was excellent, safe car park just across the road... staff couldn’t have been better- friendly, helpful- chatty ( don’t underestimate this - have been served many a time by someone who looked liked they’d rather be anywhere else)... only issue was the room - it was very tight on space just for getting around it...and this wasn’t the smaller room.... but did have everything we needed and everything was of a high standard.... breakfast next morning was excellent  will definitely be back...",5,2020,01,03
243,Excellent hotel,"The hotel is functional, clean, with a very modern theme. Rooms are simple but fulfill their purpose But what impressed me the most was how really friendly and helpful the staff was. Thank you very much for our time there",5,2020,01,03
243,City break temple bar district,"Great location for all you need and want in Dublin. In the temple bar district everything within walking distance. 
Rooms small yet very cosy and comfy. 
Very cost effective. 
Close to Guinness Storehouse ",5,2020,01,03
243,Great Value and Friendly Service,"I cannot find fault with this new Hotel. The location just opposite St Stephens Green Shopping Centre Car Park is an ideal base for a shopping trip to Dublin City Centre. The staff were extremely friendly and competent. The rooms are modern and comfortable if on the small side, but since you don't spend much time in them bar sleeping this is not a problem. We had dinner in the restaurant and the food was excellent and service once again top class. The one small mistake with the wine was handled with a sense of humour  by the waitress which got the table laughing. The value for money was 10 out of 10. . ",5,2020,01,03
243,Perfect place,"I took my boyfriend away for his 21st to go to jamesons and guiness and then pubs and bars for a surprise and even I was surprised at how great the hotel was. I booked it not knowing a lot and for a hotel that has only opened in August it is one of the best. Staff were all so friendly and always greeted you and asked what you were up to today.
The rooms were not big but it was a perfect size and enough storage for everything and the biggest bed I will ever lay in,in almost forgot my boyfriend was there! Great location as a 1 minute walk until you're in the top end of the town and also always 10 or less minutes to anything else. Even jamesons and guiness were a 20 minute walk, but worth the walk to explore dublin. Definitely worth staying at The Marlin and thank you to all the staff 😊",5,2020,01,03
243,Great hotel! Great Location,"We had a great night away in The Marlin Hotel.
We loved the interior so new & modern.
Check in was easy as you check yourself in with an electronic device- staff were available to assist should we have needed.
Our room was perfect, bed was large. Very clean.

Location was brilliant- car park right across the road & a few steps away from Grafton St.

We will defiantly return",5,2020,01,02
243,You can smell the newness,"Really nice and clean modern hotel situated perfectly, friendly and attentive staff. My only gripe was the positioning of the bed, positioned against the wall which meant me climbing over my partner in the middle of the night to get to the toilet 🚽 ",4,2019,12,31
243,Modern cool hotel,Funky modern design. Very friendly staff. Great choice for breakfast buffet (hot and cold) and excellent service. Superb location with a tiny gym (no gym showers though they have the room for them in nearby toilets).,4,2019,12,31
243,Very disappointed ,"We stayed at The Marlin just before Christmas. The Hotel is ideally located in the heart of the city. First impressions were great. Check in was a bit slow but staff were friendly.

We went out for the evening and returned to our room after midnight. When I pulled back the bed sheets, they were stained with what looked like fake tan. The pillow was also destroyed in it. We rang reception and the night manager came up and took photos of the bed and asked housekeeping to change it. The night manager offered us free breakfast but we refused and asked for a full refund which was eventually given the next day.

The staff were very understanding and courteous. The housekeeping staff should have never of left the bed in such a state. We didn't get to bed until after 2am because of it.

We arrived down for breakfast the next morning (which we payed for) and there was hardly any food left in the hot buffet and it was slow to be restocked. We had to go and ask for tea and coffee. No butter on our table. It would seem the staff could do with some more training

Overall, the Marlin has potential to be a great hotel but unfortunately we were left very disappointed. ",2,2019,12,31
243,Amazing hidden gem ,"We stayed two nights over Christmas and we were pleasantly surprised. Right in Dublin City centre, close to shopping, great bars and restaurants.
Great hotel for business and couples, clean  quirky rooms, we loved it.
Staff are very friendly, Defo our kind of hotel.. 
Well done Marlin ",5,2019,12,30
243,Amazing hotel ,"I stayed here twice in December, the first time for work and I was so impressed I came back with my husband and 5yr old. The service is excellent, very child friendly. The decor is modern, the rooms are small but they make excellent use of the space. Spotless clean. The food was amazing and the breakfast had the best choice yet I have seen for small kids in any hotel.,Very central location, would highly recommend for business and pleasure. An easy 5 star for me. Well done guys.",5,2019,12,29
243,Marlin review,"Great modern hotel with a very unique room, bed was fantastic and the only thing that I would say was a small problem was that there was no carpark, but this was only because we stayed so close to Christmas the local car parks were busier than usual.",4,2019,12,25
243,The perfect hotel!!,Wow is all I can say! This is a stunningly beautiful designed hotel. The staff are super kind and each have excellent customer service skills and were extremely friendly. The bed was the cosiest I have ever slept in. There’s a really nice chill out area and I spent some time there the next day. Was an ideal location as well right in the centre. Book this hotel you won’t be disappointed!,5,2019,12,24
243,Excellent find in the most perfect location,"First visit and we were delighted. 2 minute walk to everywhere. Bright spotless and comfortable room. Welcoming and friendly staff. Glad we booked a slightly bigger room though! Just a fun place to stay. Wishing them every success, as only open since summer 2019. Will be back for sure! ",5,2019,12,23
243,Fantastic service,Great stay; the staff really took care of me when my booking was messed up. Bed was comfortable and breakfast was delicious. The location is really central and safe to get to. I would definitely come back again!,5,2019,12,23
243,Christmas night out,Family night out for Christmas and we stayed in the hotel from check in to check out everything was very good staff to rooms were on point would stay again.bar area was quite cosy and relaxing.hotel is very central ,4,2019,12,23
243,"Fantastic Hotel, Staff and Location ","Stayed here for a Christmas party recently. The hotel is in a great location, close to shops, bars and restaurants in the city centre. Upon arrival we were greeted by a concierge called Marc who did an Express check-in for us. The next morning on check out Marc went the extra mile again. Look forward to coming back here. Highly recommended ",5,2019,12,20
243,Great Modern Hotel,"Wonderful hotel.  Very modern and unique.  Staff was amazing, friendly and helpful.  One of the staff went so far as to offer me his bus card when I lost mine!  
The rooms are very basic and on the smaller side, but really all you need it for is to sleep so it was perfect.
The food and drinks were well priced.  Fish and chips (fries) is a must order! The restaurant staff were also very helpful and kind.
Location is awesome!!  In a very quiet area.  Just a few streets from Grafton.  A few blocks easy walk to bus stop.  St. Stephens shopping center is just down the block.",5,2019,12,18
243,Great stay,"Well, i was pretty happy about the friendly, polite and funny staff of the hotel. Even tho theres no free netflix and our loudspeakers in the shower didnt work, I still give it 5/5.. the location is perfect too!",5,2019,12,18
243,Business & Leisure,"Hotel &Staff excellent room ideal for a short stay would opt for larger size option in future but didn't know it was available .Will use hotel again food service and above all staff and location  to Dublin town
were excellent We booked via a booking agent do book direct standard rooms are Metro style quite small well appointed brilliant for younger people my age we like a bit more space and they also have it just ask . ",5,2019,12,18
243,"Cool atmosphere, overpriced breakfast","All in all, we enjoyed staying at the Marlin. It’s quiet and clean, the staff is nice and helpful (especially the concierge). It is very central, in the “good” center, few minutes walk from the Molly Malone statue. 
The lobby is very beautiful and has great young urban atmosphere, with lots of working posts, a coffee booth with excellent coffee.
I think you should know two things before booking: first, the rooms are tiny. Very  well planned considering, but still very small and basic. You won’t be able to unpack and you will probably live off your suitcase. It’s not that bad if you cone for 2-3 nights or if you are alone in the room.  Second, breakfast is pretty basic and not that great. Reminded me of low cost b&bs, while it is not low cost at all (eur16.5 and not included in the fairly expensive hotel price). 
Bottom line, it’s great for a short stay, and eat breakfast somewhere else.",4,2019,12,17
243,A gem in Dublin City center,"I had the absolute pleasure of staying at the Marlin on the weekend of Dec 13th. To say my stay was nothing short of excellence is an understatement. Everything from the location, to the decor, to the facilities, to my room were top notch, but if there was one standout it was the staff. On arrival I was met by Andy in the front office, Andy is the type of employee any hotel should have and want. His sheer ability to make sure everyone was welcomed and assisted at check-in, whist ensuring right throughout your stay everything was taken care of. He welcomed every guest with such enthusiasm and never forgot my name throughout my stay, nothing less than an exceptional customer excellence. But this continued right throughout all the employees. I would have no hesitation in recommending the Marlin to any future traveller to Dublin ⭐️⭐️⭐️⭐️⭐️",5,2019,12,17
243,"Good Hotel, but Needs a Few Minor Improvements","We stayed at the Marlin for about 5 days. Most the staff we encountered were friendly and helpful with the exception of 1 younger staff member who seemed pretty clueless. We had a little issue with our Executive room, but the situation was handled promptly by the concierge named Mark (I believe that was his name), and we moved rooms. This man needs promoted, as he does a fantastic job, and is great with the customers. 

We stayed in an Executive room, which is definitely a good size by European standards. We had a King size bed (which was amazingly comfortable), and there was air conditioning in the room as well. We also loved that they had Chromecast on the TV so we could stream some of our favorite Netflix shows while on vacation during the rainy days. 

My biggest issues with this hotel centers around the bathroom. First off, the door into the bathroom has no way to be propped open. I am a germaphobe, and don't want to be consistently opening the bathroom door when I am going in and out to try to get ready. There should be some sort of magnetic option on the door bumper to allow the door to be propped open if needed. We wound up sacrificing one of our towels to keep the door propped open when we needed to. The 2nd thing is, this hotel does not provide any type of wash/face cloths! I have traveled all over the world, and have never come across such a hotel, especially one that claims to be a 4 star. How are women (or even men for that matter) supposed to wash their faces?! I found this as the biggest annoyance as trivial as this sounds. I called down to housekeeping twice while we were there hoping to obtain some, and both times I was told they did not have any. I was tempted to go buy my own, but invested in disposable makeup remover wipes while there. Very wasteful for the environment, but had no other choice at that point. Please, invest in some face/wash cloths for your guests! Even if they are by request only! 

Overall, would we stay again? Probably. The staff was all pleasant for the most part, breakfast was definitely worth the extra money in my opinion, the bar was great, and the room (minus the bathroom) are fresh and big by European standards if you book the Executive rooms.",4,2019,12,17
243,Superb in every way,I stayed here for 1 night with my partner last weekend. 100% would stay here again. Rooms give a futuristic feel. Beds are quite big and so comfortable. Black out blinds at the switch of a button and the shower was really powerful. Every single member of staff that we met were so friendly and obliging in any way they could help. Always greeted with a smile. Bar had a lovely atmosphere.. We had lunch and dinner here and the food was fab. The decor was quirky with a warm atmosphere. Definitely one of the best hotels in Dublin I've stayed in,5,2019,12,16
243,Birthday night away ,"
I stayed here with my husband and 4 year old boy. My parents also stayed too. We stayed for 1 night last Saturday. We were celebrating my birthday. 

Check in:
Was fast and friendly. Yet no mention of my birthday which was the reason we were there. However, I think they mixed my birthday with my mam as they got a happy birthday message and chocolates in their room!

Room:
I had booked a suite as we had our 4 year old with us. It was big and modern. The sofa bed was very comfortable. The only thing was there was no milk in the room for making tea/ coffee. 

I loved the fact that the bedroom and the sittingroom could be divided into two rooms as there was a sliding door. This was very handy. 

Something that bothered me but probably wouldn’t bother others was that none of the windows open in the room. It has floor to ceiling windows which are amazing but for me I love abit of fresh air in hotel rooms! It’s only something small though.

Our room was on the 4th floor which overlooked office buildings on the left. I would have preferred a higher floor.

My parents had a deluxe double on the 6th floor and it was fab. They had a massive floor to ceiling window with lots of natural light coming in. They were overlooking flats to the right of the hotel but had views of the mountain in the background.

Hotel bar/ breakfast
We ended up staying in the bar all Saturday evening as it was lovely and chilled. There was a really good jazz band playing (I’m not even a jazz fan but it was lovely). Our plan was to go to a bar elsewhere but we all were very happy staying here. The bar is lovely and the ground floor area and areas are lovely. They are well designed and so spacious. 

Breakfast was lovely only thing was they don’t do poached eggs. The orange juice wasn’t great either but everything else was really nice.

Our room was very expensive... would I pay what I paid for it again... no way but I do think I’d ask for a room similar to what my parents had on the 6th floor. The location is amazing and the staff were friendly. We also all got a great nights sleep as rooms were so quiet.",4,2019,12,16
243,Lovely stay in Dublin,"Wonderful hotel near Grafton Street, in the very city center! Rooms are very clean and quiet. High quality services and the beautiful design of the common spaces are a plus. The breakfast buffet is very rich. Highly recommended! ",5,2019,12,16
243,Romantic trip,"Everything was great. Location spot on for local pubs and eating places. Perfect  night's sleep, huge massive bed, lovely big TV. Couldn't fault staff, super helpful. Everything was exceptional, brilliant quirky hotel. Staff organised taxi to airport early morning no problem. Would recommend to anyone and will be booking up again next year to go back. ",5,2019,12,16
243,Not as good as I had hoped,"I really like this concept/ style of hotel- lots happening on the ground floor and small, simple rooms with all you could possibly need for a short stay. The Marlin sounded exactly like that so I couldn't wait to check it out, but for me the rooms fell short of expectations.
Staff were great, friendly and welcoming all the time but the rooms just lacked something for me. I don't think 3 hangers is sufficient, there are no tea/coffee making facilities (and sometimes in the morning you just want to take it easy without having to go downstairs) and there is no fridge. I've stayed in multiple hotels of this concept including the Dean, Devlin, Bullitt Belfast etc and all have smaller rooms yet offer these amenities and more for around the same price per night.

I would go back purely on the basis of their friendly staff, excellent location and exceptional comfy beds but feel that in terms of value there are just better options available if like me this is your style of hotel. To be fair, the hotel is still new and finding its feet so maybe some of these things will change.",4,2019,12,16
243,1 Night in Dublin,Great  location & very comfortable modern trendy hotel with all modern comforts. Good breakfast choice and friendly efficient staff. Only negative feedback is the bathrooms are bit small and not shelves for stuff. The door keeps closing over ,5,2019,12,16
243,Perfect hotel for dublin,"This new hotel has the perfect location for a weekend in Dublin walking distance to the main shopping area and attractions right on your doorstep.

Spacious deluxe rooms and great service.  

Positives...breakfast...staff..welcome....service ...spacious rooms ....relaxed....good city access...design....service...parking can be an issue in Dublin but st Stephen's green parking is opposite the hotel.

Negatives...No room service. ",5,2019,12,16
243,Great Stay,"I stayed in the hotel for 1 night for a Christmas work night out. The location is great, within walking distance of St. Stephens Green and Dame Street. The room was perfect for what I needed, clean and comfortable. 

Check out time is a bit early at 11am most hotels usually do a 12pm check out particularly at weekends but other than that I could not fault anything.

The porter who assisted me with my check in is a credit to the hotel.",5,2019,12,16
243,Central Location - good value for money,"a nice stay, staff were friendly. The room and hotel was always clean.   The hotel is located in central Dublin.  Not the cheapest, but I guess it represents pretty good value for money.   Provides a good location to meet business partners.  recommended.",4,2019,12,15
243,Very good ,"Lovely hotel right in the heart of the city centre. We had 2 executive rooms so there was plenty of space in them and they had king size beds. Accommodation was very comfortable and we were pleasantly surprised that we couldn’t hear any noise from Christmas party goers in the corridors or outside the hotel. I just felt as a new hotel some of the staff weren’t 100% confident in their duties mainly it seemed to be from lack of training. There was confusion on both check in and check out regarding my reservations and rates even though I was told on check in that it was all sorted. At breakfast I was speaking with a member of staff who was a very nice young man but whilst talking with me he used the “F” word mid conversation. I know that he didn’t mean to offend me but I don’t think it’s appropriate. After we checked out we met my sister and her partner for a coffee in the lobby. We ordered 3 coffees and a tea. He asked if we were staying at the hotel and I said that myself and my husband just checked out but my sister and her partner weren’t staying. He said there would be no charge for me and my husband which I thought was vey nice. When the drinks arrived my husband tea was being charged for. When we questioned it he said that because he had to get the tea from behind the bar he had to charge for it but the coffee was from the machine so that was free. What we thought was a lovely gesture from the hotel and a “wow” factor now just seemed to be a bit stingy. All in all we really enjoyed our stay, the staff were all lovely but as I said just a bit more training needs to be done. ",4,2019,12,14
243,Perfect for 1 night,Everything I needed for short overnight stay in Dublin. Accommodation is compact and fun. Pod-like style room. Felt like I was in a posh campsite only I could lock the door and has a super comfy bed and pillows. Staff very pleasant.,5,2019,12,14
243,Nice hotel in good location ,"Stayed here 3 times recently whilst working in Dublin.

The standard room configuration is small, being the width of your bed, but is adequate for short business trips.

Nice bar serving moretti and Perroni, so ticks that box for me and the food was pretty good as well.

Small gym which is quiet.

The location is great, within walking distance of all the good restaurants and bars in the St Stephen area and 5 mins from Temple Bar if that’s your cuppa tea! 

",5,2019,12,13
243,Great hotel for a quick visit!,"Stayed here last week after a concert.
Fabulous facilities, great location, super design. No wasted space. Lovely staff. Car park concession. Very new so still spotless. Rooms are basic but have everything you need. Big comfy bed, great blackout blinds. 
Definitely stay again as a couple. Couldn't imagine a family wanting to stay here, though maybe there are different family rooms available?",5,2019,12,12
243,Excellent hotel,"I’ve stayed in a few hotels in Dublin for business in recent months and this one was the best. It is a new hotel with vibrant decor and the staff really go out of their way to help you. Buffet breakfast was lovely - lots of choice. The only thing I would suggest is perhaps having more than one coffee machine as queues build up quickly. The room itself was really comfortable - would have been nice to have a kettle with tea/coffee but that’s just a minor comment. Location is excellent, you’re right in the heart of everything in the southside of the city. I would 100% stay again next time I’m in Dublin.",5,2019,12,12
243,Brand new so they are still learning,Very clean and nice brand new hotel. They are still picking up some issues example there are no kettles in the rooms and no room service so if you want a cup of tea in the morning you have to get dressed and go out or down to the bar which is a pain. The room I had was small but adequate. The lack of a wardrobe is only bearable if you are flying solo. 3 coat hangers on a wall don't suffice really. Staff really helpful especially the good looking guy that stands by the self check in really personable. Chamber maid refreshed my bathroom one day but didn't make the bed apart from that it was all 90% positive. I would stay again but would have a bigger room and insist on a kettle,4,2019,12,11
243,Excellent location and service,Recently stayed here for a weekend in Dublin.  The location of the hotel was excellent.  Rooms were small but very clean and the breakfast buffet was great.  I found all the staff extremely friendly and I will return again.,5,2019,12,11
243,First time and definitely not the last.,"Fantastic hotel. Incredibly original, great styling and one of the best hotel beds I've slept on, not to mention largest. It's so large it could fit (it seems) at least four people. The shower could have e had stronger water stream but that's just nitpicking. The breakfast was generous and fresh. ",5,2019,12,10
243,.,"Tiny room but as advertised.  Staff friendly.  Concierge (Mark) very helpful with suggestions. A little difficult to find at first but in good location, quiet but accessible.  Breakfast buffet good.  Only oddball thing was very late housekeeping, often not until after 5:00 pm.",4,2019,12,10
243,Great hotel,"Brand new hotel right in the heart of Dublin.  The place is super modern and looks similar to the pod style hotels in New York. The rooms are fairly compact (small) but ideal for short breaks in the city. They offer discount in the car park across the road at €20 for 24 hours which is very convenient.
",5,2019,12,10
243,Poor planning,"Myself and my partner stayed at the Marlin hotel for 2 nights, Fri 6th December to Sun 8th December. 

Unfortunately, on our first night there was loud music until the early hours due to a party in the restaurant. I initially phoned at 22.30 to be told that it would be turned off at 23.30/ 00.00 however, the music continued after this time. After numerous complaints from myself and partner in face and over the phone, the night manager reluctantly moved us at 1.00am to another room as it felt that he didn't want to distrube the party and turn the music down or off. Poor planning and making us feel like we're being unreasonable ruined our first night and the day after in Dublin

",2,2019,12,10
243,Birthday Treat 🥂,"Stayed at the Marlin Hotel on Saturday night, everything about the hotel is fabulous, from the decor to the staff. Interior is just fab in it, we stayed in one of the suites, and it didn’t disappoint.. only thing was there was no tea/coffee facilities, but as soon as it was mentioned to the reception staff, it wasn’t long until the were knocking on the door with a kettle & teas/coffees. Staff are fantastic in it, so friendly & helpful. Will definitely be back to it, location is just perfect too.",5,2019,12,09
243,"New, central, everything you need!","We stayed in the Marlin on a Thursday night. I was on business and brought my Mum. The staff were super friendly throughout our stay but in particular on arrival. We were upgraded to a twin room as the smaller double rooms are more suited to couples. The hotel is located 2 mins from Stephen's green but without the exorbitant costs. We had to wait until 3pm for our room but didn't mind. After lunch and a bit of shopping we returned. The room is small but served our needs. It was really clean, comfortable and did have separate mattresses on the bed. The views from our room were of flats across the road, not the best, but the hotel is so nice you don't mind. Dublin needed a hotel like the Marlin! We'll be back :) loved our stay!",5,2019,12,09
243,Great Location,"Stayed here for three nights, hotel in great location close to St Stephens Green and Grafton Street shopping areas. Our room was overlooked by an office block but with blackout blinds this did not cause a problem. Room was compact but clean however we only had the room cleaned once while we we there. No tea or coffee making facilities and had to phone housekeeping to request some more water which was not routinely replenished. Air conditioning seemed to be either hot or cold, got very warm overnight. Didn’t really have the need to speak to the staff as only approached at check-in and check-out. The only issue I had was with the conceierge Andy who said he could book hop-on/off bus tickets, who disappeared with my credit card for 20 minutes and then came back and the tickets were the same price as they would have been if I had paid direct, didn’t get a receipt for the card either, something to be aware of.  I thought it was a bit overpriced but as the taxi driver said on the way back to the airport “you paid for the location” probably wouldn’t return to this one.",4,2019,12,09
243,Great Location,"Great location close to St Stephens Green and Grafton Street. A bit overpriced for what it was, room only cleaned once while we where there and had to phone housekeeping to ask for more water for the room to be asked “did you get water this morning madam?” Felt like I was asking for something extra!",4,2019,12,09
243,BIRTHDAY BREAK IN DUBLIN,"The Marlin is a very new hotel opened approx 3/4 months, there are a few teething problems which are to be expected on opening a brand new hotel. But I am certain once they resolve these problems this is going to be a fantastic hotel.
The style of the hotel is very modern and quirky, loved the decor and the layout of the lobby and restaurant/bar area. There is a great photo booth that allows you to take pictures and e-mail to yourself at no cost, saw lots of people using this, lots of giggles.  
The room itself was lovely, we booked one of the suites as a treat and it did not disappoint. As mentioned there are a few issues that I am sure can be fixed and ironed out. ie. toilet seat was loose, Chrome cast on the tv didn't work, carpet in the living area had a large bubble in it, not quite flatted down right. No tea or coffee facilities in room, nothing in the mini fridge. Granted not all hotels offer this service and when we highlighted it the staff were very quick to send tea and coffee up to the room. Nothing was too much trouble for the staff they were superb. 
When we could not get the chrome cast to work someone was up straight to take a look at it, and even though they were not able to resolve there and then we were later given drinks vouchers to use at the bar. Which was a great gesture. 
We were unfortunate to have one of the staff spill a drink which splashed onto my husbands white shirt, again staff were great. They arranged to have the shirt dry cleaned and gave us a round of drinks. So all good
All though we had a few problems I have to say what really made this hotel great was the friendly welcoming staff, I would definitely stay again we were made to feel very welcome. I'd like to say thank you to all the staff at The Marlin, you made our stay very memorable. ",4,2019,12,09
243,"Great Hotel, great location","I believe this nice hotel is only 3 months old. Its in a great location smack bang in the middle of everything. It has simply designed bedrooms which are perfect for short stays. I was there on business so the reception area was the perfect location to grab a coffee, log on to the free WiFi and do a little bit of work before my meeting.",4,2019,12,09
243,Nice modern hotel near the cosmopolitan buzz of Dublin,"My partner and I stayed here for the weekend in December 2019. The modern and funky airy feel to the reception area and communal areas was welcomed and the customer service on the nights we stayed was excellent and polite

we very much liked the security whereby you had to use your keycard to get the elevator to move to your selected floor and also to gain access to the stairwell 

Our room was small but very clean and had everything we could want for our stay. Very much recommended",4,2019,12,08
243,Location -Magic at marlin.,"A real find - a new hotel.  My stay was idyllic , loved the public spaces, the reading library, the bar and very tasty menu. I wanted to ship back to Vancouver the Very comfy bed. I’m a picky traveller and this hotel ticked all the boxes - attractive room rates too. ",5,2019,12,07
243,Top Modern,"We were here with family members on a Saturday night. Being a new hotel it is clean and funky.
The rooms are small but that is the same as any new modern hotel, the days of large spacious rooms in new hotels are gone unless paying for the deluxe rooms. This is not a complaint, just an observation. 
These continental style rooms are fine for a one or two night stay. The room we stayed in had a very large and comfortable bed but unfortunately it is all on one wall which means that both occupants have to get in and out of the same side, this is very awkward having to climb over your husband/wife to do so. I can't image my 70 year old parents enjoying that (or being capable of it).

They do have a more spacious room with the bed in the middle of the room and plenty of space to move around it. This room also comes with an accessible shower for those with mobility issues.

We ate in the bar and had the burger which was excellent! One of the tastiest ""gourmet"" burgers I have had. You could tell they pride themselves with the quality of the ingredients. Other family members had the fish and chips which also got the thumbs up.

The bar also is the breakfast room. 
Breakfast was buffet style and was very good in choice (tho a wider choice of yogurt than just natural plain would be nice) and quality. The only negative is the single coffee machine which has queuing for it . Tea is table service.

Don't linger there too long as check out is 11:00 and the card key for your room with shut off and won't work the elevator or the room door after that time which will mean a trip back to reception to get it activated again.

The staff are excellent, friendly and helpful, exactly what every hotel should have. 

Location is also perfect for the city centre, you could really ask for much better. What we paid for our stay was excellent value for a city centre location.

Highly Recommended ",5,2019,12,07
243,Nice find,"Nice quaint funky hotel , centrally located with a few minutes of Stephen green and Grafton street, discount parking just across the straight, €20 for 24 hrs, rooms small but very functional, good selection for breakfast . Staff very nice and attentive ",4,2019,12,04
243,Fab experience,"This hotel has it all - it’s quirky, new & so comfortable. With various areas in the reception area to sit & relax to the spacious bar. The room was described as cozy king & it was! The king size bed filled the full end of the room (I feel sorry for housekeeping changing the sheets!) but the room has everything you need for a comfy stay. A stones throw from the Stephen’s Green & Grafton Street, it really is in a great location. Will definitely be back!",5,2019,12,04
243,Great addition to the area.,As someone who lives in the area i regularly call in for coffee or a drink. A real super cool place with great decor. The staff are always very friendly and accommodating. The food is great too. Loved the seafood chowder.,5,2019,12,04
243,Very Comfortable and Modern,"Love the cosiness of the room. The bed was huge and so comfortable. Very ergonomic hotel. The food is excellent, really enjoyed the menu and the breakfast. The staff were really friendly, the hotel is beautifully designed and it's a really enjoyable experience to hang out there. The location is second to none. You are Directly in the city centre. The bedrooms were clean, but there was an issue with our sink where the water wouldn't drain because the plug wouldn't lift up fully. ",5,2019,12,04
243,Great place for a Christmas Party,I organised our staff party (for 35) in the Marlin.  I was slightly apprehensive beforehand since it was a new hotel and I had no experience of their food etc.  I needn't have been! It was a great venue.  The area we had was really Christmassy and the service and food were excellent.  I would have no hesitation in booking this hotel for an event in the future.  A special word of thanks to Kirsten in Sales for her assistance in organising the event.,5,2019,12,04
243,Merlin magic ?,"Bright new hotel,/Liked interesting interior ..Bedroom pleasant well equipped comfy bed .Good food great breakfast.Excellent General Manager and reception team, pleasant and efficient restaurant service.Disliked  self help check in impersonal! No room service !No bar snacks eg nuts crisps etc.Queues at single Coffee machine at breakfast. No biscuits in bedroom very mean as no room sevice.With  a few basic improvements could be a great Hotel. We enjoyed our stay ,will return in future.Thank you.",4,2019,12,03
243,So fab,"Stayed here for a girls night out in Dublin. The hotel is so quirky and fresh. We came back to the hotel bar after being out for dinner, fab bar and the staff were brilliant. One guy in particular (wearing a suit, who’s name I didn’t get) could not have been more helpful. I look forward to my next visit",5,2019,12,03
243,"Great location, tiny room","The hotel is superbly located for visiting Dublin and did not disappoint, however the Cosy Room is more compact than cosy and not having a place for our clothes (two adults, five days) was a bit of an issue. Also, disappointed the standard kettle found all around Ireland was not standard in our room.",4,2019,12,03
243,"The kindest, most welcoming concierge in Ireland","Randall was the most welcoming concierge I’ve ever met - him alone would make me want to stay at this hotel again. The Marlin is very very lucky to have him as a staff member. The hotel is class - new, clean, central. Perfect",5,2019,12,02
243,Amazing!,"We knew from the photos this was going to be a quirky hotel and we definitely wanted to give it a go!
Check in self-service was really easy to use and efficient (and there was a staff member also present offering to check us in if you don't consider yourself tech-savy!)

Room was small, but perfect! We did not need a bigger size. The shower was lovely, huge flatscreen TV mounted to the wall that we could stream our phone to also! And there was a connected speaker in the bathroom which was interesting! The bed was the most comfortable bed I've ever slept in, in my life!

We also dined in the hotel's restaurant. Food was amazing, although a bit pricey (but you expect that in dublin!) I had the steak which was amazing, but it only came with exactly 6 chips (chunky). My boyfriend got the fish and chips (skinny fries) which had more than enough in its portion to feed us both, so we didn't mind the smaller portion with the steak.

The bar has one of the biggest range of drinks I've ever seen. Staff were so friendly and lovely and really paid attention to us. The lounge area was so comfortable, big couches, individual vinyl players available and a whole library of books to choose from.

We got an amazing price of 126euro for the night (figuring as it's new, I expect this will go up in the future) but even if it does I would happily pay more to stay here again!",5,2019,12,02
243,Honeymoon,Perfect walking distance to temple bar area as well as Grafton street. New and modern hotel. Very clean. Fun and beautiful atmosphere. Highly recommend. Staff was very helpful. Upgraded us for honeymoon. ,5,2019,12,02
243,Impressed,"Just back fro a weekend in dublin. From the moment we entered the hotel, we were impressed. Check in staff were very friendly and chatty. Our package included a complimentary drink and full irish breakfast. Food was delicous. Staff very helpful. Bed was so comfortable.  
Will definitely be staying again. Great location. ",5,2019,12,02
243,Quick Visit,"Small rooms but comfortable, clean and friendly staff. Ideal for a short business trip. If staying longer, I'd request a bigger room but seeing this was a single person visit, can't really complain. I'd definitely stay again.",4,2019,12,02
243,great hotel,"the hotel is new and spotless-the open lounge at ground floor is relaxed and good for solo travellers
rooms are just right-the only criticism iOS lack of hooks in the bathroom for towels and boathook in the bedroom
staff are friendly and helpful",5,2019,12,02
243,Great modern hotel,"Being built this year we expected a contemporary hotel but the Marlin was absolutely fabulous. The check in is done via a screen and the whole lobby is straight out of Instagram - to say they are with the times would be an understatement. The room was a little small but that was purely because the bed is so massive, so not exactly a bad thing! The only negative would be the lack of a wardrobe. You get a big drawer under the bed but that means you must fold all of your clothes, and there isn’t anywhere to put your suitcases so the room can get cluttered - for the price it is a bit of a downer. ",5,2019,12,01
243,Great stay....,"Huge and amazingly comfortable bed!! The room and bathroom was completely spotless, maybe not used yet... Hotel apparently opened this year according to the taxi driver. Breakfast was delicious, lots of choice and all very fresh, all staff were very polite and helpful. Would definitely stay again. ",4,2019,12,01
243,Restaurant Visit,"This is a restaurant is in the Merlin Hotel in Dublin Stephen's Green Centre. Had a great meal at reasonable price , full bar menu wine list good, great dinner menu with plenty of choice , staff friendly and attentive",4,2019,11,30
243,overnight in dublin,"Really loved our stay in the marlin, quirky bedroom but perfect size. The bed is big and extremely comfy (didn't want to get out of it this morning). Big TV with good selection of tv and radio channels, at the foot of the bed and a speaker in the bathroom..nice. You can also stream from your phone, netflix etc.Loved the rain shower also. The downstairs area is cool and loads of nooks and crannys to scroll away the time. With it's location behind the stephens green car park, it's location is perfect. It will be my goto hotel in town from now on..",5,2019,11,30
243,"Small rooms, but all you need","Great hotel in general, noisy wake-up from bin lorries at 6am which was annoying. Comfy beds. Easy check-in/checkout. Very close to Grafton Street and shopping centre and would recommend/stay here again",4,2019,11,30
243,"Great location, freshand funky decor","Cool decor, friendly staff, reasonably priced and great location.
Front desk staff are helpful, polite, friendly, as are the bar and waiting staff. Quiet for business trips even though its not a business hotel. Beds are fantastic. ",5,2019,11,30
243,Fantastic,"I loved this hotel. It’s modern, clean with friendly staff. I had a cosy room, which although may not have much space for storage etc, was perfect for one person staying. The bed was possibly the biggest ives ever slept in and super comfy. Location great as right next to St Stephens Green. Overall I would highly recommend and will surely be back!",5,2019,11,29
243,Great hotel ,We had a lovely stay here. Such a cool retro hotel. Very convenient. Park in at Stephens green shopping centre for 20€ Beautiful breakfast. I Would definitely recommend it. Very convenient for Grafton street shopping 😊,5,2019,11,26
243,Great stay,"Food was lovely. My server Sophie was lovely to talk to, very quick polite and friendly. The gym was also very good and I enjoyed a good workout there. 

The room was very comfortable and I relaxed in there to work. Would definitely visit again.

Regards",5,2019,11,25
243,Lovely stay,Me and my boyfriend have just stayed at this lovely hotel. It looks absolutely gorgeous and the decor is great. We both slept very well both nights on the big comfy bed. The only things that could be improved are: there was only 3 hangers for clothes which quite frankly isn’t enough for 2 people staying more than 1 night. The rooms could also benefit from tea and coffee facilities. Apart from these 2 things the hotel was great with a central location and we also loved the bar. We will return!,4,2019,11,25
243,Very disappointed ,"I just checked into the Marlin. Off a 10 hour flight. Check in was rude, took the whole price for the stay upfront off my card, no receipt, no explanation. Didn’t even ask if I wanted to charge meals etc to room. Hence I had to go all the way upstairs to get my credit card to pay for the meal I just ate. Downstairs is nice and funky. The rooms - disaster. In fact I am feeling so claustrophobic, on the verge of checking out. The room is sooo tiny. No room to store suitcase, 3 hangers for clothes. Not even hair conditioner in the room and towels are grey. Can’t fit laptop or tablet in the safe. When I get off the toilet I hit the wash basin and fall into the shower. Overpriced, wannabe hip hotel. Such a pity as the location is ace. ",1,2019,11,24
243,"Modern, eclectic design. Great service","The hotel is very modern and up to date. It has a clean gym, and a lounge. 

The restaurant was friendly with good food and drink. My server, Sophie, was prompt and friendly. I would dine here again. 

In fact, I would return even if I stayed elsewhere.",5,2019,11,23
243,Xmas shopping,Absolutely love love this hotel .the staff are so obliging especially Enya who waitressed are table so nice .I will definitely be coming again the hole vibe of it was so relaxing. bedroom are Devin I wouldn't have anything negative to say about this hotel.,5,2019,11,23
243,Great location ,"Great location, rooms, breakfast, bar.... friendly helpful staff 
We will definitely stay again !
Only suggestion to improve would be two coffee machines at breakfast 👍🏻as there was a constant queue as machine was pretty slow ",5,2019,11,23
243,Great hotel,Lovely hotel with good value considering its location  Great breakfast with good choice of breakfast items Super clean rooms Helpful and friendly staff nothing is too much trouble  Great stay with good location  Thanks ,5,2019,11,19
243,Perfect!,"My partner and I spent last Saturday night at The Marlin. We had tickets for a show in The Olympia and wanted to be able to walk to and from the hotel. What a spot! Everything you could ask for practically on the doorstep. What a beautiful hotel. So cleverly designed. The rooms are compact but so tastefully decorated it's not an issue. Huge comfy bed. Staff are lovely and very helpful. Concierge is a genuinely nice guy.  We ate out so I can't comment on dinner, but we had breakfast and it was really, really good. It's buffet with a great selection. Great options for vegetarians. Best of all was the price..we paid 137 euros for a double room inc breakfast. Amazing location and hotel for that price. We will defiantly be back.",5,2019,11,18
243,Super location,"Super location, one block from St. Stephan’s Green, Grafton Street and a 9 minute walk to Dublin Castle. A very new property. Some modern art items you will never see in another hotel. Paid parking across the street. Our room was on the small side but it is Europe but very nice. Just because of the location I will stay there again.",5,2019,11,18
243,"Excellent hotel,  fabulous location","Excellent hotel,  fabulous city centre location, right beside Stephen's green shopping centre. . Small rooms. Excellent breakfast.  Decor in public  areas really cool. Staff really friendly and helpful. .",5,2019,11,18
243,Fun and unique property,"As you enter the hotel you notice this is not your parents hotel. Kiosk check in (they have some one to assist if you have challenges) with 4 kiosks, no waiting, brilliant. Lobby is very hip, stylish and fun, very youthful. ",5,2019,11,17
243,"Excellent Hotel, great location.","Hotel very modern and well located only  a few minutes walk from St Stephens green luas stop. Staff really friendly and pleasent. Would definitely recommend, suited us perfect, definitely stay again ,great value.",5,2019,11,17
243,Perfect size!,"After reading some of the negative comments about this hotel, I'm left to conclude those people just don't 'get' it. Complaints about flickering lights in the bathroom? That is under counter lighting on motion sensors. Room too well insulated you needed air con? Would you rather a room that is freezing cold? Soup too hot you got a blister on your lip? Would you rather food served to you at temperatures that grow bacteria? 

We stayed overnight here on a Saturday night, and the check in process was seamless and quick. No waiting in line, room key issued immediately and you are on your way. Room card has a map of hotel location on it, which is clever and useful for those new to the city. 
Decor is fabulous, open and airy combination of function and modern design. Green plants added everywhere to beat the concrete city feel and take you into an urban oasis. 
We stayed in the smallest size room, the cosy King, and it was more than enough space for two people. The bed was massive and super comfortable. There was underbed storage for bags, and enough hooks on the walls for jacket and handbags. A nice desk on the side of the bed and good sized bathroom with modern rainfall shower was luxury. No wasted space... Eveything had a function. All automation for lights and blinds and TV worked perfectly. My partner raved about the shower. Sure there was no tea or coffee in the room, but the cafe bar area on the main floor served some of the best coffee I've had in the city.
We left for an evening and came back at 2am and people were still enjoying the various sitting areas and bar area. It was a great vibe. 
The rest of the evening was quiet and we got a great night sleep. We slept so well we were late checking out, but that wasn't a problem. Check out was simple, again no waiting as there were multiple keyosks and an employee right there in case any errors with the machines.
Service in the bar was great and attentive. Bathrooms downstairs by the gym were spotless. Location superb. And the price was actually affordable compared to the €300+ price tag other hotels in the area were charging. Sorry, but coffee and tea in my bedroom and a bigger room with wasted space I don't use are not worth the extra money!!
Being an avid traveller, and after visiting and staying in over 22 countries, I can honestly say its our new favourite!",5,2019,11,17
243,Nice hotel with friendly staff,"Nice new hotel.
Good location for exploring the city if dublin. 
Friendly staff and very helpful. 
Very extensive breakfast buffet.
The bar is a nice place for a drink after a long day of visiting the city.

243,"Fab food, service and atmosphere","Have stayed here previously in the quirky functional bedrooms with huge beds... dinner was amazing and the modern style decor made a great night. Came in today to meet a friend for lunch. Pulled beef sandwich was so good I ate it all even though I was full after half. Sockets available to charge phones or tablets everywhere. Brought our children today and they were made feel so welcome, allowed take photos on the real Vespa in the lobby and had loads of fun in the fotobooth available for guests.
City centre, close to shops and public transport, has parking, couldn't ask for more.",5,2019,11,16
243,Wow! 5 out of 5!,"Stayed here recently for 2 nights and wow. The service from the staff was outstanding. From reception to the bar I could not fault 1 thing! Special thanks to James who checked us in on arrival. He was very pleasent and helpful. Loved the vibe in reception. Very quirky and modern. The room is amazing. Makes the most of space provided. Bed is A1 and is massive. Loved the rain shower head in bathroom and the plentiful toiletries. Had food 1 night in the 'indoor garden' and was delicious. Staff very helpful. Location is perfect, 2 minutes walk from Grafton St. Will deffo be back soon.",5,2019,11,14
243,"Great hotel, really modern.","Stayed at the Marlin for a single night.

It's a pretty new Hotel, less than a year old I believe and it is very modern.

Let's break this down into positives:

- Modern clean rooms
- Massive TV in room with Chromecast
- Lovely rainfall shower
- Electric blind and blackout blind
- UK and European plug socket at desk.
- Wired network connection (getting rarer nowadys)
- USB charging ports
- Huge and great quality super kingsize bed
- Big towels
- In room climate control
- Touchscreen self service check in (but...see below)
- Sound proofing to outside was good.
- Trendy bar area
- ""Indoor garden"" area was awesome

And the Negatives:

- Breakfast a bit below average
- Sink in bathroom drains really slowly so it's impossible to rinse out.
- HDMI socket at desk doesn't seem to be selectable on the TV despite being wired
- Standard rooms are a bit small
- Not enough storage in the room (wasn't an issue for me as only there 1 night)
- Self service check in printer got stuck so I didn't get a receipt with my room number
- No kettle or tea/coffee provisions in the room (i think you can ask)
- No lamp for more subdued lighting

But the negatives didn't add up enough to make this a 4/5 review, it's still a 5/5 and if I am back in the area i'd definitely stay here again.",5,2019,11,14
243,"Location, Funky new Hotel","Fantastic just spent the weekend here. Staff polite and helpful,  room was great the layout was a new type of concept. Making use of all the space. The downstairs area was great, so many different seating areas, nooks and crannies to sit and take it all in. One night had the bar food and the food was great. Breakfast was buffet style, but was piping hot, normally you find these cold but here the staff were on the ball. So much choice, from fresh fruit, to full fried, or porridge and oats. 
Totally recommended and will return, the location is perfect to walk everywhere. 🍀🇮🇪👍",5,2019,11,12
243,Great Getaway!,"We were warmly welcomed at Reception. Our room was bright, clean and the bed was very comfortable. The staff were very friendly. Breakfast was excellent. Service top class. We will definitely return again.",5,2019,11,12
243,At Last!,"At last, a hotel that dispenses with gimmicks and unnecessary frou-frou to provide what all travellers need: a good night's sleep. The beds at the Marlin are huge magic carpets to dreamland. And there's a FREE laundry downstairs to do your smalls. The useful communal spaces emanate from the friendly bar area. They are a mix of cosy lounge nooks for meetings and discrete tables to sit at and catch up with work. It's not just for business travellers; tourists, including young families can take advantage of its central location near Stephen's Green to enjoy the best Dublin has to offer.",5,2019,11,11
243,Wheelchair accessible hotel in an unbeatable location,Trendy and cool design hotel in unbeatable location. It is just beside Stephan's Green. The staff were genuinely warm and friendly. Room and hotel are fully wheelchair accessible (as advertised). Thanks especially to Yolanda on reception for the lovely welcome. Self service check in is also available but when I didn't manage with it Yolanda immediately came out from behind the desk and checked me in.,5,2019,11,10
243,Don't be fooled by the cheap prices,"Stayed here on Wednesday Night. Chose the hotel as it was the cheapest online. 
Self service check in was poor at best, its very dated for a hotel only new. 

Rooms are tiny, bed looks like it has been slept in when you arrive. The cleaning staff are obviously very busy doing something else. 

The bar has potential but badly run, no senior person around and drinks selection is poor. Food was compared to that of a poor hostel. 

Location is great if you want to look out your room into flats next door. 

Would not suggest you stay here.",1,2019,11,08
243,Great location and Great Service/Accomodations,Great location and Great Service/Accommodations- Highly recommended reasonably priced and the cleanliness of the hotel was impressive. The room is not a large room but okay for couples. The food was good and the ambience was excellent!! 4-1/2 stars  ,5,2019,11,08
243,VERY cool! ,"This is not just another city centre Hotel. This is an experience, this is an art work, this is very very cool and very very good. From the moment you cross the threshold and are greeted by the very special open plan space that is the check in/ reception that flows into the digital hub working areas and from there into the eating area and bar you cant but realise this is a place where business can be done and your accommodated in every aspect. The rooms are beautifully prepared and comfortable of course but it's the public areas that welcome you and where you feel you want to spend time. ",5,2019,11,07
243,Weekend visit for 2,"Fantastic stay and pleasantly surprised with how nice the hotel was! Was not expecting such a modern and well run hotel given what we saw online via photos. Even the standard rooms felt spacious and cosy, with a huge bed there was little to complain about. Don’t be put off by the sq2 on these rooms! 

The location is amazing and right in the middle of the city easy walking distance to everything of interest but not loud at night. Check in and check out was seamless and done yourself using their digital platform - even let us check into our room early at 11am in the morning vs 3pm!",5,2019,11,07
243,Central! Cosy! & Refreshing!,The hotel is great and central within the city! The online check in was very easy to use. The hotel smelt brand new! With the finest finishing! We had a slight issue with getting our key card to work in the lift but apart from that it was excellent!,5,2019,11,07
243,"Great stay, great location, will definitely be back","Solo traveler for one night in the Marlin. It is brand new, and definitely will be back to this great hotel. You cannot beat the location. The decor in the lobby and bar is fab.   For somebody on the run, self service check-in is great.  Rooms are nicely done, best TV in a hotel I have seen in a long time. Food in the bar was good, and service was quick.  The lady on the desk, cannot remember her name unfortunately was so friendly and helpful.  Breakfast the next morning lovely and fresh. Not a lot of food sitting in the dishes and topped up regularly by the looks of it. And the best thing at breakfast for me, was the self service coffee machine with a coffee selection included and drinkable. Overall great and most definitely stay again",5,2019,11,06
243,Fantastic hotel with great staff and amazing location,"We were in Dublin for the marathon. Hotel was the perfect location and so convenient for the marathon.

243,City break,Meeting old friends for night out dublin and stayed marlin. New 4 star hotel in great location. Parked across road in q park Stephen green got discount from hotel. 3min walk to gaiety theatre or Zara. Lobby and bar funky and as you would expect in new hotel . Had upgraded room to executive which was worth it for extra space. Young persons hotel or ideal for quick nites stay. Found nice cafe down road for coffees in morning . Will be back,4,2019,11,05
243,Great and modern hotel,"Fantastic, clean and well situated hotel. Staff and bar staff very friendly and helpful could not do enough and very polite and smiling. Room was compact and comfy with air con, USB ports and big TV. Only thing I missed was tea/coffee making facilities but not a big issue. Fab stay defo recommend for couples and as a professional I would recommend for business stays. 👍😍",5,2019,11,05
243,Great stay excellent staff,"When we arrived with hire car, I had been told we needed to park at a nearby parking station.

Welcomed by Mark the porter I guess.

He was excellent, said he would get us discounted rate of 20 euros for overnight parking, in addition said he would park it for us and pick it up for us when we needed it !

Took our bags to the room and quickly left before I could tip him, not the usual linger you get.

Anyway he really made to difference for us, left him a note with a tip when we left as he was off duty, hope he got it ;-)

Had dinner a couple of nights was very good and good friendly service.

Room was small but well designed.",5,2019,11,04
243,Most relaxing stay ever,"My partner and I planned one night stay in the Marlin which was for my birthday. We had booked a superior room. When we got there there is self-service check in desks (in the amazing lobby) so we used one of them which are straightforward and simple to use. When we got up to our room we realized that we had been upgraded to a suite!  It was amazing, a huge bed, a separate sitting room area, gorgeous bathroom  and more! The only thing is there was no Netflix on the TV after a lot of searching but we didn't have time to watch it anyway. The carefully adorned hotel is decorated to ensure your experience is comfortable and enjoyable. the food was delicious and reasonable priced . We got food & drinks before heading to a concert and when we arrived back we were able to purchase drinks from the bar and bring them upstairs to our room. The staff couldn't of been more helpful and polite. We would definitely head back again. ",5,2019,11,04
243,very relaxed comfortable yet modern hotel,"we had an excellent stay.  the hotel is excellent and open plan bars and restaurants.  the breakfast is particularly good, but also the general atmosphere is very relaxed and genial, with very pleasant lounge areas with books and newspapers on display, and desk areas for computer work etc.  the only criticism is that the room we had was rather small and cramped, but it was still well appointed.",5,2019,11,04
243,"Inexperienced staff, catalogue of problems.","Reception was cold, unwelcoming, self check in, similar to Heathrow airport.  Room was very small with bed pushed against a wall which looked over a housing estate.  Shower head leaked at base so could not use. LED lights kept flickering under basin. Basin did not drain properly and I could not get a signal on the TV.   The worst experience was that I left my blue Nike sports bag behind on rushing to the airport with my uninsured £4,000 Bvlgari necklace, ring and one black shoe left therein. On calling the hotel and demanding an investigation, my bag and jewellery were never found. I will not be returning. ",2,2019,11,04
243,Excellent location,Perfect location for those looking to be in the heart of the city. Rooms were clean and tidy and the reception area very welcoming. The only thing I would say is the rooms are a little small so you might feel a bit cramped if you were there as a couple. ,5,2019,11,04
243,Lovely hotel,The Marlin is a lovely  quirky designed hotel centrally located in Dublin. While the rooms are very compact they contain all the essentials. The beds are extremely comfortable & the bathroom is equipped with a rain shower. Breakfast is quite good ,4,2019,11,03
243,Friendly and Funky,"Brilliant stay at this retro style hotel - really friendly, helpful staff and clean, nice rooms which are so peaceful at night.

Only thing I would mention is the bathroom door - was just a frosted glass panel so didn’t give as much privacy as I’d like, and did cause some issues with water seeping through the underneath after a shower.

Overall lovely hotel though and would be keen to stay here again :) ",4,2019,11,03
243,"Was on track for 10/10, but very disappointed.","The hotel is nice, clean, fresh, in a brilliant location and has all the services you want. However 2 MASSIVE down sides are:

1. The green credentials are poor - as always, the literature states to reuse towels, hang them up, and to have them replaced leave them on the floor. I very carefully left them folded but they have all been replaced. 

2. We returned to the hotel at after a family night out, and were security checked. I have never had to prove my room number on return to a hotel. I felt like a criminal, and although I understand this is a security issue there are much better ways of handling it.

Overall, it’s a shame that a potentially nice hotel has been spoiled. I travel to Dublin regularly both for work and for pleasure, but I will not return OR recommend the marlin to colleagues. One of the most important factors in a hotel stay is to feel relaxed and comfortable, and tonight I don’t feel either of these. ",1,2019,11,02
243,Amazing hotel with chic interior and superb staff! 10/10.,"This hotel is 10/10! Me and my boyfriend wanted to stay somewhere affordable but fashionable too for my birthday weekend. This hotel stood out to us from the beginning but when we arrived it was just superb from the friendly, helpful staff (early check in too - efficient) and the chic appearance of the reception area. I have found throughout other hotels it has been hard to find somewhere to lounge/relax, but the Marlin provided this with some gorgeous installations which resembled living areas with gorgeous retro decoration. The nightlife within the hotel was great as well from the buzz within the restaurant/bar, which most definitely encouraged us to stay downstairs instead of going back to our room as soon as we arrived back. The overall style of the Marlin from their highly illustrative interior, how affordable it is and the amazing location (a few streets away from Grafton!) is exactly what Dublin is missing when compared to other hotels, we will definitely be back to this hotel in the future and will recommend to friends/family! 

Thank you to the Marlin staff for making us feel so welcome!",5,2019,11,02
243,Overnight stay,"Very modern and trendy, not sure I like the self check-in but as it is new and I am a technophobe I may learn to appreciate it. The room was clean, minimalistic and modern, bathrooms lovely, some of the gadgets were lost on me, the volume switch in the bathroom? but overall very nice and great location.
",4,2019,11,01
243,Solo 2 night stay.,"It's self check in but a really helpful and friendly member of staff checked me in and also checked me out on the day I left. The hotel is very modern and trendy. My room was spacious enough with a fabulous big, comfortable bed! It was very clean. My only complaint would be that the drainage in the sink was not great. Any staff members that I met were friendly. I didn't eat in the hotel so I can't make a comment. Location is ideal. It's right beside Stephens Green Shopping Centre and Grafton Street with plenty of restaurants and bars close by. I would definitely stay there again. ",5,2019,10,30
243,"Great stay, perfect location","The Marlin hotel is perfectly situated to experience the best Dublin has to offer. The hotel is modern; tastefully decorated and breathes a happy atmosphere. Well appointed room, the bathroom was a little small and the privacy was little compromised. Breakfast buffet was okay, but for a hotel of this price class one would expect a little more. Most friendly and helpful staff.",4,2019,10,30
243,Perfect location. ,"The best feature of this hotel was its location. Literally 2 minutes walk from the city centre. It’s a brand new hotel with modern decoration to my liking. King size bed, very comfortable. Good quality toiletries and fresh towels every day. Staff was friendly, helpful and accomodating. 

The bed took up most than half of the room. Due to its position, one side is placed by the wall, you can only climb in and out of bed from its one side, which is very uncomfortable when there are two people sleeping, you have to climb over the other person in order to climb in and out of bed. No closet in the room, just three hangers on the wall which is difficult when there are more than one person staying for more days. Also, not very happy with the cleaning, but maybe that was just our room that day. ",4,2019,10,29
243,"top class , centrally located hotel","Once again we stayed in the Marlin which as usual was excellent. Marie and all her staff were great...I have to give a big shout out to Andy, who was courteous and professional as always. We hope to be back before Christmas",5,2019,10,29
243,Solo adventure to Dublin,fresh and clean hotel with lovely modern rooms. Breakfast selection was good and very yummy cocktails. Staff were polite friendly approachable and very attentive. Location is perfect for everything. Majority of things are in walking distance. 100% would stay again. :),5,2019,10,29
243,Long Weekend in Dublin,New hotel in a great location convenient to Grafton St and St Stephen's Square areas. Hip contemporary decor and very comfortable rooms.  Front desk staff was welcoming and eager to assist.  Would highly recommend.,5,2019,10,29
243,Cannot Fault it!!,"Stayed in this hotel for a girly weekend with my best friend and it was amazing! Perfect location- far enough away from the bars so it was quiet, but could easily walk in and out of the temple bar area. The staff were so helpful, and we were able to check in at 11am! Beds are so comfortable, showers are lovely. Lovely little coffee shop on the ground floor as well. Literally cannot fault this hotel. Perfect!",5,2019,10,29
243,Andy in reception.,"We loved this hotel. From it perfect location to where we needed to be to its quirky and colorful decoration in the lobby area. The rooms were even better. We were lucky enough to be upgraded to a suite and boy were we impressed. It was fabulous, spacious and so comfortable. The bed was huge and slept soundly in them for the two nights we were there. The bathroom was beautiful. All very modern and on trend. 
We had food in the bar area, burger and fries but it really was so good. Staff very attentive in this area of the hotel. 
All the staff we came into contact with were so friendly but special mention has to go to Andy who helped us check in and it seemed helped everyone else check in. There was nothing that this man wouldn’t help you with, from finding safety pins for my husbands race number on the morning of the Dublin Marathon to helping another guest who was carrying too much, Andy helped his carry his purchases back to his room. He always had a smile and a chat whenever we passed by and always seemed genuinely interested in everyone. 
We will definitely return and look forward to staying here again soon.",5,2019,10,28
243,👌,"Picked this hotel for the weekend of the Dublin Marathon due into its location,and what a great decision that was.Ideal location for the race but also for a night out or shopping,loads good pubs and restaurants nearby.
Very stylish hotel too,will definitely be back.",5,2019,10,28
243,Good Location - updated hotel,"We arrived well before noon due to an early flight and were absolutely delighted to hear there was a room for us! That was fantastic since we’d planned a few activities to keep us awake and mitigate jet lag. 
So - the Hotel: Good:  location, very clean, friendly staff, efficient elevators, excellent full breakfast spread and comfortable bed, lively well-tended bar.
Fair/Not good: open door to shower - it was just too wide and impossible to direct water; no place to hang wet towels (but there was a sign asking if towels were to be re-used, hang them up?!). Our room was spare - a bit too small for two people. NOTE: if you’ve had knee surgery or are a bit less than supple, know that many of the rooms feature beds that are enclosed on three sides. Thus, the (very comfortable) queen-sized bed is only accessible from one side: it can be a challenge to scramble across the mattress!",4,2019,10,28
243,Nice ,"Stayed in this Hotel for a couple of nights over the weekend.  This is a lovely hotel and I would suggest you give it a chance. The rooms are a bit on the small side however the bed is the best I've ever slept in. A word of warning you will have to climb over you partner if you need to get up in the middle of the night as there is only one way in also if you are very tall you will need to sleep sideways.There are no views to be had because the hotel is right in the middle of an office block, a car park and residential flats. The blinds do need to be down all the time because of this and again makes the room feel small. That said the hotel is very clean and tidy. The staff are helpful and polite. I noticed some people complained about parking. St Stephen's q parking is literally across the road from the hotel and the hotel offer a discounted rate of 20 euro per 24 hours..  all you need to do is hand over your car park ticket when checking out. The bar area is used for a mixed dining area. Breakfast is nice however it appears to run out of things very quickly and you can spend a bit of time waiting for them to be replenished. On the bar note good selection of drinks are available however no irish mist at a hotel bar in dublin ??? that said the bar area is a very comfortable place to chill out following a long day wandering around the city and the Guinness is very good here. The location is very handy for seeing the sites or going shopping. All in all a very good hotel I would recommend it and would probably stay again.",4,2019,10,28
243,Exceptionally helpful staff & Perfect location!,"We had occasion recently to spend a week in Dublin.Fortunately we spent it in the newly opened  Marlin Hotel. We found the staff to be exceptionally welcoming and helpful in many different ways. This attitude obviously permeated down from the GENERAL MANAGER ,Michelle O' Donoghue to Grace in Reservations, Nadia Front Office Manager, Yolanda Receptionist, Marc, a treasure out front, Marian in the Restaurant and Aneta in Housekeeping.The staff couldn't do enough for us so thank you.The location of the Hotel is excellent for shoppers etc and has very comfortable beds.The rooms are modern and spotless and the staff exceptional.Thanks again to Michelle and all the staff.Hope to see you all soon again.",5,2019,10,27
243,Amazing,"From check-in until the time we left our stay was amazing. The relaxed vibe, with all the modern features and quirky touches were a breath of fresh air. The staff were excellent, so helpful and made both my daughter and myself feel so welcomed and relaxed. Everything was exactly as described and pictured on the website. We will definitely be back.",5,2019,10,27
243,"Do not book, warning of hotel using card fraud!!!",Had booked for the 30th/31st December with a non refundable pay on the day arrangement. Had an email three months after booking saying my credit card had declined and I would need to rebook however at an much higher additional rate. I called my bank and was put through to the fraud department. The fraud team explained there was no card payment even attempted By the hotel and that they have had numerous calls from people using the same hotel and they believe that it is a scam they are using to scam holiday makers out of additional funds. As there is three other couples coming on the same trip and using the same hotel all under different names and booked at different times. I contacted them and warned them about what had happened. They had all had the same email however had repaid the additional extortionate rate due to being embarrassed that there credit card had been supposedly declined. Please use this as a warning and do not ever use this hotel while card fraud is used so flippantly.,1,2019,10,27
243,Looks new with idea of design hotel,"Stayed there 4 nights and my stay started with lost booking (made thru HRS). Anyways, got my room which wasn't big but all was available. Bathroom with shower was big size. Air Con was not setup properly, so in the beginning had to spend time to set it, otherwise too cold. Restaurant food is good for both breakfast and dinner, but food purchases closes at 10pm and after that time there is not option to eat (nor in the room). Internet connection is stable and good.",4,2019,10,26
243,Modern new city hotel,"Thanks that the hotel consider our room wishes with the highest floor, it is just a pitty that the view is directly to the parking garage, but this is the architecture of the building in this area. The street round about the hotel is not nice, but 3 minutes away the old city starts. The nicest design is the lobby, the rooms are modern standard. Very friendly and exerted stuff and good breakfast. The price is too expensive. ",4,2019,10,26
243,Great Place,"We recently stayed at the Marlin Hotel in Dublin - two times actually, once at the start of our trip and once at the end.  We really enjoyed our stay at this super hip and modern hotel. It couldn't have been easier to check-in/out, done via a computer in the lobby. So fast and efficient. Andy was great - he will help you find your way around the hotel and city - ask him anything!  We also loved the evening security guard (A very tall man, I didn't get his name, but he was extremely kind and accommodating).  

The decor is super cute - vibrant colors and fun adornments (scooter in the lobby and a vintage coffee cart). The hotel is easy to navigate and super centrally located - 15 min walk to pretty much any attraction. Gym, full restaurant with nice breakfast buffet and bar.

The rooms were comfy, clean and spacious.  No closet, bar on the wall instead, which was fine b/c we weren't there long enough to unpack thoroughly. The bathroom is spacious and has an automatic dimmer light that goes on if you don't want to turn the full light on in the middle of the night - loved that actually.  The only thing I will mention is that the bed is pressed against 1 wall, so you have to climb over each other to get in/out of bed.  Not really a problem for us, but for others, it could be bothersome. Great TV and amenities. 

We would definitely recommend this hotel to others and will stay here again should we find ourselves in Ireland again.",4,2019,10,25
243,Quiet Hotel in the quasi-center of Dublin,"Far from the Madding Crowd of the usual business hotels, this is a new built hotel just off the very center of Dublin. Quite and comfortable to have business meetings in a number of casual spots in the lobby. Rooms are smaller then standard but comfortable and clean. Staff very nice and efficient.",5,2019,10,25
243,One of the newest hotels in the center of Dublin city (Oct 2019),"The Marlin is ‘funky’ with really cool fixtures and fittings with a relaxed vibe.
One warning!!! If you have booked online via a booking site, do NOT use the auto check in kiosks in reception, it will get you to pay again at it won’t be refunded until a day after your stay has finished.
That said, from here on in everything is spot on.
The rooms aren’t exactly huge but they are incredibly well put together with neat storage solutions.
There are some very nice touches, soft close toilet lid, a fog free mirror in the bathroom and an auto bathroom light. I say bathroom, this isn’t exactly true as there is just a shower.
The bed is built into the room, it’s huge and incredibly comfortable.
Down in the bar there is a good selection of beers.
Breakfast is a fairly standard offering of hot and cold food the fresh honey is a nice touch.",5,2019,10,24
243,Great new hotel in Dublin ,"Great new addition to Dublin City centres hotel options.
They had only been open a week when I visited so there were a few teething problems with the the computer system. The first key card I was given was for an occupied room! I had to go back and forth to reception 3 times to get a room which was a bit annoying after travelling all day, but things like this can’t be helped and the staff were extremely apologetic and very helpful.
I love the interior of the hotel and the very modern rooms, but I did miss having a wardrobe to hang my clothes up. It was fine for 1 night, but if you’re staying a few days, the lack of closet would annoy me. The rooms are also quite small which didn’t bother me as a solo traveller, but again, if you’re staying a few days and you’re travelling with someone else, it would feel cramped with having nowhere to put clothes/cases away.
Location is great, very nice breakfast and a well stocked bar. 
Overall, a really nice hotel. ",4,2019,10,24
243,Ultra Modern Hotel,"I'll be honest and say that I am more used to a traditional classic hotel style, and the Marlin took a bit of time to warm up to. We arrived late at night, and thankfully the front desk people came to greet us and check us in rather than us having to deal with the computer check-in terminals nearer the entrance. Electronic everything here,and very minimalist. Lots of instructions needed on how to use the elevator, access the room, operate the thermostat, lights, electronically operated shades. The room is quite stark. The overall style is probably more appropriate for and appealing to a younger clientele. But the bed is AMAZING! Fills half of the room from wall to wall and is a celebration of sleep. Also loved the under counter lights which go on automatically upon entering the bathroom. Negatives were the shower design which made it impossible to keep water inside, and routinely (3 nights stay) ended up in a large puddle on the floor. Even the very narrow shower opening (caution larger body types) didn't help. Designers obviously didn't have practical issues in mind. I never quite got used to the voice in the elevator announcing doors opening/closing and floor numbers...rather creepy to me. Would have loved to have in-room hot water pot and cups, but they did bring a teapot of hot water and cups to the room when I asked. Overall, the comfort of the bed and the quiet location easily accessible to transportation and sights made it a good stay. ",4,2019,10,23
243,No coffee/tea,"I stayed at one of the cosy king rooms for 4 nights. The bed was humongous and comfortable. Steps away from Grafton Street and St. Stephen’s Green Shopping Centre. The 757 Airlink Express bus stop is about a 5-6 min walk. Very nice reception area and friendly staff. Since it’s a new hotel, I wasn’t surprised to find some things that could be better. My room was cleaned each morning but they never gave me new towels or water. The TV could not connect to Google Chromecast and there were no instructions on how to use the safe. The walls were so thin that I could hear people’s voices next door. I’ve never been in hotel where I had to go downstairs in the lobby in my pajamas to pay 3 euros for a cup of coffee in the morning. Considering it’s a 4 star hotel, they should at least have a coffee maker in the room. Probably will not come back here again.",3,2019,10,22
243,Great hotel. Friendly people,Loved this hotel. Especially the bed was really big and awesome. Nice and modern facilities . The breakfast was nice. They have really good coffee at the bar. The burger is also good. The temple bar is a10 minutes walk,5,2019,10,22
243,No Frills. Well Located.,"Upon arrival at around 10am, check in could not have been any easier or any more pleasant. There are several machines in the lobby for checking in (or out). The only piece of advice missing (that was kindly pointed out to us from the barista in the coffee stand) was that the key cards need activating by taking them to one of the staff members at reception! So be warned or you will head straight to your room and not be able to get in.

Well actually, you'd get stuck in the lift because you actually need to use your activated room key to be able to get the lift to work (going up only).

We had a Cosy King room which i believe is the standard room. The room was small (and cosy as described) with a super king bed, storage under the bed, a desk with one chair and three coat hangers. the bathroom was small but had a shower, toilet and sink. So it had everything you would need (if like us the room was just for sleeping in, showering and changing in etc.). The room had a smart TV of decent size but the picture occasionally dropped in and out. The shower isn't a full cubicle. it is one of those with a piece of glass that covers half the shower so for those that like a long soak in the shower prepare for a very wet floor/shower mat. There is also a safe in the room, but no advice anywhere to be found to advise what the default code is to unlock and reset the code!!

There is a bar/restaurant downstairs that seemed to offer a decent choice at relatively good prices.

We stopped in room 160 which given our abysmal view out of the window (of what looked like an almost derelict building) I gather is above the restaurant/bar and the terrace outside it. both my wife and i were either awoken or kept awake on several occasions on both of the nights we stayed at the hotel by what can be described as the sound of people dragging furniture across the floor. I cannot be clear if this was definitely as a result of the restaurant/bar below or was something else but it was my only real frustration for the whole trip. 

Check out was easy and the hotel are more than happy to look after bags for those whose flights / departure are later than the 11am check out time.

Very well priced hotel, lovely modern features, lovely staff. just one or two little gripes but it may be that i am too picky?!?",4,2019,10,22
243,Great place,"Is a fantastic hotel,in a very good location,amazing staff!!!
Rooms are confortable and clean, the hotel is very central and staff is super helpfull 
I recommend this place to anyone travelling to dublin ",5,2019,10,22
243,"Very kind staff, clean & newly opened Hotel in Dublin","I hope the Hotel maintains the clean housekeeping. 

Breakfast, Dinner time hotel resident guests should receive priority. First morning for Breakfast I had to wait; 2nd night dinner I was told to come before 7 pm & no reservations . Luckily there are many restaurants in the neighborhood so all it meant was to dress up in winter clothes & go out to eat with an umbrella. 

Everything was good, Andy in the Front Desk / Entrance was always there & very helpful so that was a pleasure. 

",4,2019,10,22
243,Really nice hotel,"This hotel is nice and I would choose it again if I were to go to Dublin. It´s fairly new, has a modern style with cosy sofas where you can sit dow in the lobby and tables and chairs. The staff was very friendly and best of all, the room was ready when we arrived around noon. The room itself was small, no wardrope and the bed was only accecable from one side which was not so good. The bathroom was also small but the shower space was not that small. My first impression was that this was not going to be a nice room to stay in for 4 nights but I was wrong. It was ok. There is a safe in the room but no coffe maker, kettle or fridge. The breakfast was nice, plenty of food to choose from. The coffee from the machine was not good but you could get a decent coffee at the bar. The location was ideal, short distances to everything.",4,2019,10,22
243,Excellent,"Lovely,central with good parking adjacent.A group of us had dinner ,we were pleasantly surprised by the quality of food and the choices to be had and would eat there again.Breakfast was excellent,interesting .",5,2019,10,22
243,"Excellent location, modern","We had an upgraded room so a little larger than the standard. Plenty of storage space, light & airy, bathroom lovely with good toiletries, fluffy towels. Bed was comfy too. Andy who was the concierge great chap. Very friendly and helpful. Recommended some restaurants & bars, nothing was too much, even took the time to show us to the end of the road where to go. Breakfast was all self service which was great, plenty of choice, very clean. Whilst only one coffee machine I asked the waiting staff if we could have coffees from the bar and again this was no trouble. Great location as only a short walk to St Stephens for the Big Bus co for the hop on hop off tours. Would recommend staying here, lovely!",5,2019,10,21
243,What a civilized place to stay!  location! bed comfort! room organization (executive)! shower! employee helpfullness!,"Well, the title says it all really.  I recommend this be your splurge hotel and book an executive room so you have room!  Bed is divine, pillows, covers, towels, all first rate.  Everyone from the person who helped me customize my reservation after a discount booking to the front desk person helping me with city tour and the vending machine to the concierge at the front door helping with restaurants and transportation.  Then barista on our departure was way cool with the extra hot coffee request.  The pleasure is in the details :))))",5,2019,10,21
243,Great hotel,"Modern hotel with lots of really nice touches. Nice decor and feel. It even has a little photo booth, which was fun. The location is very central.
Great breakfast. Super friendly and helpful staff.
Lovely hotel, would thoroughly recommend it!",5,2019,10,21
243,Fantastic location but service hit n miss,"What a fantastic location - this hotel is located within walking distance of the shops, theatres, attractions and LUAS. Self check in print out ink was too faint for us to make out the room number. We popped over to the reception desk to ask them to confirm and we were IGNORED by all THREE members of staff there! as they chatted to each other! We eventually figured out the room number ourselves and found the room to be nice and clean but very tiny. We knew this when we booked and it was fine for one night. Unfortunately the TV doesn't swivle so if you want to watch it you have to sit on the bed! design fault #1. the shower door doesn't close so the water spills out on the floor (design fault #2). #3 no space for bags. more hooks would be good.#4 the bed is shoved up against each corner of the wall but then they have leather covered foam surrounding it. Husband is 6'4"" and found almost didn't fit.  #5 the rooms are so well insulated that we had to have the air con on all night - in Ireland!!! the view from the room was of the flats where we saw some youngsters having a scrap!!! great for Dublin tourism. Breakfast was good but ONE self service coffee machine????? they really need a second at least. Husband used the downstairs loos and they were extremely dirty. In summary the location is the big win for this hotel. The design is very 'on trend'. Don't go for the service. We saw people eating take-away in the lobby which i guess means they don't the bother of F&B.",3,2019,10,21
243,2 night business stay,"Self check in didn't work but there was a receptionist on hand to o it the old fashioned way. The hotel is in a great central location within easy walk of bars, restaurants, shops etc. Small room with a massive bed and big TV. Although no wardrobe and very little storage. Only 3 hangars on the wall, which for a 3 day business trip only just covers the essentials. No iron or board in the room. Very dingy ironing room in what appeared to be an electrical switch room. This could do with some hanger points or a table of some kind to hang / place ironed items as there was nowhere to put things once ironed.
Bathroom was good size with a good powerful shower.
No fridge in the room so had to use the old supermarket bag of ice in the bathroom sink for the beer.
My room was quite overlooked by an office block opposite. The electrically operated blackout blinds took a little finding (2 switches by the bed) but provided privacy.
Breakfast was high quality and checkout straightforward.",4,2019,10,19
243,Such a delightful stay!,"So, the Marlin is where the old Mercer used to be, across from the TravelLodge. Walk nearly everywhere, including only 5 minutes to Trinity College! It has only been opened 7 weeks, so everything is pristinely clean. Note: this is a ""no frills"" hotel, but a few notches up from a Moxy. The king sized bed goes from wall to wall. There is a desk/chair, 3 hangers on the wall, a safe, and a shower, sink and toilet, with ample counter space. Breakfast had many choice selections for a full Irish breakfast, fresh fruits, various cereals and breads, breakfast sweets. Add to that, salmon, fish and cheeses/salamis. There is a coffee machine where you can choose the type of coffee and the beans are ground per cup. It was quiet, relaxing, and the staff were both attentive and friendly. The only thing that was a mishap was that the electricity went out, probably because all 8 rooms on our floor were charging electronics simultaneously! It was fixed straight away. I stayed 2 nights and could have stayed a month.",5,2019,10,17
243,Wonderful ,"Amazing location, a short walk to Grafton street and right beside St Stephens Green shopping centre. 

(Parking available inside St Stephens Green for those who have a car during the visit)

Room was very comfortable with necessities covered. 

Self service check in and out available and very quick and easy to follow. 

Hotel lobby and bar/ restaurant area modern and comfortable, suitable for causal business meetings too. 

Would highly recommend ",5,2019,10,17
243,"New Hotel, Great Hotel","New four stars hotel with very good quality, strategic location in the city of Dublin, very polite and helpful service, bar and dining areas are very comfortable too.It's just that there are no coffee and tea facilities in the room. but that's not a problem, hopefully management will facilitate it later.   I recommend this hotel.",5,2019,10,15
243,Great Hotel,"Great place with nice facilities. Outdoor seating and spreadout lobby.
Buffer breakfast was excellent.
Very friendly reception and accomodating personel.
Room was small but everything was in excellent shape",5,2019,10,15
243,stayed for 8 night,"Overall i was very satisfied. Regardless, i have somethings i would mention:
- i would be great to have small reading lamps. With ceiling light only it was either very dark or sunshine everywhere. A bit of less light would be very nice to have.
- The bathroom glass doors could have some closure damping, because they are a bit too loud.
- The motion detector in the bathroom is cool, but it could be with a larger timing period. Or switched of when the main lamp is on. It's annoying a bit, to hear the sound click, every second, when you are showering or using the toilet.

Overall, it is a very nice hotel :) 
- Cool comfortable bed
- Large enough desk with chair
- Hairdresser
- Cleanness
- Very fast elevator",4,2019,10,15
243,partners birthday weekend!,"Stayed with my partner and her family. The hotel was perfect for us. Great location, rooms were cosy and clean. Service was good and even provided a birthday welcome gift for my partner. Will stay again.",5,2019,10,14
243,Modern and clean,"Nice and clean hotel newly opened in August 2019! We could't wait for our stay at this new hotel. It was the newest hotel we have ever stayed at. Less than 2 months old when we checked in! And it didn't disappoint!
Every corner had modern furnishings, some areas coupled with semi-retro touches such as a funky-coloured vespa and a cute phonebooth at the lobby!
The most basic room had a huge bed, definitely wider than a king-sized bed. Loads of space horizontally on the bed but not vertically (the ends were literally wall-to-wall), but yeah, the width well compensated for that. 
Blinds were ultra-modern, controlled by a bedside switch, and effectively blocks sunshine just when you need darkness in the room.
Water heating was functioning well, no frustrating timed heaters (think: cold water flowing right after applying shampoo). 
Breakfast was on the pricey side and we were lured by the myriad of choices for breakfast around the area, so we can't comment. 
We also loved the location. Set in a relatively quiet area of Dublin, yet a stone's throw away from the main attractions and shopping centre. 
Downside: 
1) No refrigerator in the room. Can't store any milk/yogurt/cold beers :(
2) Glass door of the bathroom repels strongly when opened, and the gap between the lower edge of the door and the floor inconveniently happens to be slightly narrower than the thickness of a big toe. So yeah, I was injured. Worse than stepping on a Lego brick, eh.
3) Wifi doesn't always work, especially on an iPhone, but worked well on Androids.",4,2019,10,13
243,Disappointed is an understatement,"Currently stayed in hotel on Tuesday night. Used auto check in. 2 females came into hotel unannounced because of kiosk machine fault meaning room was double booked, no apologies made whatsoever. Then card got deactivated. Sink didn’t work. Bluetooth didn’t work, and chrome cast website didn’t work. I paid 170€ for this. People were lovely and beds were indeed lovely.",2,2019,10,12
243,"Funky, Modern & New","The Marlin is the newest hotel on the Dublin scene, located right in the heart of the city centre behind St. Stephen’s Green Shopping Centre.

The hotel is so quirky, modern and funky with a colourful and inviting lobby which is also home to a caravan which serves coffee. There is no real reception area per se (there is one desk) but most guests check-in using an online station just inside the main door.

The staff are friendly and polite and just off the lobby, you will find the bar and restaurant which I didn’t use due to limited time. 

The rooms in the Marlin are designed to have everything you need in a compact space. The beds are lovely and comfortable- they measure 2 metres x 2 metres and are designed that you can sleep at any angle. Come with all the usual amenities including Tv, phone, complimentary water, toiletries and safe. The bathroom was a little bit on the tiny side, reminded me of a bathroom in a ship cabin. We stayed in room 159; the room was small but no smaller than any hotel room in the major cities in continental Europe. It was so clean and still had that ‘new room’ smell which was lovely.

Check-out time is a little earlier than standard, 11am which at the time didn’t bother me as I was up early anyway.

Location could not get any better so overall very enjoyable and absolutely perfect for a city break in Dublin. I do think that if you were to stay longer than 2 nights though, it might start to feel a bit cramped given the size of the rooms but highly recommended nonetheless.

Wishing them all the best! ",4,2019,10,10
243,What a surprise,Such a cool hotel.  Booked at the last minute as the accommodation I had previously booked had to cancel on me.  I will definitely stay at the Marlin Hotel again. Couldn't recommend it more highly.  Beds are HUGE too! ,5,2019,10,10
243,"Lovely hotel, great location.",We had a great time. The hotel is cute and quirky. The staff were helpful and the room had a touch of luxury to them. It's a good place to go as a treat and is close to lots of sights in Dublin and near to the shops. ,5,2019,10,09
243,Location is perfect,"We flew to Dublin and had booked the Marlin hotel through our travel agent.  At the time it was just opening in August so very new and no reviews.  I think the room we had should have been for 1 person as the bed is surrounded by 3 walls, no closet, just 3 hangers on a wall and little space.  That being said, the bed was extremely comfortable and the room was very clean. The thing about this hotel is you can walk to everything as it is in the middle of everything.  Now for the staff, everyone is amazing.  The people that stand out was of course Brian.  He helped us with everything...planned trips, great advice, restaurants and places to go and see, even gave us a recommendation for a wonderful birthday dinner. He was also happy and welcoming.  Also Natalia, hope this is right.  She chatted with us, gave us lots of info and very happy and cheerful, and although we didnt have much contact with him...Andy, cheerful and always smiling.  The staff here go over the top to make your stay amazing.  Will definitely go back just book a bigger room for us",5,2019,10,08
243,"Mostly good, with a bit of sour","Stayed for 3 nights and 4 days.

Rooms are pretty small, I guess that is a concept or an idea of theirs.

No iron, you have to go to an ironing room 
(With no water) 

Gym had no water.

Their issue solving urgency is not good. I had an issue with the room air conditioner and they took some time to fix, so they gave me new room. On new room safe was not working and I was asking for a solution and the not kind at all assistant manager was awfull. Did not behave properly and did not provide a solution. What is worst about this is that this hotel was not cheap and they did noy keep up on attentions with their price. So in some way it was lost money.

The guy at the bar, very kind. Anna from front desk, excellent service. Assistant manager damaged the whole stay on my opinion.

For some reason you cant put things on your room open check in, you have to go back to the front desk and open a new ""tab"" or folio with your card. Thats basic for me.

Goods: bar was nice. Breakfast was average. Bed was comfortable.

Would not use this hotel at a different location.",2,2019,10,07
243,"Very good hotel, very helpful and pleasant staff","Lovely stay in Dublin. Cozy new hotel, very good breakfast. Extremely central. The rooms are not huge but they are perfectly fine for a ew nights. The bed is amazing. Accommodating staff, I would stay there again. ",5,2019,10,07
243,Air conditioning overheated! No sleep!!!,"Hotel is pleasant, bar area and ground floor is nice and quite and good for working (if you’re there on business) Room is clean and bed appears comfortable, however, that’s where it ended for me.

Complained twice when I returned to my room (22.30) about dodgy air conditioning unit venting extremely hot air. Room became a furnace and with no window to open it was impossible to let cool air in. I complained twice and nothing happened. First time I was told to wait 20 mins and it would change... nothing.. second time I was told the manager would be notified and call me.. no call. The whole unit was off and I had to open the door to let air into the room and at around midnight this is ridiculous, I had an early start the next day - I attempted sleep but woke up lots of times as I was too hot! 

Reported the problem the next day and was given opportunity to speak to a manager, I’ve written two emails and nobody had bothered to respond. Awful customer service and not worth a penny for hardly any sleep. 

You should be ashamed. Treat people with some respect, courtesy and get back to them.",1,2019,10,07
243,5 star,Beds are super comfy and very big. Shower is lovely with a choice of rainfall shower head. All staff are really kind and very helpful. Food is lovely and nice atmosphere in the bar. Location is a bonus. ,5,2019,10,06
243,Weekend visit,"We found the hotel to be clean, friendly and perfect for our weekend, except that it was rather expensive for there to be no tea/coffee making facilities in the room and no breakfast included. Location is great though.",4,2019,10,06
243,Lovely hitel,"I booked this sight unseen and so glad I did 
Clean beautiful, nice helpful people at the desk, concierge incredibly helpful
Rooms are compact but very nice 
Bed was so very comfortable 
Breakfast is wonderful here be sure to included time for it
Close enough to walk to most anything without being exhausted
Restaurant is limited for dinner but very good",5,2019,10,05
243,Lovely hotel,"Stayed here yesterday and I loved the hotel. The decorative features are lovely. Check in very easy, you can choose whether you want to go to the reception or check in via self service which is super easy to use. Great place to stay if you are here on business like I was. The room itself was simply Devine. The bed was so comfy - which you don’t often find when you’re away from home! Room is super dark (perfect for a nap after a long day of travelling) breakfast I would say over priced however it was nice and the staff lovely!",5,2019,10,04
243,Great stay,"Had a great trip, hotel was very hip and modern. Had everything you could ask for. Bar, a business lounge, restaurant and gym. The deluxe room was a great size and really exceeded my expectations. Staff were friendly and nice. The location couldn’t have been more central. A five minute walk to grafton greet and to the temple bar. ",5,2019,10,04
243,Ideal stay for work trip.,I was well attended to by staff throughout my stay at the Marlin Hotel. The room was very clean and the bed was very comfortable. Breakfast was also great. Very conveniently located for walking around central Dublin. ,4,2019,10,04
243,"Modern, stylish hotel in the heart of Dublin",This a brand new modern and stylish hotel in the heart of Dublin. The room I stayed in is a pod type one. It is compact but has nearly everything you need except tea/coffee making facilitates which be a nice added touch. Bottle water however is supplied free of charge. The TV has Chromecast which is great for stream Netflix etc. if you are regular visitor like me. Generally room are very clean but sometimes there are bits missed which are highlighted by its newness - however when I report any issues to staff they are rectified quickly. Nice bar and the food is good and reasonably priced. Gym too but not used that yet. I stay here weekly so and will continue to do so.   ,4,2019,10,04
243,Great Customer Service!,"Our stay was fantastic! Quiet, comfortable, great location and helpful staff. They even helped us arrange a taxi transfer to the airport with a infant carseat. To top it all off, they also packed us a breakfast that included by baby's favorite fruit. All done with a smile. I would totally stay there again!",5,2019,10,03
243,"Great hotel, very stylish, but could be even better","The Marlin is in a great location. Very central, but just away from the really busy areas so noise from outside is not an issue. Only a few minutes walk from many of Dublin’s attractions. It is new, so the rooms are still very clean and well presented. We had a cosy king room. The bed is enormous and extremely comfortable ( feel sorry for cleaning staff as changing sheets must be a night mare as it has walls on 3 sides) , tv is large and loads of functions, shower is powerful. 
However, no storage apart from 3 hooks and a large drawer under the bed, no tea and coffee making facilities, no iron ( there is a room down the hall) , lighting is limited to all in or all off! The only subtle lighting is if you put the bathroom lighting on and leave main bedroom off. In the bathroom there  is a low level light set off by motion sensor, this a great idea. 
Breakfast was generally good, although some of the hot plates to keep the buffet food warm weren’t that hot. 
Staff all very polite and helpful. 
So all in all, pretty good value for Dublin, but a little bit “ basic” in terms of the bedroom. ",4,2019,10,03
243,WONDERFUL STAFF STANDARD ROOMS TOO SMALL FOR COMFORT,"This is a very hip, wonderfully located hotel. The reception, supervisory and dining staff are wonderful; professional and friendly. Very well trained.

The standard rooms are ridiculously small. Totally unsuitable for a couple. The bed is built into the room with only one side open. We asked to be upgraded and were accommodated but the only room available was a handicap access room. That was fine.

We had problems every day with housekeeping. They simply didn't completely clean our room or bath. Changed towels and made the bed, but didn't clean sinks, shower or toilet. One day they didn't show up at all and when the night staff sent someone, they didn't finish the job. Seems very odd for a hotel with such exceptional staff everyplace else.",4,2019,10,01
243,Brill new hotel ,"We stopped here at the weekend, we loved  Dublin and the hotel was brill! From the big comfy bed, great rainfall shower and lovely breakfast with a baileys coffee, the rooms aren’t the biggest but that’s city living for you. there was plenty of pubs and bars nearby and We will definitely stay here again next time we return to Dublin. ",4,2019,10,01
243,"Great hotel, great location","The hotel is brand new and they thought of everything. Loved that there are USB hubs to charge my cell phones (i forgot my converter) and this was by far the comfiest beds. It was a great, super central location and everything was walking distance. The only issue with the hotel is the parking! Soooo expensive! We paid 35€ for two nights and that was AFTER the “discount” the hotel gave us. Fix that and you will be a 5-star place. ",4,2019,10,01
243,Excellent hotel,"This new hotel opened 2 weeks prior to my arrival. Staff is excellent, providing assistance in every way.  Even free washer and dryers on the lower level if you need them!  Hotel is conveniently located near Grafton street.  Excellent meals in the onsite restaurant/bar!",5,2019,09,30
243,Impressive new hotel,"Booked the Marlin for our first visit to Dublin. From checking in to leaving the customer service was exceptional, really can't fault the staff.

As with most new hotels you'd expect teething troubles but there really weren't that many to mention. While probably my only issue was lack of tea/coffee facilities in the room, along with  alack of storage space or the use of an iron in the room, everything else was perfect.

A lot of effort placed on the design, slightly missed the mark when it came to storage but I am sure tea/coffee and an iron could easily be sorted. Nowhere to put a large suitcase within the room we stayed in (King Room).

If you don't mind living out of your case and walking to the ""Ironing Room"" then this hotel is for you.",5,2019,09,30
243,You couldn't get more central!!!,"Stumbled across this really cool hotel by accident.  I got a ""Pigsback"" deal & thought sure it seems to be central enough & it's a new hotel so it ""will do"" for 1 night.  What a FANTASTIC surprise I got when we parked our car in the College of Surgeons Carpark, walked out the pedestrian entrance & there it was ""The Marlin"".  I've worked in some of the ""CoWorking"" places around Dublin & this place reminds me of them - cool, hip, trendy, welcoming, interesting & a little bit different.  While the rooms are pretty standard hotel type accommodation - bed (very comfortable), tv, tea/coffee making facilities, decent shower (toiletries provided), a/c etc....the lobby, coworking space, dining area, chillout area & bar are beyond funky & different.  If we were staying 2 nights we would have happily hung out in the hotel for the afternoon.  Self Check In, Self Check Out, a nice Gym.  Record players with LPs, lots of books to peruse while chilling in the many & varied seating areas or by the open fire.  For anyone looking for a cool spot in a fantastically central location (pretty much beside the Gaiety, a 2 minute walk from St Stephen's Green, Grafton Street & numerous cool bars & restaurants) this is the place to stay.",5,2019,09,30
243,Fantastic,"It was great to stay in this brand new & modern hotel ,I booked it during the summer in advance of it opening and thankfully it lived up to high expectations.
Very stylish and appealing and all the staff go out of their way to make your stay as comfortable as possible ,very professional and attentive ,and very friendly and welcoming. Love the Marlin!",5,2019,09,29
243,"Comfortable room, huge bed, good breakfast","Had 1 night in Dublin for work and someone recommended I give this hotel a try.  That was some good advice.  Hotel is brilliantly located behind St Stephens shopping centre, 2 minutes walk to Grafton Street.

As a new hotel, it does have a few issues that need to be fixed - you're expected to check in via an iPad but that didn't work and I couldn't figure out how to turn off the air conditioner.  Plus you have just a couple of hangers for your clothes but as I was only there for 1 night, could put up with it.

Room was small but again not an issue for 1 night.  My room was opposite the accountant office next door and you need to make sure the curtain is drawn as it is very near.  But bed is huge and comfortable, it is a nice treat having the TV at the foot of the bed, shower is big and powerful and while compact, the room works well.

Had breakfast the next morning which is a well stocked hot and cold buffet.  Had everything I would ever want - a test is always quality of the sausages and they were very good here.  Also as an exile in London, always a treat getting white pudding.

Room rate was pretty reasonable given location and quality of hotel.  I will be coming back when I'm on business trips.",4,2019,09,29
243,"Small, noisy and no 24 hour food ","1) rooms far to small for 150 euro + per night 
2) rooms very noisy with cleaners talking loudly from 8
3) no food past 9pm
4) no room service 
5) for a 4* Hotel this has to be the worst hotel I've stayed at for facilities and amenities 
",2,2019,09,29
243,Quaint! ,"Loved the Marlin! Excellent service, fun café & even better bar. Rooms very nice & accommodating. AC works wonderfully well. Even has an ironing room! An excellent several days stay! Definitely recommend the location too. Close to all (walking distance)! ",5,2019,09,28
243,Trendy Hotel in Heart of Dublin,"Brand new and very trendy hotel close to everything in Dublin!  New staff is still working through the fine details but are trying hard to please their guests.  Warning for older travelers, the rooms are designed narrow and give you the experience of being on a ship cabin, so no room to walk around the beds as the bed crossed our narrow room!  He breakfast buffet was very good with lots of choices.  The concierge gave us some great suggestions for restaurants and things to do, very helpful!  Only negative for us was that we had no control of our rooms temperature and it did get cold at night.  Overall, we enjoyed our stay and will not hesitate to return.",4,2019,09,27
243,Avoid if staying for 3 night or more,"I stayed at the Marlin in September 2019 for five nights. The hotel was opened about a month earlier, according to staff. I agree with other reviewers that the beds are good. Storage or hanging options for your clothes, at least in king rooms, are extremely limited: 3 coat hangers and 3 open shelves. My room would have accommodated a wardrobe,, but there was no such thing. The bathroom also is a triumph of form over function. 1 hook in total to hang towels or clothes. This room is also used for two people???? Wash basin and tap badly designed, so will spray your items on the “wrong” side. 

Website was still 1/2 functional: I expressed my complaints and some suggestions to the address listed for the manager (and info@marlin...), but only received an automated reply that the address for the manager did not exist. 
Also had to have my entry card reprogrammed three times, two in immediate succession, in five nights...

Great location, but king rooms are just too inconvenient for long-ish stays or if you must have a kettle in your room.",3,2019,09,26
243,Great stay at the Marlin,"The room was very comfortable and quiet with good temperature controls so had a great night sleep!! Also loved the lobby area... comfortable seating areas with small library, coffee hub with a long table, also an internet working zone...",5,2019,09,26
243,Great night sleep ... missing some features ,"First the positives I had a great nights sleep in this hotel. The room has electric blackout blinds, a huge bed and great bed linen. Staff are also v friendly. 

The room is pretty small so I wouldn’t spend more than a night or two as it may get a little claustrophobic. 

I stay in Dublin a lot for work and while the location is perfect I missed having a kettle/ tea facilities so I probably won’t stay again for that reason. Also need to go to a special room to iron clothes which isn’t ideal first thing in the morning before you are dressed. ",3,2019,09,25
243,Weekend Away,"When we arrived at the Marlin Hotel, we were blown away with how funky and spacious the hotel was, We were met by Marc the Concierge who was fabulous.  When we got to our room we found that there was no tea or coffee making facilities, now to me that is a major fail when you have been travelling for so long and you are in need of a cuppa.(Also when you have to be up at 02.30 for a flight it is nice to have one before you leave), The cleaners then decided at 15.45 to clean the room to me that should be done in the morning not the afternoon, we declined as we needed to get ready to go out, we asked for more Toilet Rolls but unfortunately the cleaner spoke no English and did not understand and walked off, 
We were told that breakfast was £13.00 on the checking in form but when we arrived for breakfast on the Sunday Morning we were charged 33.00 Euros which to me was alot of money (16.50 euros each), 

We asked the hotel to arrange a Taxi for us from the hotel and take us to the Airport , when we asked for a price we were told no more than 30 Euro's, Arrived at the airport and was charged  46 euro's consdering he told us he was the regular driver for the hotel, this to me seems like he is ripping the Hotel Guests off, so maybe we can suggest you get some set in stone prices ! 

Overall we did enjoy the hotel, but we will not be back unless you have facilities in your room.

",4,2019,09,25
243,We Loved the Marlin!,"We spent a few packed Dublin days at the Marlin, and the stay was awesome.  The staff is very accommodating (concierge Brian goes above and beyond), friendly, and helpful.  The rooms are very comfortable and nicely decorated.  We would definitely stay at the Marlin again should we travel back to Dublin.  ",5,2019,09,23
243,Top for business travel,"small rooms, but absolutely sufficient for biz travel or sight seeing weekend. the bed was perfect and the place in the centre of city perfect! I would recommend this hotel and will definetely book for my next Dublin visit.",5,2019,09,23
243,Marvelous Marlin.,I had the pleasure of staying in the Marlin Hotel for one night recently and can honestly say that I loved everything about my stay. I always park in the Stephen’s Green Shopping Centre Car Park whenever I drive to Dublin and the location of the hotel directly across from the exit from the car park is ideal. The twin beds in our room were so comfortable and I had a terrific nights sleep and loved the Anyah Eco toiletries in the bathroom. We didn’t have dinner in the hotel as we were attending a graduation celebratory dinner but had a delicious and satisfying breakfast the next day. I loved the decor and “vibe” in the hotel foyer and garden bar and always have a coffee from the horse box coffee station whenever I am “in town” and hope to stay there again soon.,5,2019,09,23
243,A perfect stay,"We have had a beyond lovely experience staying at the Marlin. The staff has been so welcoming and helpful. The hotel is brand spankin new and very well thought out. We love the vibe and the coziness of our room. Walking distance to almost all the big attractions, shopping, eating, and nightlife. I would recommend the Marlin to anyone. ",5,2019,09,22
243,Perfect hotel for a Dublin visit!,"The Marlin is lovely, modern and comfortable, and it is perfectly located for a Dublin tourist. The rooms are spotless and snug, yet sleekly efficient. Great beds! I slept so soundly. Loved the main lobby area, where you can just go sit and grab a cup of tea or a drink in a variety of differently decorated areas including an indoor garden room with a fireplace. It lives up to its webpage. Staff was eager to help and very friendly. A couple of minutes to pubs, shopping, or a bench in St. Stephens Green.  The Marlin is my official Dublin hotel! ",5,2019,09,22
243,RCSI parents,"Perfect location for overseas parents doing the drop off for RCSI students. Close to dorm ,RCSI and very importantly , Dunne’s department store. Staff were very helpful and ready to meet any guest’s needs. Morning papers and in-house restaurant were appreciated after long days. Great jump off point for seeing Dublin and Ireland as well. We will definitely be returning to the Marlin, sooner than graduation day!

243,Beautiful hotel,"We took a last minute stay, from 1st walking into the hotel it was a beautiful surpise.   the location is excellent.  Just where we wanted to be. Shops, Bars, theatre & restaurant , will definitely be back.. 🤗",5,2019,09,21
243,Great Hotel - Will stay again,"Had a lovely stay in the Marlin hotel with my husband last weekend. It was our first visit but it certainly won’t be our last. It is in a superb location only a few mins from Grafton St. The staff were all welcoming and helpful. The hotel itself is so different with lots of quirky features.  
The room had a big comfy bed and air con which was a bonus on a warm night. Breakfast was delicious with plenty of choice. We’re looking forward to a return visit soon",5,2019,09,19
243,4 nights in Ireland,"Marlin hotel was a great choice - location as well as price. The staff were very helpful in throwing a small birthday welcome, thank you! The bed was so big and comfortable. Room was quiet, clean  and spacious enough for 4 nights. On the down side - hotel is brand new so some adjustments are still going on. Shower has only half door and the water splash everywhere. Automatic light under sink (good for night needs) keeps turning on while in shower and toilet, even when not needed, while making clicking sounds. My friends' safe didn't work properly even after front desk assistance. The storage in room is good for solo traveler but a couple needs more space. Only 3 hangers in room. On my third night, after having dinner every night at the hotel restaurant I was charged 2euro for a glass of tap water, odd. Again, great choice for short and compact stay, I definitely recommend it and would love to visit again.",4,2019,09,19
243,"Marlin Hotel, Dublin","This new hotel is conveniently located to the hop on/hop off bus and many Dublin attractions.  The service was excellent and we received great suggestions for restaurants.  The breakfast was also good, so you should take the rate that includes breakfast! We had an executive King which was great.  Other people in our group had the smaller room and were not as happy.  Great beds, black out drapes, very quiet-all made for a great night's sleep.",5,2019,09,19
243,Great Hotel.  Delightful staff.  Gorgeous breakfast,"Highly recommend this Hotel.  Great addition to Dublin. Superb location.

 We stayed there on Saturday night and we had a great time in the Hotel.  The staff at check in were extremely friendly and helpful.  We were a little early but the staff spoke to Housekeeping and they got the rooms for us within 10 mins. 

The room itself was lovely.  The air conditioning was a great bonus as it was warm that weekend.  The bed was big and so comfy. The bathroom spotless! 

We went to the bar which was big and airy with plenty of room and the bonus of polite and friendly staff.

The breakfast the next morning was a surprise!  We were very impressed with the standard and variety of food.  The staff were delightful.  The service was fast and efficient for coffees etc.

We asked for a late check out and it was no problem at all.  Checkout was fast and we left our bags there to be minded while we went for a walk in Stephens Green.

The QPark was great as the entrance was right across the road and we availed of your discount for parking. 

Overall a lovely experience.

243,Will stay again!,"What a Great hotel, we where greeted by friendly staff and an amazing ambience to begin with,the rooms are clean and modern and the smart tv is a bonus, the breakfast was great with plenty of options, 2 minute walk to Grafton street and lots of Nice restaurants, this will definitely be my hotel of choice in Dublin going forward.",5,2019,09,19
243,Great location.,"I spent 3 nights in this hotel. The breakfast was good, and the location is great. However during my stay there was no housekeeping offered to my room. Only on the last day and at 7pm, the room service personnel knocked at my door to ask me if I want my room to be made. When I told him that no one did any housekeeping during my stay, he said to me that they had a problem with the staff, and the housekeeping team has left the hotel and a new team has been in charged since few days and they are a bit overwhelmed. He apologized and offered me a set of towels.",4,2019,09,19
243,Great Stay,"Had a nice stay, staff were super friendly and helpful. Would definitely stay again. Reception cafe was very handy, lots of seating. Chromecast TV addition was a nice touch for netflix etc. Location is great, everything needed is within walking distance.",5,2019,09,19
243,"Coffee, Pasterie and staff best in Dublin!","Droped by the Marlin Hotel for a an early morning coffee with my wife before work as we had watched it being built from the first JCB on site and were curious about its ambience.We were very surprised at its specious and relaxing atmosphere with so many areas to relax, compute, meet or fulfill any activity for business or leisure. We had intended to have a quick coffee and back to the grindstone of daily life:) We spoke to Gavin and enquired if we could have the coffee in the breakfast area and he proceeded to show us all the facilities and we had the best coffee and patisseries in town and very good value too. Gavin and the staff weren't  just professional they were genuinely pleasant people. Enjoyed our start to our day, thank you.",5,2019,09,18
243,Marlin Hotel,"Had my first visit to the Marlin hotel last weekend. Had drinks and a bite to eat with friends, must say the surroundings were exquisite and the food and staff in all departments were lovely also, would highly recommend a visit to anyone.",5,2019,09,17
243,Just nope,Just book an Ibis. I don't think you'll find a pricier more basic hotel in Dublin. Like they give basic a bad name. Just no.No kettle. No cleaning your entire stay. Is the bed the width of the room or is the room the width of your bed? My room window overlooked... the corridor. Sweet lord.,1,2019,09,16
243,A Hotel with Potential But Poorly Managed,"Despite calling from the airport to request early check-in and being told we could, we arrived at 2 and could not get in. Ok, fair enough—early check-in is a privilege and things happen. We saw the check-in time of 3 pass. Then 4. They said a few more minutes, put us in the bar and gave us free drinks. We needed rest in our rooms. Finally shortly after 5 we got in. We had to cancel our evening plans.  
  It is a new hotel, and the rooms seemingly had not been inspected. My tv did not work. Nor the hot water in the shower. They did move me to a suite the next day. Some outlets didn’t work there. 
  The staff was friendly and upbeat. Management did make an accommodation on our bill, but it didn’t compensate for a bad start to our holiday.",2,2019,09,16
243,Attractive new hotel in perfect location,"We stayed 6 nights at the Marlin hotel, which opened just two weeks ago. It seems designed to attract the younger professional clientele with its funky futuristic decor and design and many computer stations  around a large lobby area. You are greeted with an island checkin with 4 terminals. We ended up at the small counter to get help with our credit card payment. The staff is extremely friendly, courteous and helpful. The three elevators were very efficient and the voice sounds like you’re getting on a space ship! Our room was a small cubical room with a huge raised full width bed which was very comfortable with quite a heavy duvet and thick pillows on it.  You can only see the tv if you’re in the bed. Under the bed is one large drawer. There is a small desk and chair and safe but no fridge or coffee maker. The rain head or wand shower provided instant hot water.  The quality of hallway carpet and room cleaning was sub par and we had to call three days when our room wasn’t cleaned or empty Kleenex not replaced. Being a brand new hotel might just mean there are a few kinks to iron out yet. The room was very sound proof. The breakfast buffet looked amazing though we never used it ourselves. This hotel is in an excellent location, being just 3 minutes from a large shopping center with a full grocery store and next to a main pedestrian shopping area with restaurants, pubs and numerous street buskers. The Dublin Aircoach or 757 airport bus are just a 7 minutes walk away.   ",4,2019,09,13
243,Enjoyable stay,"We booked this hotel last minute and from check in to check out the staff were excellent.
The room although on the small side was very stylish with some great design features. The bathroom was bright with some lovely toilletries.  We had food in the restaurant which was well presented and good value.
This is a new hotel and is very close to Grafton Street with car parking just opposite in Q park.
I would stay her again.",5,2019,09,13
243,Brand New... Service  Lacking,"Two nights in the second week of September.  Notes:  Positive: Location is great. Front line staff was friendly. Negative:  IPAD app check in in process was really slow to register typing, clunky, and impersonal. Needs to be refined substantially.  IPAD check out process was clunky and at the end, the machine instructed me to see a clerk. I was unable to check out on a prepaid reservation.  Breakfast employees were nice but young manager was dictatorial in communication style to the other employees and to me and oddly impersonal in a nearly empty dining room. That is probably the best way to describe the hotel: ""Oddly Impersonal""  Unclear at first if it was a seat yourself arrangement( it was) but when I asked the check in employee if I should seat myself, she said yes, I found a table, the male manager then came over and asked me how many people I had in my party.  Not hello, or welcome, or please have a seat. Again, in a nearly empty dining room.  Another person had already checked my pre-paid breakfast status, so his purpose was unclear, when I answered, he said, ""that will be okay"" or something very close to that and walked away.  The dining room employees (both female) dutifully checked tables and picked up plates and the young male manager kept giving them abrupt command style instructions every few minutes such as ""_____ I need you to stand in this section"".  It was minor but irritating. In a room with six people in it, is is hard not to notice that kind of thing. Not sure how much of what I saw could be chalked up to youth or experience or how much might be an emerging personality disorder...I'm not  qualified to say.  But bring your DSMIV manual to breakfast if you decide to stay and form you own opinion.  Mostly quiet but staff was on a few loud in the hallways during the day.  At times it was hard to sleep off the jet lag.  My 7:30 am confirmed wake up call never happened....etc... When I told them they had missed my wake up call at checkout (after joining the queue to checkout with a human after  the IPAD failed to let me check out), she just looked at me and said nothing. For about $300 (and up) a night, the Marlin is not the most expensive new hotel in Dublin, but in terms of basic service value for your money, you can do much better elsewhere.They  have a lot of room to grow.  Were the rooms not brand new, I'd have rated this two stars at best. Really, Really disappointing",3,2019,09,13
243,STAFF TRIED TO OVERCHARGE ME,"This is a newly built hotel with decent rooms and facilities but more than just teething problems. The reception staff tried, deliberately or otherwise, to rip me off. I will be generous and put this down to computer problems at the hotel. Unbelievably, they tried to charge me for my stay twice after I had already paid! 
I was advised on arrival in the evening at the start of a four night stay to use the self-help kiosk to check in. The credit card machine attached to the terminal indicated my payment had gone through. A member of staff duly gave my room key. Then, another member of staff, the Duty Manager, claimed my payment had not gone through. Foolishly, I forgot to get a receipt off the card machine. 
As far as I was concerned, I told him, I had paid as indicated on the card payment machine with message approved. I refused to process my payment again & would double-check on my transaction with my bank. I was allowed up to the room only to receive a curt phone call from the manager re my alleged non-payment.  The next day I checked. I had paid. The payment had indeed gone through.
Just thought nothing more of it was and assumed it was some weird computer glitch at the hotel. Also decided to just ignore the curt behaviour and outright rudeness of the duty manager on arrival. It was the end of the evening and probably a long day for him.
Sadly, on check out, yet again the staff claimed I had not paid my room rate. I was asked to wait for the manager. As I did, a receptionist was demanding payment from other guests checking out, both insisting, like me, they had already paid.
Eventually, I dealt with the manager. She conceded on double checking I had paid on arrival. There was no apology for trying to get me to pay THREE times for my visit. This was just simply outrageous and unforgivable behaviour.",3,2019,09,10
243,New Hotel I like!,"I stayed two nights at this wonderful new hotel. It's actually directly in the heart of dublin, next to st. stephens green and grafton street. the rooms are very nice, especially the big bed was very comfortable. my room was very quite during night, i was sleeping very well. bathroom was very nice and clean, only the shower had not enough water pressure for me (but this problem I have all over the world, in nearly every hotel).

the staff (front desk, bar, service) is very friendly and helpful. there is also a very cosy lobby, where you see a lot of funny decoration. Usually I stayed in an other hotel in Dublin, but this one is really worth to come back!",5,2019,09,09
243,Enjoyed,"Stayed here for one night with my partner as we were attending a show in Vicar Street. I liked the self service check in. Two genuinely friendly staff members came to make sure we were OK as we were using it. The hotel looks beautiful. The room was a great size with a lovely, comfortable bed. There was a kettle in the room but no tea or coffee and the TV remote did not have batteries in it - a previous guest probably pinched them. The shower creaked an awful lot at every movement which was a bit daunting but it is a brand new hotel so it probably just needs to settle a bit. The air conditioning in the room was glorious. Breakfast was very nice. We will definitely stay again. ",4,2019,09,08
243,Perfect,"Love this hotel. They thought of everything. So efficient.  Very comfy bed. Nice shower. Even have drawer under bed with room for two carry on bags. 
Close walking distance to restaurants. I’d stay again and recommend to friends. ",5,2019,09,06
243,Bad Start for their Hotel and Our Trip,"I emailed the hotel when I found out about a change in our flight that would have us arriving early on our day of check in (today). Touching down in Dublin a week later, I’d had no response. So I called and spoke with someone who told me by the time we made it from airport to hotel our rooms should be ready. It took longer than expected and we were exhausted by the time we reached the hotel, at 2:30, just a half hour ahead of normal check in. A young man who spoke softly and swiftly approached me as I attempted the self check in. He took over and as best I could tell told me the rooms weren’t ready. Another man, Marc was helpful and took our luggage to a locked room for storage and pointed the way to a pub for a quick snack. We returned about 3:45 and the rooms still weren’t ready. We were ushered into the bar for a free drink — the last thing any of us wanted after almost 24 hours of traveling without stop. But what choice did we have? We sat in the bar another 30-40 minutes before my father grabbed a managerial type and after a few more minutes we were told our rooms across the hall from one another were ready. Well, we are now in the rooms and they are literally down the hall and around the corner from one another, hardly close as requested. But we’re exhausted and we have a tour/dinner to attend in an hour so we have to take the few moments we have to refresh rather than grab a quick nap and actually relax. The facility is brand new, guys are still painting the baseboards in the aforementioned hall even, but this experience has really soured us on the hotel. Mere apologies and a free drink really don’t compensate for this lack of communication, miscommunication, and delay. We’re returning to Dublin for several nights at the end of our trip and will not plan to stay here. Further, we’ll make sure to let people know to expect delays if they intend to stay here.",3,2019,09,05
243,Dissapointing,"Staying here tonight
Location is good but borders a rough area...caution needed especially at night
Lobby is nice and staff very helpful. There's a restaurant and bar and plenty of seating
Place is new so everything looks fresh
The room: view of council flats....not nice
Room itself looks new but on closer inspection and use it doesnt quite deliver 
It has a cheap feel. The materials used will not stand up to wear. Bed looked like it was made in a hurry and dust on surface missed by cleaning staff 
Dodgy light in bathroom kept blinking on/off and there was no ventilation even though ceiling fitting was there but not working
Shower glass screen not wide enough to contain spray from shower and floor flooded wven though shower was at low power.
Overall it's no better than a Travelodge or Ibis Budget.
I paid 161 euro for the room with no breakfast
On a side note the self service check in terminal didnt work and after processing payment didnt issue me a room key. Staff tried to help but wanted to process payment a second time..I refused and showed them my online bank statement showing payment.
So staff and location ( see above) are the pros...unfortunately the cons outweigh the pros in my opinion",3,2019,09,04
243,Scorching again!!! ,"Booked to stay in the city centre for the All Ireland final Dublin v Kerry, have to say the hotel is lovely, staff were a tad abnoxious, maybe they're looking for more classy clientele than a few Gaelic football fans, which is pretty ironic as the view out the window is of delapidated slum buildings with gangs hanging around selling drugs and drug addicts just up to mischief, and we were woken up at 2am to the sound of fire engines as there was a huge fire in the car park I think one of the cars was burnt-out. Crazy stuff altogether avoid this place it seems like a really rough part of Dublin City and there's better hotels located around the centre. ",1,2019,09,03
243,Dublin’s new little gem!,"Only opened this week and I can honestly say I don’t think this hotel has any teething problems. There is great attention to detail and the rooms are very bright and fresh, as well as modern! The hotel lobby and bar/restaurant are beautiful, they really hit the nail on the head for an all the people looking a great Instagram photo!! I will definitely be staying again",5,2019,09,02
243,Lovely stay for our last night in Ireland - everything we needed,"We got to stay at the Marlin Hotel on August 24th on their opening night. Everything was fantastic from the second our cab pulled up to the curb. The hotel manager and two staff members eagerly greeted us and took our bags inside. Check in was quick and trouble free and we were soon on our way to the room. Staff member James even offerred to bring our bags up to the room for us and refused our tip. 

The room was modern and had everything we needed from USB outlets, a large tv, a hair dryer (which is actually rare to find in Irish hotels lol), and a drawer under the bed literally large enough to fit our two full size luggages. The bed was so comfortable, it was the best sleep we had on our trip and the room featured black out blinds. 

They didn't have their full supply yet for the bar, but they worked magic with what they had. The cocktails were fantastic, and they were doing perfect pours with every beer or spirit. Great menu and fun staff to spend a bit of your evening with. Everyone we spoke to was nothing but charming or hilarious. :)

The breakfast was amazing!!! Literally everything you could imagine. Servers were on hand to clear plates, refill juice, coffee or tea, and make sure everything met your exdpectations. We enjoyed espresso and latte's and the buffet breakfast had eggs (scrambled and fried), bacon, sausage, black pudding, potato patties, fried beans and fried tomato, toast, pastries, all different kinds of cereal, fruit, yogourt and smoked meats and cheeses. 

Not to mention the bar, lobby and restaurant are just absolutely beautiful. 

We would love to come back some time!",5,2019,09,02
243,A lovely brand new hotel smack in the center of Dublin,"We stayed for 3 days, 2 nights for our visit to Dublin. Really enjoyed the modern, clean, brand spanking new building. We had a standard room, the bed in it is humongous- 2 by 2 meters. Yet it’s built  between the walls by the window, and it’s s bit awkward to get into.  Once you are in though, it’s very, very comfy. These are small European style rooms, not much space. If you don’t have a huge amt of luggage, you’d do just fine. We had one large suitcase and one carryon, worked out fine for us.  More than the accommodations, the staff is amazing. Everyone goes out of their way to help, from the desk staff, to restaurant servers, and must mention the concierges- we met two, Brian in the am and Marc in the eve. They did a great job, especially Marc went out of his way to help us negotiate some things to get the most of our time in Dublin. Can’t neglect mentioning breakfast, it amazing!!! Full Irish breakfast, plus continental, and they even have honeycomb!! Who has that?  Excellent value overall. Highly recommended ",4,2019,09,01
243,Stayed two nights loved it!,"We loved the new Marlin hotel. Great location, close to Lots of attractions( Grafton street, church where St. Valentine bones are, Thin Lizzy statue, lots of food places) Room was small but bed was super comfy the two shower heads and really big towels was a big plus. Even though it mid 60 we like sleeping with AC on most hotels dont have AC in Ireland. Staff was very welcoming and friendly and Marc went above and beyond with recommendations, morning Irish breakfast was delish! Would stay again next time we visit. ",5,2019,09,01
243,unforgettable:),A fabulous and cozy place to stay! My family and I enjoyed  wonderful experience  here. Every staff member did their best to fulfill our needs. The meals they provided were also surprisingly tasty. We'll choose Marlin again when we revisit Dublin!,5,2019,08,31
243,Raul,Was in town today went into the bar for a much needed cup of tea served by Raul full of chat made me feel so much at home it's a new hotel and with staff like this it will have a good future  ahead will be back,4,2019,08,29
243,All Ireland Weekend,I travel every year for the All Ireland Final and checked in to a very clean classy looking hotel with very friendly staff. In a great location and very nice Bar and Restaurant. Will be staying here for sure on future trips to Dublin from NY.,5,2019,08,29
243,Week end ,"Fantastic design reception best in Dublin must visit 
self service check in
 and a great reception very friendly and professional staff 
A new hotel so a few teething 
problems all new staff for this hotel coping very well I will be back 
",5,2019,08,28
243,POOR CUSTOMER SERVICE,"As the hotel is new, for marketing reasons they were giving away prizes. In July I had won a prize on a local radio station for 1 night B&B AND an evening meal. I contacted the hotel several times and was told the voucher was on its way but this was never the case. (they were answering phone calls even though the hotel was not open) I got onto the radio station and they promoted the hotel to hold up their promise and get in contact with me. I was eventually contacted by Lisa [-] the reservations manager via email who sent me a voucher stating 1 night B&B I advised this was wrong and I had one an evening meal according to the prize. The emails back and forth included unprofessional language such as weekend being spelled like 'wknd' etc. which is not what I would expect from a brand new hotel trying to make a good name for themselves in such a competitive industry. I advised via email three or four dates I could come over the next two to three months however the reply advised I can only book on specific voucher allocation weekends which involved none of the above and was offered only weekends which I specifically said I was not available. I believe I am being treated so poorly as I am not technically a paying customer which is completely wrong. I don't think I have ever written a negative review so writing this says a lot. I am hoping that by the time they have availability or as they like to say a ""voucher allocation"" weekend (probably end of next year) that my thoughts on this place will change. The hotel has only opened a week and I know two different parties that have stayed here for business both solo travelers and were unimpressed with the staff and I feel if this was my business in the morning I'd like to know. I'm hoping I will be coming back to amend this review after my stay.",1,2019,08,28
243,First arrivals weekend of 24th August 2019,"On our taxi journey from Dublin Airport we was warned by the taxi driver that the hotel might likely still be closed as he had taken other guests the previous week to find the hotel still not ready to open.  What a relief it was when we pulled up to the hotel to be greeted by the concierge moving away some barriers and announcing that the hotel was opening that lunchtime and we were the first guests to arrive.

When we did check in later in the afternoon, we were very impressed by the friendliness of the staff and although there is also a self-service check-in service also provided through online screens in reception, there was staff on hand to take us through the process. 

As soon as you arrive into reception, you immediately get the feel for a very modern hotel. The decor, fittings and feel of this ground floor space which also houses the bar/restaurant, casual seating areas and what looked like a hot desk space to perhaps do work, certainly lived up to the 4 star rating of the hotel.

We was allocated a Cosy King room which was again ultra modern and in terms of size, the clue was in the name. The 2m x 2m bed took the full width of the room and with it being against the window wall it might make you think about how you sleep, especially if you are a couple. This said we thought the bed was one of the most comfortable we have every enjoyed in a hotel. 
At the foot of the bed (depending on direction of sleeping) was a large smart TV and the window had electronic closing privacy screen and blackout blind. There is no wardrobe as such, just three coat hangers against a very shallow wall cupboard. This was fine for our weekend, but I wouldn't say was very practical for any longer duration when guests had more clothes to hang. There was also a deep drawer space below the bed. 
The bathroom again was modern with a very pleasant rain type shower, sink unit and toilet. It was certainly a small space and functional rather than luxurious.
There is a room safe, but no tea/coffee making facilities which was our only disappointment with the room.
Breakfast was included in our stay and this was superb. An excellent range of hot and cold options and excellent service from restaurant staff.

From a location perspective, the hotel is 2 mins from Grafton Street and only 10 minutes walk to Temple Bar.  Should you go to the hotel in the near future, you might have to give some guidance to taxi drivers as we did note that some drivers had not yet heard of the hotel.

So in summary we loved the hotel and especially the staff that went out of their way to ensure the opening weekend went smoothly. We did learn that we effectively guinea pigs for the hotel opening and there was likely only a fraction of the normal number of guests staying there on that opening weekend. This said we would certainly stay there again and expect the Marlin to become a very popular Dublin hotel as it offers greater availability in the weeks to follow.

[Caution reading previous reviews as the hotel only opening on Saturday 24th August]",5,2019,08,26
243,Not open,Poor customer service. We had 2 rooms booked. Called ahead to let the hotel know we would be arriving late to be told Ot hasn’t opened yet. No email to inform us. EmIl filled later today. Not good enough.,1,2019,08,21
243,HOTEL NOT OPENED ,"My wife and I arrived to check into the Marlin Hotel in Dublin. Low and behold the hotel is not even open yet. We were greeted outside by hotel staff whom sent us to another hotel for our stay. I feel the hotel should have contacted the guests prior to arrival since our new hotel did not even have our reservation on file.

If booking Marlin hotel anytime soon it would behoove you to call ahead to make sure the hotel is even open yet. 

Although the hotel arranged for our stay at another hotel, it is not ideal to have guests show up to the Marlin and see it is not even open yet and be taxied to another hotel.",2,2019,08,21
243,Central and Brand New,"I stayed 3 nights only room. The location is very central. The property is new, modern and attractive. I used the bar for an aperitif, great. The room is as small as functional for short stays. We need to optimize the use of hangers a little. Regular hair dryer is provided. There is no minibar but every day they leave the water when they clean the room. Staff at the reception and at the very kind bar. Absolutely recommended.",5,2024,09,29
243,Excellent experience,"We chose this hotel on Recommendation of a friend who lives in Dublin. And in fact, the choice turned out to be very positive. Both for the location of the hotel, in the central area easily accessible in every part on foot and absolutely quiet. Then for the breakfast buffet very varied and pleasant both for sweet and savory products, both hot and cold. Then the thorough daily cleaning of the room and bathroom accessories. Very welcoming and kind staff. Ultimately a hotel to recommend, no doubt.",5,2024,08,22

243,"Claustrophobic room, in front of a wall with a sealed window.","The Comfortable King Room is little more than a 2 MT by 4 mt loculus, the bed occupies the entire width. The sealed window gives on a mute about 1 meter away. On the second day of stay the room was not redone and we had to protest to the reception to get it fixed. At 230 euros a night it's a real joke. Good location, modern bar and well served, but not enough.",2,2024,07,07

243,Great hotel not far from the center,"Clean and comfortable rooms. Huge bed (cosy king room) with very comfortable mattress.
The hotel is very elegant and equipped with every comfort. The only “flaws” were the lack of a mini fridge that in a 4 star hotel should always be there and the lack of a cabinet (there is only one chest of drawers to store everything together)",5,2024,06,26
243,"Friendly staff, only for 2/3 nights.","Nice structure, clean, very central with some flaws. Bed stuck, free only from the feet. No wardrobe, 4 hangers. Very small room. There is no place for suitcases. 
Very friendly and Italian speaking staff. No garage, but there is a 50% agreement with the garage opposite.",3,2024,06,04

243,Location more than excellent,"The hotel is in an exceptional location. You can go around the whole center on foot easily. In 7 minutes you arrive at Temple Bar, 15 minutes at O'Connol Street.

243,Finally in Dublin,"Clean, quiet and welcoming room. Clean bathroom and pleasantly hot and relaxing shower. Friendly and helpful staff.(special mention Victoria).

243,beautiful mini break in Dublin,"Hotel in a central and convenient location, never used the bus. Modern hotel with a particular design with original details. Sweet and savory buffet breakfast with a wide choice and excellent quality. Reception/restaurant staff very courteous and helpful. The independent check in/out is very practical but staff are always available. Located in a very quiet street. Returning to Dublin I would definitely book here again and recommend it.
The only negative note is that the room is too small and has no wardrobe which can only be good for one night stays and should not be proposed for longer stays like mine, and the bed is very uncomfortable as it is set between two walls and absolutely not practical, especially if you are no longer ""very young"". By booking again I would try to better understand what type of room is offered. Note on the mattress and pillows!",5,2024,05,05
243,Excellent stay.,"Registration is very easy and fast, there is always someone at the reception to help you. The room is very comfortable, just as it appears in the images. It has what it takes. The people at the bar are very attentive, they care about serving you, very friendly...!",5,2024,05,04
243,Magnificent experience,"This hotel was a wonderful discovery, for starters the location is excellent, you can reach the center in 10 minutes on foot.

243,Excellent hotel in the center,"Hotel in a central location, close to St. Stephen's Green park and various amenities. We reached all the points of interest on foot in a maximum of 20 minutes.
The hotel has a very modern, refined and welcoming decor, full of objects and paintings on display, and the staff is extremely kind, cheerful and helpful. The breakfast is rich and offers a large variety of dishes (sweet, savory, gluten-free, for vegetarians, fat-free, etc...) and this is certainly another strong point. We also tried dinner, the prices are in line with other restaurants in the area and the quality of the dishes is excellent.
Our room was small, but with a gigantic and comfortable bed. Everything clean and tidy. There was no wardrobe, there were only 3 hangers. The bathroom is small but the shower is spacious. It would have been useful to have an extra hook for towels and a shelf.
Overall a positive experience, we will definitely return. I advise!",5,2023,12,06
243,The hotel was very good and the service was excellent.,"We felt at home, they helped us with everything, questions, routes, recommendations of places, especially Daniel, Humberto, Cristina and another girl who spoke Spanish made our stay very welcoming. The hotel was also very comfortable, original in decoration and well-appointed.",5,2023,09,12
243,Not worth the price,"I always struggle to put negative reviews but I think it's really important to point out many things about this hotel that don't work and can be improved. Firstly the location is really fantastic for seeing Dublin, but that's about it. The room is tiny, with the bed having only one accessible side, the other having to continually climb over to get up; there is no wardrobe and you have to use the chest of drawers under the bed: when the chest of drawers is open the other cannot get on the bed, when one is on the bed the other cannot open the chest of drawers! The bathroom is very small: there is nowhere to put clothes, towels, etc. Cleanliness is really poor and must be constantly requested and there aren't even any products for washing, you have to take them from the trolley in the corridor. Our shower was blocked, the phone was dangling from the wall. The window doesn't open so you have to put up with any smell in this niche. The temperature of the air conditioner changes on its own and you find yourself either frozen or hot. The badge continuously demagnetizes. The TV keeps cutting out and has to be turned off and on again. We paid more than €1700 for eight nights (do the math and tell me if this hotel is worth this money). We tried to report things but were told yes with big smiles and absolutely nothing was resolved. I'm sorry because the staff is kind but in the end you give up asking and put up with the holiday in this place. Good breakfast. The lobby is full of nice and fun things but I would prefer to have the basic amenities. The American coffee in the little bar below is excellent.",2,2023,08,15
243,"Schönes Hotel, winzige Zimmer, völlig überteuert","Der erste Eindruck in der Lobby ist super, das Zimmer war allerdings winzig und vor allen war direkt vor dem Fenster eine Wand mit einem anderen Zimmer, somit musste immer die Jalousie unten sein, das ganze zu einem völlig überteuerten Preis, der selbst für Dublin Wucher ist",1,2023,06,25
243,Wonderfull,"Wir waren mit Lage, Service und Gastronomie des Hauses sehr zufrieden. Ideal auch für kurzen Aufenthalt. Zimmer geräumig und sehr sauber. Auch kleines Frühstück ist möglich. Preise in der Bar sind ortsüblich. ",5,2023,02,02

Beste Zimmergröße und bestes Bett in Dublin, das ich je hatte

Alles gut erreichbar- auch die Nähe zu allen Verkehrsmitteln perfekt

Buche das Hotel sicherlich wieder, wenn ich nach Dublin komme",5,2022,12,13
243,Nel cuore della città,"Hotel molto bello in stile moderno. Ottima posizione a due passi da Grafton street e St. Stephens Green, in pieno centro città ma comunque in zona molto tranquilla. Colazione ricca e buona ma un pò cara (17€ a persona). ",4,2022,12,13
243,Magnifica estancia,"Desde la llegada hasta la salida ha sido todo muy facil, comodo y  confortable. Buena ubicacion, limpieza, tranquilidad e ideal para descansar despues de estar todo el dia visitando la ciudad. Fuimos por ocio pero se ve que tambien es un hotel desde el que se puede trabajar con todas las comodidades por el ambiente que habia.
Si vuelvo a Dublin repetire sin dudas.",5,2022,12,12
243,"Bien, recomendable","Bien ubicado, bien cuidado. Simplemente la habitacion es tan minimalista que apenas habia sitio donde dejar tu ropa. Si vas 2 noches esta bien, pero para mas, es incomodo. 
Y la mampara de la ducha no cubre lo suficiente, porque termina salpicando el agua fuera, hagas como hagas",4,2022,12,05
243,Tutto fantastico,"Siamo stati 3 notti in questo albergo dalla posizione ottima. Camere sempre pulite, letto comodissimo. Moderno in ogni piccolo dettaglio e con personale pronto a rispondere ad ogni minima domanda. Lo consiglio vivamente. ",5,2022,11,25
243,Hotel carino ma secondo me non vale il prezzo,"Molto carino
L’hotel si presenta molto carino, con possibilità di check-in autonomi agli sportelli, una cosa davvero comoda e veloce 
Le stanze, per il prezzo, sono abbastanza piccole, mi aspettavo qualcosa in più 
Non c’è un armadio dove poter riporre i vestiti, la finestra non si può aprire quindi l’aria non circola in camera, altrettanto in bagno che è piccolo e senza finestra 
Ovviamente non c’è il bidet ma lo sappiamo ormai 
Nella hall c’è di tutto per sentirsi a proprio agio, acqua gratuita e una comoda stazione per i caffè cappuccini etc 
Il personale non mi è piaciuto molto, abbiamo chiesto informazioni ad un signore alla postazione check-in che ha risposto in maniera un po’ sgarbata, ma tutto sommato è stato un soggiorno piacevole",3,2022,10,10
243,"A due passi dalla via principale di Dublino, O’ Connel Street","Ottima posizione, vicinissimo alla via principale di Dublino e di fronte al parco St. Stephen, letto molto comodo, aria condizionata e pulizia della stanza giornaliera.
L’hotel ha una bella estetica interna e la hall è molto accogliente.
I prezzi non sono troppo economici.",4,2022,08,24
243,Una habitación ratonera,"Habitación ridícula, sin armario ni estante alguno. La ropa hay que dejarla dentro de la maleta en el suelo y junto a la puerta de la habitación. La cama encajonada entre las paredes y la ventana Tampoco hay toalleros. Una vergüenza de hotel para el precio que tiene",1,2022,08,22
243,Hotel a ottimo prezzo ,"Ho soggiornato in questo hotel a Dublino.
L'unica cosa che devo fare notare e per via delle 4 stelle è che in camera su 4 notti 2 abbiamo dovuto chiamare la reception perché mancavano gli asciugamani. Per il resto, servizio molto buono compresa la pulizia camere. Punto in più per la colazione con prodotti di qualità e molto varia. Hotel molto moderno e dal ceck in facile e rapido. È cmq presente il personale per assistenza.
Ci tornerei lo consiglio. ",4,2022,08,18
243,Para no volver!,"Pagamos en este hotel 1516 € por cinco noches.  A cambio recibimos:
Aunque pedimos con tres meses de antelación una habitación tranquila, nos asignaron una habitación sin insonorización que da a una discoteca con un nivel de ruido que imposibilitaba el descanso. La luz del baño funcionaba mal. A las dos de la madrugada, cuando finalmente habíamos podido conciliar el sueño, una persona de recepción entró en nuestra habitación dándonos un susto formidable. Solo hay limpieza de las habitaciones cada tres días, y por 300 €/noche, no pudieron proporcionarnos un cepillo de dientes, cuando pedimos uno. Aunque era una habitación doble, el espacio es menor que el de un camarote de barco, hay una única silla y no dispone de cafetera, tetera, ni mueble bar. 
Tras quejarnos repetidamente nos cambiaron de habitación la tercera noche y nos ofrecieron una bonificación del 20%  en la siguiente reserva como compensación  por las molestias. Pero cuando volvimos y pedimos que aplicaran el descuento prometido, la respuesta fue que no podían aplicar ninguna bonificación porque la reserva se había hecho a través de un tercero.  Así que pagamos la reserva completa ya a la hora en que llegamos resultaba muy complicado buscar otro hotel. Tras presentar una queja formal  a nuestra vuelta, solo nos ofrecen una compensación del 20% en nuestra próxima reserva siempre y cuando la gestionemos directamente con ellos. Como si después de la experiencia quedaran ganas de volver a reservar en la cadena Marlin!!!!

243,Tolle Lage im Stadtzentrum,Perfekte Lage im Stadtzentrum. Leider war unser Zimmer in der Nähe einer Bar und die Musik konnte man lautstark miterleben. Weiters gibt es keinen Föhn und die Zimmer werden nur alle drei Tage gereinigt. Ansonsten hatten wir einen sehr angenehmen Aufenthalt.,4,2022,05,31
243,Excelente opción en Dublin,"Hotel moderno y muy bien ubicado, las habitaciones son un poco estrechas aunque debo confesar que la cama era súper cómoda y el tv era de muy buen tamaño. El baño era bastante cómodo y los amenities eran de muy buena calidad. El desayuno exquisito. La atención del personal un poco fría.",4,2022,05,23
243,Carisimo para lo que brinda,"Es un hotel solamente para utilizarlo de paso es decir dos noches como máximo, dado a que el servicio de habitaciones es prácticamente nulo. De 18 días de estadía solo cambiaron la ropa de cama en 3 oportunidades y las toallas debiamos prácticamente nosotros pedir que las cambien, pese a dar quejas en recepcion de todas estas incomodidades, que en mas de una oportunidad ellos mismos nos proveían de las cosas. El personal salva las situaciones dado a la mala organizacion del sistema de asistencia en la habitación. El desayuno es abundante pero el que esta acostumbrado a tomar el café bien caliente que se olvide ya que al ser de máquina se enfría rápido, el servicio del personal excelente excepto una encarga llamada, Yanina, creo, que tiene un poquito los humos subidos y debería ser un poco más cortez con los huéspedes y no mal educada como ha demostrado que es.
Otro defecto es la poca ventilacion dado a tener solo ventanas fijas.
Se puede categorizar 4 estrellas solo por su ubicación el resto deja que desear.
No sirve de mucho el que sea tan moderno en su ambientación si el servicio no cumple con lss expectativas que crea dado el precio.
No lo recomendaria",2,2022,04,30
243,Alojamiento moderno y funcional en el centro de Dublin,"Hotel actual y, funcional , el personal muy amable, la habitación era mínima pero con todo lo necesario, la cama y las almohadas muy confortables, la limpieza buena pero la hacen cada dos días, el desayuno bufete  muy completo y de buena calidad, buena localización para visitar la ciudad sin utilizar transporte y tienes la opción si llegas en coche de aparcar en el parking de enfrente por 10€ al día. Yo si que lo recomendaría..",3,2022,04,21
243,Muy caro para un mal servicio,"Muy declinado por un hotel de 4 estrellas. Muy caro, pero con un pésimo servicio. No cambian ni las sábanas ni las toallas no hacen el aseo diariamente. Cuando mi fue a quejar, me trajeron toallas, shampoing y acondicionador. Ni gel ni jabón de mano. El día anterior a mi salida, una pareja estaba esperan a las 17:30 que le dieran la llave de su cuarto, cuando el check-in es a las 15:00. Es un hotel que definitivamente no regresaría.",2,2022,04,10
243,Jon,"Un hotel malo, el servicio no se corresponde con el precio. Al llegar nos pidieron que hiciéramos auto-checkin no funciono.

243,Ubicación Excelente pero habitación standard diminuta,"La ubicación del hotel es excelente -en pleno centro de Dublín. El personal es encantador. El hotel está nuevo y la decoración es muy bonita. A tener en cuenta el tipo de habitación que se elige, porque nosotros no nos fijamos y la habitación standard es diminuta- no hay armario ni casi sitio para dejar maletas (eso sí, ofrecen un servicio de consigna para dejarlas, pero no lo veo práctico puesto que no me parece muy útil deshacer toda la maleta para bajarla al servicio de consigna). Otro punto a tener en cuenta, aunque nos ha pasado en otros hoteles de Irlanda, es que estuvimos dos noches y nos encontramos con la habitación sin hacer a la vuelta de nuestras visitas del primer día  -tuvimos que llamar a recepción para que nos entregasen toallas nuevas. El desayuno muy bueno.",4,2021,09,12
243,Bella struttura ma rifanno le camere ogni tre giorni,La struttura è moderna e pulita ma il servizio davvero non all’altezza. Con la scusa del COVID le camere vengono rifatte ogni tre giorni: inqualificabile. Non costa come una bettola e il cliente non merita questo servizio. Pessima scelta quindi.,1,2021,08,15
243,Vergognoso,"Passata la prima notte in hotel, siamo tornati nel pomeriggio per rilassarci un po’ ed abbiamo trovato la camera non sistemata. Abbiamo, quindi, chiesto alla reception la pulizia di rito e ci siamo sentiti rispondere che la cameriera sistema la camera ogni tre giorni…quindi per noi niente pulizia della stanza, visto che rimaniamo solo 2 notti. Ora, considerando che sul pavimento c’è la moquette, che il letto va rifatto e che siamo in periodo COVID, direi che il servizio è vergognoso e che l’albergo è, decisamente, sporco. Se avessi saputo una cosa del genere non vi avrei MAI soggiornato. Ripeto, vergogna! ASSOLUTAMENTE DA EVITARE.",1,2021,08,15

243,Zentrales Stadthotel,"Die Lage des Hotels ist für eine Städtereise perfekt. Man kann alle bekannten Sehenswürdigkeiten in wenigen Minuten zu Fuß erreichen. Eine Haltestelle der Straßenbahn ist um die Ecke. Nur zur Haltestelle des Airport Shuttles muss man ca. 10 Minuten laufen.

243,Ottima posizione ma la stanza é un loculo ,"Hotel molto carino, a pochi minuti a piedi dal centro. Ristorante con prezzi nella media. Buona colazione a buffet. Personale molto gentile. 

Unico neo la stanza. Non so se sono tutte così ma la nostra era un loculo di 2 mt per 5 bagno incluso. Il letto è incastrato sul lato corto, sotto la finestra, quindi vi si accede da un lato solo! In aggiunta é alto, perché non essendoci armadio nella stanza (solo tre grucce attaccate a una sbarra), sotto al letto c’è un cassetto (!). Non è adatto a persone con difficoltà motorie o ad anziani.

Il bagno è minuscolo e senza sfiato ma la doccia è grande.  Infine, la stanza non ha ricambio d’aria se non l’aria condizionata.

No, no, no!",1,2019,09,16
243,Troppa modernità,"L'hotel era aperto da due giorni, e lo staff, sempre cordiale, si è prodigato al massimo per sopperire agli inconvenienti dovuti a un'iniziale disorganizzazione (keycard non funzionanti, camera non rifatta, errata richiesta di addebito, pos non funzionanti). Ma questo hotel è l'esempio di come la tecnologia e la modernità a tutti i costi non sempre sono al servizio dell'uomo. 
Il piano terra dell'hotel è molto spazioso e moderno, con bar e molti posti dove sedersi e lavorare al computer, sicuramente un hotel più votato alla clientela business.
All'arrivo e al check out abbiamo dovuto sottostare alle tempistiche delle loro postazioni fai da te (utilizzate dal personale), un po' macchinose, molto tecnologiche, ma che hanno reso il processo più lungo.
La posizione è perfetta, in una via silenziosa ma proprio in centro.
La colazione a buffet è buona, affettati, salmone, uova, bacon, fagioli, frutta, latte, yogurt, cereali, pane e qualche dolcetto. In sei giorni però non hanno mai variato nulla.
La nota dolente è la camera king. E' un locale striminzito, con finestra non apribile, occupato quasi interamente dal letto, enorme e comodissimo, ma incassato fra tre pareti. Chi dorme sul lato del muro deve scavalcare l'altro occupante ogni volta che sale o scende dal letto, non ha comodino, né prese elettriche. Non c'è una luce personale per leggere. Chi ha rifatto la camera non è mai riuscito ad azzeccare il verso giusto del piumone matrimoniale, e come dargli torto, e non oso immaginare come abbia fatto a cambiare il lenzuolo di sotto a un letto di 2 metri per due se non camminandoci sopra. Non c'è armadio, solo tre grucce alla parete e un cassettone scomodissimo sotto al letto. Il bagno è molto piccolo, gli asciugamani rimanevano sempre bagnati e dovevamo farli cambiare tutti ogni giorno, alla faccia della salvaguardia dell'ambiente.
Non ci siamo trovati male, ma sinceramente il mega tv con netflix e chromecast, le prese usb dappertutto, l'audio del tv in bagno non bastano, non a una coppia in viaggio per turismo. Hotel perfetto per singoli che fanno brevi viaggi di lavoro. Ci sono anche camere più grandi, ma sul nostro piano erano poche.
Ho usufruito di un ottimo sconto su booking, a prezzo pieno non varrebbe la pena.",3,2019,09,07
243,"HOTEL NO INAGURADO A TIEMPO , PERO NO JUSTIFICADO","El 21 de agosto tenía contratado el hotel  (desde abril 2019), con otras compañeras, que lo hicierón después , (finales de Julio)  y el taxista ya nos comento,  que estaba cerrado. Cuando llegamos al hotel nos encontramos con mucha gente que esperaban con la lista.Me parece un super fraude que hagas una reserva en tiempo y nadie te informe de lo ocurrido. Por cierto fuimos a otro hotel de la zona el Hotel Conrad , pero ya desde un principio tuvimos que cargar un cargo de 50 euros por día, quisiera o no el cargo. Muy mala experiencia deben informar desde un principio , que no ibamos a este hotel. Por cierto la mediación fue booking nunca habia tenido problemas con ellos, creo que tampoco sabian nada.",1,2019,09,04
243,Absolut inkompetentes Team,"Ich glaube nicht, dass man dort wohnen sollte. Wir hatten gebucht und das Hotel konnte nicht eröffnen. Wir wurden umgebucht und schlecht informiert . Als Entschädigung wurde uns ein Gratiszimmer versprochen, aber nichts wurde eingehalten. Finger weg von dem Hotel. Geht besser in das Trinity College City Center, nett, sauber, freundlich, und RELIABLE! (verlässlich!).",1,2019,08,22
243,Professionalità,"Prenotato per un weekend a Dublino, al nostro arrivo abbiamo scoperto che i lavori  non erano stati terminati e che quindi l'albergo ancora non era stato aperto. Siamo stati accolti da Nadia, che con estrema cortesia ha cercato di rassicuratci, comunicando che saremmo stati accompagnati in un albergo vicino dove avremmo soggiornato per il periodo che avevamo prenotato. Marlyn (ed in particolare Nadia) vincono per professionalità,  disponibilità nonostante l'imprevisto ritardo di consegna! Tanto più visto che l'albergo in cui siamo stati trasferiti aveva parecchie stelle! Quindi, ancora una volta grazie Marlyn!",4,2019,08,19
