58,Good apartment to oak up Gracia neighbourhood life,"Our family holiday at Christmas worked out really well at this apartment.  We stayed in the ground floor apartment with small courtyard.  The second bedroom was perfect for our daughter — but a fourth guest would need to use the sofa bed in the living area. Wi-fi good, TV basic, kitchen equipment basic, bathroom OK.  It was clean and comfortable.  We had a security card to get into the building and the apartment — better than a key.  Location was great: a few blocks from Diagonal metro, so we could wander around the restaurants and cafes of Gracia. The apartment does not look like much from the outside but it’s actually good and the Feelathome staff were good. Gracia worked out well for us: it’s a 15-20 minute walk to Catalunya, so it’s a separate world but close enough to all the main places to visit. ",4,2022,12,27

We could not re","my overall assessment is pretty good. unfortunately there was one drawback. the fold-out couch was broken, which unfortunately made it impossible to use it completely and made it impossible to rest during the stay. during the holiday, we used the apartment only while sleeping, so unfortunately we could not use it fully, for which we paid. Unfortunately, there was also no reaction from the staff to the reported faults. contact with them was nice but it only concerned matters related to accommodation. such an important matter as the bed in the apartment remained unanswered. we are sorry",2,2022,05,06
